goals, therapeutic modalities and outcome measures. Treatment planning will be an ongoing
process and collaborative with the patient. FAP providers must coordinate with MH/ADAPT
providers when the patient is seen by two or more elements in the Flight; the FASOR-generated
intervention plan may be shared with the MH/ADAPT provider to support MH treatment
planning but may not be placed in the MH record since it contains patient care goals for other
family members. (T-1)

Reserve Component position. (T-1)

(Replace) 5.4.1. All patients will be briefed on the possible need for transfer of information
upon transition as part of the initial orientation to the MH Clinic, ADAPT Program, or FAP.
This briefing will be provided verbally, documented in the clinic record, and will also be
incorporated as part of the initial confidentiality/consent to treatment paperwork reviewed and
signed by the patient (see Attachment 4). (T-0, DoDI 6490.10)

(Replace) 5.4.2. The MH Flight will obtain, from the MPF, a monthly listing of individuals
identified for PCS departure. MH Flight staff will check the previous 180 days of clinic files and
the electronic medical record for records (to include use of BHOP services) of transferring
personnel. When clinic records are identified, each case will be reviewed to determine
appropriate action as outlined below. (T-1)

(Replace) 5.4.3.1. For cases requiring transfer, the MHP shall contact the MHF CC and/or their
designee at the receiving base to coordinate direct MHP to MHP communication as clinically

the gaining base, contact information and an appointment. (T-0, DoDI 6490.10)

(Add) 5.4.3.1.4. Patients with open cases who are separating from the military or transitioning
to a participating Reserve Component position will be encouraged to arrange follow-up care with
a MHP/health care facility at their next duty station/living location prior to their departure.

MHP/health care facility for which the patient has provided contact information and release of
information approval. (T-0, DoDI 6490.10)

(Add) 5.4.3.1.4.1. The patient may choose to utilize the InTransition program as described in
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Memorandum, “Department of Defense
inTransition Program,” January 12, 2010, to assist with the transition. The program will also
help Service members locate a suitable, non-military MHP. (Information on the InTransition
mental health coaching and support program is available at
http://www.health.mil/InTransition/default.aspx). (T-0, DoDI 6490.10)


(Replace) 5.4.4.1. All closed cases will be reviewed to ensure that prior care had been
appropriately terminated; there is no need for ongoing follow-up; and/or whether or not out-
processing is required with the MTF in which the patient received care. (T-0, DoDI 6490.10)



8
(Add) 5.4.4.2. All closed cases of service members who are PCSing or transitioning to a
participating Reserve Component position will also be reviewed to assess risk of adverse mission
impact. Particular attention should be given to review of cases involving a diagnosis of
substance dependence, cases of family maltreatment that met criteria at CRB, but were closed as
unresolved or previous suicide attempt. When a reviewing MHP cannot adequately assess the
stressors likely to be encountered in a new working or living environment, the MHP should
query his/her counterpart at the gaining base in order to determine appropriate action. For ARC
members the MHP should query the respective ARC medical unit Flight Surgeon or credentialed
provider at the gaining base. If it is determined the risk of adverse mission impact warrants MH
intervention, the provider at the losing base will follow the same procedures noted above for
transferring open cases. (T-0, DoDI 6490.10)

(Replace) 5.7.1. CDEs will be conducted IAW DoDI 6490.04, AFI 44-109 and this instruction.

recommendations for service members under their authority to seek care from a MHP when
circumstances do not require a CDE based on safety or mission concerns. Under such
circumstances, the commander or supervisor will inform the service member that he or she is
providing a recommendation for voluntary self-referral and not ordering the care. This will not
trigger a CDE IAW DoDI 6490.04, Enclosure 3, 3.a. (T-0, DoDI 6490.04)


(Add) 5.7.1.3. Commanders and supervisors will develop a culture of total well-being of service

duty not previously addressed by the MHP, a CDE will be initiated. Supervisor is defined as a
commissioned officer within or out of a Service member’s official chain of command, or civilian
employee in a grade level comparable to a commissioned officer, who: exercises supervisory
authority over the Service member owing to the Service member’s current or temporary duty
assignment or other circumstances of the Service member’s duty assignment; and is authorized due
to the impracticality of involving an actual commanding officer in the member’s chain of command
to direct an MHE. IAW DoDI 6490.04 Enclosure 3, 2.a. and Glossary, Part II. (T-0, DoDI

or supervisor regarding the appropriateness of a CDE versus other options. (T-0, DoDI 6490.04)


(Replace) 5.7.5. The assigned MHP will determine the appropriateness of the requested CDE
based on whether it will assist the commander or supervisor in answering specific duty-related
and/or safety questions. The MHP will also determine whether the CDE is being requested
properly IAW DoDI 6490.04.
(T-0, DoDI 6490.04)

(Replace) 5.7.7. Before the initial appointment, MHPs will obtain the proper CDE information
IAW DoDI 6490.04 and AFI 44-109. They will ensure that the commander or supervisor
followed the proper process for initiating the CDE. On intake for evaluation, MH staff shall
ensure the member understands they are being evaluated at the direction of the commander or
supervisor. (T-0, DoDI 6490.04)

         MENTAL HEALTH (MH) CLINIC CONFIDENTIALITY/RELEASE OF
                         INFORMATION SHEET

Patients are often unsure what to expect in a mental health (MH) clinic. We encourage you to
consider the following points regarding MH care and to discuss them with your MH provider if
you wish. You can expect the attention, respect, and best professional efforts of your MH
provider. Your MH provider will treat you as a responsible individual and will expect you to
take an active part in your treatment. You should also expect to take part in the treatment
decisions.

You should understand the goals and direction therapy is taking, and if you do not understand,
you should ask. Before initiating a professional evaluation or treatment relationship with a MH
provider, we want you to know about privacy ground rules. Generally, information discussed
during the evaluation and treatment sessions is confidential and may not ordinarily be revealed to
anyone outside the clinic without your permission. Under some circumstances including but not
limited to those listed below, information may be released without your permission.

A. Records of Care for All Patients. Every clinical visit to MH is documented in the
electronic medical record and marked as sensitive. Generally, only healthcare providers are
allowed to view these sensitive records if needed. It is important that providers caring for you in
other clinics be aware of the care you are receiving here. If there is a hard copy record, the MH
record of RegAF (Regular Air Force) members will be transferred to the MH clinic at the gaining
installation at the time of Permanent Change of Station (PCS). At the time of retirement or
separation of RegAF members, the MH record will be maintained at the installation MH clinic in
accordance with existing records disposition schedules. For military dependents, who are
actively involved in treatment at the time of PCS, the provider will discuss the option of
transferring care/records. However, records will not be transferred to the gaining installation
without the military dependent’s consent.

B. Disclosure Policy for All Patients. All medical and mental health records are protected by
the Privacy Act and HIPAA. Most information related to treatment of the military dependents is
not releasable without written consent. Some of the instances excluded from consent
requirements are quality assurance reviews by other mental healthcare providers (MHPs) and
collection of information for medical research. There may also be some rare instances where we
are required to disclose your record in response to a court order or other lawful demand if an
exception to the general rule of confidentiality applies.

C. Disclosure Policy Exceptions for Military Dependents:




14
1. Child or Spouse Maltreatment. Providers must report suspected child abuse or neglect to
military agencies and/or local child protective authorities. Providers may also be required to
report other family maltreatment incidents.

2. Crimes or Fraud. Providers must report any threat to commit crimes or fraud.

3. Danger to Self or Others. Providers must take steps to protect individuals from harm when
they have reason to believe there is a serious threat to the life or safety of self or others.

4. Pursuant to a court order or other lawful demand.

D. Disclosure Policy for RegAF and ARC (Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard)
members. Command notification by healthcare providers that a RegAF or ARC member has
sought and/or is in MH treatment or is taking medication may not be required when you
voluntarily agree to MH care. The following exceptions apply, and healthcare providers must
notify your Commander if you meet one of the below criteria:
1. Harm to Self. The provider believes there is a serious risk of self-harm either as a result of
the condition itself or medical treatment of the condition.

2. Harm to Others. The provider believes there is a serious risk of harm to others either as a
result of the condition itself or medical treatment of the condition. This includes any disclosures
concerning child abuse or domestic violence.

3. Harm to Mission. The provider believes there is a serious risk of harm to a specific military
operational mission. Such serious risk may include disorders that significantly impact
impulsivity, insight, reliability, and judgment.

4. Special Personnel. The RegAF or ARC member is in the Personnel Reliability Program as
described in DoD Instruction 5210.42 or is in a position that has been pre-identified by Service
regulation or the Command as having mission responsibilities of such potential sensitivity or
urgency that normal notification standards would significantly risk mission accomplishment.

5. Inpatient Care. The RegAF or ARC member is admitted or discharged from any inpatient
mental health or substance abuse treatment facility. These types of facilities are considered
critical points in treatment and support nationally recognized patient safety standards.

6. Acute Medical Conditions Interfering With Duty. The RegAF or ARC member is
experiencing an acute mental health condition or is engaged in an acute medical treatment
regimen that impairs the member’s ability to perform assigned duties.

7. Substance Abuse Treatment Program. The RegAF or ARC member has entered into or is
being discharged from a formal outpatient or inpatient treatment program for the treatment of
substance abuse or dependence.

8. Command Directed MH Evaluation. The mental health services are obtained as a result of
a command-directed mental health evaluation.



15
9. Crimes or Fraud. Providers must report any threat to commit crimes or fraud.

10. Pursuant to a court order or other lawful demand

11. Other Special Circumstances. The notification is based on other special circumstances in

which proper execution of the military mission outweighs the interests served by avoiding
notification, as determined on a case-by-case basis by a health care provider (or other authorized
official of the medical treatment facility involved) at the O-6 or equivalent level or above or a
commanding officer at the O-6 level or above.

In making a disclosure based on the circumstances described in subparagraphs 1-10 above,
healthcare providers shall provide the minimum amount of information to satisfy the purpose of
the disclosure. In general, this shall consist of:

1. The diagnosis; a description of the treatment prescribed or planned; impact on duty or
mission; recommended duty restrictions; the prognosis; any applicable duty limitations; and
implications for the safety of self or others.

2. Ways the Command can support or assist the RegAF or ARC member’s treatment.

F. Second Opinion Process for RegAF or ARC Members: If you disagree with the
recommendations made to your Commander, you can discuss this with your provider, the MTF
Patient Advocate, and/or your Commander. Additionally, if you have a potentially disqualifying
condition, you have the option of seeking a second opinion IAW the provision of AFI 10-203,
Duty Limiting Conditions.

G. High Interest Log (HIL). When a provider considers a patient (RegAF, ARC, and military
dependents) to be a serious risk for harming themselves or others, the patient is placed on the
MH clinic HIL. In order to better coordinate care and ensure safety, the cases of patients on the
HIL are discussed at weekly MHC meetings, and the names are shared with family practice
providers and the MDG Emergency Department. This practice is in accordance with military
and DoD policy. Your provider will inform you if/when you are placed on the HIL and when
you are removed from it. Patients on the HIL will be required to speak with their provider for a
brief status check when calling the clinic. If a patient on the HIL fails to arrive for a scheduled
appointment, the provider will attempt to make phone contact. If the provider cannot locate or
contact the patient within one hour, the provider may contact other persons or agents in order to
ascertain the patient’s location and status in order to ensure the patient’s safety. Other persons or
agents the provider might contact include, but are not limited to, the patient’s Commander, first
sergeant and Security Forces, as appropriate. Should a RegAF, high risk patient decline to
reschedule an appointment the member’s Commander will be notified. Commanders of
members must be informed when one of their personnel is placed on or removed from the HIL.

H. Continuity of Care. Regarding RegAF and ARC members, information may be released for
purposes of official military processes such as Medical Evaluation Boards or Commander



16
Directed Evaluations. In all cases (RegAF, ARC, and military dependents), information may
also be shared between military and non-military providers in certain instances in order to
facilitate medical care (e.g., when a patient is referred to a civilian provider or hospital).

I. Coordination of Care at the Time of Permanent Change of Station (PCS) and Transfer
of Information. The care/records of any RegAF members requiring ongoing treatment at the
time of PCS will be transferred to the MHC at the gaining base for follow-up to ensure
continuity of care. This transfer will be discussed with the RegAF member, but does not require
the RegAF member’s. However, every effort shall be made to involve RegAF member in the
process. In cases of RegAF members who have terminated treatment, records are reviewed prior
to PCS and the hard copy mental health record (if there is a hard copy record) will follow the
member along with the dental and medical records. If there are concerns, the RegAF member
may be contacted by a provider for a status check, and the provider will determine if follow up
care will be recommended at the gaining base. For military dependents, who are actively
involved in treatment at the time of PCS, the provider will discuss any need to transfer
care/records. However, records will not be transferred to the gaining installation without the
military dependent’s consent. Closed records on military dependents are also reviewed prior to
PCS. If the reviewing provider has concerns about elevated risk, the provider may contact the
military dependent for a status check and determination of any need to transfer the record.
Again, this records transfer cannot be accomplished without the individual’s consent.

J. Profiles/Duty Limiting Conditions for RegAF and ARC Members. MHC providers will
consult with Commanders and/or first sergeants any time they feel a RegAF, AFR, or ANG
member has a condition or circumstance that makes him/her not fit for duty, deployable or
requires any changes in his/her normal duties.

K. Drug or Alcohol Abuse by RegAF and ARC Members. Providers must report all
suspected instances of drug/alcohol abuse by RegAF, AFR, and ANG patients to rehabilitation
programs (ADAPT) and Commanders. Per AFI 44-121, a member may voluntarily disclose
evidence of personal drug use or possession to the unit Commander, first sergeant, substance
abuse evaluator, or a military medical professional. Commanders will grant limited protection
for members who reveal this information with the intention of entering treatment. Commanders
may not use voluntary disclosure against a member in an action under the Uniform Code of
Military Justice (UCMJ) or when weighing characterization of service in an administrative
separation.

L. Appointment Cancellation and No-Show Policy for All Patients. We ask that you give us
at least 24 hours’ notice if you will be unable to make an appointment you have scheduled. We
may try to use that appointment for another person seeking assistance from our clinic. If you
provide us with less than 24 hours’ notice, we will designate the appointment as a “no-show.”
Your provider may speak to you about whether continuing treatment makes sense if you have too
many “no-shows.” If you do not reschedule at the time of cancellation, a staff member will
contact you and offer a follow-up appointment.




17
M. Ancillary Staff/Trainees Involved in Patient Care. We operate the MHC under a team
concept approach. The team includes mental health technicians or clinician trainees who may be
involved in your care. You should address questions about this to your provider.

N. Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP). For family members of RegAF members
who receive care for mental health conditions, your provider must determine if your condition
would require enrollment in the EFMP. This may entail disclosure of your condition to proper
medical and Command authorities in order to ensure adequate medical care is available at any
projected new duty location. Enrollment in the EFMP is mandatory for the RegAF members
once the special needs of the family have been identified. Not all mental health treatment will
require this; ask your provider if you have any questions.

O. Medication Policy for All Patients. If medication is prescribed for you, it is imperative you
plan accordingly. Ideally we ask that you call seven days prior to running out of the medications
as to not disrupt the medication treatment course. You may request a medication refill if you are
actively under the provider's care and doing well. If not, we ask that you schedule an
appointment.

P. Telephone Consultations Policy for All Patients. Face-to-face treatment is always the
preferred treatment modality but is not always possible for your needs or clinic availability.
Telephone consultations are intended to assist in, not replace, the routine care you receive in our
clinic. We encourage you to contact your provider in this way any time between scheduled
appointments if you have questions or concerns about your condition or treatment. We ask that
you not communicate with your provider by e-mail.

            condition in the past, then there is documentation in AHLTA as to why the
            Airman no longer meets criteria for that diagnosis. Or if there is a current MH

1. The above named Service member was evaluated on (date) at (location) by (mental health
   provider’s rank and name) after referral by (rank and name of Service member’s
   commanding officer) for an emergency command directed evaluation (CDE) / a non-
   emergency command directed evaluation (CDE). Referral for CDE was determined to be
   appropriate by undersigned based on the following circumstances.




25
     Brief summary of circumstances related to referral. If SM has ever deployed to an
     imminent danger pay zone, indicate location and approximate dates in the last
     sentence of this summary.

     Prior to evaluation, the member was informed that he/she had been referred for
     evaluation by their commanding officer. Legal requirements, the CDE process, limits
     of confidentiality and potential career impact were reviewed with the member who
     expressed understanding.

2. The evaluation based on clinical interview and history, psychological testing,
   collateral interviews, review of SMs medical records, laboratory and radiological
   studies, PIF, and other documentation provided by the unit are revealed below:

     Brief summary of findings. Ideally, this section would contain only the referral
     questions and responses to them. IAW DoDI 6490.08, Enclosure 2, paragraph 9.c.,
     “Healthcare providers shall provide the minimum amount of information to satisfy
     the purpose of disclosure.” Explicitly answer the Commander’s referral questions.
     This may be best done by listing them individually with the answer beneath each. Do
     not summarize test results. Do not include background information. The
     Commander needs to understand the findings, not the personal details upon which
     those findings are based.

     These findings were made with full consideration of documentation provided by the
     unit that appropriate counseling, remediation, training and/or other corrective action
     by the unit has failed to produce the desired behavior change. This content may not
     be appropriate for CDEs based on single events such as reports of suicidal/homicidal
     ideation for which there has been no opportunity for unit remediation.

3. The diagnoses/diagnosis, based on current DSM, are/is:


4. The disorder is so severe that the member’s ability to function in the military environment is
   significantly impaired. The member is deemed unsuitable for continued military service on
   the basis of the above diagnoses/diagnosis.

     Briefly explain the rationale by directly connecting the diagnosis to examples of past
     impaired functioning/behavior and implications for future functioning/behavior.

5. The member’s diagnosis does meet retention standards for continued military service. The
   member has been assessed for the presence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and was
   determined to not meet criteria for this condition. There is no evidence that the member
   meets diagnostic criteria for any other condition (e.g. Traumatic Brain Injury) that would
   require referral to a medical evaluation board for administrative adjudication. The member
   has been informed and expressed understanding that separation based on the diagnosis does
   not qualify for disability benefits.




26
6. The Service member is considered imminently dangerous or potentially dangerous based
   upon summary of clinical data/rationale to support this determination.

7. The following clinical treatment plan has been initiated:

       a. The Service member has been admitted to ward and name of MTF or hospital for
          further evaluation, observation and/or treatment. His/her physician is rank/title and
          name who may be reached at telephone number.

                                                    OR

       b. The Service member has been scheduled for outpatient follow-up or treatment on date
          and time at name of MTF or mental health clinic with rank/title and name of
          privileged mental health provider who may be reached at telephone number.


8. RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE COMMANDING OFFICER: The Service member is
   returned to his/her Command, with the following recommendations.

       a. Precautions: (e.g., consider move into military barracks; prevent access to
          government weapons; consider efforts to secure personal firearms; consider
          leave/TDY restrictions [coordinate with mental health provider]; consider no contact
          order, consider requiring turning in to pharmacy previously issued medication;
          consider some form of unit or buddy watch, ensure use of direct handoff policy
          following investigative interviews, consider adjustments to assigned duties, etc.).
                                            AND/OR

       b. Process for administrative separation because the personality disorder is so severe the
          service member’s ability to function effectively in the military environment is
          significantly impaired.
                                            AND/OR

       c. The Service member is/is not suitable for continued access to classified material and
          his/her Secret/Top Secret Special Compartmentalized Clearance should be
          retained/rescinded.

                                            AND/OR

       d. The Service member is/is not recommended for Duty and/or Mobility Restrictions.
          Restrictions are: no access to weapons, no deployments, TDY, PCS. Restrictions
          expire: ______________

9. The above actions taken and recommendations have been discussed with the Service member
   who acknowledged that he/she understood them.
                                           OR


27
     The Service member’s condition/diagnosis prevents him/her from understanding the actions
     taken and recommendations made above.
                                           AND/OR

10. If you choose to non-concur on the mobility restriction, then you must contact the MTF
    Senior Profiling Officer within seven duty days of receipt of the mobility restricting AF Form
    469 (no contact from you will be considered concurrence) IAW AFI 10-203 3.4.1.1.,
    (reference (e)) to discuss and review the case. If you not concur, with the SPO
    recommendations, then notify your next senior Commanding officer.

MEMORANDUM FOR AFMOA/SGHW

FROM: XX MDOS/SGOW

SUBJECT: Clinical Review of Recommendation for administrative separation for SERVICE MEMBER
(20/XXX-XX-XXXX)

This report contains sensitive information; circulation should be limited to the fewest ‘need to know’
individuals. Information contained herein is personal and will not be disclosed to the public without
consent of the individual (AFI33-332, The Air Force Privacy and Civil Liberties Program).

1. XX’s Commander Directed Mental Health evaluation was conducted by PROVIDER, Licensed
Clinical Psychologist, on SERVICE MEMBER. The CDE resulted in the recommendation of the
administrative discharge of SERVICE MEMBER due to an adjustment disorder that is so severe that
his/her ability to function effectively within the military environment is significantly impaired, thus
making him/her unsuitable for continued military service.


2. I conducted an independent review of all materials associated with the CDE and agree with
PROVIDER’s diagnoses and recommendations. I also agree there is no evidence to support a
diagnosis of PTSD or other conditions that might warrant disability processing. The entire CDE
process and content is deemed thorough and appropriate and meets all requirements set forth in DoD
directives, AFIs, and AF policy regarding administrative separations of Airmen for adjustment disorders
who served in imminent danger pay areas.

reduce the incidence of family maltreatment and alcohol/drug misuse. Staff members assigned
to the RE are responsible for prevention in their area of expertise but will work in collaboration
and partnership on all efforts to maximize impact. The FAOM and FAN work directly for the
RE Chief; however, they also participate in the appropriate FAP staff meetings to maximize
coordination. Outreach and prevention efforts focus on the range of available MH services with
utilization of resiliency principals including the 12 Targets (see Attachment 2). The RE has
limited clinical care responsibilities so caution should be taken to ensure the element chief, if a

   continually manned during patient care duty hours.            External duress alarms will
   automatically notify SFS or other equivalent security personnel of the emergency and will be
   activated simultaneously with the internal duress system. Both systems will be tested
   quarterly.
   3.2.3. MH staff will be trained on duress procedures during initial in-processing. Duress

                                           Chapter 4

                      MH RECORDS & RECORDS MANAGEMENT

4.1. MH Record.
   4.1.1. A single integrated MH record will be established for each patient seen in MH. The
   MH record will contain all documentation created by ADAPT, FAP maltreatment services
   and MH. Use of a single MH record facilitates awareness and communication between
   treatment providers via a single integrated source for documentation of care. Attachment 3
   provides a table of the rules for this record. Note: This guidance applies to all new MH
   records. All existing, active records will either be converted to an integrated record or
   closed within one year of publication of this instruction.
   4.1.2. MH records are a separate category of record. A psychotherapy note recorded in any
   medium by an MH professional documenting or analyzing the contents of conversation
   during a private, group, joint or family counseling session is considered a MH record and
   will be maintained separate from the member’s medical record(s). MH records are protected
   from release by 45 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Subpart E, Privacy of Individually
   Identifiable Health Information, DoD 6025.18-R, DoD Health Information Privacy
   Regulation, AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program, and AFI 44-109, Mental Health,
   Confidentiality, and Military Law. Additionally, MH records that contain details of a
   patient's substance abuse treatment are protected by the federal confidentiality of substance
   abuse patient records statute, section 543 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 290dd-
   2 and its implementing regulation, 42 CFR part 2. All patient care provided in MH including
   ADAPT and FAP elements will be documented in the integrated MH record. (Note: The
   protection afforded the MH record by 45 CFR Subpart E and AFI 44-109 excludes the
   documentation of medication prescription and monitoring, counseling session start and stop
   times, the modalities and frequencies of treatment furnished, results of clinical tests and any
   summary of the following items: diagnosis, functional status, the treatment plan, symptoms,
   prognosis and progress to date).
   4.1.3. Each patient will have a single, integrated MH record with the following exceptions:
      4.1.3.1. Minor children seen for FAP evaluation only. If a minor child is seen for a FAP
      initial evaluation only and no MH record exists for the child, a separate record will not be
      created. The evaluation will be filed in the sponsor’s MH record. Documentation will be
      filed in the appropriate section and clearly labeled with the child’s identifying
      information. If the child is seen subsequently for FAP treatment, a separate MH record
      will be created and a copy of the FAP intake moved to their individual record.
      4.1.3.2. Geographically separated MH elements. At locations where a patient is being
      seen during the same timeframe in geographically separate clinics (i.e., ADAPT, FAP,
      MH), separate records may be temporarily created if transfer between clinics of a single
      MH record is problematic. Geographic separation is defined as clinics in separate
      facilities. Consideration of the importance and sensitivity of tracking duplicate records
      will be used to ensure close communication between the clinics using temporary separate
      records to coordinate services provided. When care ends at one of the geographically
AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011                                                                         15


      separated clinics, the documentation will be re-filed chronologically into a single MH
      record.
      4.1.3.3. TSR psycho-educational counseling. No record is required if a member is seen
      for TSR psycho-educational counseling (up to four meetings by any member of the TSR
      team) following a potentially traumatic event. These meetings must be for the purpose of
      education and consultation and not for medical assessment and treatment IAW AFI 44-
      153, Traumatic Stress Response.
      4.1.3.4. Educational, non-count patient activities. These contacts cannot involve
      assessment or treatment that results in diagnosis or documentation of communications as
      part of medical care.
      4.1.3.5. Non-military intimate partner services. Documentation of assessment, safety
      planning and referrals of non-military beneficiaries who are intimate partners seen as part
      of a FAP evaluation will go into their AD intimate partner’s record as a collateral contact.
      4.1.3.6. NPSP and FAST prevention records. These records are maintained separately
      IAW AF FAP Standard P-10 and P-12 as required by AFI 40-301.
   4.1.4. MH documentation will be in a six-part folder. The highest top right corner of the
   record will be labeled with:
      4.1.4.1. Patient’s last name, first name, middle initial and pay-grade (if applicable).

      4.2.2.2. Written Informed Consent/Patient Information Sheet.            There will be a
      standardized format approved for all MH Outpatient, FAP and ADAPT services. FAP
      clients must complete the approved AF Form 4405, Family Advocacy Program (FAP)
      Client Information Form Maltreatment Intervention Services. This form will describe
      services offered, hours of operation, rights and responsibilities of the patient, including
      the voluntary nature of services (unless commander-directed), privacy information, limits
      to confidentiality and mandated reporting requirements, after-hours emergency contact
      procedures and record transfer process upon PCS, separation and/or retirement. Patients
      sign and date the form (see Attachment 4 for an example).

     information forms, or locally developed MH element forms capturing patient
     demographics, contact information, reasons for seeking care, presenting complaints, prior
     history of treatment, current medications and other information as needed.
        4.2.2.3.1. The patient information form will ask if the patient is requesting services
        voluntarily. If the patient was directed by command for an MH evaluation,
        procedures described in AFI 44-109 must be followed. Involuntary FAP and ADAPT
        patients will be managed according to relevant AFIs.

      4.2.7.1. Initial assessment note completed by provider/technician.              (Note:
      Documentation filled out by patients will not be a part of the initial assessment note.
      Information forms filled out by the patient will be filed in Section A.)
      4.2.7.2. Documentation of patient care such as psychotherapy, group therapy, medication
      management, ADAPT treatment team meetings and other meetings.
      4.2.7.3. Psychological testing interpretation reports.
      4.2.7.4. HI [MCCC notes, High Risk for Violence Response Team (HRVRT), Child

      staffing notes.
      4.2.7.5. Termination/transfer notes.
      4.2.7.6. Administrative documentation such as patient no-shows, rescheduling of
      appointments, telephonic contact, etc.
   4.2.8. Documentation of assessments, interventions and/or treatment will be in SOAP
   format:
      4.2.8.1. Subjective (S): Includes information obtained from patient report, description of
      therapeutic encounter and other collateral information.
      4.2.8.2. Objective (O): Includes mental status information (e.g., affect, mood, cognition,
      etc.), testing results and other information observed or obtained regarding the patient.
      Suicidal and homicidal assessment must be documented at each session.
      4.2.8.3. Assessment (A): Includes American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual (DSM) assessment (All five Axes for initial assessment and
      termination notes; at least first three Axes for other notes), assessment of progress of
      treatment in relation to treatment goals and other appropriate assessment information.
      FAP providers will use this section to document assessment of risk for maltreatment. If
      diagnosable conditions are identified, they will also be documented.
      4.2.8.4. Plan (P): Describes the plan for further care if indicated or decision to terminate
      care. The plan will be sufficiently detailed so another provider can assume care if
      required. Prevention counseling may be documented in this section. Scheduling
      information (e.g., ―Return to clinic in one week‖) is not sufficient in and of itself.
4.3. MH Record Documentation Rules.
   4.3.1. All documentation will be filed in chronological order with more recent
   documentation filed on top of older documentation. Two-sided documents will be printed
   head-to-toe, if possible, to allow ease of reading.
   4.3.2. All handwritten entries will be printed or written legibly and signed.
   4.3.3. Entries will be made on approved forms or overprints IAW AFI 41-210.
   4.3.4. For each patient contact, a note will be accomplished for the MH record. All patient
   notes will be dated, have the clinic name at the top of the note and will have signature of the
   MHP with signature block below (name, rank, service, corps, duty title). Notes by non-
   privileged staff will be co-signed by a privileged provider. Refer to section 7.21. in AFI 44-
 18                                                                AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011


   119, Medical Quality Operations, for guidance regarding Certified Alcohol and Drug Abuse
   Counselor co-signature requirements.
   4.3.5. All collateral contacts, such as phone calls to commanders, first sergeants or family
   members, will be documented on an SF Form 600, Medical Record – Chronological Record
   of Medical Care, and filed in Section F of the MH record.
   4.3.6. Additional documentation requirements can be found for FAP in AFI 40-301 and the
   FAP Standards; for ADAPT in AFI 44-121.
   4.3.7. Provider corrections in hard copy notes will be made by lining through the incorrect
   data with one straight line, making the correction, initialing and dating the correction.
   Erasing, scratching-out, blotting, whiting-out or otherwise destroying the original data is
   prohibited. Enter the correct data next to the lined-through data. Amendments of erroneous
   data will be done by the originating provider. A brief explanation will be documented if that
   person is not available. When using electronic/computer formats for treatment notation,
   follow the appropriate procedures for amending the permanent electronic note (e.g., amend
   function for AHLTA).
   4.3.8. MH record documentation will be sufficiently detailed and organized to:
       4.3.8.1. Facilitate continuity of care, document patient safety or risk status and describe
       diagnostic and therapeutic procedures performed as well as the patient’s response to
       treatment.
       4.3.8.2. Enable another MHP (within the respective discipline) assuming care or
       providing adjunct care to clearly understand the rationale for diagnosis, treatment, care
       provided and treatment plan.
4.4. Treatment Planning Format. Documentation of patient care will detail, either in the
progress notes or in conjunction with a separate treatment plan, a clear explanation of the goals,
therapeutic modalities and outcome measures. Treatment planning will be an ongoing process
and collaborative with the patient. FAP providers must use the FASOR-generated intervention
plan.
4.5. Closure/Transfer Notes.
   4.5.1. Closure notes will be accomplished upon completion of MH care. A transfer note will
   be completed prior to transfer of care. See Attachment 5.
   4.5.2. In the MH Record, closure/transfer notes will contain the following information:
       4.5.2.1. Identifying information (Specify name, FMP/SSAN, duty position).
       4.5.2.2. Date case opened and date of last contact.
       4.5.2.3. Initial diagnosis.
       4.5.2.4. Brief description of the course of treatment, status and significant clinical
       presentation to include HI status and prognosis.
       4.5.2.5. Final diagnoses (Specify all five Axes).
       4.5.2.6. Impact on military duty performance. Comments will include profile changes
       and current profile; any duty impact and restrictions during course of treatment, currently,
AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011                                                                          19


      and anticipated at next assignment; MEB actions if taken; information impacting security
      clearance [omit personal details]; duty position of patient at termination [this is to support
      profile decisions in the event the patient is transferring from one job where profile was
      not needed to another position where it might be], and summary of any CDE
      recommendations, if the member underwent a CDE.
      4.5.2.7. Reason for termination or transfer (Specify whether completed treatment, no
      show/cancel, PCS, separation from the military, unknown, other).
      4.5.2.8. Recommendation for follow-up, if any.
   4.5.3. In the Medical or Health Record (HR), closure/transfer notes will contain the
   following information (see Attachment 6):
      4.5.3.1. Identifying information (Specify name, FMP/SSAN, duty position).
      4.5.3.2. Date case opened and date of last contact.
      4.5.3.3. Brief description of the course of treatment, status and prognosis (omit sensitive
      personal information).
      4.5.3.4. Final Diagnoses (Specify all five Axes).
      4.5.3.5. Reason for termination or transfer (Specify whether completed treatment, no
      show/cancel, PCS, separation from the military, unknown, other).
      4.5.3.6. Profile and duty restrictions.
      4.5.3.7. Recommendation for follow-up, if any.
4.6. HR Documentation.
   4.6.1. For each outpatient visit, an abbreviated entry will be made into the electronic medical
   record of the individual(s) seen, in sufficient detail to enable health care providers in other
   clinics to provide effective continuing care to the patient(s). Sensitive, personal information
   disclosed in therapy will not be entered into the HR. Documentation in the HR will include a
   brief description of treatment, medication prescription and monitoring, results of clinical
   tests, diagnosis, prognosis and progress to date.
   4.6.2. For AFR patients, a copy of each entry in the individual(s) HR should be immediately
   forwarded to the member’s Reserve Medical Unit (RMU) for placement into the member’s
   physical medical record.
   4.6.3. For MH and ADAPT, a brief SOAP note is required for:
      4.6.3.1. Initial assessment.
      4.6.3.2. Any treatment visit.
      4.6.3.3. Changes in diagnosis, profile, and/or therapy.
      4.6.3.4. When medication is prescribed, renewed, changed or discontinued.
      4.6.3.5. Closure or transfer.
   4.6.4. Other patient contacts (telephone, email, messages left at reception area) may be
   documented in the HR, but do not require a full SOAP note.
 20                                                                 AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011


   4.6.5. For FAP contacts:
       4.6.5.1. Briefly document in-person visits and closure or transfer summaries.
       4.6.5.2. If a child is engaged in treatment, then a separate record will be used.
   4.6.6. Missed appointments will be documented in the HR.
4.7. MH Record Closure.
   4.7.1. All open MH records must be reviewed at least every six months. Patients who have
   not had an appointment at the clinic for the past three months or longer and whose care has
   not been formally terminated should be referred to a MHP for further contact or for
   completion of a closure note IAW Section 4.5.
   4.7.2. Voluntary patients at no significant risk for suicide/homicide who choose not to
   continue care may be considered low risk for purposes of case closure. The MH record may
   be closed without further contacts at the provider’s discretion.
   4.7.3. Patients determined to be at mild risk will be contacted prior to case closure if they
   failed to attend scheduled appointments or requested to discontinue care prematurely. The
   provider will express safety concerns and make recommendations to the patient within a
   week of the first missed appointment. This encounter must be recorded in the MH record.
   MH staff will make at least three contact attempts before closing the case.
   4.7.4. Patients assessed to be at moderate or higher risk for suicide/homicide will be
   considered HI patients and will be rescheduled immediately in the event of a ―no show‖ for a
   scheduled appointment.
       4.7.4.1. The commander and/or first sergeant will be informed if contact cannot be
       established within one hour or the HI patient refuses follow-up.
       4.7.4.2. Closure of HI cases requires documentation of the provider’s rationale and
       safety or transfer plan.
       4.7.4.3. The commander or first sergeant will be informed of the intent to close an HI
       case and the plan to maintain patient safety.
4.8. Securing MH Records.
   4.8.1. MH records must be kept in a properly secured location in the clinic. Records will be
   stored under a double lock system (e.g., stored in a locked cabinet/file system in a locked
   room).
   4.8.2. MH records will not be removed from the MH Flight without MH Flight Commander
   approval or be left overnight in staff offices.
4.9. MH Record Retirement. MH records will follow the procedures for physical record
retirement IAW AFMAN, 33-363, Management of Records. The retirement schedule that
requires the longest retention of the record will be used. MH records will not be destroyed.
4.10. Release of Information.
   4.10.1. Patient’s information will be released IAW AFI 33-332, AFI 41-210, AFI 44-109
   and DoD 6025.18-R. If requested, a patient may be given a summary of their care by the
   patient’s provider.
AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011                                                                      21


  4.10.2. If disclosure of confidential communications is requested for the purpose of a
  criminal investigation or proceeding under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), the
  MHP must determine if an exception to the general rule of privilege applies to that
  disclosure. This will be done with consultation from the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA). This
  request for information will be handled IAW local MTF procedures for requesting
  information. Normally, the requesting agency must request information for investigative
  purposes in the form of questions directly to an MHP, not as a formal release of the entire
  record. Guidance on how to respond to subpoenas and court orders for MH records will be
  obtained from the installation SJA or medical-legal consultant.
     4.10.2.1. When release of information is determined to be required, the primary provider,
     element officer in charge (OIC), and/or the MH Flight Commander will review the record
     and make recommendations for redactions.
     4.10.2.2. Redactions are the act of blacking out information on copies of documents
     being provided that could be potentially harmful to the patient and/or others referenced in
     the documents. This information is determined through the provider’s clinical judgment
     but will be reviewed by the local SJA or (when available) the Medical Legal Consultant
     for guidance and support.
     4.10.2.3. Due to differing rules regarding confidentiality and release of information
     guidelines specific to FAP and ADAPT, refer to AFIs 40-301 and 44-121 for guidance.
  4.10.3. MH will coordinate with the MTF Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
  Act (HIPAA) privacy officer to track disclosures of protected health information.
 22                                                                AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011


                                           Chapter 5

                             MH TREATMENT PROCEDURES

5.1. Access to Care.
   5.1.1. MH will optimize the availability of its services to meet the needs of the enrolled
   population. The MH Flight Commander is responsible to ensure access standards are met,
   i.e., same day for emergent appointments, seven days for routine appointments. (Note: The
   ANG does not have MH Flight Commanders or military or DoD civilian MHPs to provide
   MH assessment, referral or treatment. ANG MH assessment and referral needs will be
   provided by contract position DPHs. Referrals for MH treatment will be made to community
   providers).
   5.1.2. MTF commanders will coordinate a plan for specialty care that is unavailable in the
   clinic (e.g., inpatient psychiatric care, child psychiatry, inpatient substance abuse treatment,
   etc.). If required, they will obtain memoranda of agreement with hospitals and other
   resources to facilitate care.
   5.1.3. Guidelines will be established for provision of MH care to ADAPT and FAP clients
   (AFI 44-121 and AFI 40-301). When assessing a patient’s need for treatment in ADAPT or
   FAP, MHPs will consider whether MH treatment would also benefit the patient.
5.2. High Interest (HI) Patient Procedures.
   5.2.1. HI status reflects a provider’s judgment that heightened monitoring is indicated and
   the threshold for proactive intervention is lower than that required for other patients.
   Therefore, any patient, including those seen in ADAPT and FAP, meeting these criteria can
   be categorized as HI. Patients who are judged to be a moderate or higher level of risk for
   psychological decompensation or significant maladaptive behavior will be categorized as HI.
       5.2.1.1. Patients assessed by the provider to be at moderate or higher suicide risk by
       definition are categorized as HI.
       5.2.1.2. Patients with homicidal ideation/intent or significant psychopathology rendering
       them unable to provide for their own wellbeing or their dependent children are other
       examples of HI patients.
       5.2.1.3. Patients being discharged from higher levels of care (i.e., inpatient or partial
       hospitalization for MH or substance issues) are categorized as HI and will be monitored
       over a sufficient period of time until clinical stability is well established.
       5.2.1.4. Any case that currently meets the criteria for the activation of the HRVRT,
       CSMRT or other teams as clinically indicated will be considered HI.
       5.2.1.5. A Primary MHP (PMHP) will be identified for each HI patient. Typically, the
       PMHP will be the MHP with the most contact with the patient.
       5.2.1.6. The PMHP will be responsible for ensuring coordination of care with other
       providers (e.g., MHPs, PCMs) and the patient’s commander.
       5.2.1.7. The PMHP will generally be responsible for entering and removing the patient
       from the high interest log (HIL). Patients will be placed on the HIL as soon as the
AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011                                                                      23


     provider makes that determination. Notifications to the patient’s PCM, the ED, the on-
     call MHP and the patient’s commander (if military) will be made the same duty day
     (ideally immediately and NLT the next duty day if determination is made after duty
     hours).
     5.2.1.8. When the patient or their immediate family member is placed on the HIL due to
     high risk and is on PRP/PSP status or holds a Top Secret or higher clearance, the MHP
     will ensure that appropriate notifications to the program monitors are made [refer to
     AFMAN 10-3902, Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability Program (PRP)].
     Notifications must be documented in the MH record and updated as needed.
  5.2.2. High Interest Log (HIL).
     5.2.2.1. The term ―high interest log‖ replaces the term ―high risk log‖ as referenced in
     AFI 44-102, Medical Care Management.
     5.2.2.2. MH will maintain a HIL.
     5.2.2.3. At a minimum, the HIL will contain the name of the patient, PMHP responsible
     for the coordination of the patient’s care, date entered onto HIL, diagnosis, nature of the
     risk (e.g., risk level, risk factors), PCM, command representative and the next scheduled
     follow-up appointment.
     5.2.2.4. Patients and commanders or first sergeants (in cases of military patients) must be
     apprised of the purpose and procedures of the HIL. Specifically, patients will know the
     policies for ―no shows‖ and their responsibility to contact MH if they are unable to attend
     a MH appointment.
  5.2.3. Multidisciplinary Clinical Case Conference (MCCC).
     5.2.3.1. An MCCC will be established for case management monitoring of patients on
     the HIL and other patients as needed. All MHPs will attend the MCCC on a weekly
     basis.
     5.2.3.2. Information necessary to coordinate care and manage risk will be shared with all
     MHPs and documentation of this coordination/case discussion will be placed in the MH
     record in Section F.
  5.2.4. Coordination and Continuity of Care.
     5.2.4.1. The HIL will be shared at least weekly with PCMs or their designees as well as
     ED providers if the facility has an ED. Significant changes in the risk status, treatment
     plan or precautionary measures must be communicated to the patient’s PCM or designee,
     the on-call MHP, the ED and the patient’s command (in cases of military patients)
     immediately (NLT next duty day if determination is made after duty hours).
     5.2.4.2. A designated MHP will discuss HI cases with MTF PCMs face-to-face at least
     monthly.
     5.2.4.3. The on-call MHP will be accessible to patients who are on the HIL when the
     PMHP is not available. When the PMHP anticipates being unavailable, the PMHP will
     inform other providers who will be covering any HI patients from his or her caseload.
24                                                               AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011


     5.2.4.4. MH staff will work with inpatient staff to ensure continuity of care before,
     during and after psychiatric hospitalizations. MH staff members will communicate with
     inpatient providers upon admission and discharge and at appropriate intervals throughout
     the duration of hospitalization (at least weekly).
     5.2.4.5. Following discharge from higher levels of care, such as inpatient psychiatric
     care, partial hospitalization programs or substance abuse rehabilitation, an MHP will
     assess military personnel for fitness for duty and safety the same day whenever possible,
     but NLT the next duty day after discharge. MHPs should strongly encourage civilian
     facilities to not discharge patients after duty hours and/or on non-duty days. If MHPs
     become aware of a discharge that occurs during non-duty hours, the MHP will
     collaborate with the patient’s commander to ensure that an adequate safety plan is
     established until the patient can be evaluated and care resumed by MH.
         5.2.4.5.1. MH staff will inform the member’s commander when a military member
         is released from inpatient care or partial hospitalization. This communication will be
         made directly to the commander to ensure clear communication at this time of
         heightened risk.
         5.2.4.5.2. MH staff will prepare a new outpatient safety plan based on the assessment
         conducted after the patient’s discharge.
         5.2.4.5.3. If the member declines this evaluation and there is an indication of
         elevated risk, an emergency CDE will be recommended to the commander to ensure
         adequate safety assessment of the member.
  5.2.5. Documentation.
     5.2.5.1. All intake notes in both the MH record and HR will document specific
     assessment of potential for harm to self and/or others and document level of risk. Where
     multiple members of the family are seen at intake, notes will document each individual's
     assessment for risk of maltreatment.
     5.2.5.2. MH records of HI patients will be identified with a yellow-colored cover sheet
     labeled ―High Interest‖ on the top of Section F until the patient is removed from HI
     status.
     5.2.5.3. A statement indicating a patient’s HI status will be placed in the HR to facilitate
     awareness by allied health providers of risk status. The first sentence of the subjective
     elements will state in capital letters ―HIGH INTEREST‖.
  5.2.6. Clinical Management of Suicidal Patients. MHPs will:
     5.2.6.1. Specifically target suicidal symptoms and risk factors in the formal outpatient
     treatment plan.
     5.2.6.2. Take steps to safeguard the environment, especially limiting access to means of
     self-harm such as weapons.
     5.2.6.3. Strongly consider using written screening tools. Discrepancies between what
     patients state verbally versus written statements will be reconciled. The MHP must have
     a clear understanding of any conflicting information that suggests risk for suicide.
AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011                                                                        25


     5.2.6.4. Use management strategies that are uniquely applicable to military members
     such as the Limited Privilege Suicide Prevention (LPSP) program, profiles, MEBs,
     administrative separation recommendations and communication with commanders.
     5.2.6.5. Enter patients who are psychiatrically hospitalized for suicide risk or attempted
     suicide into the HIL for at least four weeks following discharge or the attempt, whichever
     is later.
     5.2.6.6. Carefully evaluate every Airman with a recent suicide attempt for both ongoing
     care and fitness/suitability for continued duty. Following any military member suicide
     attempt, the MTF SGH will lead a meeting to review the case and determine the medical
     disposition of the individual. This meeting must include at least one MHP. An Airman
     with a potentially medically disqualifying diagnosis will meet an MEB. Those with a
     potential personality disorder or other unsuitable condition will be referred to his/her
     commander with a recommendation for a CDE. Notify HQ AFR/SGP at Robins AFB,
     GA about all suicide attempts by AFR personnel to ensure proper disposition.
     5.2.6.7. Initiate a fitness for duty determination for suicide attempts by ARC members.
     5.2.6.8. MH personnel will accomplish DoD Suicide Event Report (DoDSER) for all
     completed suicides and suicide attempts requiring hospitalization or evacuation from
     theater of military members.
     5.2.6.9. As clinically appropriate, work with patients to use community support
     resources to complement MH treatment (e.g., friends, family, unit, Airman and Family
     Readiness Center, Chapel, Health and Wellness Center, Alcoholics Anonymous,
     community based support groups, etc.) in managing suicidal behavior.
  5.2.7. Cancellations.
     5.2.7.1. If a HI patient calls to cancel an appointment, the MH staff will obtain the
     number where the patient is calling from and transfer the patient’s call directly to the
     PMHP.
     5.2.7.2. If the PMHP is unavailable, the MH staff will contact the on-call provider or
     other available MHP.
     5.2.7.3. The PMHP will speak directly with the HI patient. The unit commander will be
     informed immediately if the patient refuses follow up. A course of action will be
     recommended to the commander by the PMHP based on the patient’s individual needs.
  5.2.8. Failure to keep scheduled appointments ("no shows").
     5.2.8.1. If the HI patient no shows, the MH staff will contact the PMHP immediately.
     5.2.8.2. If the PMHP is unavailable, the MH staff will contact the on-call provider or
     other available MHP.
     5.2.8.3. HI patients will be rescheduled immediately in the event of a no show for a
     scheduled appointment.
     5.2.8.4. The unit commander will be informed immediately if contact cannot be
     established within one hour or the patient refuses follow up.
 26                                                               AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011


      5.2.8.5. All attempts to contact the patient and contacts with commanders and first
      sergeants will be documented in the MH record, Section F.
5.3. Multi-Disciplinary Case Management (MCM).
   5.3.1. MCM coordinates the care of patients who may be involved in multiple elements
   within MH. These cases are usually complex or involve administrative or legal action (but
   do not warrant HI status).
   5.3.2. An MCM log will be maintained to facilitate clinical case coordination and
   consultation.
   5.3.3. Cases on the MCM log will be discussed weekly at the MCCC.
   5.3.4. Sufficient information necessary to coordinate care and manage risk will be shared
   with all MH clinic personnel and documentation of this coordination/case discussion will be
   placed in the MH record.
   5.3.5. MCM log will not be shared outside MH. However, clinical coordination of care with
   other allied health care providers will occur as needed.
5.4. Transferring MH Records and Coordination of Care at the Time of Permanent
Change of Station (PCS).
   5.4.1. All patients will be briefed on the possible need for transfer of information upon PCS
   as part of the initial orientation to the MH Clinic, ADAPT Program, or FAP. This briefing
   will be provided verbally, documented in the clinic record, and will also be incorporated as
   part of the initial confidentiality/consent to treatment paperwork reviewed and signed by the
   patient (see Attachment 4).
   5.4.2. The MH Flight will obtain, from the MPF, a monthly listing of individuals identified
   for PCS departure. MH Flight staff will check clinic files for records of transferring
   personnel. When clinic records are identified, each case will be reviewed to determine
   appropriate action as outlined below.
      5.4.2.1. For AD patients consent to transfer MH record/care is not required. However,
      every effort shall be made to involve AD patients in the process.
      5.4.2.2. For non-AD patients actively involved in treatment at the time of PCS, the
      provider will discuss any need to transfer care/records. However, transfer cannot be
      accomplished without written consent. Closed records on non-AD patients are also
      reviewed prior to PCS. If the reviewing provider has concerns about elevated risk, the
      provider may contact the patient for a status check and determination of any need to
      transfer the record. Again, this transfer cannot be accomplished without the individual’s
      written consent.
   5.4.3. Open Cases. For all open MH Flight cases, the provider will review the case to
   determine if the record should be closed or if the patient’s care should be transferred to a MH
   Flight at patient’s new duty station. The decision to close a case will be based on clinical
   indications and not simply due to a move or for administrative convenience. The MHP will
   document the decision to close a case with a termination note in the MH record and the
   outpatient medical record. See Attachments 5 and 6. If the MHP makes the determination
AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011                                                                          27


  that the case should remain open, the MHP will contact the patient to discuss the
  recommendation for continuing care at the patient’s new duty station.
     5.4.3.1. For cases requiring transfer, the MHP shall contact a privileged MHP at the
     gaining base, communicating patient status and needs in transition, as well as establishing
     an appointment for follow-up to ensure continuity of care. Prior to departing for the new
     duty station, the patient will be informed of the transfer of information and shall be given
     the name of a MHP at the gaining base, contact information and an appointment.
         5.4.3.1.1. Prior to the patient’s PCS, the MHP at the losing base will also complete
         and forward to the gaining MHP a summary of treatment outlining the basis for initial
         contact, identified problems, diagnostic assessment, risk assessment, treatment plan
         (including medications and therapeutic interventions), progress in relation to
         identified goals, referrals (if any), and status at the time of transfer, see Attachment 5,
         Sample Mental Health Record Transfer/Termination Summary. An abbreviated
         version of this summary will be placed in the outpatient medical record, see
         Attachment 6, Sample Outpatient Medical Record Transfer/Termination Summary.
         Document both summaries on a SF Form 600.
         5.4.3.1.2. The contact with gaining MHP and the patient, the provision of contact
         information and the transfer of information will be documented in both the MH
         record and the outpatient medical record.
         5.4.3.1.3. In the event a patient fails to appear for the scheduled appointment at the
         gaining base, the identified MHP at the gaining base will follow up to determine the
         cause and to reschedule, if appropriate. If the patient is diverted in route, the provider
         scheduled to deliver follow-on services will notify the referring MHP at the losing
         base. MH personnel at the losing base retain responsibility for coordinating follow-
         on services if the patient is diverted in route. Communicating the minimum amount
         necessary, the MHP at the losing base will work with the MPF in tracking the patient
         and, once the new base of assignment has been determined, will contact the
         appropriate MH Flight to provide necessary information and ensure appropriate
         follow up.
     5.4.3.2. If the patient refuses to continue treatment and/or to schedule a follow-up
     appointment as recommended by the MHP, the provider should document the encounter
     and the decision by the patient to refuse services. The MHP should complete a summary
     of treatment for the MH record (see Attachment 5) and for the medical record (see
     Attachment 6).
         5.4.3.2.1. If, in the provider’s judgment, the failure to transfer care will result in risk
         to the patient, others, or the military mission, the MHP will contact the patient’s
         commander and communicate concerns regarding increased risk.
     5.4.3.3. Patients involved in required treatment as part of the FAP and/or ADAPT will
     have their cases transferred to their new duty stations to continue treatment.
  5.4.4. Closed Cases. The decision to close a case will be based on clinical indications and
  not simply due to a move or for administrative convenience. The MHP will document the
  decision to close a case with a termination note in the MH record and the outpatient medical
  record. See Attachments 5 and 6.
 28                                                             AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011


      5.4.4.1. All closed cases of AD members will be reviewed to assess risk of adverse
      mission impact. Particular attention should be given to review of cases involving a
      diagnosis of substance dependence, substantiated (but closed as unresolved) cases of
      family maltreatment, or previous suicide attempt. Reviewing providers will apply
      operational and clinical judgment in assessing risk of adverse mission impact, basing
      their assessment on their understanding of the member, the member’s potential response
      to pressures associated with PCS, and the demands likely to be encountered in the new
      working and living environment. When a reviewing MHP cannot adequately assess the
      stressors likely to be encountered in a new working or living environment, the MHP
      should query his/her counterpart at the gaining base in order to determine appropriate
      action. If it is determined the risk of adverse mission impact warrants MH intervention,
      the provider at the losing base will follow the same procedures noted above for
      transferring open cases.
   5.4.5. During the review of either open or closed cases, if the current risk for adverse
   mission impact is deemed severe enough to warrant a potential cancellation of PCS, the MHP
   will notify the member and his/her current Commander.
   5.4.6. The MHP at the gaining base may request a copy of the MH record from the losing
   base.
   5.4.7. Release of information to the gaining command will be based on the gaining
   provider’s assessment of the risk of adverse mission impact. Release of MH information to
   command shall occur IAW AFI 44-109. Disclosures to command authorities will be tracked
   IAW DoD 6025.18-R and AFI 41-210.
5.5. Other Continuity of Care Procedures.
   5.5.1. The MH Flight must notify the referring provider whenever a referred patient fails to
   keep their initial MH appointment.
   5.5.2. Continuity of Care - Civilian Facility or provider.
      5.5.2.1. Military patients referred for civilian MH care by an MHP will have a follow-up
      appointment with an MHP in order to facilitate continuity of care, and will be tracked at
      least quarterly to document duty and readiness fitness.
      5.5.2.2. Military patients referred for civilian MH care by a non-MH MTF provider will
      be tracked by their MTF PCM at least quarterly to document duty and readiness fitness.
   5.5.3. Commanders will notify MH staff if they become aware of a military member being
   seen off-base for emergent MH services. Likewise, MH staff will notify commanders when a
   military member is seen for emergent MH services (see paragraph 5.9) in order to facilitate
   appropriate safety and operational planning.
5.6. Management of Patients in Crisis (during duty and after-duty hours).
   5.6.1. During duty hours, an MHP will be available to conduct emergency evaluations and
   consultation to base personnel. If services cannot be delivered in MH by close of business,
   arrangements will be made for the patient to be seen at an emergency medical facility per
   established MTF procedures. In some cases, the MHP may determine that the need for
   services is not acute and may arrange for the patient to be seen later in MH.
AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011                                                                        29


     5.6.1.1. In an outpatient setting, MH assessments will only be performed during regular
     duty hours when both security and medical support are available. MH evaluations will
     not be performed at such places as the duty section, residence or public venues. Mass-
     casualty procedures may take precedence when indicated by Medical Command Centers.
     5.6.1.2. After-hours MH assessments will only be conducted in an ED. In MTFs without
     an ED, these emergencies will be handled similar to other acute medical emergencies
     using community medical resources. MH assessments may be performed at any time in
     MTFs where a 24-hour ED is in operation.
     5.6.1.3. If an emergent evaluation is conducted at MH, the requesting commander will
     provide an escort for the patient.
     5.6.1.4. Transportation of patients. The unit commander is responsible for taking
     precautions to ensure the safety of the service member and others and for making
     arrangements for transportation to an emergency evaluation. Transportation of
     emergency MH patients will occur in a manner similar to other acute medical
     emergencies. Escort policies will not task MH personnel with accompanying MH
     patients in ambulances or Government Owned Vehicles (GOV)/Privately Owned
     Vehicles (POV). The exception is use of MH technicians to aid in air evacuation of
     certain categories of MH patients on military airlift.
     5.6.1.5. Appointments extending beyond duty hours may increase risk. MH staff will
     ensure there is adequate staffing to minimize or respond to these risks.
     5.6.1.6. MH will establish after-hours consultation procedures for commanders or other
     medical resources.
         5.6.1.6.1. If initial consultation is provided by an intern or resident provider in an AF
         residency/internship training program, a privileged MHP will be available to provide
         appropriate supervision.
         5.6.1.6.2. If the initial consultation is provided by MH technicians, and involves
         patient assessment, then in all cases a privileged MHP will provide eyes on
         supervision. If the consultation is to command, then a privileged MHP will be
         available to provide supervision to the technician as indicated.
  5.6.2. On intake for evaluation, mental health staff shall ask whether the member is there
  voluntarily or at the direction of his or her commander/supervisor. If the member responds
  with the latter and the commander has not initiated a commander-directed mental health
  evaluation (CDE) IAW DoDD 6490.1 and DoDI 6490.4 and AFI 44-109, the MHP shall
  contact the commander to determine if a CDE was intended.
  5.6.3. Fitness and Suitability for Duty Determinations.
     5.6.3.1. All military personnel must be fit and suitable for their assigned duty, both
     physically and psychologically. Personnel must be able to perform job-related duties,
     accomplish mission tasks and tolerate environmental stressors.
     5.6.3.2. Certain duty statuses, such as PRP/PSP, weapons bearing status, security
     clearances and/or flight status, have specific requirements for medical fitness and
     suitability. MH will advise Flight Medicine anytime a patient on flight status is seen.
     Flight Medicine will clear the member prior to resuming flight duties (AFI 48-123,
 30                                                               AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011


      Medical Examinations and Standards). Notifications are also required for Remotely
      Piloted Aircraft (RPA) crewmembers, air traffic controllers, weapons
      controllers/directors, combat controllers and Aerospace Control and Warning Systems,
      Tactical Air Control Party and Air Liaison Officer.
      5.6.3.3. MHPs will determine whether personnel with MH disorders are fit and suitable
      for duty. Any condition resulting in impairment could render the member unfit or
      unsuitable for duty and preclude deployment (Note: ANG DPHs are not permitted to
      perform fitness for duty evaluations).
      5.6.3.4. Conditions that result in persistent or recurrent duty impairment, preclude
      deployment, or require continuing treatment for adequate functioning may require an
      MEB or administrative separation.
      5.6.3.5. Factors influencing determinations of fitness and deployability for patients with
      MH disorders include:
          5.6.3.5.1. Severity of symptoms or medication side effects.
          5.6.3.5.2. Likelihood of relapse.
          5.6.3.5.3. Risk of recurrence or exacerbation if exposed to operational stress or
          trauma.
          5.6.3.5.4. Severity of functional impairment.
          5.6.3.5.5. The provider’s estimation of the member’s ability to tolerate the rigors of
          austere or hostile environments.
          5.6.3.5.6. Risk for deterioration, early return, or other adverse outcomes.
5.7. Commander-Directed Evaluations (CDE) Procedures.
   5.7.1. CDEs will be conducted IAW Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 6490.1,
   Mental Health Evaluations of Members of the Armed Forces; Department of Defense
   Instruction (DoDI) 6490.4, Requirements for Mental Health Evaluations of Members of the
   Armed Forces; AFI 44-109 and this instruction.
   5.7.2. Commanders on G-series orders may request a CDE for a variety of concerns
   including fitness for duty, safety concerns, or significant changes in performance or mental
   state. CDEs will be initiated any time a commander is seeking feedback on a member from
   MHPs. Only commanders can order a CDE.
   5.7.3. MHPs will discuss the reason for the request with the commander. They will
   document this and all subsequent discussions with the commander. MHPs will also
   document the rationale for their recommendations to the commander regarding the
   appropriateness of a CDE versus other options.
   5.7.4. To ensure that DoD and AF guidance regarding CDEs are followed, MH will use a
   CDE checklist (see Attachment 7).
   5.7.5. The assigned MHP will determine the appropriateness of the requested CDE based on
   whether it will assist the commander in answering specific duty-related questions. The MHP
   will also determine whether the CDE is being requested properly IAW DoDD 6490.1, DoDI
   6490.4 and AFI 44-109.
AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011                                                                    31


  5.7.6. The basis of a CDE request is observed behaviors that may indicate that the member
  has an impaired mental state or functioning based on a mental condition.
  5.7.7. Before the initial appointment, MHPs will obtain the proper CDE documentation IAW
  DoD and AFIs. They will ensure that the commander followed the proper process for
  initiating the CDE. On intake for evaluation, MH staff shall ensure the member understands
  they are being evaluated at the direction of the commander.
  5.7.8. At the start of the initial appointment, the MHP will review the legal requirements,
  process, limits of confidentiality and potential career impact of the CDE with the member.
  5.7.9. Information to be reviewed by the MHP as part of the CDE will usually include:
     5.7.9.1. A form to be completed by the member’s commander, first sergeant and/or
     supervisor regarding the member’s duty performance, recent changes in performance or
     behavior, as well as data such as time on station and administrative actions taken by the
     unit to remediate behavior.
     5.7.9.2. Copies of the member’s recent performance reports and Personnel Information
     File.
     5.7.9.3. Psychological testing if administered. When a personality disorder is suspected,
     psychological testing is strongly recommended.
     5.7.9.4. Collateral interviews with supervisors and with appropriate consent, coworkers,
     family members and friends, as appropriate.
     5.7.9.5. Previous medical and MH records.
     5.7.9.6. Laboratory and radiological studies as appropriate.
  5.7.10. The MHP will complete a formal written response to the commander within one duty
  day following completion of the CDE. Reports will be consistent with the template found in
  DoDI 6490.4, Enclosure 5.
  5.7.11. Emergency CDEs.
     5.7.11.1. Emergency CDEs are conducted to assess imminent safety concerns (i.e.,
     danger to self or others). All other questions from commanders will be handled through
     the routine CDE process. MHPs will ensure that an emergency CDE is warranted and the
     commander is aware of the limitations of an emergency CDE.
     5.7.11.2. MHPs will consult with the commander to maximize the safety of the member
     during the referral process.
     5.7.11.3. MHPs will ensure the member understands the reason for the referral, the
     process of the emergency CDE and the limits of confidentiality. MHPs will clearly
     differentiate between emergency CDEs, which are not voluntary and voluntary treatment
     of members who have presented to MH at the suggestion/encouragement of their
     command. MHPs will ensure voluntary treatment at the suggestion/encouragement of
     command is not coercive in nature.
     5.7.11.4. All emergency CDEs will be accomplished IAW DoDI 6490.4 and AFI 44-109.
     Verbal feedback will be provided to the referring commander as soon as possible after the
     evaluation (within 24 hours). A written report will be completed within one duty day.
 32                                                               AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011


5.8. Limited Privilege Suicide Prevention (LPSP) Program.
   5.8.1. The objective of LPSP is to identify and treat those AF members, who because of the
   stress of impending disciplinary action under the UCMJ, pose a genuine threat of suicide
   (AFI 44-109).
   5.8.2. MHPs should clarify the potential benefits and limitations of confidentiality provided
   by this program for at-risk patients who are under investigation.
   5.8.3. MHPs should attempt to have at risk patients enrolled in this program IAW AFI 44-
   109.
5.9. Duty Limiting Conditions (DLC).
   5.9.1. An AF Form 469, Duty Limiting Conditions Report, will be initiated by a privileged
   MHP when a patient’s MH condition impairs his or her ability to deploy or perform military
   duties, or whenever a patient’s military duties impair his or her ability to recover from a
   mental illness or condition.
   5.9.2. DLC status will be addressed at each patient appointment and annotated on all
   progress notes. Any change in status must be accompanied by justification and rationale.
   5.9.3. Members with diagnosed conditions that are not amenable to treatment and restoration
   to full functioning within one year of onset of treatment will generally be considered unfit or
   unsuitable for military duty and the patient will be referred for an MEB or recommended for
   administrative separation.
   5.9.4. Privileged providers who conduct military medical readiness assessments for
   individuals with psychiatric disorders must consider the following criteria. These criteria
   will be applied across each assessment event in the military medical readiness life-cycle
   (periodic health assessment, pre-and post-deployment assessment and reassessments).
      5.9.4.1. All patients with conditions that do not meet retention requirements or that
      render an individual unfit or unsuitable for military duty will be referred through
      appropriate fitness for duty or administrative processes.
      5.9.4.2. Psychotic and Bipolar Disorders are considered disqualifying for deployment.
      5.9.4.3. Members with a psychiatric disorder in remission or whose residual symptoms
      do not impair duty performance may be considered for deployment duties.
      5.9.4.4. Members with psychiatric disorders not meeting the threshold for an MEB will
      demonstrate a pattern of stability without significant symptoms for at least three months
      prior to deployment.
      5.9.4.5. The availability, accessibility and practicality of treatment in theater must be
      considered in clearing members for deployment.
      5.9.4.6. Members cleared to deploy will demonstrate behavioral stability and low
      potential for deterioration or recurrence of symptoms in a deployed environment. The
      environmental conditions and mission demands of deployment will be considered [e.g.,
      impact of sleep deprivation, rotating schedules, fatigue due to longer working hours and
      increased physical challenges (including heat stress) with regard to a given MH
      condition].
AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011                                                                        33


     5.9.4.7. The occupational specialty in which the individual will function in a deployed
     environment will be considered; however, deployed individuals may be called upon to
     function outside their military training as well as outside their initially assigned deployed
     occupation specialties. The primary consideration must be the overall environmental
     conditions and mission demands of the deployed environment rather than a singular focus
     on anticipated occupation-specific demands.
  5.9.5. Medications prescribed to treat psychiatric disorders vary in terms of their effects on
  cognition, judgment, decision making, reaction time, psychomotor functioning and
  coordination. Caution is warranted in beginning, changing, stopping and/or continuing
  psychotropic medication for deploying and deployed personnel. Throughout the medical
  readiness lifecycle, medication will be evaluated for potential limitations to deployment or
  continued service in a deployed environment.
  5.9.6. Few medications are inherently disqualifying for deployment for all military
  occupational specialties, at all potential operational locations and at all times during the
  conduct of operations. Clinical care proximity, procedures availability, tempo and demands
  of operations must be considered when determining use of psychotropic medications prior to
  deployment as well as in the operational environment.
     5.9.6.1. Medications disqualifying for deployment include:
         5.9.6.1.1. Antipsychotics, lithium and anticonvulsants.
         5.9.6.1.2. Medications that require special storage considerations such as
         refrigeration.
         5.9.6.1.3. Medications that require laboratory monitoring or special assessments,
         including lithium, anticonvulsants and antipsychotics.
         5.9.6.1.4. Providers are required to initiate a DLC or medical profile when managing
         care involving the disqualifying medications listed in paragraph 5.9.6.1.
     5.9.6.2. Potentially problematic psychotropics during deployments include short half-life
     benzodiazepines and stimulants. Consider potential for withdrawal symptoms, ability to
     secure and procure medications and potential for medication abuse when determining
     appropriateness for use by deploying personnel.
     5.9.6.3. Providers should exercise clinical judgment regarding initiation of a DLC or
     medical profile, utilizing operational risk management principles, when managing other
     clinical situations or medications that can be potentially disqualifying for deployment.
     Provider clinical rationale utilized in making the determination regarding duty limitations
     should be clearly documented in the MH and HR notes.
     5.9.6.4. A deployment waiver is required where less than 90 days of stability has been
     demonstrated in the following situations: Personnel who are newly diagnosed with an
     MH condition, personnel who receive a new prescription of a psychotropic medication, or
     personnel whose prescription for psychotropic medication has recently changed. Waivers
     will be considered for treatment scenarios that have clear evidence of clinical stability
     with minimal likelihood of de-compensation in a deployed setting and have been shown
     to be both effective and free of impairing side effects.
 34                                                                AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011


       5.9.6.5. The combatant command overseeing the theater of operations may issue
       additional restrictions/guidance for deploying personnel.
5.10. Confidentiality.
   5.10.1. Confidentiality is essential to providing effective MH care. While MHPs have an
   obligation to make notifications to commanders in specific situations, they will operate from
   a presumption of non-notification. MHPs will presume that they are not to notify a
   member’s commander when a member obtains MH services in MH, primary care facility, or
   other setting where such services are provided. This presumption is overcome by the
   following situations which require command notification:
       5.10.1.1. Harm to Self. The provider believes there is a serious risk of self-harm by the
       member.
       5.10.1.2. Harm to Others. The provider believes there is a serious risk of harm to others.
       This includes any disclosures concerning child abuse or domestic violence.
       5.10.1.3. Harm to Mission. The provider believes there is a serious risk of harm to a
       specific military operational mission to include cognitive deficits that could result in
       inadequate judgment.
       5.10.1.4. Special Personnel. The member is in the PRP/PSP or is in a position that has
       been pre-identified by Service regulation or the command as having mission
       responsibilities of such potential sensitivity or urgency that normal notification standards
       would significantly risk mission accomplishment IAW DoDI 5210.42, Nuclear Weapon
       Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) and AFMAN 10-3902.
       5.10.1.5. Acute Medical Conditions Interfering With Duty. The member is experiencing
       an acute MH condition or acute medical regimen that impairs his or her ability to perform
       his or her duties.
       5.10.1.6. Substance Abuse Treatment Program. The member has entered into a formal
       outpatient or inpatient treatment program consistent with DoDI 1010.6, Rehabilitation
       and Referral Services for Alcohol and Drug Abusers, [Reference (f)] and AFI 44-121 for
       the treatment of substance abuse or dependence. Those who seek alcohol-use education
       who have not had an alcohol related incident (such as arrest for driving under the
       influence) do not require command notification unless they are diagnosed with a
       substance abuse or dependence disorder.
       5.10.1.7. Child or Partner Maltreatment. A referral will be made immediately to FAP.
       As part of the FAP notification process, FAP will notify the military member’s
       commander, unless the adult victim has requested and met the conditions for a restricted
       report of domestic abuse IAW AFI 40-301.
       5.10.1.8. Sexual Assault Victims. Follow restricted reporting guidance provided in
       DoDI 6495.02 Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program Procedures and AFI
       36-6001, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Program.
       5.10.1.9. CDE. Information obtained as a result of a CDE consistent with DoDI 6490.4
       and this instruction.
AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011                                                                         35


      5.10.1.10. Other special circumstances. The notification is based on other special
      circumstances in which proper execution of the military mission outweighs the interests
      served by avoiding notification as determined by the SGH or MTF commander at the O-6
      level or above.
      5.10.1.11. Other medical personnel will also follow these disclosure rules regarding MH
      information.
   5.10.2. Minimum Necessary Disclosure. In making a disclosure pursuant to the notification
   standards, health care providers will provide the minimum amount of information to satisfy
   the purpose of the disclosure. In general, this will consist of the diagnosis, a description of
   the treatment prescribed or planned, recommended duty restrictions and the prognosis.
5.11. Quality Management and Process Improvement.
   5.11.1. MH staff will remain vigilant for processes that can be improved or new programs
   that could be implemented to support the flight’s overall mission. Those activities that are
   high volume, involve HI patients, or are problem-prone are prime targets for process
   improvement.
   5.11.2. MH staff will utilize a variety of data to identify processes requiring improvement
   and to develop solutions, including (but not limited to) self inspection checklists, peer review
   data, record audits, clinical data, customer feedback, the flight monthly status report and
   electronic medical record.
5.12. Peer Review.
   5.12.1. MHPs will have peer review monthly. Ideally, peer review will be accomplished by
   a fully privileged provider within the same profession. If a provider of the same profession is
   not available at the installation, a fully privileged provider from the MH clinic will perform
   the monthly peer review within the scope of their clinical privileges to ensure compliance
   with AF unique standards of care. Additionally, arrangements will be made for same
   profession peer review at least quarterly.
   5.12.2. All cases on the HIL will be peer reviewed monthly.
   5.12.3. A minimum of three patient cases seen in the last 30 days must be reviewed per
   provider per month. If the provider did not see three patients or three records are not
   available, then all available records will be reviewed. HI records reviewed IAW the previous
   paragraph count towards this requirement.
   5.12.4. Peer review will evaluate the quality of the assessment, mental status exam,
   diagnostic conclusions, clinical decision-making, risk assessment, treatment planning,
   documentation, legibility and organization of the record.
   5.12.5. The reviewing provider will annotate any identified discrepancies or concerns on a
   standardized peer review form. The reviewing provider will advise the treating provider of
   the identified discrepancies for peer support and process improvement.
   5.12.6. Correctable documentation errors will be corrected by the provider being reviewed
   IAW section 4.3.7.
 36                                                               AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011


                                           Chapter 6

                                       CLEARANCES

6.1. Family Member Relocation Clearances (FMRCs).
   6.1.1. MH supports the FMRC process as a clinical consultant where MH or substance abuse
   issues are identified, IAW AFI 40-701, Special Needs Identification and Assignment
   Coordination. MHPs advise as needed on either outbound or inbound Facility Determination
   Inquiries (FDIs). The FAO or designee supports the FMRC process where FAP services are
   identified.
   6.1.2. When MH identifies conditions that meet criteria for Exceptional Family Member
   Program (EFMP) enrollment, MH supports the functions of EFMP enrollment through
   mandatory referral to the EFMP Medical (EFMP-M) office, IAW AFI 36-2110, Assignments,
   Attachment 25, and AFI 40-701.
   6.1.3. MHPs ensure the delivery of needed documentation to the Special Needs Coordinator
   (SNC) upon request for outbound FDIs regarding MH or substance abuse services obtained
   by family members in the MTF, or regarding those family members known to the providers
   of the MTF as requiring special services. MHPs complete the DD 2792, Exceptional Family
   Member Medical Summary, upon request of the SNC to support outbound FDIs or for EFMP
   enrollment.
   6.1.4. MHPs provide consultation to the SNC or SGH upon request for outgoing FDIs
   regarding information gained during the interview, medical records review or electronic data
   review (such as medication histories) in order to support thorough documentation of MH
   needs in family members.
   6.1.5. MHPs review incoming FDIs in locations where MTF MH/substance abuse services
   are provided to family members and make recommendations regarding service availability.
   MHPs provide consultation to the SNC and/or SGH as needed regarding whether host nation
   or local network capabilities meet MH needs specified on incoming FDIs.
6.2. Family Child Care Applications.
   6.2.1. AFI 34-276, Family Child Care Programs requires MH, FAP and ADAPT to assist
   the Family Child Care panel in their decisions on licensure for day care providers.
   6.2.2. MH will develop procedures for record search/review for Family Child Care
   applicants. Applications may be reviewed by a 5-level or higher MH technician. If no
   Potentially Disqualifying Information (PDI) is found, then the technician can sign the form.
   If PDI is noted, the application will be referred to a privileged MHP for review/approval.
   6.2.3. A signed release will be provided by the applicant prior to record review.
6.3. Deployment MH.
   6.3.1. All members’ MH records will be screened by MH prior to deployment.
   6.3.2. Members will receive an appropriate pre-deployment briefing prior to deployment to a
   combat zone in IAW AFI 44-153.
AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011                                                                       37


   6.3.3. A person-to-person MH assessment will be conducted with a medical provider within
   60 days of deployment.
   6.3.4. All members deploying for 30 days or more to an imminent danger pay area will
   receive a predeployment neurocognitive baseline assessment utilizing the Automated
   Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM) within 12 months prior to deployment. If
   the deployer has received a baseline within the previous 12 months and is deploying for a
   second time, no additional testing is required. At each base, MH will have at least one
   trained test proctor to schedule, administer and manage the data from ANAM.
   6.3.5. Members returning from deployment will complete a Post Deployment Health
   Assessment (PDHA) questionnaire. PCMs will evaluate and refer members as appropriate
   based on their PDHA responses.
   6.3.6. All redeployed members will receive a post-deployment briefing in conjunction with
   the installation redeployment support process IAW AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and
   Execution and Chapter 8, Redeployment Support Process.
   6.3.7. Post deployers will have a person-to-person MH assessment with a medical provider
   between 90-180 days after return from deployment, not later than 12 months after return
   from deployment and 24 months after return from deployment.
6.4. Special Clearances. MH staff may be required to assist in clearances for special duties
[such as MTI/MTL, Survival Evasion Resistance Escape (SERE), Sniper school, recruiting duty,
etc.]. They will ensure there is a signed consent for the release of confidential information and
comply with the requirements outlined in the clearance request. Requests for clearances are not
considered MH evaluations, but a clinical note will be placed in the electronic medical record
and a copy of the documents kept in a clearance file.
6.5. Personnel Reliability Program (PRP)/Presidential Support Program (PSP).
   6.5.1. PRP/PSP determinations require a comprehensive assessment of behaviors (both on-
   and off- duty), history, reliability, cognitive abilities and emotional stability.
   6.5.2. For personnel being certified, recertified or otherwise evaluated for PRP/PSP, all HR
   SF Form 600s must be reviewed in order to determine if PDI exists (e.g., FAP, MH, ADAPT,
   relevant medical problems, MH issues treated by a PCM). Ensure ED documentation and
   Personal Health Assessments (PHAs) documentation are thoroughly reviewed. In addition,
   review Part III of the SF Form 93, Report of Medical History, as well as DD Forms 2807-1,
   Report of Medical History and 2807-2, Medical Prescreen of Report of Medical History
   (reports of medical history) in order to screen for responses made of prior-to-service
   behaviors or events that indicate discrepancies or potential disqualification, such as
   marijuana use, drug/alcohol rehabilitation, loss of consciousness, dizziness/fainting spells,
   significant head injury, previous MH problems, hospitalizations or treatment.
   6.5.3. Consult DoD 5210.42-R, Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) and
   AFMAN 10-3902 for more information on selection, evaluation, treatment and reporting of
   PRP/PSP personnel.

                              MH PREVENTION SERVICES

7.1. MH prevention strategies will: target individual and organizational risk factors and
increase resiliency in populations served. The RE has primary responsibility for these efforts,
but will coordinate with other MH elements.
7.2. Prevention services at the installation level are: a collaborative effort shared among
various agencies to include MH, MTF, CAIB and IDS. The IDS will be the focal point for the
development and implementation of programs geared towards increasing organizational and
individual awareness of MH issues, trends and threats to mission readiness.
7.3. Prevention services for FAP/ADAPT/DDR/TSR and Suicide Prevention are: outlined
in their respective AFI’s (AFI 40-301; AFI 44-121; AFI 44-153; AFI 44-154, Suicide and
Violence Prevention Education and Training; AFI 44-120, Drug Abuse Testing Program).
7.4. MH will: provide briefings to the installation and community as requested.
AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011                                                                        39


                                           Chapter 8

                                 MISCELLANEOUS ROLES

8.1. Forensic Consultation. MHPs may consult regarding forensic MH issues, conduct
forensic evaluations of military members and testify as expert consultants in military courts-
martial. MHPs will not accept forensic cases in which they have previously evaluated the
lawyer’s client in any ordinary clinical context. MHPs may consult with a patient’s defense
attorney when the patient authorizes disclosure in writing; however, providers should be aware
of potential negative impact on provider-patient relationship resulting from compelled disclosure
or testimony from prosecution discovery.
8.2. TSR/Combat Stress Control. The TSR team chief is a MHP appointed by the installation
commander. The primary function of the team is to consult with unit leaders and provide initial
response when groups or individuals expect to be or have been exposed to potentially traumatic
stress. The primary goal of TSR teams is to foster resiliency through education, screening,
psychological first aid and referral in those exposed to traumatic stress. Refer to AFI 44-153 for
more information.
8.3. Behavioral Health Optimization Program (BHOP) Services.
   8.3.1. MHPs providing BHOP services will be trained in the AF BHOP model either via
   internship or externship training IAW the BHOP Manual (https://kx.afms.mil/bhop).
   8.3.2. MHPs working in BHOP will function in the role of a Behavioral Health Consultant
   (BHC) to the PCM team to address the psychosocial aspects of the patient’s overall health.
       8.3.2.1. Patients seen by the BHC are referred by their PCM or PCM team for this
       specific service. In cases in which patients self-refer or are referred to the BHC by
       sources other than the PCM, such as PDHRA assessment or other screening, the BHC
       will report back to the PCM to ensure the PCM is aware that the patient is being seen by
       the BHC. In all cases, the PCM retains primary responsibility for the patient’s overall
       health and treatment.
       8.3.2.2. Services provided by the BHC include assessment, brief intervention and
       psycho-education. Collaborative consultation with the PCM team, BHC and the patient
       ensure BHC interventions support the PCM’s treatment goals for the patient.
       8.3.2.3. Patients referred to the BHC are seen in the Primary Care clinic from which they
       are referred and the Primary Care clinic’s Mission Essential Performance Requirements
       (MEPR) code is utilized.
       8.3.2.4. BHC functions as a consultant to the PCM team. The BHC ensures
       documentation of the patient’s visit is available to the PCM via the electronic medical
       record and that verbal feedback is also provided to the PCM whenever possible.
       8.3.2.5. When or if the need for prolonged or more intensive MH care arises, the BHC
       coordinates referral for specialty MH services.
       8.3.2.6. Peer review for the BHC is conducted by another MHP (i.e., psychologist, social
       worker or psychiatrist), preferably one that has also been trained in the AF BHOP model.
 40                                                            AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011


8.4. Clinical Hypnosis/Formal Sex Therapy. Refer to AFI 44-102, Medical Care
Management.
8.5. Biofeedback. MHPs may be granted privileges to administer biofeedback if they have been
certified by the Biofeedback Certification Institute of America or if they have met the AF
training requirements, which include having completed 20 hours of didactic instruction and 20
hours of supervised clinical treatment by an MHP privileged to perform biofeedback.
8.6. Prescribed and Adopted Forms.

 12-TARGETS TO ENHANCE RESILIENCE AND OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE

A2.1. Extended periods of high ops tempo or brief periods of intense operations can
degrade performance. If practiced regularly the behaviors and thoughts described below
enhance operational performance and resiliency in the midst of combat or operational stressors.
A2.2. Physical Fitness: Exercise not only improves strength and stamina, it enhances the
ability of the body and mind to function at peak performance level, and creates a sense of well-
being.
A2.3. Nutrition: Healthy foods and plenty of water together form the optimal fuel to ensure the
mind and body operate at peak performance. Eating well and staying hydrated are essential for
being at your best.
A2.4. Recharge: Take control of how you use your energy and include time for your body to
replenish before the next surge of energy use. Identify recreational activities you enjoy and
things that help you relax. Try to get 7 or 8 hours sleep every 24 hours if the mission permits.
Whenever possible, maintain a consistent sleep schedule and try to use the bed only for sleep.
A2.5. Strategic Thinking: You automatically evaluate every event in your life. Pay attention
to how you think about things and identify the good and the bad of each situation. Keep your
thoughts balanced and build confidence in yourself and your training by reminding yourself of
other challenges you have overcome and what you are learning through each circumstance.
A2.6. Situational Awareness (SA): Be aware of what is going on around you and remind
yourself of your role in the task or mission. By realistically assessing each situation and
leveraging your thoughts using your awareness of the situation and your training, you will
improve your performance under challenging situations.
A2.7. Problem-Solving: Effective problem-solving increases the probability of a good
solution. Follow these steps: 1. Specifically define the problem; 2. Set a realistic goal; 3.
Generate multiple solutions (don’t skip this part); 4. Compare the solutions, select one, and
implement; and 5. Evaluate the outcome and identify lessons learned.
A2.8. Purpose=Y: Keep your purpose and your role in the mission clear in your mind. Define
your Y (Why). Remind yourself of the reasons you were selected for or chose the job and the
value you can gain. Thinking about your contribution to the bigger mission can reground you to
a sense of purpose in life.
A2.9. Tactical Breathing: Stress and adrenaline can cause physical responses that erode
performance, but Tactical Breathing can bring you focus and attention. Control your breathing
by simply taking slow, deep breaths. Inhale and exhale slowly, releasing muscle tension as you
exhale and focus on the task at hand.
A2.10. Comm Check: Make sure you are receiving the information that the sender intended
and that your message has been received as you intended. Ask the person what they heard you
say. Do not respond until the receiver finishes retelling what you said. Clarify if your message
has been misunderstood.
AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011                                                                          47


A2.11. Mental Rehearsal: Images are powerful so use them to build your mental fitness by
practicing performance-building techniques. Practice a task or procedure in your mind by
visualizing yourself doing it well before you actually attempt it. Imagine a successful outcome.
A2.12. Be a Wingman: A Wingman cares for himself, others and AF families. Signs of
distress in others should not be dismissed and neither should senseless risks to life as a result of
improper safety and irresponsible behavior. Make responsible choices and help others do the
same.
A.13. Lead From the Front: Demonstrate good leadership by using these techniques yourself.
Talk about them and hold Airmen accountable. A leader facilitates positive group ―sense
making‖ of an experience, seeks out meaningful and challenging group tasks, communicates a
high level of respect and commitment to unit members and anticipates high-stress events

MEMORANDUM FOR Patients of the (base) Mental Health Clinic

FROM: xxth Medical Operations Squadron/(office symbol)
      (address)

SUBJECT: Patient's Information Sheet

1. Patients are often unsure what to expect in a Mental Health Clinic (MHC). We strongly
   encourage you to consider the following points regarding mental health care and to discuss
   them with your provider if you wish. You can expect the attention, respect, and best
   professional efforts of your provider. Your provider will expect you to take an active part in
   setting goals, deciding on treatment options and engaging in treatment. Talk to your provider
   if you have any questions about your care. Before your evaluation or treatment begins, we
   want you to understand how things work in the MHC. With the exception of Commander-
   Directed Evaluations, and non-self-referred ADAPT and FAP treatment, services at the MHC
   are provided strictly on a voluntary basis. If you feel that you have been improperly directed
   or pressured in any way to come to the clinic, please discuss this with your provider at the
   earliest possible time.

2. Records of Your Care. Every patient visit to the MHC is documented in the outpatient
   medical record so providers in other clinics caring for you are aware of your care here.
   These entries are as brief as possible to protect your privacy. Detailed notes documenting
   your mental health care are maintained in your mental health record. The mental health
   record is secured in the MHC. If you have questions/concerns about what information might
   be shared please discuss this with your provider.

3. Disclosure Policy for Active Duty (AD) and Non-Active Duty (non-AD) Patients. The
   privacy of non-AD patients is protected by the Federal Privacy Act and is not generally
   governed by other military regulations, unless the individual is also a Department of Defense
   employee. Most information related to the treatment of non-AD patients is not releasable
   without the written consent of the patient. Excluded from consent requirements are such
   activities as quality assurance reviews by other MHC professionals and collection of
   information for medical research. Other releases generally require your written consent.
   Exceptions for AD and non-AD include:

       Child or Spouse Maltreatment. Providers must report suspected child abuse or neglect,
       and other incidents of family maltreatment to military agencies, local child protective
       authorities, or both.

       Crimes or Fraud. Providers must report any threat to commit crimes or fraud by non-
       AD as well as AD clients. In many instances, military providers are also required to
AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011                                                                        51


     notify appropriate agencies when AD members report they have committed a crime or
     have been the victim of a crime.

     Danger to Self or Others. Providers must take steps to protect individuals from harm
     when a client presents a serious threat to the life or safety of self or others.

     High Interest Log (HIL). Any time a provider considers a patient to be a serious risk
     for harming themselves or others, the patient is placed on the MHC HIL. In order to
     better coordinate care and ensure safety, the cases of patients on the HIL are discussed at
     weekly MHC meetings and the names are shared with family practice providers and the
     xx MDG Emergency Department. This practice is in accordance with military and DoD
     policy. Your provider will inform you if/when you are placed on the HIL and when you
     are removed from it. Patients on the HIL will be required to speak with their provider for
     a brief status check when calling the clinic. If a patient on the HIL fails to arrive for a
     scheduled appointment, the provider will attempt to make phone contact. If the provider
     cannot locate or contact the patient within one hour, the provider may contact other
     persons or agents in order to ascertain the patient’s location and status in order to ensure
     their safety. Other persons or agents the provider might contact include, but is not
     limited to, the patient’s commander, first sergeant and Security Forces, as appropriate.
     Should a high risk patient decline to reschedule an appointment the member’s
     commander will be notified. Commanders of AD members must be informed when one
     of their personnel is placed on or removed from the HIL.

     Continuity of Care. Information may be released for purposes of official military
     processes such as a Medical Evaluation Boards or Commander Directed Evaluations.
     Information may also be shared between military and non-military providers in certain
     instances in order to facilitate medical care (e.g., when a patient is referred to a civilian
     provider or hospital).

     Coordination of Care at the Time of Permanent Change of Station (PCS) and
     Transfer of Information. The care/records of any AD member requiring ongoing
     treatment at the time of PCS will be transferred to the MHC at the gaining base for
     follow-up to ensure continuity of care. This transfer will be discussed with the AD
     member, but does not require the AD member’s consent. In cases of AD members who
     have terminated treatment, records are reviewed prior to PCS. If there are concerns, the
     member may be contacted by a provider for a status check, at which time the provider
     will make a determination if the record needs to be forwarded to the gaining base if
     follow-up is required in the future. For non-AD patients actively involved in treatment at
     the time of PCS, the provider will discuss any need to transfer care/records. However,
     transfer cannot be accomplished without written consent. Closed records on non-AD
     patients are also reviewed prior to PCS. If the reviewing provider has concerns about
     elevated risk, the provider may contact the patient for a status check and determination of
     any need to transfer the record. Again, this transfer cannot be accomplished without the
     individual’s consent.

       Exceptions for AD Only:

       Access to Records by Commanders. Though infrequent, Commanders may obtain
       information about a patient’s treatment at the MHC if that information is required to
       ensure fitness or suitability for duty or to ensure the accomplishment of a military
       mission. When information is released under this provision, the information will be
       limited to that required for the Commander to make decisions about fitness and readiness.

       Profiles/Duty Limiting Conditions. MHC providers will consult with commanders
       and/or first sergeants any time they feel a member has a condition or circumstance that
       makes them not fit for duty, deployable or requires any changes in their normal duties.

       Drug or Alcohol Abuse. Providers must report all suspected instances of drug/alcohol
       abuse by AD clients to rehabilitation programs (ADAPT) and commanders. Per AFI 44-
       121, an Air Force member may voluntarily disclose evidence of personal drug use or
       possession to the unit commander, first sergeant, substance abuse evaluator, or a military
       medical professional. Commanders will grant limited protection for Air Force members
       who reveal this information with the intention of entering treatment. Commanders may
       not use voluntary disclosure against a member in an action under the Uniform Code of
       Military Justice (UCMJ) or when weighing characterization of service in a separation.

4. Appointment Cancellations/No-Shows. We ask that you give us at least 24 hours notice if
   you will be unable to make an appointment you have scheduled so we may try to use that
   appointment for another person seeking assistance from our clinic. If you provide us with
   less than 24 hours notice we will designate the appointment as a ―no-show‖. Your provider
   may speak to you about whether continuing treatment makes sense if you have too many
   ―no-shows‖. If you do not reschedule at the time of cancellation, a staff member will contact
   you and offer a follow-up appointment.

5. Ancillary Staff/Trainees Involved in Patient Care. We operate the MHC under a team
   concept approach. The team includes mental health technicians or clinician trainees who
   may be involved in your care. You should address questions about this to your provider.

6. Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP). For family members of AD who receive
   care for mental health conditions, your provider must determine if your condition would
   require enrollment in the EFMP. This may entail disclosure of your condition to proper
   medical and command authorities in order to ensure adequate medical care is available at any
   projected new duty location. Enrollment in the EFMP is mandatory for the AD member once
   the special needs of the family have been identified. Not all mental health treatment will
   require this; ask your provider if you have any questions.

7. Medications. If medications are prescribed for you, it is imperative you plan accordingly.
   Ideally we ask that you call 7 days prior to running out of the medications as to not disrupt
   the medication treatment course. You may request a medication refill if you are actively
   under the provider's care and doing well. If not we ask that you schedule an appointment.
AFI44-172 14 MARCH 2011                                                                          53


8. Telephone Consultations. Face-to-face treatment is always the preferred treatment
   modality but is not always possible for your needs or clinic availability. Telephone
   consultations are intended to assist in, not replace, the routine care you receive in our clinic.
   We encourage you to contact your provider in this way any time between scheduled
   appointments if you have questions or concerns about your condition or treatment. We ask
   that you not communicate with your provider by e-mail.
