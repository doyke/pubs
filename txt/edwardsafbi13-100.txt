                                           Chapter 1

                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. Policy. This instruction sets policies and prescribes standard operating procedures for
aircrew and other support element responsibilities assigned to or sponsored by Edwards Air
Force Base (EAFB). This instruction takes precedence over conflicting local directives.
   1.1.1. Tenant units and Edwards AFB based organizations may augment these procedures,
   but must not provide guidance that is less restrictive.
   1.1.2. Before flying in the R-2508 Complex and/or within R-2515, pilots will receive the
   applicable airspace briefing and annual refresher thereafter. Users flying only within R-2508
   require only the R-2508 Complex briefing; those flying within R-2515 require both the R-
   2508 Complex and R-2515 airspace brief. It is the responsibility of local units to ensure
   pilots flying within their organization have received the initial and annual airspace briefing.
   The Central Coordinating Facility (CCF), or their designated representative, is responsible
   for providing R-2508 complex briefing. The R-2515 Airspace Manager, or designated
   representative, is responsible for providing the R-2515 airspace briefing. The annual briefing
   cycle will be provided at the unit request every First Monday Training Day from January
   through May or as requested. If at the end of the annual briefing cycle, pilots have not
   received their annual briefing, they will not be authorized to fly within R-2508 and/or R-
   2515.
       1.1.2.1. Tanker crews on Temporary Duty (TDY) to Edwards for air refueling support
       will receive a local area brief prior to conducting refueling operations within R-2508.
       This briefing can be performed face-to-face or telephonically with visual aide support
       (e.g. power point charts, the R-2508 User’s Handbook, etc). Although not a substitute for
       the briefing, the R-2508 User’s Handbook may be downloaded at:
       http://www.edwards.af.mil/r-2508.asp.
1.2. Waivers to Airfield Operations. Coordinate all deviations or waiver requests for this
instruction through the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). The 412th Operations Group
Commander (OG/CC) is the final approval authority.
1.3. Waivers to Airfield/Airspace Criteria. Deviations and waivers must be approved by the
Installation CC and Headquarters (HQ) Air Force Material Command (AFMC). 412 OSS/OSA
will coordinate, prepare and process airfield and airspace criteria documents as required for the
following purposes:
   1.3.1. Waivers pertaining to airfield criteria processed through 412th Test Wing (TW) Civil
   Engineering.
   1.3.2. Waivers pertaining to Special Use Airspace (SUA) or airspace for special use.
   1.3.3. Airspace proposals directed by environmental requirements as a result of changes in
   the number or types of aircraft or hours of utilization for existing airspace.
   1.3.4. Aeronautical objections to construction activities within the Edwards airspace.
 14                                                  EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013


1.4. Aircraft and Crew Security. All personnel authorized access to the Edwards AFB flight
line and/or assigned to a flight line activity (e.g. maintenance, operations, engineering) are
responsible for safeguarding aircraft against theft, damage, and compromise of classified
materials. Flight line personnel should be alert for and challenge unidentified personnel.
Aircrews are responsible for ensuring Test Wing aircraft are safeguarded at off station locations.
   1.4.1. Federal Aviation Administration Order (FAAO) 7610.4, Special Operations,
   establishes responsibilities and procedures for personnel to cope with acts of unlawful
   aircraft seizure and mission interference both on the ground and in flight.
   1.4.2. Appendix 19 to Annex C to EAFB PLAN 31, Anti-Hijacking and Unauthorized
   Movement of Aircraft, applies to all units involved with aircraft movement. 412 TW/XP is
   the office of primary responsibility for this document.
1.5. Inadvertent Tracking of Sight-Sensitive and Low Observable (LO) Assets. It is strictly
forbidden to train tracking sensors (e.g. radar, infrared, electro-optical, personal cameras, sound
recording devices, etc.) on any LO or sight-sensitive asset within the R-2508 Complex. The
single exception to this rule is to promote safety of flight. If a safety incident occurs, data
recording may continue to assist the Mishap Investigation Board. Recording of data will
immediately terminate upon termination of the safety incident. Contact Security Forces for
Security Procedures For Inadvertent Tracking And Sensor Acquisition Of Low Observable And
Sight Sensitive Programs, provides agency reporting responsibilities in the event of inadvertent
or unauthorized tracking incidents.
1.6. Airfield Operations Board (AOB). The AOB is a forum for discussing, updating and
tracking various activities in support of the 412 TW flying mission. The AOB will meet at least
once per quarter. IAW with AFI 13-204v3, 4.2.1, the 412 TW/CV has delegated the
responsibility to chair the AOB to the 412 OG. AOB membership consists of the personnel listed
in Table 1.1. Annual required agenda items in accordance with (IAW) AFI 13-204 V3, Airfield
Operating Procedures and Programs are listed in Table 1.2.

                      FLIGHT PLANNING/COMPLEX CLEARANCE

2.1. Flight Plan Filing. Crews departing the R-2508 complex must have a flight plan on file
with Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS). Exception: 412 TW aircraft conducting
operations at Palmdale, Victorville and/or Fox Field and civil aircraft (e.g., scheduled air carrier,
general aviation, etc.) are exempt from this requirement (IAW AFI 13-204 V3, Airfield
Operating Procedures and Programs). File Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight plans at least 1
hour prior to Estimated Time of Departure (ETD). File Visual Flight Rules (VFR) flight plans
30 minutes prior to ETD. All international flight plans must be filed at least 2 hours prior to
ETD. Crews remaining within the complex will obtain a complex clearance (i.e. Pancho 3,
Pancho 3 Barstow, or Sage 2)
   2.1.1. Local units including all 412 TW flying organizations, Dryden Flight Research Center
   (NASA) and the Aero Club will comply with the following procedures when filing flight
   plans with AMOPS.
       2.1.1.1. Use Department of Defense (DD) Form (Fm) 175, Military Flight Plan, DD Fm
       1801, International Flight Plan or other authorized form IAW AFI 11-202 V3, General
       Flight Rules, and Flight Information Publication (FLIP) General Planning (GP). Civil
       aircraft and the Aero Club are authorized to use Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
       Fm 7233-1, Flight Plan, to file flight plans.
       2.1.1.2. Original flight plans will not be accepted via radio or telephone IAW AFI 13-
       204 V3, Airfield Operating Procedures and Programs.
       2.1.1.3. All flight plans filed at EAFB must include “participant” or “non-participant” as
       the first item in the remarks section of the flight plan. See Area Planning 1 (AP1) for
       more information.
       2.1.1.4. The aircrew/squadron representative will notify AMOPS of flight plan changes
       due to weather, ground abort, maintenance cancellations, etc., as soon as possible.
   2.1.2. Flight plans may be faxed to AMOPS by organizations assigned to the 412 TW or
   base tenant units.      The Aircraft Commander (AC) is responsible for confirming
   receipt/legibility with AMOPS. Failure to confirm receipt will result in departure delays.
   AMOPS will not file faxed flight plans without receiving a phone call to confirm receipt and
   legibility. Units faxing flight plans must maintain the original flight plan on file IAW Air
   Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS), Table 13-07, Rule 3.00 and AFI 13-204 V3,
   Airfield Operating Procedures and Programs. Flight plans will remain on file for 12
   months, which exceeds the disposition schedule within RDS.
   2.1.3. During airfield closures and non-operating hours, Aero Club will schedule flights on
   the Aero Club schedule and file flights plans with FSS, via phone or Direct User Access
   Terminal System (DUATS). Aero Club members should open/close flight plans with the
   appropriate FSS whenever the airfield is closed.
2.2. Scheduling Use of Restricted Airspace and Military Operating Area(s) (MOA)(s). 412
TW scheduling procedures provide guidance for the scheduling of 412 TW controlled SUA
during and after normal hours.
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                               17


   2.2.1. The R-2508 CCF provides over-flight altitudes for the restricted areas internal to R-
   2508 to High Desert Combined Control Facility (callsign JOSHUA) and the AFTC Military
   Radar Unit (MRU) (callsign SPORT) on a daily basis. Obtain clearance for over-flight
   through JOSHUA or SPORT.
   2.2.2. Outside normal duty hours, Project Managers/Crews shall contact the CCF (866 805-
   2851) for revisions to airspace requirements, cancellation or slips. The FAA requires 2 hours
   advance notification to activate a Military Operations Area(s) (MOA) and 15 minutes to
   activate restricted area(s) when the airspace has been released for joint use.
2.3. Participating/Non-Participating Aircraft. All crews must understand and become
familiar with the R-2508 Complex procedures. Due to the uniqueness of the Complex, the using
agencies have specific operating procedures for coordinating planning and ensuring operations
comply with established procedures and restrictions. Unless otherwise coordinated, all users
shall comply with the following procedures:
   2.3.1. “Participating aircraft” are aircraft under the command of, or sponsored by, the Navy,
   AF or Army members of the R-2508 Joint Policy and Planning Board (JPPB) and civilian
   aircraft under Letter of Agreement (LOA) with the R-2508 Complex Control Board (CCB)
   for flight above FL180 within the shared use areas or the AFTC for flight within R-2515.
   2.3.2. “Non-participating aircraft” are defined as aircraft that cannot comply with the terms
   of the R-2508 Complex procedures. These aircraft shall be provided IFR services as
   specified in FAA Order JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control, and FAA Order 7610.4, Special
   Operations.
2.4. R-2508/R-2515 Complex Clearance Procedures and Flight Planning. Flight within the
R-2508 Complex requires a work area clearance. EAFB and AF Plant 42 based aircraft will be
issued a Pancho 3, a Pancho 3 Barstow, or Sage 2 clearance. Both clearances are VFR “See-
and–Avoid” and do not constitute exclusive use of the airspace. An exception to this policy may
be approved by the CCB for the shared use areas or the 412 OG/CC for R-2515.
   2.4.1. A Pancho 3 clearance includes:
       2.4.1.1. Isabella and Panamint, FL 500 and below.
       2.4.1.2. Owens and Saline, FL290 and below.
   2.4.2. A Pancho 3 Barstow clearance includes:
       2.4.2.1. All the airspace included in the Pancho 3 clearance.
       2.4.2.2. Barstow West, FL500 and below.
       2.4.2.3. Barstow East, FL230 and below.
   2.4.3. A Sage 2 clearance is identical to a Pancho 3 clearance except that it does not include
   the Barstow MOAs or ATCAAs and is restricted to Flight Level (FL) 290 and below.
   2.4.3.1. The Operations Number issued by the 412th Operations Support Squadron’s (412
   OSS) Resource Operations Center (ROC) authorizes crews to depart from, re-enter and
   operate within R-2515 when the airspace has been scheduled for military use.
   2.4.4. Missions requiring areas not included in the Pancho 3 clearance shall schedule these
   areas and associated altitudes through the Resource Operations Center (ROC) and request
18                                                 EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013


  real-time use, to include altitudes, on initial contact with JOSHUA or SPORT. Crews will
  not enter airspace not included in the Pancho 3, or Sage 2 (as applicable) clearance without
  specific authorization by either JOSHUA or SPORT. Request clearance 15 minutes prior.
  FAA Centers have a Military Operations Specialist (MOS) who can assist with the mission
  planning. Mission planners should contact the MOS early in the planning process for
  assistance.
  2.4.5. 412 TW aircrews will use the R-2515 SPORT Pre-brief sheet to provide detailed
  profile information to combined Supervisor of Flying (SOF)/Airboss and SPORT. This sheet
  is available on the Center Operations Online (COOL) homepage in the left side column of
  "Pilot Step Info Links" under the name "R-2515 SPORT Prebrief." Complete this sheet with
  any data relevant to your mission and fax it to SPORT at 661-277-8863 as early as possible.
  Printed copies will be kept available at the unit operations desk. The SPORT watch
  supervisor will create a deconfliction plan and coordinate it with the SOF/Airboss prior to the
  first takeoff and as required during the rest of the day. The SOF/Airboss is the approval
  authority for the deconfliction plan and will monitor the airspace situation, as able, and
  contact the SPORT watch supervisor with concerns. NOTE: All crews flying T-38 aircraft
  with the noseboom modification will make the following annotation on the Sport Brief:
  “***T-38C YAPS Noseboom Modified aircraft – True altitude is higher than indicated,
  reported altitude may be in error by 1,200’ at high subsonic speeds”
     2.4.5.1. Prior to takeoff, local aircrews will contact SPORT to confirm airspace
     utilization and profile. If the flight will be working on an assigned mission frequency in
     R-2515, aircrew may conduct pre-takeoff coordination on mission frequency. If the
     flight will not be operating on a dedicated mission frequency, but instead will be
     monitoring 343.7/132.75 in the airspace, aircrew will use 354.0/139.775 to conduct pre-
     takeoff coordination. SPORT controllers will communicate the deconfliction plan to the
     aircrew during the pre-takeoff airspace brief.
     2.4.5.2. The combination of the pre-brief sheet and pre-takeoff coordination will be used
     by the Airboss and SPORT to proactively deconflict R-2515 with a goal of simplifying
     operations for aircrew, minimizing traffic calls/conflicts, and improving safety. SPORT
     and the Airboss will continue to modify the R-2515 deconfliction plan in real time
     throughout missions, while trying to minimize inputs and mission impact for participating
     crews. Aircrew are encouraged to advise the Air Boss’s representative at SPORT directly
     on 354.0/139.775 when the overall deconfliction plan is not working or their mission
     requirements change, in which case an alternative plan will be developed. Air
     Boss/SPORT direction to aircrew is advisory and dialogue is encouraged to optimize the
     overall plan to meet mission needs unless/until the words, "The Airboss directs..." are
     used, in this case, compliance is mandatory. Airboss direction will be reserved for safety
     of flight issues.
     2.4.5.3. When returning to R-2515 from other airspace with an intent to delay in R-2515,
     aircrews are encouraged to contact the Airboss prior to R-2515 entry to facilitate airspace
     planning and ensure traffic deconfliction. Air Boss is readily available to give "picture"
     calls and suggest areas to work to maximize safety and mission effectiveness at all times
     on 354.0/139.775.
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                  19


   2.4.6. Helicopters departing Edwards are limited to Restricted Area R-2515 at and below
   6,000’MSL. Additional airspace requirements require scheduling through the ROC. Notify
   tower on initial contact to coordinate an appropriate clearance.
   2.4.7. Obtain clearance for airspace for special use (e.g. Alpha Corridor, Precision Impact
   Range Area [PIRA], Spin Areas, Supersonic Corridors, etc.) from SPORT either before or
   after takeoff.
   2.4.8. Although the crew has the primary responsibility to remain within the vertical and
   lateral confines of the airspace specified in the clearance, expect positive control instructions
   from JOSHUA or SPORT to assist in remaining within the airspace boundaries. Crews are
   responsible for complying with these instructions. For flight restrictions within the Complex
   see Chapter 11, Restrictions.
   2.4.9. Crews shall advise JOSHUA or SPORT prior to exiting the Complex. The Complex
   clearance is canceled when the aircraft exits the Complex.
2.5. IFR Departure Procedures. The following procedures will be used when departing the R-
2508 complex under IFR.
   2.5.1. Aircrew can verify their IFR clearance is in the National Airspace System with ground
   control before taxi/takeoff.
   2.5.2. If SPORT is open and VMC conditions prevail, crews will depart with a local
   complex clearance (e.g. Pancho 3, Sage 2). They will be directed to remain VFR in the
   complex at or below their intended IFR departure altitude. Expect a frequency change to
   JOSHUA control for the IFR clearance while VFR within the complex.
   2.5.3. If SPORT is closed or if the airfield is IMC (a VFR departure is not possible), crews
   will obtain IFR departure clearance from ground control.
   2.5.4. Regardless of SPORT’s status, crews planning to depart IFR at or above 14,000 feet
   MSL via EDW, PMD, DAG, DAGGS, HEC or ROSIE will receive their IFR clearance from
   ground control. In this case, crews will be entering LA Center airspace directly.
   2.5.5. Ingress/Egress Fixes.
      2.5.5.1. Thirteen ingress/egress fixes are established around the perimeter of R-2508 (Fig
      2.1.). Crews delaying within the shared use areas of R-2508 or R-2515 on a Complex
      clearance prior to departing IFR shall file through one of these fixes as the second point
      in their flight plan (e.g. R-2508..SWOOP..EHF).
      2.5.5.2. Only six fixes (MITEL, KIOTE, SWOOP, ROSIE, DAGGS and FAANG) are
      recognized as FAA published entry/exit fixes. If filing through other than these FAA
      recognized fixes, use the published coordinates as the second element in the flight plan
      (e.g. EDW…N34.51.22W116.47.20…LAS)
      2.5.5.3. Crews not delaying within R-2508/R-2515 may file Navigational Aid
      (NAVAID) direct (e.g., EDW..DAG).
      2.5.5.4. . Crews delaying within R-2508 on a Pancho 3/Sage 2 clearance and whose
      destination is other than Edwards should contact Pilot to Dispatcher (372.2) to activate
      the flight plan.

2.6. IFR Clearances for Cloud Breaks.
   2.6.1. When SPORT has control of R-2515, crews that need to penetrate IMC will remain in
   VMC and coordinate with SPORT for a transfer of control to JOSHUA. Expect delays as
   SPORT coordinates for release of airspace to JOSHUA. After transfer of control to
   JOSHUA an IFR clearance will be issued. Crews shall cancel when able to resume flight in
   VMC. If JOSHUA has control of R-2515, request an IFR clearance directly.
   2.6.2. Outside or R-2515 but within R-2508 crews will contact JOSHUA on the appropriate
   frequency for IFR clearances while seeking VMC.

     2.7.2.1. Flights not utilizing COOL, flights not taking off and landing at the same local
     area airfield or flights departing the local area VFR or IFR.
     2.7.2.2. Local IFR flights when the Complex airspace is released to the FAA for joint
     use. Verify with the ROC (7-3940) or CCF (7-2508) to determine if the airspace will be
     active for military use or if released to the FAA for joint use.
     2.7.2.3. Requesting the High Altitude Supersonic Corridor (HSSC) outside of R-2508.
  2.7.3. Use DD Form 1801, DoD International Flight Plan, for international flights in
  accordance with FLIP/GP, Chapter 4.

 NOTE 1: Lakebed Rwy 6/24 (Taxiway Delta extension) is aligned 220 degrees but numbered
 24 to avoid confusion with Rwy 4R/22L and its lakebed extension. Lakebed Rwy 24 is
 normally used as an entry/exit point to the lakebed via taxiway Delta. Propeller driven
 aircraft may use this runway for normal takeoff and landing. Fighter/trainer type aircraft
 should not use lakebed Rwy 6/24 for recovery unless it is the only option.
 NOTE 2: Lakebed Rwy 33 landing threshold is displaced 7,500 ft and located adjacent to
 primary Rwy 22L underrun and has centerline markings.
 NOTE 3: Tower may instruct vehicles to proceed directly to an area on the Lakebed Complex
 without stating specific approval to cross each Lakebed Runway. If tower issues no specific
 restrictions, vehicles are authorized to cross all Lakebed Runways along their route.

  4.2.2. When necessary to ensure safe flight operations, the Supervisor of Flying (SOF) will
  coordinate with the ATC Tower Watch Supervisor/Senior Controller for runway changes.
  4.2.3. Main Base Rwy 22L is designated as the calm wind and primary instrument runway.
  It will remain the active runway unless the tailwind component exceeds 10 knots.
  4.2.4. Main Base Rwy 22R/4L is available for the following operations:
     4.2.4.1. UAS operations.
     4.2.4.2. Aircraft taxi.
     4.2.4.3. Aircraft recovery to a full stop when Runway 22L/4R is closed (or operations
     are suspended) and the aircraft commander requests a full stop.
     4.2.4.4. U-2/ER-2 takeoffs and full-stop landings.
     4.2.4.5. Units may request additional use of the Runway 22R/4L (inside runway) by
     submitting justification to the 412 OG/CC. Justification should include impacts to
     normal Runway 22L/4R (outside runway) operations (if not granted), scope of
     operations, timeframe, and whether the request is for short-term or long-term use.
     Special emphasis should be placed on flight safety; convenience is not considered
     appropriate justification. Units shall track the tangible/intangible benefits of actual inside
     runway use in order to justify permanent funding.
  4.2.5. During a runway change, Tower shall:
     4.2.5.1. Advise aircraft on ATC frequencies (except VHF 121.5/UHF 243.0) of
     impending runway change.
     4.2.5.2. Notify AMOPS, SPORT, Fire Department, Barrier Maintenance, JOSHUA,
     MOC and Base Weather.
  4.2.6. SPORT shall advise aircraft on common/mission frequencies of the impending
  runway change.
  4.2.7. Procedures for Runway Suspension. When Tower personnel detect or are advised of
  an unsafe condition with respect to the runway, operations to/from the runway will be
  suspended. Tower will coordinate unsafe conditions with AMOPS, SPORT, JOSHUA and
  MOC.
     4.2.7.1. Resuming Runway operations, AMOPS will perform a runway check prior to
     resuming operations and provide an estimate of the duration of the suspension or closure.
     AMOPS will normally position at the approach end of the affected runway to conduct a
     FOD Check, inspect pavement problems or check the tension on the BAK-12s and tie
     downs.
  4.2.8. The following procedures will be used to open runways.
     4.2.8.1. AMOPS will conduct a runway check on the primary runway prior to the first
     takeoff to ensure the runway is free from foreign object damage (FOD) and other
     hazards.
     4.2.8.2. AMOPS provides runway oversight during non-operating hours and will provide
     a briefing to tower personnel prior to Tower assuming responsibility of the runways.
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                              33


       This briefing will include vehicles/personnel on the runway, runway maintenance or
       other significant operations affecting flying safety.
       4.2.8.3. During 24-hour operations, Tower will maintain control of the runways with no
       required briefing.
       4.2.8.4. Airfield Management performs a daily airfield inspection to include lakebed
       runways, Monday – Friday. On weekends, AMOPS will conduct an airfield inspection
       on Main Base and South Base. North Base and Lakebed runways are not inspected on
       weekends. By request only, Rosamond Lakebed is inspected prior to any proposed use to
       determine if it is suitable for landings and departures.
   4.2.9. Procedures for Runway Closure. AMOPS has the authority to impose airfield
   restrictions (close/suspend and resume airfield, runway or taxiway operations). Airfield
   Management is the final approval authority for opening the runway after a
   suspension/closure. AMOPS will advise Tower and 412 TW/CP of changes in runway
   status.
       4.2.9.1. The SOF may waive the requirement for a runway suspension/closure if required
       to recover an inflight emergency (IFE) or ground emergency. The SOF shall notify
       AMOPS when a “SOF Call” has been initiated. 412 OSS/OSOA personnel will
       document an entry in the ATC/AM Daily Record of Facility Operations, AF Form 3616,
       of each “SOF Call” determination.
4.3. Airfield/Controlled Movement Area (CMA)/Visual and Radio Blind Spots. Control of
ground traffic in the CMA is defined in the Edwards Air Force Base Airfield Driving Instruction.
Airfield Visual and Radio Blind Spots are located in Attachment 6.
   4.3.1. All vehicles or personnel operating on or within 100’ of the aircraft movement area
   must have specific tower approval and maintain two-way radio communications with Tower.
   4.3.2. Edwards Controlled Movement Area (CMA) includes Main Base Runway 4R/22L and
   4L/22R, North Base Runway 6/24, South Base Runway 6/24, and all of Rogers (excluding
   the Flyby Tower) and Rosamond Dry Lakebed south of Rosamond Blvd.
   4.3.3. In the event of vehicle/Tower radio failure:
       4.3.3.1. Tower will use light gun signals to communicate with vehicles. If light gun
       signals fail, the Tower will flash the runway edge lights on and off to alert vehicle
       operators/pedestrians on the runway that there is a problem and/or emergency that
       requires them to immediately exit the runway.
       4.3.3.2. All drivers/pedestrians must exit the runway immediately. After exiting the
       runway, immediately contact Tower or AMOPS with any pertinent information that
       might affect flight operations. If not able to communicate with Tower or AMOPS via
       radio, use other means of communication such as a cellular phone (when available). If
       radio contact cannot be re-established vehicles/pedestrians will hold position and await
       the arrival of AMOPS. Report incident to AMOPS immediately.

       4.4.1.1. Rwy 4R/22L is equipped with High Intensity Runway Lights (HIRLs) and has
       five adjustable settings controlled by the tower lighting panel. Rwy 22L (only) has
       Runway End Identifier Lights (REILs).
       4.4.1.2. Taxiways Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Echo, Foxtrot (Taxilane) and Golf have blue
       flush-mounted taxiway lights with three adjustable settings.
       4.4.1.3. Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) lights are located on the left side of
       the approach ends of Rwy 4R/22L and are controlled by the Tower.
       4.4.1.4. Pilot controlled lighting is available during non-operating hours. Keying up
       three times on the Tower frequencies UHF 318.1 within five seconds turns on the PAPIs,
       HIRLs and taxiway lights. The HIRLs will be on the lowest setting. Keying up five
       times within five seconds sets the HIRLs on a medium setting while seven key-ups within
       five seconds sets the HIRLs to their highest setting.
       4.4.1.5. Obstruction lights are affixed atop structures of more than 50’ high.
       4.4.1.6. A rotating beacon located atop building 1600 is operated between official sunset
       and sunrise when the airfield is open or when airfield weather conditions are reported as
       IFR.
       4.4.1.7. Rwy 4L/22R has no light configuration and is restricted to operation between
       sunrise and sunset.
   4.4.2. North Base:
       4.4.2.1. Rwy 6/24 is equipped with HIRLS and threshold lighting.
       4.4.2.2. Rwy 6/24 is equipped with PAPI lights positioned on the left side of the runway.
       4.4.2.3. Taxiway November-1 is equipped with single intensity taxiway lights and can be
       activated when the lights are activated.
       4.4.2.4. The North Base lighting system is equipped with pilot-controlled capability on
       VHF 129.1. Keying up three times on VHF 129.1 within five seconds turns on the PAPIs,
       HIRLs and taxiway lights. The HIRLs will be on the lowest setting. Keying up five
       times within five seconds sets the HIRLs on a medium setting while seven key-ups within
       five seconds sets the HIRLs to their highest setting.
   4.4.3. South Base Rwy 6/24 is not equipped with operable lighting and is restricted to
   daylight/VFR operations only.
4.5. Permanently Closed/Unused Areas of the Airfield. The only permanently closed areas
are South Base Runway 12/30, Taxiways Sierra 2, and Sierra 6 (Fig 4.3.). Temporary closures
are experienced during extended periods of construction, restricting access to aircraft operations.
These areas are properly marked with either painted yellow Xs or low profile lit barriers.
4.6. Aircraft Arresting System. Barrier Arresting Kit (BAK) 12B cable locations are 1,559’
from the approach end of Rwy 22L and 1,512’ from the approach end of Rwy 4R. The barrier at
the departure end of the operational runway will be in the raised position. Arresting gear

markers indicator lights are installed on each side of the runway adjacent to cable locations.
Lights are parallel with the runway distance remaining markers and consist of large (39-inch
diameter) yellow circles on black marker boards. Procedures for the arresting systems are:
   4.6.1. Civil Engineering Power Production is responsible for the certification of the arresting
   systems Monday - Friday from 0600L-1600L. Power Production will perform an inspection
   of the barrier prior to any planned engagement. During either a runway change or a barrier
   engagement, the Tower is responsible for notifying AMOPS, Barrier Maintenance, Fire
   Department, MOCC, Weather, SPORT, and JOSHUA.
   4.6.2. Outside normal duty hours, the Fire Department is responsible for rigging and de-
   rigging but does not have the authority to certify the cable. Civil Engineer Power Production
   will certify the cable. Certification of the cable is not necessary for emergency use.
   4.6.3. The Rwy 22L departure end cable remains raised (operational) unless removal (non-
   operational) is required for an emergency or planned test event. The Rwy 22L approach end
   cable may be raised for an emergency (pilot request) or scheduled test event. The barrier is
   removed from the runway during extended closures.
   4.6.4. At least 10 minutes prior to a runway change Tower will advise SPORT, JOSHUA
   and AMOPS of the requirement to change arresting cable configuration. Tower and SPORT
   will advise pilots of suspending runway operations to change the cable configuration. Each
   rigging and de-rigging takes approximately 15-20 minutes. Each consecutive engagement
   (same cable) will require 15-20 minutes for re-stringing and certification.
   4.6.5. During either a Rwy 22L departure or a Rwy 4R approach end engagement, AMOPS
   will direct TA to provide a tug to remove the aircraft out of the cable and off the runway. For
   all other engagements, the owning organization will provide tug support due to the distance
   from TA. TA is responsible for removing all transient aircraft.
4.7. Parking/Runway Restrictions.
   4.7.1. Main Base parking restrictions are limited to specific aircraft wingspans on each of the
   following ramps:
       4.7.1.1. Sun Sheltered parking aprons are restricted to fighter type aircraft with
       wingspans less than 44.7’.
       4.7.1.2. Parking Rows Alpha through Foxtrot are restricted to aircraft with wingspans
       less than 132’ on the parking spots immediately adjacent to Foxtrot Taxilane.
       4.7.1.3. Aircraft with a wingspan of 170’ or more must coordinate parking instructions
       with airfield management.
   4.7.2. All operations requiring use of the North Base Runway require the approval of the 412
   OG/CC. Test missions using North Base will schedule Crash/Fire/Rescue support IAW
   Edwards AFB Scheduling Procedures for Aircraft and Air/Ground Support.
   4.7.3. South Base runway is designated as a Class A runway and is limited to daytime VFR
   operations for aircraft weighing 12,500 lbs or less.

4.14. Aircraft Taxiing Procedures. Pilots will obtain ATIS information before contacting
Ground Control for taxi. When a taxi clearance is issued, pilots will read back runway
assignment and maintain radio contact with Ground Control.
   4.14.1. Heavy/large aircraft will contact Tower abeam “last chance” shack for takeoff
   sequencing instructions. Heavy/large aircraft will not block access to the runway by stopping
   beyond the exit from “last chance” until appropriately sequenced by Tower. T-38s not
   carrying munitions will not go through last chance checks.
   4.14.2. Opposite direction taxi procedures:
      4.14.2.1. Between sunrise and sunset, locally assigned aircraft with a wingspan of 45’ or
      less are authorized to conduct opposite direction taxi operations on all useable taxiways
      of 100’ or more in width (Bravo taxiway is less than 100’ in width).
      4.14.2.2. Aircraft shall offset their wingtips 10’ either side of the centerline until passing
      oncoming taxiing aircraft.
      4.14.2.3. Tower will issue the following instruction: “(Callsign), taxi right side of
      taxiway, use caution for (type) taxiing opposite direction”.
   4.14.3. Taxi restrictions. Transient aircraft on Taxilane Foxtrot adjacent to sunshelters
   (between parking rows L-M) with a wingspan 170’ or greater require wing-walkers.
      4.14.3.1. Aircraft with wingspans of 100 ft or less may taxi on the taxilane from Ramp 1
      to Ramp 2. Aircraft with greater wingspans must be towed accompanied by wing
      walkers.
      4.14.3.2. Aircraft with wingspans of 55 ft or less may taxi on the taxilane from Ramp 1
      to Ramp 3. Aircraft with greater wingspans must be towed accompanied by wing
      walkers.
4.15. Local Departure Procedures.
   4.15.1. Use Tower primary UHF frequency (Attachment 3) unless a test mission frequency
   is required for a particular flight test. The requirement for Tower to monitor on mission
   frequency (e.g. re-start missions) must be pre-coordinated.
   4.15.2. Unless otherwise instructed by Tower:
 38                                                EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013


       4.15.2.1. During daytime VFR operations, all departing turboprop/turbojet aircraft will
       auto switch to departure frequency after crossing departure end of the runway.
       4.15.2.2. During nighttime or IFR operations, Tower informs all departing turboprop/jet
       aircraft (except transport and cargo types) to change to departure control frequency
       before takeoff.
       4.15.2.3. During day/nighttime VFR or IFR operations, Tower informs all departing civil
       aircraft and military transport and cargo types to change to departure control frequency
       approximately 1/2 mile beyond departure end of the runway.
4.16. Aircraft Towing Procedures. When towing an aircraft, use Ground Control UHF radio
or Ramp Net Land Mobile Radios when communicating with Tower.
   4.16.1. Before towing an aircraft on or across an established taxiway or runway, the tow
   supervisor will obtain clearance from the Tower. At no time will any aircraft be towed on or
   across runways or taxiways without advance approval from Tower. The primary means of
   communication will be the aircraft radio. An alternate method (when conditions restrict
   aircraft battery operation) is through an escort vehicle in direct contact with Tower. The
   radio equipped escort vehicle will accompany the aircraft throughout the towing operation.
   4.16.2. Bravo taxiway is the primary taxiway for tows requiring runway crossings to/from
   South Base.
4.17. Engine Test/Run-Up/Jet Blast Avoidance. Aircraft engine run-up areas and
maintenance policies/guidelines, as they relate to aircraft maintenance engine operations, are
defined in the 412 MXG OI 21-218, Aircraft Engine Maintenance Run. Additional quiet hours
may occur during ceremonies or to comply with noise abatement rules during specified times and
as directed by the 412 OG/CC. Use caution for heavy jet blast when operating near or taxiing
behind heavy jets.
4.18. Noise Abatement/Flying Avoidance Areas.
   4.18.1. Do not overfly the 412 TW medical clinic and family housing. Executing a turn
   beyond 12 DME from the VORTAC will ensure avoidance of these areas.
   4.18.2. Do not overfly the Small Arms Range Complex (SARC) below 7,000’ MSL (Fig
   4.5.) when active. Tower will advise aircrews when the SARC is active via the ATIS and
   Tower frequency. SARC procedures are located in the SARC Operations Letter.
   4.18.3. The Engine Test Lab building (Bldg) 3804 and the Hush House (Bldg 1735) produce
   exhaust temperatures of 150° Fahrenheit and exhaust velocities of 95 mph at nozzle distance
   of 600’. Do not over fly either of these facilities below 1,000’ Above Ground Level (AGL)
   within a 500-foot radius (Fig 4.6.).

4.19. Unscheduled Aircraft Arrivals. In the event of an unauthorized aircraft landing, the
suspect aircraft must be isolated until cleared by Security Forces. An unscheduled aircraft is
defined as any aircraft that has not acquired a Civil Aircraft Landing Permit or a Prior
Permission Required (PPR) number and/or lands without an ATC clearance. Unscheduled
aircraft landings include unscheduled aircraft that declared an in-flight emergency and were
subsequently given permission to land. Tower will notify the command post of unscheduled
aircraft arrivals; the command post will notify the 412 OG/CC.
4.20. Wear of Hats on Airfield. Due to extreme heat conditions, hats are authorized on the
airfield. EXCEPTION: Hats will not be worn within 25’ of an aircraft while engines are
running.
4.21. Flightline Customs and Courtesies. Personnel working on the flightline will not salute
or offer customs and courtesies during reveille or retreat ceremonies.

   unlimited, while R-2506 is SFC to 6,000' mean sea level (MSL). All of these require prior
   approval from the using agency.
   5.2.2. When R-2508 is released for joint use, the MOAs and ATCAAs upper limits are
   FL600. The Owens ATCAA overlies the Bishop MOA.

   5.2.3. The MOAs and ATCAAs, when combined with the restricted areas increase the usable
   Special Use Area (SUA). Attachment 5 lists the geographical coordinates, altimeter settings
   and flight restrictions for the MOAs associated with the R-2508 Complex.
   5.2.4. The R-2508 Complex ATCAAs fill the airspace between the top of the MOAs (not
   including FL180) and the base of R-2508 (FL200). When R-2508 is inactive, the ATCAAs
   extend to FL600. ATCAAs overlie the peripheral MOAs providing additional airspace to
   FL600. Deep Springs is solely ATCAA from FL240 to FL600.

   10-minute real-time notification to the FAA prior to use. Make real-time requests through
   either JOSHUA or SPORT.
   5.2.6. The Isabella, Owens, Saline, Panamint, Barstow, Buckhorn and Shoshone MOAs have
   a minimum altitude limit of 200' AGL. Bakersfield and Porterville MOAs have a 2,000' AGL
   minimum altitude.
   5.2.7. The Isabella, Owens, Saline, Panamint and Shoshone MOAs exclude the airspace SFC
   to 3,000' AGL over National Parks and some Wilderness Areas and do not include airspace
   below 1,500' AGL within 3 NM of any uncontrolled charted airport. Portions of these MOAs
   also overlie certain noise sensitive and natural recreational areas and, if possible, should be
   avoided.
       5.2.7.1. Domeland and the John Muir Wilderness Areas and the Sequoia and Kings
       Canyon National Parks lie within and northwest of R-2508. Flight within these areas is
       restricted to no lower than 3,000’ AGL and 3,000’ laterally from canyon walls or
       mountains. To the maximum extent possible, plan missions to avoid these areas. Flight
       below FL180 over Sequoia/Kings Canyon National Park requires specific scheduling.
       5.2.7.2. In the expanded area of the Domeland Wilderness Area, established after 1977,
       over-flight is authorized down to 200’ AGL.
       5.2.7.3. Death Valley National Park, formerly known as Death Valley National
       Monument, as established in 1977 and prior to designation as a National Park, is
       particularly sensitive and will be avoided except for mission essential over-flight. Over-
       flight is restricted to 3,000’ AGL or higher within the 1977 boundaries. Over-flight is
       authorized down to 200’ AGL in the 1994 expanded area of the National Park within the
       Panamint and Saline MOAs.
       5.2.7.4. Owens and Saline are capped at FL290 and available for normal R-2508
       operations. Altitudes above FL290 must be scheduled and require a real-time 10-minute
       advance notification with JOSHUA to coordinate with adjacent FAA centers.
       5.2.7.5. Overflight of populated areas within and surrounding the R-2508 complex is
       restricted to 3,000’ AGL or above. See paragraph 11.1, Overflight of Populated Areas,
       and Attachment 5, Geographical Coordinates for R-2508 Airspace Areas, for further
       over-flight restrictions.
5.3. Airspace Operating Hours. R-2508’s core hours of operation are 0630L to 2230L
Monday-Friday and 0800L to 1600L Saturday and Sunday. Core hours are defined as hours of
operation that includes Air Traffic Advisories by JOSHUA while operating within R-2508 on a
Complex clearance. Crews are requested to schedule within the core hours. Squadrons with
requirements to operate outside these core hours must request air traffic support through the
Central Coordinating Facility (CCF) at least 72 hours prior to the scheduled flight. The CCF will
advise on the availability of air traffic support.
5.4. Encountering IMC. Procedures described in this paragraph only apply to the shared use
areas of R-2508. IMC missions are not authorized within the R-2508 Complex. The only
condition in which a participating aircraft will be issued an IFR clearance to continue operations
is if the aircraft encounters weather conditions below the minimum for flight under VFR and is
unable to proceed under VFR.
 46                                                  EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013


   5.4.1. If unable to maintain VMC, request an IFR clearance. Upon reaching VMC cancel the
   IFR clearance and maintain VMC. JOSHUA will reissue the complex clearance.
   5.4.2. The purpose of an IFR clearance is to position the aircraft in weather conditions,
   which permit VMC flight to exit the area or to return to base if unable to locate VMC. After
   re-encountering VMC, the aircrew is responsible for canceling IFR clearance.
5.5. Altimeter Settings. Altimeter settings for the R-2508 MOAs and internal Restricted Areas
are:
   5.5.1. Isabella, Bakersfield, Barstow and Buckhorn use the Edwards altimeter.
   5.5.2. Owens, Saline, Panamint, Shoshone, Bishop and Porterville use China Lake altimeter.
   5.5.3. Altimeter settings for the internal Restricted Areas will be issued by the respective
   controlling/using facility. During periods when services are not available, JOSHUA will
   issue either the Edwards or Palmdale altimeter setting for operations within R-2508.
5.6. JOSHUA Advisory Services. JOSHUA provides traffic advisories and boundary calls to
the maximum extent possible to all aircraft operating within the R-2508 Complex on Work Area
Frequencies (Table 5.1.).

Table 5.1. JOSHUA Advisory Frequencies
 Owens        322.3      126.55
 Saline       256.8      123.95
 Panamint     291.6      120.25
 Isabella     348.7      133.65
 Palmdale     363.0      124.55
   5.6.1. JOSHUA provides two types of monitoring services for aircraft utilizing specific
   mission frequencies. Due to site limitations, both of these services are on a first-come, first-
   serve basis workload permitting.
       5.6.1.1. Active monitoring - JOSHUA is actively listening on mission frequency but will
       not simulcast. If boundary or traffic advisories are required, the controller must select the
       transmitter. If workload dictates, JOSHUA may simulcast traffic advisories to mission
       aircraft. Aircrews must request JOSHUA terminate simulcasting routine/non-mission
       related advisories. Due to the increased workload active monitoring creates, it should
       only be requested when operationally required.
       5.6.1.2. Inactive Monitoring - JOSHUA tunes transceiver to mission frequency
       requested, but does NOT listen on frequency. Traffic and boundary calls will be made on
       mission frequency as needed. Direct pilot-to-controller communications requires the
       pilot to switch to an ATC frequency.
   5.6.2. Inactively monitored aircraft must contact JOSHUA on the work area’s ATC
   frequency for amended clearances, requests, Return to Base (RTB), etc. Neither JOSHUA
   nor SPORT monitor the low-level frequency (UHF 315.9).
   5.6.3. JOSHUA may use the term "maneuvering" as part of the traffic call. The term
   “maneuvering” indicates traffic is changing direction and/or altitude so rapidly the controller
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                47


   is unable to provide accurate position or altitude information (Example: "Traffic, F-16,
   northwest, ten miles, maneuvering").
   5.6.4. Crews should advise controllers prior to executing maneuvers that require rapid
   direction and/or altitude changes (e.g., course reversal) so appropriate traffic advisories may
   be issued.
5.7. Lights Out Operations. Lights Out operations within the shared use areas of R-2508
requires units to establish a Letter of Procedure with the CCB; otherwise, these operations must
be contained within the internal restricted areas (R-2515, R-2505, R-2524 etc). Units requiring
Lights Out operations shall contact the scheduling agency for the planned operations. Aircraft
position lights shall remain on while transiting to/from the scheduled restricted area and may be
turned off when established within the internal restricted area (excludes R-2508). Crews shall
advise the controlling/using agency when commencing/terminating Lights Out operations. A
waiver to the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 91.209 (Aircraft Lights) is unnecessary if the
aircraft is operating in a restricted area in compliance with the Using/Scheduling Agency's rules
of operation.
5.8. Aerial Refueling (AR) Area Avoidance. All AR areas in the R-2508 Complex shall be
considered HOT unless confirmed cold with JOSHUA or SPORT. Crews operating within the
vicinity of R-2508 Complex refueling areas (Isabella, Coaldale, and Shoshone) should be
vigilant for tanker formations. If notified that the track is active or if a tanker formation is
observed (visually or by radar) avoid the tanker formation by a minimum of 2,000’ vertically and
5 miles horizontally. This ensures separation in the event of an emergency breakaway maneuver
and will minimize the chance of activating the tanker’s Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance
System.
5.9. Air Refueling Areas and Procedures (Fig 5. 5. and Attachment 4 items 186-191). R-
2508 AR areas are as follows with coordinates listed in Attachment 4:
   5.9.1. Coaldale (OAL) AR area. OAL155/60 to OAL 155/90. Remain West (W) of the OAL
   143 Radial (R), outbound on the OAL 155R with left turns. Minimum refueling altitude is
   10,000’ MSL.
   5.9.2. Shoshone AR area. Beatty (BTY) 150/40 to BTY 150/60 inbound on the BTY 150R
   with left turns.
       5.9.2.1. Minimum refueling altitude is 12,000 MSL. Authorized frequency is UHF
       272.175.
       5.9.2.2. Schedule the Shoshone MOA and/or Shoshone ATCAA in addition to Panamint.
   5.9.3. Isabella AR area. Palmdale (PMD) 345/35 to PMD 345/70. Minimum refueling
   altitude is 21,000' MSL. The Isabella AR is the AFTC’s primary area and should be used to
   the maximum extent possible.

Figure 5.5. R-2508/R-2515 Refueling Areas




      5.9.3.1. Suggested turn point to intercept the outbound refueling leg is the PMD 325/37.
      5.9.3.2. If using a larger radius turn (less than 30 bank), schedule the Bakersfield and
      Porterville MOAs/ATCAAs in advance to avoid a potential spill out. Bakersfield and
      Porterville are not always available.
   5.9.4. 412TW Air Refueling (AR) Areas.
      5.9.4.1. Triad AR. Goffs (GFS) 262/105 to GFS 262/75. Minimum refueling altitude is
      16,000’ MSL.
         5.9.4.1.1. The Triad AR area, must be scheduled in advance to de-conflict R-2502N,
         R-2524 and Goldstone activities. Enter on the PMD 030R to intercept the GFS 262R,
         turn right tracking inbound on the 262R and turn left at the GFS 262/75 to parallel the
         track outbound. Suggested turn point to reestablish on the 262R is the GFS 268/106
         (N3529.9’ W11716.3’).
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                            49


        5.9.4.1.2. Prior to use, coordinate with JOSHUA to ensure the refueling altitude is
        above the over-flight altitudes for R-2524 and R-2502N and above the minimum
        over-flight restriction for the Goldstone Complex of 15,000’ MSL.
        5.9.4.1.3. At altitudes below 25,000’ MSL, GFS reception may be weak so plan to
        use visual references or Inertial Navigation System (INS)/Global Positioning System
        (GPS) waypoints.
     5.9.4.2. R-2515 AR. Edwards (EDW) 068/09 to EDW 068/49.
        5.9.4.2.1. Requires scheduling R-2502N, R-2502E and R-2524 to deconflict
        operations and 412 OG/CC approval.
        5.9.4.2.2. From PMD, proceed to EDW outbound on the 068R to the 20 Distance
        Measuring Equipment (DME) fix and hold N, nonstandard left turns, outbound from
        the 20 to 30 DME fix. After join-up, conduct refueling in the 40NM racetrack pattern
        outbound on the 068R to the 49 DME fix, left 30 turn to parallel the outbound ground
        track.
        5.9.4.2.3. The suggested turn point to intercept and proceed out on the 068R is the
        EDW 008/15 (N3513.4’ W11736.3’). Do not deviate south (S) of the 068R as this
        places the aircraft outside the restricted airspace boundary.
     5.9.4.3. R-2515 Modified AR. EDW068/09 to EDW 068/34. Remain W of R-2502N and
     R2502E and S of R-2524 (Remain S of EDW 052/38). The use of this track requires 412
     OG/CC approval.
        5.9.4.3.1. Use the modified AR when the refueling altitude is below the over-flight
        altitudes for R-2502N/E and R-2524.
        5.9.4.3.2. Turn at EDW 068/34 remaining W of R-2502N/E and S of R-2524
        (Remain S of EDW 052/38). Use this procedure when the over-flight altitude of R-
        2502N/E is above the refueling altitude unless Fort Irwin scheduling specifically
        authorizes refueling below the over-flight altitude.
  5.9.5. AR Procedures.
     5.9.5.1. General Rules. Each tanker will be assigned a primary boom frequency for AR.
     The AR frequencies available for use within R-2508 are 228.95, 249.525, 354.4, and
     375.025. Each frequency will be assigned to a tanker by Test Ops scheduling and will be
     published in COOL. For dedicated AR test missions (AR FTT, JSF AR certs, etc.) or
     missions outside of R-2508 (i.e. Sea Test Range), the primary mission frequency will be
     used for AR. Additionally, dedicated AR test missions will not accept adhoc receivers. If
     users are unsure of which AR frequency the tanker is using, they can always query ATC.
     Tankers crews must include AR frequency on the SPORT Pre-brief sheet. Crews
     requiring the tanker to monitor the mission frequency will pre-brief the tanker crew and
     notify JOSHUA airborne of the frequency used. If a second tanker is present a second
     boom frequency will be used. Normally, tanker rendezvous will be conducted from below
     and departing aircraft will depart high.
     5.9.5.2. Receivers maintain 1,000’ vertical clearance from air refueling block altitude
     and remain outside five (5) NM from the tanker until the following is accomplished:
 50                                                 EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013


           5.9.5.2.1. Contact has been established with the tanker on the AR frequency and a
           range and position with reference to the tanker has been provided.
           5.9.5.2.2. Status of refueling operations to include number of aircraft on the tanker
           and other aircraft merging for AR operations has been established.
       5.9.5.3. Once in contact with the tanker and when requested by the tanker crew, pass call
       sign, tail number and operations number (for mission symbol 04 or 05) or Job Order
       Number (for mission symbol 03, 06, 07 or 08) if required
       5.9.5.4. Post AR but prior to departing the AAR formation, receivers must receive a
       clearance from ATC. Receiver aircrew will brief their post tanking departure procedures
       with the tanker crew in the mission pre-brief or, as a minimum, prior to departing the
       tanker.
       5.9.5.5. The tanker receives traffic advisories on JOSHUA’s or SPORT’s frequency.
       5.9.5.6. Random receiver refueling or dry hookups should not be accomplished on the
       test mission frequency. Other units may simultaneously use the Isabella refueling area at
       de-conflicted altitudes.
       5.9.5.7. AR test missions will request additional maneuvering airspace when not
       remaining within the confines of the AR area (e.g., longer legs are required to meet test
       objectives).
       5.9.5.8. Use of the R-2515 or R-2515 Modified ARs requires 412 OG/CC approval.
       Contact JOSHUA (or SPORT for the R-2515 or R-2515 Modified track) for all tanker
       rendezvous and departures.
5.10. Electronic Combat Range (ECR) R-2524 (Fig 5. 6., Attachment 4, Item 192). R-2524
airspace may be scheduled for over-flight after-hours or for Friday-Sunday operations but will be
released for joint-use when not scheduled during ECR working hours. Over-flight of R-2524
does not include the release of flares or ordnance within Superior Valley. Obtain specific
approval for these operations during the scheduling process with the ROC and specify the type of
airspace activity other than transit (Remotely Piloted Aircraft [UAS] support, refueling, etc.).
   5.10.1. During normal hours, China Lake’s MRU, (Call Sign: China Control), may approve
   real-time over-flights above 6,000’ MSL on a non-interference basis. Real-time use of the
   airspace must be requested through SPORT who coordinates with China Control for final
   approval.
   5.10.2. China Lake controls R-2524, which encompasses the ECR, Superior Valley and
   Mojave B2 North target area as shown in Fig 5.10. Forward airspace requests to the ROC
   IAW AFFTCI 11-15. China Lake allocates range periods and offers alternate times if
   requested times are not available. Designated impact ranges are non-instrumented and
   unmanned. R-2524 airspace is available on most Fridays and weekends. Weekend airspace
   requirements should be scheduled before noon on Thursday.
   5.10.3. ECR/R-2524, commonly referred to as “Echo Range”, is primarily used as an
   electronic countermeasures range.

   30mm inert rounds with tracers. Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD)
   China Lake will consider other ordnance on a case-by-case basis.
5.11. R-2524/Mojave B2 North Range Area (Fig 5. 7., Attachment 4 item 193). Air-to-
ground gunnery, rocket firing, external stores separation, and tank jettison are authorized. Plan
firing or release operations to impact north of N3538.9’, east of W11710.0’, south of N35°47.7
and west of W116°55.4. Currently approved profiles may be obtained from the Electronic
Combat Range Test Management Office at DSN 437-9125. This area contains two convoy
targets and a simulated airfield with aircraft targets for use with inert ordnance only. Use of
Mojave B2 North must be scheduled and is approved on a space available basis.
   5.11.1. After check-in, China Control (UHF 301.0) will transfer the flight to Echo Control
   (UHF 381.9) until mission completion. Checkout will be with China Control.
   5.11.2. Aircraft are required to make a clearing pass at an altitude of 5000’ AGL or below
   prior to firing or releasing on target. Report “target clear” to Echo Control or China Control.
   5.11.3. Obtain clearance to expend inert ordnance on Mojave B2 North from Echo or China
   Control. An expended inert ordnance count shall be passed on completion of the mission.

      5.11.4.1. Strafe at 30° or greater dive angles. Minimum pullout altitude is 1,500' AGL.
      The strafe angle restrictions are waived for reasons such as gas ingestion, vibration
      analysis, etc. However, the 1,500' AGL minimum pullout altitude is always mandatory.
      5.11.4.2. Low angle bomb releases, rockets or missiles are restricted to 300' AGL
      minimum pullout altitude. The minimum pullout altitude will not be below 1,500' AGL.
      5.11.4.3. Specify in the test plan when a waiver from restrictions is required. The Test
      Safety Review will approve or disapprove the waiver request.
   5.11.5. Aerial Gunnery Tow System (AGTS) Procedures.
      5.11.5.1. Clearance to transit R-2524 is clearance to deploy the AGTS at pilot's

   aircraft to Superior Control until the aircraft is ready to checkout with China Control.
   5.12.3. Enter Superior Valley from the south unless China Control approves deviation.
   Entry from the east (Goldstone) is prohibited.
   5.12.4. Do not release ordnance without Range Control Officer (RCO) approval. Only use
   non-explosive training ordnance (e.g., small spotting charges). The RCO advises flight lead
   when 5 minutes remain on the range. Flight lead will call "Last Pass" on base for final
   pattern. Safe weapons prior to exiting the range.

   5.12.6. After completion, contact the RCO with the number of expended ordnances. The
   RCO will pass the flight to China Control for transfer to SPORT or JOSHUA. For reentry
   into R-2515, confirm with China Control the status of Black Mountain Supersonic Corridor.
5.13. Trona Controlled Firing Area (CFA) (Fig 5. Fig 5-9
   5.13.1. Military aircraft may use the Echo Bypass to avoid the CFA. The Echo Bypass
   through the Superior Valley Tactical Training Range provides a corridor for aircraft
   transiting from R-2515 to the Echo Range and the Panamint MOA or vice versa. The
   corridor is approximately 4 NM wide and can be flown at both low and high altitudes at
   speeds below 0.9 mach. Aircraft flying low level in the bypass will not descend below
   500’AGL within 2,000’ of manned sites. Aircraft with hung or armed ordnance will not
   overfly manned sites. The width of the bypass extends from the eastern boundary of R-2524
   (W11655.3’) westward to W11700.0’. China Control controls flight through the Echo
   Bypass.
   5.13.2. Use of the Echo Bypass when the CFA is not active must be scheduled through the
   ROC. Provide call sign, type and number of aircraft, duration of use, altitude, date and time.
   5.13.3. Use caution during transit due to the proximity of the Goldstone Complex and for the
   possibility of concentrated helicopter activity along the western boundary of R-2502N.

                                    R-2515 PROCEDURES

6.1. R-2515 Airspace and SPORT Procedures. In accordance with provisions outlined in
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Joint Order (JO) 7610.4, Special Procedures, Chapter
13, Military Radar Unit Duties, Responsibilities, and Procedures, SPORT is authorized to
provide MRU Command and Control (C2) service to participating aircraft within airspace
designated to SPORT, which includes R-2515, Barstow West, and Barstow East (FL230 and
below). After coordinating with JOSHUA TRACON, SPORT may provide services anywhere
within the R-2508 Complex. SPORT does not operate remote radios and may be unable to
communicate effectively at extreme ranges or low altitudes The entire R-2508 complex, to
include R-2515, is a see-and-avoid airspace; visual lookout and mid-air collision avoidance is
primarily the aircrew’s responsibility. JOSHUA and SPORT will aid in deconfliction. Aircrews
should advise controllers prior to executing maneuvers that require rapid changes of altitude or
dynamic maneuvering (e.g. course reversal) so appropriate traffic advisories may be issued.
SPORT does not expect highly dynamic maneuvering before an aircrew reach the contracted
airspace. For example, when transiting Cords Road and the Black Mountain Super Sonic Area
toward assigned Koehn/Cuddyback airspace, SPORT should be alerted prior to performing a G
exercise.
6.2. SPORT C2 Services. Although C2 is not an air traffic control function, to support the
AFTC mission in a dynamic Special Use Airspace (SUA) environment, SPORT MRU
controllers shall provide the following C2 service functions using phraseology and techniques
found in FAA Order JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control.
   6.2.1. SPORT C2 services include:
       6.2.1.1. Radar Monitoring.
       6.2.1.2. Radar Traffic Advisories.
       6.2.1.3. Safety Alerts.
       6.2.1.4. Boundary Calls.
       6.2.1.5. Tactical Maneuvering Traffic Calls.
       6.2.1.6. Radar Vectoring.
       6.2.1.7. Issuing Flight Information.
       6.2.1.8. Arrival Sequencing.
       6.2.1.9. Deconflict Aircraft and/or Airspace.
       6.2.1.10. Issue Altitudes and/or Headings.
       6.2.1.11. Establish Aircraft on Approach.
       6.2.1.12. Control of designated airspace for special use (e.g., Spin Areas, Cords Road
       etc.) within specified altitude strata, within specified airspace blocks or geographic areas.
       6.2.1.13. Coordinating special operating requirements established by Safety Review
       Board (SRB) or other flight safety direction with SPORT for execution.
 60                                                 EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013


       6.2.1.14. Controlling airborne access into the PIRA and Alpha Corridor. The above
       services shall be accomplished in designated SUA, which SPORT has responsibility to
       ensure the safe and efficient deconfliction of airspace and aircraft as specified in FAA JO
       7610.4N. NOTE: The term(s) vector, deconflict, altitude, headings, etc., does not indicate
       the application of Air Traffic Control procedures IAW Federal Aviation Administration
       regulations.    Those terms IAW the C2 charter, indicate the prescribed procedures
       SPORT is authorized to employ to assist participating aircraft from encroaching upon
       Special Use Airspace (SUA), aircraft on converging courses, participating aircraft on test
       missions, airspace deconfliction plans or any other action(s) deemed necessary by the
       Test Wing Commander to accomplish the mission.
   6.2.2. Participating aircrews shall comply with all C2 instructions issued by SPORT. If
   unable to comply with SPORT C2 instructions, aircrews will immediately advise SPORT of
   their intentions.
6.3. Airspace Access Procedures After Take-Off.
   6.3.1. When practical on departure or RTB, avoid operations at altitudes less than 15,000’
   MSL until crossing west of a line from Mojave to Inyokern to minimize exposure to civilian
   aircraft along Hwy 14 toward Inyokern and Hwy 58 through Tehachapi or until established in
   R-2515.
6.4. R-2515 and Isabella Work Area Special Planning. R-2515 and the area within Isabella
south of a line extending from California City to 1 mile N of Tehachapi is primarily for test and
test support missions only. Other AFTC missions should avoid this area except to transit to/from
the outlying work areas. This restriction may be relaxed if test/test support activity is low. The
Aircraft Commander (AC) or designated individual must contact SPORT to coordinate a work
area or block altitude assuring no interference with test missions.
   6.4.1. Crews conducting missions within the Edwards Class D airspace (Tower Fly-by,
   airshow practice, lakebed operations, etc.) will brief the Tower supervisor prior to flight.
6.5. Altimeter Setting Within R-2515.
   6.5.1. Test aircraft may use 29.92 at all altitudes as required by test parameters within R-
   2515 in VMC. Otherwise, use the Edwards altimeter setting.
   6.5.2. Refer to paragraph 5.5 or Attachment 5 for altimeter settings outside of R-2515.
6.6. Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Procedures.
   6.6.1. When weather dictates, SPORT will coordinate with the 412 OG/CC to release a
   portion of R-2515 (e.g., Weather Area 2) to JOSHUA for IFR operations. This airspace will
   allow aircraft to climb or descend to reach VMC. Upon reaching VMC, crews shall cancel
   the IFR clearance, proceed VFR and will be issued a complex clearance from JOSHUA.
   Crews can expect a frequency change and transfer of control to SPORT.
   6.6.2. Crews returning to Edwards that encounter IMC shall remain in VMC and request a
   transfer to JOSHUA for an IFR clearance. Expect delays as SPORT coordinates for release
   of airspace to JOSHUA. After transfer of control to JOSHUA, an IFR clearance will be
   issued. Crews shall report when able to resume flight in VMC.
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                               61


       6.6.2.1. If unable to locate VMC, the crew should advise JOSHUA and return to base for
       an instrument approach.
       6.6.2.2. Upon reaching VMC the crew should cancel IFR and either proceed visually or
       continue the approach in VMC to landing. Contact Tower when instructed.
   6.6.3. If unable to locate VMC, crews should advise JOSHUA and either exit the area or
   return to base.
6.7. R-2515 Operations. SPORT in conjunction with the Airboss will determine when R-2515
is becoming unsafe due to traffic saturation. The Airboss has the authority to direct aircraft to
depart the restricted area based on priority.
   6.7.1. Test missions and other missions requiring facilities within R-2515 have the priority
   to operate within the airspace (Exception: aircraft transition to/from the Tower pattern, work
   areas or properly scheduled transit flights).
   6.7.2. Aircraft will be directed to depart R-2515 when the Airboss determines interference
   with a test mission is likely.
   6.7.3. Aircrews requiring maneuvering airspace during night/weekend flying will coordinate
   a de-confliction plan with Wing Scheduling in accordance with Attachment 7.
   6.7.4. Test or training missions with greater than 1v1 limited or unlimited maneuvering
   (ACM, Intercept, ACBT) will utilize airspace IAW Attachment 8. Test or training missions
   with more than 4 aircraft will utilize the airspace IAW Attachment 8 regardless of maneuver
   category. Test or training missions with up to 4 aircraft are excluded from these airspace
   requirements if the target maneuvers are scripted or restricted (as defined by AFI 11-214).
   The OG/CC is the waiver authority for this paragraph.
   6.7.5. Scheduled civil aircraft are permitted to transit or operate within R-2515 IAW with the
   approved Letter of Agreement (LOA) or as coordinated with 412 OSS/OSOF (661-277-
   2515). Civil aircraft responding to an emergency situation (accident, gas leak, etc) are not
   required to schedule airspace.
6.8. In-Flight Responsibilities. Aircrews will remain clear of internal R-2508 Restricted Areas
unless cleared by JOSHUA or the using agency. During radio call prior to takeoff, or in-flight,
SPORT will advise aircrews of any active airspace for special use area (e.g., Alpha Corridor,
PIRA etc.).
6.9. Cords Road Test Area. Cords Road is a true east/west oriented graded road running
across R-2515 from just north of Mojave Airport to Coyote Lake. The Cords Road test area
extends 3NM north and south of the road generally along N3505’. The road is a visual reference
for test aircraft operating in R-2515.
6.10. SPIN AREAS. (Fig 6.1.) North/South/East/West and Lakebed Spin Areas are 5 NMs in
diameter, and normally extend from 11,000' MSL to 45,000’ MSL except for the Lakebed spin
area which extends from 6,000 MSL to 45,000’ MSL.
   6.10.1. The Mercury Spin Area is defined as follows: The northern boundary is a west-east
   line that is 5.8 miles south of Cords roads (35 0’2.000” N 117 37’ 0.000” W, 35 0’ 0.00”
   N/117 32’ 37.469” W). The Eastern boundary follows Hwy 395 southbound and then
   westward through the southeast corner of the East Range, then south to follow the southern

  edge of R-2515 (34 50’ 39.174” N/117 30’ 1.902” W, 34 50’20.000” N/117 32’ 2.993” W,
  34 48’ 30.000” N/117 32’ 3.000” W, 34 48’ 0.000” N/117 35’ 30.000” W, 34 48” 3.000”
  N/117 49” 54.000” W). The western boundary is a south-north line that follows Mercury
  Blvd to the point of beginning (34 54’ 2.000” N/117 47’ 47.000” W, 34 54’ 34.000” N/117
  47’ 27.000” W). The area extends from 11,000 MSL to FL450.
  6.10.2. Procedures:
         6.10.2.1. SPORT exercises positive control over the Spin Areas and provides
         advisory service to aircraft operating within or maneuvering to the Spin Areas.
     6.10.2.2. Do not schedule the North Spin for simultaneous operation with Cords Road.
     Use simultaneous operations procedures to resolve conflicts.
     6.10.2.3. Aircraft will avoid active spin areas but may operate unrestricted below the
     lowest active altitude.
     6.10.2.4. Tower and SPORT will announce the area “hot” on common frequencies.
     Depending on the base altitude, Shuttle, Low L/D or Simulated Flame-Out (SFO)
     approaches are not authorized.
     6.10.2.5. The Mercury Spin Area shall not be used simultaneously with active
     East/South Spin areas.
     6.10.2.6. Coordinate with SPORT for use of the Buckhorn MOA if additional
     maneuvering airspace is required
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                             63

6.11. Drop Zones. (Fig 6.2., Attachment 4 items 198 to 201)
   6.11.1. The Survival School DZ, authorized for personnel drops only, is a 600 square yard
   area with an avoidance radius of 1.5 miles from the DZ center, surface to 500’ above the
   active altitude. This area extends east and west along the entire south lakeshore of Rogers
   Dry Lake. On the north, the DZ is bordered by the intersection of Lakebed Rwys 7/25 and
   17/35 and on the south by Avenue (Ave) B, about 1/2 mile south of the sled track. NOTE:
   Although the Alpha Corridor is closed to all VFR traffic when the DZ is active, the PIRA and
   portions of the Alpha Corridor may be used by other controlled traffic concurrently with the
   DZ provided the 1-1/2 mile avoidance area is protected surface to 500' above the active
   altitude.
   6.11.2. The Farm Circular DZ is an Air Mobility Command (AMC) certified DZ authorized
   for cargo and personnel drops. The Camacho DZ, a rectangular plowed area, is roughly
   centered and contained within the limits of the Farm Circular DZ. The DZ is located in the
   Buckhorn MOA west of Lancaster Blvd. SPORT provides radar monitoring and has final
   approval authority for concurrent operations between the Farm DZ and the
   Lancaster/Buckhorn routings.

Figure 6.2. Edwards Drop Zones




      6.11.2.1. The Buckhorn MOA is scheduled and activated when in use. Schedule the
      Alpha Corridor for de-confliction purposes in Common Scheduling Enterprise (CSE).
      6.11.2.2. Crews flying the Lancaster or Buckhorn routings must adhere to the published
      procedures.
   6.11.3. The Housing DZ, authorized for personnel drops only, is located north of base
   housing approximately 3.5 miles south of Hwy 58 and includes an avoidance area radius of
   1.5 miles from the DZ center or 500’ above the drop altitude when active. Operations will
   not be scheduled above 13,000' MSL nor activated higher than 5,000' above the highest drop
   altitude.
      6.11.3.1. Edwards Tower, SPORT and the DZ Controller coordinate each drop. A 3-
      minute (min) call precedes each drop (e.g., "3 minutes to drop"). Tower activates the DZ
      with SPORT and in turn, SPORT notifies affected aircraft of the DZ status.
      6.11.3.2. The DZ is limited to non-static line drops only with all release points inside the
      1-1/2 mile avoidance area. Joint operations require prior coordination.
   6.11.4. The Enad DZ, a certified AMC DZ located on Rosamond Lakebed southwest (SW)
   of the approach end of Rwy 29, is authorized for cargo and personnel drops. Schedule the
   Alpha Corridor/Buckhorn for deconfliction. SPORT advises Tower when the DZ is active.
   6.11.5. Simultaneous Operations (Farm, ENAD or Survival School DZ):
      6.11.5.1. When a scheduled drop mission is in standby to another range mission, the
      mission jumpmaster may coordinate for simultaneous operations. Critically analyze the
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                   65


       proximity of the DZ to activity in West Range prior to agreeing to conduct simultaneous
       operations. If simultaneous operations at either DZ cannot be agreed upon, move the
       parachute mission to the Housing Area DZ.
       6.11.5.2. The jump aircraft’s crew will contact SPORT on mission frequency prior to
       departure and request clearance into the Alpha Corridor to conduct parachute operations.
       Advise SPORT of coordination with conflicting mission crew and agreement to conduct
       simultaneous operations when applicable.
       6.11.5.3. The SPORT controller may hold the jump aircraft on the ground, at a specific
       altitude, delay a jump or cancel the mission as required for safety.
       6.11.5.4. The jump aircraft must receive SPORT clearance before liftoff from the
       Survival School only. Prior to each liftoff, the crew briefs SPORT on the profile.
       6.11.5.5. Make timing calls to the DZ Controller (3 mins, 2 mins and 1 min, etc.). At the
       1 min mark, the crew must request clearance from the DZ Controller and SPORT to
       proceed with the jump.
       6.11.5.6. At any time during the mission, the SPORT controller, crew, mission
       jumpmaster or the crew of the higher priority mission may call off the jump mission for
       safety reasons.
       6.11.5.7. SPORT exercises control over airborne operations only and not over
       simultaneous ground operations at the FARM DZ. Clearance for simultaneous operations
       must come from a ground safety representative physically present at the drop site.
6.12. UAS Corridor. (Fig 6.3.) The UAS Corridor shall only be used to transit above Class D
airspace between the Work Area and PIRA. Transit altitude will be 5,000 feet MSL and above.
6.13. UAS Work Area. (Fig 6.3.) This area extends from the surface to 10,000 feet MSL.
Tower shall coordinate transfer control of the UAS Work Area to SPORT as required.
   6.13.1. The UAS mission assumes all responsibility for flight activity within this airspace.
   6.13.2. The UAS mission shall maintain 2-way radio communications with Tower/SPORT.
   6.13.3. SPORT shall notify Tower of any boundary violations.
   6.13.4. When active, Lakebed SPIN area along with IFR instrument approaches to EDW
   main base are not authorized.
   6.13.5. The UAS Project Manager shall coordinate with North Base to de-conflict

   7.3.1. Takeoffs. Aircraft may depart from lakebed runways when the main runways are
   unavailable, the flight is mission essential, and the 412 OG/CC approves. The following
   procedures apply to all aircraft with the exception of C-12s (see 7.3.7. for C-12 procedures):
       7.3.1.1. Make pre-takeoff engine checks on a hard surface area before taxiing onto the
       lakebed. Limit afterburner takeoff unless essential for safety or required by the aircraft
       flight manual to prevent lakebed damage.
       7.3.1.2. Obtain Tower approval to enter the lakebed.
       7.3.1.3. Lakebed intersection departures are not authorized. The runways have no
       distance remaining markers and any variation requires approval from the 412 OG/CC.
   7.3.2. Landings. Practice full-stop lakebed landings from the hours of sunrise to sunset
   during VMC conditions are authorized for locally operated aircraft and local aircrew.
       7.3.2.1. Touch-and-go landings are not authorized. Low approaches to Green or Yellow
       lakebed runways are authorized when approved by Tower. Low approaches to Red
       lakebed runways must be authorized by 412 OG/CC.
          7.3.2.1.1. T-38 and F-16 Lakebed landings for training or proficiency require unit
          operations officer approval.
          7.3.2.1.2. Aircrew will ensure that lakebed landings performed for training or
          proficiency in the T-38 or F-16 are coordinated with the their unit scheduling shop
          NLT 1100 local the day prior to the intended lakebed landing. Unit schedulers will

                                              recommended.
 NOTE 1: Landing on a Yellow lakebed runway may cause that runway to be labeled Red for
 an extended period of time due to lakebed damage attributed to the landing.

 NOTE 2: When landing on other than a Green lakebed runway or lakebed runways that are
 not clearly visible from the Tower, pilots should expect to hear “landing will be at your own
 risk” phraseology vice “cleared to land”.

   7.3.5. Lakebed Runways. The lakebed runways are available for use when dry and free of
   potholes and other hazards. Monday through Friday inspections assure maintainability. A
   color coding system reflects the lakebed runway condition/usability (Table 7.1.).
   7.3.6. Periodically EAFB lacks a green or yellow lakebed runway that faces the prevailing
   wind. There are large sections of lakebed runways that are free of potholes and other
 78                                                  EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013


   obstacles, but are labeled red because the entire length is not deemed safe. When a lakebed
   runway facing the prevailing wind is unavailable for a long period of time, the 412 OG/CC
   can authorize the use of sectioned lakebed runways. This would allow the recovery of
   emergency aircraft on the lakebed without a high crosswind component.
       7.3.6.1. The beginning and end of the usable landing area will be marked by two salmon
       colored Visual Assault Zone Marking Panels (VAMPs) on either side of the
       runway. When the sectioned runway is declared yellow the distance between the VAMPs
       will be opened for emergency use only.
       7.3.6.2. COOL will reflect the usable section on the EDW: Airfield Runway Status
       page. For example, COOL may report: "23R/05L [See Notes]" where the [See Notes]
       brick is colored yellow. The notes section will read, for example, "23R/05L Sectioned
       Runway has approximately 7,000 ft between the VAMPs." Note that the runway status
       will never be better than yellow as it is for emergency use only. However, low
       approaches are allowed.
       7.3.6.3. The VAMPs are visible out to about a 1-2 nm final if their location is known.
       Crews are encouraged to locate them visually during normal pattern operations, by
       orbiting over the lakebed, etc. It is possible that airfield management will move the
       VAMPs slightly as the lakebed runway conditions change. Occasionally checking the
       location of the VAMPs will ensure aircrew know where to look for them when needed.
       7.3.6.4. As lakebed conditions change the VAMP location may change, the sectioned
       runway may be removed, or another runway may be designated as a sectioned runway.
       Each change will be preceded by an FCIF.
   7.3.7. C-12s Austere Operations: C-12s may use lakebed runways for austere operations
   regardless of the status of the main runways and will comply with the following procedures:
       7.3.7.1. Due to lack of runway remaining markers initial lakebed takeoffs must use the
       full length.
       7.3.7.2. Normally accomplish lakebed takeoffs after a lakebed full stop landing. On
       approach the IP will determine the amount of back taxi (if any) that is required to ensure
       all obstacles are cleared and that runway remaining exceeds the greater of 4000’,
       computed Accel After Liftoff to 50 feet (Accel Go), or Accel Stop computed without
       reverse plus 500 feet.
       7.3.7.3. On lakebeds directed towards the main base no takeoffs will be initiated past the
       intersection with lakebed runway 33/15.
       7.3.7.4. Each lakebed takeoff and landing sortie will be expressly annotated as such on
       the schedule.
7.4. Aircraft Priorities. Tower provides air traffic control services to aircraft on a “first-come,
first-serve” basis as circumstances warrant. Due to special handling requirements, the following
priorities apply in order as specified in Table 7.2. This listing does not supersede the Operational
Priorities listed in FAA Order JO 7110.65.

7.5. Priority Alpha Designation. Priority Alpha is a priority traffic movement designator used
by all AFTC flying organizations and other agencies using Edwards’ facilities. Priority Alpha
notifies Tower of possible loss of mission due to takeoff or landing clearance delays.
   7.5.1. Consistent with FAA regulations and safety, Tower affords priority to Priority Alpha
   aircraft except as listed in Table 7.2. To be effective, this procedure requires discretion by all
   crew members and briefing officers.
   7.5.2. Missions identified in Table 7.3. may declare Priority Alpha when it is essential for
   successful mission completion.
   7.5.3. Declare Priority Alpha as follows:
       7.5.3.1. Departures. Notify Ground of required takeoff time upon request for taxi
       instructions (Example: "Edwards Ground, Cobra 17, request Priority Alpha for a One
       Four Three Three Zulu (1433Z) scheduled departure"). Update any changes to required
       takeoff time as soon as possible.

 Performance takeoff or landing tests when gross weight, center of gravity, runway condition,
 etc. are factors critical to mission completion.
 Refused takeoff tests when gross weight, center of gravity, runway condition, etc. are factors
 critical to mission completion.
 Takeoff or landing when the crew is wearing pressure suits.
 Missions that require a time critical intercept/tanker rendezvous.
 Test missions with critical range time.

       7.5.3.2. Arrivals. Notify Tower on initial contact of the requirement for uninterrupted
       approaches for data collection (Example: “Edwards Tower, Torch 41, 4 miles northeast
       of the mines, request Priority Alpha straight in, touch-and-go, stay with Tower").
7.6. Functional Check Flights (FCF). Use of R-2515 is authorized. FCFs may use designated
Edwards supersonic corridors. FCFs must be coordinated through SPORT airspace.
7.7. Palmdale Corridor (Fig 7. 3.) The Palmdale Corridor is activated on an as-needed basis
for Non-participant IFR arrivals/departures. The corridor’s dimensions were designed to reduce

impacts on special use airspace while operating within R-2515. The dimensions are: surface to
8,000’ MSL and the width of the Class Delta with extensions ending at the southern boundary of
the R-2515. Participating aircraft shall enter/exit the Class D surface area laterally, at or below
4,800’ MSL when the Palmdale Corridor is active.
   7.7.1. SPORT MRU will advise when the airspace is activated and provide information to
   affected aircraft to remain outside the confines of the Palmdale Corridor. The altitude
   released for corridor operations may be less than the 8,000’ MSL ceiling.

7.8. (SOF) /Tower Operations.
   7.8.1. The SOF, callsign PONDEROSA 8, is the direct representative of the OG. In this
   capacity, the SOF provides real-time oversight of flying operations and is a primary source of
   assistance to aircrews. Decision authority is delegated to this position to accomplish the 412
   TW mission. SOF responsibilities are detailed in AFMCI 11-201 Supervision of Flight
   Operations.
7.8.2. The SOF shall inform the Tower Watch Supervisor (WS) of operational concerns and if
an immediate hazard to flight safety exists.The Tower Watch Supervisor has sole authority to
direct Tower operations. All coordination shall be accomplished via the Watch Supervisor. The
WS shall notify the SOF when circumstances/activities occur that will impact aircraft operations.
   7.8.2.1. Normal aircrew to SOF communication shall be on 308.7 and VHF 143.725. The
   WS shall ensure a GRC 171 is set to the appropriate frequency for SOF use. Upon request,
   other frequencies may be available to the SOF on multi-channel back-up radios. The WS
   shall ensure operational checks are completed prior to opening the Tower. If normal
   communication on SOF frequency is not possible for any reason, the SOF must coordinate
   with the WS prior to transmitting to the affected aircraft directly on Tower frequencies.
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                               81


   7.8.3. The SOF shall notify the WS and command post if performing SOF duties in a
   location other than the Tower. If the SOF is not in the Tower or the SOF vehicle when a
   pilot requests SOF assistance or when the first AFTC fighter/trainer aircraft calls for taxi,
   Tower personnel will contact Command Post to verify if SOF is enroute or working out of a
   unit. Tower will not issue take-off clearance for 412 TW fighter/trainer aircraft without a
   SOF on duty in the SOF vehicle, in the Tower or at the unit, unless specifically approved by
   the 412 OG/CC.
7.9. Alternate Control Tower Operations.
   7.9.1. If controllers are required to evacuate the Tower they activate the alternate control
   Tower atop Fire Station One located adjacent to the Tower. The following actions are
   necessary to continue air traffic control service:
      7.9.1.1. Tower shall make a blanket broadcast on all frequencies including guard, stating:
      "Attention all aircraft, Edwards Tower is being evacuated. All airborne aircraft contact
      SPORT/JOSHUA. All aircraft on the ground remain off the active runway and taxiways
      until further advised." Additionally, Tower shall make a similar broadcast on the FM
      Nets: Crash Net / Trunk Net
      7.9.1.2. Airfield lighting will be set to appropriate setting for the conditions at the
      airfield.
      7.9.1.3. Tower will recall airfield lighting standby personnel to be dispatched to the
      airfield lighting vault for the duration of alternate Tower operations.
      7.9.1.4. SFO, lifting body, and shuttle approaches will be terminated.
      7.9.1.5. Arrivals and departures to both main base runways will be suspended until the
      alternate control tower is activated.
      7.9.1.6. Vehicle entry into the movement area and vehicle runway crossings will be
      suspended until operations are re-established.
   7.9.2. Operations to North Base and South Base will not be affected.
   7.9.3. The following radio frequencies are available in the alternate tower:
      7.9.3.1. Tower: 318.1 / 120.7
      7.9.3.2. Ground: 225.4 / 121.8
      7.9.3.3. Emergency: 243.0 / 121.5
      7.9.3.4. DELETED
      7.9.3.5. FM Nets: Crash Net / Trunk Net (available via LMR only)
   7.9.4. The alternate tower has limited recording capability (frequencies/FM Nets) as long as
   the DVRS in the primary tower is operational.
   7.9.5. CONUS Remote Maintenance Center (RMC), located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma,
   will provide remote monitoring of NAVAIDS.
   7.9.6. After locating to the alternate tower and controllers are ready to resume operations
   tower will make a blanket broadcast on all frequencies, ramp nets: "Attention all aircraft and
   personnel, Edwards alternate tower is now operational."

  7.9.7. When the alternate tower is in use no shuttle, lifting body, or practice SFO approaches
  may be flown due to the lack of a radar display. Only full stops landings are permitted.
  7.9.8. Lakebed Operations. Lakebed runways are not visible from the Tower. Aircraft
  landing or departing lakebed runways shall be issued the following: “LAKEBED RUNWAY
  (NUMBER) NOT VISIBLE FROM THE TOWER, LANDING/DEPARTURE WILL BE AT
  YOUR OWN RISK”.
  7.9.9. Control tower management, after assessing capabilities, will coordinate with the 412
  OG/CC to determine any increase in volume of aircraft operations the alternate tower may
  support to the main base runway.

8.1. VFR Traffic Patterns.
   8.1.1. Priority. Aircraft in distress have the right of way over all other air traffic. Lakebeds
   may be used in an emergency regardless of condition. However, if time permits, the SOF
   will recommend a landing area commensurate with the type of emergency.
   8.1.2. Pilots will advise Tower on initial contact of type approach, landing and if required,
   intentions to follow.
      8.1.2.1. 360-Overhead pattern protection. All aircraft will remain below 3300’ MSL
      until past the departure end of the runway.
   8.1.3. Traffic Sequencing. Tower will issue appropriate instructions when re-sequencing is
   required. Aircrews will not deviate from the pattern procedures described in this paragraph
   unless authorized or instructed by the Tower, or as required for safety of flight.
   8.1.4. Traffic Pattern Procedures. Edwards AFB traffic patterns are described in Table 8.1.
   NOTE: Aircraft temporarily assigned to and using AFTC call signs may conduct approaches
   IAW these procedures. If flying aircraft different from the host flying unit, aircraft
   characteristics (speeds, altitudes, special handling requirements) must be provided to the
   Tower at least 72 hours in advance for controller training. Weather minimums for patterns
   to be opened are as follows:
      8.1.4.1. Helicopter/South Base – 3,300/3 NM
      8.1.4.2. Closed Other Aircraft/Straight In – 3,800/3 NM
      8.1.4.3. Closed Fighter/Trainer – 4,300/3 NM
      8.1.4.4. Overhead – 4,300/3 NM
      8.1.4.5. Re-entry – 4,800/3 NM
      8.1.4.6. Simulated Flame Out/Shuttle Approach/Lifting Body – 1,000 feet above highest
      altitude flown and 5 miles visibility.

  8.1.5. Activity on Rwy 22R/04L will be conducted IAW paragraph 4.2.4.
  8.1.6. Tactical (TAC) Initial. Use caution when conducting TAC Initial formations
  simultaneously with tower fly-by-line operations and shuttle L/D approaches due to offset of
  the overhead approach procedures. Fighter aircraft will adhere to the following procedures
  when performing a TAC Initial:
     8.1.6.1. On initial contact with Edwards Tower, flight leads may request a “TAC Initial”.
     Pattern traffic and weather should be taken into consideration before making the request
     with Tower. Tower is the final approval authority.
     8.1.6.2. Flights will enter at the VFR entry point at 350 Knots Calibrated Airspeed
     (KCAS). The flight lead shall fly the ground track of the normal Edwards AFB initial
     pattern for the active runway. Wingmen will fly line abreast with 3000’ offset opposite
     the direction of break. Additional elements will be established in no more than 1 NM
     trail. Flights will provide their own separation during the break maneuver.
     Flights/elements will break to arrive on downwind with normal overhead pattern spacing.
  8.1.7. Tower Flyby Pattern (Fig 8.4.). The Tower Flyby Pattern is a procedure for aircraft
  speed and altitude calibration. The ground track is similar to the North Reentry pattern for
  Rwy 22. The “Final” portion of the pattern follows a ground track parallel to and just north
  of the extended centerline of Rwy 04/22 starting at the northeast edge of Rogers Lakebed
  terminating near Taxiway Alpha. Pattern alignment markers are on the lakebed between the
  flyby tower and the east shoreline. NOTE: Multiple aircraft formations (two or more) are
  not authorized flyby line operations unless specific test requirements exist and are approved.
  Expect aircraft overflights at or above 3,300' MSL between the tower flyby final and the flyby
  tower. Be alert for opposite direction traffic when Rwy 4 is active.
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                            91


     8.1.7.1. The entire pattern is approximately 4NM wide and 8NM long. The crosswind
     portion follows a ground track to the west of the base housing area and landfill. The
     downwind leg is flown to remain north of North Base and the city of North Edwards.
     8.1.7.2. Tower Flyby final will be flown east to west with a right-hand turn to crosswind
     and base leg regardless of the active runway.
     8.1.7.3. Procedures. Contact Tower for clearance before entering the Tower Flyby
     pattern. Maintain communications with the Tower while in the pattern and make radio
     calls at the positions depicted in the figure. Advise Tower on downwind leg of last
     pattern and intentions to follow. Abort the procedure if communications with Tower are
     lost.
        8.1.7.3.1. Crews may enter the Tower Flyby pattern from the Rwy 22 departure leg
        by turning crosswind. Aircraft outside the main base traffic pattern may coordinate
        with Tower to enter the Tower Flyby pattern on downwind, base, or final.
        8.1.7.3.2. Downwind leg will be flown at 3500’ MSL. Crew may descend after
        starting the turn to base leg, but will not descend below 500’ AGL until crossing Hwy
        58. Do not descend below 200’ AGL until established on final and remain below
        2800’ MSL on final until abeam the flyby tower.
        8.1.7.3.3. Airspeed on downwind will be 250-350 KIAS as mission requirements
        dictate. Aircraft on final will remain below Mach 1. Maximum speed will be 450
        KIAS unless part of an approved test plan or curriculum.
        8.1.7.3.4. Light aircraft may turn early to crosswind between Main Base and Base
        Housing. This ground track is depicted in Fig 8.4. as the cross-hatched area. Advise
        Tower when making short turnout. Do not turn early to crosswind if carrying
        external stores other than fuel tanks.
        8.1.7.3.5. For slow-speed patterns, the downwind and base leg groundtracks can be
        modified to remain south of the North Base complex and turn base leg over Rodgers
        Lakebed (light aircraft only).
        8.1.7.3.6. For high-speed patterns, the downwind leg may be extended. Advise
        Tower before extending downwind and use caution for light aircraft along Hwy 58.
        Maintain a standard rectangular pattern groundtrack and turn to base leg at or before
        reaching the VORTAC.
        8.1.7.3.7. Tower will hold all taxiing aircraft short of the Flyby Line at taxiway
        Charlie once the Flyby aircraft reports “Final, Tower Flyby”. Advise Tower on
        downwind leg of last pattern and intentions to follow. Immediately after passing the
        fly-by tower, climb to 3,300' MSL and fly runway heading until Tower approves
        crosswind/closed traffic or as instructed by Tower.
        8.1.7.3.8. Aircraft other than AFTC/DFRC assigned require 412 OG/CC approval to
        utilize the tower flyby. On initial contact with SPORT or Tower, advise them of this
        approval.
        8.1.7.3.9. A Pacer Fly-By mission requires a FOD check after departure/landing and
        should be issued a discrete mission frequency that will be monitored by Tower.

   8.1.8. North Base Operations. (Fig 8.1.) Traffic Pattern. Conventional/North Base Runway
   06/24. A 45° entry to a downwind leg north and parallel to Rwy 06/24. Pattern altitude is
   2,800' MSL.
      8.1.8.1. All operations requiring use of the North Base Runway require the approval of
      the 412 OG/CC. Turns are only authorized on the concrete portions of the runway
      (located at midfield and runway ends). Test missions using North Base will schedule
      Crash/Fire/Rescue support IAW AFFTCI 11-115, Scheduling Procedures for Aircraft and
      Air/Ground Support.
      8.1.8.2. Tower provides advisory services only. Since the runway environment is not
      visible from the Tower, crews are responsible for providing separation from other
      aircraft.
      8.1.8.3. Departures. Prior to taxi, obtain ATIS. North Base Runway in use is
      determined by runway in use at Main Base (i.e. Main Base Rwy 22 - North Base Rwy
      24). Contact Ground Control when ready to taxi. Contact Tower prior to entering the
      runway. Crew will be instructed to report airborne (takeoff clearance will not be issued)
      and will receive traffic advisories.

      8.1.8.4. Arrivals. Prior to entering Class D airspace, contact Tower for landing
      instructions with callsign and position. Tower transmits Main Base wind and runway in
      use, altimeter, and desired reporting point. Crew will be issued traffic advisories and
      instructed to report off the runway. North Base lights will only be operated for an arrival
      or departure.
   8.1.9. South Base Operations (Fig 8.1.) Traffic Pattern. A 45° entry to downwind. Pattern
   altitude 2,800’ MSL. Left traffic for Rwy 24. Right Traffic for Rwy 06. Overhead patterns
   are not authorized. Takeoffs/landings at South Base are only authorized on the center 50’
   keel of the runway. Runway has standard “basic runway” markings (w/o lights and distance
   remaining markers). Runway is limited to BE20 type aircraft and smaller weighing 12,500
   pounds or less.
      8.1.9.1. Tower provides advisory services only. The runway environment is not visible
      from the Tower therefore crews are responsible for providing separation from other
      aircraft. If the Alpha Corridor is active, use the Rosamond or Alternate Hwy 58 East
      routes.
      8.1.9.2. Departures. Prior to taxi, obtain ATIS. South Base runway in use is determined
      by runway in use at Main Base (i.e. Main Base Rwy 22 - South Base Rwy 24). Contact
      Ground Control when ready to taxi. Contact Tower prior to entering the runway. Pilots
      will be instructed to report airborne (takeoff clearance will not be issued) and will be
      afforded traffic advisories. Tower approves a departure from the pattern and specifies the
      route to fly consistent with the status of active areas. When Rwy 04 is in use, Rosamond
      departures from Rwy 06 will proceed via General’s Hill direct Buckhorn Lakebed.
      8.1.9.3. Arrivals: Prior to entering Class D airspace, contact Tower for landing
      instructions with call sign and position. Crew will be provided traffic advisories and
      instructed to report off the runway. When Main Base Rwy 04 is in use, arrivals will
      proceed to South base via Buckhorn Lakebed direct General’s Hill.
      8.1.9.4. Tower transmits Main Base wind, South Base runway in use, altimeter, known
      traffic, issues route of flight consistent with the status of active areas and specifies an
      appropriate reporting point (except when SPORT is open): Lancaster arrival – before
      entering downwind; Rosamond arrival – Bend-in-the-Road. Obtain Tower approval
      before crossing the extended centerline of Rwy 04. Cross at least three (3) miles from the
      approach end of Rwy 04, below 500' AGL.
8.2. Reduced Same Runway Separation Standards (RSRS). AFMC RSRS is authorized for
Rwy 04R/22L and 04L/22R.
   8.2.1. RSRS (Tables 8.2. and 8.3.) may be applied between AFMC aircraft, aircraft assigned
   to Dryden Flight Research Facility and other aircraft as specified in AFI 13-204v3 AFMC
   SUP 1.
   8.2.2. Temporarily assigned aircraft supporting flight testing or other Non-AFMC aircraft
   not specified in the AFI 13-204v3 AFMC SUP1 are not authorized RSRS unless covered by
   an LOA.

8.3. Intersection Departures (Fig 8.5.). Due to the limited number of taxi routes available for
arriving aircraft, intersection departures may experience delays for arriving aircraft taxiing from
the main runway. Initiate intersection departure request with Ground Control upon initial
contact.     Intersection departures are not authorized for base assigned tactical/fighter,
trainer/attack type aircraft such as F-16, F-22, F-35 or T-38.

Figure 8.5. Runway 4-22 Intersection Departures




8.4. Circling Approaches. Circling approaches to Rwy 04R/22L or 04L/22R are not authorized
when there are aircraft in the South Base traffic pattern due to potential traffic conflicts and/or
wake turbulence hazards. Advise the Tower prior to entering Class D airspace to allow time to
terminate South Base operations.
8.5. Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC).
   8.5.1. Departures. Crews will request an IFR clearance from ground control when departing
   during IMC. JOSHUA will issue the clearance and obtain a portion of R-2515 from SPORT
   to allow IFR operations within R-2515. This airspace will only be obtained to allow an
   aircraft to climb through the clouds/weather to reach VMC. Advise Tower one minute prior
   to departure for climbout instructions.
   8.5.2. Upon reaching VMC crews shall cancel the IFR clearance with JOSHUA and resume
   VFR operations. JOSHUA will issue a complex clearance and accomplish a data transfer to
   SPORT, if applicable.
8.6. Radar Traffic Patterns. When required, radar traffic patterns are located 6-10 miles
northwest of Runway 04R/22L. Downwind is normally flown at 5,000’ MSL. The normal radar
traffic patterns are:
   8.6.1. Runway 22L: Right rectangular pattern.
   8.6.2. Runway 04R: Left rectangular pattern.
   8.6.3. SPORT MRU will not provide radar vectors to initial.

8.7. Successive Instrument Approaches. Crews are highly encouraged to complete
proficiency requirements off-station. Due to the high volume of test mission activity, Palmdale
is the primary airfield for all aircraft requesting multiple, practice instrument approaches.
8.8. Local Climb-Out. Local climb-out instructions for Rwy 04R/22L are “Maintain at or
below 3,300’ MSL until departure end of the runway, fly runway heading, climb and maintain
5,000’ MSL.” Locally assigned aircraft will be issued “Execute local climb-out” unless traffic
conditions dictate otherwise.
8.9. Go Around/Missed Approach Procedures. For Runway 04R/22L or 04L/22R, maintain
at or below 3,300’ MSL until departure end of the runway, fly runway heading then climb and
maintain 5,000’ MSL. Offset as required so as not to directly overfly personnel or equipment on
the runway. Alternatively maintain at least 500’ AGL (1,000’ AGL for heavy aircraft) vertical
separation when over flying personnel or equipment on the runway.
8.10. Aero Club Operations. The primary departure/landing surface is South Base Runway
06/24.
   8.10.1. Use of main base and lakebeds is for official use only.
   8.10.2. Tower must be open to use Main Base and/or lakebed runways.
   8.10.3. If an Aero Club aircraft becomes NORDO within the Class D airspace, continue on
   the arrival routing and enter the traffic pattern for the runway in use at South Base.
   8.10.4. Lakebed procedures:
       8.10.4.1. Green lakebed operations are authorized IAW applicable Aero Club Operating
       Instructions and during airfield operating hours.
       8.10.4.2. Lakebed operations shall be on a non-interference basis as coordinated with the
       Airfield Manager.
8.11. Opposite Direction Operations. Opposite direction traffic is not authorized when the
Tower radar display is out-of-service. JOSHUA will participate in opposite direction operations
in accordance with the procedures outlined below. Opposite direction operations are also
authorized when SPORT is operational. When necessary for coordination between Tower and
SPORT the phrase “Opposite direction departure/arrival, Runway (Number)” will be used.
   8.11.1. Opposite direction takeoff/landing is authorized as listed in Table 8.4. The Tower
   Flyby Line is not considered opposite direction traffic during Rwy 04R operations.

 100                                                 EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013


       8.11.2.1. IFR aircraft. (VFR aircraft using IFR procedures will also use these separation
       criteria.)
           8.11.2.1.1. Arrival vs. Arrival - the succeeding arrival is 10 flying miles from the
           runway after the preceding opposite direction arrival has crossed the landing
           threshold for a full stop.
           8.11.2.1.2. Arrival vs. Departure and vice versa - the departing aircraft is airborne
           and has turned on a diverging course prior to the arriving aircraft reaching 10 flying
           miles from the runway.
       8.11.2.2. VFR aircraft. Aircraft are handled on a case-by-case basis depending on
       existing traffic. Cutoff points for arriving aircraft are Buckhorn Lake for Rwy 4 and East
       Lake Shore for Rwy 22 (preceding opposite direction arriving aircraft has crossed the
       landing threshold for a full stop or opposite direction departing aircraft has turned on a
       diverging course).
8.12. F-16 Air Start Procedures. The F-16 Combined Test Force (CTF) must accomplish
airborne engine shut-down and restart maneuvers (air starts) requiring a sterile approach corridor
and runway environment in the event the engine fails to restart. The aircraft’s Emergency Power
Unit (EPU) will be intentionally activated. This may result in the inability of the test aircraft to
communicate and squawk Mode 3/C while the engine is shut down.
   8.12.1. Shut-downs originate in the vicinity of the Boron Mines (Rwy 22L) or Rosamond
   Lakebed (Rwy 04R) from an altitude of FL200 to FL250. In the event the engine does not
   restart, the maneuver will terminate in either a straight-in or overhead Flame Out approach to
   Rwy 04R/22L (primary) or a green lakebed runway (secondary).
   8.12.2. The crew will ensure the sortie is scheduled in CSE as an air start mission. As a
   minimum, contact the ROC, SOF, Tower and SPORT via landline to brief the mission before
   departure to include land time and recovery location. If information changes, crew/Tower
   will ensure the ROC is notified prior to landing.
   8.12.3. The crew and appropriate monitoring agency (Tower or SPORT) will utilize a
   discrete frequency throughout the mission.
   8.12.4. The standard pattern is a racetrack west of the field.
   8.12.5. Terminate full-stop landings and touch-and-go approaches (low approaches
   authorized) and departures once the Tower has approved shut down (“Cleared Shutdown”).
   The runway should be kept clear of all traffic between the “Cleared Shutdown” and “Restart”
   calls. Tower resumes normal operations after the pilot reports “Restart.” The time between
   “Cleared Shutdown” and “Restart” is normally 1 minute or less.
   8.12.6. While conducting air start missions, Tower will broadcast on common frequencies,
   to include Ground Control frequencies, "air starts in progress" on an as needed basis to alert
   other crews as to the reason for issuing a low approach or hold short instruction.
   8.12.7. The following radio calls are mandatory:
       8.12.7.1. F-16 Airstarts. Crew will report "(Callsign) one minute to shutdown". This
       advisory call allows Tower to assess the traffic situation. If a potential conflict exists,
       Tower will disapprove the request (“Unable Shutdown”). If not cleared to shutdown the
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                  101


       pilot will orbit (one turn) at current position then report “(Callsign) one minute to
       shutdown.” Once cleared for shutdown Tower will announce “Cleared shutdown.” The
       crew is not required to acknowledge Tower’s “Cleared Shutdown” call. When ready to
       RTB, the crew shall call the CONFORM (ROC) and update the land time to ensure
       proper recovery personnel are present. An IFE will not be declared for scheduled EPU
       activation unless a subsequent leak is detected.
       8.12.7.2. F-35 Airstarts. The pilot will report “(Callsign) two minutes to shutdown.”
       Tower will acknowledge the two minute call with “Tower copies, (Callsign) two minutes
       to shutdown.” This advisory call allows Tower to assess the traffic situation. The pilot
       will then report “(Callsign) one minute to shutdown.” If there are no potential conflicts,
       Tower will acknowledge the one minute call with “Airstart approved.” If a potential
       conflict exists, Tower will disapprove the request “Unable airstart.” The pilot and
       SPORT will acknowledge Tower’s shutdown disapproval. The pilot will orbit/hold (one
       turn) at the current position and then report “(Callsign) one minute to shutdown”
       following the turn in holding.
       8.12.7.3. Upon successful restart, the crew will broadcast “(Callsign) restart”. Tower
       will acknowledge the restart call and resume normal traffic pattern procedures.
   8.12.8. If the aircraft doesn’t have a successful restart, the pilot will call initiate a flameout
   landing from a high key position. The flameout pattern will normally be flown to the
   currently active runway. The pilot will inform Tower if the intended landing runway
   changes. Tower will activate the Primary Crash Phone and declare an IFE.
8.13. Global Hawk Operations.
   8.13.1. Departure.
       8.13.1.1. Tower will restrict operations south of the respective Rwy 22L/R centerline
       until Global Hawk has climbed above the Class D airspace.
       8.13.1.2. SFO (both Straight-in and Overhead), L/D and Shuttle approaches will be
       restricted until Global Hawk has passed east of the VORTAC.
       8.13.1.3. Tower will coordinate the departure release with SPORT when the Alpha
       Corridor is active.
   8.13.2. Arrival.
       8.13.2.1. Operations south of the respective Rwy 22L/R centerline, to include SFO, L/D
       and Shuttle approaches are not authorized when Global Hawk reaches the VORTAC until
       it has landed.
       8.13.2.2. North patterns and straight-in approaches are authorized during routine Global
       Hawk operations.
8.14. Night Vision Device (NVD) Operations. For operations within the Class D, NVD
operations require 24 hour prior notification and a NOTAM shall be issued. Crews will notify the
Tower/CONFORM prior to and upon completion of NVD operations. Tower will issue ATC
instructions IAW FAAO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control. Weather minimum requirements will be
basic VFR (1,000’ ceiling/3 miles visibility).
 102                                                EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013


   8.14.1. Airfield lighting priority will be given to non-participating aircraft. When requested,
   Tower will adjust lighting settings and advise crew prior to making changes. Tower will
   inform crews when non-participating aircraft are 15 flying miles from the airport. Tower
   will notify JOSHUA/SPORT when NVD operations are in effect and termination.
   8.14.2. Aircraft conducting NVD operations shall terminate or exit the Class D upon
   notification of inbound non-participating aircraft. Taxi operations will be conducted with
   lights “on”. During scheduling with the ROC, crews shall enter “NVD Operations” in the
   Sortie Title.
   8.14.3. Both Tower and crew may call for immediate termination of the NVD operations
   based on operational priorities.
   8.14.4. The following areas are authorized for NVD operations with prior approval through
   412 OG: Lakebed Rwy 07/25, 09/27, 30L and 36C, and South Base Rwy 6/24. Helicopters
   do not need prior permission to operate on South Base Rwy 6/24.
8.15. Airborne Pickup. Pilots will advise Ground Control of airborne pickup intentions on
initial contact. With crew concurrence, Tower may clear an aircraft for takeoff between
elements of an airborne pickup. Aircraft must be assigned to Edwards.
8.16. Weather Balloon Launch Procedures. The 412 OSS Weather Flight (412 OSS/OSW)
will contact the Tower for approval to launch a weather observation balloon within 7 SM of the
airfield. Normally, weather observation balloons will be launched from building 3520
approximately 1.5 to 2 miles north of the airfield. Tower will coordinate approval with the
controlling/using agency for R-2515 prior to the launch and pass the approval or disapproval in
the interest of flight safety (and reason for delay if disapproved) back to the Weather Flight IAW
EAFB Plan 15-1, Weather Support Plan. Upon approval of a balloon launch, the Weather Flight
will notify Tower when the balloon is released and again when the balloon passes 12,000’ AGL.
Tower will pass both notifications to the using agency for R-2515.
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                             103

            PRECISION IMPACT RANGE AREA AND ALPHA CORRIDOR

9.1. Overview. This chapter describes PIRA and Alpha Corridor procedures and range
operations within these areas. It applies to range personnel and AFTC organizations, other
government agencies, contractors and other organizations that use the facilities and equipment.
The PIRA and Alpha Corridor are scheduled IAW AFFTCI 11-15.
9.2. Definitions. The following terms are common to operations within the PIRA.
   9.2.1. Radio Frequency. PIRA master control station (DOWNFALL) and SPORT monitor
   mission frequencies when aircraft operate on the range.
   9.2.2. Range Classifications (Table 9.1.). A range’s classification (A, B or C) may change
   due to the type of activity being conducted on that range at that time.

Table 9.1. Range Classifications
Class A        Range is manned, has ground scoring capability and an RCO on the ground
               controlling the aircraft
Class B        Range is manned or unmanned with ground scoring capability but no RCO on
               the ground to control the aircraft
Class C        Range is unmanned with no scoring or ground aircraft control capability
   9.2.3. RCO. For Class A range operations a qualified RCO controls air-to-ground
   operations. The RCO is the final authority for safe airborne range operations and is required
   during all Class A range operations and/or mission profiles with flight below 300’ AGL.
   9.2.4. Range Operations. The DOWNFALL supervisor is designated as the Downfall Range
   Control Officer (DRCO) and has delegated authority from the Range Operations Officer
   (ROO) to comply with all instructions requirements outlined in AFI 13-212. Under Class B
   Range Operations, the RCO function is delegated to SPORT .
   9.2.5. SPORT. Controls airborne access to the PIRA and Alpha Corridor. SPORT uses
   instrumentation and surveillance radars, which provide precise positioning, airspace
   surveillance, traffic advisories and boundary calls.
   9.2.6. DOWNFALL. Controls ground activity within the PIRA and is located in the
   northeast corner of the West Range. Surface vehicles must obtain approval from
   DOWNFALL prior to entering the PIRA Monday-Friday 0700L to 1700L or whenever
   DOWNFALL is manned.
   9.2.7. Live Ordnance. Any munitions which contain energetic material in high enough
   concentration such that the material presents an explosive hazard and is capable of producing
   blast pressure, fragmentation, and incendiary or thermal effects. The term munitions
   includes confined gaseous, liquid, and solid propellants, explosives, pyrotechnics, chemical
   and riot control agents, smokes and incendiaries, bulk explosives, chemical agents, chemical
   weapons, rockets, guided and ballistic missiles, bombs, warheads, mortar rounds, artillery
   ammunition, grenades, mines, torpedoes, depth charges, cluster munitions and dispensers,
   demolition charges and devices and components thereof.

   9.2.8. Foul Line Road (Fig 9.3.). A hard surface roadway extending north and south from
   North Flank to South Flank towers immediately west of the Dual air-to-ground Range
   (DAGRAG) on the West Range. Strafe targets are located 2,000’ from Foul Line Road. On
   the East Range, the road runs east to west immediately south of the strafe target. Strafing
   passes on DAGRAG is authorized on a west to east heading or a south to north heading on
   the East Guns. Strafing will terminate at or prior to crossing Foul Line Road.
   9.2.9. Hot Run/Pass. Intent to release/fire an object/projectile or laser from the aircraft.
   SPORT issues Hot Run clearances (e.g., "Cleared to arm and release/cleared to Lase Hot
   Pass"). When unable to issue clearance, SPORT will instruct the aircraft to "Continue" the
   approach. SPORT will issue the clearance as soon as possible or instruct the aircraft to abort
   the hot pass (providing a reason) when the clearance cannot be issued.
   9.2.10. Cold/Dry Run. A maneuver where the crew simulates weapon releasing/firing an
   object/projectile or laser. SPORT issues a Cold/Dry Run clearance (e.g., "Simulate cleared
   to arm and release/cleared to Lase Dry pass").
   9.2.11. Hung Ordnance. Ordnance not released although a release was attempted.
   9.2.12. South Lakebed. The area of Rogers Lakebed south of the extended centerline of
   South Base Rwy 06/24.
   9.2.13. COWBELL. Call sign for the East Range RCO.
   9.2.14. DAGRAG. Call sign for the West Range RCO.
9.3. General PIRA Procedures. DOWNFALL is the focal point for all ground activities.
SPORT, DOWNFALL and COWBELL or DAGRAG will monitor the assigned mission
frequency as required for mission support during PIRA operations. DOWNFALL maintains a log
of personnel entering/exiting the PIRA and ensures those cleared onto the range are equipped
with a two-way radio for communications with DOWNFALL. DOWNFALL will provide escorts
as necessary.
   9.3.1. The DOWNFALL (to Include DAGRAG/COWBELL) Range Control Officer:
       9.3.1.1. Notifies SPORT when range conditions change during PIRA operations
       (vehicle/personnel movement).
       9.3.1.2. Directs Hot Run abort (transmits "Abort, Abort, Abort" on mission frequency)
       when circumstances warrant.
       9.3.1.3. Advises SPORT/Aircrew when a mission has violated range safety rules and
       determines the need to suspend range operations.
       9.3.1.4. Notifies Det 5, AFRL Site Operations Control Center (SOCC) of pending
       supersonic flights through the Alpha Corridor and PIRA, Haystack Butte and operations
       on the East Range and PB-6.
       9.3.1.5. Maintains a listening watch on mission frequencies and range land mobile
       radios.
   9.3.2. The DOWNFALL Range Control Officer maintains a range log, which includes
   (Table 9.2.):
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                            105


Table 9.2. Range Log
 Details of range sorties
 Types and quantities of ordnance expended
 Dud rates
 Air and ground safety incidents
 Maintenance services requested from Civil Engineering and response dates
   9.3.3. SPORT:
      9.3.3.1. Verifies cleared to arm/release point.
      9.3.3.2. Verifies expected weapon/device impact area/target, etc.
      9.3.3.3. Verifies range status and briefs expected weapon/device impact area/target to
      DOWNFALL before the aircraft enters the range. NOTE: Prior to dropping/firing any
      object/ordnance with undetermined or unique ballistic characteristics, the AFTC Range
      Safety Office will obtain appropriate data from the Project Engineer, calculate impact
      footprints and provide the footprint data to the SPORT Supervisor.
      9.3.3.4. Except as authorized in 9.3.4, SPORT will not authorize an aircraft to arm if an
      inadvertent release of the device would impact outside the PIRA. SPORT’s clearance to
      arm will ensure a 1 statue mile (SM) buffer zone within the confines of the PIRA.
      9.3.3.5. If a weapon/device is inadvertently fired, released or impacts off range, the
      SPORT controller immediately notifies the Ridley Mission Control Center (RMCC)
      Operation Duty Officer (ODO). The ODO and SPORT will complete notifications as
      required.
   9.3.4. The use of live munitions on the PIRA is restricted to PB-13.
      9.3.4.1. Live munitions are limited to those devices having a Net Explosive Weight of
      500 pounds or less.
      9.3.4.2. The release of weapons with live sub-munitions or those containing depleted
      uranium are not authorized. Releases are further restricted to one weapon per pass.
      9.3.4.3. As a general rule, only precision guided munitions employing precision targeting
      methods (e.g., Laser, GPS, Infrared) will be used. Non-precision targeting methods may
      be approved on a case by case basis by Range Safety.
      9.3.4.4. In the event a weapon fails to detonate, the mission will be terminated and the
      target closed until Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), IAW AFI 13-212, Range
      Planning and Operations, and AFI 32-3001, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Program,
      performs a surface sweep of the target area. If the weapon is located on the surface, EOD
      will dispose of the weapon IAW 60-series publications. Craters will be checked for
      uncovered weapons and inspected for condition. In the event the weapon is determined
      by EOD to be below the surface (subsurface), DOWNFALL will record the event in the
      Expended Munitions Tracking Report. Live ordnance deliveries may resume once EOD
      clearance is completed.
      9.3.4.5. PB-13 will not be used for the release of inert stores.
 106                                                  EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013


       9.3.4.6. For environmental compliance, no more than 100 live weapons may be dropped
       in any calendar year. DOWNFALL is responsible for monitoring utilization and advising
       the 412th Range Squadron’s ROO of any mission restrictions resulting from this
       requirement. DOWNFALL shall coordinate all live ordnance operations in advance with
       EOD.
       9.3.4.7. All projects planning to use live munitions are required to contact the AFTC
       Range Safety Office a minimum of 15 days in advance to discuss their requirements. All
       projects shall notify Range Safety/DRCO a minimum of 72 hours in advance of any
       scheduled mission and provide data on weapon type, flight profile and planned release
       conditions.
       9.3.4.8. After analysis of project requirements, Range Safety will provide
       SPORT/DRCO a mission briefing to include approved release profiles and footprint data.
       Deviation from Range Safety approved flight profiles is not authorized.
       9.3.4.9. For live weapon delivery, a qualified RCO will visually monitor the target area
       from a location outside the hazard footprint to provide visual confirmation of weapon
       detonation. The RCO will maintain direct communications with the mission aircraft,
       SPORT and DOWNFALL and discontinue operations in the event of a dud round.
   9.3.5. Ordnance with a maximum energy footprint that exceeds the boundaries of the PIRA
   may be dropped provided the device is equipped with a Range Safety approved flight
   termination system capable of containing the weapon within the PIRA. Test project
   coordinators shall contact the Range Safety Office to determine the flight termination system
   requirements.
   9.3.6. The Project Engineer shall provide the AFTC Range Safety Office with sufficient data
   to calculate impact footprints when planning to drop, fire or launch ordnance/objects with
   undetermined/unique ballistic characteristics.
9.4. Road Closures. See Edwards, AFB Scheduling Procedures for Aircraft and Air/Ground
Support.
   9.4.1. Close Mercury Blvd (Fig 9.1.) when a mission profile indicates a hazard to
   people/equipment using Mercury Blvd. Test directors, test conductors or project range
   control officers will schedule the closure of Mercury Blvd. SPORT may choose to close the
   boulevard prior to mission start although the test project leaders did not request the closure.
   Mercury Blvd should be closed when:
       9.4.1.1. As part of a test scenario, a clearance to arm is required west of Mercury Blvd
       and an inadvertent release of the device would result in impact west of the PIRA, on the
       lakebed or Mercury Blvd.
       9.4.1.2. Doubt exists as to the flight characteristics of the device being dropped (e.g., fuel
       cells, retarded devices with sequential chute deployments) and impact west of the PIRA
       is possible.
       9.4.1.3. A laser hazard would exist on Mercury Blvd caused by the use of a non-eye safe
       laser in other than a point track mode.
       9.4.1.4. Forward firing projectiles, gunfire or rockets cross Mercury Blvd.
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                  107


       9.4.1.5. For any munitions/external stores separations conducted east to west on the West
       Range.
   9.4.2. The Tower will close the Santa Fe Trail (Fig 9.1.) to eastbound vehicular traffic and
   restrict vehicles/personnel from the South Lakebed when Mercury Blvd is closed for PIRA
   operations. Westbound traffic is allowed since the vehicle is proceeding away from the
   hazard area.
9.5. Range Control Officer. A qualified RCO is required in DAGRAG tower and/or
COWBELL tower when weapons delivery altitudes require Class A range operations. Class B
range operations are conducted under SPORT control using normal PIRA procedures when
Class A is not required. Exceptions for maneuvering deliveries or laser-designated deliveries,
which create a hazard for personnel in the range tower, must be approved in the applicable test
plans.
   9.5.1. Each unit or CTF will ensure RCO training includes the following:
       9.5.1.1. The RCO performs a DAGRAG or COWBELL RCO tour of duty supervised by
       the DRCO as part of the RCO training program.
       9.5.1.2. The RCO is thoroughly familiar with the following directives (Table 9.3.):

Table 9.3. Range Directives

9.8. PIRA (Fig 9. 1.). Located on the eastern portion of the EAFB reservation, the PIRA is
used for air-to-ground gunnery, precision bombing tests, photo resolution, spin testing, aerial
decelerator tests, air-to-ground laser tests and other tests requiring precision instrumentation.
Contact Range Safety for approved lasers and laser operations on the PIRA. Any laser operation
outside the scope of a Consultative Letter from AFRL Det 5 (711 HPW/RHDO), PIRA Laser
Safety Survey, has to be reviewed and approved by Test Safety and Range Safety. The PIRA is
subdivided into 2 ranges, West Range and East Range. Each range is scheduled individually or
in conjunction with each other depending on mission requirements. Conduct concurrent
operations within these ranges under SPORT control.

   9.8.1. The West Range is a conventional Class A or Class B dual air-to-ground gun/bomb
   and limited rocket range with associated airspace. The range contains 5 Precision Bombing
   (PB) circles, PB-8 recovery target, a saturation bombing target (Barbell Target) and the
   DAGRAG. PB-1 and PB-10 have scoring instrumentation. PB-13 is approved for limited
   release of live ordnance. West Range boundary coordinates are listed in Attachment 4 item
   206 and PBs are items 91, 124, 148, 162, 172-173, 177, 182 and 183.
      9.8.1.1. A additional target has been added to West range called B target (old PB-4), this
      target has a permanent reflector and also a hot barrel stand for IR testing. Both NGA
      surveyed.
   9.8.2. The East Range is a conventional Class A or Class B, single air-to-ground gunnery,
   bombing and limited rocket range with associated airspace. The East Range has 2 PB bomb
   circles (PB-6 and PB-12), a single air-to-ground gunnery/rocket range and a sensor only
   Mobile Target System (MTS) Simulated Combat Airfield and Tactical Target (SCATT)
   Range (Fig 9.2.). Fig 9.2. depicts a “typical” configuration, which may be modified to
   support mission requirements. PB-6 is part of the East Range but is not approved for
   bombing, it is primarily used for laser/sensor testing. PB-12 has video bomb scoring and is
   the only target available for bombs and has the Video Bombing Scoring (VBS) capability.
   The gunnery range has a left-hand pattern for strafing/bombing with 10 strafe targets and a
   bomb circle, lanes one and two have the acoustic scoring capability. The East Range

   9.9.1. Crew procedures:
       9.9.1.1. Contact SPORT prior to departure to confirm range schedule and provide
       ordnance release parameters.
       9.9.1.2. Coordinate entry point for the Alpha Corridor or PIRA with SPORT.
       9.9.1.3. Without prior coordination with SPORT, avoid flying between 2500' MSL to
       3500' MSL crossing Rosamond Blvd north of Rosamond Dry Lake.
       9.9.1.4. Request PIRA/Alpha Corridor clearance from SPORT on mission frequency or
       343.7 (Channel 5) prior to entry.
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                            111


      9.9.1.5. Entry to the East Range is generally from north of Hwy 58 in the vicinity of
      Kramer Junction.
      9.9.1.6. Enter PB-6 from the north or west, remain north of Det. 5, AFRL, if possible.
      NOTE: Remain at or above 5300’ MSL when overflying Det 5, AFRL unless otherwise
      coordinated with the Det 5, AFRL Site Operations Control Center (SOCC).
      9.9.1.7. Confirm the following (Table 9.4.) with SPORT before first run:

Table 9.4. Weapons Release/Fire Information
Type and quantity of weapons to release/fire and whether ordnance is live/inert/training
Intended speed at release/fire point
Intended altitude at release/fire point
Aircraft maneuver (level, dive, turn, etc.)

      9.9.1.8. Acknowledge position advisories and range constraints.
      9.9.1.9. Supersonic approaches into the PIRA are restricted to the Alpha Corridor and
      Pira Supersonic Area as defined in paragraph 12.3.
      9.9.1.10. Mission plan changes must be forwarded to SPORT as soon as they are known
      to ensure successful coordination.
   9.9.2. The Test Director (TD) or Test Conductor (TC) determines if minimum altitudes
   require a Class A or Class B range for planned operations.
   9.9.3. Missions requiring the Alpha Corridor, the PIRA in conjunction with the Alpha
   Corridor or use of any PIRA ranges, under SPORT control, will:
      9.9.3.1. Provide Range Division ODO pre-mission planning and briefing information.
      9.9.3.2. Use COLD SPOTTING charges for ALL air-to-ground weapons deliveries to
      reduce the risk of fire from spotting charges during the summer months (April-
      September). Hot spots for test plans or build-up sorties for test plans may be used if
      required. If hot spots are used for test or test prep purposes, deliveries should be
      restricted to the more accurate delivery methods listed in Table 9.5. Exceptions to this
      policy may be granted on a case by case basis by contacting the PIRA supervisor (5-
      6148) or the Range Operations Office (7-2727).
      9.9.3.3. When planning to drop/fire/shoot an object onto the PIRA, regardless of the
      intent to use instrumentation radar or other range assets, the TD/TC or RCO assisting the
      test mission will provide SPORT with the information identified in Table 9.6., as
      applicable, no later than 1 hour prior to departure:

   9.9.4. Simultaneous mission operations:
       9.9.4.1. Lead crew commences final coordination to de-conflict their respective
       operation after preliminary agreement to conduct simultaneous operations between
       missions/test squadrons. Crews should exchange significant details of each operation to
       prevent conflicts. DO NOT place the burden of de-conflicting missions on a single user.
       Do not require visual separation from a DZ at extreme altitude or when restrictions to
       flight visibility exist.
       9.9.4.2. If crews from conflicting missions agree to conduct simultaneous operations,
       each crew must telephone the SPORT supervisor, brief their respective mission, confirm
       each has coordinated with the other and agreed to simultaneous operations. The Survival
       School, Farm and ENAD DZs are within the Alpha Corridor. PIRA missions and
       paradrop operations in the Alpha Corridor may operate concurrently under SPORT
       control. Crews will advise SPORT of specific flight paths, altitudes and expected
       proximity to a DZ when simultaneous operations involve paradrop missions.
       9.9.4.3. Aircrews of conflicting missions will contact SPORT prior to departure and brief
       mission changes, verify coordination with the other crew and agreement to conduct
       simultaneous operations.
       9.9.4.4. SPORT is the final authority for simultaneous or continued simultaneous
       operations.
   9.9.5. Arming procedures:
       9.9.5.1. Crews will not select Master Arm Enable without specific clearance from
       SPORT/RCO except when using Flight Lead Control Operations (paragraph 9.11). The
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                             113


       phrase “Cleared to Arm” in this and subsequent paragraphs is used to denote whatever
       process or procedure is used to unlock weapons prior to weapons release.
       9.9.5.2. SPORT/RCO will not authorize a test mission to arm weapon(s) without
       assurance:
          9.9.5.2.1. The aircraft has crossed into range airspace, or
          9.9.5.2.2. The gun fire, rocket, gravity bomb or other devices would impact within
          the PIRA if an inadvertent release would occur at the moment of arming, or
          9.9.5.2.3. If Mercury Blvd is closed and an inadvertent release occurs, the device
          being deployed would impact on Rogers Lakebed within the confines of the Alpha
          Corridor or PIRA. See AFFTCI 11-15 for authorized times when Mercury Blvd may
          be closed.
       9.9.5.3. The following is required if SPORT is using radar to obtain position information
       on the test aircraft. SPORT will not issue clearance to arm when:
          9.9.5.3.1. Position/identity of test aircraft is uncertain or questionable.
          9.9.5.3.2. The controller is dissatisfied with the radar presentation.
       9.9.5.4. Crews will ensure armament switches are safe until “Cleared to arm.” Do not
       arm (Table 9.7.) until:

Table 9.7. Cleared to Arm Points
 Crossing Mercury Blvd on west to east runs into West Range
 Crossing Lancaster Blvd when Mercury Blvd is closed.
 NOTE: SRB may impose more stringent requirements
 Crossing Hwy 395 on east to west runs into West Range
 Established on the range south of Haystack Butte on south to north runs on East Range
 Crossing Hwy 58 on north to south runs into the East Range
       9.9.5.5. Abort a hot run any time circumstances warrant. Acknowledge and confirm all
       arming switches are safe when directed to abort run ("Abort, Abort, Abort").
       9.9.5.6. Notify SPORT of suspected malfunctions/anomalies.
       9.9.5.7. Automatic delivery/separation by onboard radar or other methods is authorized.
       9.9.5.8. SPORT will issue Simulate/Cleared to Arm calls.
          9.9.5.8.1. First run will be dry unless pre-coordinated with SPORT/DOWNFALL,
          otherwise a first hot pass requires Class A procedures. (Reference AFI 11-214 para
          5.3.2.1. The crew/mission director will determine hot/dry status before beginning
          each new run.
          9.9.5.8.2. All missions involving the release of live ordnance are required to conduct
          a dry pass without exception.
   9.9.6. SPORT will:

       9.9.6.1. Brief DOWNFALL on range operations and pending supersonic flights in the
       Alpha Corridor (include number of runs and duration). Verify range status and brief
       expected weapon/device impact areas/targets, etc. prior to aircraft range entry.
       9.9.6.2. Provide a qualified controller to direct/monitor PIRA missions.
       9.9.6.3. Confirm the following (Table 9.8.) with crew before first run:

Table 9.8. Aircraft/Weapons Data
 Type and quantity of weapon(s) to be released/fired
 Aircraft maneuver (level, dive turn, etc.)
 Planned target
 Weapon status (live or inert)
       9.9.6.4. Transmit, "Abort, Abort, Abort" to terminate a hot run when circumstances
       warrant.
       9.9.6.5. Confirm weapon(s) switches are "Off/Safe" after actual/attempted release/fire.
       9.9.6.6. When an air-to-ground tone correlation is used in conjunction with the release of
       a device, it should not be transmitted on the frequency (343.7) being used for advisory
       instructions. If possible, a second frequency will be scheduled to record the tone. A
       nominal period of five seconds is established for tone correlation.
       9.9.6.7. Verify with DOWNFALL that the PIRA is clear prior to conducting a
       weapon/device drop/separation or laser operations.
       9.9.6.8. Notify Tower and DOWNFALL of mission termination.
       9.9.6.9. Provide traffic advisories and boundary calls as required.
       9.9.6.10. Terminate range activity when safety is in question.
       9.9.6.11. No restrictions are implied for maneuvers associated with either simulated
       evasive maneuver by the crew or when unusual maneuvers are required to satisfy test
       objectives.
9.10. Combat or NON-Eye Safe Laser Operations.
   9.10.1. Roles and Responsibilities. For the purposes of this instruction, the terms “area
   track” and “point track” are interchangeable and indicate a targeting pod mode that will
   continue to track a specific geographic area without crew inputs. TC/TDs will perform pre-
   mission planning and coordination with SPORT IAW paragraph 9.9.2. and 9.9.3. Pilot pre-
   flight briefing with SPORT will include combat LASER attack plans IAW paragraph 9.9.1.
   Once airborne, SPORT will confirm planned attacks IAW paragraph 9.9.6.
   9.10.2. Airborne Combat Laser Operations. Pilots will ensure LASER switches are OFF /
   SAFE until cleared by SPORT. Prior to the combat laser pass, the pilot will inform SPORT
   of the target, planned altitude, run-in direction, and ordnance to be dropped, if applicable,
   (e.g., “Zoom 01, next attack dry with combat LASER against PB-1, west-to-east run-in,
   FL200”). Combat LASER Communications is located in Table 9.9. below.
     EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                115


     Table 9.9. Example Communication for Combat LASER
      A/C: Inform SPORT of next attack target / altitude / run-in direction & ordnance to be dropped if
      applicable.
    “Zoom 01, next attack dry with combat LASER against PB-1, west-to-east run-in, FL200”
      A/C: Complete area / point track on target
    “Zoom 01, point / area track on PB-1, request permission to lase”
      SPORT: Checks for traffic between F-16 and Target, receives clearance from DOWNFALL for
      LASER Operation
    “Zoom 01, Cleared to lase PB-1” OR
    “Zoom 01, Continue” used to respond to radio calls while SPORT is awaiting clearance for Zoom
      01 to lase.
    “Zoom 01, Cleared to lase PB-1”
      A/C: LASER – ARM
      [Time permitting] “Zoom 01, Lasing”
      Complete Lasing Run
      “Zoom 01, LASER ARM-OFF”
      [For attacks with actual weapons delivery] : “Zoom 01, Off Hot, Switches Safe, LASER ARM -
      OFF ”
      SPORT: “Zoom 01, Roger”

        9.10.3. Prior to and during Laser Operations. The aircraft will achieve area or point track on
        the target and will inform SPORT once this is accomplished. SPORT will then check for
        traffic between the lasing aircraft and the target, receive clearance from DOWNFALL for
        LASER operation and clear the aircraft to lase (e.g., “Zoom 01, Cleared to lase PB-X”). If
        there is a conflict, SPORT will call “Zoom 01, Continue” until the conflict is resolved. The
        aircraft will acknowledge clearance to lase, and, time permitting, will inform SPORT the
        LASER is armed and call when lasing begins and ends. Following the lasing pass, the
        aircraft will inform SPORT they are complete and the LASER is OFF / SAFE (e.g., “Zoom
        01, LASER ARM-OFF”). If actual weapons delivery occurred in conjunction with laser
        operations, the call will be “Zoom 01, Off Hot, Switches Safe, LASER ARM - OFF”. SPORT
        will acknowledge this call.
        9.10.4. SPORT will confirm Mercury Blvd is closed IAW paragraph 9.4.
        9.10.5. Dragging LASER Passes. For passes where the LASER will be dragged across the
        ground or other than area / point track on the targeting pod, pilots will use plain terminology
        to communicate requirements to SPORT.
        9.10.6. Lasing Contingencies. Lasing aircraft will maintain vigilant lookout in the targeting
        pod for an unstable pod track and for air and/or ground traffic. If traffic is encountered or if
        the pod stops tracking the target, the lasing aircraft will immediately stop lasing, break track
        and switch LASER to OFF / SAFE. A “knock-it-off” call will be made over the radio.
     9.11. PIRA Flight Lead Control Operations. Flight Lead Control Operations allow the Flight
     Lead/Aircraft Commander (FL/AC) to assume range safety responsibilities and eliminates the
     requirement for SPORT to clear the crew to “arm and release” on every pass.
 116                                                 EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013


   9.11.1. Flight lead control operations are authorized for fighter and trainer aircraft on test or
   training missions using training munitions with a known footprint. FL/AC is not authorized
   for missions using live ordnance.
   9.11.2. Under flight lead control, SPORT and DOWNFALL monitor mission frequency and
   will call for an abort if required for safety. SPORT controls airborne access to the PIRA.
   9.11.3. Flight lead control procedures:
       9.11.3.1. The FL/AC will contact DOWNFALL and SPORT to pre-brief the mission
       prior to stepping. Briefings will cover type and amount of training munitions, planned
       events, pattern ground tracks and run-in headings.
       9.11.3.2. DOWNFALL will provide the crew run-in/pattern restrictions and location of
       manned sites on the range.
       9.11.3.3. The FL/AC must fully understand restrictions imposed and the location of
       manned sites. The FL/AC will advise SPORT and DOWNFALL of plans to operate
       within the PIRA under “flight lead control”. It is critical the FL/AC clearly communicate
       expectations, mission requirements and planned profile to DOWNFALL and SPORT.
       9.11.3.4. After takeoff the FL/AC will check-in with SPORT and DAGRAG or
       COWBELL on mission frequency for restrictions/planned events update. SPORT will
       clear the FL/AC for flight lead control operations.
       9.11.3.5. The FL/AC assumes range safety responsibilities once cleared for flight lead
       control operations.
   9.11.4. Due to the small size of the PIRA, the weapon's footprint for an unintentional release
   may not remain within the range boundary. Therefore, the FL/AC will safe delivery systems
   and call "OFF (hot/dry), SWITCHES SAFE" after each pass. FL/AC may arm delivery
   systems when established on base leg within the range boundary (i.e. conventional pattern).
   When the release pattern either exits or starts outside the range boundary, FL/ACs may arm
   delivery systems when entering the range and the weapons footprint for an inadvertent
   release is within the range boundary (i.e. on final for a radar release pattern after crossing the
   range boundary) and does not endanger manned sites.
9.12. DAGRAG (Fig 9. 3.). A conventional low altitude, Class A or Class B, air-to-ground
gunnery, bombing and limited rocket range with associated airspace.
   9.12.1. DAGRAG has a North Range (right traffic) and a South Range (left traffic). Each
   range has 1 bomb/rocket circle, 5 strafe targets, 3 flank instrumentation towers and 1
   common range control tower. (South Range has the acoustic scoring capability on lanes six
   and seven) Conventional 3 by 4 NM flight patterns (Fig 9.4.) support the ranges. Patterns are
   limited to Mercury Blvd to the north, Ave A to the south and a west base leg 1 NM east of
   the north/south lakebed runway. Normally, the eastern crosswind legs of the patterns are 1
   NM beyond the target for a single aircraft. When 2 or more aircraft are in the same pattern,
   each adjusts the eastern crosswind leg to maintain adequate separation. There is no
   minimum altitude restriction on the north range pattern. Restrict south range pattern base leg
   to 4,800' MSL minimum until passing the south base runway centerline extension (Fig 9.5.).
   The airspace extends vertically to 14,000' MSL.

  9.12.2. Minimum recovery altitudes are flown IAW AFI 11-2FT V3, Flight Test Operations
  Procedures. Lower minimum recovery altitudes must be included in the test plan approved
  by the Test Safety Review process.
  9.12.3. Crews will brief the RCO on the mission including ordnance and type(s) of delivery,
  minimum altitudes, type patterns and foul criteria for Class A range operations and review
  pattern communication procedures. See AFI 11-2FT V3 for Weapons Employment
  Minimum Altitudes. RCO requirements concerning range classifications are defined in
  paragraph 9.2.
  9.12.4. Contact SPORT on mission/common frequency for range clearance.                  Hold as
  directed by SPORT while awaiting clearance.
  9.12.5. After receiving range clearance, contact DAGRAG Control on assigned frequency.
  DAGRAG Control/RCO assumes control of the mission in the DAGRAG pattern. Provide
  the following (Table 9.10.):

Table 9.10. DAGRAG Information
 Aircraft type and tail number
 Estimated number of sorties/passes
 Type/quantity of ordnance
  9.12.6. Procedures.
      9.12.6.1. Fly at least one dry pass on each target complex (i.e. PB-10, strafe, PB-1, etc.).
      9.12.6.2. Obtain DAGRAG Control clearance for each sortie/pass. During Class A range
      operations, armament and firing clearances are issued by the RCO.
      9.12.6.3. Comply with mandatory radio calls in the DAGRAG pattern as follows:
         9.12.6.3.1. Before rolling in on final, transmit "(call sign), in hot/cold." Do not
         switch on armament master switches until after rollout on final and cleared by
         DAGRAG Control/RCO. “SAFE” switches as soon as practicable after pullout.

         hot/dry, Switches Safe."
  9.12.7. Follow SPORT position advisories, if applicable.
  9.12.8. Crews will maintain separation from other aircraft while flying DAGRAG missions.
      9.12.8.1. When more than 1 aircraft are in the same DAGRAG pattern, each crew adjusts
      position in the pattern to maintain proper spacing. Extend the pattern as far east as the
      western boundary of the East Range, or as far as required within the PIRA to maintain
      separation when the East Range is not in use.
      9.12.8.2. To minimize range use time and to provide time between each sortie for
      weapon scoring, DAGRAG may request the crew to extend the pattern 3 miles east of
      Foul Line Road before turning crosswind. This minimizes the potential ricochet hazard
      and ensures when one aircraft is turning final, the second aircraft is turning downwind.
      Further, both aircraft will intercept Foul Line Road simultaneously.
  9.12.9. Notify DAGRAG and SPORT of suspected ordnance malfunction/anomaly.
  9.12.10. Inform DAGRAG and SPORT of mission completion.

9.15. Airdrop Malfunction. An airdrop malfunction is defined as the complete or partial
failure of: the aircraft airdrop systems, any piece of airdrop equipment, personnel or cargo
rigging to function as designed regardless of the after-impact condition, serious injury or death to
a crewmember or other personnel, damage to aircraft equipment or structure, or damage to the
airdrop load or related equipment. EXCEPTION: Any drogue malfunction (i.e. “cigar
rolling” or blown panels) and the crew are able to successfully jettison the drogue without
using any emergency drogue jettison procedures (i.e. emergency drogue jettison switch or
cutting the drogue line), the mission may continue, including further airdrops, with
concurrence of the mission commander/Pilot-in Charge.
   9.15.1. If in the R-2508 complex notify the SOF and/or the 418 FLTS Operations
   Supervisor. Outside the R-2508 complex notify the nearest USAF command post.
   9.15.2. Notify the DZ control when a malfunction occurs so the load can be isolated and/or
   inspected.
   9.15.3. Unless a greater hazard exists, crews will not de-rig the aircraft or reposition or
   adjust the airdrop systems or equipment. Record all mission computers, FMS, etc.

   information relating to the airdrop. If possible, download the mission history to disk or other
   media device.
   9.15.4. For test missions continue or discontinue testing in accordance with the test and/or
   safety package. For non-test missions aircrews must receive approval from the FOA to
   continue with non-airdrop related training.
   9.15.5. Use of DD Form 1748-2, Joint Malfunction Report, to document airdrop
   malfunctions and incidents. Aircrews will describe the malfunction and/or incident in as
   much detail as possible. Attach all mission planning materials, load plan, DD Form 1748-1,
   weather sheets, etc. to the DD Form 1748-2. Turn in to the 418 FLTS Operations Supervisor
   within 12 hours who will follow guidance in AFI 13-217 for processing the DD Form 1748-
   2.
   9.15.6. All airdrop system malfunctions and damage to aircraft equipment require an entry in
   the AFTO Form 781.
9.16. PIRA DZs: Off DZ but On PIRA Procedures. For suspected or confirmed off-DZ
airdrops involving death or injury to personnel, comply with airdrop malfunction procedures,
terminate the mission, and land as soon as possible. For all other suspected or confirmed off-DZ
but on-PIRA airdrops not involving death or injury to personnel, airdrops may continue once
approved by the FOA.
9.17. PIRA and NON-PIRA DZs: Off DZ and OFF PIRA Procedures. For suspected or
confirmed off-PIRA airdrops, comply with airdrop malfunction procedures, terminate the
mission, and land as soon as possible.
9.18. Non-Aircraft Calculated Computed Air Release Points. For suspected or confirmed
off-PIRA airdrops, comply with airdrop malfunction procedures, terminate the mission, and land
as soon as possible; however, for non-aircraft calculated CARPs (e.g. jumpmaster directed, range
control provided release point), the unit or organization responsible for calculating the CARP
assumes responsibility for an off-DZ drop.

      10.3.7.4. Rough One: Numerous windmills in vicinity of route. Aircrew should carefully
      examine all obstacles prior to use. Within the first 7.5 miles of the route there are
      approximately 7 windmills within 2 miles of route centerline. The closest windmill is
      approximately 7 miles north of the start point and is within 1 mile of the centerline on the
      west side. The windmills are approximately 500' AGL, intruding significantly into the
      200' floor of the route
10.4. Special Operating Procedures. See AFI 11-2FTV3, Flight Test Operations Procedures,
for additional guidance and restrictions.
   10.4.1. All route altitudes are 200’ AGL to 1500' AGL except to avoid airports and noise
   sensitive areas and when flying supersonic in approved corridors where the minimum altitude
   is 500’ AGL. Test missions requiring altitudes lower than 200' AGL are treated on a case-
   by-case basis.
   10.4.2. For the Sidewinder/Jedi low levels, direction of flight is clockwise only.
   10.4.3. Routes are subsonic except as noted in Paragraph 10.3.4.
   10.4.4. Sidewinder/Jedi low level route width is 2 NM either side of centerline.
   10.4.5. Avoid flying along highways and/or valleys to avoid high-density civil air traffic.
   10.4.6. Avoid charted, uncontrolled airports by 3 NM miles or 1500' AGL. When active,
   avoid Mojave’s Class D airspace (4.3NM or 4,800’MSL). Ensure flight paths do not violate
   airport airspace boundaries.
   10.4.7. Avoid certain designated noise sensitive natural recreation areas (Para 5.2.7) where
   MOA floors are above route ceilings (3,000’ AGL and 3,000’ lateral from canyon walls and
   mountains).
   10.4.8. To mitigate the risk of opposite direction traffic, offset right of centerline when
   transiting the saddles between valleys. Rising terrain may mask advisory calls.
   10.4.9. If R-2524 has been scheduled and confirmed for any route that transits this airspace,
   aircrews are required to establish contact with either China Control (UHF 301.0) or Echo
   Control (UHF 381.9) prior to entry. If contact cannot be established aircrews shall exit the
   route and not enter R-2524.
   10.4.10. Aircraft re-entering the R-2508 Complex on a low level shall re-establish radio
   contact with JOSHUA/SPORT to receive a complex clearance and squawk.
   10.4.11. Course reversals are not authorized.
   10.4.12. A gold mining operation (Briggs Mining Company) located in the Panamint Valley
   approximately 7 NM south of Ballarat (N3556.28’ W11711.20’) conducts daily blasting
   between 1200L-1330L and 1600L–1730L with a flying rock hazard to indeterminable
   altitudes. Avoid over-flight during blasting periods.
   10.4.13. The ITA affects the transition to the Sidewinder low level route. Crew shall avoid
   the vertical/lateral limits of the transition area when it is active unless they have a clearance
   to transit from JOSHUA.

10.5. Scheduling.
   10.5.1. Schedule routes IAW AFFTCI 11-15.
   10.5.2. Contact either the ROC or the Airspace Manager for the latest list of approved
   IR/VR routes.
   10.5.3. SPORT will approve/disapprove unscheduled use of R-2515 TFR routes on a case by
   case basis. Aircrews will provide callsign, aircraft type and entry/exit time.
   10.5.4. Neither JOSHUA nor SPORT separate aircraft operating on conflicting routes.
10.6. Low Level Procedures.
   10.6.1. Aircrew will:
       10.6.1.1. Advise SPORT/JOSHUA of your intentions to operate on a Complex low level
       route.
       10.6.1.2. When utilizing the Sidewinder/Jedi/Rough One routes, monitor UHF 315.9
       while below 1500' AGL and on the low level route.
          10.6.1.2.1. UHF 315.9 is the low level frequency used exclusively by all aircraft
          engaged in low level flight activities below 1,500’ AGL within R-2508. This is an
          aircrew-to-aircrew frequency and is not monitored by JOSHUA/SPORT.
          10.6.1.2.2. High Frequency (HF) converter/repeaters located on Sherman Peak
          northwest of Domeland, Silver Peak east of Bishop and Keeler Peak in the Panamint
          Valley enable aircrews to communicate with land management aircraft working in the
          local area. A tone precedes voice communications.
       10.6.1.3. Make predetermined radio calls in the blind at points identified during preflight
       planning using conflict information contained in route descriptions and Special Operating
       Procedures. Include call sign, number of aircraft, area/point entering and direction of
       flight and altitude (AGL). During low level flight, restrict transmissions to:
          10.6.1.3.1. Initial check in (route entry) on frequency and calls to de-conflict traffic.
          10.6.1.3.2. Report exiting the route to SPORT or JOSHUA on the appropriate sector
          frequency and reestablish radar identification. Missions requiring continued support
          after completing a low level route shall contact JOSHUA or SPORT on appropriate
          sector frequency to provide services on an assigned mission frequency.
   10.6.2. Over-flight of populated areas within and surrounding the R-2508 Complex is
   restricted to 3,000’ AGL or above. See Para 11.1, Over-flight of Populated Areas, and
   Attachment 5, Geographical Coordinates for R-2508 Airspace Areas, where over-flights are
   restricted.
10.7. Low Altitude Charts. 412 OSS will maintain master charts in the Airfield Management
Operations flight planning room, to include locally surveyed obstructions. Previously
undocumented obstructions observed by 412 OSS/OSAA will be submitted to 412 OG/OGV and
published in a Flight Crew Information File (FCIF). The FCIF will remain active until the
obstruction is published in the AP-1B.

 ALTITUDE: NLT 200’ AGL to 1500’ AGL (points A to K); NLT 500’ AGL to 1500’ AGL
 (points K to M). Climb above 1500’ AGL as required to avoid noise sensitive areas and airports
 (see note 7).
  ROUTE WIDTH – 2 NM either side of centerline.
 Special Operating Procedures:
 (1)         Entry Procedure: Prior to entry, notify JOSHUA of intentions and planned Entry/Exit
 point. Above 3000’ AGL and prior to route entry, make intentions call on Low Level Common
 (315.9). Give way to any traffic already established on the route prior to entry.
(2)          Alternate Entry: This is procedural control and traffic may enter at any point.
 Preferred alternate entry points are C and E.
(3)          Alternate Exit: This is procedural control and traffic may exit at any point. Preferred
 alternate exit points are H and K.
(4)      All aircraft operating on the Sidewinder/Jedi Transition will utilize the R-2508 low
 altitude common frequency 315.9. When entering low level environment, transmit in the blind
 call sign, number and type of aircraft, and intentions. Monitor 315.9 until exiting low altitude
 regime. Repeat calls entering new areas, or crossing ridge lines.
(5)          Slower aircraft (i.e. C-12, T-34) may be on the route at the same time. Use caution
 for airspeed variations that may exist between aircraft. Aircraft being overtaken has the right of
 way.
(6)          To mitigate the risk of opposite direction traffic, offset right of centerline when
 transiting saddles between valleys. Rising terrain may mask advisory calls.
(7)          Avoid all noise sensitive areas by 3000’AGL or 3000’ laterally. Avoid all airports
 along route by 1500’ AGL or 3 NM.
(8)          Point A to B, fly 2 NM left of centerline or above 3000’ AGL to avoid the Isabella
 Dam, surrounding communities, and Kernville.

(9)         Point B to C, avoid the extremely noise sensitive areas of Olancha and Cartago.
(10)        Point C to D, avoid the extremely noise sensitive areas of Keeler and Lone Pine.
 Caution: intensive hang glider activity in the vicinity of Dolomite and northeast shore of Owens
 lake.
(11)        Caution: high migratory bird activity between F and H during daylight hours.
(12)        CAUTION: Possible merging traffic from aircraft on Jedi Transition (approaching
 from west via Point C). Sidewinder users offset east of Point J for deconfliction. Sidewinder
 users make mandatory radio call approaching Point J “Call sign, Sidewinder, approaching Point
 Juliet”. Make calls on 315.9.
 (13)       Point J to K. 198’ multi unlit towers N35°53.797 W117°17.558. Avoid Trona Airport
 by 1500’ AGL or 3 NM.
 (14)       Point K to M, watch for traffic northbound to China Lake initial at 4000’ MSL.
 (15)       Point L to M, route transits underneath instrument procedure at NID (arc and final
 approach). Use caution if exiting route prior to point M.
 (16)       Conflicts: A to L: IR-236; B to D: VR-1255; E to I: VR-1205-1255-1262; I to L: VR-
 1262, IR-200; K to M: IR-200-211.

JEDI TRANSITION: At Point C, proceed east to Point J.

CAUTION: Possible merging Sidewinder traffic from the north via Point I. Jedi users offset
west of Point J for deconfliction. Jedi users make mandatory radio call approaching Point J
“Call sign, Jedi Transition, approaching Point Juliet”. Make calls on 315.9.

                                        RESTRICTIONS

11.1. Over-flight of Populated Areas (Fig 11. 1.). Over-flights shall be conducted so that
persons on the ground experience a minimum of annoyance. It is not enough for the pilot to be
satisfied that no person is actually endangered. Definite and particular effort shall be taken to fly
in such a manner that the individuals do not believe they or their property are endangered. All
communities within the R-2508 Complex are considered “noise sensitive areas”. Noise sensitive
areas shall be avoided by 3,000’ AGL. The only exception to this restriction is while operating
on an approved test plan. Noise sensitive areas include North Edwards, Victorville, Palmdale,
Apple Valley, Lancaster, Mojave, Tehachapi, Adelanto, Boron, Rosamond, Keeler, Lone Pine,
Trona, Inyokern, Independence, Olancha, Randsburg, Johannesburg, Red Mountain, Ridgecrest,
Stove Pipe Wells, Lake Isabella, Kernville or other residential communities. Helicopters and
Aero Club aircraft are not restricted at any time except under emergency conditions or during
airport transitions.

   11.1.2. Recreational use near these communities and along the Kern River is highest during
   the summer months. Crews should anticipate increased sensitivity to operations near these
   areas.
11.2. Aircraft Expendable Operations (Fig 11. 2.).
   11.2.1. Aircraft expendable operations are allowed for currently fielded flares in R-2515,
   west of Hwy 395, so that the burn-out altitude is greater than 2,000’ AGL except as noted
   within Fig 11.2.

Figure 11.2. R-2515 Flare Burnout Altitude




       11.2.1.1. Crews shall pre-brief SPORT prior to flight on intended flare operations.
       11.2.1.2. Flares are restricted to R-2515 only, unless previously coordinated with R-
       2524, R-2502, and/or R-2505 airspace managers. Flares may be used above 5,000’ AGL
       in R-2515. Use of flares below 5,000’ AGL requires a low fire danger as decided upon by
       RSO or applicable DoD agency. Chaff and/or Flares are prohibited below 5,000’ AGL
       over the PIRA during EOD removal operations.
       11.2.1.3. The dry months (June through September) pose the greatest fire hazard. Crews
       will report all fires within R-2515 to SPORT, Tower or DOWNFALL as soon as
       possible.
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                               135


      11.2.1.4. Crews shall comply with standing altitude restrictions over populated areas, the
      mines, etc.
      11.2.1.5. Release over Edwards Class D airspace shall be greater than 15,000’ AGL.
   11.2.2. Chaff release is only authorized on specifically approved air-to-ground gunnery
   ranges, MOAs and Warning Areas.
      11.2.2.1. Chaff release is authorized in R-2515, Owens, Saline, Panamint and Shoshone.
      Contact AFTC’s Frequency Management Office for restrictions.

       the critical operation times (T-Initial, T-Arming, and T-Go) for the specific test to the
       ROC for dissemination.
       11.4.2.2. All Hazardous/Toxic Test Operations, which affect the availability of AFTC
       airspace, shall be scheduled in accordance with AFFTCI 11-115. When deemed
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                137


       appropriate, a local Airfield Advisory shall be issued by Airfield Management Operations
       to identify a specific hazard and no fly area.
       11.4.2.3. Initial Call (T-Initial): Det 5, AFRL SOCC shall notify SPORT, DOWNFALL,
       Tower and the Range ODO of the test status and that the count is proceeding as
       scheduled or of any anomalies.
       11.4.2.4. Arming Call (T-Arming): Det 5, AFRL SOCC shall notify SPORT,
       DOWNFALL, Tower and the Range ODO to begin airspace restrictions for system
       arming. After verification is received by Det 5, AFRL SOCC that airspace restrictions
       are active, the arming party will then proceed to the test site and begin installation of
       explosives.
       11.4.2.5. Last Hold Point (T-Go): Det 5, AFRL SOCC shall notify SPORT,
       DOWNFALL, Tower and Range ODO confirming airspace status and intent to proceed.
       This should be the last hold point at which the test can be put on a hold safely. If the T-
       Go time has been exceeded, Det 5, AFRL SOCC will contact the Test Conductor and
       determine the status of the test. If another T-Go is required, Det 5, AFRL SOCC will
       reinitiate T-Go notifications.
       11.4.2.6. Test (T-0): Det 5, AFRL SOCC shall notify SPORT, DOWNFALL, Tower and
       Range ODO that the test has occurred.
       11.4.2.7. All Clear (T+All Clear): Det 5, AFRL SOCC shall notify SPORT,
       DOWNFALL, Tower and Range ODO that the test is complete and airspace restrictions
       can be cancelled.
       11.4.2.8. In the event a condition should arise which could jeopardize the safety of the
       test (e.g., Inflight emergency over PIRA, lost personnel, potential intrusion into exclusion
       area etc.) immediate action shall be taken by the agency identifying the problem to notify
       Det 7, AFRL SOCC to “hold” the test. Testing shall not resume until such time as the
       hazardous condition has terminated.
11.5. Borax Mine Blasting. High explosive blasting routinely occurs at the Borax mine (open
pit) near Boron. Avoid flight below 4,500’ MSL within a 1/2 mile area from the west-north-east
perimeter of the mine and 1-1/4 miles south of the mine pit.
11.6. Inoperative Transponder. Advise the controlling agency of the situation and attempt an
equipment reset as soon as possible. Terminate the mission and Return to Base (RTB) providing
position reports if system reset is not possible. JOSHUA will not provide separation from
participating traffic. The aircraft must RTB unless controlling agency approves otherwise.
   11.6.1. SPORT may, on a real-time basis depending on traffic within R-2515, allow an
   aircraft to continue operations with an inoperative transponder. If a suitable location cannot
   be located based on traffic, the aircraft will be directed to sterile airspace (e.g., Alpha
   Corridor/West Range/East Range).
   11.6.2. 412 OG/CC may approve special exceptions within R-2515 provided aircrews adhere
   to procedures contained in the FLIP General Planning. Aircrews will brief SPORT on
   special exceptions before departure.

11.8. Weather Recall Areas (Fig 11. 6.). Five areas within R-2515 and R-2508 (Isabella and
Panamint Work Areas) have been identified to be recalled in the event severe weather requires
route deviations by aircraft operating in the National Airspace System. These areas will only be
released to the FAA after coordinating with users and may be recalled from the FAA with a 20
minute notice.
   11.8.1. JOSHUA will request the airspace (weather area) to include altitudes required and
   estimated duration. Altitudes for weather areas will be as coordinated.
   11.8.2. SPORT will determine if airspace may be released back to the FAA based on active
   and scheduled missions. If the AFTC flying schedule indicates a mission conflict with the
   FAA request, SPORT shall coordinate with the affected organization(s). If the airspace
   release disrupts flight tests, the 412 OG/CC will make the final decision concerning airspace
   release.
   11.8.3. The weather areas are:
       11.8.3.1. Weather Area 1 encompasses R-2515 east of the China Lake (NID) 152 radial.
       11.8.3.2. Weather Area 2 is west of the NID 152 radial to the western boundary of R-
       2515. NOTE: Hwy 395 falls along the NID 152° radial providing a visual reference
       dividing Weather Areas 1 & 2. Coordinates are: N35°21.41’ W117°35.57’ to N34°51.23’
       W117°26.65’.
       11.8.3.3. Weather Area 3 is that portion of the complex west of the PMD 330 radial.
       Although the radial follows no visible landmarks, a viable reference is a line extending
       from Mojave, Kernville, to the southwestern corner of the Owens Work Area or the
       northwest corner of the Isabella Work Area. Coordinates are: N3448.66’ W11807.62’ to
       N3607.99’ W118°35.05’.
       11.8.3.4. Weather Area 4 overlies the Panamint MOA east of the BTY 182 radial. The
       radial follows the eastern slopes of the Panamint Range. Aircrews should remain west of
       the Panamint Range to avoid the area. Coordinates are: N3626.06’ W11653.13’ to
       N3547.78’ W11707.25’.
       11.8.3.5. Weather Area 5 is defined by the Fillmore (FIM) 049 radial and the area south
       of the radial to the boundary of R-2515. Boundary coordinates where the radial intersects
       the boundary of R-2515 are N3448.01’ W11747.47’ and N3511.05’ W11649.05’.
11.9. Multiple Aircraft Operations. Test or training missions with greater than 1v1 limited or
unlimited maneuvering (ACM, Intercept, ACBT) will utilize airspace IAW Attachment 8. Test
or training missions with more than 4 aircraft will utilize the airspace IAW Attachment 8

regardless of maneuver category. Test or training missions with up to 4 aircraft are excluded
from these requirements if the target maneuvers are scripted or restricted (as defined by AFI 11-
214) The OG/CC is the waiver authority for this paragraph.
11.10. Fuel Dumping Procedures. Do not dump fuel within the R-2508 Complex except when
emergency or test requirements dictate.
   11.10.1. Conduct emergency/test fuel           dumping     above    10,000'    AGL     unless
   condition/situation warrants exception.
   11.10.2. Notify JOSHUA or SPORT of intention, altitude, location, and termination.

      12.4.3.1. Flights remaining within the R-2508 Complex boundaries.
          12.4.3.1.1. Schedule R-2502E and Barstow East FL300 and above when needed for
          additional airspace. Otherwise, expect delays from Los Angeles Air Route Traffic
          Control Center (ARTCC). Supersonic flight within the R-2508 boundaries (Entry
          #1/Exit #1) requires no advance notification.
          12.4.3.1.2. Contact controlling/monitoring facility (SPORT or JOSHUA) at least 15
          minutes prior to airspace time when Daggett Shelf (R-2502E and Barstow East FL240
          and above) is required.
          12.4.3.1.3. Before entering supersonic corridor, specify Entry #1/Exit #1, number of
          runs, direction of flight and altitudes.
          12.4.3.1.4. Obtain over-flight altitudes for R-2502N and R-2524 from JOSHUA or
          SPORT as required.
          12.4.3.1.5. Advise JOSHUA or SPORT when mission is complete.
      12.4.3.2. Flights exiting the R-2508 Complex boundaries shall coordinate proposed
      supersonic flight with Los Angeles ARTCC (661-265-8287) at least one hour prior to
      takeoff. If possible, coordinate one day prior to scheduled mission and provide the
      following information as listed in Table 12.1.
      12.4.3.3. Supersonic flight should be planned for 0700L to 0930L and 1230L to 1500L
      daily to minimize excessive restrictions. Supersonic flight outside the R-2508 Complex
      at FL390 and above can normally expect minimal restrictions.

       12.4.3.4. Los Angeles ARTCC will accommodate requests outside R-2508 to the
       maximum extent possible based on traffic conditions. However, due to high-density
       enroute traffic, the corridor extending west beyond the boundary of the R-2508 Complex
       (entry/exit point 3) shall only be used when absolutely required.
       12.4.3.5. Unless mission essential and specifically approved, the entry and/or exit phases
       of the route outside the R-2508 Complex shall be conducted under the control of Los
       Angeles Center at air traffic control assigned altitudes. Normally, expect frequency
       change to SPORT or JOSHUA at or prior to the entry point and to re-contact center prior
       to the exit point (except on Exit #1).
       12.4.3.6. Upon receiving the Supersonic request from the Range Control Officer (RCO),
       the Los Angeles ARTCC Military Operations Specialist (MOS) will file the flight plan.
       Center will enter the R-2508 Complex exit altitude as the requested altitude of the flight
       plan. In the remarks section, Center will enter the block altitudes requested. Plan an
       altitude above FL370 enroute to corridor entry or exiting the corridor for return to R-
       2508. Fill out DD-175 and maintain in dispatch section but do not file through Airfield
       Management.
       12.4.3.7. Receipt of a flight data strip by SPORT or JOSHUA constitutes Center
       approval. Any special air traffic control requirements will be coordinated with
       JOSHUA/SPORT.
       12.4.3.8. Advise JOSHUA or SPORT when scheduled supersonic flight is canceled or
       delayed by 30 minutes or more. Delayed flights may require re-coordination with the
       Traffic Management Unit.
       12.4.3.9. Notify JOSHUA or SPORT 10 minutes prior to R-2508 exit time with
       supersonic corridor request.
       12.4.3.10. Whenever a chase aircraft becomes separated by more than 1 NM laterally or
       100’ vertically from the lead, the pilot will immediately squawk code normal with mode
       C encoded.
       12.4.3.11. Remain south of corridor centerline on a ground track approximately between
       North Base and Main Base when the North Spin is active above FL300. If using
       Entry/Exit #1 eastbound, use a ground track over Mojave to Main Base then continue
       east.

       question(s).
13.4. Emergency Response/Communication Procedures. The crew will, time permitting,
provide JOSHUA or SPORT the information as listed in Table 13.3. If conditions permit, crews
will inform the SOF of situation and/or request technical assistance via SOF mission frequency
(UHF 308.7/VHF 143.1). If a technical assistance frequency (TAF) is needed, non-test aircraft
within R-2515 will normally use Edwards SOF frequency (308.7). For test aircraft requiring a
TAF, either the SOF frequency or the test aircraft’s mission frequency may be used as the TAF.
   13.4.1. Once an emergency aircraft lands, pilots can expect frequency assignment to 353.6
   (Ch 19) for direct communications with the incident commander.
   13.4.2. Pilots who require a single frequency approach will be assigned frequency 353.6 (Ch
   19) by the control tower.
   13.4.3. Tower will activate the PCAS and relay all known information.

   13.4.7. The flying organization’s CC or authorized representative (may be a contractor)
   provides technical assistance upon request.
   13.4.8. Tower/AMOPS will use the Ramp/Crash FM Nets to communicate with emergency
   vehicles once they are deployed to standby positions. Other agencies use the Ramp/Crash
   Nets to accomplish coordination and relay follow-up information. Tower will broadcast on
   all ground control frequencies except Guard when emergency aircraft is next to land. Tower
   will instruct the IFE pilot to contact incident commander on UHF 353.6 or another frequency
   as directed by tower.
   13.4.9. The Senior On-Scene Fire Official is the final authority on emergency termination
   and fire/crash equipment release. The Senior On-Scene Fire Official shall notify Tower of
   emergency termination via Ramp/Crash FM Net.
13.5. Hydrazine (H-70) Areas (Fig 13. 1.). When an aircraft with an unscheduled activated
EPU lands or an aircraft EPU has activated on the ground, has a leak and/or leak contamination,
declare a ground emergency. An airstart mission (scheduled activation) does not require an IFE
declaration. If a leak/contamination is found after landing, a ground emergency will be declared.
   13.5.1. After landing, Tower will advise the crew of departure end wind conditions. For
   Taxiway Delta provide Rwy 22 approach end winds.
   13.5.2. Aircraft with an activated EPU can recover at Rwy 04R/22L and 04L/22R
   hammerheads or for any lakebed runway at Taxiway Delta. Taxiway Bravo shall only be
   used if the departure end hammerhead has on-going activities.
   13.5.3. Crews shall:
       13.5.3.1. Taxi to the designated parking spot (if possible) and park with the left wing into
       the wind at a 45-degree angle.
       13.5.3.2. Keep canopy closed, visor down, mask up and maintain 100% oxygen. Crew
       will turn off the EPU and follow Hydrazine Response Team (HRT) and Senior Fire
       Official directions. The HRT/Senior Fire Official will establish visual or radio
       communications using UHF 353.6 or as directed by Tower.
       13.5.3.3. HRT will secure the aircraft and conduct an initial visual inspection for
       hydrazine leaks. HRT/Senior Fire Official will inform the aircrew of leak/contamination
       status and direct engine shutdown. After shutdown, HRT will pin the EPU. Leave
       canopy closed (until directed to egress by HRT) and mask up.
       13.5.3.4. After opening the canopy, regardless of leak status, HRT will provide portable
       oxygen bottles for the aircrew during egress. The portable oxygen bottle has the same
       connections as the aircraft life support system.
   13.5.4. The aircraft will be towed to the appropriate spot.
   13.5.5. Routine hydrazine maintenance will be performed on the Gun Butt (Pad 6) or
   Taxiway Delta.
   13.5.6. See EAFBI 21-209, Hydrazine Response Procedures and 412 TW Viper Guide for

13.6. Hot Brakes and Procedures. Air/ground crews experiencing/suspecting hot brakes shall
declare an emergency with the Tower and provide aircraft identification, type and location.
Crews will accomplish the appropriate Tech Order emergency procedures. (Crew safety is
paramount. If a fire develops, consider immediate engine shutdown and egress). Normally, the
crew should continue to the end of the runway and taxi to the designated hot brake areas
(22L/04R hammerheads). Park so that the wind will blow any flames/smoke away from the
cockpit and help cool the brakes. (Refer to Fig 4.4.)
   13.6.1. If exiting at the center taxiway, the crew will stop the aircraft after clearing the
   runway. If past the designated hot brake area, the crew will taxi to the nearest uncongested
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                   153


   area and stop. In either situation, stop the aircraft so the sides of the wheels are not facing any
   other aircraft in the area.
   13.6.2. If hot brakes are discovered after arriving in the parking area, the crew will declare a
   ground emergency with Ground Control and taxi to an uncongested area. The crew chief will
   notify the airfield expediter of the problem and monitor the aircraft for possible tire/brake
   fire. The airfield expediter will radio the aircraft location to the ROC who will ensure that a
   ground emergency has been declared.
   13.6.3. If a hot brake aircraft blocks the center taxiway, Tower will cease operations on the
   taxiway until notified the danger of a blown tire, etc., has passed.
   13.6.4. The aircraft should be chocked as soon as it is safe so brake pressure may be released
   to aid cooling and help prevent fusing. Fire and Crash Rescue personnel will provide
   standby support during brake cooling.
   13.6.5. Ensure fire support/response equipment is in place before shutdown if the aircraft
   may vent fuel upon shutdown.
   13.6.6. All support vehicles, except Crash Recovery and Fire and Crash Rescue, will remain
   at least 300’ from an aircraft with hot brakes.
13.7. Personnel/Crash Locator Beacon Signal/Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT)
Response Procedures. Tower will notify SPORT, JOSHUA and AMOPS when an ELT signal
is received or terminated.
   13.7.1. AMOPS will activate checklist to ascertain if the ELT is originating from the
   airfield. The 412 TW/CP assumes responsibility when AMOPS is closed.
   13.7.2. The ATC Tower will contact Frequency Management who will attempt to locate the
   ELT. If no one is available at the location to deactivate the ELT, Frequency Management
   will contact the ROC who will recall the appropriate individual to assist in deactivating the
   ELT. Frequency Management will contact the ROC and AMOPS or 412 TW/CP (when
   AMOPS is closed) upon termination of the ELT.
   13.7.3. Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE), when notified, will search its shop for the
   activated ELT and if found, immediately deactivate and report ELT termination to AMOPS
   or 412 TW/CP when AMOPS is closed. AFE personnel will remain at their building until
   AMOPS/412 TW/CP confirms the ELT is terminated.
   13.7.4. The ROC, when notified, will contact the Survival Equipment Shop, Egress Shop
   and Line Trucks. Each will check their respective area for the ELT. Upon completion of
   check, each shop will contact the ROC with the results. ROC will then contact AMOPS or
   412 TW/CP and report findings.
   13.7.5. Planned ELT/Survival Radio Tests. ELT testing is authorized during the first 5
   minutes of each hour. Operators will advise AMOPS or 412 TW/CP of test duration times
   (start/end) and the test location prior to keying survival radios on UHF 243.0 or VHF 121.5
   for a test, lecture or demonstration. Do not key the transmitter for more than three audible
   sweeps.

13.8. Lost Communications.
   13.8.1. ATC/SPORT MRU will declare an emergency when communication (i.e. receiver
   only acknowledgement) cannot be established with airborne, single aircraft (no
   wingman/chase).
   13.8.2. Fixed Wing crews shall:
       13.8.2.1. Set transponder to 7600 and follow radio out procedures as published in the
       412 TW In-flight Guide.
       13.8.2.2. Monitor VHF 121.5/UHF 243.0.
       13.8.2.3. During VMC, ascertain landing direction prior to entering the traffic pattern by
       over flying Edwards at or above 6,000' MSL. Enter initial at 3,300' MSL for the runway
       in use midway between the runway and Tower Flyby Line, rocking wings during daylight
       or flashing landing lights at night and break at departure end. Observe Tower for light
       gun signals.
       13.8.2.4. If IMC is encountered, proceed to the IAF for Rwy 22L, execute one turn in
       holding and commence approach. If Rwy 04R is the active runway, execute the approach
       to Rwy 22L and circle to land Rwy 04R.
13.9. Lost or Overdue Aircraft. The ROC is responsible for notifying AMOPS when an
aircraft within the Edwards scheduling system has exceeded its ETA by 30 minutes.
13.10. Evacuation of Airfield Operations Facilities:
   13.10.1. AMOPS Facility. When necessary to evacuate Bldg 1202, AMOPS will:
       13.10.1.1. Evacuate to the base of the Tower or alternate Tower. Fly-away kits will be
       taken with personnel when relocating.
       13.10.1.2. Vehicle staging will be positioned on the airfield in close proximity to the
       alternate locations. Aircraft delays should be expected until operations may resume.
       13.10.1.3. AMOPS personnel will conclude actions IAW the Facility Evacuation Quick
       Reference Checklist.
   13.10.2. Alternate Control Tower Operations and Tower Wind Limitations. Tower
   personnel will evacuate when the surface wind velocity reaches a sustained speed of 80 mph
   (70 knots) or gusts up to 100 mph (87 knots). In the event of a Tower evacuation the PCAS
   will be utilized by Tower personnel to inform associated agencies of the evacuation (Para
   13.3.1.11). The following general procedures will be utilized by Tower personnel when
   evacuating to the Alternate Control Tower on Fire Station One. A detailed list of actions and
   responsibilities are published in 412 OSS Tower OI 13-2, Facility Management.
       13.10.2.1. Tower shall make a blanket broadcast on all frequencies, stating, "Attention
       all aircraft, Edwards Tower is being evacuated, all airborne aircraft contact
       SPORT/JOSHUA. All aircraft exit and remain off runway. Taxiing aircraft hold
       position until further advised." Make a similar broadcast on the FM Nets (Crash
       Net/Trunk Net/government cell phones).
       13.10.2.2. Airfield lighting will be set to “pilot controlled” (Para. 4.4).

                UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEM (UAS) OPERATIONS

14.1. Overview. This chapter establishes the additional instructional guidance for conducting
Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) operations from Edwards AFB and within Restricted Area
R-2515. Instructions in this chapter augment instructions contained in other chapters of this
document. UAS pilots must abide by the overall guidance contained in this instruction – not
solely this chapter.
   14.1.1. The procedures in this instruction apply to locally assigned UAS/UAS test programs,
   NASA/NASA sponsored UAS programs and UAS operations transiting R-2515.
   14.1.2. UAS operations not listed above shall be covered in an LOA.
14.2. Definitions.
   14.2.1. UAS: A powered, aircraft that does not carry a human operator; uses aerodynamic
   forces to provide vehicle lift; can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely; can be
   expendable or recoverable and can carry a lethal or non-lethal payload. Ballistic or semi
   ballistic vehicles, cruise missiles, and artillery projectiles are not considered an unmanned
   aircraft system.
   14.2.2. Sense and Avoid: Detection of other aircraft, personnel or obstruction (airborne and
   ground) that will potentially be a factor to the UAS operation. This information is displayed
   to the UAS pilot in a manner that makes it easy to interpret the severity of the potential
   conflict and decide on an appropriate avoidance course of action.
   14.2.3. Lost Link: When the ground control segment loses command and control data link
   with the aircraft. Mitigation procedures will be evaluated by the SRB for the specific
   aircraft. An example of such a mitigating procedure would be for the aircraft to go to an
   autonomous orbit and then recover automatically based on time or fuel.
   14.2.4. UAS pilot: Individual directly responsible for the UAS’s flight path.
   14.2.5. Cooperative Traffic: Aircraft in direct communication with air traffic control (ATC),
   or military radar unit (MRU) controllers and on an assigned Mode 3 beacon code.
   14.2.6. Non-Cooperative traffic: Aircraft not in direct communication with ATC or MRU
   controllers and/or not squawking a Mode 3 beacon code.
14.3. Coordination and Relationship to Test Package
   14.3.1. The testing and operation of unmanned air vehicles can often involve unique hazard
   considerations. These considerations are directly related to the type of UAS, the planned
   operations and the level of maturity of the air vehicle. The AFTC Safety Review Board, via
   a Test Safety Package, and subsequent commander’s approval establish the types of
   mitigation procedures required and may vary throughout a test program.
   14.3.2. UAS programs shall coordinate Test Safety Package requirements to include type
   designation, and appropriate mitigation requirements described below, through the 412
   OG/CC for procedural integration into R-2515 operations.
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                                157


   14.3.3. Requests for unpublished exclusive use airspace for UAS operations within R-2515
   shall be coordinated at least 14 days in advance through R-2515 Airspace Management.
   14.3.4. UAS operations on Rosamond/Rogers lakebeds when tower and SPORT are closed
   require prior approval from 412 OG/CC.
   14.3.5. Additional mitigation procedures will be communicated to ATC (JOSHUA),
   SPORT, Tower and other aircrews as required through FCIFs, NOTAMs or LOAs.
   14.3.6. To simplify this process and provide standard terminology, the following standard
   mitigation procedures can be referenced. Variations or deviations from these standard
   definitions should be clearly defined and documented in the approved test package and
   subsequent FCIF/NOTAM/etc.
14.4. Type Designation. A UAS will be assigned a type designation by the AFTC Safety
Review Board will assign a type designation to each UAS. Traffic avoidance capability is an
important consideration for type designation and may be accomplished via on-board or off-board
systems. Capability must be tested for suitability before it can be considered for categorizing the
UAS.
   14.4.1. Type 1: UAS has the ability to conduct sense and avoid to an equivalent level of
   capability as a manned aircraft (cooperative and non-cooperative traffic).
   14.4.2. Type 2: UAS able to detect factor traffic (cooperative only) and take appropriate
   avoidance action in a timely manner (usually within a few seconds). The detection to action
   decision loop only involves the UAS and the operator.
   14.4.3. Type 3: UAS able to detect factor traffic (cooperative only), but unable to react in a
   timely manner (usually within a few seconds). This delay may be due to detection method
   (ATC traffic monitoring, Chase aircraft) and/or latency inherent in UAS system (long link
   delays, complicated command sequences).
   14.4.4. Type 4: UAS unable to deviate from flight path for traffic avoidance. ATC may be
   able to detect the conflict and direct the conflicting traffic to maneuver (ATC transponder
   required).
   14.4.5. Type 5: UAS unable to deviate from flight path for traffic avoidance and ATC
   unable to accurately track a UAS to detect traffic conflicts (no transponder).
14.5. Hazard Mitigation
   14.5.1. Flight (See and Avoid) Mitigation
       14.5.1.1. Exclusive Use Airspace (EUA): Airspace dedicated to the sole use of the UAS
       mission. SPORT is responsible for directing non-participant traffic to avoid entering and
       advising the UAS pilot if there is an airspace incursion. UAS operations are required to
       remain within the confines of the airspace boundaries. Examples include PIRA and
       Alpha Corridor.
       14.5.1.2. Airspace bubble (BA): Aircrews shall remain clear of any UAS by 2000’
       vertical and 5 NM horizontal airspace bubble around the UAS. Exception: Chase aircraft
       are exempt from this requirement.
158                                                EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013


      14.5.1.2.1. The BA is not required for UAS operations flying with a chase aircraft
      providing see and avoid functions.
         14.5.1.2.2. SPORT is responsible for advising traffic of the current direction of flight
         and altitude of UAS. SPORT will then recommend a direction or altitude change to
         protect the BA. The UAS pilot will be prepared to make avoidance maneuver if
         required.
         14.5.1.2.3. Once a UAS is established in Rosamond North/South UAS Areas, the
         Four Corners UAS Work Area, PIRA and/or the North Base UAS Special Use
         Airspace, to include the transition airspace between the North Base UAS and PIRA,
         the BA will terminate. BA is only valid in R-2515 outside the aforementioned areas.
         14.5.1.2.4. Tower cannot provide separation services for BA for aircraft on final
         approach or inbound aircraft outside Class Delta Airspace. The BA shall be
         maintained by SPORT until the UAS enters Class Delta Airspace.
         14.5.1.2.5. Departures shall receive BA separation services from SPORT once they
         depart Class Delta Airspace.
         14.5.1.2.6. Inside Class Delta Airspace
             14.5.1.2.6.1. BA cannot be maintained within Class Delta airspace. If EUA
             airspace is needed, the Class Delta shall be sanitized of other operations.
             Coordination to sanitize Class Delta operations shall be coordinated at least 72
             hours in advance.
             14.5.1.2.6.2. Controllers will not instruct UAS pilots to visually follow another
             aircraft. Exception: A UAS flying with a chase aircraft providing see and avoid
             functions.
             14.5.1.2.6.3. Use of visual separation between UAS pilots and UAS pilots and
             manned aircraft is not authorized. Tower shall provide positive control
             instructions to ensure appropriate landing sequence and runway separation.
             14.5.1.2.6.4. If applicable the UAS pilot will notify Tower of planned go around
             altitude.
      14.5.1.3. Chase aircraft (CA): Primary purpose may be to conduct see and avoid for both
      the UAS and the chase aircraft. If the chase aircraft is providing see and avoid functions,
      they will advise the UAS pilot of all traffic conflicts and recommend or direct a course of
      action as appropriate.
      14.5.1.4. Traffic Avoidance (TA): UAS pilot depends on ATC active monitoring to
      detect traffic and advise UAS pilot of all traffic conflicts and recommended avoidance
      maneuver.
      14.5.1.5. Ground Hazard Mitigation.
         14.5.1.5.1. Test programs will use the ground hazard mitigation procedures described
         below as necessary and as specified by the Safety Board.
         14.5.1.5.2. Sanitized ground footprint (FS): Geographic area on the ground actively
         cleared of all personnel. Risk is accepted to structures and vehicles remaining within
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                         159


        the footprint in case of an aircraft crash. Flight path is planned to afford the
        maximum practical protection for personnel. Example: PIRA, Echo Range, other
        bombing ranges.
        14.5.1.5.3. Limited ground footprint (FLG): Geographic area on the ground with
        widely dispersed population and/or structures. Flight path is planned to minimize
        personnel risk exposure. Example: The corner of R-2515 north of Hwy 58 and east
        of Hwy 395, or flight planning to avoid designated population areas.
        14.5.1.5.4. Takeoff exclusion zone (TE): Designated zone around takeoff runway to
        minimize risk to personnel, aircraft and equipment from a takeoff accident. Active
        procedures are utilized to prevent non-participating personnel from being within the
        exclusion zone.
        14.5.1.5.5. Landing exclusion zone (LE): Designated zone around landing runway to
        minimize risk to personnel, aircraft and equipment from a landing accident. Active
        procedures are utilized to prevent non-participating personnel from being within the
        exclusion zone.
        14.5.1.5.6. Road closure (RC): Closure of roads the UAS ground track crosses to
        minimize risk to drivers and their vehicles. Active procedures are utilized to stop
        traffic at a safe distance from the UAS ground track. Examples include Lancaster
        Blvd and Mercury Blvd.
     14.5.1.6. Airfield Conflict Avoidance.
        14.5.1.6.1. Test programs will use the airfield conflict avoidance procedures
        described below as necessary and as specified by the Safety Board.
        14.5.1.6.2. Sanitized Taxi Route (ST): Taxi route from engine start location to
        runway is sanitized of all non-participant aircraft, ground vehicles and personnel.
        14.5.1.6.3. Safety Ground Chase vehicle (SGC): Primary purpose is to monitor UAS
        ground operations/taxi for conflicts with aircraft, personnel and structures. The
        Safety Ground Chase vehicle will advise the UAS pilot of all traffic conflicts and
        recommend or direct a course of action as appropriate.
        14.5.1.6.4. Lakebed takeoff (LBT): UAS takeoff restricted to approved/coordinated
        lakebed surfaces only. (Specify planned lakebed(s)).
        14.5.1.6.5. Lakebed landing (LBL): UAS landing restricted to approved/coordinated
        lakebed surfaces only. (Specify planned lakebed(s)).

   14.6. Lost Link Procedures.
         14.6.1. Lost Link profiles: UAS pilot shall forward lost link profiles to Air Traffic Control
         (Tower/SPORT/TRACON) and AOF/CC/DO NLT 72 hours prior to mission execution for
         each flight unless otherwise coordinated via an LOA, COA or LOP.
              14.6.1.1. Tower will not activate the PCAS or request rescue service for lost link UAS
              aircraft unless the pilot/operator declares an emergency. An UAS pilot may declare an
              emergency via voice communication or by squawking “7700” and following pre-
              coordinated lost link procedures.
              14.6.1.2. PCAS activation: The PCAS shall be activated as if an emergency is declared.
              14.6.1.3. Notify ATC immediately of the following (if applicable):
                 14.6.1.3.1. Time of Lost Link
                 14.6.1.3.2. Last known Position
                 14.6.1.3.3. Altitude
                 14.6.1.3.4. Direction of Flight
                 14.6.1.3.5. Confirmed execution of lost link
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                               161


          14.6.1.3.6. Confirmed visual contact of UAS
14.7. Chase Vehicles
   14.7.1. Chase vehicles may request simultaneous access to the runway with their UAS for
   departures and arrivals. The UAS and chase vehicle will be considered a formation during
   ground operations. If a request for simultaneous access is granted by the tower, operators are
   solely responsible for the separation of vehicles and aircraft within their formation.
   14.7.2. Departures: Chase vehicles are automatically cleared onto the runway when their
   assigned aircraft is cleared onto the runway.
       14.7.2.1. Chase vehicles shall exit the runway at the next available taxiway or as directed
       by Tower.
   14.7.3. Arrivals: Chase vehicles shall request runway entry from Tower, while still holding
   short of the runway at the approach end in a position to conduct a “run in” on the landing
   aircraft. One their assigned UAS aircraft is cleared to land, the chase vehicle is approved
   access to rejoin the landing aircraft at their discretion based on operational need.
       14.7.3.1. Any additional chase vehicles holding short of the runway at any other entry
       point other than the approach end, will continue to hold short until Tower gives specific
       approval to access the runway to rejoin the UAS after landing.
       14.7.3.2. Tower will suspend runway operations to the runway being used once the
       aircraft receives a clearance to land. Runway operations will remain suspended until all
       vehicles report off the runway.
14.8. Communication.
   14.8.1. Communication with ATC and/or SPORT is required for all UAS operations within
   R-2515.
   14.8.2. Communication shall be on primary or alternate ATC frequencies unless otherwise
   coordinated. Examples of other approved means of communication include calling
   tower/SPORT landlines, LMR, pre-coordinated automated methods.
   14.8.3. An initial communication check shall be accomplished between the UAS pilot (Via
   voice pass-through if available) and ATC prior to commencing operations.
   14.8.4. UAS operators conducting multiple launches within Rosamond North/South UAS
   areas, North UAS Area, ROA Corridor, Four Corners or PIRA will notify Tower/SPORT at
   the beginning and end of each individual launch to allow for real-time airspace de-
   confliction.
14.9. Emergency Recall of Airspace: In the event of an emergency that requires the use of
EUA being occupied by a UAS. ATC or SPORT will coordinate with the UAS pilot to have the
UAS move to other available mission airspace. If other mission airspace is not available or the
UAS does not meet mitigation requirements for BA, the UAS will be instructed to return to base.
14.10. NOTAM Requirements: The responsible agency must coordinate UAS operations with
Airfield Management at least 72 hours in advance or no later than 24 hours prior to scheduled
mission to publish applicable NOTAMS.
 162                                                EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013


   14.10.1. NOTAMS are not required for a UAS who will operate in Rosamond North/South
   UAS areas, North UAS area, ROA corridor, Four Corners UAS Area or PIRA. These areas
   will be scheduled via CSE and de-conflicted real-time with ATC and SPORT. Exception: A
   NOTAM may be required if Tower/SPORT is closed.
   14.10.2. A NOTAM is required for UAS’s conducing operations outside of published UAS
   areas.
14.11. Automated Terminal Information Service (ATIS): Tower shall update the ATIS to
reflect when UAS operations are conducted and when they terminate.
   14.11.1. An “Unmanned Aircraft Operations are in Progress” advisory shall be included
   once a UAS requests to taxi or launch and 15 minutes prior to its estimated time of arrival.
   14.11.2. Individual flying units will pre-coordinate any additional operational requirements
   with Airfield Operations Flight at least 14 days prior to the planned operation to ensure
   proper training/coordination.
14.12. R-2515 Entry and Exit Procedures for UASs.
   14.12.1. The following points are identified for entry/exit of R-2515 for all UAS platforms

       15.2.2.2. All other hazard division munitions not previously discussed (HD 1.1 – 1.3)
       will be loaded/downloaded at the respective EOR arm/de-arm areas located in the runway
       hammerheads as identified in Fig 15.5.
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                               167


       15.2.2.3. All munitions safing pins will remain installed until aircraft goes through an
       End of Runway (EOR) inspection at the primary/alternate EOR arm/de-arm areas
       identified in Fig 15.5.
15.3. Ground Operations Involving Munitions.
   15.3.1. The primary EOR arm/de-arm area for live munitions is the 22L hammerhead and
   the alternate is the 04R hammerhead (Fig 15.5). Collectively, these areas will be referred to
   as EOR arm/de-arm areas. Aircraft with forward firing munitions or hot guns must park
   heading 040 on 22L hammerhead and 220˚ when using 04R hammerhead.
   15.3.2. The EORs are not authorized for concurrent operations of AECPA and CAPA
   operations.
   15.3.3. For inert and training munitions (including chaff/flares), arm in EOR arming areas.
   15.3.4. If an aircraft has been armed with forward firing ordnance (rockets, missiles, gun,
   etc) and then must taxi an extensive distance for takeoff the crew will taxi as far as
   practicable from personnel and equipment while trying to minimize the amount of time the
   aircraft nose is pointed at base assets. When armed with live free fall ordnance taxi as far as
   practicable from personnel and equipment. For example, if armed in 22L EOR and a 04R
   takeoff is required, advise ground control and request back taxi down 22R to enter 04R at
   taxiway Alpha.

Figure 15.5. EOR Arm/De-Arm Load/Unload Areas
15.4. In-Flight Operations Involving Munitions.
   15.4.1. All flights involving live munitions should originate and terminate at main base.
   Except in an emergency, do not land at North Base, South Base or the lakebed runways when
   carrying munitions or returning from missions expending munitions.
   15.4.2. Make a straight-in approach to landing when carrying external expendable ordnance.
   15.4.3. Overhead Approaches. The straight-in approach restrictions are waived if the flight
   test requires overhead approaches with munitions/stores. Overhead patterns may be flown
   with the following external stores:
       15.4.3.1. External fuel and tanks.
       15.4.3.2. Stores, other than vertical drop munitions, secured to the aircraft and not
       intended to be jettisoned or dropped (e.g. instrumentation pods, gun pods, baggage pods,
       empty rocket pods, aerodynamic shapes, and ARDs pods).
       15.4.3.3. Forward firing missiles, if no attempt has been made to fire.
       15.4.3.4. Unexpended BDU-33s.
       15.4.3.5. Captive Carry Munitions.
   15.4.4. If hung flares are suspected, return using hung munitions procedures and shut down
   the aircraft in EOR.
15.5. After Landing Procedures. All aircraft that required munitions arming prior to flight will
go thru EOR de-arm after landing. There is no need to go thru EOR de-arm for CATMs, fuel
tanks, inert TGMs that are not carted, etc.
 168                                                EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013


15.6. Diverted Munitions Loaded Aircraft. Tower will notify AMOPS of any known, non-
emergency aircraft diversions into Edwards, which are carrying munitions. AMOPS will notify
agencies as required. Forward type, quantity of munitions and stations loaded when provided by
the pilot. Paragraph 15.2. above will be used as a guide when parking diverted or transient
aircraft.
15.7. Unexpended Munitions Landing Procedures.
   15.7.1. Land from a straight-in approach except as stated in Paragraph 15.4.3.
   15.7.2. All aircraft with forward firing ordnance will go thru EOR de-arm and park heading
   040 degrees when de-arming at the end of runway 22L and 220 degrees when de-arming at
   the end of runway 04R.
   15.7.3. Unless weapons load crews are pre-briefed the time and location (EOR de-arm area
   or alternate EOR de-arm area) of recovery de-arming inform CONFORM (UHF 304.0) of
   ETA.
15.7.4. Once in the appropriate de-arm area ensure all switches are in the Off/Safe/Normal
position and raise both hands in full view of the weapons load crew until safing is completed.
   15.7.5. Aircraft with live munitions loaded internally will taxi to the primary EOR de-arm
   area (heading 040°) or the alternate arm/de-arm load/unload area (heading 220°) with the
   weapons bay doors closed. Ensure switches are Off/Safe/Normal and shut down the aircraft.
   15.7.6. Park munitions loaded transient aircraft at the primary or alternate hot gun line until
   type of munitions can be determined.
   15.7.7. If munitions safing pins/devices cannot be installed, the munitions are hung. Stop
   safing and call weapons/EOD immediately. Follow hung munitions procedures (paragraph
   15.8).
   15.7.8. After safing, taxi to the appropriate parking/downloading area.
15.8. Hung Munitions Landing Procedures (Includes hung flares). If you cannot positively
determine all intended munitions have been released/fired, assume hung munitions, return to the
de-arm area and follow hung munitions procedures.
   15.8.1. Land from a straight-in approach. The primary recovery runway (winds permitting)
   for hung free fall ordnance is 22L/R. The primary recovery runway (winds permitting) for
   forward firing ordnance is 04R/L. Declare an emergency for all hung munitions.
       15.8.1.1. If landing on Rwy 22 with forward firing ordnance is required make a 180° left
       turn at the 4,000’ remaining marker to maintain a maximum safe distance to South Base
       and Lancaster Blvd. Taxi northeast on the active runway to the primary EOR de-arm
       area (heading 040).
   15.8.2. Notify tower of the type of hung munitions. CONFORM notifies weapons/EOD
   when an emergency is declared. MOC notifies weapons loading personnel to respond to the
   designated end of the runway.
   15.8.3. When live internally loaded munitions are hung, taxi to the Hot Gun Line de-arm
   area (heading 040) or the alternate arm/de-arm area (heading 220°) with the weapons bay
   doors closed (aircraft with jammed guns will use the Hot Gun Line). Ensure switches are
EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013                                                              169


   Off/Safe/Normal and shut down the aircraft. This also applies to aircraft suspecting hung
   flares (taxi to the de-arm area and shut down).
   15.8.4. Once on the Hot Gun Line or applicable arm/de-arm area, ensure all switches are
   Off/Safe and raise both hands in full view of weapons loading personnel.
   15.8.5. Hung munitions and unsafe munitions indications in the cockpit should be verified
   by weapons loading personnel at the de-arm area. If weapons personnel cannot safe the
   munitions, weapons will safe all other stations, and the crew will shut down the aircraft and
   request EOD thru CONFORM or the command post. When safed, weapons/ EOD informs
   the aircrew and releases the aircraft to the weapons load crew or contractor loading
   personnel.
   15.8.6. When safed, taxi or tow the aircraft to the appropriate download area. Taxi or tow
   any aircraft containing internally loaded stores to the desired unloading area with the
   weapons bay doors closed. F-22 and F-35 weapons bay doors may remain open.
15.9. Hung Munitions Ground Procedures (Includes flares and jammed guns).
   15.9.1. MOC notifies applicable weapons loading personnel to respond to the designated end
   of the runway.
   15.9.2. Once on the Hot Gun Line or applicable arm/de-arm area, weapons loading crew
   chief will ensure all armaments switches are OFF, Safe or Normal and have aircrew raise
   both hands in full view of loading personnel.
   15.9.3. Aircraft with jammed guns will use the primary Hot Gun arm/de-arm area (040
   Magnetic) or the alternate Hot Gun Line arm/de-arm area (220 Magnetic). Weapons loading
   crew chief will ensure all armament switches are Off, Safe or Normal and have the aircraft
   shut down.
   15.9.4. If weapons personnel cannot safe the munitions, weapons will safe all other stations,
   and the crew will shut down the aircraft and request EOD through CONFORM or the
   command post. The weapons/ EOD team chief evacuates all nonessential personnel. EOD
   safes the hung munitions. When safed, weapons/EOD informs the aircrew and releases the
   aircraft to the weapons load crew or contractor loading personnel
   15.9.5. When safed, taxi or tow the aircraft to the appropriate download area. Taxi or tow
   any aircraft containing internally loaded stores to the designated loading/unloading area with
   the weapons bay doors closed. F-22 and F-35 weapons bay doors may remain open.
   15.9.6. EOD and weapons loaders will remove hung flares at the primary arm/de-arm area
   (040 Magnetic) or the alternate arm/de-arm area (220 Magnetic). The weapons loading crew
   chief will ensure all armament switches are Off, Safe or Normal and have aircraft shut down.
15.10. Towing Aerial Targets.
   15.10.1. General. Air-to-air operations may be conducted at Point Mugu, Mojave B2 North
   Range or Nellis AFB, NV. When scheduled to use Pt Mugu or Nellis AFB, contact the MOC
   for prior coordination with the appropriate control agency to ensure operations are conducted
   under the local operating procedures for those particular ranges.
   15.10.2. Responsibilities. The tow aircraft commander is responsible for the safe conduct of
   the mission, and will:
 170                                                 EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013


       15.10.2.1. Make sure the range is clear before firing and while firing is in progress. The
       tow pilot may designate the firing aircraft/safety chase to do the range sweep.
       15.10.2.2. Ensure target reel-out or deployment is done over the gunnery range or over
       the PIRA.
       15.10.2.3. Avoid populated areas when carrying or towing targets to or from the range.
       Cross all major highways as nearly perpendicular as practical. Flights to Pt. Mugu may
       be made VFR for this purpose.
       15.10.2.4. Require a chase aircraft to remain with the tow aircraft until the target and all
       cable are jettisoned or dragged off or until the target is re-stowed. The firing aircraft may
       be used as chase.
   15.10.3. Aerial Gunnery Tow System (AGTS-36) Targets:
       15.10.3.1. Take off from either runway.
       15.10.3.2. Make a straight-in, normal landing configuration approach/landing if the
       target fails to deploy.
       15.10.3.3. Return deployed AGTS targets to Edwards if they are stable and structurally
       sound enough for the return trip.
       15.10.3.4. If the target and/or cable cannot be reeled in, jettison the cable and target over
       the using range. The alternate jettison area is PB-8 within the PIRA. Jettison at 3,500'
       MSL or higher, if necessary, due to cable length/target droop. Prior coordination with
       SPORT is required. If cable and/or target cannot be jettisoned, use Target Drag Off
       procedures (paragraph 15.11).
15.11. Target Drag Off and Landing (Fig 15.5.).
   15.11.1. Primary tow target drag off area is from the West side of Lakebed Rwy 17/35 to the
   West lakeshore. Coordinate with Tower prior to beginning the approach.
   15.11.2. A recommended technique for target drag off is to approach the drag off point at
   250 KIAS in a 5° to 10° dive. Level off by 200' AGL. The target will usually impact within
   1,000' of the level off point. Be aware several hundred feet of cable may remain attached to
   the tow aircraft after drag off.
   15.11.3. If landing with a deployed target or with trailing cable, the tow pilot will inform
   CONFORM. The following procedures will apply:
       15.11.3.1. Make a straight-in approach and land on a suitable Lakebed runway. After
       landing, hold position until maintenance removes remaining cable.
       15.11.3.2. If Lakebed runways are unusable make a straight-in landing on Rwy 22L.
       Tower will clear personnel and aircraft from within 1,000' of each side of the approach
       end. Remain at or above 4,300' MSL until passing the VORTAC. Make a steep approach
       and aim for touchdown on the paved overrun so that the target impacts on the Lakebed.

A3.3. Procedures.
   A3.3.1. Use numerical suffix assigned by the applicable organization. Formation flights
   may use the lead aircraft call sign or use the call sign of the individual aircraft.
   A3.3.2. All foreign national aircraft commanders flying in the R-2508 Complex will use a
   “90-series” call sign (e.g. Cobra 95). Foreign national pilots or other crewmembers that are
   flying with a US pilot-on-board need not use the 90-series call sign.
   A3.3.3. For units that use tail numbers as call signs, add the number nine (9) to the
   beginning of the numerical portion of the call sign.

     A4.1. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) Edwards Support Team
     recommends that the data in this instruction not be used. NGA is located at Edwards as a
     support to the Flight Test Squadron and the Western Test Range for all geospatial information.
     They maintain a database of these and many other points for the Western Test Range. The
     following is an example as to how this was made.
        A4.1.1. The date of data collection for the listed points is unknown and may differ by as
        much as a few hundred feet. The reason for this error is due to the time between data
        collection and/or the difference in the datum used. For example, some of the data in this
        AFTCI was collected prior to the advent of GPS and were positioned on the North American
        Datum 1927 (NAD27) rather than the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). Even if these
        points were transformed to the WGS the transformation parameters have their own set of
        problems.
        A4.1.2. GPS has helped us to know and understand more about the earth than ever before.
        With this knowledge came changes to the ellipsoid and geoid models. The most current
        ellipsoid model used today is the WGS84 (G1150). The most current geoid model accepted
        by the DoD is the Earth Gravity Model 1996 (EGM96). The EGM96 geoid is coincident
        with the WGS84 in that it is a global system. The heights provided from this model are
        known as orthometric heights which approximate MSL. If unsure of the quality of this data,
        recommend contacting the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency located at Edwards
        AFB, Commercial: (661) 277-5050.
     A4.2. Survey Coordinates (All Coordinates are WGS-84). NOTE: 412 TW/ENRE (73162)
     maintains Master survey file for points in and around Edwards AFB.

                       NIGHT/WEEKEND DECONFLICTION PLAN

A7.1. Maneuvering Airspace During Night/Weekend Flying. During night/weekend flying,
aircrews will coordinate a deconfliction plan with Wing Scheduling. In general, aircrews will
utilize the following profiles in order to maximize deconfliction.
   A7.1.1. Cords Road North – Airspace north of Cords Road (R2515), all altitudes unless
   further subdivided.
   A7.1.2. Cords Road South – Airspace south of Cords Road (R2515), all altitudes unless
   further subdivided.
   A7.1.3. R2524 – All airspace within R2524, all altitudes unless defined otherwise.
A7.2. Altitude and/or Lateral Separation. These profiles may be broken down further with
altitude and/or lateral separation or combined as necessary to meet mission requirements. If there
are limited users, these profiles may be expanded as long as a positive deconfliction plan has
been coordinated (i.e. two users: one in R2524 and one in all of R2515).
A7.3. Scheduling. Coordination with Wing Scheduling will be accomplished through the
standard scheduling process but NLT 1300 the day of the sortie. After this time, Wing
Scheduling will schedule the airspace based on airspace availability and the planned mission.
The profile will be annotated on the schedule. Deviations from published profiles must be
coordinated with all players either before flight or in-flight via R2508 Common Chat Freq.
A7.4. Coordination. Aircrews will contact Wing Scheduling at 7-6013 to confirm
night/weekend profiles.       SPORT (if open) and JOSHUA must also be briefed on
profile/deconfliction plans prior to step.

                         TACTICAL MANEUVERING AIRSPACE

A8.1. Tactical Maneuvering Areas. Test or training missions with greater than 1v1 limited or
unlimited maneuvering (ACM, Intercept, ACBT) will utilize airspace listed below. Test or
training missions with more than 4 aircraft will utilize the airspace listed below regardless of
maneuver category. Test or training missions with up to 4 aircraft are excluded from the
airspace requirements below if the target maneuvers are scripted or restricted (as defined by AFI
11-214).
   A8.1.1. “Skull Corner Area” over Panamint and Shoshone, (Fig A8.1. and Table A8.1.).
   A8.1.2. R2524.
   A8.1.3. R2505.
   A8.1.4. R2515 (if scheduled and other non-cooperative aircraft are not present).
   A8.1.5. Any airspace outside of the R2508 Complex which can provide exclusive use.
A8.2. Scheduling and Use.
   A8.2.1. All airspace must be scheduled and activated in order to provide exclusive use to the
   maximum extent possible. A “Knock it Off” IAW with the training rules (AFI 11-214) will
   be called if any non-cooperative aircraft are identified within the airspace.
   A8.2.2. OG/CC approval is required to deviate from these procedures.

A8.3. Skull Corner Operations. The lateral dimensions of Skull Corner are defined by the
following points. Skull Corner is composed of the eastern half of Panamint and the whole of
 202                                                 EDWARDSAFBI13-100 1 AUGUST 2013


Shoshone North, as shown in Figure 1 below. All other attributes, such as vertical dimensions,
chaff/flare use, etc. of Skull Corner are as defined in the parent airspace definitions.
   A8.3.1. Skull Corner will be scheduled for all ACBT missions desiring to use the airspace
   and “Skull Corner” will be annotated in the remarks. The Skull Corner scheduling template
   should include a Pancho 3 clearance, with the added airspace of Shoshone MOA and
   Shoshone North ATCAA from 200’ AGL to FL500.
   A8.3.2. To minimize impact to Los Angeles Center, Shoshone South ATCAA will not
   normally be scheduled. If intending to transit R2502 N/E to/from Skull Corner, units should
   obtain a PPR for R2502 N/E. Only one AFTC user will be scheduled for Skull Corner at any
   one time.
   A8.3.3. In accordance with the LOA governing Shoshone airspace, the airspace will not be
   given over to JOSHUA control until the ACBT flight requests activation. That activation
   request should be made with JOSHUA in EOR, or immediately airborne if contact is not
   possible in EOR. Expect a delay of up to 25 minutes for Los Angeles Center to clear the
   airspace of airline traffic and transfer control to JOSHUA.
   A8.3.4. The flight lead is responsible to maintain visibility on other possible users of Skull
   Corner and to coordinate use with the R-2508 CCF. This should be accomplished by calling
   DSN 527-2508 a minimum of one day prior to use to brief with the controller on the intended
   mission and obtain a report from the controller on other scheduled traffic. The flight lead
   should call back for traffic updates at step time. ACBT is approved in Skull Corner when any
   of the following conditions are met:
       A8.3.4.1. There is no other traffic in the airspace.
       A8.3.4.2. A deconfliction plan has been established with any traffic in the airspace. For
       example, if a flight of F-18s from China Lake is using the north portion of the airspace to
       do E-W runs into R-2505, the ACBT flight could deconflict to remain south of the F-18s
       desired flight path.
