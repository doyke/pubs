plain language in paragraph 1.2.; rewords and reorganizes remaining paragraphs for clarity; allows Infor-
mation Mapping as another format for written communication (see paragraph 4.9.); deletes Chapter 8 on
electronic mail (see AFI 33-119, Electronic Mail (E-Mail) Management and Use); moves Chapter 9,

                   ADMINISTRATIVE COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT

1.1. Formats Unique to the Air Staff. Air Staff formats differ from some of the other types of corre-
spondence prescribed in this manual. These formats are unique to the Air Staff and normally are used for
correspondence within the Air Staff, Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, Office of the Secretary of
Defense (OSD), and individuals or agencies within the Department of Defense (DoD) located in the
Washington DC area. Headquarters United States Air Force (HQ USAF) Headquarters Operating Instruc-
tion (HOI) 33-3, Correspondence Preparation, Control, and Suspense Tracking, outlines Air Staff
instructions for those forms of correspondence.

1.2. Plain Language. Prepare all Air Force correspondence using plain language. Plain language saves
the Air Force time, effort, and money. Plain language means using logical organization; common, every-
day words, except for necessary technical terms; "you" and other pronouns; the active voice; and short
sentences.
    1.2.1. Organize your material to help the reader. Identify your audience for the document, and write
    to get their attention and answer their questions. Consider any additional readers. Always start by put-
    ting your main message up front; when you bury the main message, you only make it harder on your
    readers. Present information in the succeeding paragraphs in a logical order.
    1.2.2. Avoid words and phrases that your readers might not understand. Define each abbreviation or
    acronym the first time you use it. Use the same term consistently to identify a specific thought or
    object. Use words in a way that does not conflict with ordinary or accepted usage. Avoid ambiguous
    phrasing, confusing legal terms, and technical jargon that can mislead your reader.
    1.2.3. Use "you" and other pronouns to speak directly to readers. Do not refer to people as if they
    were inanimate objects. Address the reader as “you.” “You” reinforces the message that the document
    is intended for your reader. Use “we” in place of your organization name. Be careful using “you” if it
    sounds accusatory or insulting. Instead, put the emphasis on the organization by using “we.”
    1.2.4. Active voice is the best way to identify who is responsible for what action. To communicate
    effectively, write the strong majority (around 75%) of your sentences in the active voice.
    1.2.5. Short sentences deliver a clear message. Your sentences should average 15 to 20 words--never
    make them longer than 40 words. Complex sentences loaded with dependent clauses and exceptions
    confuse the reader by losing the main point in a forest of words. Resist the temptation to put every-
    thing in one sentence. Break up your idea into its various parts and make each one the subject of its
    own sentence. Cut out words that aren't really necessary.
    1.2.6. Check http://www.plainlanguage.gov, for more plain language techniques.

1.3. Writers’ Responsibilities. Write correspondence in plain language--clear, concise, direct, and orga-
nized. Avoid duplication. Determine the proper form of reply to complete an action. Know your audience
and the purpose of your communication.
    1.3.1. Use this manual and Air Force Handbook (AFH) 33-337, The Tongue and Quill, when prepar-
    ing correspondence.
AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003                                                                    7


  1.3.2. Protect and mark any classified information in your correspondence according to DoD
  5200.1-R, Information Security Program, and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Manage-
  ment. Distribute on a need-to-know basis.
  1.3.3. Follow Air Force Supplement (AFSUP) to DoD 5400.7-R, DoD Freedom of Information Act
  Program, if you include For Official Use Only (FOUO) information, and refer to AFI 37-132, Air
  Force Privacy Act Program (will convert to AFI 33-332), if the Privacy Act applies.
  1.3.4. Check Joint Publication 1-02, Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated
  Terms, and Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 1-2, Air Force Glossary, for correct terms and
  usage.
  1.3.5. Use the Air Force address directory at http://afdir.hq.af.mil/ (see Chapter 9) for correct mail-
  ing addresses and standard office symbols (see Chapter 10).
  1.3.6. Distribute correspondence on a need-to-know basis.
  1.3.7. Conserve paper. Use backs of scrap paper for drafts and interoffice memos. Consider if you can
  communicate with other means such as a telephone call or E-mail. Do not print and mail out corre-
  spondence originally sent by E-mail, unless requested. Satisfy the minimum distribution requirements
  only.
  1.3.8. Use the telephone for routine matters. (You can record the inputs on your record copy of the
  final correspondence.)
  1.3.9. Unless critical, do not ask for negative replies or acknowledge receipt of negative replies.
  1.3.10. Call or use an AF Form 74, Communication Status Notice/Request, or an E-mail instead of
  a formal memorandum to check the status of an action (see paragraph 8.4.).
  1.3.11. Use caution when highlighting material you copy or microfilm, since highlighters can obscure
  the print.
  1.3.12. Select the appropriate distribution method. Some distribution methods include: E-mail, fac-
  simile (FAX), Automatic Digital Network (AUTODIN) message, Defense Message System (DMS),
  United States Postal Service (USPS), Base Information Transfer System (BITS), and Defense Courier
  Service (DCS). Consider the needs of the recipient when choosing the distribution method. Send com-
  puter-generated information electronically if the receiver will copy the information into another com-
  puter system.
  1.3.13. Use E-mail before using FAX, AUTODIN, BITS, or USPS. However, do not send classified
  E-mail on a system not authorized for that purpose. When transmitting classified E-mail take care to
  transmit only that level of classified information for which the system is certified and accredited.
  When transmitting sensitive unclassified information by E-mail, apply an appropriate level of safe-
  guards to ensure the sensitive, but unclassified, information is properly protected. For more informa-
  tion refer to AFI 33-119. When delegating an E-mail task, send a courtesy copy (cc) to the originator.
  1.3.14. Follow AFI 37-124, The Information Collections and Reports Management Program; Con-
  trolling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force Information Collections (will convert to AFI
  33-324), when requesting information licensed under Public Law 104-13.
  1.3.15. Avoid abbreviations and military jargon. Write out abbreviations the first time used and fol-
  low with the abbreviation in parenthesis.

    1.3.16. Apply record keeping requirements listed in AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule
    (will convert to AFMAN 33-322V4) when preparing official communications.

1.4. Suspense Actions:
    1.4.1. Set realistic time limits for answering priority and routine correspondence. Establish a sus-
    pense only when you need a reply by a specific date. Notify the action agency of the suspense date as
    early as possible.
    1.4.1. (62AW) In the absence of suspense dates, the following types of communications should be
    answered within these time frames listed:


 Congressional Inquiries                                                  24 hours
 Correspondence/Messages from General Officers                            72 hours
 Correspondence/Messages from Higher Headquarters                          5 days
 Communications from other AMC agencies                                  7 days
NOTE: The OPR will immediately notify the wing command section in the case of congressional,
Inspector General (IG) interests, distinguished visitor (DV) visits, and communications from general
officers.

    1.4.2. Control suspenses at all offices tasked with answering correspondence. Notify the originating
    agency before due date if the reply is delayed.
    1.4.3. You may use an automated system or an AF Form 388, Communication Control Record (see
    paragraph 8.5.), to control suspense actions.

1.5. Coordination Process:
    1.5.1. Coordinate with offices affected by the proposed action during the draft stage to keep from
    revising the final version.
    1.5.2. Coordinate by telephone or E-mail when possible. Indicate coordination at the bottom or in the
    right margin of the first page of correspondence. Do not indicate coordination in the upper right-hand
    corner since it is used for the file code (see AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records [will convert to
    AFMAN 33-322V2]).
    1.5.3. You may coordinate using AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet (see paragraph 8.6.),
    Optional Form (OF) 41, Routing and Transmittal Slip (see paragraph 8.2.), or on the first page of
    the correspondence.
    1.5.4. Remember to coordinate with each office that has a functional interest. Consider the chain of
    command to ensure complete coordination. Schedule enough time to finish review and coordination.
1.6. (Added-62AW) Authentication. Wing and group staff agencies are authorized to authenticate corre-
spondence pertinent in their area of responsibility. Authentication must be accomplished by the staff
agency chief or designated representative. Correspondence which may have a potential major impact on
the wing or group because of policy or procedural implications are listed below. This list is not all inclu-
sive and when doubt exists, refer the correspondence for a signature of the appropriate commander. Cor-
AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003                                                                9


respondence referred to the commander for signature will be written in the first person. A command
signature element is required for correspondence addressed to:
   1.6.1. (Added-62AW) A general or flag officer on any subject.
   1.6.2. (Added-62AW) An AMC staff agency chief. Routine replies to requests for information do not
   require a command signature element: Record copy will show coordination by 62 AW/CC or the 62
   MSG/CC in accordance with this instruction.
   1.6.3. (Added-62AW) HQ 15 AF command section.
   1.6.4. (Added-62AW) A reply to inspection from higher headquarters.
   1.6.5. (Added-62AW) A response to a special directive or HQ AMC Special Interest Items. Except
   for routine responses to requests for information, or when directed to do otherwise, correspondence
   intended for HQ USAF or HQ AMC staff agencies will be addressed to the appropriate 15 AF staff
   agency for subsequent referral to higher headquarters. An information copy of correspondence to 15
   AF will not be forwarded to HQ USAF or HQ AMC unless directed to do so by HQ USAF or HQ
   AMC, or when it has been approved by the 62d Airlift Wing Commander or Vice Commander, 62d
   Maintenance Group (62 MXG), 62d Medical Group (62 MDG), 62d Operations Group (62 OG), or
   62d Mission Support Group (62 MSG) Commander or their designated alternates.

                                                  Chapter 2

                                STATIONERY STANDARDS AND USES

2.1. Paper Standards. Use 8 1/2- by 11-inch paper.
     2.1.1. Original. Use white letterhead stationery (printed or computer-generated) for the first page of a
     memorandum, staff study, report, or minutes of a meeting. Use plain white paper for continuation
     pages. (See paragraph 2.4. for computer-generated letterhead.)
     2.1.2. Copies. Use plain white paper for information or convenience copies.
     2.1.3. Paper Quality. Stationery is produced from recycled paper that has at least 25 percent cotton or
     rag content. The recycled logo is shown in the watermark. Paper quality must not exceed the follow-
     ing:


       Item             Paper Color         Grade         Pounds
     Letterhead            White           50% rag          16
                                             or
                                           25% rag           20


  Continuation             White           50% rag          16
                                             or
                                           25% rag          20


     Manifold              White           25% rag            9

2.2. Standard Letterhead. DoD Instruction 5330.2, Specifications for DoD Letterheads, establishes the
standards for letterheads. There are two types of letterhead: printed and computer-generated. Use only the
letterhead formats discussed in paragraphs 2.3. and 2.4. Submit any exceptions to the specified standards
through major commands (MAJCOM) to the Air Force Communications and Information Center, Combat
Support Division (HQ AFCIC/ITS). Air National Guard (ANG) exceptions will be approved by individ-
ual ANG State Headquarters or the Director, Air National Guard.

2.3. Printed Letterhead. See Figure 2.1. for an example of letterhead. MAJCOMs may elect to use
generic two-line command letterhead for command-wide use. MAJCOMs may authorize letterhead below
wing level if the quantity needed justifies the printing cost or other circumstances warrant. Any unit with-
out its own letterhead uses its parent unit's letterhead stationery and identifies its organization and stan-
dard office symbol in the FROM caption.
     2.3.1. Ink. Print the letterhead and seal using either reflex blue or black ink
     2.3.2. Seal. The DoD seal is one inch in diameter. Align the seal 1/2-inch from the upper left and top
     edge of the paper. Do not use any other emblem, decorative device, or distinguishing insignia with or
     in place of the DoD seal.
     2.3.3. Format. Center organization name and address on the letterhead using no more than four lines:
AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003                                                                        11


       2.3.3.1. First Line. DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE. Center this line leaving 5/8-inch from
       the top of the sheet. Print it in 12 point uppercase using copperplate letters, heavy plate Gothic let-
       ters, or equivalent.
       2.3.3.2. Second Line. Center the name of the organization as shown in the G-series special order
       that established it. If G-series orders do not exist, the MAJCOM Director of Communications and
       Information decides the second line. Put HEADQUARTERS before the organization's name only
       if it appears in the activation order. Print it in 10.5 point uppercase using copperplate letters, heavy
       plate Gothic letters, or equivalent. If the name is more than fifty characters, you may use an addi-
       tional line.
       2.3.3.3. Third Line. If used, center the location without the ZIP+4 code on this line. Print it in 10.5
       point uppercase using copperplate letters, heavy plate Gothic letters, or equivalent. The bottom of
       the third line should be 1 1/16 inches from the top of the sheet. If your unit is overseas, do not
       show the Army and Air Force Post Office (APO) or Fleet Post Office (FPO) number and a geo-
       graphical location together. You may use the two-letter state abbreviation or spell out the state
       name. Do not use punctuation in the last line of the address element.
       EXAMPLES:


                          DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
                HEADQUARTERS AIR EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMMAND


                                DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
                           AIR EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMMAND

                          DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE
                HEADQUARTERS AIR EDUCATION AND TRAINING COMMAND
                         RANDOLPH AIR FORCE BASE TEXAS

   2.3.4. Optional Items. Fold marks are guides for judging typing space and for folding the paper in
   three equal parts. Typist guidelines show you are near the 1-inch bottom margin. If used, print them in
   half-point rules (see Figure 2.1.).

2.4. Computer-Generated Letterhead. Computer-generated letterhead allows for the use of continu-
ous form paper and high production rates. It also permits an organization to generate its own letterhead
stationery. Use correspondence quality print. (Letter quality dot-matrix print is acceptable).
   2.4.1. Use. You may use computer-generated letterhead the same as printed letterhead when the
   design satisfies all specifications in paragraph 2.3. Use computer-generated letterhead only for corre-
   spondence within the DoD. Do not use for the signature of the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of
   Defense, or Executive Secretary of the DoD. MAJCOMs may direct the use of printed letterhead for
   headquarters and subordinate units.
   2.4.2. Format. When using computer-generated letterhead, you may identify the office name as
   approved in organizational designation documents. Center the office name below the organization
12                                                   AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003


     name. You may identify the complete mailing address including ZIP+4 code. Do not use more than
     four lines for the letterhead.

2.5. HQ USAF Letterhead. HQ USAF offices use this stationery, as do certain field operating agencies
(FOA) when their commanders function as members of Air Staff.

2.6. DoD Programs and Activities Letterhead. When the Department of the Air Force is the executive
agent for DoD-directed programs, the letterhead format is similar to paragraph 2.3.; do not show
DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE on the top line for DoD programs or joint activities. Use this lay-
out instead:
     2.6.1. First line. Print the name of the program as shown in the DoD directive.
     2.6.2. Second and third line. Print the location. For further guidance, contact HQ AFCIC/ITS.
     EXAMPLES:


                           DoD MEDICAL EVALUATION REVIEW BOARD
                                      USAF ACADEMY
                                   COLORADO SPRINGS CO


                         ARMED FORCES VOCATIONAL TESTING GROUP
                                456 ARMY DRIVE, ROOM 407
                          RANDOLPH AIR FORCE BASE TX 78150-4567

2.7. Slogans. MAJCOMs and FOAs may permit use of slogans on official memorandums and personal-
ized letters. Slogans will:
     2.7.1. Represent the mission of the organization.
     2.7.2. Be easy to understand.
     2.7.3. Not be offensive.
     2.7.4. Meet printing specifications (printed approximately 1/2-inch from bottom of page).

2.8. Logograms (Logos). Do not use the Department of the Air Force seal on stationery; the proper use
of the Department of the Air Force seal is covered in Attachment 2. DoD Instruction 5330.2 prohibits use
of logos, emblems, decorative devices, or distinguishing insignia on stationery. OSD grants waivers only
for programs of Air Force-wide importance and applicability, such as the Air Force Fiftieth Anniversary.
Send waiver requests to HQ AFCIC/ITS for staffing with Defense Administrative Service (DAS). Use
existing logo stationery until all supplies are exhausted.

                                                  Chapter 3

                                   THE OFFICIAL MEMORANDUM

3.1. General Rules:
     3.1.1. Memorandums are used to communicate with all DoD agencies to include Joint Chiefs of Staff,
     unified and specified commands, and other Federal agencies. They are also used to conduct official
     business outside the Government with vendors or contractors when the personalized letter is inappro-
     priate.
     3.1.2. Use printed letterhead, computer-generated letterhead, or plain bond paper. The writer decides
     which stationery is appropriate. Chapter 2 contains formats for stationery.
     3.1.3. Type or print only on one side of the paper using black or blue-black ink.
     3.1.4. You may use dot matrix printers for official correspondence if the print is correspondence qual-
     ity.
     3.1.5. Use 10 to 12 point fonts for text.
     3.1.6. Correct all typographical errors on all correspondence, but do not redo routine correspondence
     to correct minor errors that do not change the writer's intent. Correct these errors neatly and legibly in
     ink. Redo correspondence only when the correction is important enough to justify the time, purpose,
     and expense.
     3.1.7. See DoD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401 for the necessary markings on classified correspondence.
     3.1.8. See Figure 3.1. for an example of an official memorandum.

3.2. Margins. Use 1-inch margins on the left, right, and bottom for most memorandums.
For shorter communications, you may adjust the margins. Use these guidelines:


When memorandum text is:                   Use:
20 lines or more                           1-inch margins
10-19 lines                                1 to 1 1/2-inch margins
1-9 lines                                  1 1/2 to 2-inch margins

3.3. Heading Format:
     3.3.1. Date Element. Type or stamp the date flush with the right margin, 1.75 inches or 10 line spaces
     from the top of the page. Use the format of day, month, and year, for example, 6 June 1999. Unless the
     date of signature has legal significance, date the original and all copies of the correspondence at the
     time of dispatch.
     3.3.2. MEMORANDUM FOR Element. Type “MEMORANDUM FOR” in uppercase, flush with the
     left margin, 2.5 inches or 14 line spaces from the top of the page. After the MEMORANDUM FOR
     element, type two spaces followed by the recipient organization. For short communications, you may
     adjust the top margin in order to center the memorandum.
AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003                                                                    15


     3.3.2.1. When addressing one office, type in uppercase the organization name or the organization
     abbreviation and office symbol separated by a virgule (/). You may type a name in parentheses
     after the organization and omit the “ATTENTION” element.
     3.3.2.2. When sending the same memorandum to several offices, prepare a multiple-address
     memorandum. Align subsequent addresses with the first address. Circle, underline, or highlight
     the recipient organization for each copy. Stay consistent; use the same format throughout.
     EXAMPLES:


MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF
DIRECTOR, COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION
GENERAL COUNSEL
Or
                                   MEMORANDUM FOR AF/CC
                                        HQ USAF/SC
                                          SAF/GC

     3.3.2.3. When frequently sending correspondence to the same group of addresses, use a categori-
     cal address. See Attachment 3 for information on categorical addresses.
     3.3.2.4. When the address list is too long to include in the heading, use a distribution list. Type
     “MEMORANDUM FOR SEE DISTRIBUTION.” Include the addresses in the DISTRIBUTION
     element or on a separate page attached to the memorandum (see paragraph 3.5.5.). NOTE: Orga-
     nizations may establish distribution codes and lists to satisfy internal distribution requirements. To
     establish distribution codes, the organization must provide the distribution list to the Base Infor-
     mation Transfer Center (BITC) and keep the list current.
  3.3.3. ATTENTION Element. If the ATTENTION element is used, type “ATTENTION:” or
  “ATTN:” or “THROUGH:,” followed by the name, in uppercase, one line below the MEMORAN-
  DUM FOR line. Align under the address.
  EXAMPLE:


MEMORANDUM FOR SAF/AAX
              ATTENTION: COL JONES

  3.3.4. FROM Element. Type “FROM:” in uppercase, flush with the left margin, two line spaces
  below the last line of the MEMORANDUM FOR element (and the ATTENTION element, if used).
  After the FROM element, type two spaces followed by the organization abbreviation and office sym-
  bol of the originator. The FROM element contains the full mailing address of the originator so that
  recipients may easily prepare and address return correspondence.
     3.3.4.1. The first line of the FROM element includes the organization abbreviation and office
     symbol separated by a virgule and typed in uppercase. If the complete mailing address is printed
     on the letterhead (see paragraph 2.4.2.) or if all recipients for the memorandum are located on the
     same installation as the originator, omit the second and third lines of the FROM element.

        3.3.4.2. The second line of the FROM element is the delivery address of the originator.
        3.3.4.3. The third line of the FROM element includes the city, state, and ZIP+4 code.
        3.3.4.4. Place contact names, E-mail addresses, fax numbers, and telephone numbers in the last
        paragraph of the memorandum text.
     3.3.5. SUBJECT Element. Type “SUBJECT:” in uppercase, flush with the left margin, two line
     spaces below the last line of the FROM element. After the SUBJECT element, type two spaces fol-
     lowed by the subject title; capitalize the first letter of each word except articles, prepositions, and con-
     junctions. Be brief and clear. If you need a second line, align it under the first word of the title.
        3.3.5.1. When writing about a single person who is not the addressee, include rank and full name
        in the subject line. If you refer to the person again in the text of the memorandum, use only the
        rank and surname. Do not include names in the subject line when writing about two or more indi-
        viduals. When writing about several people, state their full names with rank in the text of the
        memorandum the first time the names appear.

SUBJECT: Appointment of OJT Monitor (S/S Our Memo, 23 Jun 94)

     3.3.6. References Element. To cite two or more references, use the References element. Type “Refer-
     ences:” two line spaces below the last line of the SUBJECT element. Capitalize the first letter of every
     word except articles, prepositions, and conjunctions.
        3.3.6.1. Identify each reference by organization of origin, type of communication, date, and sub-
        ject. When referencing a commercial publication, state the author's name, publisher, publication

      3.3.6.3. Attach a copy of the reference, or instructions to obtain it, if the reader does not have it.
      Type “(NOTAL)” after the citation if not all addressees received the referenced item.

3.4. Text of a Memorandum:
   3.4.1. Spacing. The first line of the text begins two line spaces below the last line of the SUBJECT
   element (and the References element, if used). Single-space the text, but double-space between para-
   graphs and subparagraphs. You may double-space the text of a one-paragraph memorandum less than
   eight lines.
18                                                     AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003


     3.4.2. Paragraphs. Number and letter each paragraph and subparagraph (unless under the jurisdiction
     of HQ USAF HOI 33-3 which requires indented paragraphs without numbers). A single paragraph is
     not numbered. Indent subparagraphs 0.5-inch or five spaces and number or letter them in sequence.
     Use the following format to subparagraph short sentences or phrases of a half line or less:
     EXAMPLE:


 This format has several advantages: (a) It's compact, (b) it highlights ideas, and (c) it saves space.

     3.4.3. Punctuation. Use conventional rules of English grammar. See AFH 33-337 for specific applica-
     tions.
     3.4.4. Word Division. When dividing a word, separate between syllables (see AFH 33-337).
     3.4.5. Quotations. When quoting numbered paragraphs from another document, cite the source and
     paragraph numbers in your text. See AFH 33-337 for specific applications.
     3.4.6. Suspense Dates. If you include a suspense date in the text of the memorandum, emphasize it by
     placing it in a separate paragraph.
     3.4.7. Identifying Point of Contact. Indicate contact names, telephone numbers, and E-mail addresses
     in the text of the correspondence, normally in the last paragraph.
     3.4.8. Continuation Pages. Use plain bond paper. Begin typing the text of the continuation page four
     lines below the page number. Type at least two lines of the text on each page. Avoid dividing a para-
     graph of less than four lines between two pages.
     3.4.9. Page Numbering. The first page of a memorandum is never numbered. You may omit page
     numbers on a one or two-page memorandum; however memorandums longer than two pages must
     have page numbers. Number the succeeding pages starting with page 2. Place page numbers 0.5-inch
     or four line spaces from the top of the page, flush with the right margin. Number the continuation
     pages of each attachment as a separate sequence.

3.5. Closing Format:
     3.5.1. Authority Line Element. The authority line informs readers that the person who signed the doc-
     ument acted for the commander, the command section, or the headquarters. If it is used, type in upper-
     case, two line-spaces below the last line of the text and flush with the signature element. Use the
     words "FOR THE COMMANDER" unless the head of the organization has another title like com-
     mander in chief, superintendent, or commandant.
        3.5.1.1. Use the authority line when:
            3.5.1.1.1. A commander's designated representative signs for a specific action.
            3.5.1.1.2. A document represents the commander's position or the coordinated position of the
            headquarters staff.
            3.5.1.1.3. Staff members sign documents that direct action or announce policy within their
            areas of responsibility.
        3.5.1.2. Do not use the authority line when:
AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003                                                                      19


         3.5.1.2.1. The commander (or head of the organization) signs.
         3.5.1.2.2. The deputy or vice commander signs when the commander is temporarily away
         from the place of duty (TDY, etc.) unless command action is directed by law and requires an
         indication of delegation.
         3.5.1.2.3. The correspondence expresses opinions of units, directorates, divisions, offices, or
         branches.
         3.5.1.2.4. The correspondence is addressed outside the DoD.
  3.5.2. Signature Element. Type or stamp the signature element five lines below the last line of text
  and 4.5 inches from the left edge of the page or three spaces to the right of page center. If the authority
  line is used, type the signature element five lines below the authority line. If dual signatures are
  required, type the junior ranking official’s signature block at the left margin; type the senior ranking
  official’s signature block 4.5 inches from the left edge of the page or three spaces to the right of page
  center. The signature element may be added after you are sure who will sign the correspondence. Do
  not place the signature element on a continuation page by itself. Consider correspondence received via
  E-mail, copied, or stamped SIGNED as authoritative as long as the signed copy is kept on file at the
  originating office.
     3.5.2.1. First Line. Type the name in uppercase the way the person signs it. Include grade and ser-
     vice if military; civilians may include their grade. Avoid using legal, educational, or ecclesiastical
     degrees or titles.
     3.5.2.2. Second Line. Type the duty title. Use the term "Acting" before the duty title of a staff
     position if the incumbent is absent or the position is vacant. Do not sign "for" or "in the absence
     of." Do not use the term "Acting" for any command capacity or where prohibited by law or statute
     (see AFI 37-121, Authentication of Air Force Records [will convert to AFI 33-321] and AFI
     51-604, Appointment to and Assumption of Command).
     3.5.2.3. Third Line. Type name of the office or organization level if not printed on the letterhead
     or included in the heading. Limit the signature element to three lines if possible; however, if a line
     of the signature element is too long, indent two spaces on the next line.

  3.5.3. Attachment Element. Type “Attachment:” or “Attachments:” at the left margin, three line
  spaces below the signature element (see Figure 3.1.). Do not number a single attachment; when there
  are two or more attachments, list each by number and in the order mentioned in the memorandum.
  Describe each attachment briefly, but do not use general terms or abbreviations such as "as stated," "as
  described above," or "a/s." Cite the office of origin, the type of communication, the date, and the num-
  ber of copies (in parentheses) if more than one. Include the subject of the attachment if the receiver
  will not get copies of attachments or if subject is not already referenced in text. For classified attach-
  ments, show the assigned classification symbol (in parentheses).
  EXAMPLE:


Attachments:
1. HQ USAF/SC Memo, 2 May 98 (U)(2)
2. 380 FMS/CC Msg, 232300Z May 98 (NOTAL)
3. HQ USAF/SP Memo, 3 May 98 (S)

      3.5.3.1. Type “(sep cover)” when sending an attachment separately. Send a copy of the memoran-
      dum when you send the attachment.
EXAMPLE:


Attachments:
1. AFI XX-XX, 26 May 94
2. AFI XX-XX, 24 May 94 (sep cover)

      3.5.3.2. Do not divide attachment listings between two pages. If the listing is too long, type
      “Attachments: (listed on next page),” and list the attachments on a separate page.
  3.5.4. Courtesy Copy Element. When sending courtesy copies to activities other than to addressee,
  type "cc:" flush with the left margin, two line spaces below the attachment element. If the attachment
  element is not used, begin typing three line spaces below the signature element. List names or organi-
  zation abbreviation and office symbol of offices to receive copies. If a courtesy copy is sent without
  including the attachments, type “wo Atch” after the office. Circle, underline, or highlight the office to
  indicate the recipient.
  EXAMPLE:


cc:
HQ AETC/DP wo Atch
HQ USAFE/DP Atch 2 only
HQ PACAF/DP (Atch under sep cover)

      3.5.4.1. If courtesy copies of a memorandum are not signed, write or stamp "signed" with black or
      dark blue ink above the signature block.
      3.5.4.2. Do not show internal distribution of courtesy copies on the original (or courtesy copy) for
      correspondence addressed outside your activity. However, you may show the distribution if one
22                                                    AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003


        addressee needs to know who received a courtesy copy, or if correspondence is multiple-addressed
        and reproduced.
        3.5.4.3. When using manifold tissue courtesy copies, type or stamp your unit's designation at the
        top of the first page.
     3.5.5. DISTRIBUTION Element. When SEE DISTRIBUTION is used for the MEMORANDUM
     FOR element (see paragraph 3.3.2.5.), type “DISTRIBUTION:” flush with the left margin, two line
     spaces below the attachment element or the courtesy copy element if used. If both the attachment ele-
     ment and the courtesy copy element are not used, begin typing three line spaces below the signature
     element. Do not divide distribution lists between two pages. If the listing is too long, type “DISTRI-
     BUTION: (listed on next page),” and list the organizations on a separate page.
     3.5.6. Optional Automated File Designator (AFD) Element. The AFD element documents the storage
     location for data stored on disks or other magnetic media. Type the AFD two line spaces below the
     courtesy copy distribution element. You may include the AFD in the identification line of talking,
     position, and bullet background papers.
        3.5.6.1. Contents of the AFD are based on the user's needs and the system being used; e.g., the
        element may include items such as the file name, typist's initials, and number or title of the disk.
        3.5.6.2. Refer to World Wide Web pages by typing the uniform resource locator (URL) as the
        AFD.

3.6. Typeset Correspondence. You may typeset correspondence for a large audience (such as a memo-
randum to ALMAJCOM-FOA). Use an appropriate letterhead as with other official correspondence. You
can use the full range of typesetting capabilities, including, but not limited to, two columns, italics, bold
type, variable spacing, boxed inserts, and screened backgrounds.

3.7. Record or Coordination Copy. This is the official record for your office files, so make sure it is
completely legible. Type or write additional information of value only to the office of record on the record
or coordination copy.
     3.7.1. Showing Coordination. Type or write the organization abbreviation and office symbol of each
     office that should coordinate across the bottom or right side of the record copy. The coordinating offi-
     cials enter their last name and date.
     3.7.2. Showing Internal Courtesy Copy Distribution. List all internal courtesy distribution on the
     record copy unless it is listed on the original.
     3.7.3. Identifying the Writer. If identifying the writer is of value to the office of record, place the
     writer's organization abbreviation and office symbol, name, telephone number, typist's initials, the
     date the correspondence is typed, and, if desired, the document name/number at the top or bottom
     margin of the page. Do not repeat the writer's name if the writer signed the correspondence. Use a new
     identification line, if desired, each time the correspondence is rewritten or retyped. Place the name of
     the person who rewrote it on the next line followed by the date it was retyped.
     3.7.4. Annotating for Magnetic Storage Media. Use the writer identification line (see paragraph
     3.7.3.) to show document name, storage location, or file identification for reference and possible revi-
     sion or reprinting.
AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003                                                                      23


   3.7.5. Preparing a Memorandum for Record (MR). When preparing a MR for another office or when
   using it as your primary record, write or type on the record copy any information needed for the
   record. Continue on the back or a separate sheet if you need more space. The writer signs (see AFH
   33-337).

3.8. Attachments to Correspondence. Attachment, appendix, annex, and exhibit all mean additional or
supplementary material and indicate relative position within a correspondence package. The first addition
is an attachment; an addition to an attachment is an appendix; an addition to an appendix is an annex; and
so on. Indicate on the attachment, appendix, or annex if there are appendices, annexes, or exhibits to it.
Type or write attachment markings in the same position as on the basic correspondence. If possible, use
pencil to allow future renumbering and reuse with other documents. Mark attachments as follows:
   3.8.1. Mark each attachment in the lower right corner as Atch 1, Atch 2, Atch 3, etc.
   3.8.2. Mark additions to an attachment as Appendix A, Appendix B, Appendix C, etc.
   3.8.3. Mark additions to appendices as Annex 1, Annex 2, Annex 3, etc.
   3.8.4. Mark additions to an annex as Exhibit A, Exhibit B, Exhibit C, etc.
   3.8.5. For multiple page attachments, number the pages of each attachment in a separate sequence.
   For example Atch 1 (1 of 3), Atch 1 (2 of 3), Atch 1 (3 of 3), etc.
   3.8.6. When sending more than one copy of an attachment, place the copy number (typed or hand-
   written) to the right and slightly above the attachment number to indicate the copy is the first, second,
   third, etc. For example Atch 11, Atch 12, Atch 13, etc.

3.9. Arranging Correspondence. See Figure 3.2. for the order to arrange correspondence for signature.
When using tabs, position the first tab at the lower right corner. Position the next tab slightly higher (see
Figure 3.3.). Staple a memorandum of more than one page, or with attachments, in the upper left corner.
If possible, arrange pages so that the reader can read information without removing the staples or paper
clips; for example, turn landscape pages with top to the left. If required, prepare envelopes or facsimile
cover sheets, and place them at the left side behind the copies for dispatch. Use a paper clip to hold the
packet together before dispatch. Organizations may specify alternate methods to suit their needs.

                       OTHER TYPES OF WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS

4.1. Personalized Letter. Use a personalized letter when your communication needs a personal touch or
when warmth or sincerity is essential. You may use it to write to an individual on a private matter for
praise, condolence, sponsorship, etc. Keep it brief, preferably no longer than one page. Always use autho-
rized USPS abbreviations (see USPS Publication 28, Postal Addressing Standards) for addresses. Avoid
using acronyms. See Figure 4.1. for an example of a personalized letter.

       4.1.1.1. Date Element. Type the date flush with the right margin, 1.75 inches or 10 line spaces
       from the top of the page. For short communications, you may adjust the top margin to center the
       letter on the page. Use the format of day, month, year, e.g., 6 June 1999.
       4.1.1.2. Return Address Element. Begin typing the return address flush with the left margin, 2.5
       inches or 14 line spaces from the top of the page (or 4 line spaces below the date). Include name,

       is used with military rank abbreviations.
       4.1.1.4. Salutation Element. Begin the salutation two line spaces under the receiver’s address.
       Type “Dear” followed by the title and last name of the receiver.
   4.1.2. Text of a Letter. Start the text of a letter two line spaces below the salutation element. Do NOT
   number paragraphs. Indent all major paragraphs 0.5 inch or five spaces; indent subparagraphs an addi-
   tional 0.5 inch or five spaces. You may double-space text of a one-paragraph letter with less than eight
   lines. Type references in the first paragraph.

       two line spaces below the attachment element. If the attachment element is not used, type “cc:”
       three line spaces after the signature element.

4.2. "IN TURN" Memorandum. Use an "IN TURN" memorandum to distribute the official memoran-
dum to several individuals or offices in sequence.

     4.2.1. Originators. Prepare an "IN TURN" memorandum when the information is too long to type on
     an Optional Form (OF) 41 or when the final addressee or office of primary responsibility (OPR) must
     see the coordination or action of all addressees. Use the official memorandum format (see Chapter 3).
     Type “IN TURN” in uppercase, one line below the last address of the MEMORANDUM FOR ele-
     ment. Align with addresses.
     EXAMPLE:


MEMORANDUM FOR HQ USAF/SC
               HQ AFCIC/IT
               HQ AFCIC/XP
               HQ AFCIC/SY
               IN TURN

     4.2.2. Recipients. When you receive an "IN TURN" memorandum, strike through your organization
     abbreviation and office symbol, sign or initial, and date. Write "Concur,” “Nonconcur," "Comments
     attached," or "Comments sent by separate correspondence to" next to the date. Prepare an OF 41 or a
     separate memorandum for a lengthy comment. Attach comments to the "IN TURN" memorandum if
     the remaining addressees need them; otherwise, send comments directly to the final addressee. Send
     the "IN TURN" memorandum to the next address.

4.3. North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Letter. See NATO Standardization Agreement
(STANAG) 2066 (Edition No. 5), Layout for Military Correspondence, for proper format. Write to Naval
Publications and Forms Center, 5801 Tabor Avenue, Philadelphia PA 19120-5002 to get a copy. When
using the NATO format, always include the name and telephone number of a point of contact. Use the
term "enclosures" instead of "attachments." Enclosures may have appendices and annexes. List all refer-
ences in the heading or in the beginning of the correspondence text.

4.4. Short-Note Reply. If you have enough space, write or type your comments on the incoming corre-
spondence (see AFH 33-337).

4.5. Memorandum for Record (MR). Use the MR to document a discussion or an oral agreement. Pre-
pare a MR using the official memorandum format (see Chapter 3). Type RECORD after the MEMO-
RANDUM FOR element (see AFH 33-337).

4.6. Meeting Minutes. Prepare meeting minutes using the official memorandum format (see Chapter
3). Minutes are a clear summary of the participants' comments. They document planned or completed
action. Date the minutes the day they are distributed. To save space, use two columns to list names of
members present. Place information regarding a future meeting in the last paragraph. When a person signs
a paper as a member of a board or committee, the signature element indicates that person's status on that
board or committee, not any other position the person may hold. Type "Approved as written" two line
spaces below the recorder's signature block, followed by the approving authority's signature block.

4.7. Staff Study Report. This is a problem-solution report (see AFH 33-337).

4.8. Talking, Bullet Background, and Position Papers. (See AFH 33-337.)
AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003                                                                      29


   4.8.1. Talking papers (also called point papers) are concise, factual, written outlines for oral presenta-
   tions, memory ticklers, or quick reference outlines. They use fragments to present key points, posi-
   tions, and facts in a brief, orderly fashion when the user has knowledge of the subject.
   4.8.2. Background papers are multipurpose written briefs used to provide information, forward items
   of interest, or to summarize current or potential problems. They include an introductory paragraph, a
   basic discussion, and a conclusion.
   4.8.3. Position papers are used to advocate or to convince the reader on an argument or position.

4.9. Information Mapping. You may use the information mapping method for staff study reports and for
talking, bullet background, and position papers. The Information Mapping methodology helps writers
analyze, organize, and present information in a concise, user-friendly manner. Information Mapping prin-
ciples can improve a wide variety of communications. For more information, contact HQ AFCIC/ITS.

4.10. Indorsement Memorandums. Indorsements are used at the discretion of sender as space allows
(see AFH 33-337).

   4.11.3. (Added-62AW) All categorically addressed correspondence may be addressed as either CAT
   II or CAT VI instead of using the full address. A survey on the distribution of CAT letters will be con-
   ducted as needed. Emphasis will be on the minimum number of copies required to accomplish the
   mission. CAT addresses will not be used for distribution of classified correspondence. Distribution of
   CAT addressed communications will be made by the Base Information Transfer Center (BITC). Indi-
   cate in the Remarks section of the Defense Automated Printing Service print request form “deliver to
   62 CS/SCSA.” For special distribution, the following examples are provided for guidance:

                                                Chapter 5

                               GUIDE AND FORM MEMORANDUMS

5.1. Guide Memorandums. These are models of a memorandum text composed in advance, but not
printed. They may be complete memorandums with several paragraphs or single paragraphs. Use guide
memorandums to compose official memorandums. Select the combination of paragraphs appropriate for
the reply.

5.2. Form Memorandums. These are mass-produced memorandums sent in place of individually com-
posed or typed memorandums when many individuals require similar information or the same individual
requires the information at frequent intervals. These also include standard formats stored on electronic
media that can be accessed, completed with optional data, and then printed or electronically forwarded.
     5.2.1. Types of Form Memorandums. The three basic formats for form memorandums are prewritten,
     fill-in, and optional statement. Prewritten form memorandums omit the receiver’s name and address
     and the date. Fill-in form memorandums omit any information that varies with each response.
     Optional statement form memorandums provide several options; the writer checks the statements that
     apply to the specific situation. A form memorandum may have space for filling in information, select-
     ing one of several statements, or both.
     5.2.2. Form Memorandums Use. Use form memorandums when the subject matter and the action are
     routine or informational, when it is more economical to duplicate the memorandum than to type each
     memorandum individually, and when the printed format expedites response from the recipient. Do not
     use form memorandums if the subject is of a personal or congratulatory nature, if it may bring grief,
     disappointment, or embarrassment to the recipient, or if a numbered form would be better.
     5.2.3. Preparing and Controlling Form Memorandums:
        5.2.3.1. Justification. Analyze your correspondence for a 2-week period and group memoran-
        dums that are similar in meaning and purpose. Count the number of individually typed memoran-
        dums for each group. A form memorandum is justified if:


     The line count (text) of a repetitive          And the number of similar
              memorandum is:                    memorandums written each month is:


                       5                                       30 or more
                      10                                       15 or more
                      15                                       10 or more

NOTE: Check with your forms manager to determine if a numbered form would be more beneficial.
        5.2.3.2. Composition. Follow the principles of writing in AFH 33-337. Consider the memoran-
        dum's impact, especially if it is sent outside the Air Force. If a memorandum collects information,
        review the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act and AFI 37-124 (will convert to AFI
        33-324).
AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003                                                              33


     5.2.3.3. Design. Leave enough blank space to complete a fill-in form memorandum. Align check
     boxes (ο) on an optional statement form memorandum.
     5.2.3.4. Signature. Sign form memorandums individually or sign the master before reproduction.
     5.2.3.5. Control. Identify each form or guide memorandum by a different symbol if you have
     more than one, e.g., FM-1, FM-2, etc.; GM-1, GM-2, etc. You may mark the memorandums them-
     selves or their folders. Review the need and currency of the memorandum before reproduction,
     and reproduce no more than a 3-month supply.
     5.2.3.5. (62AW) All requests for reproduction and new Form Memorandums (FM)/Guide Memo-
     randums (GM) will be approved by the squadron Form Memorandum Monitor or the unit com-
     mander. The Defense Automated Printing Service printing request form will be addressed to
     Defense Automated Printing Service (DAPS) and will be signed using the duty title “Unit Form
     Memorandum Monitor” unless signed by the commander. Enter the approximate monthly usage in
     the remarks section. Enter the total amount needed which will not exceed a 3-month supply unless
     approved by the Chief, Administrative Communications (62 CS/SCSA).
     5.2.3.6. (Added-62AW) Each FM or GM will be numbered if the office uses more than one form
     memorandum. The number will include the complete functional address symbol, FM or GM and
     number (Example: 62 CS/SCSA FM-1 or 62 CS/SCSA GM-1). The form/guide memorandum
     number is placed in the lower left corner and approximately one inch from the bottom, or on the
     folder if the user does not want the number to appear on the letter.
     5.2.3.7. (Added-62AW) Each squadron/staff agency should have one information manager to
     control, review and maintain all form memorandums. For large organizations with numerous
     branches and sections that have numerous form memorandums, your branch information manage-
     ment office should establish control. The wing’s Form Memorandum Monitor (62 CS/SCSA) will
     act as an advisor and will assist in the development of new form memorandums.

                                                  Chapter 6

                                           USE OF ENVELOPES

6.1. General Information. Local needs determine when to use envelopes, tags, and labels. See your
BITC or DoD 4525.8-M/AFSUP 1, DoD Official Mail Manual. Use standard addresses listed in the
address directory (see Chapter 9).

6.2. Envelope Size:
     6.2.1. Use a rectangular envelope only slightly larger than the correspondence. Envelopes should be
     no smaller than 3.5 by 5 inches and no larger than 6.125 by 11.5 inches.
     6.2.2. You may use window envelopes. Be sure to adjust the MEMORANDUM FOR element to align
     the address with the envelope window.
     6.2.3. For consolidated mailing, the largest item that cannot be folded determines the envelope size
     (see DoD 4525.8-M/AFSUP 1).
     6.2.3. (62AW) To preclude a surcharge by the United States Postal Service (USPS), activities will
     avoid sending First Class mail weighing one ounce or less and standard mail weighing two ounces or
     less in nonstandard envelopes.

6.3. Addressing the Envelope. For successful processing by optical character recognition (OCR) equip-
ment, the USPS requires addresses to be machine-printed, with a uniform left margin, and formatted in a
manner that allows an OCR to recognize the information.
     6.3.1. Printing. Since OCR equipment cannot process dot matrix styles where the dots do not touch,
     print addresses on a laser printer. You may not hand write or use rubber stamps unless laser printers
     and appropriate software are not available.
     6.3.2. Typeface. Use Courier New font 12 point (or similar simple sans serif font). Be sure characters
     are not too close together and do not touch or overlap. Do not use bold, italic, script, artistic, or other
     unusual typefaces.
     6.3.3. Margins. Leave margins at least 0.5-inch from the left and right edges of the envelope and at
     least 0.625-inch from the bottom of the envelope. The last line of the address should be no lower than
     0.625-inch and no higher than 2.75 inches from the bottom of the envelope.
     6.3.4. Address Format. See Figure 6.1. for address position and format. Use block style with a uni-
     form left margin, parallel to the long edge of the envelope. Single-space the address block and type the
     entire addresses in uppercase. Use one or two spaces between words. Do not use punctuation in the
     last two lines of the address block except for the dash in the ZIP+4 code. Addresses are limited to five
     lines:
        6.3.4.1. Optional Address Data Line. Use this line for any nonaddress data such as account num-
        bers, presort codes, or mail stop codes.
        6.3.4.2. Optional Attention Line. Use this line to direct mail to a specific person.
        6.3.4.3. Organization Abbreviation/Office Symbol Line. Use the organization abbreviation and
        office symbol separated by a virgule. Refer to the address directory for correct abbreviations.
AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003                                                                     35


       6.3.4.4. Delivery Address Line. Use this line for the street or post office (PO) box number, and the
       room or suite number. Use authorized USPS abbreviations found in USPS Publication 28. Do not
       use punctuation on this line.
       6.3.4.5. City or Base, State, ZIP+4 Code Line. Use the two-letter state abbreviations found in
       USPS Publication 28. Always include the ZIP+4 code in the address. Do not use commas between
       the city or base, abbreviation, and ZIP+4 code; the dash in the ZIP+4 code is the only punctuation
       used in the last address line. With overseas addresses, do not use the APO or FPO number and
       geographical location together; this will cause the mail to enter the international mail channels. Do
       not type any information below or to the right of the city, state, and ZIP+4 code address line.
   6.3.5. Return Address Format. Place the return address in the upper left corner of the envelope (see
   Figure 6.2.). Follow the address format (see paragraph 6.3.4.). Use the complete mailing address.
   Type "OFFICIAL BUSINESS" beneath the return address. (See DoD 4525.8-M/AFSUP 1).
   6.3.5. (62AW) Return addresses will not be handwritten. They can be typewritten, machine printed or
   rubber-stamped.

6.4. Machine-Processed Mailing. Limit the thickness of the envelope to 0.25 inch or less when sealed
(about four sheets of bond paper or eight tissue weight sheets). Press envelope to remove air. Write "non-
machinable" above the address on the envelope if it is more than 0.25 inch thick (see DoD 4525.8-M/
AFSUP 1).

6.5. Mailing Labels, Cards, and Self-Mailers. See DoD 4525.8-M/AFSUP 1.
6.5. (62AW) Mailing Labels, Cards and Self-Mailers. Approval is required by 62 CS Administrative
Communications Branch when requesting printing of mailing cards and self-mailers.

6.6. Preparation and Content of Mail Indicia. See DoD 4525.8-M/AFSUP 1.
6.6. (62AW) Preparation and Content of Mail Indicia. Approval is required by 62 CS Administrative
Communications Branch when requesting reprinted envelopes with the G-1 permit.

6.7. Preparing Envelopes for Classified Material. See DoD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401.

                                                Chapter 7

                          MESSAGE PREPARATION AND PROCESSING

7.1. Introduction . This chapter discusses preparing messages for AUTODIN. Contact your local tele-
communications center (TCC) for questions concerning message preparation or delivery. NOTE: DoD
mandates the use of DMS rather than AUTODIN for organizational messages; the intent of this mandate
is to migrate users from AUTODIN to the DMS. AUTODIN format is used in DMS when sending a mes-
sage to an AUTODIN user. AUTODIN service is scheduled to be discontinued in fiscal year 2000.

7.2. Originator's Responsibilities. The originator is the command or authority in whose name a mes-
sage is sent. The originator implements the policy and procedures for preparing and releasing messages.

7.3. Drafter's Responsibilities. The drafter writes messages following the procedures outlined in this
chapter. For United States Message Text Format (USMTF) message preparation, see Attachment 4.

7.4. Releaser's Responsibilities. The releaser is the individual authorized by the commander to release
messages and authorize recipients of self-generated messages. The releaser verifies message format is
correct; for example, messages originating from the same office do not use identical date time groups. The
releaser ensures timely delivery of messages to the TCC and avoids delivering messages to the TCC at the
close of business.

7.5. TCC Responsibilities. TCC distributes one copy of each message to the central point of distribution
for an organization. The distribution office reproduces and distributes the message as appropriate. Deliver
classified messages according to DoD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401. Do not task TCC personnel to pick up
messages from an originator or deliver messages to an addressee.

7.6. Addressee's Responsibilities. At locations where electrical distribution is not used, units establish
the central point of distribution for messages within their organization. Wing equivalent or higher may
establish central points of distribution for each office with two-letter office symbols. Units identify per-
sonnel authorized to pick up messages that require special handling and identify representatives for noti-
fication by telephone on receipt of PRIORITY or higher precedence messages. Units provide immediate
pickup of messages that are high precedence or those that require special handling. Use AF Form 74,
Communications Status Notice/Request, to acknowledge messages when required.

7.7. Message Preparation. Prepare messages on floppy diskette using Standard Automated Remote to
AUTODIN Host (SARAH) message preparation software such as SARAH-Lite, Defense Information
Infrastructure (DII) Common Operating Environment (COE) Compliant Message Processor, or the
Army’s DINAH-Mite. Using SARAH-Lite or another DII COE-Compliant Message Processor ensures
compatibility with AUTODIN and standardization. Handwritten messages are only authorized under the
following situations: in an emergency or time-critical situation and then only IMMEDIATE or above; or
Facility Checking Squadrons (FCS) and FAA Flight Inspection Field Offices (FIFO) aircraft commanders
when in a transient status and administrative support is not available. Do not use these procedures to cir-
cumvent normal message preparation procedures. Consult with your local TCC for procedures to submit
handwritten messages.
38                                                    AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003


7.8. General Message Format. Use only uppercase. Double-space all lines. Do not underline any part of
the message. Limit punctuation symbols to dollar sign ($), ampersand (&), open parenthesis ((), close
parenthesis ()), dash (-), apostrophe (‘), quotation mark (“), period (.), colon (:), virgule (/), comma (,),
question mark (?), and semicolon (;). AUTODIN will accept other punctuation symbols in the message
text; however, the receiving equipment may not be able to reproduce those symbols.

7.9. Message Fields:
     7.9.1. Date Time Group (DTG):
        7.9.1.1. Date/Time Block. Enter the time the message is authorized by the releaser. The first two
        digits represent the day of the current month and the next four digits represent the Universal Time
        Coordinated (UTC) (or Zulu time) from a 24-hour clock (see Figure 7.1.). Place a “Z” after these
        six digits.
        7.9.1.2. Month Block. Enter the first three letters of the current month.
        7.9.1.3. Year Block. Enter the last two digits of the year.
     7.9.2. Language Media Format (LMF) Block. This field specifies the media format for your message.
     Two characters are required. The first designates the originating format, and the second designates the
     destination format. Enter “AA” for ASCII format.
     7.9.3. Book Block. This option is not used by AUTODIN. Enter “NO.”
     7.9.4. Content Indicator Code (CIC) Block. The CIC identifies the message type. Enter “ZYUW” for
     narrative messages.
     7.9.5. SPECAT/SHD Block. Use this block for classified messages only; contact your local TCC for
     questions concerning SPECAT messages. If a message is SPECAT, the identifying letter must be
     entered five times. Identifying letters are:
        7.9.5.1. AAAAA for SPECAT SIOP-ESI.
        7.9.5.2. FFFFF for certain TOP SECRET United States-originated message traffic addressed to
        activities of the United Kingdom, or other classified messages that contain special-handling desig-
        nators, such as COSMIC, US-UK EYES ONLY, CRYPTO-SECURITY, and EXCLUSIVE FOR.
        7.9.5.3. LLLLL for Messages containing the special designator, ATOML, addressed to certain
        NATO commands.
        7.9.5.4. BBBBB for other type SPECAT.
     7.9.6. Originators Message Identification (OMI) Block. The OMI is used by your unit to identify the
     individual message. Enter your office symbol (no more than five letters) followed by the day and the
     local time. For example ITSI is sending a message on 7 July 1999 at 1300; the OMI will read
     ITSI071300. The OMI must be at least five characters long and the first two characters must be letters.
     7.9.7. Precedence Block. Message precedence prosigns are:
        7.9.7.1. YY --EMERGENCY COMMAND PRECEDENCE.
        7.9.7.2. ZZ --FLASH. Use for initial enemy contact messages or operational combat messages of
        extreme urgency.
AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003                                                                     39


       7.9.7.3. OO --IMMEDIATE. Use for very urgent messages relating to situations that gravely
       affect the security of National Forces, Allied Forces, or the populace.
       7.9.7.4. PP --PRIORITY. Use for messages about the conduct of operations in progress and for
       other important and urgent matters when ROUTINE precedence will not suffice.
       7.9.7.5. RR --ROUTINE. Use for all types of messages that justify transmission by rapid means
       but are not of sufficient urgency and importance to require higher precedence.
   7.9.8. Classification Block. The classification must be at least as high as the highest classification of
   any section of text contained in the message. Enter the letter group which represents the security clas-
   sification. The letter groups are: UUUU for Unclassified and FOUO, CCCC for Confidential, SSSS
   for Secret, and TTTT for Top Secret.
   7.9.9. Message Handling Instructions Block. Use this block for special instructions to the receiving
   TCC. An example would be “DELIVER DURING NORMAL DUTY HOURS ONLY.”
   7.9.10. Accounting Symbol Block. Accounting symbols are required on messages that use the com-
   mercial refile system. This information is typically not necessary and should be left blank.
   7.9.11. Text Classification Line Block. Use the text classification line for any caveat that directly
   modifies the classification of the message such as FOUO, NATO, Limited Distribution (LIMDIS), etc.
   7.9.12. Drafter’s Name and Title Block. Enter the drafter’s name and title.
   7.9.13. Drafter’s Office and Phone Block. Enter the drafter’s organization abbreviation, office sym-
   bol, and phone number.
   7.9.14. Special Instructions Block. Enter any special handling instructions for the message such as
   MINIMIZE CONSIDERED.
   7.9.15. Releaser’s Name, Title, Office Symbol, and Phone Block. Enter the releaser’s name, rank, and
   phone number.

7.10. Message Address. Use plain language addresses (PLA) listed in the directory services database
and standard office symbols (see Chapter 10). Use only the following authorized punctuation markings
in the address element: virgule (/), double virgule (//), hyphen (FIN-ACCTG), and apostrophe (O'HARA).
All address elements must contain the organization, geographical location, state or country. The location
is followed by double virgule, the office symbol, followed by double virgule. When the message is
addressed to two or more office symbols at the same organization, separate the office symbols by a vir-
gule.
   7.10.1. From Address. Enter your unit’s PLA and office symbol.
   7.10.2. To Address. Enter the PLA and office symbol for each action activity. You may use address
   indicator groups (AIG) as action addressees.
   7.10.3. Information (Info) Address. Enter the PLA and office symbol for each activity that needs the
   message for information purposes only. Do not use AIGs as info addressees.
   7.10.4. Exempt (XMT) Address. Use the XMT address to omit an address from an AIG listed in the
   “To Address.” Type the PLA and office symbol for the addressee that you do not wish to receive the
   message.

     7.10.5. Local Message Routing. Addressees that will receive the message other than electronic means
     (such as by mail or by messenger) are indicated by ZEN. The message originator, not the TCC, is
     responsible for delivery of ZEN messages. Use the local message routing field to remind you of distri-
     bution that you must make for ZEN addressees.

7.11. Message Text. Limit lines to 69 characters, including spaces. Include the following elements when
used:
     7.11.1. Security Classification. List the following information, in order, on the first line: security clas-
     sification, special handling designators, flagwords, code words, and exercise name. Insert a space
     between each letter of the classification, except for unclassified. Classified messages addressed to
     United States (US) activities for distribution to non-US activities must include releasability statements
     following the classification. Example: S E C R E T RELEASABLE TO NATO AS NATO SECRET.
     7.11.2. Delivery Instructions. If used, identify the specific addressee to whom the message is to be
     delivered. Type “FOR” followed by the name or position title when there is a specific person identi-
     fied for delivery. Type “PASS TO” for address instructions to direct the message to a particular orga-
     nization or unit.
     7.11.3. Subject Line. Type “SUBJ:” followed by a brief description of the message content. Limit the
     message subject to one line. Omit the message subject if its use will cause an unclassified message to
     be classified, if it increases the length of a short message, or if the subject is readily apparent in the
     first line of text. If the message is classified, identify the classification of the subject by the appropri-
     ate classification symbol.
     7.11.4. Action Suspense. The action suspense indicates when you need to complete the required
     action. Use it only when necessary. Type “SUSPENSE” followed by the required date.
     7.11.5. Message Division. You may divide a message into parts if portions of the message do not
     apply to all addressees.
     EXAMPLE:


     UNCLAS
     FOR (if needed)
     SUBJ: (if needed). SUSPENSE (if needed)
     THIS MESSAGE IN THREE PARTS
     PART ONE FOR PACAF,
     PART TWO FOR AETC,
     PART THREE FOR ALL

     7.11.6. Use references only when they are essential. When references are used, type their identifica-
     tion on the second or subsequent lines of text. Include the reference subject only when needed. If ref-
     erence is made to several messages, letters, memorandums, or other documents, type each on a
     separate line. Identify the references as A., B., and so on. When referencing a data pattern message,
     provide the CIC, time-of-file, and any other information (such as report control symbol [RCS]) that
     may help in identification.
AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003                                                                           41


    7.11.7. Main Body. Keep the main body brief. The length of a message directly affects the handling
    time within telecommunications channels. Use the paragraph format, standard punctuation, abbrevia-
    tions, and numbering as used in normal military correspondence. Begin all lines, including the first
    line of subparagraphs, flush with the left margin. For classified messages, mark all paragraphs and
    subparagraphs with their classification (DoD 5200.1-R /AFI 31-401) in the same manner as normal
    correspondence. The last line of the text must include declassification or downgrading instructions.
    For exercise messages, always use “EXERCISE” as the last words of the text, followed by the exer-
    cise identification and group markings.

7.12. Release Document. This file controls the flow of messages on a diskette from origination to trans-
mission. The release document lists all messages on the diskette and shows the status of each message.
There are three codes on a release document to indicate message status:
    7.12.1. MORE is used to indicate that the message needs additional coordination. Leave the date time
    group block blank to keep a message in this status. The TCC cannot transmit a MORE status message.
    7.12.2. REDY means the message is ready to send. The REDY status is generated by placing the date
    time group on the message.
    7.12.3. TXED indicates the message was sent by the TCC. When TXED is indicated, the TCC cannot
    retransmit the message from the diskette unless the message originator assigns a new date time group.
    7.12.4. The release document also contains a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) number. The CRC is
    used to ensure message integrity. The number on the release document and the message must match.
    The CRC number changes each time the message is modified, including adding the date time group.

7.13. Activities Not Served By AUTODIN. Send messages addressed to activities (civilian firms, indi-
viduals, and some isolated units) not served by military communications facilities by other means (e.g.,
telegram, electronic mail, courier, postal, facsimile, etc.). It is the originator's responsibility to obtain this
support. If in doubt about whether an addressee is served by military communications facilities, consult
your local TCC.

7.14. MINIMIZE. Users of AUTODIN must adhere to MINIMIZE when imposed for record communi-
cations. The objective of MINIMIZE is to clear AUTODIN of traffic whose urgency does not require
transmission by electrical means. Commanders at any level have the authority to impose MINIMIZE
within their command or area of command responsibility unless specified or denied by appropriate higher
authority. When MINIMIZE is imposed, commands will:
    7.14.1. Establish rigid procedures to ensure that record communications (narrative and data mes-
    sages) which do not meet the MINIMIZE criteria are forwarded by other means (e.g., mail, courier).
    Do not hold record communications for transmission pending cancellation of MINIMIZE. This prac-
    tice would seriously overload the network after the MINIMIZE is canceled.
    7.14.2. Require releasing officers to review all record traffic that was not released or released but not
    yet sent by the TCC to ensure it qualifies for release under the provisions in force and the words
    "MINIMIZE CONSIDERED" are stated on the message release document. Never make MINIMIZE
    CONSIDERED part of the message text.

     7.14.3. When MINIMIZE is canceled, commanders will ensure a review is made of the messages
     transmitted during MINIMIZE to check the effectiveness of MINIMIZE policies and procedures and
     take action to correct deficiencies.
AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003                                                                      43


Figure 7.1. Comparative Time Chart.




To determine the DTG without having to constantly refer to this chart, find the total hours difference
between your local time and “Z” time and add or subtract as follows:

First find your time zone, (ask your TCC if you are not sure of your zone), then count the number of
time zones between your zone and the “Z” zone (include the “Z” zone in your count, but not your own
zone). Finally, if your zone is to the left of “Z” zone on the above chart, add the total number of zones to
your local time; if your zone is to the right, subtract the number of zones from your local time. The
result is “Z” time.

Example: Washington (R Zone) is five zones to the left of “Z” zone. Therefore, the DTG entry on a
message originated in Washington DC is local time plus five hours. Likewise the DTG entry for a
message originated in India is local time minus five hours. (If daylight savings time is in effect, add one
less hour if you are to the left of “Z” time or subtract one more hour if you are to the right.)

                ADMINISTRATIVE COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT FORMS

8.1. Optional Form (OF) 27, United States Government Two-Way Memo. Use this form for corre-
spondence that is less formal than the official memorandum. You should handwrite it in brief, informal
language. Its intent is to save time required for typing and correcting and to save the cost of duplicating.
The originator forwards the original and one copy and keeps the third copy as a record. The receiver uses
Reply block, keeps the original, and returns the second copy to the originator.

8.2. Optional Form (OF) 41, Routing and Transmittal Slip. This form serves as a routing and trans-
mittal slip for correspondence and publications and to comment on a document that is being routed within
or outside your activity.
     8.2.1. Type or write out entries. Continue your remarks on the back, if needed.
     8.2.2. Show the action for each addressee by entering in the action block the line number on which
     the individual's name appears.
     8.2.3. You may use this form to request concurrence or approval, but not as a record of it. Formal
     approval of action requested should be accomplished by signature on the document or by coordination
     on the file copy.
     8.2.4. Return the form to the sender by turning down the FROM block over the back of the form. Line
     out FROM, insert TO, and write your comments on the back.

8.3. Optional Form (OF) 363, Memorandum of Call. Use this form to pass telephone messages or
inform someone of a visitor.

8.4. AF Form 74, Communication Status Notice/Request. Use this form to let senders know the status
of their correspondence. You may document comments on the record copy. You may use the AF Form 74
Remarks section for notification of official Air Force business other than communications status, as
authorized by your MAJCOM. You can use the form as a postcard between activities serviced either by
the military distribution system or the USPS.

8.5. AF Form 388, Communication Control Record. Use this form only when you require formal sus-
pense controls. Use it when you receive correspondence and need to assign action within your office or to
a lower office, or use it to track correspondence requiring a reply by a specific date. When you use this
form:
     8.5.1. File the original or a copy by the suspense date and attach all other copies to the correspon-
     dence.
     8.5.2. Show any extension of the suspense date on the form and refile accordingly.

8.6. AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet. Use the staff summary sheet (SSS) to summarize staff
work, to request action, or to forward information. Since it often contains several handwritten notes
before reaching the approval authority, SSSs do not require the same level of perfection (error-free typing,
etc.) as the correspondence they may cover. Correct errors neatly and legibly in ink if the content and
AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003                                                                    45


meaning are still legible and clear. Generally, limit it to one page. Use plain bond paper if an additional
page is required (see Figure 8.1.). If more than ten offices coordinate on the original SSS, use a blank AF
Form 1768, and renumber the TO block, starting with 11. Complete the form through the subject and
attach it behind the original SSS. See Figure 8.2. for assembling SSS packages. Coordination on Staff
Summary Sheet is as follows:
   8.6.1. When you agree with the proposed action, sign your surname, rank or grade, and date on the
   bottom line if you are the addressee; sign on the top line if you are not the addressee.
   8.6.2. When you do not agree with the proposed action, write a memorandum to the action office stat-
   ing your reasons and write in ink "See Memorandum" in the signature column of the SSS after your
   office symbol. Attach your memorandum to the SSS and return it to the action office.
   8.6.3. When you receive a nonconcurrence on a SSS, try to resolve all differences.
       8.6.3.1. If you cannot resolve the differences, the action officer writes a rebuttal memorandum to
       the approval authority which states differences discussed with the nonconcurring official and
       gives your reasons why you cannot change the proposed action. Attach the rebuttal memorandum
       and the nonconcurrence memorandum as the last tab to the original SSS, and annotate in pen the
       additional tab under the list of tabs. Send the SSS to the next addressee shown on the form.
       8.6.3.2. If you resolve differences and no changes are made to the SSS or to any attachments, the
       previously nonconcurring official shows concurrence by marking through the statement "See
       Memorandum" and signing surname, rank or grade, and date. The action officer annotates "Differ-
       ences resolved and no changes needed" on the nonconcurrence memorandum, initials the state-
       ment, and attaches this memorandum to the record or coordination copy. Route the SSS to the next
       addressee shown on the form.
       8.6.3.3. If you resolve your differences and changes are made to the SSS or to any attachments,
       the action officer prepares a new SSS and coordinates it as a new package with all offices.

                               AIR FORCE ADDRESS DIRECTORY

9.1. Purpose of the System. The address directory contains official addresses of Air Force activities.
These addresses include the complete mailing address for all major Air Force organizations and the PLA
for messages; and the Defense switched network (DSN) telephone numbers and facsimile (FAX) numbers
for some units. Using the correct address allows for direct delivery of communications and parcels to the
desired addressee and expedites the processing and delivery of communications. Reference the address
directory for the correct mailing address when preparing envelopes.

9.2. Access to the Directory. The address directory is located on the World Wide Web (WWW) at
http://afdir.hq.af.mil. The intent of the address directory is to provide Air Force and other government
users a simple and easy way to obtain address information on an occasional basis. Users who require an
off-line electronic copy of the directory may download a copy from the site. Users who do not have access
to the WWW and require a copy should contact their local Defense Automated Printing Service (DAPS).
Direct specific questions about the address directory through appropriate channels to HQ AFCA/GCO,
203 W. Losey St., Room 1020, Scott AFB IL 62225-5222.

9.3. Preparing Communications for Dispatch. Place the organization abbreviation, office symbol,
street address, room or suite number, geographic location, and ZIP+4 code on the envelope as shown in
Chapter 6. The term headquarters (HQ) is a part of the official title of units at group level and above
according to AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization. Use HQ as part of the mailing address when corre-
sponding with staff elements at MAJCOM and HQ USAF organizations. Do not use the term HQ when
corresponding with the office of the commander, vice commander, or chief of staff.
EXAMPLE:


                 Complete Mailing Address for 8th Air Force Logistics Barksdale AFB
                                           HQ 8 AF/LG
                                    245 DAVIS AVE RM 100
                                BARKSDALE AFB LA 71110-2280

9.4. Functional Area Responsibilities:
   9.4.1. Information Systems Division (HQ AFCA/GCO). HQ AFCA/GCO develops, manages, and
   provides guidance for the address directory. It creates accounts for MAJCOM, FOA, and direct report-
   ing unit (DRU) address managers. It may create accounts for base-level address representative, when
   necessary. It also examines address data for consistency.
   9.4.2. MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU Communications and Information (SC) Staffs. Headquarters SC
   staffs appoint address managers and inform HQ AFCA/GCO of address manager appointments.
   9.4.3. MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU Address Managers (MAJCOM Rep). These managers implement
   and monitor the system within their command or agency. They are responsible for addresses of units
   assigned to the respective MAJCOM. They verify that addresses are correct and may add, change, or
   delete addresses. They also create accounts for base-level address representatives.
50                                                    AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003


     9.4.4. Base-Level Address Representatives (Base Rep). These representatives are responsible for
     addresses of units on the respective base including tenant units. They may add, change, or delete
     addresses. They enter address information consistent with data entry instructions.

9.5. System Data Maintenance:
     9.5.1. Minimum Address Records. At a minimum, the address directory must contain all addresses
     for Air Force activities that receive official mail at a separate address and Air Force activities that
     have a unique PLA. Do not include sensitive addresses.
     9.5.2. Requesting Address Updates. Organizations should contact the respective Base Rep to request
     address updates. If there is no Base Rep, then the organization should contact the respective MAJ-
     COM Rep.
     9.5.3. Address Fields:
        9.5.3.1. Organization Field (Required). Contains the name of the organization written in its
        entirety. For example, use 35TH FIGHTER WING versus 35 FW; AIR FORCE PENTAGON
        COMMUNICATIONS AGENCY versus AFPCA. Use Arabic numerals to designate units up to
        and including wings, and add th, d or st to the number. Spell out the number for numbered air
        forces; for example, 19TH LOGISTICS GROUP, and NINTH AIR FORCE. The term “Headquar-
        ters” is a part of the official title of units at group level and above. Use “Headquarters” as part of
        the organization name with staff elements at MAJCOM and HQ USAF organizations; do not use
        “Headquarters” as part of the organization name with the office of the commander, vice com-
        mander, or chief of staff.
        9.5.3.2. Abbreviation Field (Required). Contains the abbreviated name of the organization. Use

        AFPCA versus AIR FORCE PENTAGON COMMUNICATIONS AGENCY; 9 AF versus
        NINTH AIR FORCE.
        9.5.3.3. MAJCOM Field (Required). Contains the abbreviation of the MAJCOM to which the
        organization reports. Do not duplicate the abbreviation of the organization in this field unless the
        organization is the headquarters of the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU.
        9.5.3.4. Site Field (Required). Contains the name of the Air Force base, military installation, or
        city where the organization resides. For example: KIRTLAND AFB or NEW MEXICO.

        example: 311 ELDORADO AVE STE 35. Use only approved abbreviations as shown in USPS
        Publication 28, Postal Addressing Standards. Avoid use of punctuation such as commas, etc.
        9.5.3.6. Street Address 2 Field (Optional). Use this field when second delivery address line is
        needed, such as an address requiring the Air Force base name and the city name.
        9.5.3.7. Address Type Field (Required). Select the appropriate designation of Continental United
        States (CONUS) APO or FPO.
        9.5.3.8. State Field (Required). Contains the abbreviation of the state or geographic area where
        the organization resides. Use standard state abbreviations (see USPS Publication 28). If the

AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003                                                                     51


       the Middle East, and Africa. AP designates Armed Forces in the Pacific. AA designates Armed
       Forces in Central America and South America.
       9.5.3.9. Postal Code Field (Required). Contains the ZIP+4 code for the organization. Always pro-
       vide 9-digit ZIP codes.
       9.5.3.10. Web Address Field (Optional). Contains the URL for an organizational web page. Omit
       “http://” when you enter the URL; for example, enter “www.cio.hq.af.mil/” rather than “http://
       www.cio.hq.af.mil/.” The prefix “http://” will be appended automatically.

                                                 Chapter 10

                                    STANDARD OFFICE SYMBOLS

10.1. Standard Office Symbols. Office symbols identify the organization structure and functional
responsibility of an office. Major functions have two-letter symbols, e.g., logistics -- LG, personnel -- DP,
surgeon -- SG. Since basic functions report to major functions, basic functions have three-letter (or more)
symbols, e.g., transportation -- LGT, assignments -- DPA, dental -- SGD. A basic function’s office symbol
starts with the same letters as the parent function’s office symbol, and adds one more letter.
     10.1.1. An office symbol used within only one MAJCOM or FOA is a command-unique office sym-
     bol.
     10.1.2. An office symbol used by more than one MAJCOM is a standard office symbol. Standard
     office symbols simplify addressing, effectively express organization function, and allow writers to
     communicate across the Air Force. The list of standard office symbols is maintained in the Air Force
     Address Directory (see Chapter 9).

10.2. Office Symbol Use. Use approved organization abbreviations and office symbols on correspon-
dence, messages, forms, etc. When addressing an office, add the numerical designation and organization
abbreviation before the office symbol, and separate the two with a virgule, e.g., 375 LG/LGT or HQ ACC/
SC. Emphasize the use of CC for organizational commanders. (NOTE: While command relationship must
be stressed at base level, communications between MAJCOM and HQ USAF functional entities, particu-
larly messages, need to use functional office symbols, e.g., LG, SC, CE, etc. Never use both symbols on
the same communication, e.g., the supply squadron commander can use either CC when acting as a unit
commander or LGS to represent the functional role as chief of supply.)

10.3. Assigning Office Symbols:
     10.3.1. The official list of standard office symbols is maintained in the Air Force address directory
     (see Chapter 9). Standard office symbols are based on AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization, and
     departmental directives issued by HQ USAF that outline organizational and functional structure.
     MAJCOM and FOA communications and information staffs will provide lists of command-unique
     office symbols. When possible, office symbols share the same letters and titles at HQ USAF, MAJ-
     COM, and base level.
     10.3.2. Each major function within the Air Force is assigned a two-letter office symbol; wing staff,
     group, and squadrons within the operations group and support group will have two-letter office sym-
     bols. Basic functions are assigned three-letter (or more) office symbols. Some major functions include
     basic functions that are similar in title and function to another major function, e.g., the major function
     of personnel, DP, may have a basic function of plans. Since all office symbols within a function must
     start with the same two letters, the personnel plans function should use the office symbol DPX rather
     than XP so that the basic function is not confused with a major function.

10.4. Functional Area Responsibilities:
     10.4.1. HQ AFCA/GCO establishes and manages the official list of standard office symbols. It pro-
     vides guidance for the system.
AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003                                                                53


   10.4.2. MAJCOM and FOA communications and information staffs establish and manage lists of
   command-unique office symbols. They provide procedures for coordination and establishing new
   command-unique office symbols. They provide current lists of command-unique office symbols to
   HQ AFCA/GCO. They may propose new standard office symbols.
   10.4.3. Local communications and information staffs assign office symbols to serviced organizations.
   10.4.4. Organizations must provide lists of office symbols and office names to their local BITC and
   message center to ensure mail delivery. When changing office symbols, include old office name and
   symbol, new office name and symbol, and building number.

10.5. Requesting Office Symbols:
   10.5.1. Since titles can be misleading, organizations must request office symbols from their local
   communications and information staffs. Requests must include functional statements, organizational
   charts, and whenever possible, proposed office symbols. Organizations must use current standard
   office symbols or command-unique office symbols when they reorganize. Once approved, organiza-
   tions will include the old office symbol with the new office symbol when announcing reorganizations.
   10.5.2. Local communications and information staffs must coordinate with MAJCOM communica-
   tions and information staffs before assigning new office symbols. MAJCOM and FOA communica-
   tions and information staffs will establish procedures for coordination and establishing new
   command-unique office symbols. Do not create command-unique office symbols which duplicate
   standard office symbols.
   10.5.3. MAJCOM and FOA communications and information staffs will inform HQ AFCA/GCO
   when establishing new command-unique office symbols, and provide current lists of com-
   mand-unique office symbols.
   10.5.4. MAJCOM and FOA communications and information staffs, HQ USAF/XPMO, and HQ
   USAF major functions may propose new standard office symbols. Send requests to HQ AFCA/GCO.
   HQ AFCA/GCO will coordinate with HQ USAF/XPMO and HQ USAF major functions to establish
   new standard office symbols.
   10.5.5. Do not use office symbols until approved through the appropriate channels.

10.6. Forms Prescribed. AF Form 74, Communication Status Notice/Request; AF Form 388, Com-
munication Control Record; AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet; Optional Form 27, United States
Government Two-Way Memo; and Optional Form 363, Memorandum of Call.

                            DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE SEAL
NOTE: Refer questions about this attachment to Air Force Historical Research Agency (AFHRA/RS),
600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB AL 38112-6424.

A2.1. Functional Area Responsibilities:
   A2.1.1. Office of the Secretary of the Air Force. The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the
   Air Force (SAF/AA) is the custodian of the Air Force seal (Figure A2.1.) and is solely responsible for
   approving the use of its impression on official departmental documents and records.
   A2.1.2. AFHRA approves use of facsimiles of the seal. This includes use on insignia, flags, medals,
   and similar items. AFHRA also approves requests from industry or Air Force groups for use of other
   parts of the seal.
   A2.1.3. Communications and Information. The Director of Communications and Information (HQ
   USAF/SC) approves the manner in which the seal is used on printed material.

A2.2. Description and Significance. The official Air Force colors of ultramarine blue (Pantone Match-
ing System [PMS] Reflex Blue) and Air Force yellow (PMS 116) are used prominently on the Air Force
seal (see AFI 84-105, Organizational Lineage, Honors, and Heraldry). The seal is described as follows:
   A2.2.1. A circular disc of ultramarine blue edged with a narrow Air Force yellow border.
       A2.2.1.1. Centered on the disc, the Air Force coat of arms, consisting of the crest and shield.
       A2.2.1.2. The crest is made up of the eagle, wreath, and cloud form. The American bald eagle
       symbolizes the United States and its air power and is depicted in its natural colors. The wreath
       under the eagle is made up of six alternate folds of metal and light blue. This repeats the metal and
       color used in the shield. The white clouds behind the eagle denote the start of a new sky.
       A2.2.1.3. The shield, directly below the eagle and wreath, is divided horizontally into two parts
       by a nebular line representing clouds. The top part bears an Air Force yellow thunderbolt with
       flames in natural color which shows striking power through the use of aerospace. The thunderbolt
       consists of an Air Force yellow vertical twist with three natural color flames on each end crossing
       a pair of horizontal wings with eight lightning bolts. The background of the top part is light blue
       representing the sky. The lower part is white representing metal silver.
   A2.2.2. The 13 white encircling stars represent the original 13 colonies.
   A2.2.3. The Air Force yellow numerals under the shield are 1947. This is the year the Department of
   the Air Force was established.
   A2.2.4. The band encircling the whole design is white edged in Air Force yellow with black lettering.
   The inscriptions read "Department of the Air Force" on the top part and "United States of America" on
   the lower part.

A2.3. Use of the Seal. The seal is permitted only as outlined in this attachment. Falsely making, forging,
counterfeiting, mutilating, or altering the seal, or knowingly using or possessing with fraudulent intent is
60                                                     AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003


punishable by law (Title 18 U.S.C. 506, Crimes and Criminal Procedure). Display of the seal is allowed
in certain instances. Commanders make sure the display is in good taste and appropriate to the occasion.
     A2.3.1. Authorized Users. Commanders of major commands (MAJCOM), field operating agencies
     (FOA), direct reporting units (DRU), Air Force missions, military assistance advisory groups, air
     attaches, professors of aerospace studies, and Air Force general officers may use the Air Force seal in
     the performance of their official duties. Museums may use the seal when specifically authorized by
     AFHRA.
     A2.3.2. Authorized Uses. You may use the seal or any part of it--in black and white, color mono-
     chrome reproduction, pictorial, or sculptured relief--as follows:
        A2.3.2.1. On printing issued at departmental level for general Air Force use.
        A2.3.2.2. In official Air Force films, videotapes, or television programs.
        A2.3.2.3. On programs, certificates, diplomas, invitations, and greetings of an official nature.
        A2.3.2.4. On memorials or monuments erected or approved by the Department of the Air Force.
        A2.3.2.5. With any official Air Force exhibit.
        A2.3.2.6. On wall plaques at Air Force facilities with the approval of the appropriate commander
        or agency chief.
     A2.3.3. Unauthorized Uses. The seal will not be used in any way which implies Air Force use or
     endorsement of an item. For example:
        A2.3.3.1. Air Force property and equipment for identification.
        A2.3.3.2. Souvenir or novelty items.
        A2.3.3.3. Printed matter copied or collected by an Air Force activity, except as shown in para-
        graph A2.3.2.
        A2.3.3.4. Toys or commercial gifts and premiums.
        A2.3.3.5. Stationery as a letterhead design.

       lar devices.
       A2.4.1.2. Nonofficial use on articles of jewelry such as watches, rings, tie clasps, cuff links,
       bracelets, cigarette lighters, and similar articles when appropriate and in good taste. Approval is
       given with the understanding that such usage in no way reflects Air Force endorsement of the
       product involved.
   A2.4.2. The coat of arms without encircling stars may be used by active duty, reserve, and retired Air
   Force military personnel without AFHRA approval as ornamentation on:
       A2.4.2.1. Personal stationery or framed for display in the home as a painting or a wall plaque.
       A2.4.2.2. Civilian jackets or blazers of conservative color. Authorized personnel are expected to
       protect the dignity of the Air Force Coat of Arms by ensuring that its display is in good taste and
       appropriate to the occasion.

A2.5. Use of the Crest. The crest (Figure A2.4. and Figure A2.5.) with or without encircling stars, may
be used by commanders on approved organizational emblems for ornamentation purposes. This authori-
zation is restricted to heraldic-type emblems of organizations group level or higher. The colors in the
wreath beneath the eagle will be as shown in paragraph A2.2.1.2. Use of the crest should not be taken as
authority for changing and or modifying Air Force flags.

                                            Attachment 3

         ADDRESS INDICATOR GROUPS (AIG) AND CATEGORICAL ADDRESSES
NOTE: The OPR for this attachment is Air Force Communications and Information Center, Transmission
Systems Branch (HQ AFCIC/SYNT).

A3.1. AIG Management. An AIG is a group of addresses to whom messages are sent at least twice a
month. Represented by a number, the AIG must not contain less than sixteen action and information
addresses. Use AIGs to reduce the number of addresses in the message heading.
   A3.1.1. The Air Force control authority for AIGs is HQ AFCIC/SYNT, 1250 Air Force Pentagon,
   Washington DC 20330-1250.
   A3.1.2. The AIG manager is the agency responsible for the assignment and control of AIGs. HQ
   AFCIC/SYNT makes block assignments of Air Force AIGs to the AIG managers of Headquarters
   United States Air Force (HQ USAF), major commands (MAJCOM), and field operating agencies
   (FOA). MAJCOM and FOA representatives, as command agency or agency AIG managers, are
   responsible for assignment and control of AIG blocks within their command. They may allocate AIGs
   to their intermediate command representatives who will act as subcommand AIG managers. Within
   their area of responsibility and for those AIGs they control, AIG managers will:
      A3.1.2.1. Receive, check, and approve or disapprove requests for AIG assignments.
      A3.1.2.2. Issue AIG numbers to requesting authorities.
      A3.1.2.3. Keep a current list of AIG assignments. The list will contain each AIG number, its orig-
      inating authority, complete mailing address, a point of contact, telephone number (Defense
      switched network [DSN] or commercial), brief description of what the AIG is used for, address
      composition, classification, and those authorized to use the AIG as designated by the applicable
      authority.
   A3.1.3. The originating authority (holder) for an AIG is the activity to which the AIG manager
   assigns the AIG and the responsibility for its use and administration. AIG managers will:
      A3.1.3.1. Assign only AIGs that are needed and keep address composition current.
      A3.1.3.2. Allow only authorized message originators use of the AIGs.
      A3.1.3.3. Ensure addressees on all messages are originated by the authorized users. (Do not send
      copies to the Air Force control authority.)
          A3.1.3.3.1. Sequentially number modifications following the recapitulation that consists only
          of address additions, deletions, and changes.
          A3.1.3.3.2. Cancellation of an AIG consists of identifying AIGs that are no longer needed and
          publishing a notice that terminates their use. The canceling authority keeps canceled AIGs and
          includes the statement, "AIG XXXX is retained for future assignment by MAJCOM/FOA" in
          the cancellation notice.
          A3.1.3.3.3. Recapitulations of an AIG consist of publishing an accurately revised total
          address composition. Do this at least once a year when numerous modifications are made. All
          recapitulations should include a restatement of the information provided by the promulgation.
66                                                    AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003


            A3.1.3.3.4. Send establishments, modifications, cancellations, or recapitulations of AIGs to
            NAVCSRF HONOLULU HI//N31DB// (Naval Common Source Routing File), for informa-
            tion.
            A3.1.3.3.5. Maintain record of promulgations, modifications, recapitulations, and cancella-
            tions in accordance with local regulations. Provide copies of these to the servicing telecommu-
            nication center (TCC) on a timely basis. When addressees are added to the composition by
            modification, provide new members a copy of the promulgation or last recapitulation and any
            modifications that were issued.
     A3.1.4. Subordinate commands, activities, or components will request AIGs by electronic mail
     (E-mail) or sending a memorandum to the local AIG manager. Request should include:
        A3.1.4.1. Identification of the command, activity, organization, and originating authority.
        A3.1.4.2. Description, classification, purpose, and classification of the purpose of the AIG.
        A3.1.4.3. Estimated frequency of use.
        A3.1.4.4. Proposed list of addressees, including action and information addressees' office sym-
        bols, authorized users, and the classification of the address composition.
     A3.1.5. Use activities listed in the directory services database for the address composition of AIGs. In
     addition:
        A3.1.5.1. AIGs with less than sixteen addresses are not authorized.
        A3.1.5.2. Do not use office symbols in the address composition unless clarifying instructions are
        included in the message text by the originator.
        A3.1.5.3. Collective address designators, such as ALMAJCOM, are not authorized within an
        AIG. They may be included as an additional addressee of the message.
        A3.1.5.4. Do not include addressees of other nations, such as International Pact Organizations
        (IPO), non-Department of Defense (DoD), or DoD addressees served by non-DoD TCCs. You
        may include Allied or North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) message addressees only as
        add-on addressees. The TCC serving the originator is responsible for notifying the message origi-
        nator that a particular addressee is served by a non-United States Government TCC. The TCC and
        originator must ensure that message addresses that require application of a transmission release
        code (TRC) are not included in the composition of an AIG. Include TRC addresses as an add-on
        addressee.
     A3.1.6. Only the originating authority and those activities designated by the originating authority
     may use an AIG. The following applies:
        A3.1.6.1. When an AIG is authorized, message originators must put their address and office sym-
        bol in the "from" element of the message.
        A3.1.6.2. When addressing an AIG, office symbols are shown externally. When office symbols
        are added externally, they replace any contained within the AIG. If external office symbols are
        used in conjunction with an AIG, the internal office symbol is not delivered to the addressee.
        A3.1.6.3. If action addressees are changed to information addressees, or vice versa, the message
        originator states this in the message text.
AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003                                                                    67


      A3.1.6.4. When two or more AIGs are used and an addressee is listed in more than one AIG,
      TCCs must prevent duplicate delivery. If the addressee of an AIG does not correspond to the
      desired addressees, add or exempt addressees, as necessary.
      A3.1.6.5. Add-on addressees may not know the address composition of the addressed AIGs. If the
      originator thinks this information is important to the add-on addressees, the originator will provide
      them the address list on request.
      A3.1.6.6. The TCC is not responsible for providing an addressee the composition of an AIG; such
      requests should be referred to the AIG manager.
   A3.1.7. Addressees must tell their servicing TCC when they are included in an AIG and if they are
   authorized to use it. They must furnish the TCC a copy of any establishments, recapitulations, modi-
   fications, or cancellations of the AIG.
      A3.1.7.1. Do not readdress AIG messages, except in operational emergencies, unless the read-
      dressing action is to addressees not included in the original transmission. If the operational
      urgency of the subject does not allow time for an AIG address composition review, then readdress
      the message with add-on addressees.
      A3.1.7.2. If addressees determine that they no longer need to be included in an AIG or if their
      titles or addresses change, they will inform the originating authority by memorandum or message.

A3.2. Categorical Addresses:
   A3.2.1. These addresses are used by an activity when corresponding with its subordinate units. They
   are either for a single type of unit (e.g., "All USAFE Wings" or "All ACC Consolidated Base Person-
   nel Offices") or a combination of units (e.g., "All ACC Numbered Air Forces and the 1st Fighter
   Wing"). When established, include categorical addresses in supplements to this manual for easy refer-
   ence.
   A3.2.2. The following categorical addresses are established for use only by HQ USAF. Use one of
   these addresses with an office symbol, preceded by a slash, or a functional element in parentheses:
   ALMAJCOM - Is sent to all MAJCOMs only: for example, ALMAJCOM.
   ALMAJCOM-FOA - Is sent to all MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs: for example, ALMAJCOM-FOA/
   LG.

NOTES:
  To add selected FOAs to the distribution of an ALMAJCOM memorandum, list those FOAs after
  ALMAJCOM in the "TO" element of a memorandum: for example, ALMAJCOM AFISC AFAA
  (Manpower).
   ALZICOM - Is sent to CONUS MAJCOMs only: for example, ALZICOM/IG.
   ALZICOM-FOA - Is sent to all CONUS MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs, e.g., ALZICOM-FOA/SP.
   To add selected FOAs to the distribution of an ALZICOM memorandum, list those FOAs after ALZ-
   ICOM in the "TO" element of a memorandum: e.g., ALZICOM AFIS AFTEC AFAFC (Operations).

             UNITED STATES MESSAGE TEXT FORMAT (USMTF) PREPARATION
NOTE: The OPR for this attachment is the Aerospace Command and Control and Intelligence, Surveil-
lance and Reconnaissance Center (AC2ISRC/C2FM).

A4.1. Introduction. This attachment provides the basic rules for USMTF messages. It is not intended to
give specific procedures for drafting and distribution of all USMTFs. All messages (USMTF and General
Service) have a heading, text, and ending. The heading and ending formats for preparing USMTF mes-
sages are the same as Automatic Digital Network (AUTODIN) messages (see Chapter 7). The text or
body of the message is the only portion covered by USMTF rules. Air Force Pamphlet (AFP) 102-2, Vol-
ume 3, US Message Text Formats Self-Paced Training Pamphlet, provides specific guidance on preparing
the text of a USMTF message. Use of software preparation aids, such as the Defense information infra-
structure (DII) Common operating environment (COE) Message Processor is recommended for complex
USMTFs. The DII COE Message Processor is a jointly developed standard software package with various
output capabilities to produce an error-free USMTF. This includes the capability to create a message on a
Standard Automated Remote to AUTODIN Host (SARAH) disk. The USMTF program objective
enhances joint and combat effectiveness through standardization of message formats, data elements, and
information exchange procedures. USMTFs result in the services using the same messages with the same
information content. USMTFs thus provide commanders a common message format and common lan-
guage--both indispensable to successful joint operations.

A4.2. USMTF Text Components:
     A4.2.1. Set. The set is the basic building block of all USMTF messages. A set is like a sentence. It
     contains information about one subject. The SET name tells the reader (and the computer) what infor-
     mation is in the set.
     A4.2.2. Field. The field is the basic building block of a set. A set is made up of words. If the field has
     a descriptor, it describes the information in the field.
     A4.2.3. Linear Set. Fields arranged in a line across the page form a linear set.
     A4.2.4. Columnar Set. Fields arranged in columns (like columns of numbers in a table) form a colum-
     nar set.
     A4.2.5. Free-Text Set. Free-text set allows use of "plain language" in a formatted message. Write
     free-text set entries in lines, columns, sentences, or paragraph. Use whatever form is best to get your
     idea across. Use free-text sets to give additional details or information that does not fit into linear or
     columnar sets.
     A4.2.6. Authorized Entry/Authorized Entry Code. Only use authorized entry codes in some fields.
     See AFP 102-2, Volume 3, for guidance. These entries are often abbreviations.
     A4.2.7. Heading. Some sets are grouped under headings. These headings divide the message into sev-
     eral parts. Each part is a separate topic within the message.

A4.3. Allowable Characters. Ninety-eight characters are available for use in USMTF messages. They
are, by type, 26 alphabetic characters [A through Z], 10 numeric characters [0 through 9], 6 special char-
acters [ . , - ( ) ? ], the colon [:], the field marker [ / ], the space [ or blank ] character, 26 lowercase letters
AFMAN33-326_62AWSUP1_I 12 MARCH 2003                                                                        69


[ a through z ], 3 nonprinting ASCII control codes [horizontal tab, carriage return, line feed], and 26
extended special characters [ ! @ # $ % ^ & * = _ + [ ] { } \ “ ‘ ; < > ~ ` | ]. Message drafters should refer
to AFP 102-2, Volume 3, since some of these characters have restricted uses.

A4.4. Special Symbols:
   A4.4.1. Field Marker. A single virgule (/) indicates the start of a field. It takes up one character space,
   and goes before the field entry and on the same line with the first field entry.
   A4.4.2. End-of-Set Marker. A double virgule (//) indicates the end of a set. It takes up two character
   spaces, and both virgules must be on the same line. If a set ends on the last or next to last space in a
   line, put the // at the beginning of the next line. Do not use the // for anything other than an end-of-set
   marker.
   A4.4.3. No Data Sign. The no data sign is a hyphen (-). Use it when a field entry is required but the
   information is unknown or not available. For example:
       A4.4.3.1. A field designated as a mandatory field must contain an entry, even if the entry is only
       a no data sign.
       A4.4.3.2. A no data sign must be entered in a conditional or optional field if another field further
       along in the same set has an entry.

A4.5. Segment-Set-Field Usage Categories. All segments, sets, and fields have usage categories of
mandatory, conditional, or optional. These categories specify if the segment, set, or field must contain an
entry. AFP 102-2, Volume 3, lists the category for each segment, set, and field in the message.

A4.6. Message Preparation. Follow the instructions in Attachment 2 to fill out the heading and ending
(addressees, classification, etc.). Begin the first line of the USMTF text on the next line below the last ele-
ment used for the heading from Attachment 2. Type the first letter or special character for each line of
text flush with the left margin, with a maximum of 69 characters on any line. Each USMTF message
begins with a combination of the following initial sets. Use them in the order listed.
   A4.6.1. EXER or OPER (EXERcise or OPERation). For daily routine message traffic, neither set is
   used.
   A4.6.2. MSGID (MeSsaGe ID). A mandatory set. It tells the reader which format to expect for the
   message and conveys information about the subject of the message.
   A4.6.3. REF (REFerence). Identifies to the reader any previous communications or correspondence
   that affect the message. If no material is being referenced, this set is not used.
   A4.6.4. AMPN (AMPlificatioN). Used to amplify the previous REF set. If no amplification of the
   previous REF set is required, this set is not used.
   A4.6.5. NARR (NARRative). Used to provide information about previously used REF and AMPN
   sets. If no additional information about the previous sets is necessary, this set is not used.

A4.7. Rules and Complex Structure. Numerous rules and complex structure of USMTFs require the
message drafter to use AFP 102-2, Volume 3 or the DII COE Message Processor. Formatting errors defeat
the purpose of the USMTF program.

A4.8. General Messages. The following USMTFs are general administrative messages:
     A4.8.1. AKNLDG (AcKNowLeDGe). Used to acknowledge receipt of a message and to indicate
     planned or accomplished action. Transmittal of the message implies understanding of the received
     message.
     A4.8.2. GENADMIN (GENeral ADMINistrative). Used to pass administrative information. It is
     intended to allow reporting information not yet accommodated by other USMTF messages and is not
     intended for use in place of the existing USMTF messages.
     A4.8.3. MSGCORRN (Message Correction/Cancellation). Used by the originator to cancel a mes-
     sage or add, delete, or replace information contained in a previously transmitted message.
     A4.8.4. RI (Request for Information). Used to request information from other units.
     A4.8.5. RRI (Response to Request for Information). Used to reply to requests for information.
     A4.8.6. VISITREQ (VISIT REQuest). Used to request authorization to visit another command or
     organization for a specified purpose.

A4.9. DII COE Message Processor Software . The software is available on the Defense Information
Systems Agency (DISA), Joint Interoperability and Engineering Organization (JIEO) web page at
