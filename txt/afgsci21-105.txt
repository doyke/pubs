        1. By Order of the Commander, Air Force Global Strike Command this AFGSC
Guidance Memorandum is issued to immediately change AFGSCI 21-105, Structural
Maintenance and Corrosion Control Programs, 11 January 2012. This Guidance Memorandum
continues previously published guidance implemented under AFGSCI21-105AFGSC GM1.
Additionally, overall tiering guidance was included. The corrosion publication OPRs decided
this policy will align more appropriately with corrosion-specific Technical Orders and applicable
aircraft/missile maintenance instructions currently in revision. Therefore, AFGSCI21-
105_AFGSCGM2014-01 is required while re-writing and incorporating the corrosion policy.
Compliance with this memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its directions are inconsistent
with other Air Force publications; the information herein prevails, in accordance with AFI33-
360, Publications and Forms Management.

        2. In advance of incorporating this policy into appropriate instructions, the attachment to
this memorandum provides guidance changes that are effective immediately. Additionally,
aircraft markings that do not comply with Attachment 2 will be corrected during the next
scheduled phase inspection or periodic depot maintenance whichever inspections occurs first.

      3. This memorandum becomes void after one-year has elapsed from the date of this
memorandum, or upon publication of an Interim Change or rewrite of the affected publication,
whichever is earlier.

     markings. Standard insignias and markings will not be altered in location, dimension, or
     configuration to accommodate commander’s aircraft markings.          The following are
     markings authorized for use on commander’s aircraft:
        5.12.3.8.1. Wing and/or NAF insignias. The wing and/or NAF insignias will be
        applied on the right forward fuselage and a collage of assigned flight/operations
        squadron insignias will be applied on the left forward fuselage.
        5.12.3.8.2. Highlighting of unit designator and bomb wing designator.                All
        highlighting will be done in contrasting gray, black or white as long as it meets
        primary basecoat gloss requirements (i.e., gloss, camouflage or gunship). All unit
        designators and radio call numbers will remain on vertical stabilizers or as depicted in
        applicable technical orders.
     5.12.3.9. Nose Numbers. Aircraft tail numbers shall be in block or Helvetica letters, not
     to exceed four digits. Specific location and size for each different type aircraft is

     the same gloss requirement as the base aircraft coating.
     5.12.3.10. Bomber Combat Marking. Designated bomber aircraft with a successful
     weapons release in combat operations are authorized to display a conventional bomb
     and/or CALCM silhouette on that aircraft. These markings will be applied in contrasting
     shades that conform to the basic aircraft camouflage requirements. B-2 and B-52
     combat marking configurations are located in Attachment 2.
     5.12.3.11. Nose Art. For purposes of clarification, ―nose art‖ shall be the term used to
     identify specialized artwork applied to any area of the aircraft.            Nose art is only
     authorized on the B-52. The only exception to this policy is application of the AF
     approved ―Let’s Roll‖ nose art design. Wing Commanders may designate one aircraft
     within the wing to apply the ―Let’s Roll‖ design. The aircraft selected is at the Wing
     Commander’s discretion.          Waivers for additional aircraft will not be entertained.
     Placement of nose art is authorized on the left side of the aircraft only. Authorized nose
     art is limited to 3 feet by 3 feet in size and shall meet the following criteria:
        5.12.3.11.1. Distinctive, symbolic and designed in good taste.
