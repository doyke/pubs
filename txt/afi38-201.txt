                                         Chapter 2

                    DETERMINING MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS

2.1. Overview. By definition, a manpower requirement is the manpower needed to accomplish
a job, mission, or program. A manpower requirement can be documented as a funded manpower
authorization or an unfunded requirement. A manpower authorization is a funded manpower
position on the Unit Manpower Document (UMD). The Air Force considers manpower a
resource to support approved programs. Manpower is not a program by itself which can be
manipulated apart from the programs it supports. Manpower is a limited resource which is sized
to reflect the minimum essential level to accomplish the required workload.
2.2. General Information.
   2.2.1. Air Force active component manpower planning and programming is centralized at
   Headquarters Air Force (HAF) where national security policy is translated into force
   structure programs. Execution is decentralized to MAJCOMs where budget and resource
   allocations are translated into command programs and units. The Air Force Management
   Engineering Program (MEP) provides manpower standards to help commanders determine
   manpower requirements.
   2.2.2. Manpower requirements will only be based on MAJCOM or higher headquarters
   directives.
   2.2.3. Air Force Functional Area Managers (FAM) and/or Career Field Managers (CFM)
   will coordinate on manpower studies with AF/A1M prior to commitment of resources. This
   includes services provided by private sector contractors. For MAJCOM-level manpower
   studies, MAJCOM functional managers will coordinate with the MAJCOM A1M prior to the
   commitment of resources.
   2.2.4. Manpower study lead teams (AFPC/MA, ARF, or MAJCOM) will not release
   preliminary results, manpower estimates, or manpower requirements without AFPC/MA,
   AF/A1M, or NGB/A1M approval. This policy is to ensure integrity throughout the
   manpower community ensuring only ‘valid results’ are released to Air Force leadership.
   2.2.5. AF/A1M has approval authority for manpower standards applicable to the Active
   Component, whether applicable to multiple commands, a single command, or a single
   location; and NGB/A1M has approval authority for all manpower standards pertaining to
   ANG units.
2.3. Air Force Management Engineering Program. The MEP provides the framework for
developing Air Force manpower standards and analysis tools to systematically identify minimum
and essential manpower required to accomplish approved missions.
   2.3.1. Manpower standards are developed IAW AFMAN 38-208, Air Force Management
   Engineering Program (Volumes 1-3), which contains specific procedures, methods, tools,
   statistical requirements and formats for conducting and documenting manpower studies.
   2.3.2. As part of the MEP, the Logistics Composite Model (LCOM) is an approved Air
   Force computer simulation program used to develop aircraft maintenance manpower
   requirements (AMMR) and AETC AMMR models. Note: When an LCOM model is not
 12                                                            AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014


   available or feasible to determine aircraft maintenance manpower requirements, the
   maintenance man-hour per flying hour (MMH/FH) requirements computation can be applied.

     variance meets the minimum threshold of 25 monthly man-hours to be considered and is
     not a combination of different processes used to circumvent this threshold.
     2.4.6.13. Air Education and Training Command (AETC) Manpower and Organization
     Division (A1M) is responsible for developing all technical training requirements through
     the AETC Manpower Pricing System and Program Flying Training manpower
     determinants.
  2.4.7. MAJCOM Career Field Manager (CFM).
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                     15


     2.4.7.1. Participates in manpower standards development studies and reviews and
     provides coordination to MAJCOM manpower staff on manpower standards development
     and LCOM products.
     2.4.7.2. Partners with the MAJCOM manpower staff to identify the minimum essential
     work is captured to obtain an accurate determination of manpower requirements for the
     stated mission.
     2.4.7.3. Submits and/or coordinates on manpower change actions and other manpower
     products within their functional area of responsibility, before updating in MPES.
  2.4.8. Installation Manpower Office (MO). The installation MO advises commanders on the
  utilization and management of manpower requirements, (T-1); assists study teams with
  workload measurement, workload factor (WLF) data collection and validation of workload
  information, (T-1). Specific MO responsibilities also include: reviewing AF Forms 9, or
  other contract purchase requests, when manpower is involved, (T-1); Host-Tenant and Inter-
  service Support Agreement review, (T-1); Memorandum of Understanding review and
  analyses for manpower impact, (T-1); civilian position management, (T-1); deployment
  planning, (T-1); supporting various productivity programs, (T-1); reviewing all manpower
  action requests for local impact, (T-1); insourcing and outsourcing oversight, (T-1);
  collection/validation of WLF data when the MAJCOM manpower staff requires collection
  for application of manpower standards, (T-1); and providing Management Advisory Study
  (MAS) services for units within their area of responsibility, (T-1). The term, servicing
  Manpower Office will be used in those instances where more than one manpower-type office
  or activity resides on an installation, particularly in those instances where the MO interfaces
  with other local activities belonging to the same Wing (Civilian Personnel, Contracting,
  Financial Management (FM), etc.)
     2.4.8.1. Contract Purchase Request Manpower Review.
     2.4.8.2. Installation-level Roles and Responsibilities:
         2.4.8.2.1. Supervisors and/or commanders (Requiring Activity) will submit Contract
         Purchase Request Packages, to include funding documentation (i.e., AF Form 9, to
         include modifications and terminations), the independent government estimate, and
         the performance work statement to the installation/servicing manpower office for
         validation. (T-1).
         2.4.8.2.2. The requiring activity will also provide sufficient technical information
         (e.g., AFSC, skill-level, FAC, OSC, total contract cost and start/stop dates contract
         requirements, contract labor cost, contractor full-time staffing, or man-hour estimates,
         as may be available) to assist the installation/ servicing MO in reviewing the contract
         request. (T-1).
         2.4.8.3.1. The installation/ servicing Contracting Squadron/ Office will:
         2.4.8.3.2. Process the request for services, including modifications and contract
         extensions/ terminations, once the installation/ servicing MO has reviewed and
         validated the request. (T-1).
     2.4.8.4. Installation/ servicing Manpower Office will:
 16                                                              AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014


           2.4.8.4.1. Review and coordinate on all service-type contract requests, modifications,
           or terminations to ensure/ validate the proposed contract work is not performed or
           funded by the existing in-service workforce. (T-1). Particularly, the MO will review
           to ensure no duplication of manpower or resource expenditure will occur if the
           request is approved as it is against Air Force policy to pay ‘twice’ for workload to be
           performed; i.e., manpower which has been allocated on the unit’s UMD to perform
           workload, contractors will not be acquired to perform the same work. (T-1). The
           MO will complete their review within 5 workdays of receipt of the purchase request.
           (T-1).
2.5. The Role and Definition of the Functional Account Code (FAC). A function is a
homogeneous grouping of processes; that is, tasks requiring similar equipment/processes that are
grouped together. A function is most typically located in a centralized area and functional
personnel perform work that contributes to the same end product; typically their duties are
similar or closely related. A FAC is used to identify each function and facilitate the analysis and
accounting of its manpower requirements. A FAC title does not equate to (nor should it equate
to) an Office Symbol Code (OSC); formerly referred to as an Organizational Structure Code.
With respect to a manpower standard, a FAC indicates where the position is earned (i.e., a
particular function). For example, if positions in a function are earned by manpower standard,
the positions will have the FAC of the manpower standard. If the manpower standard has “X” in
the FAC number, the “X” is a place holder. If a function has more authorizations than were
earned, the position(s) must be deleted when the manpower standard is implemented or show
another FAC for which the position is earned. (Note: An OSC can have more than one FAC;
however, this must be kept to a minimum.) If there is no manpower standard applicable to the
function, the FAC will reflect what function the position is earned. In addition, FAC title
nomenclature will not include duty title information or organizational structure information
(e.g.,”Chief” in Chief Budget Development or “Division” in Resources Division).
   2.5.1. FACs are 6-digit codes used to identify functions. The first four digits describe the
   Air Force-level function, while the last two digits can identify command-unique functions.
   All FACs and their titles are controlled by AF/A1MR through system controls within MPES;
   the purpose being to standardize and avoid duplication of the codes and titles.
       2.5.1.1. A FAC indicates where the position is earned (i.e., a particular function) in a
       work center. In other words, when a position is earned by manpower standard in a
       particular function, the position will reflect the FAC of the manpower standard. Note: In
       the event the position is realigned to another FAC for any reason, the original FAC will
       be changed to reflect the new function; however a notation shall be made in the command
       remarks code, or local remarks code field in MPES identifying the FAC and OSC the
       position was realigned from.
   2.5.2. The first digit of the FAC represents the major groups of functions. The functional
   groups are divided into seven categories to identify the major type of work performed.
       1XXX    Command and Command Support
       2XXX    Maintenance
       3XXX    Operations
       4XXX    Mission Support
       5XXX    Medical
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                       17


       6XXX Research and Development
       7XXX Activities Outside the U.S. Air Force
   2.5.3. The functional category “8XXX” is used to identify the several missions and/or
   support activities performed by contract personnel under a single contract for operation on
   Air Force installations; because of the restrictions imposed on its use, it is not considered a
   major category.
   2.5.4. The first and second digits of a function code, when combined, represent the basic
   function of the major grouping (11XX – Information Management, 15XX – Comptroller,
   etc.). The third and fourth digits provide the additional detail to identify a specific activity
   (1110 – Administrative Communications, 1512 – Military Pay, etc.).
   2.5.5. Submit FAC requests through the respective MAJCOM A1M office to AF/A1MR
   with the recommended FAC number (if known), FAC title and the FAC definition. If
   approved, the AF/A1M Requirements Division (AF/A1MR) will update the FAC information
   in MPES.
   2.5.6. AF/A1MR establishes new FACs when warranted within an approved manpower
   standard. The FAC for the manpower standard, developed by AFPC/MA, is usually a 4-digit
   FAC, but can be a 6-digit FAC, with “XX” or “00” as the fifth and sixth digit.
2.6. Office Symbol Codes (OSC). An OSC identifies the organization structure and functional
responsibilities within a unit; for instance, ‘HO’ is the OSC for the History Office in the wing
headquarters and SE is the OSC for the Safety Office in the wing headquarters. Refer to AFI 38-
101, Air Force Organization, paragraph 4.4., for a further explanation and detail.
2.7. The Role and Application of the MAF and Overload Factor (OLF). AF/A1M is the
approval authority for all MAFs. The Air Force uses different MAFs to define and ultimately
quantify the number of full-time equivalents (FTE) a given function requires, as relevant to the
use of man-hours. Dividing the man-hours earned from the application of a manpower standard
by the appropriate MAF and overload factor results in FTEs. AFPC/MA is responsible for
developing and quantifying MAF's (e.g., Military Peacetime and Civilian) and special MAF's
(e.g., fire protection personnel work a 72-hour workweek) for functions that cross command
lines.
   2.7.1. A MAF is the average number of man-hours, per month, an assigned individual is
   available to do primary duties (direct and indirect work). The MAF calculations account for
   time away from the work center related to leave, medical care, education and training (other
   than on-the-job training), permanent change of station (PCS), organizational duties, etc. FN
   MAFs reflect host nation unique non-availability. Use AF-approved FN MAFs as
   appropriate to include special workweeks.
       2.7.1.1. Attachment 3 contains a detailed explanation of standard, wartime and special
       Air Force workweeks and/or MAFs that are used in manpower standards
       development/application.
       2.7.1.2. Commands will submit requests for new MAFs to AFPC/MA for review. Each
       request must contain detailed justification and supporting data for the new MAF and
       describe the circumstances and personnel availability policies.
 18                                                           AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014


   2.7.2. The overload factor is normally applied in conjunction with certain MAFs during the
   manpower standards application and ensures effective use of Air Force manpower
   authorizations. The overload factor realizes Air Force leadership’s expectation that some
   overtime is an effective tool instead of adding additional manpower requirements.
       2.7.2.1. Different standard workweeks have different overload factors.
          2.7.2.1.1. Use the 7.7 percent (1.077) overload factor in military work centers and
          work centers with 1 to 6 civilian positions.
          2.7.2.1.2. Use a 4.0 percent (1.04) overload factor for the extended overseas 48-hour
          workweek.
          2.7.2.1.3. Use a 1.2 percent (1.012 overload factor for the wartime sustained and
          wartime contingency 60-hour workweek.
          2.7.2.1.4. Do not apply overload factors against wartime surge, firefighter, United
          States Air Force Academy (USAFA) faculty, or FN civilian workweeks.
   2.7.3. The rounding rules for converting man-hours to manpower in the application of
   manpower standards are stated below and are depicted in the example at Attachment 4.
       2.7.3.1. For United States Direct Hire (USDH) civilians, in work centers with 1 to 6
       civilian positions, apply the OLF and round fractional manpower up to the next whole
       number.
       2.7.3.2. For military and FN civilians, round manpower results to two decimal places and
       then round any fractional manpower up to the next whole number.
2.8. Manpower Standard Application Procedures. AFPC/MA will notify the appropriate
HAF functional and manpower addressees in each command when a new manpower standard is
approved/posted (initial application); manpower standards are available for download from the
MA                                        SharePoint                                     site:
https://afma.eis.af.mil/mas/Manpower%20Standards/Forms/AllItems.aspx.
   2.8.1. Unless otherwise directed by AF/A1M, MAJCOM manpower offices/staffs will apply
   and implement new active component manpower standards (initial application) and update
   MPES within 90 days of AFMS posting on the AFPC/MA SharePoint site and reapply
   manpower standards every two-years or earlier when significant workload or mission
   changes dictate. During these reapplications, review the active component manpower
   standards for currency; apply and implement LCOM manpower studies, simulated and non-
   simulated portions, under these same criteria.
   2.8.2. When implementing a manpower standard, follow the application procedures
   contained in the manpower standard, then use Attachment 4 to calculate detailed manpower
   requirements.
   2.8.3. Manpower standard application and implementation includes applying the manpower
   standard with the most current available WLF data, per the applicable manpower standard’s
   direction, and making the resultant changes to requirements in MPES.
       2.8.3.1. Update the manpower requirements coding with the correct Manpower
       Standards Implementation (MSI) code. There are multiple MSI codes to identify how a
       requirement was determined.
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                     19


      2.8.3.2. Update MPES using the FAC associated with the manpower standard.
      2.8.3.3. Update authorized grades, using MAJCOM and Career Progression Group
      (CPG) grade factors for necessary adjustments. (Chapter 4 contains a more inclusive
      discussion of grades).
      2.8.3.4. Update other MPES data codes/attributes as required—paying particular
      attention to correctly updating the Grade, Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC), Special
      Access Requirements (SAR) and Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) codes.
   2.8.4. Unless otherwise directed by AF/A1M, MAJCOM manpower staffs will:
      2.8.4.1. Reallocate available manpower resources among their installations IAW the
      application results of the manpower standard in coordination with the respective
      MAJCOM functional representative or as directed by the MAJCOM commander.
      2.8.4.2. Implement Air Force policy for MPES time-phasing as follows:
          2.8.4.2.1. When implementation results equate to an increase or decrease in funded
          manpower authorizations, the MPES action requires an effective date of current
          quarter plus two fiscal quarters (FQ) as of the first day of the following month of the
          manpower authorization change/action. The personnel system projects a personnel
          action the following month with 6 to 9 months lead time. For example, if a
          manpower action is input to MPES during December (FYXXQ1), the effective date
          can be no earlier than 1 July (FYXXQ4) in order for the personnel system to generate
          a corresponding personnel actions; the effective date is particularly important if a
          change results in a PCS action.
          2.8.4.2.2. When implementation results equate to an increase or decrease of
          unfunded manpower requirements, the MPES action will be updated to reflect the
          action effective immediately.
   2.8.5. When implementation results exceed the current number of funded authorizations,
   each command will either (1) establish unfunded manpower requirements or (2) realign
   funded authorizations from within the command. Unfunded requirements will be updated in
   MPES, and must be reviewed every two-years to ensure the unfunded requirements remain
   valid.
   2.8.6. If the Air Force functional authority (typically the HAF 2-letter) gains approval from
   the Air Force Corporate Structure to cross-level manpower resources, AF/A1M will notify
   MAJCOM manpower staffs to apply and report the results to AF/A1M, but withhold
   implementation of the new manpower standard until further guidance is received. AF/A1M
   will process a normal inter-command transfer action in the next programming cycle. The
   AF/A1M Programming (AF/A1MP) staff will work with each command for specific
   situations.
2.9. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Manpower - Determining FMS Resource Requirements.
   2.9.1. The Arms Export Control Act, 22 USC 2751 (and following sections relating to the
   section, consistent with the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended) authorizes the sale
   of defense articles and services. The DoD Appropriation and Authorization Acts include in
   the USAF statutory end strength ceiling, manpower resources to support FMS. Although
   most FMS manpower is reimbursable, the Air Force programs the requirements to ensure
 20                                                             AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014


     coverage in the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). The HAF does not retain a “pool”
     of manpower authorizations available for new FMS programs.
     2.9.2. Preparing a Manpower Requirements Package (MRP).
        2.9.2.1. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs prepare a Manpower Requirements Package to
        justify support for an FMS case (see AFMAN 16-101, Chapter 4, para 4.6). Use
        AFMSs whenever possible; however if no AFMS applies, use alternative Air Force
        approved methods to determine requirements.
     2.9.3. Manpower Classification.
        2.9.3.1. FMS manpower authorizations are categorized as either: full-time or part-time;
        those positions performing less than 10% FMS work are not considered FMS.
     2.9.4. Use the following information to determine classification of required FMS positions:
        2.9.4.1. Full-time positions perform FMS duties 90% or more of the available time.
        2.9.4.2. Part-time positions perform both FMS and USAF workload. Part-time
        authorizations spend more than 10% (but less than 90%) of their available time
        supporting FMS.
        2.9.4.3. Use overhires for approved requirements when appropriate (surge or short term
        workload). FMS funding must be available.
     2.9.5. MPES coding of FMS Manpower. Code FMS positions under Table 2.1 as follows:
        2.9.5.1. Use Program Element Code (PEC) A2002 for full-time manpower reimbursed
        by direct case funds.
        2.9.5.2. Program the authorizations in the appropriate PEC for commands using part-
        time manpower authorizations to perform direct case workload.
        2.9.5.3. Program manpower reimbursed by administrative surcharge funds in the
        appropriate major force program using a shred of "S." Note: Only civilian and
        contractor positions (to include Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) contractors)
        can be reimbursed with Administrative Surcharge funds. Military positions in an FMS
        admin surcharge PEC are Air Force funded).

                                           Chapter 3

                            USE OF MILITARY MANPOWER

3.1. Overview. This chapter details the types of manpower used to accomplish Air Force
missions and provides the tools for determining the appropriate mix of manpower and private
sector support necessary to accomplish Air Force missions consistent with applicable laws and
policies; also known as Workforce Mix (WFM). DoD Instruction (DoDI) 1100.22, Policy and
Procedures for Determining Workforce Mix, provides additional guidance and procedures for
determining the manpower mix of each function. The table in Enclosure 3, para 1.a. of DoDI
1100.22 contains a decision matrix for determining the mix of a workforce to the function level.
Attachment 5 contains a decision matrix for determining the manpower mix to the skill of the
position.
3.2. Types of Manpower. The Air Force uses three types of manpower to perform required
work: military personnel (active duty, Air Force Reserve, individual mobilization augmentee
(IMAs), and National Guard), in-service civilian employees, and contracted services.
3.3. Use of Military Personnel. In accordance with DoD guidance, the Services assign military
personnel only to positions that:
   3.3.1. Directly contribute to the prosecution of war (combat, combat support or combat
   service support).
   3.3.2. Are military by law.
   3.3.3. Are military by custom or tradition.
   3.3.4. Are needed for overseas rotation, operational deployment augmentation, and/or career
   field sustainment.
   3.3.5. See Attachment 5 for additional determination.
3.4. Use of Non-military Personnel. For combat support or combat service support, use in-
service civilian employees or contract services. See Attachment 5 for additional determination.
3.5. Roles and Responsibilities.
   3.5.1. AF/A1M is the OPR for policy defining military essentiality and ensuring MAJCOMs
   follow DoD policies and procedures when identifying manpower positions as military
   essential.
       3.5.1.1. AF/A1M works closely with SAF/AQ to support the review of the Inventory of
       Contract Services (ICS) as required by Title 10 USC Section 2330a that is directly
       associated with Contract Full Time Equivalent (CFTE) information collection.
       3.5.1.2. AF/A1M is the OPR to oversee that CFTE information provided from the
       Enterprise-wide Contracting Manpower Reporting Application (e-CMRA), also required
       by 10 USC Section 2330a, that is entered into MPES to supplement Workforce Mix
       determinations.
   3.5.2. MAJCOM manpower staffs.
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                     23


       3.5.2.1. Follow DoD and Air Force directives on military essentiality. Create new
       military manpower positions only if the positions satisfy military-essentiality criteria.
       Use Attachment 5 to guide the decision process.
       3.5.2.2. Maintain number of authorizations by grade at or below their command grade
       levels using their grade allocation factors levied by the Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff,
       Manpower, Personnel and Services (AF/A1). The CPG factors can be used as a guide to
       maintain grade levels within their command.
   3.5.3. Installation (servicing) Manpower Office:
       3.5.3.1. Follows policies and procedures regarding military essentiality to establish new
       manpower positions, implement major mission or duty changes, or consider conversion
       of current positions. (T-1). Use Attachment 5 in the decision process. Determine
       military essentiality on the basis of the requirements of the position, or the need to
       maintain a specific capability rather than the characteristics of the incumbent. (T-1).
       3.5.3.2. Codes each manpower position in MPES for military essentiality, using the
       Inherently Governmental/Commercial Activity (IGCA) data field. (T-1).
       3.5.3.3. Coordinates all actions involving civilian manpower authorizations with the
       local servicing civilian personnel office. (T-1).
3.6. Manpower Mix. Military essentiality is the initial consideration to determine the correct
manpower mix.
   3.6.1. Military Essential Work. When current authorized civilian positions are identified as
   military essential, commands will convert the civilian authorization to military through
   attrition unless mission requirements dictate a faster conversion. Coordinate any conversion
   in functions that impact ANG forces training with the National Guard Bureau; coordinate Air
   Force Reserve conversions with AFRC.
   3.6.2. Nonmilitary Essential Work. Use in-service civilian employees or contract services to
   perform work not requiring military personnel. Note: In work centers where civilian
   authorizations have been abolished as a result of a civilian reduction in force, MAJCOMs
   may not reassign permanent or overage military personnel to perform the tasks formerly
   accomplished by reduction-in-forced in-service civilian employees. Functional managers
   may maintain the workload with the work center’s residual military including IMAs as
   specified in Chapter 9 or by realigning other civilian positions.
   3.6.3. Manpower Mix Decision Process. See Attachment 5.

                                    MILITARY GRADES

4.1. Overview. This chapter provides an overview of the military grade allocation process with
regards to ‘funded’ authorizations. Authorized (funded) military grades are established and
allocated to commands within congressionally mandated ceilings IAW Air Force policy. With
the exception of colonels and chief master sergeants, whose grades are allocated through a board
process, the Air Force allocates grades via a programming model utilizing funded authorization
‘required grades’ to determine a fair share grades distribution by command and AFS/CPG. This
chapter does not apply to general officers or the Air Reserve Component (ARC).
4.2. The Military Grade Allocation Process.
   4.2.1. As stated, military grades are established and allocated to commands in order to
   remain within congressionally mandated grade ceilings IAW Air Force policy. Grades must
   remain in balance with the funding accounts identified within the annual DoD Authorization
   Bill.
   4.2.2. Congressional ceilings constrain the number of active duty general officers, field
   grade officers and noncommissioned officers in the grades of chief master sergeant and
   senior master sergeant. The DoD Authorization Bill defines the maximum number of
   officers and enlisted authorizations.
4.3. Grade Parameters and Allocations.
   4.3.1. Military positions required to perform Air Force missions are identified by grade and
   skill using the manpower requirements determination process. The Air Force considers
   enlisted skill level, rather than grade, the primary indicator with regard to experience and/or
   effectiveness required to perform a task; therefore the accuracy of stated grade and skill level
   requirements must be maintained when implementing enlisted grade adjustments.
   4.3.2. The Air Force documents all funded and unfunded manpower requirements in MPES.
   Funded requirements contain required and authorized grades; the required grade data field in
   MPES reflects unconstrained grades/positions to accomplish a specific workload
   (constrained only by application of manpower standards or other manpower determinant).
   The authorized grades data field reflects fiscal reality and defines those grades allowed by
   applying allocated grade factors to authorized end strength.
   4.3.3. Statutory ceilings constrain the number of field grade officers (colonels, lieutenant
   colonels and majors) and senior enlisted non-commissioned officers (chief master sergeants
   and senior master sergeants). Colonel and chief master sergeant review boards are
   established to review, validate, and recommend those positions to be funded at the grade of
   colonel or chief master sergeant. Parameters for the remaining lower officer and enlisted
   grades are established through the grades allocation process which applies to lieutenant
   through lieutenant colonel and airman first class through senior master sergeant grades.
   4.3.4. In summary, Air Force military grade management is an integral process comprised of
   colonel and chief master sergeant grade reviews and officer and enlisted grade allocations.
   Although each is a separate event, they are designed to occur in sequence to ensure top down
   allocation and grade determination (i.e., colonels followed by officer allocations and chief

      4.4.10.2. Coordinate on colonel and chief master sergeant military position descriptions.
4.5. Colonel Position Management.
   4.5.1. Colonel grades are a critical resource managed within the statutory ceiling set forth by
   Title 10 United States Code, Subtitle A, Chapter 32, Section 523 (referred to as DOPMA).
   DOPMA applies to all active duty officers in Resource Identification Code (RIC) 0004,
   except for the following:
      4.5.1.1. Medical Corps and Dental Corps positions, (AFSCs: 44xx, Physician; 45xx,
      Surgery; 47xx, Dental; 40C0C, Medical Commander; 40C0D, Dental Commander and
      48xx, Aerospace Medicine).
      4.5.1.2. United States Air Force Academy permanent professors.
   4.5.2. Another special category of colonel positions are Air Force Directed Colonel Grades.
   A directed colonel grade is a command leadership position or unique staff-level position
   requiring military officer leadership in a minimum grade of colonel due to the level of
   responsibility inherent with the position. Directed colonel grades do not require review by the
   Colonel Grade Review (CGR) Board. The Directed Requirements are as follows:
      4.5.2.1. Executive Officer for the Secretary of the Air Force and Executive Officer for
      the Under Secretary of the Air Force.
      4.5.2.2. Executive Officer for the Air Force Chief of Staff and Executive Officer for the
      Air Force Vice Chief of Staff.
      4.5.2.3. Wing Commander, Wing Vice-Commander, or Group Commander position
      identified in the Manpower Programming and Execution System (MPES) with a
      organizational type code of “WG” or “GP”.
      4.5.2.4. Any funded colonel position approved by CSAF to meet the Command
      Screening Board, per AF/DPO (Colonels Group).
      4.5.2.5. Staff Judge Advocate positions in units/organizations where the Commander has
      General Courts Martial convening authority.
   4.5.3. Colonel positions residing in activities outside of the Department of the Air Force.
      4.5.3.1. No command or Air Force functional prioritization is required unless the CSAF
      directs their review.
      4.5.3.2. The CGR Board will review these positions as an entire entity versus individual
      positions unless otherwise directed by the CSAF.
      4.5.3.3. The CGR will provide an assessment and recommendation of the total number of
      colonel grades the Air Force may source to the outside activities taking into account the
      number of permanent, rotational, and nominative colonel requirements established by the
      Joint Manpower Validation Process.
30                                                            AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014


     4.5.3.4. CSAF will make the final determination as to the number of colonel grades
     allocated to the activities outside of the Department of the Air Force.
  4.5.4. DOPMA colonel positions are managed through a colonel review process consisting
  of six processes beginning with the updating of colonel requirements in MPES; providing
  duty and mission descriptions for each colonel position; command/HAF CFM prioritization;
  board preparation; convening of an Air Force Board; and AF/A1 approval and
  implementation of the Board results.
     4.5.4.1. Updating colonel requirements in MPES. AF/A1 will notify commands to begin
     updating MPES with their colonel requirements by updating the Required Grade (RQRD
     GRD) in MPES. Command A1Ms are responsible for validating all colonel requirements
     using sound manpower principles. Notify AFPC/MAMF of any pending or forecasted
     organizational changes, either activations or inactivations impacting colonel positions not
     reflected in MPES. HAF CFMs will work with their MAJCOM counterparts to advocate
     their position on where colonel requirements are needed. Unless mission dictates there
     will be no additional MPES updates impacting colonel positions (funded/unfunded) once
     commands have updated MPES with their colonel requirements and AFPC/MA has
     pulled those requirements from MPES to begin collecting duty descriptions. Any
     changes must first be approved by AF/A1MR.
     4.5.4.2. AFPC/MAMF will provide each command a data collection sheet containing all
     their colonel requirements identified in MPES. Commands will update the data
     collection sheet with the duty description, mission description, and rater information for
     each colonel position. Duty and mission descriptions will be written in very concise
     statements. Board members have limited time to read this information.
     4.5.4.3. Commands and HAF CFMs will prioritize all non-directed colonel positions.
     Each position will be given a unique prioritization value starting at “1” indicating the
     highest priority colonel position incrementally down to the lowest priority position
     known as “1-n”. There cannot be any duplicate prioritization values. The HAF CFM
     will prioritize by the three-digit Air Force Specialty (AFS). The CFM is limited to
     prioritizing the colonel requirements defined and submitted by the commands. That is
     why it is imperative for the CFM to be involved with their command counterparts at the
     beginning of the process when the commands are defining their colonel requirements. It
     is recommended, at the very least, that the positions prioritized in the top and bottom ten
     percent have rationale included of why it was prioritized as such. This aids the board
     members if/when major prioritization differences exist between the command and HAF
     CFM prioritization values.
     4.5.4.4. Board preparation. AFPC/MAMF prepares the data meeting the board working
     in conjunction with AF/A1MR and AF/DPO. AF/DPO is responsible for board member
     selection, which is close-hold. The composition may vary but will have a mix of
     MAJCOM and HAF functional representation.
     4.5.4.5. The Air Force Colonel Review Board is responsible for establishing an overall
     order-of-merit of all colonel requirements submitted by the commands. The board takes
     into account the command/HAF CFM prioritizations, CSAF vision, and any other
     applicable information provided to the board members. The board will recommend to the
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                    31


     CSAF those positions which, in the Boards opinion, warrant colonel grade funding based
     on the number of colonel grades Title 10 supports for the projected officer end strength.
     4.5.4.6. AF/DPO, along with the AF/A1M staff, forward the board results up to the
     CSAF. The AF/A1 will notify the command A1s the final results have been determined,
     followed by AFPC/MAMF release of detailed results and instructions to the command
     A1Ms. Once the final grade results are implemented by the Commands, no further
     MPES changes can be made to an authorized colonel position for two full fiscal quarters
     (6-months) from the date of the AF/A1 Implementation Memo.
  4.5.5. Until the next CGR, commands will retain and utilize the colonel grades allocated by
  the CGR process as mission dictates, adhering to the following procedure below, except for
  one condition: Colonel grades associated with mission/unit loses will be transferred to HAF
  if the command also loses the FYDP to HAF, or transfers FYDP to another command (inter-
  command transfer). Additionally, new colonel grades may be allocated to the command
  when gaining new mission(s) and/or FYDP.
  4.5.6. Post Board of colonel grade change procedures. Following the implementation
  period, any changes to the approved AF colonel grade results will be handled as “out-of-
  cycle” requests. Procedures differ depending upon the category(s) of colonel grade involved.
  Most changes will involve the non-directed category but rarely may involve the Directed
  Colonel grade category.
     4.5.6.1. Approval authority to realign a 'non-directed' colonel grade as an offset to
     another directed or non-directed colonel grade requirement, or a directed colonel grade as
     an offset to another directed colonel grade requirement, rests with the MAJCOM/CC or
     equivalent. Command A1Ms will ensure the action, to include AFS changes, is
     coordinated with the affected MAJCOM functional area manager(s). An informational
     copy of the full transaction (the Authorization Change Request and new colonel Position
     Description (AF FM 81A)) will be provided to AF/A1MR, AF/DPO & AFPC/MAMF. If
     the MAJCOM/CC or equivalent wishes to pursue the change with no offset, the
     MAJCOM will forward the package to include the request, justification, and rationale to
     AF/A1M who will staff and coordinate with the HQ functional area manager and
     AF/DPO prior to forwarding the package to the appropriate approval authority.
     4.5.6.2. Approval authority to realign a directed colonel grade as an offset to a non-
     directed colonel grade requirement rests with AF/A1M. If the MAJCOM/CC or
     equivalent wants to pursue such a change, the MAJCOM forwards the AF Form 81A, and
     a memo to include justification and rationale, to AF/A1M who will staff the package for
     approval. Note: adherence to the provisions of paragraph 4.4.9.2. is required.
     4.5.6.3. Commands will make all colonel grade changes (in MPES) effective no earlier
     than current quarter, plus two quarters, from the date updated in MPES to allow for
     personnel lead-time actions unless otherwise directed by AF/A1M.
     4.5.6.4. As a guiding principal, because colonel grades are a critical and scarce resource,
     the application of a colonel grade, serving in the capacity as Deputy, or the occasion of a
     colonel grade residing in the same work center (OSC) as a civilian General Schedule
     (GS) 15, should be rare and limited to the absolute extent possible only when/where
     mission requirements dictate.

4.6. Chief Master Sergeant Position Management.
   4.6.1. Chief master sergeant grades are a critical resource managed within the congressional
   ceiling set forth by Title 10 United States Code, Subtitle A, Chapter 31, Section 517. All
   active duty chief master sergeant positions in RIC 0104 are covered by Title 10 and managed
   by the chief master sergeant grade review process. The Chief Review process follows the
   same procedures as the Colonel Review up until the boarding process; refer to paragraphs
   4.5.4.1 through 4.5.4.4 AF/DPE replaces the roles of AF/DPO within those paragraphs.
   Command chief master sergeants and group superintendent positions are boarded separately
   from the other chief master sergeant positions as explained below.
      4.6.1.1. Command chief master sergeant and group superintendent boarding process.
      Command chief master sergeant and group superintendent positions do not require
      prioritization due to these positions being determined by specific criteria approved by the
      Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force (CMSAF). A board consisting of the CMSAF,
      AF/A1, and AF/DPE validates these positions and makes final approval using the intent
      of AFI 36-2109, Chief master sergeant of the Air Force and Command Chief master
      sergeant Programs and any additional criteria approved by the CMSAF.
      4.6.1.2. For all other chief master sergeant positions, the Air Force Chief Review Board
      is responsible for creating an overall order-of-merit of all chief master sergeant positions
      submitted by the commands. The board takes into account the command/HAF CFM
      prioritizations, CMSAF vision, and any other applicable information provided to the
      board members. The board’s recommendation to the AF/A1 of which positions to be
      funded to a chief master sergeant is based on the number of chief master sergeant grades
      Title 10 supports for the projected enlisted end strength.
   4.6.2. A directed chief master sergeant grade is a position (manpower requirement) that
   warrants the grade of chief master sergeant due to the level of responsibility inherent with the
   position. The approved directed grade list contains certain chief master sergeant positions
   which are considered to be directed, or institutional, grade requirements which do not require
   board review.
      4.6.2.1. HAF: Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, Chief of the Air Force Chief
      Master Sergeant Management Office, Chief of Enlisted Promotions and Evaluations and
      Chief of Airmen Assignments.
      4.6.2.2. MAJCOM: Chief of Enlisted Promotion and Evaluation, Commandant Senior
      Noncommissioned Officer Academy.
      4.6.2.3. Chief Master Sergeant Grade Review Implementation. No changes will be made
      to funded chief master-sergeant positions in MPES for 180 calendar days following
      receipt of the HAF message implementing the CMSgt grade results.
   4.6.3. Chief Master Sergeant Grade Change Procedures.
      4.6.3.1. Approval authority to realign a 'non-directed' chief master sergeant grade as an
      offset to another directed or non-directed chief master sergeant grade requirement, or a
      directed chief master sergeant grade as an offset to another directed chief master sergeant
      grade requirement rests with the MAJCOM/CC or equivalent. Coordinate all AFS
      changes with the affected MAJCOM functional area manager(s). An informational copy
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                     33


       of the full transaction (the Authorization Change Request and new chief master sergeant
       Position Description (AF FM 81B)) will be provided to AF/A1MR and AF/DPE. If the
       MAJCOM/CC or equivalent wishes to pursue the change with no offset, the MAJCOM
       will forward the package to include the request, justification, and rationale to AF/A1M
       who will staff and coordinate with the HQ functional area manager and AF/DPE prior to
       forwarding the package to the appropriate approval authority."
       4.6.3.2. Approval authority to realign a directed chief master sergeant grade as an offset
       to a non-directed chief master sergeant grade requirement rests with AF/A1M. If the
       MAJCOM/CC or equivalent wants to pursue such a change, the MAJCOM forwards the
       package to include the request, justification, and rationale to AF/A1M. AF/A1M will
       staff the package for approval. Note: the provisions of Paragraph 4.4.9.2 must be
       adhered to.
       4.6.3.3. Make all chief master sergeant grade changes effective no earlier than current
       plus two quarters from the date updated in MPES to allow lead time for personnel actions
       unless otherwise directed by AF/A1M.
4.7. Air Force Reserve Colonel and Chief Master Sergeant Management.
   4.7.1. Colonel and chief master sergeant Air Force Reserve Traditional Reserve positions
   (TRs) are typically determined by UTC requirement. Active Guard Reserve (AGR) colonel
   and chief master sergeant positions are determined by validating a position description
   created by the organization requesting the position. Position descriptions are validated by
   AFRC/A1M for Reserve unit AGRs, and by AF/REX for Reserve AGR positions outside of
   Air Force Reserve (at the HAF, OSD, COCOMs, etc).
   4.7.2. The total number of AGR colonel and chief master sergeant grades are controlled by
   statute as specified in Title 10 USC, Section 12012.
4.8. Officer and Enlisted Grade Allocation. The grade allocation process is designed to meet
three objectives, (1) ensure compliance with legislative and budgetary grade constraints, (2)
provide a method to equitably distribute limited grades throughout the Air Force and, (3) provide
grade targets to functional and personnel communities to more effectively manage limited
personnel resources. This method ensures grades are fairly allocated to commands across all Air
Force specialties based on established FYDP and grade ceilings; further, it ensures the number of
authorized grades reflected on unit manpower documents do not exceed allowable grade levels.
Command adjustments to ‘Required’ grades, during the command grade allocation process, shall
be IAW approved manpower determinants or standards as applicable. The following procedures
are used to allocate active duty military grades on a biennial basis:
   4.8.1. Air Force Grade Ceiling Determination.
       4.8.1.1. Colonel, lieutenant colonel and major grades are managed within congressional
       ceiling constraints set forth by United States Code (USC) Title 10, Subtitle A, Chapter
       32, Part II, Section 523. Air Force policy identifies and computes captain and lieutenant
       grades with regard to remaining end strength.
       4.8.1.2. Field grade officer ceilings are based on funded end strength, for the allocation
       years from the appropriate table in USC Title 10, Subtitle A, Chapter 32, Part II, Section
       523. Since there is no specific ceiling outlined in USC Title 10 for company grade
34                                                            AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014


     officers, captain and lieutenant grade allocations approximate the projected personnel
     inventory for the allocation years.
     4.8.1.3. Chief master sergeant and senior master sergeant grades are constrained, by law,
     to three percent of the total budgeted enlisted force end strength, of which no more than
     one percent may be allocated as chief master sergeant. Air Force policy determines the
     remaining enlisted grade ceilings (by percentage) for the remaining end strength for the
     allocation years.
  4.8.2. Exclude the following from the process:
     4.8.2.1. Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve positions.
     4.8.2.2. Active (statutory tour) Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve Positions.
     4.8.2.3. Medical Corps and Dental Corps Positions (AFSC 44xx, Physician; 45xx,
     Surgery; 47xx, Dental; 40C0C, Medical Commander; 40C0D, Dental Commander and
     48xx, Aerospace Medicine).
     4.8.2.4. Subtract student, transient and personnel holdee (patients, prisoners and
     separatees) and trainee grades from Air Force grade ceilings. AF/A1M withholds and
     does not allocate non-permanent party students (data provided by A1MP), transients and
     personnel holdees to the commands. AFPC/MA provides historical data for withheld
     grades.
  4.8.3. Exclude the following grades from the fair share process:
     4.8.3.1. General Officer positions. General officer grades are determined by a separate
     process.
     4.8.3.2. Colonel positions and chief master sergeant grades are determined through
     separate processes.
  4.8.4. Subtract fixed grades, approved and provided by AF/A1M, from the total grades
  available; these fixed grades are not part of the fair sharing piece of the grades allocation
  process, but are added back in after fair sharing is completed to determine the command
  grade and AFS factors (AFS factors will be referred to as CPG factors throughout the grades
  allocation process). The following categories are fixed at the authorized grade in MPES:
     4.8.4.1. Outside the Air Force positions are requirements coded as Air Force FAC 7XXX
     in MPES, excluding PEC 00091519X, 000A2002X, or 000A1009A. These requirements
     are identified with activities the Air Force does not control but are jointly manned with
     sister services and/or by foreign governments, and the United States, to include HQ
     Combatant Commands and Joint HQs activities of other military departments and U.S.
     Government agencies outside DoD. (Note: in the above example X equals any value.)
     4.8.4.2. Reimbursable positions are requirements coded as PEC 00091519X,
     000A2002X, or 000A1009A. These positions are assigned to U.S. Government agencies
     outside the DoD (for example, OSD support) or support the Foreign Military Sales
     program. No dollars are generated through the Air Force programming process for
     reimbursable positions; reimbursable positions are reimbursed from the host agency but
     are chargeable to the Air Force FYDP and grade ceilings. (Note: again, in the above
     example X equals any value.)
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                     35


      4.8.4.3. Miscellaneous fixed positions are functions or units with unique mission
      requirements approved and identified by AF/A1MR, per letter, prior to each allocation
      process (e.g. Special Duty, Band, certain USAFA positions, SNCO Academy instructors,
      USAFA group and squadron commander and support commander positions, etc.).
   4.8.5. A grades allocation module of MPES is used to compute and allocate grades fairly
   across commands and AFS (CPGs).
   4.8.6. Grade Factor Allocation to the MAJCOMs. AF/A1M approves and provides
   command grade and AFS factors derived from the sum of fixed and fair share grades for all
   officer and enlisted positions. Grades are allocated as factors (or percentages) to be applied
   to each command’s FYDP. Two types of factors are developed and distributed:
      4.8.6.1. Command grade factors: Command compliance with command grade factors is
      mandatory, factors are provided to allow for grade adjustments as command resources
      may fluctuate. Commands must implement the command grade factors to determine the
      overall command grade allowances for each grade; these established grade allowances
      will prevent commands from exceeding their fair share distribution of grades.
      4.8.6.2. AFS (CPG) grade factors:        Commands are accorded flexibility when
      implementing AFS grade factors. These factors serve as a fair share guide for manpower
      and functional personnel; Commands may redistribute grades by AFS as needed to meet
      mission requirements, but must remain within the commands overall grade allowances
      per grade as determined by implementing the command grade factors.
4.9. Command Grades Allocation Implementation and Maintenance.
   4.9.1. Commands are given two grade factors: 1) Command Grade Factors (mandatory) and
   2) Command AFS (CPG) Factors (guideline).
   4.9.2. For enlisted positions, determine mandatory command grade allowances for each
   grade by applying the mandatory command grade factors to the command’s FYDP as such:
      4.9.2.1. Subtract UMD authorized chief master sergeant grades from the FYDP results in
      an “adjusted FYDP.” (Note: recommend using a dated UMD snapshot that is easily
      replicated).
      4.9.2.2. Multiply the “adjusted FYDP” by each individual grade “command grade factor”
      (Note: all fixed grades are included in the FYDP); this will result in a “mandatory
      command grade allowances” for each grade.
   4.9.3. Enlisted AFS/CPG grade allowances for each grade are determined by applying the
   AFS/CPG grade factor to the AFS/CPG “authorized grade” total as outlined below. (Note:
   authorized grade totals include all fixed grades; results are used only as a guide).
      4.9.3.1. Subtract all chief master sergeant “authorized grades” from each AFS/CPG’s
      authorized grade total (Note: recommend using dated UMD snapshot easily replicated).
      4.9.3.2. Multiply “total authorized grades” for that AFS/CPG by each grade’s AFS/CPG
      factor within the AFS/CPG.
      4.9.3.3. The result(s) will be the AFS/CPG grade allowance for each grade in that
      AFS/CPG (Note: repeat for all remaining AFS/CPGs in the command).
 36                                                          AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014


      4.9.3.4. Sum the results for all AFS/CPG grade allowances for each grade and compare
      the AFS/CPG grade allowances to mandatory command grade allowances as referenced
      in paragraph 4.9.2
      4.9.3.5. The results of that comparison will show if a command is under or over allocated
      in any particular grade IAW the mandatory command grade allowances.
      4.9.3.6. An over allocation in any grade dictates the command must take action to
      comply with mandatory command grade allowances.
      4.9.3.7. Commands have the flexibility to redistribute grades among AFS/CPGs during
      this process but must remain in compliance with the mandatory command grade
      allowances. (Note: “fixed” or authorized grades, cannot be adjusted.)
   4.9.4. For officer positions, determine mandatory command grade allowances for each grade
   by applying the mandatory command grade factors to the command’s FYDP as such:
      4.9.4.1. Subtract authorized Generals, Colonels and Medical Corps/Dental Corps
      (MC/DC) grades from the FYDP command’s FYDP results in an “adjusted FYDP”
      (Note: recommend using a historical (dated) UMD snapshot that can be replicated).
      4.9.4.2. Multiply the “Adjusted FYDP” by each individual “command grade factor”
      (Note: all fixed grades are included in the FYDP); the results are the “mandatory
      command grade allowances” for each grade.
   4.9.5. Officer AFS/CPG grade allowances for each grade are determined by applying the
   AFS/CPG grade factor to the AFS/CPG “authorized grade” total as outlined below. (Note:
   authorized grade totals include all fixed grades; results are used only as a guide).
      4.9.5.1. Subtract authorized general, colonel and MC/DC officer grades from the
      authorized grade total. (Note: recommend using a historical (dated) UMD snapshot that
      can be replicated.)
      4.9.5.2. Multiply “total authorized grades” for that AFS/CPG by each grade’s AFS/CPG
      factor within the AFS/CPG.
      4.9.5.3. The result(s) will be the AFS/CPG grade allowance for each grade in that
      AFS/CPG (Note: repeat for all remaining AFS/CPGs in the command).
      4.9.5.4. Sum the results for all AFS/CPG grade allowances for each grade and compare
      the AFS/CPG grade allowances to mandatory command grade allowances as referenced
      in paragraph 4.9.4.
      4.9.5.5. The results of the comparison will show if a command is under or over allocated
      in any particular grade IAW the mandatory command grade allowances.
      4.9.5.6. An over allocation in any grade dictates the command must take action to
      comply with mandatory command grade allowances.
      4.9.5.7. Commands have the flexibility to redistribute grades among AFS/CPGs during
      this process but must remain in compliance with the mandatory command grade
      allowances. (Note: “fixed” or authorized grades, cannot be adjusted.)
4.10. Grade Terminology/Definitions.
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                    37


  4.10.1. Fixed Grades: Fixed grade categories are grades funded at 100 percent to the UMD
  authorized grade. These grades are subtracted from the grades baseline during the fair
  sharing process. However, they are added back into the fair share grades and are included in
  the final command and CPG grade factor determination.
  4.10.2. Student, Transient, Personnel Holdee and Trainee Account. The STP holdee account
  is used by Air Force budget programmers to determine the number of authorizations to
  allocate for the total number of military personnel who are not available for duty and not
  authorized on the UMD. STP category accounts include:
     4.10.2.1. Trainees: Enlisted trainees and officer accession students include those active
     duty enlisted and officer military personnel who have not completed initial entry training.
     4.10.2.2. Students: Military trainees in PCS status of 20 weeks or greater (excludes
     upgrade training and flying training).
     4.10.2.3. Holdees: Active duty military member dropped from assigned strength of a
     force structure unit and attached to a holding activity for medical, disciplinary, or pre-
     separation non-availability.
     4.10.2.4. Patients: Active duty military members reassigned to a medical facility when
     hospitalization has exceeded or is expected to exceed 90 days.
     4.10.2.5. Prisoners: Active duty military members convicted by civil or military court
     and sentenced to confinement for 30 days or more.
     4.10.2.6. Transients: Active duty military members who have left their unit when
     executing a PCS move. This covers only the time for leave and travel.
     4.10.2.7. Colonels and chief master sergeants that are in a STP status are included as part
     of the DOPMA ceiling. Since this value fluctuates on a monthly basis, a value is used
     based off a factor developed over 36 months historic data.
  4.10.3. Fenced: Colonel and Chief master sergeant positions, identified by the AF/A1M,
  that will be exempt from the Colonel and Chief master sergeant Reviews.

                          CIVILIAN POSITION MANAGEMENT

5.1. Overview. The Air Force is committed to managing civilian manpower authorizations
within Congressional and budgetary constraints while also balancing mission needs with
economy and efficiency of operations. The policy directives that govern appropriated civilian
resource management, position management and classification are AFPD 36-5, Civilian
Personnel Resource Management and AFPD 36-14, Position Management and Classification.
The primary controlling factors in managing civilian resources are the validation of the civilian
manpower requirement (permanent and temporary) by the servicing manpower office, the
availability of manpower authorizations, work years and financial resources.
5.2. Roles and Responsibilities.
   5.2.1. Supervisors and/or commanders. Submit temporary or term requests, and new or
   revised civilian position description documents, to the servicing manpower office for
   coordination using a locally-devised Authorization Change Request (ACR) or other
   transmittal document. (T-1).
       5.2.1.1. Once the proposed action is validated and approved, the MO will return the
       action to the originator who will attach it to the Request for Personnel Action (RPA) for
       transmittal to the servicing civilian personnel activity. (T-1).
       5.2.1.2. The servicing civilian personnel activity will then provide the MO office a copy
       of the approved/classified civilian position to ensure the grade is consistent with the
       duties described in the position description, as well as the location of the position within
       the unit and its responsibilities as contained in the position description. After the
       approved/classified position description is returned, an ACR will be accomplished to
       update the required grade. (T-1).
   5.2.2. Installation/Servicing Manpower Office.
       5.2.2.1. Coordinates with the servicing civilian personnel activity on ACR and
       organizational change requests (OCR) impacting civilian positions. (T-1).
       5.2.2.2. Ensures all ACRs use ‘To Be Determined’ (TBD) for the authorized and
       required grades (pay band), for the Civilian position description (CPD), and four zeros
       “0000” for the occupational series (OCC Code) for civilian positions that do not yet have
       a final classification determination. (T-1). Final classification determination is defined
       as the official classification of the position by the servicing civilian personnel activity.
       (T-1). For civilian positions receiving a final classification determination, an electronic
       PDF copy of the final classification determination shall be attached to the ACR to
       document the completed action. (T-1).
       5.2.2.3. With regard to the authorized civilian grades, occupational series, and civilian
       personnel documents (PD), these will be updated directly into MPES via the authoritative
       source, DCPDS. (T-1). The process for these three fields will occur on a weekly basis to
       reduce processing times and eliminate unnecessary errors in MPES. (T-1).
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                      39


     5.2.2.4. Coordinates on all new or revised permanent (i.e., non-temporary, non-term)
     civilian position descriptions, (T-1); and validates that the proposed civilian positions are
     assigned against valid UMD positions. (T-1). The installation MO will also review to
     ensure the approved organizational structure is maintained. (T-1).
     5.2.2.5. Reviews civilian position description documents to ensure the duties are
     consistent with the work center requirement and validates that the duties described in the
     position description are consistent with the AFSC and skill level allowed by existing
     manpower standards or by the position supervisor when a manpower standard is not
     available. (T-1). The MO certifies the position description, or Core Doc, does not
     include duplicate duties nor duties/responsibilities of any other position, or workload
     contained in existing contracts, regardless the type or funding source. (T-1). Duty
     descriptions and codes in Air Force Officer Classification Directory (AFOCD) and Air
     Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD), found on the AFPC/MA website, are
     broad indicators of duties and responsibilities and serve as valuable references on the
     type experience and/or level of civilian skills required. (T-1). The above is critical to
     ensuring the integrity of the unit manpower document which is an installation manpower
     office responsibility. (T-1)
     5.2.2.6. Reviews the unit’s UMD, organizational charts and any other pertinent
     documentation to affirm the duties of the civilian position are consistent with the work
     described in the position description and that it is appropriate for the work center. (T-1).
     An interview with the supervisor of the position, to ensure the duties are correct/valid,
     may be appropriate if there is some question as to the duties attributed to the position and
     the intended grade, or other unintended consequences such as impacting another position
     or adversely affecting the supervisor to subordinate ratio. (T-1). The Office of Personal
     Management’s (OPM) General Schedule Supervisory Guide (GSSG) states that
     supervisory work must constitute a major duty occupying at least 25 percent of the
     position's time. Note: some other factors to take into consideration would be the amount
     of time spent supervising, the complexity of the work of the organization, the type and
     grade level of the employees supervised, how the employees perform their work, whether
     fully administrative and/or technical duties are performed, etc. (T-1).
        5.2.2.6.1. Reviews the action to ensure span of control and layering principals
        (complexity of mission, similarity to similar organizational units, level of supervision
        required by subordinate units, degree of coordination required among subordinates,
        physical distance between subordinates and supervisor and organization structure) are
        acceptable; i.e., that no duplication or layering of supervision will occur within the
        organization as a result of the action, (T-1); and that new or revised duties and
        responsibilities do not replicate existing supervisory positions. (T-1). Established
        supervisory positions include military or civilian personnel.
        5.2.2.6.2. Identifies unnecessary deputy or assistant positions and/or duties; co-equal
        managerial positions or duplication of supervisory duties at any level are not
        permitted, whether performed by two or more military, civilian, or a combination of
        the two. (T-1). MAJCOM/A1Ms, or equivalent, will approve deputy and assistant
        positions only when determined to be essential for span of control; the military or
        civilian head of the organization is frequently absent due to official duties (and no
        other subordinate can serve in an acting capacity; or other valid mission necessity.

     5.2.2.7. Reviews and validates the requirement for a civilian overhire. (T-1). Civilian
     overhires are typically characterized as a short-term, seasonal or cyclical, workload
     requirement of less than one year’s duration. (T-1). Term overhires may be engaged for
     non-permanent work up for a period up to 4-years for competitive service and up to 5-
     years for excepted service. (T-1). Work load that is projected to last more than 4 years
     for competitive service and more than 5-years for excepted service is considered to be
     permanent and a funded position must be obtained to support it. (T-1). It is
     recommended that Overhires not be retained for workload beyond 4-years for
     competitive service and beyond 5-years for excepted service (some exceptions are
     positions involving hazardous material and/or environmental cleanup, base closures, etc.)
     (T-1).
         5.2.2.7.1. Overhires will not be validated and/or approved to replace, or compensate
         for unfunded manpower requirements on the UMD for long periods of time. (T-1).
         In instances as this the installation MO will explore other options to include
         realigning a lower priority funded manpower authorization from elsewhere on the
         installation to permanently resolve the situation, or obtain MAJCOM permission to
         pursue a local additive to the manpower standard. (T-1). The MO must be careful to
         fully justify the proposed option/resolution to the Wing Commander, Group
         Commander, or other senior decision making official. (T-1).
         5.2.2.7.2. Overhires are subject to: MO workload validation; funding validation by
         the servicing resource management authority and recruitment of positions approved
         by the servicing civilian personnel activity or other similar activity/authority. (T-1).
     5.2.2.8. The Installation MO Officer, or Chief, serves as an advisor to the Installation
     Civilian Employment Cost Management Committee (CECMC) or like board, to assist
     with manpower related resource issues/questions. (T-1).
     5.2.2.9. Submits project work file information to the MAJCOM, or builds project work
     files in MPES to update the occupational series (OCC code) and grade (pay band) upon
     receipt of the final classification determination from the servicing civilian personnel
     activity. (T-1).
  5.2.3. Servicing Civilian Personnel Activity.
     5.2.3.1. Ensures requests for personnel action that change or establish position
     descriptions have first been routed through, and coordinated/validated by, the installation
     MO prior to taking any classification action; this is to ensure the RPA is consistent with
     the intent of the position(s) on the UMD. (T-1).
     5.2.3.2. Ensures over hire requests are first coordinated with the servicing MO per
     paragraph 5.2.2.4 (T-1).

             MANPOWER ESTIMATE REPORT (MER) REQUIREMENTS

6.1. Overview. The MER, also known as a Manpower Estimate by OSD, satisfies the
congressional requirement to submit major acquisition program manpower requirements to the
Office of the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF). The SECDEF reviews the manpower
requirements report prior to approving full-scale engineering development or production and
deployment. Attachment 8 is an example of the required format for the MER.
6.2. General Information.
   6.2.1. MERs are required by Title 10 United States Code, Section 2434. DoDI 5000.2,
   Operation of the Defense Acquisition System, directs the development/completion of a MER
   at several milestones including full operational deployment (FOD) of defense systems.
   6.2.2. The MER is the source document for determining the manpower requirements portion
   of the “total costs of ownership” for acquisition systems required by DoDD 5000.1, The
   Defense Acquisition System, Section E1.4. In addition, it is the only OSD-level acquisition
   document that addresses manpower affordability from a military and DoD civilian end
   strength perspective, as well as contractor FTE perspective and is the only required
   acquisition document that addresses skill shortages.
   6.2.3. A MER is an authoritative source document for projected out-year military, civilian
   and contract support manpower required for the acquisition and/or upgrade of a weapon
   system, support and automated information systems; or the concurrent transfer of systems
   from the Active to Reserve Component and retirement of systems from the inventory. They
   are used to develop strategic forecasts of the defense workforce and assist with strategic
   planning. A MER will be developed for all manpower-intensive programs (e.g., programs
   with high personnel or critical skill requirements) regardless of acquisition category and
   consistent with the DoD component’s manpower policies.
   6.2.4. Manpower authorities (may be at HAF or at MAJCOM-level) assess whether the
   estimates are comprehensive and accurate; there are sufficient resources (i.e., military,
   civilian and contract services) to support the program; there will be adequately trained
   personnel to operate, maintain and support the system; congressional “controls” (floors and
   ceilings) and administrative restrictions on special programs (such as resources “fenced” for
   the National Intelligence Programs) have been observed; and lastly that manpower and
   personnel objectives and/or thresholds in the capabilities documents have been met.
   6.2.5. The MER further outlines the official Air Force manpower position and addresses
   whether the system is affordable from a military end strength, DoD civilian end strength and
   contractor FTE stand-point. In addition, the manpower assessment ensures that MERs are
   based on the level of performance most likely to be achieved and recommends post-fielding
   verification of high-risk factors used for the estimate. At later milestone decisions, the MER
   reflects results of developmental tests, as available.
   6.2.6. The MER also summarizes key personnel decisions or assumptions that have a
   significant effect on manpower (e.g., plans for developing new, or restructuring existing
   career fields). It addresses whether there are any hard-to-fill occupations, personnel
 42                                                            AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014


   inventory shortfalls, or other personnel concerns that could adversely impact full operational
   deployment or sustainment of the system. When appropriate, the MER summarizes the
   knowledge, skills and abilities required by the operators, maintainers, trainers and support
   personnel and discusses any significant differences or shortfalls from the current and
   projected inventory.
   6.2.7. The manpower authority for the lead DoD component for joint programs is
   responsible for obtaining approval of the MER from all DoD component manpower
   authorities participating in the program.
   6.2.8. A draft MER should be approved for release at least 3 to 6 months in advance of the
   Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) milestone review so that the manpower can be used for
   development of cost estimates and affordability assessments. The final MER is submitted to
   the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness ) [OUSD(P&R)] in
   sufficient time to support the Overarching Integrated Product Team (OIPT) review in
   preparation for the DAB. Normally, the MER is sent 3 weeks prior to the OIPT review.
   6.2.9. The content of the MER is approved by the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for
   Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR) or designee and tailored to fit the program under
   review. For example, manpower for system-specific training is generally included in the
   estimate, while manpower for basic training is usually excluded. A MER is required at
   Milestones B, C and full-rate production. It will be updated at each of these milestones
   consistent with changes in other program documentation. Where possible, the estimate will
   reference rather than duplicate information in other acquisition program documentation.
6.3. Manpower Estimating Considerations.
   6.3.1. Estimating Methodologies.
      6.3.1.1. The MER briefly describes methodologies used to estimate the manpower for
      each type unit and organization and states whether the Air Force manpower authority, or
      designee, has validated the methodologies. It identifies key factors and assumptions used
      to estimate the manpower (e.g., maintenance ratios, equipment usage rates, crew ratios,
      aircrew instructor positions, course development and fielding schedule) and states
      whether they were provided by the program manager, based on comparable contemporary
      systems, or reflect test results.
      6.3.1.2. Reengineering initiatives and studies, approved plans for base closures,
      restructuring initiatives, OMB Circular A-76 competitions, in-sourcings, direct
      conversions, or other initiatives that significantly affect the quantity or workforce mix of
      military and civilian manpower and contract support must be addressed.
      6.3.1.3. The source of support for all new and modified systems, regardless of
      acquisition category, is based on the Manpower Mix Criteria and Guidance for Risk
      Assessments. Risk mitigation takes precedence over cost savings in high-risk situations
      or when there are intelligence or security concerns.
   6.3.2. Affordability. System affordability represents the degree to which the life-cycle cost
   of an acquisition program is consistent with the long-range investment and force structure
   plans of the Department and addresses the following points:
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                     43


     6.3.2.1. New, Displaced and Replaced Equipment. If systems are retired from the
     inventory or move from active to the ARC to support fielding of the new system, the
     MER must identify the replaced systems, affected units or platforms and the replacement
     rates (e.g., two-for-one replacement), by fiscal year.
     6.3.2.2. Manpower Requirements and Contract Support. The MER must compare
     manpower requirements for the new system with those required for the replaced systems
     (i.e., systems retired or transferred) and describe increases or decreases in military or
     DoD civilian end strength and contractor civilian manpower requirements. Increases or
     reductions in CFTEs must also be reported. The cause for increases or decreases (e.g.,
     equipment replacement rates; reduced force structure; reduced levels of maintenance;
     changes in operating tempos, maintenance ratios, crew ratios; or training throughput
     course changes) must be reported if significant to the program. If manpower for the new
     system is significantly higher or lower than what was required by the replaced system,
     manpower officials will also assess whether manpower providing indirect support, such
     as base operating support (BOS) and operational medical and mess, will increase or
     decrease and report any significant changes. (T-1).
     6.3.2.3. Manpower Authorizations. The estimate must address resource shortfalls and
     state whether any increases in military or civilian authorizations, beyond what is included
     in the FYDP, or waivers to existing manpower constraints, will be required to achieve the
     resource levels reported in the estimate. Major resource shortfalls are identified as risks
     in the MER and reported to the program manager for inclusion in the acquisition strategy.
     6.3.2.4. Staffing.    In addition to reporting the manpower requirements and
     authorizations, assurances are needed that skilled personnel required to operate, maintain,
     train and support the system will be available upon fielding. Manpower might be
     required and authorized but the positions are not filled due to career field manning
     recruitment, retention, training, or other personnel issues; this can seriously impact the
     future success of the acquisition. The MER addresses whether there are any hard-to-fill
     positions, personnel shortfalls, or other issues that could adversely affect fielding. Major
     personnel shortfalls must be identified as risks in the MER and acquisition strategy.
  6.3.3. Risk Assessment. At full-rate production, manpower authorities will recommend
  post-fielding verification of high-risk factors.
     6.3.3.1. The MER clearly states whether the manpower requirements reported in the
     estimate are subject to change.
        6.3.3.1.1. The MER states whether any of the factors or assumptions used to estimate
        the manpower are significantly different from what is used to determine manpower
        requirements for comparable contemporary systems and whether the differences are
        significant enough to represent a risk to the validity of the manpower estimate. When
        significant manpower reductions or changes in skill sets are expected as a result of
        technology insertion and/or doctrine and policy changes, the MER addresses the risk
        of achieving these reductions or changes commensurate with the developmental and
        programmatic risk of the technology and/or doctrine and policy changes. Estimates
        for systems under spiral or block development must indicate whether post-fielding
        verification of the manpower for the initial systems confirmed or invalidated the
        MER. The estimate must also address whether the maintenance, support, or training
 44                                                              AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014


          concepts represent a significant enough departure from those of comparable
          contemporary systems to warrant post-fielding verification of the manpower.
          6.3.3.1.2. The MER indicates whether approved restructuring initiatives (e.g.,
          reorganizations, functional realignments, streamlining, or reengineering efforts) have
          been completed for OMB Circular A-76 competitions, personnel initiatives (e.g.,
          consolidation of military or civilian career fields), or other actions that could affect
          the manpower or provide for more efficient and effective processes as required by
          DoDI 5000.2, Section 3.7.2.1.
      6.3.3.2. When engineering designs increase individual workloads or task complexities,
      the impact on human performance and risk of cognitive or physical overload must be
      evaluated. The MER identifies whether there is a risk that operators, maintainers, or
      support personnel may not have the skills or abilities to perform the required
      duties/mission.
      6.3.3.3. Major manpower resource or personnel shortfalls must be identified as risks in
      the MER and acquisition strategy. The MER also states whether the new system meets or
      exceeds manpower and personnel constraints (objectives and thresholds) in the Capability
      Development Document and key performance parameters in the Acquisition Program
      Baseline.
6.4. Manpower Estimate Report Preparation. AF/A1MR prepares a Staff Summary Sheet
(SSS) and a memo for AF/A1M signature. The lead command prepares all remaining items.
   6.4.1. Staff Summary Sheet. AF/A1MR coordinates the MER throughout the HAF and
   Secretariat. The staff summary sheet lists the commands responsible for developing the
   MER and gives a brief statement of requirements, offsets and shortfalls.
   6.4.2. Cover memorandum from AF/A1M to OUSD (P&R). This memorandum transmits
   the Air Force report to OSD for entry into the acquisition process.
      6.4.2.1. This memorandum briefly identifies the program and milestone under review,
      resource shortfalls, personnel issues and the effect the program will have on the Air Force
      manpower structure. It indicates whether increases in military or civilian manpower are
      above programmed levels or waivers to existing manpower constraints/restrictions are
      required to support the program.
      6.4.2.2. The cover memorandum states program risks and whether manpower constraints
      (objectives and thresholds) and key performance parameters for manpower are met or
      exceeded.
   6.4.3. The MER consists of the following elements:
      6.4.3.1. The first paragraph cites the pending milestone decision and the legal mandate
      for the report. If the Air Force is the lead service for a multi-service report, reference the
      location of the other service reports within the Air Force input. The second paragraph
      summarizes the program, gives the FOD manpower requirements and states the timing
      and size of any manpower shortfalls. Use a third paragraph, if needed, to describe the
      impact of any manpower shortfall on fielding the system.
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                   45


     6.4.3.2. Program Synopsis. This provides decision makers a program summary that
     describes the system, shows deployment schedules and explains the operations,
     maintenance and training concepts for the system.
     6.4.3.3. Manpower Requirements Methodology and Rationale.             This illustrates
     manpower requirements for operations, maintenance, support and training by component
     and/or command. Identify each component’s and/or command’s requirement by category
     and the methodology used to estimate requirements as appropriate.
     6.4.3.4. Component Requirements Detail. For each component, prepare a separate
     display of the manpower required for the new system. This shows basic functions used to
     build requirements, parallels information in paragraph 6.4.3.3 and projects the
     requirements by year from initial production to retirement of the weapon system. This is
     generally for 20 years past FOD and a five-year retirement schedule.
     6.4.3.5. Manpower Impacts by Component. Required by OSD Personnel and Readiness
     (OSD P & R), this piece of the MER summarizes offsets and shortfalls, and will cover the
     same time period as paragraph 6.4.3.4 and provide the best available data. If offsets and
     shortfalls are undefined or undecided, provide a paragraph listing the reasons why
     offsets/shortfalls are undefined and/or undecided and a projected date they will be
     available. Group the data by components and divide each group into Requirements,
     Offsets and Shortfalls, broken out by Officers, Enlisted, Civilians and Contractors.
     Lastly, provide a summary of the total Air Force requirements, offsets and shortfalls.
     6.4.3.6. Statement of Manpower Requirements. This covers all years beginning with
     initial fielding and ending with retirement and disposal of the system, to include
     environmental cleanup and includes five groupings (Operations, Maintenance, Support,
     Training and Total).
     6.4.3.7. The Maintenance grouping includes organizational and intermediate
     maintenance. Under Support Grouping include depot maintenance, central logistics
     support, program office, Air Force plant representative office, contract administrative
     support and associated BOS manpower for each element. Under Operations Grouping
     include Aircrew Instructors and other operations student support (e.g.,
     Standardization/Evaluation, Liaison, Life Support). Under Training Grouping include
     course development requirements.
     6.4.3.8. Each grouping will include a breakout reflecting active officer, active enlisted,
     civilian (U.S. and FN), Air Force Reserve and ANG technicians, drill officers, drill
     enlisted, AGR officer, AGR enlisted, contractors and the overall total. If technician
     and/or contractor requirements are part of the program, include a man-year total, which is
     a total of all categories and a manpower total which excludes the contractors and
     technicians. Any manpower shortfall will be identified/programmed as ‘organic’
     resources when required skills are not available.
  6.4.4. Periodic updates of the MER will follow same procedures. AF/A1 and lead command
  will identify known changes to initial concepts when tasked.

                                           Chapter 7

                   ACTIVE GUARD AND RESERVE REQUIREMENTS

7.1. Overview. Commands establish AGR authorizations for members of the ANG or AFRC.
These authorizations are filled by personnel voluntarily serving on extended active duty or active
duty (other than training) for a specified period of time, usually over 360 days. Department of
Defense Instruction 1205.18, Full-Time Support (FTS) to the Reserve Components, is the
governing directive listing duties and responsibilities of FTS to the Reserve components.
7.2. Roles and Responsibilities.
   7.2.1. Congress and OSD establish ceilings/limitations on management headquarters
   activities and Air Force personnel end strengths. Programs utilizing AGR authorizations are
   subject to the usual budgetary review scrutiny just as any other Air Force program IAW Title
   10 and Title 32 United States Code.
   7.2.2. Command-established AGR authorizations.
       7.2.2.1. Include duties that support the applicable section of Title 10 United States Code,
       Armed Forces, AFPD 36-21, Utilization and Classification of Air Force Military
       Personnel and AFI 36-2116, Extended Active Duty for Reserve Component Officers.
       7.2.2.2. Include duties not routinely assigned to, or not the responsibility of, the active
       force.
   7.2.3. The Director of the ANG (NGB/CF) and the Chief of the Air Force Reserve (AF/RE)
   validate all AGR authorizations not specifically established in law, ensure position currency
   and approve establishment/change to AGR positions (as delegated by Deputy Assistant
   Secretary of the Air Force, Reserve Affairs (SAF/MRR)).
   7.2.4. Title 10 United States Code, Sections 12011 and 12012 limit the grades for AGR field
   grade officer and senior enlisted authorizations.
   7.2.5. Document all AGR authorizations in MPES with the appropriate RIC and functional
   category.
7.3. Procedures to Change or Request New Authorizations.
   7.3.1. A single request may include more than one similar type position. All requests must
   identify the total number of authorizations required and follow the instructions in
   Attachment 5 to determine the appropriate manpower work force mix. AGR resources are
   extremely limited. Requests for new authorizations will include potential sourcing options.
   The requesting unit organizational commander, or chief, shall include a cover letter stating
   the overall intent of the position. (T-1). Follow the instructions in Attachment 6 for AGR
   position requests.
   7.3.2. NGB/CF and AF/RE will review the requests for need, compliance, allocation use and
   impact on congressional, OSD and budget limits. NGB/CF and AF/RE approve validated
   requests.
   7.3.3. NGB/CF and AF/RE send copies of the validation, funding decision and supporting
   documentation to the requesting manpower activity.
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                            47


  7.3.4. HQ AFRC/A1M maintains AGR authorizations within approved end strength and
  grade ceilings for the AFRC AGR unit program. AGR unit requirements and authorizations
  supporting Air Force approved programs do not need to be forwarded to AF/RE.
 48                                                           AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014


                                         Chapter 8

  GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR ANG AND RESERVE COMPONENT MANPOWER

8.1. Roles and Responsibilities.
   8.1.1. AF/A1M.
       8.1.1.1. Arbitrates manpower requirement disagreements between gaining/losing
       commands and the ARC.
       8.1.1.2. Monitors the MPES manpower database to make sure the data complies with
       policies and procedures.
   8.1.2. Gaining Command. The Gaining command is responsible for:
       8.1.2.1. Setting mobilization manpower requirements for gained units in coordination
       with the Joint Force Provider Component and IAW paragraph 8.2.2
       8.1.2.2. Developing mobilization manpower requirements for ARC units and provides
       manpower requirements to HQ AFRC/A1M, or Headquarters National Guard Bureau
       Manpower, Organization and Resources Division (NGB/A1M).
       8.1.2.3. Informing NGB or HQ AFRC of specified manpower requirement changes
       needed before making them in MPES. Clearly explain the rationale for the change.
       8.1.2.4. Forwarding any unresolved disagreements to AF/A1M for resolution, and
       providing a summary of the differences and recommendations to NGB/A1M, AF/REX
       and HQ AFRC/A1M.
   8.1.3. AFRC and ANG/A1M.
       8.1.3.1. AFRC and ANG will ensure the appropriate gaining command is identified in
       MPES for all ARC manpower requirements.
       8.1.3.2. Establish manpower requirements needed for in-place mobilization and for
       managing, supporting and training units in a non-mobilized status when the gaining
       command does not provide this support. Incorporate these authorizations with the
       gaining command’s mobilization manpower requirements and send the consolidated data
       to HAF, the gaining MAJCOM, MA and the respective reserve units.
       8.1.3.3. Monitor unit programming actions to ensure unit designations are valid and
       personnel accounting symbol (PAS) codes are available. Confirm and communicate unit
       designation and PAS codes to gaining commands as soon as they complete programming
       actions. (Note: Only NGB may allocate manpower resources, to include skill level and
       grade and prepare manpower documents for ANG state headquarters according to
       approved Air Force staffing guides).
       8.1.3.4. Validate authorizations needed for the non-mobilized environment.
       8.1.3.5. Review ARC authorization skill and grade distribution to ensure they comply
       with current Air Force and DoD guidance (DoDD 1100.4) as outlined in this publication.
8.2. Establishing Manpower Requirements.
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                      49


   8.2.1. Criteria. The Air Force bases manpower authorizations approved for ARC units on:
       8.2.1.1. Established ARC manpower standards and guides, support agreements and
       programming documents.
       8.2.1.2. Approved unit type codes (UTC).
       8.2.1.3. Information and automated manpower file excerpts exchanged among gaining
       and host commands, the NGB, HQ AFRC, ANG and HAF.
   8.2.2. Requirements for Gained Units. Commands establish mobilization manpower
   requirements for gained ARC component units; these requirements state the manpower
   resources needed to augment the active forces in wartime and contingencies. (Note: Obtain
   NGB/A1M or HQ AFRC/A1M coordination before placing mobilization manpower
   requirements into MPES. Use the required grade of the active force UMD and standards for
   like functions to determine ARC required grades.)
   8.2.3. Requirements for full-time in-place and non-mobilized units. The ANG and HQ
   AFRC will determine manpower requirements needed for in-place mobilization and for
   managing, supporting and training Guard and Reserve units in a non-mobilized status.
       8.2.3.1. With justification for change, state whether the action was started by the gaining
       command or is a peacetime requirement authorized by this chapter.
       8.2.3.2. ANG and/or HQ AFRC maintains the ACRs for their respective authorizations
       included in MPES.
       8.2.3.3. Documents. The USAF Program Guidance and USAF Programs, Installations,
       Units and Priorities documents provide the numbers and types of ARC units programmed
       by time period and unit location. AF/A1M uses the Manpower Transaction Report to
       monitor manpower programs established for ANG and AFRC units.
8.3. Changes in Grade. ANG or HQ AFRC may specify military grades that differ from those
specified in the gaining command’s standard statement. This flexibility enables them to respond
to management problems inherent to the unit.
   8.3.1. Retain all enlisted required grade changes within the required AFSC and skill level
   spread shown in the governing directive Manpower Force (MANFOR Packaging System)
   detail by the gaining command. Further, do not change the authorized skill level more than
   one skill level from the required skill level unless the UTC allows. For example if the
   required skill is a 3D071, you may substitute a 3D051 or 3D091.
   8.3.2. Keep all officer required grade changes within the required AFSC and grade spread
   authorized in the governing directive (MANFOR Packaging System detail) for the gaining
   command required AFSC. Further, do not change the authorized grades more than one grade
   level from the required grade unless the UTC allows more than one grade.
   8.3.3. Restriction. Commands may not use this grade realignment guidance to shift grades
   between gaining command wartime requirements and ARC additive requirements approved
   for in-place mobilization for managing, supporting and training units in a non-mobilized
   status unless baseline enlisted and officer grade requirements are adhered to.

      9.6.1.1. Develop and maintain a schedule for the bi-annual application of approved
      manpower standards to determine full-time manpower requirements.          Standard
      application schedule will be posted on the NGB/A1M page on the AF Portal.
      9.6.1.2. Perform currency reviews in conjunction with bi-annual application of
      manpower standards.
      9.6.1.3. NGB/A1MR will notify the affected Functional Area Manager (FAM) in writing
      one quarter prior to standard application and attach a copy of the latest manpower
      standard for their review.
      9.6.1.4. The FAM will review the POD for currency to identify work no longer
      performed, or work processes that have changed since the standard was developed;
      additionally, the FAM must justify all proposed changes with regulatory (i.e., AFI)
      references and supporting documentation.
      9.6.1.5. The FAM must review each workload factor definition and source of count and
      certify that they are still accurate. If they are no longer valid, the FAM must provide a
      written explanation of changes.
      9.6.1.6. If the FAM identifies significant changes since the standard was developed,
      NGB/A1MR will forward a copy of the FAMs concerns to NGB/A1MM. The FAM,
      NGB/A1MM and NGB/A1MR will jointly determine whether the standard is still valid or
      requires update.
   9.6.2. If a standard requires major revision and is no longer a valid method of determining
   accurate manpower requirements, NGB/A1MM will schedule the function for standards
   development or standards maintenance.
      9.6.2.1. Apply most current approved manpower standards bi-annually using historical
      workload data from previous fiscal year.
      9.6.2.2. NGB/A1MR will analyze the workload data for extremes, or trends, and resolve
      data anomalies with the functional OPR. There may be approved program changes that
      will result in data that will be significantly different than historical workload data
      averages. In these cases, it is more appropriate to use projected workload for determining
      manpower requirements or less than a full year of workload data. For example, if a
      manpower standard uses flying hours to determine manpower requirements, and a unit is
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                     53


      approved to add 2000 flying hours in the next few months, do not use the ‘historical’
      average.
      9.6.2.3. Notify the affected State, units, and affected FAM one fiscal quarter before a
      scheduled ANG MS application. The notification will include all workload reporting
      requirements and any other information required to apply the ANGMS.
      9.6.2.4. Obtain FAM coordination on the standard application results prior to
      implementation.
      9.6.2.5. Coordinate all standard application results impacting resources with Chief,
      Program Development Branch (NGB/A1MP) before notifying the affected states or units
      of the results. If a standard application reduces requirements, unfunded positions will be
      removed before funded. If requirements increase, requirements will be added as
      unfunded until resources are identified. Excess resources will be returned to the ANG
      Corporate Structure to be applied to ANG corporate priorities.
      9.6.2.6. When implementation of an ANG Manpower Standard results in an increase or
      decrease in funded manpower authorizations, the MPES action requires an ‘effective
      date’ of current quarter plus two fiscal quarters (FQ) as of the first day of the following
      month of the manpower authorization change action.
   9.6.3. Perform out-of-cycle reapplication of standards as determined by the Chief,
   Requirements Branch due to short notice mission changes, force structure changes, flying
   hour changes, significant shifts in population, etc.
   9.6.4. Use the approved ANG Man-hour Availability Factor (MAF) plus the applicable
   overload factor, rounding up for standards application.
   9.6.5. Ensure authorized military grades on full-time positions are compatible with AFSC
   and skill level requirements in the ANGMS when specified and Career Progression Group
   (CPGs) limitations.
   9.6.6. Determine manpower requirements using alternative methods such as staffing patterns
   and post manning when no ANGMS is applicable.
9.7. Determining Military Manpower Requirements. NGB/A1MR Responsibilities:
   9.7.1. Review new Unit Type Codes (UTCs) and unit Designed Operational Capability
   (DOC) taskings during the initial development and staffing process to validate manpower
   requirements and determine ANG manpower impact.
   9.7.2. Build UMDs IAW gaining MAJCOM (Major Command) approved UTCs and DOC
   taskings.
      9.7.2.1. Changes must be projected on the UMD at least two fiscal quarters in advance.
      9.7.2.2. Coordinate UMD changes with appropriate gaining MAJCOMs.
      9.7.2.3. Create peacetime positions only when full-time requirements exceed UTC
      requirements or when an ANG approved mission or function is not UTC tasked.
   9.7.3. Determine authorized military grades (GRD) by applying Career Progression Group
   limits and providing grade enhancement. Due to grade enhancement, the minimum
 54                                                          AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014


   authorized grade on ANG UMDs is Staff Sergeant for enlisted and Major for officer
   positions. Required grades (RGR) will reflect the UTC requirement.
9.8. NGB/A1MR will reconcile funded UMD to allocated manpower resources.
   9.8.1. NGB/A1MP is responsible for manpower resources allocation per AFI 38-204.
   9.8.2. NGB/A1MP is also responsible for control grades allocation.
9.9. Manpower Change Request (MCR) Process.
   9.9.1. Requesting Unit Responsibilities.
   9.9.2. The Commander or supervisor will submit MCRs to NGB/A1M in accordance with
   this Instruction. (T-1). Local offices should submit ANG Manpower Change Requests via e-
   mail to A1M_Actions.

   1).
      9.9.7.1. Ensure all MCRs requesting realignment of full-time resources remain within
      valid full-time manpower requirements, allocated resources by RIC and authorized
      control grades. (T-1).
      9.9.7.2. MCRs requesting movement of resources between Program Element Codes
      (PECs) are cautionary and require additional NGB staffing and coordination. (T-1).

       AIR NATIONAL GUARD ENLISTED GRADES PROGRAM/EXECUTION

10.1. Overview. This chapter establishes policy for an enlisted grades program for all Air
National Guard (ANG) military positions at the unit level and is applicable to all enlisted grades
included in Unit Manpower Document (UMD) funded military end-strength numbers, except
those organizations, AFS(s), Special Duty Identifiers or Reporting Identifiers identified in
advance by the ANG Command Chief or Director, Air National Guard. This guidance will be
implemented by Career Field Functional Managers (CFFM)/Office of Primary Responsibility
(OPR) and the Air National Guard Manpower, Organization and Resources Division. The ANG
Enlisted Grades Program is designed to ensure that enlisted grades are equitably distributed
throughout all ANG field level units.
   10.1.1. Program Objectives. The ANG Enlisted Grades Program is designed to meet the
   following objectives:
       10.1.1.1. Ensure compliance with established grade percentages.
       10.1.1.2. Provide a method/procedure to equitably distribute enlisted grades throughout
       all ANG field level units.
       10.1.1.3. Provide Directorate Enlisted Grades Council representatives/Career Field
       Functional Managers (CFFMs) the authority to allocate grades in their Air Force
       Specialties (AFSs) they represent.
10.2. Enlisted Grades Council (EGC). The EGC will convene and review the enlisted grade
structure every two years. The Director, Air National Guard (DANG) can direct an enlisted
grade review at any time deemed necessary. The major participants in the ANG Grades Program
are: ANG Command Chief, CFFMs, EGC representatives, a representative from the ANG
Manpower Office and the Enlisted Field Advisory Council (EFAC) representatives. The
responsibilities for each of these participants are as follows:
   10.2.1. ANG Command Chief. The ANG Command Chief is responsible for ensuring
   compliance with this Instruction and chairs the EGC and makes recommendations to the
   DANG.
       10.2.1.1. CFFMs. Regardless of the Program Element Code (PEC), responsible for
       coordinating AFS(s) with Functional Area Managers (FAMs) and ensuring the grades
       allocations and distribution process supports mission requirements and career progression
       within their AFS(s). Conducts a review of the AFS/career fields and determines
       distribution while maintaining a zero within-grade balance of the total grades allocated
       for their AFS(s).
       10.2.1.2. EGC Representatives. A chief master sergeant representative is assigned by
       each A Staff and Special Staff Director as listed in paragraph 10.2.1.5 These
       representatives are responsible for the overall grades structure of all AFS(s) within their
       areas and represent the ANG corporate process on enlisted grades.
       10.2.1.3. ANG Manpower, Organization and Resources Division.      Manpower
       administers the ANG Enlisted Grades Program and co-chairs the EGC. This is
 56                                                           AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014


      accomplished by ensuring the program parameters and percentage constraints are
      established and in compliance. Manpower maintains and provides the ANG Enlisted
      Grades data. Baseline data for this process is current end of fiscal year data from the
      manpower database. Manpower will schedule the council meetings. Manpower is also
      responsible for accurately reflecting and maintaining enlisted grades in the manpower
      data system.
      10.2.1.4. Enlisted Field Advisory Council (EFAC). The EFAC will provide three
      representatives for the EGC. These members represent the voice of the field in the ANG
      corporate process on enlisted grades.
      10.2.1.5. Air Force Specialty Responsibilities by NGB A Staff and Special Staff
      Directorate.
          10.2.1.5.1. NGB/A1 - 3SX and 3M0.
          10.2.1.5.2. NGB/A2 - 1NX, 1A8 and 9SX.
          10.2.1.5.3. NGB/A3 - 1AX, 1CX, 1P0, 1SX, 1TX and 1WX.
          10.2.1.5.4. NGB/A4 - 2XZ, 2FX, 2GX, 2MX, 2PX, 2RX, 2SX, 2TX, 2WX and 6CX.
          10.2.1.5.5. NGB/A6 - 3DX.
          10.2.1.5.6. NGB/A7 - 3EX and 3PX.
          10.2.1.5.7. NGB/FM - 6FX.
          10.2.1.5.8. NGB/SG - 4X.
          10.2.1.5.9. NGB/CF - 3NX, 5JX, 5RX, 8FX, 8RX, 9EX, 9GX and HRAs.
10.3. Enlisted Grade Percentages and Allocation Process.
   10.3.1. ANG Enlisted Grade Percentages. The below percentages are the cornerstone of the
   ANG Enlisted Grades Program and are applicable to all ANG field level units. They are
   defendable to Air Staff, and are not to be exceeded as they represent a percentage of total
   ANG funded enlisted end-strength:
      10.3.1.1. CMSgt - 2%.
      10.3.1.2. SMSgt - 5%.
      10.3.1.3. MSgt - 18.5%.
      10.3.1.4. TSgt - 25.5%.
      10.3.1.5. SSgt - 49%.
   10.3.2. These percentages are applicable to all enlisted grades included in funded military
   end-strength numbers, except organizations, AFS(s), Special Duty Identifiers or Reporting
   Identifiers identified in advance by the ANG Command Chief or Director, Air National
   Guard.
10.4. ANG Enlisted Grades Allocation Process.
   10.4.1. The first foundational rule will be to apply the percentages established in paragraph
   10.3.1
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                  57


   10.4.2. The second criteria will be to ensure no Unit Type Code (UTC) was broken after
   applying the percentages. If a UTC is broken, review the UTC to ensure it is properly
   constructed. If the UTC build is deemed to be correct with respect to resources, rework the
   AFS Grade allocations through EGC.
   10.4.3. The final rule requires that all disconnects will be identified and brought to the
   attention of EGC for resolution.
10.5. Implementation. CFFMs/EGCs will work with manpower to revise the Unit Manpower
Document (UMD) to reflect the grade changes generated by the ANG Enlisted Grades
Allocation Process.
 58                                                             AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014

       new funding in the next budget cycle.
   11.2.2. Organizations/agencies external to the Air Force will:
       11.2.2.1. Process requests IAW with DoDI 1235.11, Management of Individual
       Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs).
       11.2.2.2. Submit validated IMA requirements to AFRC/A1M, through SAF/AARX for
       review and resource options.
   11.2.3. Air Force organizations, below MAJCOM level, having a requirement for an IMA,
   will forward IMA requests to their servicing MO for review, coordination and validation. (T-
   1). The servicing MO will follow the guidelines and criteria in this chapter to process the
   request.
   11.2.4. HQ AFRC/A1M Responsibilities:
       11.2.4.1. Provide guidance to manpower offices on the IMA program.
       11.2.4.2. Review all requests to ensure IMA requirements meet the established criteria.
       11.2.4.3. Program and manage IMA resources. (Note: All decisions pertaining to the
       funding of IMA requirements will be made by AF/RE.)
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                     59


11.3. Criteria. As provided for in DoDI 1235.11, IMA requirements may be established to
support mobilization (including pre- and/or post-mobilization requirements), contingency
operations, or other specialized or technical requirements to augment the active duty component
structure. Use the following guidelines when validating IMA manpower requirements:
   11.3.1. Mobilization. Mobilization is the process by which the nation makes the transition
   from a normal peacetime preparedness state to a warfighting state. It involves the assembly,
   organization and application of the nation’s resources for national defense and it
   encompasses all activities necessary to prepare systematically and selectively for war. A
   federal active duty status applying specifically to Title 10 United States Code, Section 12302
   (Partial Mobilization) and Title 10 United States Code, Section 12301 (a) (Full/Total
   Mobilization) in which an Airman is involuntarily called to active duty for the period
   specified in the applicable statute. IMA requirements earned under this criterion should
   match the Active Duty UMD requirement/ position to be backfilled or augmented.
   11.3.2. Contingency operations. The principal uses of IMAs under this criterion in support
   of manpower requirements related to Air and Space Expeditionary Forces (AEF) are as
   follows: (a) to backfill active duty positions that deploy from an AEF location; (b) fill a
   recurring AEF deployment requirement; or (c) augment Air Staff, MAJCOM and numbered
   air force (NAF) staff functions that must expand operations during these operations. The key
   basis for IMAs justified under this category requires that the IMA position either reduce the
   operations tempo (OPTEMPO) of the active force, provide workload relief for units that lose
   personnel on steady state deployment requirements, or augment MAJCOM or NAF staffs not
   manned to handle the expanded hours associated with contingency operations. IMA
   requirements earned under this criterion should match the Active Duty UMD requirement/
   position to be backfilled or augmented.
   11.3.3. Specialized, technical, or scientific. To augment active forces when the workload is
   mission essential and to maintain a military capability requiring specialized, technical, or
   scientific knowledge or experience in scope not otherwise available in the active duty force.
11.4. Additional Guidelines.
   11.4.1. IMA wartime authorizations. Before requesting IMA authorizations to satisfy
   wartime requirements, designate manpower made available by planned wartime reductions or
   eliminating peacetime workloads.
   11.4.2. Central/Single Manager Programs. IMAs with AFSCs in the chaplain, medical, legal
   and intelligence career fields are designated as "centrally managed" at AFRC. All requests
   for new IMA authorizations with these AFSCs must be coordinated with the appropriate
   AFRC functional manager. Additionally, Air Force Office of Special Investigation (AFOSI)
   is designated as a single manager for all IMAs in the AFOSI community.
   11.4.3. General Officer requirements. The Reserve General Officer Baseline Study
   periodically reviews and validates requirements and authorizations for general officers and
   mobilization assistants (MA).           The study is the basis for changes in
   requirements/authorizations to the gaining command for inclusion in MPES. AF/REG is the
   OPR for the baseline study.
   11.4.4. Days allocated for use of Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard, (or Air Reserve
   Forces (ARC)), officers, NCOs and airmen are commonly referred to as Military Personnel
 60                                                           AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014


   Appropriation (MPA) man-days because they are funded out of the military personnel
   appropriation account, an active duty account. AFI 36-2619, Military Personnel Appropriate
   (MPA) Man-Day Program, has a fuller explanation of both MPAs and man-days.
11.5. Restrictions. IMAs may not be authorized for the following purposes:
   11.5.1. To augment ARC force structure.
   11.5.2. To augment ANG units.
   11.5.3. To replace military personnel expected to be unavailable for duty because of leave,
   hospitalization, professional military education, or other temporary reason.
   11.5.4. To replace civilian employees who are Ready Reservists of the military services.
   11.5.5. To manage and train AFRC personnel when that is the sole justification for an IMA
   requirement. (Note: MAJCOMs may use management and training of IMA personnel as
   partial justification for an IMA requirement, provided the MAJCOM can demonstrate that
   proficiency in the IMA’s primary responsibilities will not be degraded; use of the IMA is
   economical and the IMA will exercise leadership and management skills required of the
   position and rank.) Additionally, MAJCOMs may assign administrative management of
   IMAs to a senior IMA position as long as it has a valid primary tasking. Active duty
   personnel within the MAJCOM retain primary responsibility for managing IMA program
   operations.
11.6. Requirements Validation Process. Processes for validating IMA requirements stem
from responsibilities delineated in DoDI 1235.11.
   11.6.1. Requests for IMA requirements generated within HAF and MAJCOMS will be
   initiated by the using organization; coordinated with the using Command Program Manager
   and Centrally Managed Program Manager, as appropriate; and forwarded to the servicing
   manpower function for review, coordination, validation and approval consideration.
   11.6.2. The using organization initiates requests for IMA requirements generated within
   OSD, Defense Agencies, Joint Staff, Unified Combatant Commands or other organizations
   and agencies external to the USAF. The servicing manpower organization validates it and
   forwards to AF/REX.
   11.6.3. IMAs may require 24 or 48 Inactive Duty for Training periods (IDT). Twenty-four
   IDTs are generally sufficient to perform the required AFSC proficiency and ancillary
   training. Forty-eight IDTs may be validated with sufficient justification.

                                          Chapter 13

  INDIVIDUAL MOBILIZATION AUGMENTEE (IMA) GENERAL POLICIES AND
                           PROCEDURES

13.1. General Information. This chapter applies to IMA authorizations below the rank of Brig
Gen at HAF, MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs and Defense Agencies.
13.2. Controlled Program Elements (PE). This instruction applies to IMA authorizations in
controlled PEs, such as the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) or Special Operations Forces
(SOF); authorizations cannot be reallocated between controlled PEs or non-controlled and
controlled PEs. (Note: This guidance does not apply to IMAs assigned to COCOMs.
Procedures will be developed for rebalancing COCOM requirements).
13.3. Execution Data. AFRC/RMG provides AFRC/A1M a listing of IMA authorizations that
have been chronically vacant. AFRC/RMG and AFRC/A1M determine the number of vacancies
that will be divested from each organization. IMA authorizations that are identified as either
surplus to requirements or no longer linked to active component missions, or authorizations no
longer required by organizations may also be added to the pool for reallocation; e.g., IMAs from
inactivated organizations.
13.4. Requirements. AFRC/A1M requests HAF, MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, and Defense
Agencies submit their unfunded IMA requirements, by RIC, AFSC, OSC and Grade in a
prioritized ‘1-to-N’ list/specified format. AFRC/A1M notifies HAF, MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs,
and Defense Agencies not to submit hard to fill requirements. Submissions will include the
reason for the requirement; i.e., mobilization, contingency operations, specialized, scientific,
technical, and economic or other operations IAW Paragraph 11.3
13.5. Allocation Model. AF/A9 has developed a model for allocating IMAs based on several
criteria including stressed career fields, CSAF priorities and the ‘1-to-N’ prioritized list.
AFRC/A1M and AF/REXX will revalidate the criteria before each IPR and AF/REXX will
submit the ‘1-to-N’ requirements list, the allocation criteria, and the number of positions to
reallocate to AF/A9 who then uses the model to provide a proposed allocation.
13.6. Allocation and Programming Guidance.
   13.6.1. Reallocations that zero balance by RIC and Budget Sub-Activity (BSA) can be
   implemented immediately upon AF/RE approval. Reallocations that don’t zero balance must
   be submitted in RAPIDS in the next POM before they can be implemented on the UMD.
   13.6.2. AF/A1M and AF/REXX makes any adjustments to the allocation deemed necessary,
   coordinates it with the appropriate offices and obtains AF/RE approval. AF/RE signs letters
   notifying organizations of their new IMA allocations.
   13.6.3. AFRC/A1M, AF/REXX and HAF, MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, and Defense Agency
   manpower offices/activities implement their allocations on the UMD IAW established MPES
   procedures. Allocations will be implemented immediately if a Zero Balance Transaction
   (ZBT) or in the program year if they require POM approval. AF/REXX programs the
   allocation in the FYDP at the earliest opportunity.
 64                                                             AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014


   13.6.4. AFRC/A1M maintains HAF, MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, and Defense Agency IMA
   allocations and insures UMDs balance to the FYDP IAW AFI 38-204.
13.7. Out of Cycle Requests. HAF, MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs and Defense Agencies may
submit urgent, high priority requests for IMAs with commensurate offsets to AFRC/A1M.
AFRC/A1M and AF/REXX will recommend approval/disapproval based on the allocation
criteria and the potential for filling the requirements.
   13.7.1. HAF, MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs and Defense Agencies may fund IMA requirements
   by submitting them, with an offset, in their organization’s POM; however, they must first be
   submitted to AFRC/A1M for validation. AFRC/A1M can, in certain situations, divest
   proposed offsets from submitting organizations if the offsets are proposed for a drastic
   mission change to a lower priority mission. A low priority mission is defined as one that is
   not listed on the CSAF’s priorities, the Air Force stressed career list, or any other Air Force
   wide document addressing service wide manpower priorities. Emphasis will be placed on
   approving realignments to mission areas of high interest to AFR for potential unitization; i.e.,
   conversion from IMA to a traditional reservist (TR) should the mission prove amenable to a
   unit concept.
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                    65

                      IMA PROGRAM REVIEW (IPR) TIMELINE

14.1. IPR Process.
   14.1.1. AFRC/A1M submits an annual IPR request to HAF, MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs, and
   Defense Agencies during the January timeframe. The IPR data call will contain a sample
   IPR spreadsheet with specific MPES fields and a suspense date will be specified at that time.
   AFRC/A1M will review and consolidate all IPR inputs and forward to AF/REXX for
   prioritization (See paragraph 14.2., Annual IPR Process Timeline).
   14.1.2. The AF/RE Mobilization Assistant is given the opportunity to review the outcome of
   the provisional IPR. The AF/RE Mobilization Assistant will share the results with their MA
   counterpart at the Air Force office and/or Defense Agencies affected by the IPR reallocation
   to acquire feedback prior to the official implementation. Concerns will be addressed prior to
   final approval.
   14.1.3. Upon AFRC/CC (or AF/RE) approval of the IMA reallocation plan, AFRC/A1M
   will forward the reallocation spreadsheet to each servicing manpower office/activity for
   UMD update. MAJCOMs/Agencies will be allowed sufficient time to submit requests for
   IMA resourcing in the annual POM/Budget cycle.
14.2. Annual IPR Process Timeline (see Figure 14 1).
   14.2.1. January. AFRC/A1M requests servicing manpower offices conduct their own IMA
   Program Review to realign positions and then submit their list of prioritized and unfunded
   requirements to AFRC/A1M.
   14.2.2. February/March. The servicing manpower office conducts the IPR. For prior year
   President’s Budget (PB) releases, the servicing MAJCOM/ A1M will work with AFRC/A1M
   to implement on the UMD.
   14.2.3. April. The servicing manpower offices submit their IPR results, to include
   realignments and new requirements, to AFRC/A1M.
   14.2.4. May/June. AFRC/A1M will review and consolidate the IPR results and AF/REX
   will prioritize the results based on Air Force priorities.
   14.2.5. July/August/September. AF/REX will develop the allocation plan and obtain AF/RE
   and AF/RE MA approval. AF/REX will also send an information copy of the allocation plan
   to the servicing manpower offices, as well as to senior MAs and adjudicate any comments
   from servicing manpower offices and MAs, and obtain AF/RE approval and allocate to the
   servicing manpower offices. Lastly, AF/REX provides a copy of the plan to the AFRC
   Functional Managers for review and recommendation of IMA authorization allocation.
   14.2.6. December. AF/RE will submit realignments and/or reallocations into the AFRC
   POM (most likely as a ZBT) and servicing manpower offices will submit requirements, not
   funded in IPR, into their own POM if desired.

                AIR FORCE RESERVE MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS

15.1. Overview. The following guidance applies to all Air Force Reserve (AFR) units
supported by the AFRC Manpower, Organization, and Resources Division (AFRC/A1M).
AFRC will provide further detailed processes and procedures to comply with this chapter in a
future AFRC Manual (AFRCMAN) in the 38-2xx series. The procedures contained in this
chapter govern the development, implementation and subsequent management of AFRC
Manpower Standards (AFRCMS) for determination of full-time manpower requirements within
AFRC. This chapter also outlines the procedures for determining AFRC military manpower
requirements.
15.2. Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) A1M Responsibility.
   15.2.1. The Division Chief of Manpower and Organization is responsible for the validation,
   distribution, and effective utilization of the manpower resources allocated to Air Force
   Reserve Command (AFRC).
15.3. Management and Innovation Flight (AFRC MIF) Responsibilities.
   15.3.1. Maintain the AFRC Management Engineering Standards Development Schedule by:
       15.3.1.1. Obtaining new Manpower study requests by sending out an AFRC-wide annual
       call for proposed studies.
       15.3.1.2. Identifying necessary standard revisions based upon any AFRC program
       changes.
       15.3.1.3. Scheduling studies identified as obsolete through currency reviews.
   15.3.2. Prepare a study plan for functions scheduled for standards development which
   include the major milestones for each major phase of the study.

       including availability of key study SMEs, supporting funding, data availability and
       function stability.
       15.3.2.2. Study Planning: Includes notifying AFRC/A1, Functional Area Manager and
       NAF/CCs of the study start date and approved study milestones. Notification will
       include the functional area, Functional Account Code (FAC), Program Element Code
       (PEC) and a statement that recommends to freeze UMD 106 actions until study
       completion. This provides a stable UMD baseline through completion of a manpower
       study.
       15.3.2.3. Study Function Research and Familiarization: This phase includes researching
       governing regulations and work center(s) responsibilities, and obtaining current UMD
       baseline. Conduct site familiarization visits if necessary as determined by the study lead.

   implementation.
   15.3.7. Format the manpower standard for publication to comply with publishing guidelines.
   Distribute approved AFRCMS by various media and place on the appropriate AFRC website.
15.4. Functional OPR Responsibilities.
   15.4.1. Function as the study OPR, liaison, and workshop arbitrator.
   15.4.2. Identify and ensure availability of Subject Matter Experts (SME) for study
   participation.
   15.4.3. Schedule, coordinate, and fund Temporary Duty (TDY) for SMEs participating in
   study meetings and workshop.
   15.4.4. Assist the AFRC MIF in the Development of the work center process oriented
   descriptions (PODs).
   15.4.5. Provide AFRC MIF all applicable regulatory references and source documents that
   govern work center processes and substantiate workload.
   15.4.6. Identify potential workload factors (WLFs) with definition and specific source for
   AFRC MIF validation.
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                      69


      15.4.6.1. Ensure WLFs are available for future standards applications.
      15.4.6.2. Notify AFRC MIF when any WLF, or other source(s), are no longer valid.
   15.4.7. Serve as the OPR for post study resolution of issues concerning measurement input
   data and standard application results with field representatives.
   15.4.8. Review Study Summary and provide acknowledgement; disagreements must be
   substantiated with complete rationale. Disagreements based solely on manpower reductions
   cannot be accommodated.
15.5. AFRC/A1MP Responsibilities.
   15.5.1. AFRC/A1MP has responsibility for management and oversight of the command
   FYDP manpower resources, Headquarters/DRU requirements, management and oversight of
   the Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) requirements and resources program,
   Organization, and Manpower Data System, i.e., Manpower Programming and Execution
   System (MPES). This branch is the command’s focal point for addressing all manpower
   actions (initiatives, disconnects, offsets, and zero balance transactions) addressed during the
   various AF PPBE exercises (POM, PB, etc.). AFRC/A1MP also:
   15.5.2. Provides AFRC MIF with an initial UMD baseline for functions under study.
   15.5.3. Maintains a stable UMD baseline through completion of a manpower study by
   placing a ‘freeze’ on any UMD updates/changes until the study is completed.
   15.5.4. Manages and oversees the command’s active duty grade requirements for colonels
   and CMSgts and the Air Force-allocated grade CPG factors.
   15.5.5. Responds to “What-if” requests for information/data from AF/RE and/or AFRC/A8.
15.6. AFRC/A1MR Responsibilities.
   15.6.1. Reviews initial UMD baseline provided by AFRC/A1MP and provides AFRC MIF
   with final vetted/validated UMD baseline for function under study.
   15.6.2. Notifies AFRC MIF of any manpower actions which may impact manpower studies
   in progress.
   15.6.3. Provides one manpower analyst to assist during standard development workshops.
   15.6.4. Conducts an initial application of new or revised manpower standards within one
   fiscal year of receiving a new approved AFRCMS.
   15.6.5. In conjunction with the functional OPR, briefs the AFRC Corporate Structure on the
   manpower standard impact application results and resource impact.
   15.6.6. Executes application results in MPES within one fiscal year of receiving a newly
   approved AFRCMS. Appropriate personnel lead time will be factored into the effective date
   of UMD changes.
   15.6.7. Unit Manpower Document Development and Maintenance.
      15.6.7.1. Unit Manpower Document (UMD). Manpower authorizations are allocated to
      units and reflected on the Unit Manpower Document as the authoritative source for all
      AFRC requirements.
70                                                        AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014


     15.6.7.1.1. The Unit Manpower Document report is a computer generated product
     from the Manpower Programming and Execution System (MPES) or Business
     Objects (BO) business intelligence reporting tool. The UMD report reflects total
     force manpower position detail for funded and unfunded requirements and Non-
     FYDP positions. MPES contains active duty, civilian, Traditional Reservists (TR),
     Active Guard Reserve (AGR), Air Reserve Technician (ART), and Individual
     Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) authorizations. These requirements are indicated by
     the respective Resource Identification Code (RIC). Units receive UMDs from their
     servicing Force Support Squadron/Flight (FSS) via the MPES. At a minimum, it is
     highly recommended that units establish a requirement to receive an updated UMD
     quarterly.
     15.6.7.1.2. There are two basic types of civilian requirements:
        15.6.7.1.2.1. Air Reserve Technicians (ART). Full-time civilian employees who
        are also members of the Air Force Reserve unit in which they are employed. In
        addition to their civilian assignments, they are assigned to an equivalent military
        requirement with appropriate rank. The ART workforce provides stable,
        continuous full-time management, administration, and training of the Ready
        Reserve and oversees the transition from a peacetime to a wartime, or national
        emergency situation, to ensure mobilization readiness is maintained. ARTs train
        reservists, provide continuity within the Reserve unit of assignment, and support
        the unit’s gaining major command.
        15.6.7.1.2.2. Civilian requirements provide peacetime support to units.
     15.6.7.1.3. The UMD contains the military requirements.
        15.6.7.1.3.1. Unit military drill requirements are military positions which have
        been established by the gaining command to accomplish the wartime mission or
        by HQ AFRC to satisfy other military requirements. These are represented by
        RIC 0020 for officer requirements and 0120 for enlisted requirements. Non ART
        drill positions constitute the units Traditional Reservist requirements.
        15.6.7.1.3.2. IMAs are individual members of the Selected Reserve or
        Participating Individual Ready Reserve assigned to an active component of the
        DoD or other U.S. Government agency in war, contingency operations and
        peacetime to meet national defense, strategic national interest and domestic
        objectives. These requirements are represented by RIC 0018, 0019, 0118, and
        0123.
     15.6.7.1.4. Unfunded Requirements. Unfunded requirements are validated UMD
     requirements which have not been funded by Congress or the HAF. Unfunded
     requirements are shown on the UMD with a MNT code of "N” or “R” in the first
     position of the MNT code.
        15.6.7.1.4.1. Overhires. Overhires are increases above current full-time funded
        UMD authorizations. Funded UMD positions may not provide sufficient
        flexibility to meet shifting, peak, seasonal, or cyclical work load demands. This
        may be particularly true in units which have a significant number of unfunded
        requirements. Overhire authorizations are designed to fill this void. HQ
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                  71


            AFRC/A1M recognizes there are special or unique needs for interim solutions to
            personnel or management problems that might be best handled by use of the
            overhire resource, these requests are staffed in TMT and approved by HQ
            AFRC/CV. The use of the overhire resource is not intended to be a permanent
            replacement of true funding. Those placed on the UMD for Uniformed Services
            and Reemploying Rights Act (USERRA) , 38 USC Chapter 43, will be placed for
            five quarters to provide for future placement of the individual. All approved
            overhire requests are staffed with AFRC/ A1C and AFRC/FM via an AFRC Form
            261, Unfunded Requirements and Overhire Authorization Advisory.
            15.6.7.1.4.2. Overhires are typically established when an increased requirement
            of a continuous nature has been validated and resources are not available to fund
            the authorization. These may result from HQ AFRC/A1M application of a
            manpower standard; AFRC/CV directed action such as early hire approval for
            unit conversions; and/or out-year program objective memorandum (POM)
            approved/ funded UMD authorizations.
            15.6.7.1.4.3. Implementation of Overhires to be covered in a future AFRCMAN.
  15.6.8. Manpower Standards. AFRC utilizes various models to determine Manpower
  requirements: Manpower Standards, Manpower Guides, Command/AF Policy, etc. The
  primary means of determining manpower requirements is through the application of AFRC
  manpower standards that result in defining fulltime equivalent (FTE). When required, HQ
  AFRC/A1MR will request workload data from the functional manager to facilitate the
  application of the standard. Standards are applied by AFRC/A1MR biennially.
     15.6.8.1. Develop and maintain a schedule for the bi-annual application of approved
     manpower standards to determine full-time manpower requirements.
     15.6.8.2. Perform currency reviews in conjunction with bi-annual application of
     manpower standards.
     15.6.8.3. Notify the affected NAF/A1M and affected AFRC FAM 60 days before a
     scheduled AFRCMS application. The notification will include all workload reporting
     requirements and any other information required to apply the AFRCMS.
     15.6.8.4. Ensure FAM reviews the POD for currency to identify work no longer
     performed, or work processes that have changed since the standard was developed;
     additionally, the FAM must justify all proposed changes with regulatory (i.e., AFI)
     references and supporting documentation.
     15.6.8.5. Ensure FAM reviews each workload factor definition and source of count and
     certify that they are still accurate. If they are no longer valid, the FAM must provide a
     written explanation of changes.
     15.6.8.6. Forward FAM identified changes to the standard to AFRC MIF. The FAM,
     AFRC MIF, and AFRC/A1MR will jointly determine whether the standard is valid, needs
     administrative update, or rescinded. If rescinded, may be used as a guide until a new
     standard is published.
     15.6.8.7. Analyze the workload data for extremes or trends and resolve data anomalies
     with the functional OPR. There may be approved program changes that will result in
 72                                                            AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014


      data that will be significantly different than historical workload data averages. In these
      cases, it is more appropriate to use projected workload for determining manpower
      requirements or less than a full year of workload data. For example, if a manpower
      standard uses flying hours to determine manpower requirements, and a unit is approved
      to add 2000 flying hours in the next few months, do not use the ‘historical’ average.
      15.6.8.8. Coordinate all standard application results impacting resources with Chief,
      Program Development Branch (AFRC/A1MP). If a standard application reduces
      requirements, unfunded positions will be removed before funded. If requirements
      increase, resources will be added as unfunded requirements until sourcing is identified.
      Excess resources will be returned to the AFRC Corporate Structure to be applied to
      AFRC corporate priorities.
      15.6.8.9. Perform out-of-cycle reapplication of standards as required in support of short
      notice mission changes, force structure changes, flying hour changes, significant shifts in
      population, etc.
      15.6.8.10. Ensure authorized military grades on full-time positions are compatible with
      AFSC and skill level requirements in the AFRCMS when specified and Career
      Progression Group (CPGs) limitations.
      15.6.8.11. Determining manpower requirements using alternative methods such as
      staffing patterns, or post manning when no AFRCMS is applicable.
   15.6.9. Determining Military Manpower Requirements.
      15.6.9.1. Validate military requirements by reviewing UTAs, DOC Taskings, new or
      modified Unit Type Codes (UTCs), TFI guidance, COCOM requirements, LCOM, and
      Active Duty manpower standards during the initial development and staffing process to
      validate manpower requirements and determine AFRC manpower impact. Determine
      military status (TR, ART, AGR, IMA) through application of the FTS Manpower
      decision matrix contained in AFI 36-2132, Full-Time Support (FTS) to the Air Force
      Reserve.
      15.6.9.2. Determine authorized military grades (GRD) by applying AFRC grade
      distribution to be defined in a future AFRCMAN. With a few exceptions, the minimum
      authorized grade on AFRC UMDs is staff sergeant for enlisted, and major for officer
      positions. Exceptions must be submitted by the respective FAM and approved by
      AFRC/CV.
15.7. FYDP/UMD Reconciliation.
   15.7.1. AFRC/A1MP is responsible for manpower resources allocation per AFI 38-204.
   15.7.2. AFRC/A1MR will reconcile funded UMD to allocated manpower resources and
   ensure AFRC/A8 panel chair obtains program over-execution authority from AF/RE prior to
   over-allocation of resources on the UMD. Develop and coordinate “What-if” requests
   presented by AF/RE or AFRC/A8.
15.8. Manpower Change Request (MCR) Process.
   15.8.1. General Information. Submit an MCR on AFRC Form 106, Manpower Change
   Request, when a UMD change is required.
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                   73


      15.8.1.1. Submit MCRs pertaining to the NAF or a reserve unit to HQ AFRC/A1MR
      MCRs are normally submitted by units; however, numbered air forces (NAF) or HQ
      AFRC staff elements may submit MCRs on the units’ behalf. NAF/A1Ms shall advise
      unit personnel on the preparation and submission of AFRC Form 106 and forward any
      questions or request for clarification on procedures to appropriate AFRC/A1MR analyst.
      15.8.1.2. Submit MCRs for the HQ AFRC staff and direct reporting units to HQ
      AFRC/A1MP. (T-1). The director or special staff chief can submit the request for
      change. (T-1).
      15.8.1.3. Locally "assumed" missions and "desired" capabilities, or “personal”
      prerogative are not acceptable reasons to request a UMD change.
15.9. Zero-Balance MCRs:
   15.9.1. Each request for an increase in UMD authorizations must be accompanied by a
   proposal for an equivalent offsetting resource/decrease from elsewhere. (T-1).
   15.9.2. Zero-balance changes will result in a ‘no cost’ action to the command. Failure to
   identify an off-setting authorization will delay processing or result in disapproval. (T-1).
   15.9.3. Non-Zero Balance (NZBT) is any action that increases authorizations, skill level or
   grade of a requirement or moves funding between PECs without a corresponding offset.
   NZBT requests expend Command resources thus require a minimum of AFRC/CV approval.
   (T-1).
15.10. MCRs in Cost Compared Areas:
   15.10.1. Functional areas operating under a most efficient organization (MEO), based on an
   Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 cost comparison, are not prohibited
   from submitting changes. To ensure all levels of review for MCRs, in functions involved in,
   or the result of, an A-76 Cost Comparison, the following statement must be included on the
   AFRC Form 106: "I certify that the manpower change outlined in this request will not cause
   this unit to exceed the government cost estimate as outlined in OMB Circular A-76." (T-0).
   15.10.2. AFRC Form 106 is not required for changes in base operating support functions
   subject to performance work statement (PWS) revisions. HQ AFRC MIF evaluates
   published PWS revisions to determine manpower impact and notify the functional office of
   primary responsibility (OPR) of the results. UMDs are adjusted as required.
15.11. Special Circumstance Positions:
   15.11.1. Group Superintendents.
   15.11.1.1. Requests for Group Superintendents are a resource zero balance transaction thus
   an offset will be provided. (T-1). The offset provided should generally be in the grade of
   CMSgt.
   15.11.2. Client System Technicians (CST) are earned under a 1 to 150 ratio verse fulltime
   population supported resulting in a fulltime CST. (T-1). For traditional reservists 1 to 150
   ratio against Traditional Reservist (TR) positions only (TR, does not include the military
   position of the ART). (T-1). The result of this drill will be two numbers, fulltime and
   traditional reservist CST support respectively as directed by SAF A6. (T-1).
74                                                           AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014


  15.11.3. There are other instances that may require corporate staffing that may provide
  special dispensation which will be incorporated into future revisions of this instruction or
  codified in the future AFRCMAN.
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                         75


                                            Chapter 16

      AIR FORCE RESERVE OFFICER AND ENLISTED MANPOWER GRADES
                            DISTRIBUTION

16.1. Manpower Grade Distribution Overview. This chapter establishes policy for an enlisted
grades program for all Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) military positions at the unit level
and is applicable to all enlisted grades included in Unit Manpower Document (UMD). The
intent of this distribution is to provide for a career progression group exercise for all Officer and
Enlisted Air Force Specialty Codes. It recognizes the advanced technical position of reservists
and addresses career progression and recruitment issues unique to AFRC. This policy will be
used in an analogous fashion as active duty CPG exercises to affect authorized allocations and
not to be used to determine grade requirements. Although exempted from Chapter 4, Military
Grades, AFRC uses this chapter for its spirit and intent as a guide where it makes sense and does
not hinder the AFRC mission and or recruiting and retention efforts.
16.2. AFRC applies this program to the first three digits of the AFS, not including any
prefix (use of AFECD and AFOCD is paramount to this policy). An understanding of the
Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) concept is integral to the application of this AFI. Offices shall
refer to the Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) Codes (Atch 5) of Air Force Enlisted Classification
Directory (AFECD) when determining all E-9 grades and applied IAW the future AFRCMAN,
when published.
16.3. The authorized grade, identified as “grade” on the UMD, will be constrained to no
more than one grade higher than the required grade. (T-1).
16.4. This distribution will be applied during significant mission changes and during
Design Operational Capability/UTC Availability (DOC/ UTA) reviews. (T-1).
16.5. Movement of grades between AFSCs will not be authorized as grades are not a
commodity for trading. (T-1). Movement would disrupt the CPG of each AFSC and cause a
need to reapply the guide to retain a proper pyramid for career progression. Grades are earned in
order to maintain proper skill level to be successful at the mission for the unit/office they are
allocated.
16.6. AFRC Enlisted Grade Percentages. The below percentages are the cornerstone of the
AFRC Enlisted Grades Program and are applicable to all AFRC field level units. They are
defendable to Air Staff, and are not to be exceeded as they represent a percentage of total AFRC
funded enlisted end-strength.
   16.6.1. Operations “Rated Aircrew:”
       16.6.1.1. CMSgt – 3.2%.
       16.6.1.2. SMSgt – 5.4%.
       16.6.1.3. MSgt - 23%.
       16.6.1.4. TSgt - 41%.
       16.6.1.5. SSgt – 22.4%.
   16.6.2. All Others:

      16.6.2.1. CMSgt – 1.6%.
      16.6.2.2. SMSgt – 5.4%.
      16.6.2.3. MSgt - 17%.
      16.6.2.4. TSgt - 28%.
      16.6.2.5. SSgt - 48%.
16.7. Officer Support and Maintenance Grades:
16.7.1. Required Grade:
      16.7.1.1. Establish O2 and O3 requirements as Captain
      16.7.1.2. Establish O4 requirements as Major
      16.7.1.3. Establish O5 requirements as Lt Colonel
      16.7.1.4. Establish O6 requirements as Colonel
   16.7.2. Authorized Grade:
      16.7.2.1. Applied by AFS, exclude directed requirements (i.e. Commanders)
      16.7.2.2. Establish all Captains as Major
      16.7.2.3. Establish 37.5% as Lt Colonel and 62.5% as Major
16.8. Officer Operations grades will be defined in a future AFRCMAN due to the specific
nature of MPES requirements.
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                    77


                                         Chapter 17

                       AIRCREW MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS

17.1. Overview. Public Law and Air Force policy establish specific restrictions on aircrew
manpower authorizations. To comply with these restrictions, all organizations must strictly
control aircrew authorization growth. All changes to aircrew requirements (except flight
surgeons) must be approved no later than one year prior to the date of the proposed requirement
change. This one-year lead time provides time to implement any necessary changes in aircrew
production or manning levels to support the change. The Manpower community is responsible
for determining and documenting Aircrew Manpower Requirements. All changes to aircrew
authorizations must be coordinated with Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, Plans
and Requirements, Directorate of Force Management (AF/A3O-A). This chapter does not apply
to the ARC. AFI 11-412, Aircrew Management, establishes aircrew management procedures.
17.2. Roles and Responsibilities.
   17.2.1. Headquarters Air Force.
       17.2.1.1. AF/A1M determines and validates the aircrew manpower requirements in
       coordination with AF/A3O and maintains the MPES database for aircrew manpower
       requirements and authorizations (with exception of the Specialized Undergraduate Pilot
       Training Flying Training Resource Allocation Programming model in AETC).
       17.2.1.2. AF/A3O establishes the rated baseline(s) for MAJCOM operations (A3) and
       provides an information copy to the MAJCOM manpower staff using end of FY
       requirements. The baseline will set each command’s maximum total pilots, combat
       system officers (CSO), air battle managers (ABM) and Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA)
       pilots by category.
       17.2.1.3. AF/A3O-A.
          17.2.1.3.1. Evaluates requests for new positions and changes to existing
          authorizations and forwards approval or disapproval to the requester. Helps identify
          offsets to growth requirements, where appropriate and directed.
          17.2.1.3.2. Ensures approved and funded crew ratio changes are incorporated into
          AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors. Suspense for change inputs is
          31 December of each year. See paragraph 15.3.1 regarding the process to establish
          or change a crew ratio or crew complement.
          17.2.1.3.3. Updates aircrew authorizations estimate using funded aircrew ratios.
          17.2.1.3.4. Analyzes annual review of aircrew authorizations from each MAJCOM
          manpower staff and joint command or agency and returns comments or required
          corrections as needed.
          17.2.1.3.5. Maintains the Aircrew 480 System (A480S). The A480S is a web-based
          tool providing multi-level coordination and approval of new and changed aircrew
          manpower authorizations. The system maintains a record of aircrew requirements for
          review and analysis.
78                                                          AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014


     17.2.1.4. The Air Force Medical Support Agency, Healthcare Operations (AFMSA/SG3)
     evaluates requests for new Aircrew Position Identifier (API) 5 positions or changes to
     existing authorizations and forwards approval or disapproval to the originator. See Table
     17.1 for a list of the API codes.
  17.2.2. MAJCOM level (including DRUs and FOAs).
     17.2.2.1. Functional OPR.
        17.2.2.1.1. Assigns aircrew AFSCs only to those positions with duties clearly
        requiring aircrew skills as described in the AFOCD and AFECD found on the MA
        website. Ensures aircrew positions are established at the lowest organizational level
        consistent with mission requirements.
        17.2.2.1.2. Assigns a functional OPR to coordinate changes to aircrew authorizations
        with AF/A3O-A and to coordinate flight surgeon requirements with AFMSA/SG3.
        Forwards OPR information to AF/A3O-A and AFMSA/SG3.
        17.2.2.1.3. Submits all changes and new requests in sufficient time to be approved no
        later than one year prior to the date of the proposed requirement change. This
        provides time to implement any necessary changes in aircrew production or manning
        levels to support the change. MAJCOMs (ACC, AETC, AFGSC, AFMC, AFSOC,
        AFSPC, AMC, PACAF and USAFE) have been delegated responsibility for
        management of non-API 5 aircrew requirements (grade, API, AFSC, etc.) within
        overall Aircrew Specialty (pilots, CSOs, ABMs and RPAs and Career Enlisted
        Aviators (CEA)) and Major Weapon System (MWS) Category (Fighter, Bomber,
        Mobility, etc.) levels determined by AF/A3O-A. All other organizations must
        coordinate any changes to aircrew authorizations with AF/A3O-A. Reserve
        components must coordinate any change in Regular Air Force aircrew positions with
        AF/A3O-A. (Note: All aircrew positions must be documented and approved, either
        with an AF Form 480, Aircrew AFSC / Active Flying Justification, or electronic
        equivalent, through channels to AF/A3O-A, per AFI 11-402, Aviation and
        Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Aviation Badges).
        17.2.2.1.4. Submits all changes and new requests for rated justification for flight
        surgeon positions (API 5) directly to AFMSA/SG3.
        17.2.2.1.5. Identifies potential offsetting authorizations for new aircrew
        requirements. Additions or changes to aircrew requirements are possible only with
        offsets within the same aircrew specialty and MWS category.               Offsetting
        authorizations are also required for any aircrew changes generated by new manpower
        standards or the reapplication of existing manpower standards.
     17.2.2.2. Operations (A3). Approves additions or changes to aircrew authorizations
     (except flight surgeons) and maintains the command’s baseline requirements. Any
     change to the baseline requirements must be approved in advance by AF/A3O-A. The
     functional OPR maintains a current file of all AF Forms 480 or A480S electronic
     equivalent.
     17.2.2.3. Surgeon General. Manages the justification process for flight surgeons with
     API 5 as described in AFI 11-401, Aviation Management. For requirements not covered
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                   79


       by a manpower standard, submit the AF Form 480 or A480S electronic equivalent
       directly to AFMSA/SG3.
       17.2.2.4. AF/A1M. Assigns aircrew AFSCs with applicable API codes only to those
       positions where duties clearly require aircrew skills as described in the AFOCD and
       AFECD found on the AFPC/MA website. Ensures aircrew positions are established at
       the lowest organizational level consistent with mission requirements, and coordinates
       with the MAJCOM A3 or equivalent to validate aircrew requirement changes and the
       annual review of aircrew authorizations. Updates manpower requirement API codes in
       MPES to reflect approval of new or changed positions—an aircrew AFSC without an
       API is not a valid position.
   17.2.3. Installation Level.
       17.2.3.1. Installation functional managers will forward requests for new authorizations,
       and changes to existing authorizations, to the installation manpower office, who in turn
       will forward to the MAJCOM manpower staff for validation and coordination with the
       MAJCOM functional authority. (T-1). The installation functional manager will also
       conduct an annual review of aircrew authorizations as directed by the MAJCOM;
       maintain a current file of all AF Form 480 or equivalent A480S data electronically,
       document supporting justification (include AF Form 480 or A480S electronic equivalent,
       as required) and coordinate aircrew position requests with the installation manpower
       office. (T-1).
       17.2.3.2. The installation manpower office will coordinate with the functional authority
       on aircrew data changes and the annual review of aircrew authorizations and submit
       MPES changes to the MAJCOM manpower staff. (T-1).
17.3. Specific Areas of Responsibility.
   17.3.1. Crew Ratio or Crew Complements.
       17.3.1.1. Existing Crew Ratios or Crew Complements. MAJCOM-level Strategic Plans
       and Programs (A8) submits proposed changes to existing crew ratios or crew
       complements to the Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff for Strategic Plan and Programs,
       Directorate of Programs (AF/A8P), with a copy provided to AF/A3O-A. AF/A8P will
       coordinate the proposed change with AF/A1M and AF/A3O-A. Once AF/A8P approves
       the proposed changes, they will inform the MAJCOM-level manpower function for
       programming and AF/A3O-A who will ensure that funded changes are made to AFI 65-
       503. Changes must be received by AF/A3O-A no later than 31 December to be included
       in the annual update to AFI 65-503.
       17.3.1.2. New Crew Ratios or Crew Complements. Lead commands submit proposed
       crew ratios and crew complements with justification as part of the Operational
       Requirements Document (ORD) for aircraft scheduled to enter the inventory. These
       ORDs require AF/A3O coordination. Once the ORD is approved, AF/A8P will inform
       AF/A3O-A, who will ensure that the changes are made to AFI 65-503. Changes must be
       received by AF/A3O-A not later than 31 December to be included in the annual update to
       AFI 65-503. Note: For approval of nonrated or non-CEA aircrew “X-prefixed” (non-
       API coded) Duty Air Force Specialty Code (DAFSC) positions, submit an AF Forms 480
       or electronic equivalent through channels to AF/A3O-A IAW AFI 11-402.
 80                                                            AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014


    17.3.2. Programmed Flying Training (PFT) Positions.
       17.3.2.1. Forward methodology used to determine PFT instructor requirements,
       including any methodology changes or deviations, to AF/A3O-A. Document all PFT
       methodologies as a policy directive, pamphlet, or operating instruction.
       17.3.2.2. MAJCOM Operations (A3), in coordination with their MAJCOM manpower
       staff, will submit advanced student requirements to AF/A3O-A as required by AFI 11-
       412. Summarize these requirements by Mission Design Series (MDS), course number
       and crew position for each year of the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).
       Determine all advanced student requirements (average daily student load) by multiplying
       approved annual student production or loads by course length in calendar days and
       dividing by the number of training days with a given year (i.e., AETC flying training
       days per year is 246 for 2009).
       17.3.2.3. As the PFT student load changes, instructor requirements will likely change.
       Commands that conduct formal aircrew training will submit instructor aircrew change
       requests to AF/A1M who coordinates with AF/A3O-A for approval.
    17.3.3. Positions based on manpower standards. For flying unit staff positions based on
    manpower standards (e.g., operational support squadron positions), MAJCOM/A1Ms must
    submit proposed changes to existing aircrew manpower standards or reapplication of existing
    manpower standards with justification through AFPC/CC to AF/A1M for approval.
    AF/A1M forwards to AF/A3O-A for recommendation and coordination.
    17.3.4. Other aircrew positions. Staff positions include all aircrew positions not mentioned
    in above paragraphs. The MAJCOM must provide offsetting authorizations for any new
    aircrew staff requirements. Additions or changes are possible only with offsets for API
    codes within the same aircrew specialty. Offsetting authorizations are also required for any
    aircrew staff changes generated by new manpower standards or the reapplication of existing
    manpower standards.
17.4. Coding Aircrew Manpower Requirements and Authorizations.
    17.4.1. Aircrew Position Identifier (API) Coding. All aircrew manpower authorizations
    require an API code IAW AFI 11-401, Table 2.1., to include an explanation of how the API
    code was determined. All nonrated officer DAFSC positions will be assigned API 0 and
    non-CEA enlisted positions will be assigned API Z. Table 17.1 lists all API codes.

    17.4.2. Manpower Standard Implementation (MSI) code. The MSI code is a key indicator
    concerning the management of aircrew authorizations. It is essential MAJCOM manpower
    staffs maintain correct MSI codes in MPES tied to aircrews. The MSI code for “crew ratio”
    is “F”.
17.5. Annual Aircrew Authorization Review. During the annual review of aircrew
authorizations, the following must be accomplished, per AFI 11-412, Aircrew Management:
    17.5.1. Revalidate all API 1/2/9/A and aircrew prefixed (nonrated or non-CEA) DAFSC
    requirements and verify correct application of all API attributes.
    17.5.2. Review and revalidate all aircrew staff positions to ensure aviator expertise is
    required. If desired, staff reviews may be accomplished in quarterly increments; forward the
    results of the annual review to AF/A3O-A no later than 31 October of each year.
    17.5.3. The CFM or functional OPR maintains a current file of all AF Forms 480 (or
    maintains equivalent data electronically).
17.6. Aircrew Manpower Requirements and Authorizations Documentation.
    17.6.1. Pilot, CSO, ABM, and RPA pilot requirements in AFSCs other than 11X/12X/13B
    and 18X must have a “P” or “N” prefix to specify a Rated requirement. The AFOCD found
    on the MA website establishes which AFSCs are authorized to have the “P” or “N” prefix. In
    addition, the AFOCD requires a suffix to be added indicating the required MWS background
    (e.g., P62E3W, P10C0P). This suffix takes precedence over normal AFSC shred-out codes.
    17.6.2. An AF Form 480, Rated Position Description, (or electronic equivalent) is required
    for all positions except those with a grade of colonel (O-6) or higher. The AF Form 480 or
    A480S form must clearly justify the requirement for aviator expertise (see Attachment 7 for
    instructions).
    17.6.3. The AF Form 480, or A480S electronic equivalent, justification is a unique
    combination of AFSC, API code, duty description and aviator justifications. Except for O-6
    and higher positions, any changes to the duty requirements that substantially alter the basis
    for the original position approval invalidate the original AF Form 480. The position must be
    revalidated and resubmitted for approval to MAJCOM A3 Aircrew Managers (for MAJCOM
    billets), AFMOA/SG3 (for API 5 Billets), or AF/A3O-A for all other billets. Changes to
82                                                           AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014


  MPES are not authorized to be effective prior to approval. In addition, approval is required
  for the following changes:
     17.6.3.1. Changing from one rated specialty to another rated specialty (e.g., pilot to NAV
     or ABM to pilot).
     17.6.3.2. Changing from a generalist AFSC (e.g., 11G3, 12G4, P62E3W, N80C0W) to a
     MWS generalist or specific AFSC (e.g., 11F3Y, 12B3A, P62E3P, N80C0R).
     17.6.3.3. Changing from a MWS generalist AFSC (e.g., 11F3Y, 12B4Y) to a MWS-
     specific AFSC (e.g., 11F3F, 12B4A).
     17.6.3.4. Changing from one MWS AFSC to another MWS AFSC (e.g., 11M3Y to
     11F3Y).
     17.6.3.5. Changing from one AFS to another (e.g., 1A0XX to 1A2XX).
     17.6.3.6. Changes in API code from non-flying duties to flying duties (e.g., API 3 to 6,
     API E to D).
     17.6.3.7. Transfers of an authorization from one command or joint agency to another.
     17.6.3.8. Additions of new non-rated officer or non-CEA enlisted aircrew prefixed (X-
     prefix) DAFSC positions per AFI 11-402.

AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                         91


missions. FYDP end strength is allocated to Commands by program element code (PEC) and
category (officer, enlisted and civilian).
Centrally Managed—Functions with IMAs in chaplain (HC), medical (SG) or legal (JA) career
fields, in which all IMA requirements are ‘centrally’ managed HQ AFRC functional manager.
Any request to add or eliminate one of these IMA specialties must be coordinated with the
appropriate HQ AFRC functional manager.
Chronically Vacant—IMA authorizations that have not been filled for more than 18
consecutive months.
Contract Full—Time Equivalent—A CFTE is a calculated based on a 2080 annual hours as
mandated in The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (Public Law 99-272,
April 7, 1986) which amended 5 U.S.C. 5504(b). Prior to then an hourly rate of basic pay was
computed by dividing the employee's annual rate of basic pay by 2,080 hours (the number of
hours in 52 workweeks of 40 hours) and rounding to the nearest cent. This formula presumes a
calendar year consisting of exactly 52 weeks or 364 days. However, a calendar year actually
consists of either 365 or 366 days. Thus, a calendar year may have more paid workdays than a
52-week year. A General Accounting Office study published in 1981 demonstrated that over a
28-year period (the period of time it takes for the calendar to repeat itself) there are, on average,
2,087 work hours per calendar year. This average results from the fact there are usually 4 years
with 262 workdays (2,096 hours), 17 years with 261 workdays (2,088 hours), and 7 years with
260 workdays (2,080 hours). The 2,087 divisor is derived from the following formula: (2,096
hours*4 years) + (2,088 hours*17 years) + (2,080 hours*7 years) / 28 years = 2,087.143 hours.
Using 2,087 as the average number of work hours in a calendar year reasonably accommodates
the year-to-year fluctuations in work hours.
Controlled Program Element—Any program that is funded outside of AFRC and controlled by
a separate agency, such as Special Operations Forces or Military Intelligence Program.
Enterprise-Wide Contract Manpower Reporting Application—The ECMRA is an online
data system that automates the collection of contractor labor hours, from direct contractor inputs,
to improve DoD visibility of contractor services. The ECMRA captures information of the
funding source, contract vehicle, organization supported, the function being performed, the labor
hours, and labor costs for contracted services.
Full Commercial Activities Exempt—Commercial Activities that are exempted from private
sector performance by law, Executive Order (EO), treaty, or international agreement (IA).
Full—Time Equivalent—A FTE is a measure of workload; a daily work allocation is 8 hours,
and a yearly allocation may be 2080 hours (40 hours per week for 52 weeks). An individual's
work duration may be determined based on the person's FTE in the following way, for a given
period of two work days: 0.75 FTE (assumed) x 2 workdays (given) x 8 hours per workday
(typical allocation rate) = 12 hours work duration.
Inherently Governmental/Commercial Activity—Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR)
Act of 1998, Public Law 105-270, mandates that all functions within the federal government be
coded into one of three categories, Inherently Governmental (IG) , Commercial Activity Exempt
(CE), or Commercial Activity (CA). This act serves two primary functions, ensure IG functions
remain in-house and to achieve savings and effectiveness of CAs through cost analysis. The act
further mandates that the coding of all Air Force authorizations, with the exception of Non-

appropriated Fund (NAF) and some intelligence authorizations, be reported to Congress on an
annual basis.
Inventory for Contract Services (ICS)—As required by U.S.C. Title 10, Section 2330a, the
intent of the ICS is for the DoD to provide an inventory of contract service support, to include
the contractor labor hours expended, and report this by the end of the 3rd quarter of the next fiscal
year. This includes a service-level review of the inventory to ensure contractors are not
performing inherently governmental work; that to the maximum extent, contractors are not
performing close to inherently governmental work; that any personal service contracts being
performed are within statutory and regulatory guidance; and to identify any support contractor
activities that may be considered for conversion to government performance.
Management Advisory Study (MAS)—A consultant service offered and provided by the
manpower office vis-a-vis a client/consultant relationship between the MO and the requesting
unit/agency to analyze problems such as excessive overtime, meeting suspenses, high error rates,
morale problems, layout analysis, paperwork flow, work distribution and misplaced manpower.
This service is not used to justify additional manpower requirements or to identify excess and/or
available unit personnel. Simply put, a MAS is a process to assist functions in identifying
efficiencies and/or better ways of operating.
Man-hour Availability Factor (MAF)—This factor is the average number of man-hours per
month an assigned individual is available to do assigned duties. Required man-hours are divided
by the MAF times the overload factor to determine the manpower requirements.
Man-hour—A unit of measuring work. It is equivalent to one person working at a normal pace
for 60 minutes, two people working at a normal pace for 30 minutes, or a similar combination of
people working at a normal pace for a period of time equal to 60 minutes.
Manpower Authorization—A funded manpower requirement with detail that defines the
position in terms of its function, organization, location, skill, grade, and other appropriate
characteristics which commands use to extend end strength resources to units. May appear as a
“funded” or “unfunded” authorization on the UMD and in MPES.
Manpower Requirement—Joint Publication 1-02 defines manpower requirements as human
resources needed to accomplish a specified job, workload, mission, or program. There are two
types of manpower requirements: funded and unfunded. Funded manpower requirements are
those that have been validated and allocated. Unfunded requirements are validated manpower
needs that have been deferred because of budgetary constraints. Manpower requirements are
generally determined by an Air Force Manpower Standard or other management decision.
Manpower Standard—The basic tool used to determine the most effective and efficient level of
manpower required to support a function. It is a quantitative expression that represents a work
center's man-hour requirements in response to varying levels of workload.
Out of Cycle Request—Outside the annual IMA Program Review.
Overload Factor—The overload factor is applied in conjunction with certain MAFs during the
manpower standards application and ensures effective use of Air Force manpower
authorizations. The overload factor realizes Air Force leadership‘s expectation that some
overtime is an effective tool instead of adding additional manpower requirements.

Unfunded Manpower Requirement—An approved manpower requirement on the UMD that
reflects recognized and/or necessary workload, however which is not funded—meaning no
individual can be assigned to, or PCSed to the position.
USERRA—The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA),
38 USC chapter 43, protects service members' reemployment rights when returning from a
period of service in the uniformed services, including those called up from the reserves or
National Guard, and prohibits employer discrimination based on military service or obligation.
The U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS)
administers USERRA. USERRA is primarily an Air Reserve Component program.
Unit Manpower Document (UMD)—The Unit Manpower Document report is a computer
generated product from the Manpower Programming and Execution System (MPES) or Business
Objects (BO) business intelligence reporting tool that contains active duty military, civilian,
traditional reservists (TR), Active Guard Reserve (AGR), Air Reserve Technician (ART), and
Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) authorizations. The UMD report reflects total force
manpower position information for funded authorizations, unfunded requirements, and Non-
FYDP positions by unit and work center.
Workforce Mix (WFM)—The effective determination and management of the appropriate mix
of manpower categories (military personnel (Active Duty, Reserve, IMAs, and National Guard),
DoD civilian employees, and contracted services) within an activity, regardless the level.
Workload Factor (WLF)—An index or unit of measure that is consistently expressive of, or
relatable to, the manpower required to accomplish the quantitatively and qualitatively defined
responsibilities of a work center.

      DETERMINING AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANPOWER REQUIREMENTS
            USING MAINTENANCE MAN-HOUR PER FLYING HOUR

A2.1. General Instructions. Aircraft maintenance manpower requirements are usually
determined using a combination of LCOM and other available manpower standards. As a last
resort to traditional methods, aircraft maintenance manpower requirements may be determined
using the MMH/FH formula. The results of the formula, when combined with existing standards
or other calculations as described below, will determine manpower requirements for an entire
maintenance organization. It will not identify requirements by individual work center.
   A2.1.1. The following paragraphs explain the features of MMH/FH formula and other
   calculations that can be used.
         A2.1.1.1. Monthly Flying Hours (MFH). These are the total number of flying hours per
         month per primary aircraft authorized (PAA) flown by the Wing’s assigned squadrons.
         A2.1.1.2. PAA. This is the total number of aircraft authorized to support the unit’s
         primary mission.
         A2.1.1.3. MMH/FH. This is a factor developed and maintained by the owning command
         for each aircraft MDS assigned. It is based on maintenance data collected from the
         appropriate Maintenance Data Collection (MDC) system. Typically, MDC data
         information is collected for each direct-maintenance action accomplished on an MDS.
         This data is totaled and then divided by the number of flying hours for that MDS. This is
         normally done on a monthly basis. The resulting quotient is called the MMH/FH Factor.
         A2.1.1.4. Man-hour Availability Factor (MAF). The MAF is the average number of
         man-hours per month an assigned individual is available to accomplish assigned duties
         (direct and indirect work).
         A2.1.1.5. Overload Factor. Certain predefined overload factors are applied with certain
         MAFs. Application of the overload factor ensures effective use of Air Force manpower
         resources. It is derived from Air Force leadership's expectation that our workforce can
         work more than an 8-hour workday before hiring additional workforce that might be
         partially unproductive.

         A2.1.1.6. Direct Maintenance Requirements. This step of the computation determines
         aircraft maintenance manpower requirements for all flight line and back-shop. It does not
         include munitions; aerospace ground equipment (AGE); aircrew flight equipment (AFE);
         shop support; transient maintenance; test, measurement and diagnostic equipment; and
         aircrew training services.
         A2.1.1.7. Maintenance Support. This step of the computation determines manpower
         requirements for those elements of maintenance work which cannot be identified with a
         specific aircraft.
            A2.1.1.7.1. AGE. The maintenance support for AGE includes credit for both
            powered and non-powered AGE. When applicable, use approved manpower
            standards.
            A2.1.1.7.2. Aircrew Flight Equipment. Maintenance of AFE includes repair of flight
            clothing, parachute equipment, life rafts and preservers, etc. When applicable, use
            approved manpower standards.
            A2.1.1.7.3. Shop Support. The shop support includes work performed on items
            withdrawn from supply (excluding engines) not related to an aircraft or other end
            pieces of equipment such as AGE, trainers and non-aerospace equipment and items
            received from non-aircraft maintenance activities. Shop support does not include
            man-hours expended in AGE and AFE work centers.
         A2.1.1.8. Additives. This step of the computation determines manpower required for
         munitions maintenance and maintenance of specialized equipment (e.g., electronic
         countermeasures pods, mission crew capsules for the EC-130 aircraft) required by the
         aircraft for mission performance. This factor is determined by the owning command.
         A2.1.1.9. Maintenance Overhead. This step of the computation determines manpower
         requirements for all activities related to managing aircraft maintenance staff support
         activities at the group level. When applicable, use approved manpower standards.

Note: The .5 rounding rule is inappropriate for work centers of six or less civilians because it
could subject incumbents to overtime requirements exceeding the normal Air Force standard of
7.7 percent overload. For example: assume the result of Step 4 is 356 mhrs; 356/149.9 MAF =
2.37 and rounds down to 2 requirements. The .37 manpower space or 55.46 mhrs is overtime
work to be shared by the 2 incumbents and equates to an 18-percent overload factor
(55.46/(149.9*2) = 18%).

                 MANPOWER WORKFORCE MIX DECISION PROCESS

A5.1. Decision Process. The following steps describe the decision process used to determine
type of manpower (military, civilian, or contract service) to use when validating manpower
requirements. See Figure A5.1 for a graphic illustration.
Step 1. Validated Manpower Requirement. A validated manpower requirement is a unit of
work, usually expressed in whole man-years that a MAJCOM manpower staff recognizes as a
requirement for mission accomplishment. After validating a manpower requirement, the
MAJCOM goes to Step 2.

Step 2. Is Military Incumbency Required for Unit Mission? To answer this basic question,
review Table A5.1., rules 1 through 11. If the answer is yes, go to Step 3. If the answer is no,
go to Step 13.

Step 3. Is Full-time Capability Required? Decide whether the work must be performed during
wartime only and need not be performed daily during peacetime. If the answer is no, go to Step
4. If yes, go to Step 5.

Step 4. Provide Air Reserve Force Authorization. Identify the workload requirement to
AF/A1M so that it can give the proper ARC authorization.

Step 5. Are Active Military Skills Available? Check AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military
Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), to determine whether proper AFSCs exist to perform the
workload. You may need to check with the MAJCOM personnel office and with AFPC/A1P to
determine if military skills are available. If yes, go to Step 6. If no, go to Step 7.

Step 6. Provide Active Military Authorization. The MAJCOM funds active military
authorization.

Step 7. Is the workload appropriate for procurement by a contract? Check the current Federal
Acquisitions Regulation (FAR), Defense FAR, Air Force FAR, and other applicable DoD and
Air Force guidance regarding applicability of the workload for contract. (Examples include
OMB Circulars and DoDI 1100.22.)

Step 8. Are Contract Services Available? If the MAJCOM or installation contracting office
determines that contract services are available, go to Step 9. If not, go to Step 10.

Step 9. Use Interim Contract Until Resources Available. The MAJCOM approves an interim
contract until military resources can be planned and made available.

Step 10. Are Civilian Skills Available? The MAJCOM or local civilian personnel office
determines whether civilian skills are available. If no, go to Step 11. If yes, go to Step 12.
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                       103


Step 11. Elevate to HAF. The MAJCOM or local civilian personnel office recommends
alternatives to HAF for resolution.

Step 12. Interim Use of Civilians Until Military Resources are Available. The MAJCOM
approves interim use of civilians until military resources can be planned and made available.

Step 13. Is Military Incumbency Required for Air Force-wide Mission? Review Table A5.1.,
rules 9 through 13. If the answer is yes, go to Step 3. If no, go to Step 14.

Step 14. Is In-Service Civilian Incumbent Required? Review Table A5.2., rules 1 through 9. If
yes, go to Step 15. If no, go to Step 23.

Step 15. Are Civilian Skills Available? See Step 10 for review procedures. If yes, go to Step
16. If no, go to Step 17.

Step 16. Provide Civilian Authorization. The MAJCOM gives civilian authorization.

Step 17. Are Active Military Skills Available? See Step 5 for review procedures. If yes, go to
Step 18. If no, go to Step 19.

Step 18. Interim Use of Military Until Resources Available. The MAJCOM approves interim
use of military personnel until civilian resources can be programmed and made available.

Step 19. Is There a Legally Contractible Workload? See Step 7 for procedures. If no, go to Step
20. If yes, go to Step 21.

Step 20. Surface to HAF. See Step 11.

Step 21. Are Contract Services Available? See Step 8 for procedures. If yes, go to Step 22. If
no, go to Step 20.

Step 22. Interim Contract Until Resources Become Available. See Step 9.

Step 23. Is There a Legally Contractible Workload? See Step 7. If yes, go to Step 24. If no, go
to Step 27.

Step 24. Are Contract Services Available? See Step 8. If yes, go to Step 25. If no, go to Step
27.

Step 25. Are Contract Services Less Expensive? When mission changes or wartime taskings
dictate a review of a commercial activity, a cost comparison is appropriate. To do the review,
compare all relevant costs. If yes, go to Step 26. If no, go to Step 27.

Step 26. Procure Contract Services. The contracting office procures contract services.

Step 27. Are Civilian Skills Available? See Step 10 for procedures. If yes, go to Step 28. If no,
go to Step 29.

Step 28. Are Civilian Authorizations Provided? The MAJCOM gives civilian authorization.

Step 29. Are Military Skills Available? See Step 5 for procedures. If yes, go to Step 30. If no,
go to Step 31.

Step 30. Interim Use of Military Until Resources Available. The MAJCOM approves interim
use of military personnel until civilian resources can be programmed and made available.

Step 31. Surface to HAF. Recommended alternatives must be surfaced to HAF for resolution.

   A8.1.2. Operations Concept. Briefly describe the operational concept on how the system
   will be deployed and address the roles of both Active and Reserve units if differences exist.
   Specifically state if the system will be used as a weapon against the enemy since this
   determination affects the combatant status of the operators. The estimate specifies
   requirements for continuous operations and surge and describes environmental conditions or
   other factors that affect manpower determination. (For instance, chemical, biological,
   nuclear, or extreme meteorological conditions require protective clothing, which impede
   performance and increase manpower.) The MER identifies, by FY, echelon, manpower mix
   and DFC, the type and number of units or platforms (wings, squadrons, etc.) receiving the
   systems and the number of systems going to each type of unit or platform. It identifies any
   unprogrammed force structure and plans to store systems in warehouses or temporarily place
   systems in training units if the plans affect the manpower. Plans for the entire life of the
   system, to include the planned transfer of the system from the active to ARC shall be
   addressed. The estimate will address whether, during a crisis or war, operational units will
   be located in areas where the risk of hostile fire or collateral damage is high, since these
   determinations affect manpower mix.

       Plan (WMP) 8.1.
   A8.1.3. Maintenance Concept. Include a brief description of the maintenance concept for
   both the hardware and software and address intermediate and depot support. The estimate
   will identify maintenance support elements by echelon, manpower mix and DFC that are
   required during peacetime and war, to include in-theater depot support elements required
   during war. It specifies if, during a crisis or war, any of the maintenance support elements
   will be located in areas where the risk of hostile fire or collateral damage is high. Analysts
   verify whether equipment kept in storage require maintenance and if the workload is
   significant enough to require additional manpower. The MER indicates whether the system
   requires a “core logistics capability” as defined in Title 10 United States Code, Section 2464.
   Plans for the entire life of the system, to include the planned transfer of systems from the
   active to ARC must be addressed. Plans for interim or life cycle contract support will be
   specified once the manpower mix has been determined. It indicates if the contract services
   are “mission essential” as defined in DoDI 3020.37, Continuation of Essential DoD
   Contractor Services During Crises. The estimate also addresses whether the maintenance
   concept represents a significant departure from how comparable contemporary systems are
   maintained. The following are examples of comments that could be used to explain
   requirements.
       A8.1.3.1. Base-level equipment maintenance performed at main operating bases.
       A8.1.3.2. Maintenance at forward operating bases limited to equipment repair.
       A8.1.3.3. Two-level maintenance concept employed to extent possible.
       A8.1.3.4. A decision tree analysis or depot maintenance inter-service process used to
       determine depot-level maintenance source of repair.
   A8.1.4. Support Concept. The MER must address requirements for supply, repair parts
   distribution, security, BOS, life-cycle system management, warehousing, disposal,
   environmental clean-up and other support. It identifies direct support elements by echelon,
   manpower mix and DFC that are required during peacetime and wartime over the life of the
   system. Ratios may be used to estimate indirect support, to include BOS, disposal and
   environmental clean-up. Unique transportation, intelligence mapping, charting and geodesy
   requirements and personnel security clearance requirements must be addressed if they require
   manpower increases. The MER also addresses whether, during a crisis or war, support
   elements are located in areas where the risk of hostile fire or collateral damage is high. Plans
   for interim or life-cycle contract support are specified once the manpower mix has been
   determined. The MER indicates if the contract services are “mission essential” as defined in
AFI38-201 30 JANUARY 2014                                                                        117


   DoDI 3020.37. It addresses plans for the entire life of the system, to include the planned
   transfer of systems from active to ARC. The estimate will also address whether the support
   concept represents a significant departure from what is required by comparable contemporary
   systems.
   A8.1.5. Training Concept. The MER will briefly summarize the training concept and
   address the extent to which the system will rely on training devices, simulators, or embedded
   training. This description covers unit, collective and joint training. The MER identifies by
   FY, echelon, manpower mix and DFC, the types and number of training activities (e.g.,
   schoolhouse and training units) receiving the training systems and the number of systems
   going to each type of training activity. It identifies training units that are assigned a training
   mission during peacetime but have operational missions during wartime. Civilian training
   will be addressed if the workload is significant enough to require additional manpower.
   Plans for interim or life cycle contract training will be specified once the manpower mix is
   determined. The MER indicates if the contract services are “mission essential” as defined in
   DoD Instruction 3020.37. Also, additional requirements that result from the planned transfer
   of systems from the active to ARC will be reported. The MER shall address whether the
   training approach for the new system differs from training required for comparable
   contemporary systems. Following are examples of comments that could be used to explain
   requirements.
      A8.1.5.1. Instructional System Development analysis used to determine maintenance
      training requirements and equipment.
      A8.1.5.2. Training conducted at technical training locations and field training
      detachments.
      A8.1.5.3. Primary aircrew training conducted by an active duty training squadron with
      xx PAA.
