   4.1. Alarm/Notification. When an alarm is sounded or a mass notification is made,
   evacuate the building. All personnel, with the exception of those deemed essential for the
   purpose of securing classified areas, will evacuate to their assembly area. The last person out
   of each office shall close, but NOT LOCK, the door (except areas with classified
   information). Lights, computers, etc., may remain on.
       4.1.1. Actual Fires. If an actual fire is confirmed, or if directed by the Base Fire
       Department or other emergency services, all personnel will evacuate and report to the
       assembly area immediately. If the Base Fire Department is not on the scene when the fire
       is verified, the Ops Center must ensure any members remaining in classified areas are
       notified to exit the building immediately.
   4.2. Essential personnel. Will immediately begin taking steps to prepare for final
   evacuation (e.g., securing all classified information). Classified materials will be handled in
   accordance with AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management as well procedures
   in AFWA OIs/Emergency Action Plan.
       4.2.1. Essential personnel should complete final evacuation procedures and notify the
       Ops Center upon evacuation of their area. If the Ops Center cannot be notified, these
       personnel should proceed directly to the assembly area and report to the senior-ranking
       person to let him/her know they are out.
   4.3. Personnel. Will report to the senior-ranking person from their work center at the
   assembly area and remain there unless dismissed.
       4.3.1. Senior-ranking personnel from each duty section, working through their chain of
       command, will inform the overall senior ranking person of any personnel unaccounted
       for in each assembly area. When reporting, they will provide the names of anyone from
       their work center remaining in the building or unaccounted for.
       4.3.2. The senior-ranking person or designated POC at the assembly area will report to
       the AFWA EM Team Member wearing the reflective vest or belt. The EM Team
       Member will contact the Ops Center, 294-2586 option 1, by sending two runners to call
       from the closest building not involved in the incident. Personal cell phones may be used
       instead, if desired. The person making the call will give the Ops Center their phone
 6                                                                   AFWAI32-8 28 JULY 2010


        number and ask for a return phone call when the incident is over or when further
        instructions are required. That person will then stand-by the phone and use the second
        runner to relay information back to the senior-ranking person. (Note: If Ops Center is
        evacuated they may be contacted by cell phone at 402-659-6815).
        4.3.3. Personnel will remain outside of Building 185 until the fire department declares it
        safe to return.
     4.4. All Directors/Commanders. Must ensure any physically challenged members in their
     respective areas safely exit the building with an escort and follow the information for
     reporting in para. 4.3. This includes temporarily disabled personnel (e.g. recent foot surgery)
     who might be unable to quickly climb or descend stairs. Wheelchair routes will be identified
     for all affected personnel within a section.
     4.5. Fire Alarm Maintenance. In the event of fire alarm maintenance, the Ops Center will
     make a PA announcement that fire alarms may sound in certain areas and should be
     disregarded.
5. Bomb Threat/Scare. Each telephone throughout AFWA will have an AF Form 440, Bomb
Threat Aid, located within reach to use in the event of a bomb threat. In addition, personnel are
to take the following actions if a bomb threat is received:
     5.1. Step 1. Listen – do not interrupt the caller.
     5.2. Step 2. Do not attempt to transfer the call to another section or party. Stay on the line
     with the caller and get as many details as possible.
     5.3. Step 3. Be observant of any identifying traits the caller may have and make note of any
     background noises or identifiers which may reveal location of the caller.
     5.4. Step 4. Get the attention of another person near by and give them a note stating:
     ―CALL 911 – BOMB THREAT‖. Do not use a cellular phone or a two-way radio to make
     the notifications or use the building fire alarm system to evacuate the building, as this could
     cause a detonation and explosion.
     5.5. Step 5. Stay on the line and ask the caller:
        5.5.1. When will the bomb go off?
        5.5.2. Where is it located or has it been placed?
        5.5.3. What does it look like or how is it packaged?
        5.5.4. Why is the caller doing this?
        5.5.5. Who is he/she?
        5.5.6. How will it go off?
     5.6. Step 6. Notify the Ops Center, 294-2586 option 1 (or send a runner), immediately. Do
     not use a cellular phone or a two-way radio as this could cause detonation or explosion.
     5.7. Step 7. The Ops Center will determine a safe route to evacuate, avoiding sending
     personnel in the vicinity of the suspected bomb.
AFWAI32-8 28 JULY 2010                                                                           7


   5.8. Step 8. Directors/Commanders will establish and maintain a clear zone around the
   building as far away from the entrances and exits as possible. Forward all information to
   ECC via 911.
   5.9. Step 9. All AFWA personnel will evacuate the building when told of a bomb threat,
   using the safe route(s) and assembly area(s) identified by the Ops Center. Ensure all
   physically disabled members safely exit the building with an escort. This includes
   temporarily disabled personnel (e.g., recent foot surgery) who might be unable to quickly
   climb or descend stairs.
6. Suspicious Packages/Parcels. In the event a suspicious package is found in the building,
adjacent buildings, parking lot, etc., take the following actions:
   6.1. Step 1. Do not touch, move, or otherwise disturb the package.
   6.2. Step 2. Notify Ops Center, 294-2586 option 1 (or send a runner), to contact security
   forces. Do not use cellular phone or two-way radio as this could cause detonation or
   explosion of the package.
   6.3. Step 3. Ops center will contact all occupants in the building and adjacent buildings and
   direct them away from the location of the package and immediately evacuate the area.
   6.4. Step 4. Do not use a cellular phone or a two-way radio to make the notifications or use
   the building fire alarm system to evacuate the building, as this could cause a detonation and
   explosion.
7. Severe Weather Procedures. Severe thunderstorms and tornadoes can affect Offutt AFB
during any season of the year. It is important that all building 185 occupants are aware of
protective measures to take when severe weather threatens.
   7.1. Watches. Weather watches indicate the potential for severe weather conditions to exist.
   When Offutt AFB is under a severe weather watch, personnel need to be aware of the
   possible severe weather conditions and be prepared to take the action required to protect life
   and property.
       7.1.1. A high wind or hail watch indicates the potential for severe thunderstorms with
       strong winds and/or damaging hail. When thunderstorms threaten, personnel will remain
       alert to changing weather conditions and prepare to take personal protective measures.
       7.1.2. A tornado watch indicates the potential for tornadoes. Personnel will remain alert
       to changing weather conditions and prepare to take shelter in a designated tornado
       shelter. See attachments 7 and 8.
   7.2. Warnings. Weather warnings are issued to indicate that severe weather conditions
   exist. The Ops Center will notify personnel via email of all weather warnings.
       7.2.1. A high wind or hail warning indicates storms of strong winds and/or damaging
       hail exist. Remain indoors and away from windows. If caught outdoors, find shelter
       immediately. A sturdy building is the safest place to be during a severe thunderstorm.
       Avoid unprotected gazebos, trees, rain or picnic shelters, golf carts, baseball dugouts, and
       bleachers. While many people take shelter from rain in these locations, they are often
       isolated structures in otherwise open areas; therefore, a target for lightning. In addition,
       gazebos and picnic shelters are often poorly anchored and subject to being uprooted and
 8                                                                    AFWAI32-8 28 JULY 2010


        blown around in strong thunderstorm winds. Also, they offer little protection from large
        hail.
        7.2.2. A tornado warning is signaled by a 3 - 5 minute steady tone from the base sirens
        and indicates that a tornado has been spotted or has been indicated by radar. The 55
        WG/CP and AFWA Ops Center will notify personnel via the mass notification system, an
        e-mail of the impending tornado threat, and a pop up message on computer systems with
        acknowledgement required. Personnel within Building 185 will evacuate to the nearest
        tornado safe area immediately. Upon arrival in the shelter, the senior ranking individual
        will follow the instruction in section 4.3 to report accountability of their people. (See
        attachments 7 and 8, AFWA Tornado Shelter Visual Aid also available on the AFWA
        publications home page). If caught outdoors, in a car or a mobile home, personnel should
        take cover in the nearest building, preferably with an underground shelter. Avoid places
        with wide-span roofs, such as auditoriums, cafeterias, large hallways, or shopping malls.
        If there is no building nearby, crouch low in a low spot. Use your arms and hands to
        protect your head.
8. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRNE) Attack. A CBRNE
attack is signaled by a 3 - 5 minute wavering tone from the base sirens, and will be announced
via AFWA’s mass notification system. When warned of a CBRNE attack, personnel within
Building 185 will evacuate to the nearest Shelter-In-Place (SIP) (see attachment 9). Personnel
will remain in the SIP areas until further instruction is received by the emergency action team.
SIP kits are available in each location near the doors in plastic containers. Instructions are within.
9. Injury or Illness.
     9.1. Step 1. In life-threatening situations, call 911 and provide the dispatcher with as much
     pertinent information as time allows, such as:
        9.1.1. Location of the victim.
        9.1.2. Type of illness/injury sustained.
        9.1.3. Whether or not victim is breathing.
        9.1.4. Whether or not victim is conscious.
        9.1.5. Whether or not victim is bleeding.
     9.2. Step 2. Attempt to stabilize victim.
        9.2.1. Administer first aid.
        9.2.2. If trained, administer Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) if victim is not
        breathing.
        9.2.3. Do not move victim unless there is a potential for loss of life (e.g., burning
        building).
        9.2.4. Brief emergency services upon arrival at the scene of the situation.
     9.3. Step 3. In non life-threatening events, provide immediate self-aid buddy care, then
     contact Base Clinic, 232-2273, and provide the operator with all pertinent information.
     Follow instructions provided by the Base Clinic and notify the Ops Center if emergency
     services will be entering the building. Contact the AFWA safety office and provide the

   location of the victim and the type of injury/illness. See AFWA’s safety bulletin board on the
   first floor (east corridor) for latest Unit Safety Representative Information.
