standard of cleanliness and order expected of military installations.

2. Specific Responsibilities. The following specific responsibilities are assigned for
maintaining the base in proper order and appearance:
     2.1. Main Base Area:
        2.1.1. Group commanders will enforce procedures for grounds policing and grounds
        keeping within their area of responsibility (AOR) (refer to Attachments 2 through 6,
        maps identifying all groups, the 366th Operations Group (366 OG), the 366th
        Maintenance Group (366 MXG), the 366th Mission Support Group (366 MSG), and the
        366th Medical Group (366 MDG) AOR for common area cleanup). Activate grounds
        policing procedures as often as necessary to maintain a neat and orderly appearance.
        Group senior enlisted managers and facility managers are the primary focal points to
        ensure grounds adjacent to their facility is kept free of tumbleweeds, down tree limbs,
        etc., after each windstorm and/or natural disaster.
     2.2. Family Housing (FH):
        2.2.1. AOR for housing occupants. IAW MHAFB Instruction (MHAFBI) 32-6004,
        Inspection Standards for Military Family Housing, occupants assigned AOR is midway
        between adjoining units and/or to the center of the street. If there is no adjoining unit, it
        is 2 feet beyond your backyard fence line, or 50 feet from your dwelling or to the nearest
        common area. Personnel accepting quarters with a corner lot are responsible for the
        entire seeded/rocked area regardless of the location of your fence. The grounds
        maintenance contractor is responsible for areas beyond 50 feet from the nearest dwelling
        or common areas. Occupants should not only maintain their lawns/flower beds/rocked
        areas, but use all available products and resources from the Self-Help Store, at no
        expense to them, to continually improve their yard each year. Specific grounds keeping
        responsibilities for residents are identified in the base housing brochure given to each
        resident upon assignment of quarters by the 366th Civil Engineer Squadron, Housing
        Management Office (366 CES/CEAC).
        2.2.2. Residents are responsible for complying with the following guidelines regarding
        their AORs:
           2.2.2.1. General yard appearance. Do not store or park junked or inoperative
           vehicles, (e.g., recreational vehicles (RV), campers, boats or pickup toppers) in the
           FH area. Do not park RVs anywhere in the housing area for more than 5 consecutive
           days without written authorization from 366 CES/CEAC IAW MHAFBI 31-101,
           Installation Defense (ID) Instruction. Do not perform extensive maintenance on
           vehicles in the FH area. 366 CES/CEAC will issue citations for violators who do not
           maintain their yards in a neat and orderly fashion and have an abundance of trash or
           animal feces.
           2.2.2.2. Winter yard care. Remove dead vegetation and leaf accumulation in the fall
           and winter, and remove all snow and ice from driveways and sidewalks.
           2.2.2.3. Summer yard care. During the growing season (March through October),
           FH occupants will ensure yards are in compliance with MHAFBI 32-6004. As a
           minimum, mow, edge and trim weekly to accommodate Tuesday and Friday lawn
           inspections. Yards must be green and well manicured. Flower and rock beds must be
           free of weeds.

  2.3. 366 CES/CEAC will routinely inspect FH areas.
  2.4. Green Machine responsibilities:
     2.4.1. Common area cleanup, locally referred to as “Green Machine,” will include the
     entire base (refer to Attachments 2 through 6 for assignment of AORs).
     2.4.2. The 366th Fighter Wing Commander (366 FW/CC) or designated representative
     will initiate a semiannual base-wide cleanup. Group commanders or designated
     representatives will inform each unit commander to assemble all their military personnel,
     provide the necessary instructions and ensure personnel, under their immediate control,
     possess the proper personal protective equipment and tools to effectively clear all debris
     from their assigned AOR.
        2.4.2.1. 366 CES/CEOHP (Pavements and Equipment Shop) provides curbside
        pickup and is responsible for collecting bagged trash in the dumpsters along
        Gunfighter Avenue and/or Liberator Street.
        2.4.2.2. Take tumbleweeds directly to the burn ditch adjacent to Fam Camp using
        unit government-owned vehicles. For an excessive amount of tumbleweeds contact
        366 CES/CEOSC (Customer Service Office) at 828-2001. 366 CES will provide a
        dump truck and driver, and AOR manpower will load the truck.
     2.4.3. Reasons to initiate Green Machine. Distinguished visitor visits, before and after
     special events such as air shows, and windstorms.
     2.4.4. Group commanders may institute a local Green Machine at any time within their
     AOR as they deem appropriate.
