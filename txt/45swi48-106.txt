This instruction implements the respiratory protection requirements of Air Force Occupational Safety and
Health (AFOSH) Standard 48-137, Respiratory Protection Program, and 29 Code of Federal Regulation
(CFR)1910.134, Respiratory Protection Program (RPP). It establishes policies and practices for protec-
tion of active duty Air Force personnel, civilian Department of Defense employees, US Air Force
Reserve, and the Air National Guard units for the 45th Space Wing (45 SW) and Cape Canaveral Air
Force Station (CCAFS). The 45 SW’s Respiratory Protection Program is administered by the 45th Aero-
medical-Dental Squadron (45 ADOS), Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight (BEF) (45 ADOS/SGGB).
The NASA/AF Joint Base Operational Support Contractor (JBOSC) administers and acts as operational
consultants on applicable portions of this instruction at CCAFS.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

tection Program. It updates references and corrects administrative errors. Additionally, sections of the
document that were duplicative to AFOSH Std 48-137 were deleted. A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from

1. Policy.
   1.1. Respirator Use at 45 SW and CCAFS.
       1.1.1. Each worker enrolled in the Respiratory Protection Program must be medically cleared for
       respirator use prior to wearing a respirator. Medical examination requirements, as determined by
       the Aerospace Medicine Council (AMC), will ensure the worker can safely use respiratory protec-
       tion equipment.

       1.1.2. Workers who are required or recommended by the 45 ADOS/SGGB and/or JBOSC to wear
       respirators will be enrolled in the 45 SW Respiratory Protection Program. 45 ADOS/SGGB will
       select the type of respirator required based on hazard evaluations.
       1.1.3. The 45 ADOS/SGGB will provide initial training to supervisors who oversee work activi-
       ties of one or more persons who must wear respirators at Patrick AFB, Florida. Training will be
       repeated when a new supervisor is assigned to a workplace or a supervisor moves to a different
       workplace. Documentation of training will be made on AF Form 55, Employee Safety and
       Health Record, or equivalent computerized training records.
       1.1.4. Gas permeable and soft contact lenses may be worn with respirators at the individual’s
       expense. Vision correction inserts for full-face respirators will be purchased by the government
       with a user-provided prescription.
       1.1.5. Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve personnel who have duties that require respira-
       tory protection at Patrick AFB shall be enrolled in the Respiratory Protection Program. They will
       be trained and fit-tested by BEF personnel initially and annually. Medical exams are required, and
       may be provided by the member’s unit if approved by the AMC.
       1.1.6. Other personnel (civilian DoD personnel and military) deployed to Patrick AFB, CCAFS,
       Antigua/ Ascension facilities or downrange sites who are performing duties that require respira-
       tory protection must comply with AFOSH Std 48-137.
       1.1.7. Contractors. These requirements and procedures do not apply to government-owned, con-
       tractor-operated (GOCO) operations. All contractors will comply with respiratory protection IAW
       29 CFR 1910.134.
       1.1.8. Tenants. DoD tenants will comply with the requirements set forth in this instruction unless
       their specific organization’s policies are more stringent. A copy of all procedures or joint tenant
       agreements will be provided to 45 ADOS/SGGB.
