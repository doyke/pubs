SUMMARY OF REVISIONS: Document is revised and needs to be completely reviewed. This
instruction implements AFPD 13-2, Air Traffic Control, Airspace, Airfield, and Range
Management. It establishes procedures and requirements for airfield operations. The procedures
established in this instruction apply to host, tenant, and transient agencies using airfield facilities
at Kirtland AFB, including Reserve and Guard units. All runways and taxiways (unless
otherwise noted) are owned by the city and for the purpose of this instruction, the term “airfield”
denotes pavement owned/maintained by Kirtland AFB (KAFB).
