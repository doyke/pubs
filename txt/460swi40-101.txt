This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 40-1, Health Promotion, Federal
Register, Volume 66, Number 100, 23 May 2001, Guidelines for Public Access Defibrillation
Programs in Federal Facilities and establishes the Public Access Defibrillation (PAD) program
for Buckley Air Force Base. The program provides for Automated External Defibrillators
(AED) to be placed in strategic locations on the installation to allow access by trained
individuals to use in reviving personnel during certain cardiac crises prior to arrival of medical
personnel. It applies to all military, Department of Defense (DoD) civilian personnel, and tenant
unit employees who are identified in paragraphs 1.1. through 1.6. of this instruction. It identifies
responsibilities, maintenance, quality assurance, and documentation requirements. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to 460th Medical Group Chief of
Medical Staff (460 MDG/SGH), 275 S. Aspen St, Stop 89, Buckley AFB, CO 80011-9562, using
the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF IMTs 847 from the field
through the base publications/forms manager (460 SCS/SCOKP). Ensure that all records created
as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN

   responsibility for the PAD program. The 460 SW/CC directs the 460th Medical Group
2                                                                460SWI40-101 30 JULY 2009


    Commander (460 MDG/CC) to ensure proper medical objectives are maintained for the PAD
    program.
    1.2. 460 MDG/CC .         The 460 MDG/CC is responsible to the 460 SW/CC for
    implementation of the PAD program. Ensures all medical objectives are maintained and
    provides professional guidance on program administration. Appoints in writing a medical
    director and program coordinator for the PAD program.
    1.3. 460 MDG Medical Director. The PAD medical director will be a physician, IAW
    Colorado State Law, Colorado AED Limited Immunity Statute 13-21-108.1. The PAD
    medical director is responsible for providing oversight for training, emergency medical
    services coordination, protocols, standing orders, and formulation of AED deployment
    strategies. The PAD medical director will review or have a designated representative, review
    all event summary sheets (Attachment 1) within 5 days of AED use. It is acceptable for
    base facilities to have medical oversight arranged through other local avenues, if they comply
    with Colorado State Law and coordinate with the Fire Chief (460 CES/CEF) at Buckley
    AFB.
    1.4. Medical Maintenance. The 460th Medical Group Medical Maintenance will serve as
    the point of contact for site coordinators and the manufacturer representatives concerning any
    problems with AEDs. Medical Maintenance will be responsible for annual inspections and
    equipment inventory, as well as any maintenance beyond the site coordinator’s ability to
    accomplish using the manufacturer owner’s manual. Medical Maintenance will ensure the
    site coordinators are maintaining the AEDs in accordance with the owner’s manual
    recommendations. The 460 MDG Medical Maintenance will have one loaner AED available
    for areas needing advanced maintenance on their unit. The 460 MDG Medical Maintenance
    can help site coordinators with re-order part numbers and will maintain an inventory of all
    base AEDs.
    1.5. Site Coordinators. The PAD site coordinators will, at a minimum, be trained in basic
    life support and appointed in writing by the squadron commander or supervisor responsible
    for the area in which the AED will be located. Site coordinators will be responsible for
    AEDs located within their area of responsibility and will ensure all required inspections and
    maintenance actions are accomplished in accordance with the manufacturer’s manual. They
    will complete the AED checklist (Attachment 2) and submit to the 460th Medical Group
    Medical Maintenance Journeyman. The PAD site coordinators will contact their unit supply
    custodian when replacement supplies are needed. AED supplies and/or replacement AEDs
    will be ordered through 460th Medical Support Squadron Medical Logistics (460
    MDSS/SGSL) (DSN 847-6480) through an account created and funded by the respective
    unit. The PAD site coordinators will notify Medical Maintenance (DSN 847-6072) with any
    change of location of the unit or problems with the unit. Site coordinators will ensure there
    are enough targeted responders for their building so that it will be likely that a targeted
    responder will be available at their AED locations during duty hours. They will ensure the
    targeted responders are trained in CPR and AEDs and that the targeted responders review
    CPR and AED skills annually (in between the biannual certification courses).
    1.6. Targeted Responders. Each unit with an AED will select individuals to be targeted
    responders. Those individuals identified as targeted responders will be trained in Adult CPR
    with AED by 460th Medical Group Education and Training (460 MDG/SGSF), or American
460SWI40-101 30 JULY 2009                                                                      3


   Heart Association CPR and AED training approved by the 460 MDG/SGSF. Targeted
   responders will notify the PAD site coordinator when an event occurs so the appropriate
   event log can be filed and replacement supplies may be ordered.
2. Event Procedures. The responding individual will complete an event summary sheet
(Attachment 1) when an AED is used on a victim. The form will be delivered (preferably hand
carried) to 460 MDG/SGH within 48 hours. The AED will be turned into Medical Maintenance,
(DSN 847-6072) for maintenance within 48 hours. A loaner AED will be issued to replace the
area’s unit while maintenance is performed.
3. Quality Assurance, AED Procurement and AED Location Determination. The medical
director or designee will review all event summary sheets to assess quality of care. The medical
director will consult with the fire chief, security forces commander and base safety to determine
the best locations for AEDs based on historical EMS data and population distribution throughout
the base. Requests for additional AED locations should be submitted through 460 MDG Medical
Maintenance using Attachment 2.
4. Legal Issues. The Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S. Code § 1346(b), 2671-80, (FTCA)
immunizes Federal employees acting within the scope of their employment from personal
liability for most tortious conduct. Employees whose use of a public access or automated
external defibrillator (AED) is outside the scope of their employment may be eligible for federal
representation, but could be personally liable for any harm that results from the use of the AED.
Under the FTCA, the Federal government is not liable for the wrongful acts of any person who is
not a “federal employee” defined in 28 U.S. Code § 2671. Under the FTCA the United States is
not liable for the wrongful acts of government contractors. Thus public access defibrillation
program participants should not be contractors. Colorado does have a “Good Samaritan” statute
to immunize personnel from civil liability, who in good faith render emergency care and
assistance, without compensation, to include the use of an AED, even if such persons have not
undergone the training required.

I understand that a reasonable number of employees in my building should be trained in Basic

responder will be on site during business hours. I am aware of the need for all targeted
responders to maintain BLS and AED training certificates. Initials_____

I have decided that we will keep _____ employees trained in BLS with AED for this building. I
will ensure that these employees keep their training current (take BLS with AED training every
two years). I will replace employees as needed to keep ____ employees trained in BLS with
AED. Initials______

I have received a maintenance checklist from 460th Medical Group Medical Maintenance and
have been instructed on how to maintain a Public AED binder. (Document in binder names of
BLS/AED trained individuals, annual practice mock use of AED with BLS, inspection and
documentation of AED supplies). Initials____

I will ensure needed supplies are with the AED (currently non-latex protective gloves, CPR
mask, disposable razor, bandage scissors, spare electrode pads, biohazard medical waste bag,
event summary sheet, pen and absorbent towel). Initials_______

I am aware of event summary sheet. Initials_______
