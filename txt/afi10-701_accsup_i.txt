SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This updated
instruction adds responsibilities for MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs (paragraph 1.4.8), Air Combat
Command (ACC) (paragraph 1.4.8), commanders (paragraph 1.4.15), requirement to budget,
acquire and distribute OPSEC awareness and education materials (1.4.15.8.2), OPSEC Program
Managers (PM), Signature Management Officers, Coordinators and Planners (paragraph 1.4.16)
and all Air Force personnel (paragraph 1.4.17). Chapter 2 has been renamed Signature
Management and OPSEC Process has been moved to Chapter 4. OPSEC measures have been
deleted from chapter 4 and are now reflected to read countermeasures (paragraph 4.6).
Acquisition planning has been removed from chapter 3, OPSEC Planning and placed within
chapter 8, OPSEC Contract Requirements. OPSEC Awareness Education and Training has been
moved to chapter 5, OPSEC Education and Training, and includes requirement to provide
awareness information to AF family members. OPSEC assessments has been moved to chapter
6 and titled Assessments. Additions to chapter 6 include web site link to the OPSEC Core
Capabilities Checklists (paragraph 6.1.5), requirements regarding the assessment of information
on AF public and private web sites (paragraph 6.5), and requirement to utilize the operations
security collaborations architecture (OSCAR) tool for annual assessments (paragraph 6.6.4). Air
Force OPSEC annual awards is located in chapter 7 and chapter 8 includes information regarding
OPSEC as a requirement within government contracts.

(ACC) This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major
changes include: clarification of OPSEC program requirements for all echelons of ACC units
with the basic tenant being that all ACC units/personnel, at all levels of command, must plan and
implement the OPSEC process. It specifies host-tenant relationships and MOA requirements for
AFI10-701_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                                                                        3


specifying details of their working relationships and mutual OPSEC supporting activities.
Commander, Program Manager (PM, Signature Management Officer‘s, and Coordinators
responsibilities are defined/clarified to ensure effective OPSEC program implementation,
management, and execution. OPSEC products are required to ensure the full process is
executed. Following the addition of Signature Management (SM) in the AFI 10-701 this
supplement integrates SM guidance and provides SM templates for standardization across the
command. For this document all references to C-NAF include all the components under the
commander. A C-NAF typically consists of an Air Force Forces (AFFOR) staff (command
element, A1- A9, and Personal Staff), an AOC and all other forces assigned or attached to the
Component Commander. It may also have an assigned support group / squadron with
streamlined overhead to provide organizational control over required support units.

                                           Chapter 1

                                          GENERAL

1.1. Introduction: OPSEC is a military capability within Information Operations (IO). IO is
the integrated employment of three operational elements: influence operations (IFO), electronic
warfare operations and network warfare operations. IO aims to influence, disrupt, corrupt, or
usurp adversarial human or automated decision-making while protecting our own. IFO employs
the military capabilities of military information support operations (MISO), OPSEC, military
deception (MILDEC), counterintelligence operations, public affairs (PA) operations and
counterpropaganda operations to affect behaviors, protect operations, communicate
commanders‘ intent and project accurate information to achieve desired effects across the
operational environment. OPSEC‘s desired effect is to influence the adversary‘s behavior and
actions by protecting friendly operations and activities.
1.2. Operational Context:
     1.2.1. Operational Focus. The OPSEC program is an operations function or activity and its
     goals are information superiority and optimal mission effectiveness. The emphasis is on
     OPERATIONS and the assurance of effective mission accomplishment. To ensure effective
     implementation across organizational and functional lines the organization‘s OPSEC
     Program Manager (PM), Signature Management Officer (SMO), or coordinator will reside in
     the operations and/or plans element of an organization or report directly to the commander.
     For those organizations with no traditional operations or plans element, the commander must
     decide the most logical area to place management and coordination of the organization‘s
     OPSEC program while focusing on operations and the mission of the organization. Figure
     1.2 illustrates the AF OPSEC functional structure.

Figure 1.1. OPSEC Functional Structure
AFI10-701_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                             7


   1.2.2. Operational effectiveness is enhanced when commanders and other decision-makers
   apply OPSEC from the earliest stages of planning. OPSEC involves a series of analyses to
   examine the planning, preparation, execution and post execution phases of any operation or
   activity across the entire spectrum of military action and in any operational environment.
   OPSEC analysis provides decision-makers with a means of weighing how much risk they
   are willing to accept in particular operational circumstances in the same way as operations
   risk management allows commanders to assess risk in mission planning.
   1.2.3. OPSEC must be closely integrated and synchronized with other IFO capabilities,
   security disciplines, and all aspects of protected operations (see references listed in
   Attachment 1).
1.3. Purpose:
   1.3.1. The purpose of OPSEC is to reduce the vulnerability of Air Force missions by
   eliminating or reducing successful adversary collection and exploitation of critical
   information. OPSEC applies to all activities that prepare, sustain, or employ forces during all
   phases of operations.
   1.3.2. OPSEC Definition. OPSEC is a process of identifying, analyzing and controlling
   critical information indicating friendly actions associated with military operations and other
   activities to:
       1.3.2.1. Identify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems.
       1.3.2.2. Determine what specific indications could be collected, analyzed, and
       interpreted to derive critical information in time to be useful to adversaries.
       1.3.2.3. Select and execute measures that eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the
       vulnerabilities of friendly actions to adversary exploitation.
1.4. Roles and Responsibilities:
   1.4.1. Air Force organizations must develop and integrate OPSEC into their mission
   planning to ensure critical information and indicators are identified. At a minimum, the Air
   Force will integrate OPSEC into the following missions: military strategy, operational and
   tactical planning and execution, military indoctrination, support activities, contingency,
   combat and peacetime operations and exercises, communications-computer architectures and
   processing, critical infrastructure protection, weapons systems, Research, Development, Test
   and Evaluation (RDT&E), Air Force specialized training, inspections, acquisition and
   procurement, medical operations and professional military education. Although the OPSEC
   program helps commanders make and implement decisions, the decisions are the
   commander‘s responsibility. Commanders must understand the risk to the mission and then
   determine which countermeasures are required.
   1.4.2. The Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, Plans and Requirements
   (AF/A3/5). The AF/A3/5 is the OPR for implementing DoD OPSEC policy and guidance.
   This responsibility is assigned to the Director of Cyber and Space Operations (AF/A3Z).
   AF/A3Z will:
       1.4.2.1. Establish an AF OPSEC program focused on senior leadership involvement
       using the management tools of assessments, surveys, training, education, threat analyses,
       resourcing, and awareness that, at a minimum, includes:

     1.4.8.1. (ACC) Each ACC C-NAF, DRU, and FOA will implement and maintain their
     own OPSEC program IAW AFI 10-701 and guidance from ACC/A3IF. Commanders
     with multiple ―hats‖ may appoint a primary and alternate PM that covers multiple
     organizations if the mission allows. For example, while in garrison 12AF, 612
     AOC/AFFOR can have a single program as long as the commander states so in the
     appointment letter. If deployed, the organization needs to maintain OPSEC programs at
     both the deployed and in-garrison location. (see Attachment 2: OPSEC Program
     Manager for ACC C-NAF and DRUs Appointment Letter Template)

     (billets) are assigned the OPSEC special experience identifier (SEI) 9O or 234. All
     individuals performing OPSEC duties will be awarded SEI 9O or 234 when all
     requirements are met and approval granted by the commander and/or appropriate AFPC
     assignment managers. SEIs will drive future training allocations upon receipt of orders
     or upon assignment to organizations with SEI coded positions.
     1.4.8.15. Develop and cultivate the intelligence and counterintelligence relationships
     necessary to support OPSEC programs.

14                                           AFI10-701_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2012


  have an OPSEC program. OPSEC PMs at the C-NAF level have responsibilities to include
  OPSEC considerations in operational planning, to provide policy and guidance for
  subordinate organizations (e.g. assigned Air Expeditionary Wings), and to implement the
  OPSEC process to protect critical information across the staff. For installations with multiple
  units, all wing and above commanders, and geographically separated Group commanders
  will have their own OPSEC program that is tailored to their mission in addition to
  participating in the installation OPSEC process led by the host unit. This is especially
  important for those units that deploy separately from the host unit.
     1.4.15.1. Issue guidance regarding the establishment of OPSEC measures to all assigned
     personnel to ensure OPSEC is integrated into day-to-day and contingency operations.
     Commanders may delegate authority for OPSEC program management, but retain
     responsibility for risk management decisions and the overall implementation of
     countermeasures. They must determine the balance between countermeasures and
     operational needs.
     1.4.15.2. Appoint in writing a primary and alternate OPSEC PM, or coordinator and
     forward to the next higher headquarters (HHQ) OPSEC PM. OPSEC PMs will be
     assigned for a minimum of two years, or as area tour length dictates (remote tours only).
     Organizations where an assignment is less than two years will request, in writing a
     waiver to their HHQ OPSEC PM.
     1.4.15.2. (ACC) Commanders will appoint OPSEC PMs to serve a minimum of two
     years to ensure the health of the OPSEC program and to maximize training investments.
     Waivers will not be granted lightly. Unit commander endorsed waiver requests will be
     submitted to ACC/A3I for consideration. (see Attachment 6 Sample Waiver Memo).
     Approved waivers will be retained on file with HQ ACC/A3I. Unit OPSEC PM will file
     a copy of the approved waiver in their OPSEC continuity book (See Attachment 7). For
     OPSEC PMs required to attend the AF Signature Management (SM) Course, the unit may
     be required to fund training for newly appointed PMs when the previous OPSEC PM
     departs or is re-assigned to other duties prior to the minimum two-year requirement.
     Appointment letters will clearly state to which organization(s) the PM is appointed. (See
     Attachment 4: Signature Management Officer Appointment Letter Template;
     Attachment 2:         OPSEC Program Manager for ACC C-NAF and DRUs
     Appointment Letter Template); and Attachment 5: OPSEC Coordinator
     Appointment Letter Template for below wing level and HQ directorates.) For
     example, the commander can appoint a PM for 9AF HQ, AFCENT and AFFOR/AOC but
     if it is not specified on the appointment letter additional PMs need to be assigned to
     ensure all parts of the organization are under an OPSEC program.
         1.4.15.2.1. Wing or installation primary OPSEC PMs will be an O-3 or above,
         civilian equivalent, or an E-7. The alternate OPSEC PM will be an E-6 or above, or
         civilian equivalent. Under no circumstances will contract personnel be appointed as a
         primary or alternate OPSEC PM. At a minimum, OPSEC PMs will have a secret
         clearance (recommend Top Secret).
         1.4.15.2.1. (ACC) Deviation from meeting the minimum rank requirements requires
         HQ ACC/A3I waiver.
             1.4.15.2.1.1. (Added-ACC) Units       commanders/Directors      will   appoint   an
AFI10-701_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                        15


           additional alternate OPSEC PM to ensure effective OPSEC program oversight
           and continuity when the appointed primary or alternate is deployed/TDY for more
           than sixty continuous days. Unit commanders may appoint more than one
           alternate OPSEC PM when unit size and/or mission dictates; however these
           additional individuals must materially contribute to the program‘s administration.
           Appointment letters will document additional OPSEC PM alternates. Note: HAF
           funds may not be available for training more than two OPSEC PMs per unit and
           would require unit funding any additional personnel to attend required SM
           training course.
           1.4.15.2.1.2. (Added-ACC) Ensure continuity of operations by identifying, in
           writing, the replacement OPSEC PM NLT one month prior to the incumbent‘s
           departure from the position. Forward new appointment letter(s) to HQ ACC/A3I
           NLT ten days of the commander signing the appointment letter and before
           incumbent‘s departure (See Attachment 2 OPSEC Program Manager for ACC
           C-NAF and DRUs Appointment Letter Template). OPSEC PM appointment
           letter(s), and two-year waiver request, if required, may be submitted electronically
           via e-mail.
           1.4.15.2.1.3. (Added-ACC) For installations with multiple wings, all ACC
           wings (whether in a host or tenant unit capacity) will have a primary OPSEC PMs
           (known as SMOs in ACC) assigned. The OPSEC PM/SMO will be an O-3 or
           above, civilian equivalent, or an E-7.
           1.4.15.2.1.4. (Added-ACC) For ACC‘s group-level GSU‘s, the OPSEC position
           will be titled as a SMO and will be in the rank of O-3 or above and perform SMO
           equivalent role and responsibilities. All wing-level and SMO requirements
           defined in AFI 10-701 and this supplement apply to these units. Any deviations,
           to include failure to meet minimum rank requirements, require HQ ACC/A3I
           waiver.
        1.4.15.2.2. OPSEC Coordinators can be officers, NCOs or civilian equivalent of any
        grade. OPSEC Coordinators will have a secret clearance.
           1.4.15.2.2.1. (Added-ACC) Appoint OPSEC Coordinators at each HQ ACC/C-
           NAF/USAFWC Directorate and ACC group and/or squadron.                    Unit
           commanders/HQ directorate chiefs (upon advice from the PM/SMOs) may
           require Coordinators below group/HQ directorate level based on mission
           requirements. For example, an Operations group commander with three squadrons
           of the same weapon system may decide that a group-level Coordinator may be
           sufficient to effectively manage OPSEC requirements. However, an Operations
           Group with three disparate weapon systems may require OPSEC Coordinators at
           each of the squadrons and not at the group or at both.
           1.4.15.2.2.2. (Added-ACC) ACC primary and alternate OPSEC Coordinators
           will have a minimum rank of NCO. Unit commanders may appoint more than
           one OPSEC Coordinator via the appointment letter; however these additional
           individuals must materially contribute to the program‘s administration. To ensure
           unit OPSEC program continuity, unit commanders will forward above wing
           OPSEC Coordinator appointment letter to the OPSEC PM and below wing

  1.4.16. OPSEC PMs, Coordinators and Planners: NOTE: Wing and installation SMOs
  will follow the guidance in Chapter 2, Signature Management.
  1.4.16. (ACC) OPSEC PMs, Coordinators and Planners: Wing and Installation SMOs
  will follow the guidance in this section in addition to the requirements in Paragraph 2.3 of
  the AFI and this Supplement.
     1.4.16.1. OPSEC PMs are assigned in writing at organizations above the
     wing/installation level. OPSEC PMs may be assigned to FOAs and DRUs depending on
     their size, need and organizational reporting chain.

     services, such as Air Support Operations Squadrons (ASOS)).                       Local
     commanders/Directorate Chiefs (upon advice from the PM/SMOs) may require
     Coordinators below group/directorate level based on mission requirements. For example,
     in an Ops group that has three squadrons of the same weapon system the SMO may
     decide that a group Coordinator may be sufficient. In an Ops Group with three disparate
     weapon systems the SMO may decide to have Coordinators at each of the squadrons and
     not at the group or at both.      OPSEC Coordinators at HQ ACC/C-NAF/USAFWC
     Directorates will forward a dated, scanned or faxed copy of the signed appointment letter
     to their headquarters OPSEC PM within ten working days of appointment. OPSEC
     Coordinators/SMWG members below wing level will forward a dated, scanned or faxed

        OPSEC PMs they must have a security clearance at the same level as the plans
        created by that unit (minimum Secret). If the organization creates plans at the Top
        Secret level then the OPSEC planner must have a Top Secret clearance to integrate
        OPSEC into the plan at inception.
        1.4.16.3.2. Advise commander or director on all OPSEC and signature management
        related matters to include developing operating instructions, recommending guidance,

        1.4.16.3.3. (ACC) Installations that have multiple organizations assigned will
        establish a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), signed by the host and each tenant
        commander, that specifies host/tenant roles and responsibilities. ACC host wings will
        lead an installation SM (OPSEC/MILDEC) effort; however each ACC wing/wing-
        equivalent and group-level GSU‘s will establish and administer their own tailored SM
        program. For ACC tenant units and group-level GSU‘s on a non-ACC installation,
AFI10-701_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                          19


        the ACC SMO/OPSEC PM will seek out and provide the host SMO with their
        appointment letter, CIL and countermeasures. ACC SMOs will comply with ACC

         1.4.16.3.17. (Added-ACC) Ensure OPSEC Risk Assessment, Threat Analysis,
         Vulnerability Analysis Assessment, and OPSEC Risk Summary Worksheets (see
         AFTTP 3.1 IO, OPSEC Annex) are developed for each operation, activity, and
         exercise whether it be planned, conducted or supported. These documents will be
         kept on file for a minimum of two years (hard or soft copy).
         1.4.16.3.18. (Added-ACC) Ensure OPSEC related briefings or presentations to be
         given outside the MAJCOM are coordinated through the Air Force OPSEC PM,
         AF/A3CI, prior to the presentation date. Send a courtesy copy to ACC/A3I
         concurrently with the HQ AF coordination.
  1.4.17. All Air Force Personnel: OPSEC is everyone‘s responsibility. Ideally, the AF uses
  OPSEC measures to protect its critical information. Failure to properly implement OPSEC
  measures can result in serious injury or death to our personnel; damage to weapons systems,
  equipment and facilities; loss of sensitive technologies; and mission degradation or failure.
  OPSEC is a continuous process and an inherent part of military culture. Failure to implement
  directed OPSEC measures will be considered by commanders/directors for appropriate
  disciplinary action. OPSEC must be fully integrated into the execution of all Air Force
  operations and supporting activities. All AF personnel (active duty, reserve, ANG, Air Force
  civilians, and DoD contractors) will:
     1.4.17.1. Be familiar with their organization‘s critical information.
     1.4.17.2. Protect critical and/or sensitive information from disclosure.
         1.4.17.2.1. When publicly posting or publishing work-related information that
         potentially contains critical or sensitive information airmen are encouraged to solicit
         the advice of their immediate supervisor, security office and/or OPSEC
         PM/SM/coordinator. This will aid in preventing disclosure of critical and/or sensitive
         information within the public domain. Personnel that do not know what information
         is critical to an organization cannot reasonably conclude that posting or publishing
         information will not result in an unauthorized disclosure.
             1.4.17.2.1.1. This includes, but is not limited to letters, resumes, articles,
             electronic mail (e-mail), web site postings, web log (blog) postings, internet
             message board discussions, or other forms of dissemination or documentation.
             1.4.17.2.1.2. Supervisors will provide guidance to personnel regarding critical
             and/or sensitive information to ensure it is not disclosed in public forums. Each
             organization‘s OPSEC PM/SM/coordinator will advise supervisors on means to
             prevent the public disclosure of critical and/or sensitive information.
             1.4.17.2.1.3. Encryption serves as one measure to protect critical or sensitive
             information transmitted over unclassified networks. Encrypt all e-mail messages
             containing critical information, OPSEC indicators, and other sensitive
             information. (AFI 33-119, Air Force Messaging Paragraph 6.1.2)
         1.4.17.2.2. Do not publicly disseminate, or publish photographs displaying critical
         and/or sensitive information. Examples include but are not limited to: Improvised

         personnel killed in action (both friendly and adversary), and the protective measures
         of military facilities.
         1.4.17.2.3. Do not publicly reference, disseminate, or publish critical and/or sensitive
         information already compromised. This provides further unnecessary exposure of the
         compromised information and may serve as validation.
         1.4.17.2.4. Actively encourage others (including family members and family
         readiness groups) to protect critical and/or sensitive information.
         1.4.17.2.5. Destroy (burn, shred, etc.) critical and/or sensitive unclassified
         information no longer needed to prevent the inadvertent disclosure and/or
         reconstruction of this material.
         1.4.17.2.5. (ACC) Recommend a 100% shred and recycle policy for documents
         containing critical information. Examples include, but are not limited to: local/HHQ
         exercises, test schedules, training and equipment vulnerabilities and limitations,
         personnel availability and recall procedures, ACC funding, capabilities and long-term
         planning, and individual/unit travel itineraries and flight plans.
     1.4.17.3. Implement protection measures as ordered by the commander, director, or an
     individual in an equivalent position.
     1.4.17.4. Know who their organization‘s OPSEC PM and Coordinator is and contact
     them for questions, concerns, or recommendations for OPSEC or signature management
     related topics.
     1.4.17.5. Consider attempts by unauthorized personnel to solicit critical and/or sensitive
     information as human intelligence (HUMINT) gathering and consider it a HUMINT
     incident.
         1.4.17.5.1. AF personnel who have been involved in or have knowledge of a possible
         incident will report all facts immediately to the nearest supporting AFOSI office as
         required by AFI 71-101, Vol 4, Counterintelligence.
         1.4.17.5.2. If these offices are not readily available, HUMINT incidents will be
         reported to the organization‘s security manager or commander who will ensure that,
         without exception, reports are relayed as securely and expeditiously within 24 hours
         to the nearest AFOSI organization.
  1.4.18. (Added-ACC) Reports of lost/stolen unit critical information will be sent over
  SIPRNET or higher secure systems in standard memorandum format. OPSEC PMs/SMOs
  will up channel OPSEC related incident reports to the ACC/A3I. All OPSEC related incident
  reports will be sanitized to safeguard personnel involved. If the commander, PM, or SMO
  deems an OPSEC related incident report(s) requires HHQ notification or resolution, SMOs
  will forward OPSEC related incident report(s) to the next HHQ OPSEC PM NLT 15 days
  after the report is signed. OPSEC related incident report(s) will be received by ACC/A3I
  NLT 30 days after report is signed. Example of OPSEC related incident reports can range
  from lost/stolen laptop(s) containing critical information to lost/stolen report(s) that contain
  critical information.
  1.4.19. (Added-ACC) Local AFOSI will provide local threat information needed for the
  requesting unit's OPSEC process.

                                            Chapter 2

                                SIGNATURE MANAGEMENT

2.1. Signature Management. Signature management (SM) utilizes a process of profiling day-
to-day observable activities and operational trends at installations and each of its resident units.
SM incorporates preparatory methodologies of OPSEC and MILDEC creating synergies and
resource efficiencies for both the OPSEC and MILDEC wing/installation programs. These
methodologies result in identified processes and details that can be used in efforts to defend or
exploit operational profiles resident at a given military installation. Defense of operational
profiles is accomplished by implementing protective measures to deny or mitigate adversary
collection of critical information. Development of protective measures is often accomplished
using MILDEC tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). The TTPs used for protection of
operational profiles are collectively referred to as Deception in Support of OPSEC (DISO).
NOTE: The guidance in this chapter is intended for Signature Management personnel at the
wing/installation level. The Signature Management Officer (SMO) and Signature Management
NCO (SMNCO) take on the responsibilities of the OPSEC and Military Deception (MILDEC)
PM.
   2.1.1. Signature Management is administered through a wing or installation SMO/SMNCO.
   An SMO/SMNCO can be appointed the primary or alternate wing or installation OPSEC PM.
   When an air component commander‘s MILDEC plan requires Air Force wings and
   installations to present specified observable activities, the air component commander‘s
   MILDEC planner will determine the actions required by the supporting unit(s) and will
   communicate those requirements to the SMO/SMNCO.
   2.1.1. (ACC) ACC GSU groups are designated as wing equivalents and will maintain their
   own OPSEC and MILDEC programs under a Signature Management Office unless waivered
   by HQ ACC/A3I. The waiver request should come from the Group commander through his
   administrative Wing commander, to ACC/A3I stating rationale for not having the programs.
   ACC GSUs will do SM for their own unit and integrate with host unit by participating in the
   host‘s SMWG.
   2.1.2. Signature management, OPSEC, and MILDEC are a commander's responsibility. The
   SMO/SMNCO will define the local operating environment and capture process points that
   present key signatures and profiles with critical information value. This process, known as
   the Base Profiling Process (BPP), is the deliberate effort to identify functional areas and the
   observables they produce to contribute to the overall signature of day-to-day activities and
   operational trends. Once the BPP is complete, the results can be used to develop a wing level
   CIL and identify key process points for potential protection or exploitation. This ultimately
   provides commanders several options to exploit or deny operational signatures to ensure
   mission effectiveness.
   2.1.2. (ACC) The SMO will have direct unrestricted access to the wing/installation
   commander to ensure immediate relay of any actual real-world taskings, potential/actual
   OPSEC compromise, or critical issues. This arrangement will be communicated to the
   SMOs chain of command and Commander‘s staff to streamline the execution of
AFI10-701_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                           25


   MAJCOM/Combatant Commander exercise and operational tasking. The commander will
   consider this requirement when appointing the SMO.
   2.1.3. (Added-ACC) The installation SMO will provide all new unit commanders a SM
   orientation briefing within 30 days of assuming commander duties. This orientation briefing
   will outline the installation SM program, to include SMWG membership, training and
   exercise requirements, base profiling process (BPP) requirements and status, and commander
   support responsibilities to ensure sustained SM program continuity and effectiveness. The
   SMO will document completion of unit commander SM orientation training in the SM
   Continuity Book and retain documentation until the commander relinquishes command (see
   continuity book I 3 a.)
2.2. Wing or installation commanders will:
2.2. (ACC)Wing or installation commanders will: ACC wing commanders will implement
SM operations within 60 days of this supplement effective date. ACC GSUs will implement and
conduct SM operations tailored to their unit size, mission and responsibilities and participate in
the host installation SMWG. The SMO/SMNCO will assume duties historically assigned to the
wing OPSEC PM and Military Deception Officer, as defined in AFI 10-704, Military Deception
Program, and ACC supplement guidance. Wing Commanders will follow the guidance in this
section in addition to the requirements in Chapter 1.4.15. of the AFI and this Supplement.
   2.2.1. Appoint in writing a primary and alternate SMO/SMNCO who will function as the
   OPR for all SM activities. The primary SMO will be an O-3 or above, or civilian equivalent.
   The alternate SMO will be an E-6 or above, or civilian equivalent. Under no circumstances
   will contract personnel be appointed as a primary or alternate SMO/SMNCO. At a
   minimum, SMO/SMNCOs will have a secret clearance (recommend Top Secret) and have
   two years retainability in the position or as area tour length dictates (remote tours only).
   Organizations requiring appointment of an SMO/SMNCO for less than two years will
   request, in writing, a waiver through their MAJCOM OPSEC PM from AF/A3Z-CI.
   2.2.1. (ACC) Wing and installation commanders will: Wing commanders will appoint a
   SMO/SMNCO to serve a minimum of two years to ensure OPSEC program continuity, long-
   term stability, and maximize training investment. Wing commander‘s will not permit the
   SMO or SMNCO position to go vacant for more than one month and will identify/appoint a
   replacement NLT one month prior to the incumbent‘s departure/relinquishing of duties.
   Wing commanders will notify HQ ACC/A3I when the SMO/SMNCO billet remains vacant
   for more than one month and provide a get well date. Wing commander requests for waivers
   (See Attachment 6 Sample Waiver Memo) to the two year requirement will receive serious
   HQ ACC/A3I. Deviation from meeting minimum rank criteria requires HQ ACC/A3I
   waiver. All approved waivers will be retained at HQ ACC/A3I and a copy filed in the SMO
   Continuity Book Note: For the purpose of this Supplement an installation is an AF base that
   is geographical entity. For bases that have been grouped together such as in Joint Base
   Langley-Eustis, there will be an installation SMO for each base-one at Langley and one for
   Eustis. Another example is Nellis-Creech where there should be an installation SMO for
   each base.
       2.2.1.1. In the event that host and tenant organizations on a given installation are
       subordinate to different MAJCOMs, the host MAJCOM OPSEC PM will coordinate and
26                                          AFI10-701_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2012


     document how SM using protective and exploitation countermeasures will be conducted
     on that installation.
     2.2.1.1. (ACC) At installations with multiple wings/wing-equivalent organizations
     assigned, all ACC wings/wing-equivalent organizations (whether host or tenant status)
     will appoint a primary SMO. This individual will be in the grade of O-3 or above, civilian
     equivalent, or E-7. Deviation from these requirements must be approved by HQ
     ACC/A3I.
        2.2.1.1.1. All wings based on the installation, regardless of their MAJCOM
        affiliation, will have a SMO/SMNCO assigned. However, the host wing/installation
        SMO/SMNCO will act as the lead for all SM activities. This agreement will be
        stipulated on a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and should carry the weight of
        each signatory Wing Commander on the MOA as the designated SMO/SMNCO
        executes their duties for the installation.
        2.2.1.1.1. (ACC) Although there are some installations with only one wing the
        majority of installations now have more than one unit. Therefore installation does not
        mean wing. Installations that have multiple organizations shall have a MOA, signed
        by the host and all tenant commanders, that specifies host/tenant roles and
        responsibilities. Each wing is responsible for establishing and maintaining its own
        OPSEC and MILDEC programs under the SM office tailored to its missions,
        activities, threats, and vulnerabilities. Each wing commander/GSU group commander
        is responsible for using the base profiling process to assist in risk analysis based on
        that unit‘s mission. These may be different if one unit deploys while others remain in
        garrison.      All hosts and tenants need to work together to share CILs,
        Countermeasures, Threat Analysis to help protect all the critical information on the
        base regardless of ownership.            ACC host wings will lead an installation
        SM/OPSEC/MILDEC program and each organization will have their own tailored
        program see Attachment 8 Host Tenant Relationships for ACC Units. If the ACC
        wing is a tenant to a non-ACC host, the ACC SMO will seek out the host OPSEC
        SMO and provide to the host the unit‘s appointment letter, CIL, and countermeasures.
        ACC wing SMOs will report to ACC OPSEC and MILDEC PMs. Installation
        SM/OPSEC MOAs will be reviewed biannually or within 30 days of a change of any
        one of the signatories. All wing SMOs, whether installation host or tenant will
        identify the processes that their wing uses per section 2.3. The differences between
        an installation SMO and a tenant wing SMO will be delineated with these processes
        that will be approved by ACC/A3I and then codified in the installation MOA.
        2.2.1.1.2. The substance of this arrangement will be documented and kept on file for
        every installation for which this condition applies and incorporated into MAJCOM
        supplements to this instruction. A copy of the MOA will be forwarded to the
        MAJCOM OPSEC PM and AF/A3Z-CI.
        2.2.1.1.3. (Added-ACC) Wing commanders will appoint an additional alternate
        SMO to ensure effective OPSEC program oversight and continuity when the
        appointed primary or alternate is deployed/TDY for more than sixty continuous days.
        Unit commanders may appoint more than one alternate SMO when unit size and/or
        mission dictate; however these additional individuals must materially contribute to
AFI10-701_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                             27


          the program‘s administration. Appointment letters will document additional SMO
          alternates. Note: HAF funds may not be available for training more than two SMOs
          per unit and would require unit funding any additional personnel to attend required
          SM training course.
          2.2.1.1.4. (Added-ACC) Ensure continuity of operations by identifying, in writing,
          the replacement SMO NLT one month prior to the incumbent‘s departure from the
          position. Forward new appointment letter(s) to HQ ACC/A3I NLT ten days of the
          commander signing the appointment letter and before incumbent‘s departure (See
          Attachment 4: SIGNATURE MANAGEMENT APPOINTMENT LETTER
          TEMPLATE. SMO appointment letter(s), and two-year waiver request, if required,
          may be submitted electronically via e-mail.
   2.2.2. Submit request through servicing MPF for award of special experience (SEI) 9O or
   234 as appropriate for individuals appointed as SMO/SMNCOs who meet all qualifications
   as identified in the Air Force Officer and Enlisted Classification Directories.
   2.2.2. (ACC) Commander‘s will comply with AFI 10-701 requirement to request Special
   Experience Identifiers (SEIs) be awarded to qualified individuals by contacting the servicing
   personnel office. SEI award criteria can be found in the AF Officer Classification Directory
   (AFOCD) and the AF Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD) Part I and Part II located at
   https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/answers/detail/a_id/7504/p/8%2C10/c/549.
   2.2.3. (Added-ACC) Wing Commander‘s will issue and enforce organization OPSEC
   policy, guidance and instructions.
   2.2.4. (Added-ACC) The SMWG is a vital element in the OPSEC process. Wing and
   group-level GSU commanders will ensure the SMO formally establishes and maintains a
   SMWG and that SMWG members are identified, trained, periodically exercised and prepared
   to respond to short-notice SM planning requirements and taskings. SMWGs will be
   established at the wing and installation level and chaired by the appointed SMO/SMNCO.
2.3. Signature Management Officer/Signature Management Non-Commissioned Officer
will:
2.3. (ACC)Signature Management Officer/Signature Management Non-Commissioned
Officer will: Wing level SMOs will accomplish all items in this section in addition to
paragraph 1.4.16 of the AFI and this supplement.
   2.3.1. Follow guidance in this instruction and when appointed/assigned for MILDEC, follow
   AFI 10-704, Military Deception Program.
   2.3.2. Advise the commander on all SM related matters, to include developing and
   recommending policy, guidance, and instructions. Review periodically for currency and
   update as necessary.
   2.3.2. (ACC) SMOs will ensure wing policy and guidance is reviewed biannually or more
   often as required by changing threats, missions, and/or vulnerabilities.
   2.3.3. Use the base profiling process to develop and maintain a master checklist of all
   activities associated with the mission areas for the wing or installation (i.e., recall, mobility
   processing, aircraft generation, airlift load generation and marshaling, munitions, personnel
   and equipment deployment, etc.). The checklist will be modified, as required, to support
 28                                           AFI10-701_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2012


   tasks associated with supported commander‘s requirements.         Therefore, well-developed
   master checklists are mandatory.
NOTE: MAJCOM subordinate organizations below the air component level are NOT required to
develop supporting MILDEC tabs (C-3A) to combatant command plans or supporting air
component plans.
      2.3.3.1. (Added-ACC) ACC units will develop a signature management master
      checklists that includes all activities/processes conducted by the installation/wing. Table
      2.1 Standard Wing Activities for Base Profiling lists the minimum activities/processes
      that most installations/wings engage in and will be used by the SMO. If a particular
      installation/wing does not conduct one of the ―standard‖ activities/processes the SMO
      will request a waiver from the MAJCOM PM stating the reason the unit does not do that
      activity. The wing and installation SMO will conduct the BPP on all wing activities over
      and above the minimum stated in this list. If a SMO determines his wing does an
      activity(ies) not on this list the SMO will identify the activity(ies) to the MAJCOM PM .
      2.3.3.2. (Added-ACC) SMOs will use the BPP developed checklists to improve
      OPSEC plans, execution, and assessment. The detailed study of the activities/processes
      is useful to help identify critical information, vulnerabilities, countermeasures and the
      MOEs/MOPs needed in the OPSEC process.

     2.3.4. Develop and maintain a current commander approved CIL.
     2.3.4. (ACC) Strive to keep unit CIL(s) ―UNCLASSIFIED‖ and not ―FOR OFFICIAL USE
     ONLY.‖ CIL(s) are to assist with reminding personnel to protect related critical information.
     If some critical information is considered FOUO include that information in an FOUO
     OPSEC plan with associated countermeasures but do not include on the publically distributed
     list.
     2.3.5. Implement SM execution checklists as directed or authorized by their wing or
     installation commander, MAJCOM OPSEC PM, or the supported air component commander,
     as appropriate.
     2.3.5. (ACC) Use the format found in Attachment 11 for the signature management
     execution checklist.

  2.3.6. Identify key personnel involved in the planning and execution of each of the major
  functional mission areas, and select subject matter experts (SMEs) who can assist in the
  development, exercising, and execution of the protective or exploitation countermeasures and
  activities. Grant access to SM material and plans on the commander's authority alone (this
  may be delegated to the SMO/SMNCO for expediency as determined by the commander).
  2.3.7. Work closely with antiterrorism, force protection, information protection, PA, web
  administrators, and other officials designated by the commander who share responsibility for
  the protection and release of information to ensure critical information is protected.
  2.3.8. Answer questions, develop guidance and provide advice to PA and other information
  releasing officials concerning protecting critical information during reviews of public and/or
  private web pages.
  2.3.9. Attend the Air Force Signature Management Course within 90 days of appointment or
  by the next available class. If scheduling conflicts exist, MAJCOM OPSEC PMs must
  document and ensure SMO/SMNCOs are scheduled for the next available course not to
  exceed 180 days. If training is not completed within 180 days, MAJCOM OPSEC PMs must
  request a waiver from AF/A3Z-CI.
  2.3.9. (ACC) Approved waivers (see Attachment 6 Sample Waiver Letter) will be
  retained in the continuity book (see Attachment 7 STANDARDIZED ACC UNIT
  SM/OPSEC CONTINUITY BOOK) by the SMO.
  2.3.10. Conduct SM exercises at the wing or installation as directed by the parent
  MAJCOMs supplemental guidance.
     2.3.10.1. (Added-ACC) All ACC wings and installations, whether a host or tenant unit,
     will accomplish four quarterly SM exercises each FY. All SMO-tasked units, whether
     host or tenant, will perform quarterly SM exercises. Of the four exercises, two may be
     conducted as table-top events and the other two are fully exercised events. SM exercises
     may be integrated into a host or tenant unit exercise provided specific aspects of the
     unit‘s operational indicators are examined and their SMWG is exercised. For all
     exercises, ACC SMOs will forward their exercise CONOPS, execution checklist and
     after-action/lessons learned to HQ ACC/A3I IAW AFI 10-704_ACC SUP requirements.
     An operational log, capturing all exercise activities, will be accomplished for each
     exercise (See Attachment 13). This log will be used to assist in internal exercise ―hot
     wash‖ assessments and to improve overall SM process and products (i.e., checklists, BBP
     products) Retain the each exercise events log in the SM Continuity Book. (See
     Attachment 13 SIGNATURE MANAGEMENT EVENT LOG for example.)
  2.3.11. Work with exercise evaluation teams to observe and evaluate mission profiles and
  signatures, as well as measures of effectiveness (MOE) and measures of performance (MOP)
  that assess the organizations ability to mitigate loss of critical information. Evaluate how
  organization personnel execute protection or exploitation measures. Any deficiencies or best
  practices will be submitted in after action reports and to the AF lessons learned database
  (https://www.jllis.mil/usaf/) when applicable. Lessons learned will be used to develop
  tactics improvement proposals (TIPs) IAW AFI 10-204 and AFI 11-260.
  2.3.11. (ACC) The wing commander and SMO will determine Exercise Evaluation Team
  involvement considering the event, activities, and close hold methods to be used.

   2.3.12. Establish, train, and coordinate with the unit SM working group (SMWG) members
   to assist with planning and execution of SM activities.
   2.3.12. (ACC) The SMO is responsible for establishing the SMWG, training SMWG
   members and coordinating SMWG activities. The SMO will maintain a master SMWG
   roster, identifying all members. The master roster may also identify which members are
   assigned SME responsibilities for certain base processes, as OPSEC only duties, or if the
   member is responsible for SM planning and/or executing exploitative techniques (See
   Attachment 9).
   2.3.13. Coordinate, facilitate, and serve as the focal point for all assessments in support of
   SM activities such as surveys, annual program reviews, and vulnerability assessments as
   listed in Chapter 6.
   2.3.14. Develop and forward annual program reviews/reports for the period of 1 Oct through
   30 Sep each fiscal year to HHQ according to MAJCOM guidance.
   2.3.14. (ACC) Submit reports via OSCAR to the appropriate MAJCOM PM NLT 1 Oct
   annually. If OSCAR is not available then submit via email. To facilitate HHQ reporting
   requirements, do not send reports as an imaged PDF file instead use Word‘s ―Save as a PDF
   file‖ option as this will permit text extraction/consolidation and HHQ reporting. Wing
   commander signatures may be imaged or e-signature.
   2.3.15. (Added-ACC) Upon appointment of a new SMO, the out-going SMO will
   accomplish an OPSEC and MILDEC program management handoff to their replacement.
   The handoff will include at a minimum a program status briefing and continuity book review.
   2.3.16. (Added-ACC) As soon as the unit is notified of an operational deployment or
   overseas exercise, ensure the gaining command‘s OPSEC PM is contacted for its OPSEC
   requirements and the deploying unit can also pass their critical information list (CIL) to the
   gaining OPSEC PM. Additionally, the SMO at the deploying unit will:
      2.3.16.1. (Added-ACC) Ensure their unit(s)             obtain   and    disseminates    the
      operation/exercise CIL and countermeasures.
      2.3.16.2. (Added-ACC) Ensure unit deploying personnel are briefed on OPSEC
      considerations and implement any necessary countermeasures to protect and preclude
      compromise of critical information.
      2.3.16.3. (Added-ACC) When units deploy, a SMO or trained OPSEC Coordinator
      should deploy with the unit to work with the receiving installation SMO and AF
      Component OPSEC and MILDEC PMs/planners. This collaboration should begin once
      the deploying unit is notified until it returns to home station to ensure OPSEC and
      MILDEC protective countermeasures are implemented pre-, during, and post
      deployment.
2.4. Signature Management Planning and Coordination. NOTE: Ensure proper security
guidelines are followed when planning and coordinating SM activities.
   2.4.1. Submit SM exercise concepts and execution checklists to their MAJCOM for
   coordination (refer AFI 10-704 and the MAJCOM Supplement for more details).

  2.4.1. (ACC) ACC units will forward the following documents to HQ ACC/A3IF for each
  SM exercise/operation:
     2.4.1.1. (Added-ACC) Before execution - Exercise Proposal Format. Submit no later
     than 60 days prior to proposed exercise/operation execution start date. (See Attachment
     10 for Exercise Proposal Format).
     2.4.1.2. (Added-ACC) Before execution – ACC SM execution checklist. Submit within
     30 days of exercise/operation execution. (See Attachment 10 Exercise Proposal
     Format and Attachment 11: Signature Management Execution Checklist.)
     2.4.1.3. (Added-ACC) After execution – Submit SM Lessons Learned (L2) worksheet
     within 45 days after exercise/operation termination. Use the AFI 90-1601, Special
     Management Air Force Lessons Learned Program, Attachment 3, Observation or Lesson
     Learned Template.) Note: The AF Lessons Learned Program (AFL2P) exists to enhance
     readiness and improve combat capability by capitalizing on the experiences of Airmen. A
     L2 is an Observation that, when validated and resolved, results in an improvement in
     military operations or activities at the strategic, operational, or tactical level and results in
     long-term, internalized change to an individual or an organization. Coupling L2 with past
     experiences should also assist senior leaders in programming, budgeting and allocating
     resources as well as making changes to doctrine, organization, training, materiel,
     leadership & education, personnel, facilities and policy (DOTMLPF&P). An L2 finding
     is not a compliance ―report card‖ nor is it automatically accepted and implemented
     without the scrutiny of functional experts. An L2 is also not ―owned‖ by any one
     organization. Rather, the mandate for all organizations participating in the AFL2P is to
     coordinate activities and collaboratively exchange observations and lessons identified for
     the benefit of the total AF mission.
         2.4.1.3.1. (Added-ACC) When accomplishing the L2 worksheet follow the four
         fundamental L2 components listed in AFI 90-1601, Figure 1.1: Collection,
         Validation, Dissemination and Resolution.
         2.4.1.3.2. (Added-ACC) As the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for SM
         issues the SMO/SMNCO will establish procedures for monitoring the status of
         Lessons identified and actions taken. The SM Office will ensure periodic updates are
         annotated in the SM Master Checklist and should observe corrective actions and be
         vigilant for similar repeat observations.
         2.4.1.3.3. (Added-ACC) L2 Validation and Resolution: The SMO will review L2
         observations for accuracy, applicability and completeness and that they are
         appropriately tracked to closure to ensure they become true L2 and not just forgotten
         or ignored.
         2.4.1.3.4. (Added-ACC) Classify L2 worksheet if required by AF or joint security
         classification guides.
     2.4.1.4. (Added-ACC) After execution – Submit SM After-Action Report (AAR)
     Worksheet within 45 days after exercise/operation termination. Use AFI 90-1601,
     Special Management Air Force Lessons Learned Program, Attachment 4, After Action
     Report Template. Submit a separate worksheet for each SM measure/event. Note:
     Whereas the SMO/SMNCO may have multiple L2 worksheets (one for each observation)
AFI10-701_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                        33


      associated with a single SM measure/event the SMO/SMNCO will only have one AAR
      worksheet for the entire measure/event. AARs are intended to help SMOs/SMNCOs
      fight a smarter, more capable fight and to be shared with other SMOs/SMNCOs for
      appropriate cross tell. Timely submissions of AARs (and the individual Observations
      which comprise them) are the SMOs/SMNCOs responsibility and they are expected to
      submit a unit-level AAR for the event (deployment, contingency, exercise, etc.) for which
      they are responsible. Observations to be documented are those which result in
      improvements in military operations at the strategic, operational, or tactical level. AAR
      Observations should describe how the mission could be/was improved, potential risks to
      mission degradation and how to mitigate those risks. AARs are intended to be more than
      a summary or rollup of unit/tactical actions. Whenever possible, AARs should be
      submitted as soon as practical to permit timely action but NLT then 45 days after
      measure/event termination.
      2.4.1.5. (Added-ACC) Classify AAR worksheet if required by AF or joint security
      classification guides.
   2.4.2. Submit SM execution checklists supporting real-world operations to the appropriate
   tasking authority (e.g., supported air component commands or MAJCOM OPSEC PM).
   2.4.3. For SM activities utilizing exploitation countermeasures that require implementation
   outside of the installation, coordinate with the host wing/installation MILDEC POC (refer to
   AFI 10-704, Paragraph 2.4.3).
   2.4.4. Request assistance from the intelligence organization at the next level of their
   administrative and/or operational chain of command when requiring intelligence that exceeds
   organic capability. Counterintelligence support will be requested from the unit's local
   AFOSI detachment.
   2.4.5. Organizations needing assistance from Air Staff will make their request through their
   MAJCOM OPSEC PM.
2.5. Exploitation Countermeasures (Refer to AFI 10-704, Paragraph 2 4.3 for additional
guidance).

                                           Chapter 3

                                     OPSEC PLANNING

3.1. General. This chapter provides direction for planners at wings, Air Force Component
Headquarters (AFFOR and AOC) to integrate OPSEC into plans. Air Force forces can be under
observation at their peacetime bases and locations, in training or exercises, while moving, or
when deployed to the field conducting actual operations. OPSEC methodology provides
systematic and comprehensive analysis designed to identify observable friendly actions that
could betray intentions or capabilities. Therefore, OPSEC principles must be integrated into
operational, support, exercise, and acquisition planning. All plans will be reviewed periodically
to ensure currency and updated when required.
   3.1.1. OPSEC PMs, SMO/SMNCOs, or Coordinators will assist organization planners to
   incorporate protection of critical information and indicators into supported operational plans
   (OPLANS) and supporting plans. They will also assist exercise planners in developing
   master scenario events listings (MSEL) and MOP to train organization personnel in the
   application or execution of countermeasures (See AFDD 2, Operations and Organizations,
   for more information concerning MOE and MOP.
   3.1.2. OPSEC Planners will follow guidance as outlined in AFI 13-1AOC, Volume 3,
   Operational Procedures-Air and Space Operations Center, and Chapter 3 of this document.
3.2. Operational Planning. OPSEC will be included in all OPLANs, concept plans
(CONPLANs), functional plans (FUNCPLANs), and operation orders (OPORDS), etc.. Planners
will use existing TTPs to develop Tab C to Appendix 3 to Annex C to the OPORD or OPLAN.
The planning staff will identify critical information and OPSEC indicators from all functional
areas requiring protection throughout each phase of the operation. Risk assessments will be used
to identify applicable countermeasures to mitigate any unacceptable operational risks. MOP and
MOE will be developed for each OPSEC measure.
   3.2.1. Operational planning is typically focused at the Air Force Component Headquarters
   (AFFOR and AOC), with reach-back support outside the theater when appropriate. When
   planning duties are split, all responsible entities will integrate OPSEC into their planning
   efforts (see also JP 3-13.3, Operations Security, Chapter 3). As the supported organization,
   the theater AOC will resolve debates and provide general guidance.
   3.2.1. (ACC) OPSEC PMs at the component Headquarters will provide their OPSEC plan
   with CIL, threats, vulnerabilities, countermeasures, and points of contact to supporting
   organizations (e.g. wings that will deploy for overseas exercises and/or operational
   deployments). This action will occur as soon as the unit(s) is identified so that critical
   information can be protected before there are compromises. Component OPSEC planners
   are responsible for creating/updating the OPSEC Annex C, Appendix 3, Tab C (C-3-C) for
   each OPLAN or CONPLAN as prescribed in CJCSM 3122.03C, Joint Operation Planning
   and Execution System Volume II Planning Formats and Guidance.
3.3. Support Planning. Integrate OPSEC into all wartime and contingency plans as well as
support plans, i.e., programming plans and in-garrison expeditionary site plans.
AFI10-701_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                         35


3.3. (ACC) Support Planning. Note: See AFI 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary Site
Planning, for In-garrison Expeditionary Support Plan requirements and format.
3.4. Exercise Planning. In order to enhance combat readiness and improve crisis response,
OPSEC will be included in all exercise plans (EXPLANs). Specific OPSEC and/or signature
management scenarios will be included in the exercise MSELs with MOE and MOP to assess the
proficiency of functional planners to mitigate loss of critical information and organization
personnel to execute countermeasures. Deficiencies or best practices will be submitted to the AF
lessons learned database (https://www.jllis.mil/usaf/) when applicable to assist in the
assessment of critical information being posting in public forums. Lessons learned will be used
to develop tactics improvement proposals (TIPs) IAW AFI 10-204, Readiness Exercises and
After-Action Reporting Program, and AFI 11-260, Tactics Development Program.
   3.4.1. OPSEC measures will also be employed during exercises to minimize observations of
   sensitive training activities by adversary surveillance and treaty verification activities.
3.5. Acquisition Planning. OPSEC requirements will be determined for all acquisitions and
contractor-supported efforts beginning with operational capabilities requirements generation and
continues through design, development, test and evaluation, fielding, sustainment and system
disposal. When required to protect sensitive military operations, commanders will ensure
OPSEC requirements are added to contracts. Commanders will evaluate contractor-developed
and proposed OPSEC programs for compliance with required standards.
NOTE: For more detailed planning instructions, refer to AFI 10-400 series publications.

                                            Chapter 4

                                      OPSEC PROCESS

4.1. General: OPSEC is an iterative five-step process: 1) Identify critical information; 2)
Analyze threats; 3) Analyze vulnerabilities; 4) Assess risk; and 5) Apply countermeasures.
Although normally applied in a sequential manner the process during deliberate or crisis action
planning, dynamic situations may require any step to be revisited at any time.
4.2. Identify Critical Information:
   4.2.1. Critical information is a specific fact about friendly intentions, capabilities, and
   activities vitally needed by adversaries for them to plan and act effectively, so as to guarantee
   failure or unacceptable consequences for friendly mission accomplishment. The product of
   the first step in the OPSEC process is to record your critical information in a critical
   information list (CIL).
   4.2.2. Critical information is best identified by the individuals responsible for the planning
   and execution of the organization‘s mission. A working group or staff planning team can
   most effectively accomplish this task. Once a CIL is developed, commanders must approve
   the list and then ensure their critical information is protected and/or controlled.
   4.2.3. Critical information will be identified at the earliest stages of planning an operation or
   activity and continuously updated as necessary to support mission effectiveness.
4.3. Analyze Threats:
   4.3.1. A threat is an adversary with the capability and intent to undertake action detrimental
   to the success of program activities or operations.
   4.3.2. The primary source of local threat information is your local AFOSI detachment. For
   mission related intelligence support, contact your local intelligence unit. Generic validated
   threat data is provided by the Defense Intelligence Agency via the OPSEC assessment tool,
   OSCAR.
   4.3.2. (ACC) Local AFOSI will provide local threat information. Local intelligence unit
   will provide mission related intelligence support. Threats can include foreign intelligence
   services, terrorist organizations (foreign and domestic), criminals, cyber, lone extremists (not
   all inclusive). Reports from cyber/communications, organizations will be used to assess the
   cyber threat and vulnerabilities.
   4.3.3. Intelligence organizations analyze the threat through research of intelligence,
   counterintelligence, and open source information to identify who is likely to disrupt, deny,
   degrade, or destroy planned operations.
   4.3.4. A threat assessment should identify adversaries, their goals, what they already know,
   their capability and intent to collect critical information, and potential courses of action.
4.4. Analyze Vulnerabilities:
   4.4.1. A vulnerability exists when the adversary is capable of collecting critical information
   or indicators, analyzing them and then acting quickly enough to impact friendly objectives.
   The vulnerability can be your procedures, a failure of traditional security, poor judgment on
AFI10-701_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                           37


   the part of leadership, the fact that we process critical information on data based systems, or
   the system‘s design itself.
       4.4.1.1. An indicator is a friendly detectable action and open-source information that can
       be interpreted or pieced together by an adversary to derive critical information.
   4.4.2. A vulnerability exists when the adversary is capable of collecting critical information
   and/or indicators, correctly analyzing them, and then takes timely action. The adversary
   essentially uses your critical information to support their decision-making process. The
   adversary has then exploited your vulnerability to obtain an advantage over you.
   4.4.3. A vulnerability analysis is the examination of your processes, projects or missions to
   determine if you have inherent, naturally occurring or self-induced vulnerabilities or
   indicators that put your critical information and thus your mission at risk.
4.5. Assess Risk:
   4.5.1. A risk is a measure of the potential degree to which protected information is subject to
   loss through adversary exploitation. Risk is assessed as the probability an adversary will
   gain knowledge of your critical information and the impact (on your mission) if the adversary
   is successful. A working group or staff planning team must conduct a risk assessment and
   develop recommended countermeasures based on operational planning and current operating
   environment. A typical risk assessment will:
       4.5.1.1. Compare vulnerabilities identified with the probability of an adversary being
       able to exploit it in time to be useful to determine a risk level.
       4.5.1.2. Determine potential countermeasures to reduce vulnerabilities with the highest
       risk. The most desirable countermeasures are those that combine the highest possible
       protection with the least resource requirements and/or adverse effect on operational
       effectiveness.
4.6. Apply Countermeasures:
   4.6.1. Countermeasures are anything that effectively negates or mitigates an adversary‘s
   ability to exploit vulnerabilities. Countermeasures may be both offensive and defensive in
   nature.
   4.6.2. Potential countermeasures, among other actions are, camouflage, concealment,
   deception (CCD), intentional deviations from normal patterns, and direct strikes against
   adversary collection.
   4.6.3. The working group or staff planning team through the OPSEC PM, SMO or
   Coordinator will submit recommended countermeasures for commander approval through the
   operational planning process for employment or through appropriate staffing process.
   Organizations that do not have or require a planning cell will submit recommended
   countermeasures to the commander through appropriate staffing process.
   4.6.4. Countermeasures must be synchronized with other components of IO to achieve
   synergies in efforts to influence the adversary‘s perceptions and situational awareness. Care
   must be taken so that countermeasures do not become vulnerabilities or unacceptable
   indicators themselves.
 38                                           AFI10-701_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2012


   4.6.5. During the execution of countermeasures, the adversary‘s reaction to the measures is
   monitored, if possible, to provide feedback that can be used to assess effectiveness or
   determine potential unintended consequences.
4.7. (Added-ACC) Required OPSEC products. ACC OPSEC PM/SMO/planners will use the
OPSEC process as described in AFI 10-701 paragraphs 4.1-4.6 and will produce the following
products:
   4.7.1. (Added-ACC) The unit‘s operational CIL (proposed and final).
   4.7.2. (Added-ACC) A Threat Analysis of your unit.
   4.7.3. (Added-ACC) A list of your unit/installation‘s Vulnerabilities and Indicators.
   4.7.4. (Added-ACC) A Risk Analysis of your unit‘s vulnerabilities (before and after
   proposed countermeasures are implemented)
   4.7.5. (Added-ACC) A list of proposed Countermeasures, the costs of implementing those
   CMs, and those CMs that are chosen to implement.
   4.7.6. (Added-ACC) MOE(s)and MOP(s) for each countermeasure
   4.7.7. (Added-ACC) RFIs and other reports needed to assess the MOPs/MOEs.
   4.7.8. (Added-ACC) Assessments of the countermeasures as determined from Intelligence
   and OSI reports, and periodic wing exercises.
4.8. (Added-ACC) In addition to the PM products listed in 4.7. the wing SMO will use the
base profiling process to produce the following products:
   4.8.1. (Added-ACC) A wing/installation SMWG/POC list
   4.8.2. (Added-ACC) A list of major wing/installation activities/missions (see paragraph
   2.3.3.1. and Table 2.1 Standard ACC Wing Activities for Base Profiling

                                            Chapter 5

                           OPSEC EDUCATION AND TRAINING

5.1. General. All Air Force personnel (military and civilian) and contractors who have access
to mission critical information require a general knowledge of threats, vulnerabilities and their
responsibilities associated with protecting critical information. This is accomplished through
initial and annual OPSEC training. Standardized AF OPSEC awareness training located on the
AF Advanced Distributed Learning Service is the baseline training required for all personnel.
Organization specific training will be provided in addition to this training to ensure all personnel
in the Air Force are aware of local threats, vulnerabilities and critical information unique to their
duty assignment. OPSEC PMs/SMO/SMNCOs/Coordinators, and planners assigned to OPSEC
positions require more in-depth training designed to ensure proper management, planning, and
execution of organizational OPSEC programs.
5.1. (ACC) General. HQAF has clarified the requirement of 5.1. and 5.2.3. since publishing AFI
10-701. The OPSEC annual refresher awareness education requirement is satisfied by completing the
Information Protection block of training within The Advanced Distributed Learning Service (ADLS)
site https://golearn2.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp?kc_ident=kc0001#. Refresher education is
basic information to reinforce the understanding of OPSEC policy and procedures, critical
information, and procedures covered in initial/localized OPSEC training.
5.2. All Personnel:
   5.2.1. Awareness education will be provided to all personnel (military, civilian and
   contractors) upon initial entrance/accession into military service.
   5.2.2. Awareness education provided in accession programs will encompass what OPSEC is,
   its purpose, threat awareness and the individual's role in protecting critical information.
   5.2.3. Organization-specific initial OPSEC awareness training will be provided at each new
   duty location as part of in-processing and annually thereafter, at a minimum. Personnel must
   understand the scope of the threats, the nature of the vulnerabilities and their responsibility to
   execute countermeasures to protect critical information and organization specific OPSEC
   indicators. Annual training must include, at a minimum, updated threat and vulnerability
   information, changes to critical information and new procedures and/or countermeasures
   implemented by the organization.
   5.2.3. (ACC) Local organization-specific OPSEC awareness education is required when an
   individual processes into a new organization and/or when a commander determines the need
   for awareness education. This is considered event driven and not AF directed annual
   refresher training. Recommend including the OPSEC awareness education in the unit‘s in-
   processing briefings (i.e., Right Start, etc.) to fulfill initial in-processing requirement. Ensure
   the OPSEC awareness training is appropriately tracked and the individual is given credit for
   the initial unit training.
       5.2.3.1. In addition, commanders/directors shall encourage assigned personnel to share
       OPSEC awareness information with family members (both immediate and extended) and
       social network "friends". This will ensure family members and friends understand how
       adversaries can use public media sources such as but not limited to web sites, blogs,
 40                                           AFI10-701_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2012


      social networking sites, newspapers, and television to obtain critical information that can
      be used to target AF members and their families.
      5.2.3.2. Procurement of low value promotional and awareness aids such as pens, pencils,
      magnets, key chains, lanyards, etc., is authorized for the exclusive intent to promote
      OPSEC awareness and education in accordance with organizational missions. For
      Guidance, refer to AFI 65-601, Vol 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures.
   5.2.4. OPSEC PMs/SMO/SMNCOs/Coordinators will provide OPSEC training or training
   materials to contract employees within 90 days of employees‘ initial assignment to the
   contract.
5.3. OPSEC PMs/SMO/SMNCOs/Coordinators, Planners, Inspection Teams:
   5.3.1. Formal OPSEC training. Formal OPSEC training is required for all OPSEC
   PMs/SMO/SMNCOs, and planners assigned to OPSEC positions. Formal OPSEC training is
   any in-residence course intended to support the AF OPSEC Program.
      5.3.1.1. Completion of the Air Force Signature Management Course is mandatory for
      OPSEC PMs (below MAJCOM level), SMO/SMNCOs and planners within 90 days of
      appointment and within 180 days of appointment for MAJCOM OPSEC PMs. If
      scheduling conflicts exist, MAJCOM OPSEC PMs must document and ensure
      SMO/SMNCOs are scheduled for the next available course not to exceed 180 days. If
      training is not completed within 180 days, MAJCOM OPSEC PMs must request a waiver
      from the AF OPSEC PM.
         5.3.1.1.1. (Added-ACC) For ACC units, if scheduling conflicts exist, a waiver will
         be sent to ACC/A3I signed by the wing (for SMO/SMNCO) or HQ (for PMs)
         commander. ACC OPSEC PM will then request a waiver from AF OPSEC PM. The
         approved waiver will be kept on file by the requesting and approving OPSEC PMs in
         their continuity books and maintained for three years.
         5.3.1.1.2. (Added-ACC) Note that the AFI requires OPSEC PMs below MAJCOM
         level and SMO/SMNCOs to attend both the Signature Management Course (SMC)
         and the Interagency OPSEC Support Staff ‗s (IOSS) OPSEC Analysis and Program
         Management Course, OPSE 2500. HQ ACC cannot ―grandfather‖ PMs. Current
         OPSEC PMs who have attended only one of the two courses need to attend the other
         course within 90 days.
         5.3.1.1.3. (Added-ACC) To schedule SMC attendance, individuals must complete
         and return a nomination form provided by HQ ACC/A3I. ACC receives an allotment
         of class seats that will be prioritized across the command.
      5.3.1.2. Completion of OPSE-2500, OPSEC Analysis and Program Management
      Course is required for all OPSEC PMs within 90 days of appointment. If scheduling
      conflicts exist, OPSEC PMs must document and ensure they are scheduled for the next
      available course not to exceed 180 days. If training is not completed within 180 days,
      individuals must notify their HHQ OPSEC PM.
      5.3.1.2. (ACC) ACC OPSEC PMs will attend OPSE 2500 within 90 days of
      appointment. If scheduling conflicts exist, a waiver will be sent to ACC/A3I signed by
      the wing commander. HQ ACC/A3I will then request a waiver from the AF OPSEC PM.

      OPSEC PMs can schedule OPSE 2500 directly with the IOSS. Upon graduation send a
      copy of the course certificate to the HQ ACC OPSEC PM.
   5.3.2. OPSEC Orientation Training.          OPSEC Coordinators, planners, vulnerability
   assessment team, inspection team, and Operations Security Working Group (OWG) members
   are required to complete OPSEC orientation training within 30 days of assignment to OPSEC
   duties. The Interagency OPSEC Support Staff‘s (IOSS) multimedia product ―An
   Introduction to OPSEC (An Interactive Primer by the Department of Defense)‖ is the
   accepted method for completing OPSEC orientation. It is high recommended personnel seek
   out additional OPSEC training to assist in accomplishing their duties. Information regarding
   required and additional OPSEC training can be received from OPSEC PMs or
   SMO/SMNCOs.
   5.3.2. (ACC) To clarify, the IOSS multimedia product ―An Introduction to OPSEC (An
   Interactive Primer by the Department of Defense) is an accepted method for completing
   OPSEC orientation but not the only method. PMs/SMOs can, and are encouraged to replace
   or augment the IOSS course with locally-produced, tailored training for Coordinators.
   5.3.3. OPSEC Planner Mission Readiness Training (MRT). Personnel working as OPSEC
   planners in an AOC require MRT that encompasses initial qualification training (IQT),
   mission qualification training (MQT), and continuation training (CT). IQT will consist of
   formal training (either SMC or OSPE-2500, OPSEC Analysis and Program Management
   Course). MQT will consist of mission specific training and will be documented via
   Stan/Eval processes. CT will be provided as needed. MRT will be accomplished during
   training exercises.
   5.3.3. (ACC) OPSEC planners who are not also PMs do not require OPSE 2500 but may
   attend at unit‘s expense.
   5.3.4. Quality Assurance Evaluators (QAE) and Contracting Officer Technical
   Representatives (COTR) will complete OPSEC training designed for QAE and COTR duties
   provided by the OPSEC PM/SMO/SMNCO/Coordinator within 90 days of being assigned
   duties. OPSEC PM/SMO/SMNCO/Coordinators are encouraged to use the training located
   on Defense Acquisition University - "CLC 107, OPSEC Contract Requirements"
   https://learn.dau.mil/html/clc/Clc1.jsp along with any specific unit tailored OPSEC
   training.
   5.3.5. Web Site Administrators, Webmasters, and anyone (superiors, public affairs specialist,
   OPSEC coordinators, PMs, SMO/SMNCO, etc.) who has the responsibility to review
   information for public release will complete OPSEC training focused on reviewing
   information to be posted on Internet-based Capabilities. The IOSS OSPE 1500, OPSEC &
   Public Release Decisions and OPSE-3500, OPSEC & Web Risk Assessment are the AF
   acceptable training methods to fulfill this requirement.
5.4. Joint and Interagency OSPEC Support:
   5.4.1. Joint Operations Security Support Center. The Joint OPSEC Support Center (JOSC)
   provides direct support to the Joint Information Operations Warfare Command (JIOWC) and
   Joint Force Commanders through the integration of OPSEC into operations, plans, and
   exercises and by providing staff-level program development and training and OPSEC
   vulnerability assessments when directed. The JOSC serves as the OPSEC Joint Center of

                                            Chapter 6

                                        ASSESSMENTS

6.1. General
   6.1.1. Assessments are performed to achieve two specific purposes: To ensure required
   policies and procedures are in place to protect critical information and to gauge the overall
   effectiveness of countermeasures (See Table 6.1 for OPSEC assessment types).
   6.1.2. The      Air    Force       provides      several      tools    to      assist    OPSEC
   PMs/SMO/SMNCOs/Coordinators and planners to obtain information and data to perform
   risk analysis. These tools assist in assessing the level of exposure of critical information and
   operational indicators to adversary observation, surveillance, and intelligence sensors.
   OPSEC planners, PMs and Coordinators use assessment results within the risk management
   process to determine countermeasures which can mitigate or negate risk to operations.
   6.1.3. Assessment of program effectiveness is accomplished through the development of
   MOP and MOE. MOP are developed to measure how well an activity is performed via the
   execution of countermeasures. MOE measure how well an activity achieved its intended
   effect. Any deficiencies or best practices identified are documented in lessons learned and
   TIPs. Inspector General (IG) inspections are also used to assess organization compliance,
   operational readiness, and nuclear surety. Submit TIPs IAW AFI 11-260.
   6.1.4. OPSEC PMs, SMO/SMNCO and Coordinators will utilize the OPSEC risk assessment
   tool OSCAR to accomplish annual assessments and program reviews.
   6.1.5. For assistance in preparing for inspections and assessments, utilize the OPSEC Core
   Capabilities Checklists provided at the below link to the Air Force Inspection Agency‘s
   (AFIA) web site. The AFIA checklists are divided into functional levels (wing, unit and
   AOC) and provide the basics for maintaining your OPSEC program. MAJCOM and AF IG
   teams      will     utilize   these      checklists    when     conducting       inspections.
   https://webapps.afrc.af.mil/afia/SearchChecklist.aspx?Command=AFIA&Type=CI&St
   ate=live&Dir=A3 .
   6.1.5. (ACC) ACC IG inspections will use the Compliance Inspection Checklists (CIC)
   when inspecting ACC units. ACC expects HQ ACC, NAFs, DRUs, and FOAs to protect
   critical information by following the checklist for their level and, if applicable, as a tenant to
   the installation where they are located. For example, HQ ACC will perform all the policy
   and guidance and program management duties as listed in AFI 10-701 and the core
   compliance checklist for MAJCOMs. In addition, HQ ACC is a tenant unit of JBLE and as
   such will perform the duties of the program Coordinator. Installation inspections should
   include tenant unit programs as well. If there is a non-ACC tenant unit(s), coordinate with
   the tenant‘s HHQ(s) or MAJCOM(s). Tenants should have and be familiar with the host
   unit CIL as well as their own tailored CIL. ACC tenants on an AF installation, to include
   HHQ organizations, are inspectable when the ACC/IG is assessing the host unit‘s OPSEC
   program. Although this supplement is not directive to non-ACC units, should the ACC/IG
   note that non-ACC tenants are not participating in the installation programs the IG will notify
   HQ ACC/A3I who will coordinate with the applicable MAJCOM/DRU OPSEC PMs. It is
   important that all safeguard critical information regardless of organizational differences.
44                                          AFI10-701_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2012


     6.1.5.1. (Added-ACC) ACC OPSEC PMs, SMOs and OPSEC Coordinators are
     required to maintain a continuity book that includes the last three years of data. A
     program that indicate it was only created to ―pass the inspection‖ and does not show
     sustained continuity of the program between inspections will be downgraded. Unit
     programs that fail to comply with OPSEC PM and/or SMO retainability requirements and
     do not had an approved waiver on file will also be documented.
     6.1.5.2. (Added-ACC) HQ ACC approved OPSEC and SM checklists for IG and self-
     inspection reside on the ACC/IG web site on the AF Portal and will be posted on the
     AFRC Management Internal Control Tool (MICT) web site. The ACC CICs are used
     during ACC/IG compliance inspections at all ACC units. HQ ACC/A3I will also post
     these CICs on the ACC OPSEC Community of Practice and/or applicable SharePoint
     sites. Units are encouraged to use these CICs during their internal self-inspection
     processes.
     6.1.5.3. (Added-ACC) ACC GSU groups are designated wing equivalents and will use
     the wing/wing equivalent self-inspection checklist.
  6.1.6. Any request for external assessments must be made through your respective HHQ
  OPSEC PMs.
  6.1.7. MAJCOM OPSEC PMs are the focal point for requesting and scheduling all external
  assessments and setting all priorities between command organizations.
6.2. Annual OPSEC Program Review:
  6.2.1. The Annual OPSEC program review is a continual processes that involve combining
  data collected from MOP, MOE, exercise after action reports, lessons learned, nuclear surety,
  operational readiness/compliance inspections, and annually conducted self-assessments/self-
  inspections. Annual program reviews will be accomplished utilizing OSCAR and report to
  the HHQ OPSEC PM.           This has been assigned Report Control Symbol (RCS) DD-
  INTEL(A) 2228.
  6.2.1. (ACC) Annual OPSEC Program Review Reports for all ACC wings, C-NAFs DRUs
  and FOAs will be forwarded directly to HQ ACC/A3I using skip echelon processes. C-
  NAFs are not to consolidate subordinate wing reviews; however those C-NAFs with
  oversight of RED HORSE Squadron operations should solicit and incorporate their inputs
  into the C-NAF final report. Submit reports, via OSCAR, to HQ ACC/A3I NLT 1 Oct
  annually. If OSCAR is not available then submit via email. To facilitate HHQ reporting
  requirements, do not send reports as an imaged PDF file; instead use WORD ―Save as‖ a
  PDF file option as this will permit text extraction/consolidation and HHQ reporting. Wing
  commander signatures may be imaged or e-signature.
  6.2.2. OPSEC PMs, SMO/SMNCOs, and Coordinators will conduct annual program reviews
  to ensure the health of their program, evaluate compliance with applicable policies and to
  identify short-falls and vulnerabilities.
  6.2.3. Annual OPSEC Program Reviews will provide information relating to the following
  areas:
     6.2.3.1. Executive Summary: Full-time OPSEC PM appointed, budget plan developed,
     level of importance within the organization.
AFI10-701_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                          45


       6.2.3.2. OPSEC Initiatives/Projects/Successes: How is the commander making OPSEC
       a priority? (Policy and guidance, social networking site reviews, etc.)
       6.2.3.3. OPSEC Training and Awareness: Has the commander assigned a fully trained
       SMO/SMNCO to the SMO/SMNCO position? How is OPSEC awareness education and
       training conducted in the organization? (Commander‘s call, unit newsletter, incorporating
       OPSEC into exercises).
       6.2.3.4. OPSEC in Operational Planning: How has the commander incorporated OPSEC
       into the unit‘s operational plans? (Implementing OPSEC measures, unique tools used to
       incorporate OPSEC, integration efforts)
       6.2.3.5. Assessment/Surveys: Does the assigned OPSEC PMs have an established
       OSCAR account? Total number of assessments and surveys accomplished to determine
       the overall effectiveness of the unit‘s OPSEC program?
   6.2.4. At MAJCOM-level, this report will be signed by the Director responsible for the
   MAJCOM‘s OPSEC program or higher-level authority. At wing-level and below the
   commander or their designated representative will sign it.
   6.2.4. (ACC) ACC DRU and FOAs, reports will be signed by the commander. C-NAF
   reports will be signed (at the minimum) by DO/A3.
   6.2.5. (Added-ACC) ACC units will complete and submit to ACC/A3I by 31 August a SM
   self-inspection using the ACC CIC checklists. SMOs will generate a self-inspection report
   on a separate sheet of paper identifying each self inspection item that was marked with a
   ―No‖. The report (see Attachment 13 Self-Inspection Report) will be attached to the self
   inspection checklist. This report states the deficiency, POC, projected corrective action, and
   estimated corrective date. SMOs will also generate a self-inspection report on a separate
   sheet of paper identifying each self inspection item that was marked with a ―Yes‖. The
   report will summarize why the item was in compliance and will be attached to the self
   inspection checklist. All three will be submitted as a single package signed by the
   commander.
6.3. Staff Assistance Visit (SAV):
   6.3.1. SAVs may be conducted as needed by HHQ OPSEC PMs, SMOs or other
   organization SMEs to assist organizations in repairing dormant, non-compliant, deficient
   programs or for any other reason deemed necessary by the commander. The organization
   will request such assistance through their respective chain-of-command and will fund travel.
   SAVs check for program compliance (i.e., Special Interest Items, Air Force Instructions,
   MAJCOM policies, etc.), identify and resolve shortfalls, and provide guidance to OPSEC
   PMs, SMOs, and Coordinators as required.
   6.3.1. (ACC) SAVs may be conducted as needed by HHQ OPSEC PMs, HQ ACC policy is
   to conduct a SAV only when specifically requested by the wing commander. However,
   SAVs may be mandated after major inspections to help correct any identified deficiencies.
   ACC will not conduct SAVs within six-months preceding an inspection in order not to "teach
   the test." SAVs requested by the unit may have to be funded by the unit.
   6.3.2. (Added-ACC) ACC Electronic-SAV (E-SAV):
 46                                            AFI10-701_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2012


      6.3.2.1. (Added-ACC) ACC E-SAVs are a semi-formal unit assessment and vector
      check for compliance items. E-SAVs will not be conducted four months prior to any
      ACC IG Inspection. An E-SAV will quickly assess the health of the unit‘s OPSEC
      program without having to invest the man-hours and cost associated with traditional
      SAVs. Units can receive/request an E-SAV annually. HQ A3I will coordinate an
      appropriate date and time with the OPSEC PM/SMO/Coordinator.
      6.3.2.2. (Added-ACC) Notification will be sent one month prior to the E-SAV. The
      notifications will include documents that will be used for the E-SAV. Inform the unit on
      currency/completeness of any documentation the HHQ OPSEC PM/SMO has on file,
      such as appointment letters and waiver requests, this provides the unit the opportunity to
      update their records prior to the E-SAV date.
6.4. Survey:
   6.4.1. An OPSEC survey is the application of the OPSEC methodology by a team of subject
   matter experts to conduct a detailed analysis of all activities associated with a specific
   organization, operation, activity, exercise, or support function by employing the known
   collection capabilities of potential adversaries. The purpose of an OPSEC survey is to
   determine if OPSEC countermeasures are effectively mitigating identified threats and
   vulnerabilities.
      6.4.1.1. The survey requires a team of experts to look at an activity from an adversary‘s
      perspective to determine if critical information may be disclosed through normal
      operations and functions, to identify vulnerabilities, and propose countermeasures to
      mitigate them.
      6.4.1.2. Survey team members attempt to use the collection techniques and tools of
      known adversaries. Commanders/directors are encouraged to use OPSEC support
      capabilities (reference Paragraph 6.6) to assist in conducting surveys, if available.
6.5. Web Content Vulnerability Analysis:
   6.5.1. Web content vulnerability analysis is a formal, structured        process of evaluating
   information posted on organizational public and private web             sites. This analysis
   complements each organization‘s requirement to have processes            in place ensuring all
   information posted to publicly accessible web sites are reviewed        and approved prior to
   posting.
   6.5.2. Organizations will conduct web content vulnerability analysis of content on their
   organization‘s public and private web sites for its sensitivity (i.e., critical information, For
   Official Use Only, or other controlled unclassified information categories) or sensitivity in
   aggregate to determine potential vulnerabilities by adversary exploitation. Prior to
   conducting a web content vulnerability analysis, follow these guidelines:
      6.5.2.1. Ensure a legal review is conducted by the Judge Advocate (JA) of your web
      vulnerability analysis processes prior to conducting assessments of information on your
      organizational public and private web sites.
      6.5.2.2. Ensure automated key word searching software (i.e. web crawlers) are approved
      for use by the local Systems Integration organization prior to utilization.
AFI10-701_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                             47


      6.5.2.3. If using automated software to retrieve information from web sites, ensure it is
      used only to assess the owning organizations public and private web sites.
      6.5.2.4. Develop strict procedures regarding who can conduct assessments, when the
      assessments will be conducted, what will be done with the information retrieved, who can
      view the information, and how long the information will be maintained on file.
      6.5.2.5. Manage and dispose of information collected and analyzed in accordance with
      AFMAN 33-363, Management and Records and The AF Records Disposition Schedule
      (AFRIMS).
6.6. Support Capabilities:
   6.6.1. Telecommunication Monitoring Assessment Program (TMAP) involves the collection
   and analysis of information transmitted via unsecured and unprotected communications
   systems (email, radio, telephone, and internet-based capabilities) to determine if these
   systems are being used to transmit critical, sensitive or classified information. TMAP helps
   in evaluating an organization‘s OPSEC posture and determining the amounts and types of
   information available to adversary collection entities. TMAP is accomplished only within
   certain legal parameters and may only be performed by authorized personnel. See AFI 10-
   712, Telecommunication Monitoring Assessment Program (TMAP) for further guidance.
   6.6.2. Information Operations Mobile Training Teams (IO MTT) provide a three-phased
   event conducted by the 57th and 177th Information Aggressor Squadrons (57/177 IAS) where
   they assess an organization's network security, physical security, and counter-HUMINT
   capabilities. The first phase is executed remotely through dot-com capabilities and the
   collection and exploitation of open source information; the second phase is accomplished at
   the installation itself and finally through replication of the attack, the 57/177 IAS trains the
   information owners and base personnel on the threat to USAF critical information and their
   responsibilities of securing it. IO MTT identify operation vulnerabilities, operational
   impacts, and exercise threat response procedures. OPSEC PM/SMO/Coordinators use
   information identified by the IO MTT to conduct the OPSEC process.
   6.6.3. HUMINT Vulnerability Assessments (HVA) are used to assess the types and amount
   of information being exposed to potential HUMINT collection with respect to your missions.
      6.6.3.1. Results of these collection capabilities identify the possible level of exposure of
      critical information and operational indicators to adversary observation, surveillance, and
      intelligence sensors. Once analyzed, the information assists in the performance of risk
      assessments for blue forces to develop measures to counter the threat based on
      vulnerabilities identified.
   6.6.4. OSCAR is a web-based tool developed to provide a standardized process to assist the
   OPSEC community with assessing and quantifying risk to critical information allowing decision
   makers to make informed decisions on what countermeasures to implement to reduce the
   organization‘s overall risk and vulnerabilities. OSCAR provides posture, vulnerabilities and risk
   level status, which can provide assistance in developing plans and management reports. It
   provides a platform for planners to test remediation options and scenarios and provides an expert
   knowledge base to assist in threat assessments. All OPSEC program managers are required to
   establish an OSCAR account. OSCAR accounts can be requested by going to the following link:
   https://register.dtic.smil.mil/wobin/WebObjects/RegLite?SiteID=OSCAR on SIPR.

   6.6.5. Organizations will request support through their SMO or OPSEC PM to their
   respective MAJCOM OPSEC PM. MAJCOM OPSEC PMs will submit TMAP requests to
   624 OC/CPD at 624OC/CPD@lackland.af.smil.mil; IO MTT request are submitted to HQ
   ACC/A3I at acc.xoz.iwd@langley.af.mil and HVA requests are submitted IAW procedures
   of your local AFOSI detachment.

                 AIR FORCE OPSEC ANNUAL AWARDS PROGRAM

7.1. General:
   7.1.1. The annual Air Force OPSEC Awards program provides recognition of Air Force
   OPSEC professionals and is a priority for the Air Force OPSEC program. This awards
   program runs concurrently on a fiscal year basis with the National OPSEC Awards program
   conducted by the IOSS. Only AF OPSEC awards submitted by the Air Force OPSEC PM
   will be considered by the IOSS for the National OPSEC Awards.
   7.1.2. Air Force organizations wishing to compete for AF OPSEC annual awards must
   submit nominations through their respective MAJCOMs to reach AF/A3Z-CI, NLT 31 Oct
   each year.
   7.1.2. (ACC) ACC units will submit award nominations through USAFWC, 1 AF, 9 AF, or
   12 AF to arrive at ACC/A3I by 15 October each year.
   7.1.3. The Air Force does not award an AF-level award in the multimedia area. Any Air
   Force organization wishing to compete for the National OPSEC Multimedia Achievement
   Awards must submit nominations through their respective MAJCOM to reach AF/A3Z-CI,
   NLT 15 November to meet the IOSS suspense. Go to http://www.ioss.gov for further
   descriptions of the awards and nomination criteria.
   7.1.3. (ACC) ACC units wishing to compete for the National OPSEC Multimedia

                                           Chapter 8

                    OPSEC REQUIREMENTS WITHIN CONTRACTS

8.1. General:
   8.1.1. Contractors for defense systems acquisition programs as well as other types of Air
   Force contracts will practice OPSEC to protect critical information for specific government
   contracts and subcontracts.
   8.1.2. It is the responsibility of the organization to determine what measures are essential to
   protect critical and sensitive information for specified contracts. Organizations should
   identify OPSEC measures in their requirements documents and ensure they are identified in
   resulting solicitations and contracts. The organization is responsible for ensuring the
   appropriate critical program information; OPSEC measures and costs are billed and tracked
   as a separate line item in all contracts.
8.1. (ACC) General: AFI 10-701, Chapter 8 establishes requirements for ―the organization‖ to
include contract requirements. ACC adds these responsibilities to the MAJCOM, C-NAF, DRU,
FOA, wing, and GSU group commanders that have responsibility to establish and maintain an
OPSEC program/SM office and to his PM/SMO. The commander may designate, in writing, one
or more individuals to perform these roles for him but the responsibility remains with the
commander. In the absence of assigning the contractual requirements to another office, the
OPSEC PM/SMO will be the office responsible for carrying out the commander‘s guidance on
the Chapter 8 contractual requirements.
8.2. Guidance and procedures:
   8.2.1. Organizations will consider OPSEC for all contractual requirements. They must first
   determine whether there is any form of critical or sensitive information or activities involved
   in the contract. It is the organization‘s responsibility to inform the contracting officer when a
   determination has been made that there are no OPSEC requirements for the contract.
   8.2.2. If there are OPSEC requirements, the organization is responsible for conducting an
   OPSEC review of the Statement of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statement (PWS)
   prior to the time the contracting officer publicizes the SOW or PWS. The SOW/PWS is a
   publicly released document that can reveal critical information or indicators of critical
   information. It is critical that the organization OPSEC PM or SMO identify OPSEC
   requirements in the scope of work.
   8.2.3. The organization will specify OPSEC requirements for classified contracts on DD
   Form 254, Department of Defense Contract Security Classification Specification. This form
   defines classification, regarding, downgrading, declassification, and OPSEC specifications
   for a contract. Though the DD Form 254 applies to classified contracts, and classified
   subcontracts, it may also be used for unclassified contracts to specify OPSEC requirements.
   For unclassified contracts, if the DD Form 254 is not used, the organization will define the
   specific OPSEC requirements in the contract and the SOW/PWS.
   8.2.4. The organization‘s designated representative is responsible for preparation of the
   prime contract‘s DD Form 254. Based on the classification guidance or OPSEC
   requirements in the prime contract, the prime contractor is responsible for preparation of DD
52                                           AFI10-701_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2012


  Forms 254 for any subcontracts. This should be done in coordination with the organization‘s
  SMO or OPSEC PM and security manager.
  8.2.5. The organization will state OPSEC requirements on DD Form 254, contracts and
  SOW/PWSs with sufficient detail to ensure complete contractor understanding of the exact
  OPSEC provisions or measures required by the organization. If the OPSEC block is checked
  on the DD Form 254, the organization shall:
     8.2.5.1. Task the contractor to develop an OPSEC program plan to address how the
     contractor plans to protect critical and sensitive contracted information, and upon
     organization acceptance, implement the OPSEC program plan.
     8.2.5.2. Provide OPSEC guidance for the contractors to use in developing their own
     OPSEC plan.
  8.2.6. The organization will determine OPSEC requirements when the contract involves
  sensitive information. When it does, the organization will ensure that the contract and
  SOW/PWS include OPSEC requirements, which must include establishing an OPSEC
  training program to protect the organization‘s critical information.
  8.2.7. For a contractor to effectively comply with OPSEC provisions of the contract, the
  organization must provide the following guidance:
     8.2.7.1. Organization‘s critical information.
     8.2.7.2. Adversaries‘ collection threat information as it applies to the organization‘s
     mission and the contract.
     8.2.7.3. Operations security guidance (at a minimum, the organization will provide a
     copy of this instruction).
     8.2.7.4. Specific OPSEC measures the organization requires (as appropriate).
  8.2.8. (Added-ACC) Unit commanders should ensure OPSEC PM and/or Coordinators
  work with the contracting officers when writing contract documents such as Requests for
  Proposal and Statements of Work. Critical information should not be included in
  unclassified contract documents to reduce the vulnerability of that information being
  released. Contracting officers should have all unit CILs and will compare their unclassified
  documents to those lists to ensure critical information is not included. Commanders are
  responsible for their critical information. Unit OPSEC PM or Coordinator will review the
  documents before release.

the direct effect level, MOEs answer such questions as, ―was the intended direct effect of the
mission e.g., target destruction, degradation (to a defined point), or delay (for a given time)
created?‖ At the indirect level, they may answer things like, ―has the enemy IADS been
degraded sufficiently to allow unimpeded air operations above 15,000 feet?‖ (AFDD 2)
Measures of Performance (MOP)—Objective or quantitative measures assigned to the actions
and against which the action‘s accomplishment, in operations or mission terms, is assessed.
MOPs answer questions like, ―were the weapons released as intended on the planned target?‖
(AFDD 2)
Operations Security (OPSEC)—OPSEC is a process of identifying, analyzing and controlling
critical information indicating friendly actions associated with military operations and other
activities to: Identify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems;
Determine what specific indications could be collected, analyzed and interpreted to derive
critical information in time to be useful to adversaries; Select and execute measures that
eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the vulnerabilities of friendly actions to adversary
exploitation.
OPSEC Assessment— An evaluative process, conducted annually of an organization, operation,
activity, exercise, or support function to determine if sufficient protection measures are in place
to protect critical information. An OPSEC program review may include self-generated program
reviews, Inspector General inspections, or higher headquarters reviews that specifically address
OPSEC.
OPSEC Compromise—The disclosure of critical information or sensitive information which
has been identified by the information owner (commander/director) and any higher headquarters
that jeopardizes the unit‘s ability to execute its mission or to adequately protect its personnel
and/or equipment. Critical or sensitive information that has been compromised and is available
in open sources and the public domain should not be highlighted or referenced publicly outside
of intra-governmental or authorized official communications because these actions provide
further unnecessary exposure of the compromised information.
OPSEC Coordinator—Acts as an interface to direct and manage all relevant OPSEC matters
below the wing-level and reports to the SMO or OPSEC PM.
OPSEC Indicator—Friendly detectable actions and open-source information that can be
interpreted or pieced together by an adversary to derive critical information.
OPSEC Measure—Methods and means to gain and maintain essential secrecy about critical
information.
OPSEC Program Manager—Focal point for all OPSEC related matters at an organization
above the squadron level that is not a wing. Ensures OPSEC requirements are in compliance as
directed and reviews organizational plans to ensure OPSEC is appropriately considered.
OPSEC Planner—An individual who has been formally trained in the planning and execution
of OPSEC.
OPSEC Survey— An OPSEC survey is the application of the OPSEC methodology by a team
of subject matter experts to conduct a detailed analysis of all activities associated with a specific
organization, operation, activity, exercise, or support function by employing the known
collection capabilities of potential adversaries.
AFI10-701_ACCSUP_I 17 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                              59


OPSEC Vulnerability—A condition in which friendly actions provide OPSEC indicators that
may be obtained and accurately evaluated by an adversary in time to prove a basis for effective
adversary decision making.
Risk—A measure of the potential degree to which protected information is subject to loss
through adversary exploitation.
Risk Analysis—A method by which individual vulnerabilities are compared to perceived or
actual security threat scenarios in order to determine the likelihood of compromise of critical
information.
Risk Assessment—A process of evaluating the risks to information based on susceptibility to
intelligence collection and the anticipated severity of loss.
Sensitive Information— Unclassified information requiring special protection from disclosure
that could cause compromise or threat to our national security, an Air Force organization,
activity, military member, AF civilian, DoD contractor, or family member.
Signature—Observable activities and operational trends that reveal critical information to
adversary intelligence collection.
Signature Management (SM)—the active defense or exploitation of operational profiles
resident at a given military installation. Defense of operational profiles is accomplished by
implementing protective SM measures to deny adversary collection of critical information.
Exploitation of operational profiles is accomplished by using Deception in Support of OPSEC
(DISO) to protect critical information.
Signature Management Officer/Noncommissioned Officer (SMO/SMNCO)— Focal point
for all SM related matters at the wing or installation level. Ensures tactical level OPSEC and
MILDEC requirements are in compliance as directed and reviews wing or installation level plans
to ensure OPSEC and MILDEC are appropriately considered to actively defend or exploit
operational profiles resident at a given military installation.
Threat—the capability of an adversary coupled with his intentions to undertake any actions
detrimental to the success of program activities or operations.
Threat Assessment—an evaluation of the intelligence collection threat to a program activity,
system, or operation.
Vulnerability Analysis—In information operations, a systematic examination of an information
system or product to determine the adequacy of security measures, identify security deficiencies,
provide data from which to predict the effectiveness of proposed security measures, and confirm
the adequacy of such measures after implementation. See also information operations,
information system, security, and vulnerability.
Vulnerability Assessment—A process that examines a friendly operation or activity from the
point of view of an adversary, seeking ways in which the adversary might determine critical
information in time to disrupt or defeat the operation or activity.
Web Vulnerability Analysis—Process of evaluating information intended for release outside
the control of the organization, including release to the public, i.e., public and private web sites.
Working Group—Designated body representing a broad range of line and staff activities within
an organization that provides advice and support to leadership and all elements of the

MEMORANDUM FOR HQ ACC/A3I

FROM: {Unit}/CC

SUBJECT: Request for Waiver to Signature Management Officer (SMO) [Signature
Management NCO (SMNCO); OPSEC Program Manager (PM)] Retainability Requirement

1. AFI-10-701, Operations Security and AFI 10-704, Military Deception both require the SMO
[SMNCO, PM] to have two years retainability from the date of appointment. This requirement is
driven by training costs, return on investment, as well as health of the program since high
turnover negatively affects the programs‘ effectiveness.

2. I am unable to appoint a SMO [SMNCO or PM] that meets the retainabilty requirement for
the following reasons: [include rank, name of individual to be appointed with this waiver,
expected date of departure, reason for departure, why another individual cannot be appointed that
can meet the retainability requirement, and any other pertinent information.]

3. Request a waiver be granted to [unit requesting waiver] for [rank, name] until [estimated
date]. At that time I intend to meet the requirement by [state corrective actions that will bring
the units program into compliance].



                                                                             [Signature]

Note: Electronic continuity books are authorized and encouraged. The overall structure (folder
hierarchy) of the e-book should match this attachment. At the PM/SMO‘s discretion, hard copies
of critical sections may be maintained. A hard-copy showing the network path/route to the e-
book is mandatory. (For example: \\lfi-cs-
fas01\shared\myopsecprogram\best%20continuity%20binder%20ever)
Note: If the file is not actually put in the continuity book (either hard copy or electronic
continuity book) then specify at the appropriate Tab the location of the file. This could be
because of the large size of the file/document or because its classification precludes including in
the unclassified book/e-book. Example for a hard copy file location might be ―IV 2 Threat
Assessment (S) found in Safe #3, Drawer 2, OPSEC folder, documents 2-5‖. An example of an
electronic file might be ―IV 2 Threat Assessment (S) found in XP sharedrive O-- \\lfi-cs-
fas01\shared\/XP/OPSEC/Threat assessment.‖
Note: A unit Coordinator should have a continuity book also but it does not need to contain all
of the same content. Items below marked with an asterisk should be in a unit Coordinator
continuity book.

                                 SMWG MASTER ROSTER

A9.1. Note: The SMWG roster that starts on the next page is a list of typical flying wing‘s
subject matter experts (SMEs) that should be considered as part of the unit SMWG. Although
the list is based on a flying unit, ACC unit SM personnel need to remember to identify, train, and
exercise SMWG personnel from all non-flying support units and functions within the wing as
well to ensure a complete wing SM capability. Remember that the example list is not all-
inclusive and may need to be amended to suit your particular unit location, mission, or
organizational structure. You may not need to use each and every functional area SME for a
particular SM exercise/operation, but you should try to work through the lower echelon group
and squadron commanders to have them appoint someone as a SMWG member. The SMWG
roster should also include tenant units assigned on the host installation. Where the ACC unit is
tenant on a non-ACC base, the ACC unit‘s SM personnel must include the host unit SM
personnel as part of the ACC units SMWG. The SMWG master roster will be maintained as a
FOUO document when filled in with personnel data. The following privacy act statement must
be added to the roster when filled in with personal data. ―This document contains FOR
OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO) information which must be protected under the Privacy

FROM: (Your Wing)

Subject: (Signature Management Training Exercise Supporting Exercise Camel Jockey) or
(Signature Management Quarterly Training Exercise, FY 12/1) (U)

   1. (Classification) Overall Situation: This paragraph will contain a brief synopsis of the
      actual exercise taking place that SM will support. List the objective(s) of this exercise
      (objectives are t hose of the actual exercises, not the SM objectives).

   2. (Classification) Critical Information: List the critical information associated with the
      supported exercise (if no supporting exercise, critical information associated with the
      Wig that requires SMC support).

   3. (Classification) SM Collaboration: This paragraph will identify the tactics, techniques
      and procedures that will be used to protect the critical information. (i.e. Hangar four will
      hide/cover the identity of the deploying force, face to face communications will protect
      the coordination process for the deploying force or uniforms will be changed to hide
      actual identity of forces (patches/hats).

   4. (Classification) Base Threat Assessment: List the current threats that are present in the
      area that possibly collect information on your base. Data of this type may be found in the
      Base Threat Assessment published by OSI at the following website:
      Http://www.afosi.af.smil.mil/threatcenter/

   5. (Classification) SM Working Group (Trusted Agent) Composition: List all members
      with a working knowledge of the protective or exploitation measure(s) and those that will
      be used to portray events to assist the plan.

  6. (Classification) Exercise Overview: Discuss how you envision the SM scenario to
     unfold, (i.e. cover story presented, backstopping done to reinforce the cover story).
     Attach a draft/working copy of the developed SM execution checklist.

  7. (Classification) Feedback. Develop Measures of Performance (MOP). List the
     Measures that will be used to judge the performance of the SM execution checklist. (i.e.
     Was the Hangar guard posted at the exact time indicated on the checklist?)

  8. (Classification) After Action Report (AARs): Will include an evaluation of all of the
     above and any ideas for improvement. MOPs should be evaluated as to if an action item
     was to happen at a certain time or location, and did it take place, and as planned. AARs
     will be submitted within 15 days following termination of the exercise.

  9.       Cost estimates, if any, will include specific US dollar amounts for each person that
       directly supports the SM activity (i.e. per diem, travel, rental vehicles, lodging, etc.)

             Table A11.1. Signature Management Execution Checklist.
LEGEND:
   D-Day = Unnamed day on which a particular operation commences or is to commence. Examples D-5, D, D+10
  INDICATORS: clues that cause disclosure of critical information by attracting the adversary‘s attention.
      Signatures = Uniqueness (reduces the number of other indicators that must be observed to confirm a single indicator‘s significance)
     Observables = events, activities, or elements of information that can be ―seen‖ (perceived) by the target and his supporting information
system.
     Critical Information = factual information about friendly activities or operations
     Associations = relationships of an indicator to other information
     Profiles = functional activities that create unique signatures and associations which form one unique profile
     Contrasts = any difference between standard profile and current actions; deviations attract interest; why is there a change?
     Exposure = when and how long; observed duration, repetition and timing – limiting exposure reduces observable detail and
associations
  Termination implications = Consider both favorable and adverse circumstances that may arise during the course of the exercise/operation
 MOP (Measures of Performance) = measurements to determine the performance of a system/operation. Determine whether the planned
tasks were executed in the correct manner, at the correct time.
 MOE (Measures of Effectiveness) = measurements to determine the result/effects of a system/operation. Critical to understanding
whether or not the desired result/effect was achieved
