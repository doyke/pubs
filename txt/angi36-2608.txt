Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL)—Evolution of distributed learning (distance learning)
that emphasizes collaboration on standards-based versions of reusable objects, networks, and
learning management systems, yet may include some legacy methods and media. ADL leverages
the full power of computers, information, and communication technologies through the use of
common standards in order to provide learning that can be tailored to individual needs and
delivered anywhere-anytime. ADL also includes establishing an interoperable “computer-
managed instruction” environment that supports the needs of developers, learners, instructors,
administrators, managers, and family. ADL encompasses all the methodologies mentioned
above, and in addition, includes ongoing and expected improvements in learning methods.

environments and solve ill-defined problems by using critical thought and reasoned judgment.
Education programs prepare Airmen to anticipate and successfully meet challenges across the
range of military operations and build a professional corps. Further, they positively impact both
recruitment and retention efforts.
Experience—Active participation/involvement in positions, events, or activities leading to the
accumulation of knowledge or skill that can be utilized to meet mission requirements.
Force Development Construct—Direct, concise philosophy for linking the Airman’s
perspective with defined competencies and processes to prepare Airmen to successfully meet war
fighter requirements. Development is delivered through a repetitive process that involves the
CoL.
Functional Management Structure—The Functional Authority, Functional Manager,
Development Team, Career Field Manager, functional assignment/management team and other
career field stakeholders at the enterprise level who provide a corporate perspective of
institutional requirements, career field-specific policy and guidance, and day-to-day management
of their specific career field(s) in order to ensure Airmen within their functional community are
equipped, developed, and sustained to provide AF capabilities.
Instructor Certification Program (ICP)—The purpose of the ICP Course is to prepare and
qualify personnel to perform instructor duties on a part-time basis. ICP is a10 training day course
that introduces students to the philosophy, methodologies and practice of the Instructional
Systems Design model. ICP is a CCAF accredited (four credits in Instructor Fundamentals).
Instructional System Development (ISD)—Systematic process that guides the development,
implementation, management, and evaluation of training programs.

Institutional Competencies (ICs)—Common taxonomy used to implement the CoL. These
leadership competencies are expected of all Airmen, throughout their careers, and will be the
competencies needed to operate successfully in the constantly changing environment in which
they function. The three categories of these competencies are mapped to the Air Force leadership
levels.
Occupational Competencies—A set of competencies required of all Airmen within a specific
workforce category (a group of functions requiring similar work, i.e. engineering). They describe
technical/functional skills, knowledge, abilities, behaviors, and other characteristics needed to
perform that function’s mission successfully.
Professional Continuing Education (PCE)—Any course that is less than 20 weeks in duration
and satisfies mission accomplishment, sustainment, or enhancement as required by law, Air
Force governance, specific memorandum of agreement, or position requirement. PCE should not
be confused with initial skills and subsequent advanced training courses that are required to
advance in the Air Force Specialty Code skill level.
Professional Military Education (PME)—Critical subset of developmental education that: 1)
provides the nation with personnel skilled in the employment of air, space, and cyberspace power
in the conduct of war, small scale contingencies, deterrence, peacetime operations, and national
security; 2) provides AF personnel with the skills and knowledge to make sound decisions in
progressively more demanding leadership positions within the national security environment;
and 3) develops strategic thinkers, planners, and war fighters. In addition, PME programs
strengthen the ability and skills of AF personnel to lead, manage, and supervise.
Satellite EPME (SatEPME)—A blended EPME experience consisting of a 14 week live
satellite broadcast followed by two weeks of in-residence, providing graduates in-resident credit
for NCOA.
Training—Set of events or activities presented in a structured or planned manner through one or
more media for the attainment and retention of skills, knowledge, and attitudes required to meet
job performance requirements. This involves the coaching and mentoring of Airmen, resulting in
proficiency development.
Warrior Network—The ANG commercial satellite enterprise that provides education, training
and command information.

                       INSTITUTIONAL COMPETENCY (IC) LIST

A2.1. Elements of the Continuum of Learning (CoL) have long been institutionalized and are
providing useful and important contributions to the development of Airmen. The ICs are
essential to operate successfully across the widest array of Air Force tasks and requirements.
Various programs delivering the ICs will assist in the development of Airmen over the course of
their careers (from AFDD 1-1, Leadership and Force Development, Appendix C).
