                                                Chapter 1

                                              OVERVIEW

1.1. Mission. Provide USAF aircrew safe and effective ALS systems and programs. To protect and sus-
tain human life during flight operations. Prepares aircrew and passengers to survive, affect their rescue,
and return to duty if forced to abandon their aircraft during an emergency.

1.2. Program Objectives:
    1.2.1. Increase combat capability of the total weapon system by enhancing the performance of the air-
    crew.
    1.2.2. Reduce injuries and increase survival rates by providing aircrew and passengers with the best
    equipment available through new technologies and system training.
    1.2.3. Identify requirements for modernization and new equipment by analyzing: customer-validated
    operational requirements, operational deficiencies, USAF suggestions and recommendations, Air
    Force technical order (T.O.) improvement reports, aircraft mishap report recommendations, and joint
    developmental programs from other DOD agencies.
    1.2.4. Train aircrew and passengers to use their aircrew life support equipment (ALSE) in a manner,
    which reinforces recall during emergency situations. Training should be accomplished using training
    equipment that mirrors operational equipment and realistic scenarios, which aircrew and passengers
    are likely to encounter. Realistic training will ensure aircrew and passengers have confidence in their
    equipment and their ability to use it.
    1.2.5. Train and qualify ALS personnel (Air Force Specialty Code [AFSC] 1T1X1) to maintain ALSE
    in optimum condition and to conduct aircrew life support continuation training (ALSCT).

1.3. Supplements and Waivers:

                             UNIT ALS PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

3.1. Purpose. This chapter provides guidance to assist ALS personnel in administering key areas neces-
sary for effective management of the ALS program.

3.2. Budgeting:
   3.2.1. Each ALS organization must use established DOD and USAF budgeting procedures to ensure
   proper funding of their ALS program.
   3.2.2. Each ALS activity will prepare and submit a detailed annual budget and financial plan to their
   appropriate commanders and resource advisors. Submit unfunded requirements during mid-year and
   end-of-year calls IAW MAJCOM procedures.

3.3. Supply Accounts:
   3.3.1. Each ALS section, to include the Operations Support Squadron (OSS) ALS staff supporting
   training functions, will budget for and establish their own supply account as specified by AFMAN
   23-110, Vol 2, Part 13, Chapter 8.
   3.3.2. When appropriate, local contingency plans will include qualified ALS technicians who will
   assume supply custodial responsibilities at deployed ALS shops.
   3.3.3. Ensure custodians receive base supply customer training as needed IAW AFMAN 23-110, Vol-
   ume 2, Part 13, and the Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA) site at:
   https://etca.randolph.af.mil/.
   3.3.4. Develop procedures to track supply, equipment and clothing expenditures so as to provide
   quantitative requirements to the unit commander and resource manager to assist in and justify budget-
   ing and funding requirements.
   3.3.5. Ensure a Configuration Data File is maintained for each supply account to show a breakdown
   of how each equipment item’s authorization was determined (i.e., number of personnel assigned,
   number of aircraft [primary aircraft inventory (PAI)] assigned, number of crewmembers supported,
   designed operational capability [DOC] statements, operations plans [OPLAN], and UTCs tasked to
   support). Continuous emphasis is needed to properly control equipment. Refer to AFH 170-1,
   Resource Manager’s Handbook (projected to be AFPAM 65-605).
   3.3.6. Each supply account custodian must work with base supply to ensure applicable force activity
   designators (FAD) code is used when requisitioning ALSE. This will ensure mission essential ALSE
   and mobility equipment that is backordered and required for direct support of flying operations is
   available. When ordering time-change items, use TEX Code 8 to by-pass base level stock (if remain-
   ing service-life is inadequate to meet mission needs) and advice code “2G” to ensure assets received
   from depot have the most service-life remaining on item.
   3.3.7. Report time-change component requirements IAW T.O. 00-20-9 and HHQs directives. AFRC
   associate units will provide information copies to their respective AFRC NAF.
   3.3.8. Use AS 016 and AS 450, aircraft configuration instructions, mission requirements, logistics
   details (LOGDET), MAJCOM specific guidance, and this instruction to determine the basis of equip-
22                                                AFI11-301V1_439AWSUP_I 29 NOVEMBER 2002


     ment required. An additional 10 percent (a minimum of one set when equipment is required to be des-
     ignated in sets) is authorized for change-outs to minimize aircraft down times. Units having an
     OPLAN or contingency plan (CONPLAN) tasking will use the following for mobility authorizations:
     items in column "A" in AS 016G and AS 450 are items used to support mobility UTC LOGDET
     requirements (items you would put on a pallet and deploy) and all accountable “individually sized”
     ACDE (except for ACDE assets required for training). These mobility items will be coded "Use Code
     A" on your custodian authorization/custody receipt listing (CA/CRL). Max number of "parent" UTC
     tasked items authorized in approved LOGDET. Multiply this number "times" ten percent for equip-
     ment maintenance spares. If that number is below one total set, units are authorized to exceed that
     quantity to make a complete set, but will not exceed the next whole set.
     3.3.9. Each supply account custodian must submit supply difficulty and mission impact letters when
     experiencing delays receiving supplies and equipment.

3.4. Air Force Cost Analysis Improvement Group/Cost Per Flying Hour (AFCAIG/CPFH) Pro-
gram:
     3.4.1. Aircraft ALSE components that are pre-positioned aboard aircraft, such as parachutes, survival
     kits, and life rafts, will be included as logistics Cost Per Flying Hour (CPFH) factors.
     3.4.2. MAJCOM ALS and LG AFCAIG/CPFH managers will develop a coordinated list of National
     Stock Numbers (NSN) that will be authorized as AFCAIG/CPFH ALS cost factors using the federal
     supply group exclusion list. These will be the only items authorized to be procured using flying-hour
     Materiel Support Division (MSD) EEIC 644, EEIC 619 IMPAC, and General Support Division (GSD)
     EEIC 609 funds. Any items not on the AFCAIG/CPFH ALS listing will be considered as non-fly
     items.
     3.4.3. Cost Accounting: AFCAIG/CPFH Flying RC/CC X12L0X will be used to account for ALS
     requirements. Each unit must establish an organizational code under the LG AFCAIG/CPFH Project
     Funds Management Record (PFMR) in standard base supply system (SBSS). The organization code
     should be established with type organization “7”. Separate ALS planning numbers are developed and
     indicated on unit funding documents. Fly and non-fly funds will be tracked and managed separately
     since separate budget processes will be used.
     3.4.4. Budget and Funding Distribution: AFCAIG/CPFH ALS items will be incorporated into the
     AFCAIG/CPFH Annual Call process for identifying requirements. MAJCOM ALS managers will
     task unit ALS managers, consolidate total requirements, and submit requirements to the MAJCOM
     LG AFCAIG/CPFH manager for inclusion and preparation of an AFCAIG/CPFH adjustment for each
     MDS. Funding for all fly ALS requirements will be considered a part of the unit LG total flying hour
     program allocation but will flow through the FM; which will be responsible to load the dollars against
     the proper organizational code.
     3.4.5. Program Management and Reporting: Unit ALS has responsibility to notify the LG AFCAIG/
     CPFH Analyst/Resource Advisor of any unfunded AFCAIG/CPFH ALS requirements or potential
     excess funds. Unit LG AFCAIG/CPFH Analyst/Resource Advisor has responsibility to coordinate
     with the unit ALS and include the new AFCAIG/CPFH ALS RC/CC status of funds in their monthly
     AFCAIG/CPFH report. Unit LG AFCAIG/CPFH Analyst/Resource Advisor will include the
     AFCAIG/CPFH ALS items in their D26 program retrieval.

3.5. Equipment Redistribution. In the event ALSE becomes excess to organizational needs, the LSS
will notify respective MAJCOM, ANG, or NAF FMS for possible redistribution prior to turn-in.

3.6. Transfer of ALSE:
   3.6.1. During aircraft transfers or movement of ALSE, communication between depot, modification

   lesson plans based on current safety information provided by the Air Force Safety Center.
   5.2.2. ALSCT instructors may be an LSO, instructor aircrew, or ALS training instructor. MAJCOMs
   will supplement this instruction with requirements for assigning and certifying ALSCT instructors.

5.3. ALSCT Event Descriptions. Lead commands, IAW AFPD 10-9, Lead Operating Command
Weapon Systems Management, will be OPR for developing core curriculum for each of the following
blocks of instruction. ALSCT event instruction may be consolidated as long as curriculum requirements
are met and individual events are tracked by the designated identifiers in Air Force Operations Resource
Management System (AFORMS). Lead commands will provide ALSCT event guidance in applicable
AFI 11-2MDS-series, Vol 1 publications.
   5.3.1. Life Support Familiarization Training (LSFT) (LL01) (previously Local Area Survival Train-
   ing, LS01): One time event, per base assignment, conducted prior to the first flight at home station to
   familiarize aircrew members with local ALS equipment availability, issue, use, pre-flight, and
   post-flight procedures. This training will be provided for subsequent re-assignments to the same base.
   5.3.2. Emergency Egress Training, Ejection Seat (LL02) (formerly LS07): Evaluates aircrew and pas-
   senger ability to demonstrate proficiency in air and ground emergency egress/ejection procedures. In
   aircraft with multi-crew ejection seat capability, stress importance of aircrew coordination actions in
   emergency situations. Ensure aircrews are aware of their responsibilities for conducting safety and
   passenger briefings IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules.
   5.3.3. Emergency Egress Training, Non-Ejection (LL03) (formerly LS08): Evaluates aircrew and
   passenger ability to demonstrate proficiency in air and ground emergency egress procedures. Stress
   the importance of aircrew coordination, aircrew and passenger responsibilities and use of appropriate
   emergency egress equipment. Ensure aircrews are aware of their responsibilities for conducting safety
   and passenger briefings IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3.
   5.3.4. Aircrew Chemical Defense Training (ACDT) (LL04) (formerly LS04): An academic and
   equipment training session in which the aircrew member demonstrates and performs donning, doff-
   ing, buddy dressing procedures using either the first or second generation ACDE or aircrew eye/respi-
   ratory protection (AERP) equipment. This training also includes information on hazards and

     limitations of wearing the equipment properly and improperly, preflight procedures, aircraft integra-
     tion, and parachute descent emergency procedures. Each aircrew will demonstrate procedures during
     their initial class; subsequent classes require a minimum of 10% of aircrew participants to dress out
     and demonstrate aircrew contamination control area (ACCA) processing procedures.
     5.3.5. Egress Training with ACDE (LL05) (formerly LS05): Evaluates the aircrew’s ability to dem-
     onstrate proficiency in the use of primary as well as secondary air and ground egress procedures while
     wearing ACDE. Training will stress the unique changes in procedures to include added difficulties air-
     crew would and could experience as a result of wearing ACDE.
     5.3.6. Aircrew Life Support Equipment (ALSE) Training (LL06) (formerly LS06): An academic and
     equipment training event, in which aircrew members demonstrate their ability to locate, preflight, and
     use all aircrew and passenger ALSE carried aboard unit aircraft or issued to aircrew members. This
     training includes the limitations and safety issues related to ALSE. Additionally, include aircrew
     clothing items and information on hazards associated with improper wear and failure to use only
     authorized clothing and equipment items.
     5.3.7. Former ALSCT courses (LS02) High Threat Combat Survival Training (CST); (LS03) Water
     Survival Training (WST); (LS09) Hanging Harness Training (HHT), Ejection; (LS10) HHT,
     Non-Ejection; (LS11) Low Threat CST; and (LS13) Helicopter Emergency Egress Training require-
     ments and identifiers are included in AFI 16-1301, Survival Evasion Resistance Escape (SERE) Oper-
     ations (forthcoming). LS02 and LS11 are combined as SS02, Combat Survival Training (CST). LS03
     is now SS05, Water Survival Training (WST). SS05 also incorporates LS13 as required by unit type.
     LS09 and LS10 are incorporated as SS06, Emergency Parachute Training (EPT).

5.4. Formal Training Requirements:
     5.4.1. All aircrew members must attend formal training requirements as identified in AFI 16-1301
     (forthcoming).
     5.4.2. All ALSCTI must meet the minimum formal training requirements contained in Table 4.1. of
     this instruction and be assigned using guidelines established by respective MAJCOMs.
     5.4.3. To obtain formal course allocations for ALS personnel, forward the full name, rank, social
     security account number (SSAN), and organization of personnel requiring training to the appropriate
     MAJCOM ALS focal point at least 60 days in advance of the requested training date. AFRC and ANG
     will request quotas IAW AFRC and ANG procedures.
     5.4.4. The group LSO or LSS will control and manage the wing’s ALS related formal course alloca-
     tions. Cancellations or substitutions will be accomplished by contacting the appropriate MAJCOM or
     ANG ALS focal point not later than 30 days prior to class start date. Return all allocations that cannot
     be used to the appropriate MAJCOM or ANG ALS focal point for redistribution at least 30 days prior
     to class start date.

5.5. ALSCT Requirements:
     5.5.1. Minimum Training Requirements. Table 5.1. of this instruction specifies the required
     ALSCT events and frequencies for aircrew members and passengers.
     5.5.2. Failure to accomplish ALSCT at the required intervals will result in grounding or non-combat
     mission ready status as outlined in the respective AFI 11-2MDS-series, Vol 1 instructions. If an air-
AFI11-301V1_439AWSUP_I 29 NOVEMBER 2002                                                                    33


   crew member is deploying TDY to perform flying duties at a location where a training capability does
   not exist, the required training must be accomplished prior to home station departure. If an aircrew
   member is deployed past their training currency date, they must receive training in the grounding
   events prior to first flight at home station.
   5.5.3. If an aircrew member, current in all ALSCT events, is TDY to perform flying duties to a loca-
   tion where a training capability does not exist and the individual becomes due in an ALSCT event,
   training must be accomplished before first flight at home station. AFRC and ANG functional manag-
   ers will determine time frame required to complete training upon arrival at home station.
   5.5.4. Emergency Egress and Parachute Descent Training (PDT) (formally HHT) should be given
   concurrently when practical (ejection or non-ejection aircraft).
   5.5.5. Flight Surgeons will receive ALSCT at frequencies determined IAW MDS-specific guidance.
   5.5.6. Aircrew members arriving PCS or visiting aircrews, such as those assigned to the inspector
   general, test squadrons, etc., are not required to re-accomplish egress or PDT if source documentation
   of currency can be obtained (e.g., AFORMS) and they are current in the assigned aircraft. However,
   training on local unit specific ALSE and rescue requirements will be accomplished.
   5.5.7. Aircrew members previously qualified in a given ejection seat equipped aircraft and currently
   in transition to a different model of the aircraft, or undergoing upgrade training in the same type of air-
   craft, may receive egress training at the regular interval from date last accomplished, if the escape sys-
   tems and procedures are the same in both aircraft models.
   5.5.8. Aircrew members in transition from one type of ejection seat equipped aircraft to another and
   awaiting a Fighter Training Unit (FTU) slot will receive Emergency Egress and PDT at intervals
   determined by respective MAJCOM.
   5.5.9. Student aircrew members assigned to an FTU will receive emergency egress and PDT training
   IAW applicable syllabus.
   5.5.10. Initial and periodic ACDE training will be conducted IAW appropriate 11-2MDS-series, Vol
   1 publications, this instruction, applicable T.O.s and approved instructor guides.
   5.5.11. An aircrew member may be credited with ACDT (LL04) during local operational readiness
   exercises provided all ALSCT requirements and objectives are satisfied.
   5.5.11. (439AW) Aircrew members will be credited with ACDT (LL04) for participation during local
   operational readiness exercises provided all ALSCT requirements and objectives are satisfied.

5.6. ALSCT Safety. Safety is paramount when planning and conducting ALSCT. As a minimum, the fol-
lowing will apply:
   5.6.1. The group LSO or LSS, with assistance from the local safety office, will ensure Operational
   Risk Management (ORM) or other risk management programs or techniques is fully implemented,
   documented in unit instructor guides (IG) or lesson plans (LP), and tailored to their specific operation
   and location for all ALSCT events.
   5.6.2. The LSS will develop and publish an Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for use during any train-
   ing event where injury is likely, e.g., ALSE class if signal flares are activated. The EAP will be
   included in the IG or LP, briefed by the lead instructor prior to each training event and understood by
   every instructor and student prior to event start.

5.7. Passenger and Incentive Flyer Training:
     5.7.1. Passengers scheduled for flight aboard ejection seat equipped aircraft will receive, as a mini-
     mum, egress, PDT, and ALSE training no earlier than 72 hours prior to flight. If the 72 hours are
     exceeded before flight, training will be re-accomplished. Egress includes manual bailout procedures
     training, if applicable.
     5.7.2. Non-rated personnel who fly occasionally to perform official duties (e.g., enroute ground sup-
     port, security, etc.) will receive egress, PDT, and ALSE training at intervals determined by respective
     MAJCOM.
     5.7.3. Passengers scheduled for flight aboard non-ejection seat equipped aircraft will be briefed on
     emergency procedures and ALSE as depicted in appropriate aircraft passenger briefing guides. The
     aircraft commander or their designated representative may conduct this briefing.

5.8. Training Documentation:
     5.8.1. All completed ALSCT events will be documented on AF Form 1522, AFORMS Additional
     Training Accomplishment input, or equivalent, and maintained as a record of class attendance IAW
     AFI 37-139. Only those event identifiers shown in Table 5.1. of this instruction will be used to iden-
     tify ALSCT events.
     5.8.2. Upon completion of training, one or more rosters will be signed by the instructor and for-
     warded to appropriate office for input into AFORMS. The OSS ALS staff will keep a duplicate copy
     of the rosters on file.
     5.8.3. Instructors will provide written documentation to individuals who are from another unit (i.e.,
     Inspector General, HHQs staff, and visiting aircrews) so their records can be updated at home station.
     5.8.4. FTU and Basic Fighter Training (BFT) student rosters will be maintained until graduation.
     5.8.5. ALS is not responsible for maintaining AFORMS or managing and tracking aircrew training
     status for ALSCT events in AFORMS.

5.9. Training Aids and Equipment:
5.9. (439AW) Training Aids and Equipment:
     5.9.1. Emergency ground and air egress and ejection seat training will be accomplished using the
     appropriate Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) or the aircraft. Non-ejection seat egress training will be
     conducted using actual aircraft to the maximum extent possible.
     5.9.2. Units may use the actual aircraft installed ejection seat for egress training when designated
     training devices are not available provided all ejection seats are made safe by qualified egress person-
     nel.
     5.9.3. For ACDT and egress training, aircrew members are required to wear all clothing and ALSE
     items typically worn during contingency operations unless specifically prohibited by this instruction.
     5.9.4. ALSCTIs will inspect training devices and aids prior to use to ensure they are properly config-
     ured and operational for training. The LSS or their designated representative will perform semi-annual
     inspections of all training devices and aids to ensure they are current and safe for training use. This
AFI11-301V1_439AWSUP_I 29 NOVEMBER 2002                                                               35


   includes displays, EPTs, PDT devices, ACDE, ALSE, personnel lowering devices, and water survival
   equipment. Inspections will be documented appropriately.
   5.9.5. Training equipment, to include PDT and EPT devices, will mirror operational equipment to the
   maximum extent possible. Equipment used for training will be clearly marked "FOR TRAINING
   USE ONLY" and stored to prevent co-mingling with operational equipment. When training equip-
   ment does not exist (i.e., night vision devices, PRC-112 series radios, etc.), MAJCOMs may designate
   the use of operational equipment for training as long as the training does not damage or destroy the
   integrity of the equipment.
   5.9.6. (Added-439AW) Life Support personnel who are ALSCTI are authorized to wear flight cloth-
   ing IAW AS 016 while performing SS02 and SS05 only.

5.10. Instructor Guides and Lesson Plans:
   5.10.1. ALSCT Instructor Guides (IG). IGs are documents developed to prescribe instructional
   requirements, teaching points, and instructor-student activities essential to the accomplishment of
   training objectives. IGs are designed to include the minimum training requirements and are essential
   for supervisors and instructors to ensure lesson objectives are completed.
   5.10.2. Only approved IGs developed by the MAJCOMs and the 436th Training Squadron Aircrew
   Life Support Section, Dyess AFB, Texas will be used to conduct ALSCT. The IGs developed by the
   436 TS are complete and ready to use by the units once they have been approved by the lead MDS
   MAJCOM. Units should delete information from the IGs that do not pertain to their mission. MAJ-
   COMs will use, to the maximum extent possible, IGs developed by the 436 TS. IGs not developed by
   the 436 TS will be developed by the MAJCOM. MAJCOMs can request the 436 TS to develop an IG;
   if approved, the MAJCOM will provide necessary funding. Approved IGs are available at:
   https://wwwmil.dyess.af.mil/436ts/lifesupport.htm.
   5.10.3. ALSCT LP. Lesson plans are documents developed and prepared for use by instructors to
   organize and present information. This is accomplished by writing a separate document with personal
   instructional notes and material. The lesson plan must be validated with approved reference materials
   that can be produced upon request.
   5.10.4. The group LSO or LSS must produce standardized lesson plans for use by all ALSCTIs if no
   IG is available. Units will forward a copy of each lesson plan used to their MAJCOM for review and
   approval prior to publication and use.
   5.10.5. All IGs and locally prepared lesson plans used in the conduct of ALSCT will be reviewed
   annually by the group LSO or LSS. Annual reviews will be documented appropriately.
   5.10.6. Higher headquarters correspondence (e.g., messages, flight crew information files [FCIF],
   etc.) directing the inclusion of information not covered in ALSCT IGs or lesson plans will be added as
   directed.

38                                                  AFI11-301V1_439AWSUP_I 29 NOVEMBER 2002


     6.3.1. Responsibility of the Aircrew Member. Aircrew members have the same responsibility for
     their survival knives that security police have for their side arms. Aircrew members are subject to mil-
     itary and civil penal action if they unsheathe the MC-1 knife outside of a survival or training situation.
     6.3.2. Action in Case of Civil Apprehension. If a civil officer arrests an aircrew member who is wear-
     ing the survival knife as part of the flight uniform, the aircrew member will take the following action:
        6.3.2.1. Do not resist apprehension. Comply with the civil officer’s instructions.
        6.3.2.2. Explain to the civil officer that the knife is part of their authorized flight uniform.
        6.3.2.3. Notify the nearest Chief of United States Military Security Forces, who in-turn contacts
        the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) of the nearest military installation. The SJA, in turn, reports the
        incident to HQ USAF.

6.4. ALSE Requirements. Only ALSE approved as safe-to-fly will be issued, worn, installed or used for
flight operations. All ALSE will be sized, fitted, issued, inspected, maintained, modified, controlled and
stored IAW applicable Technical Order (T.O.) guidance, approved commercial manuals, and applicable
MAJCOM directives. The following specific guidance applies:
     6.4.1. Aircrew helmets will be used as required and inspected and maintained IAW applicable
     14P-series T.O.s.
        6.4.1.1. All aircrew helmets will be subdued factory gray or blended to match the aircraft color
        scheme so as not to contrast or brightly reflect off inside of the canopy or cockpit glass. Subduing
        can be accomplished by application of paint or taping of helmet shells to blend with the aircraft
        exterior color. Subdued method is at the discretion of the unit commander. BFT, FTU students, and
        units without a mobility commitment are exempt from this requirement.
        6.4.1.2. Foreign students may use their own helmets if systems are compatible. However, contin-
        ued use will depend on availability of maintenance procedures and replacement parts.
        6.4.1.3. Only helmet visor housings and visor fabric covers may be customized with unit
        approved designs. Visor housings may only be customized using elastomeric film (decals), tape or
        equivalent materials. Designs must not interfere with visor operations, the EEU-series goggle top
        latch assembly, or the night vision goggle (NVG) mounting bracket. Designs will be obliterated by
        removing decals, painting over designs, or replacing visor housings or covers when necessary to
        comply with real world sanitization requirements.
     6.4.2. Helmets mounted devices (Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System [JHMCS], NVGs, Nuclear
     Flashblindness Goggles, Laser Eye Protection & High Contrast Visors) will only be worn or used by
     aircrew members requiring them to perform specific missions. Inspection and maintenance of these
     devices will be accomplished IAW appropriate T.O.s and MAJCOM guidance.
        6.4.2.1. ALS technicians will perform operational and intermediate level maintenance on aviators
        NVGs. Additionally, ALS personnel are responsible for issuing, fitting, inspection, maintenance,
        and storage of aviators NVGs only.
        6.4.2.2. Where applicable, squadron commanders will ensure an area is designated for use by air-
        crew members to perform NVG preflight operations.
        6.4.2.3. Inspect thermal flash blindness devices.

  6.4.3. Global Positioning System Receivers. Inspect and configure IAW appropriate T.O.s and MAJ-
  COM, Special Instruction (SPIN) notices, and theater guidance.
  6.4.4. Anti-G Garments are required during all flights in aircraft equipped with anti-G systems when
  2 or more “Gs” are anticipated.
     6.4.4.1. CSU-Series Anti-G Garment. Aircrews who are required to wear anti-exposure suits as
     well as aircrew chemical defense ensembles will have a second anti-G garment fitted for use with
     these items. This does not apply to the CSU-17/P anti-G vest.
     6.4.4.2. Combined Advanced Technology Enhanced Designed “G” Ensemble (COMBAT
     EDGE). The wear of COMBAT EDGE is required on all flights where 6 Gs or more is pre-planned
     or anticipated and assigned aircraft are appropriately modified to accommodate COMBAT EDGE
     equipment. The CRU-94/P oxygen connector will be used in all equipment configurations with the
     exception of real world chemical flights that require the use of the ACDE or AERP.
  6.4.5. Anti-Exposure Suits. Only authorized and approved anti-exposure suits will be worn by air-
  crews and passengers.
     6.4.5.1. Non-Ejection Seat Aircraft. Quick-don anti-exposure suits will be readily available for
     aircrew during overwater flights when the water temperature is 60 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (15.5
     Celsius (C) or less.

Terms
Aircrew Contamination Control Area (ACCA)—A self-sustaining aircrew only decontamination
control area that minimizes cross contamination to aircrew and is staffed by certified ALS personnel.
Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE) Equipment—Individually fitted aircrew unique
chemical protective equipment for the sole purpose of protecting operators from chemical/biological
warfare agents who fly into and out of a chemically contaminated environment.
Aeromedical Evacuation (AE)—The movement of patients under medical supervision to and between
medical treatment facilities by air transportation. (Joint Pub 1-02)
Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Members (AECM)—Qualified flight nurses (FN), aeromedical
evacuation technicians (AET), and unqualified student trainees under the direct supervision of a qualified
instructor or FN, performing AE duties.
Aircrew Life Support Equipment (ALSE)—ALSE encompasses all equipment that is part of the 412A
life support system or as designated by ANG/DOOS.

Aircrew Eye/Respiratory Protection (AERP) Equipment—AERP equipment is designed to protect
the crewmember from toxic chemical exposure to the head, neck, face, eyes, and respiratory tract. This
equipment is designed to provide protection without imposing operational or physiological burdens,
degrading mission capability, or combat effectiveness.
Area of Operations (AO) (DOD)—An operational area defined by the joint force commander for land
and naval forces. Areas of operation do not typically encompass the entire operational area of the joint
force commander, but should be large enough for component commanders to accomplish their missions
and protect their forces. Also called AO. See also area of responsibility; joint operations area; joint special
operations area.
Arctic Flight—Any flight conducted above the 50th parallel of north latitude.
Antarctic Flight—Any flight conducted below the 56th parallel of south latitude.
Bare Base—A base having minimum essential facilities to house, sustain, and support operations to
include, if required, a stabilized runway, taxiways, and aircraft parking areas. A bare base must have a
source of water that can be made potable. Other requirements to operate under bare base conditions form
a necessary part of the force package deployed to the bare base.
Chemical Threat Area (CTA)—An area that may be subject to attack with chemical warfare agents
from a number of sources.
D-1 Bag—One complete Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble carried by aircrews when deploying to
chemical threat environment.
D-Bags—Full compliment of ACDE equipment. May or may not include the D-1 bag during deployment.
Desolate Terrain Flight—Any flight conducted over uninhabited areas (excluding the Continental
United States [CONUS]) exceeding one hour flight time.
Ground Crew Contamination Control Area (CCA)—Area managed by civil engineering readiness
flight to safely process ground crew personnel
Logistics Detail (LOGDET)—The LOGDET defines standard passenger and equipment movement
requirements for each UTC. Equipment detail is provided at the NSN level. Lists all material in an UTC,
prioritizes increment movement, provides increment characteristics, and is the standard equipment listing
for planning.
Nomex®—Nomex® fabric is a high-temperature resistant and inherently flame retardant synthetic fabric
with no-hot-melt point or drip characteristics. The fabric is light in weight, will not support combustion,
but will begin to char at 700° to 800° F. The fabric has good abrasion resistance similar to nylon and is
also nonabsorbent like nylon and other synthetic fabrics.
Operational Support Crewmember—Personnel on flying status but not occupying a UMD "A" prefix
position.
Operation Plan (OPLAN) (DOD)—Any plan, except for the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP),
for the conduct of military operations. Plans are prepared by combatant commanders in response to
requirements established by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and by commanders of subordinate
commands in response to requirements tasked by the establishing unified commander. An OPLAN
identifies the forces and supplies required to execute the CINC's Strategic Concept and a movement
schedule of these resources to the theater of operations. The forces and supplies are identified in
AFI11-301V1_439AWSUP_I 29 NOVEMBER 2002                                                            61


time-phased force deployment data (TPFDD) files. OPLANs will include all phases of the tasked
operation. The plan is prepared with the appropriate annexes, appendixes, and TPFDD files as described
in the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System manuals containing planning policies, procedures,
and formats. OPLANs are prepared in either a complete format (OPLAN) or as a concept plan
(CONPLAN). The CONPLAN can be published with or without a TPFDD file. An OPLAN for the
conduct of joint operations that can be used as a basis for development of an operation order (OPORD).
Overwater Flight—Any flight taking off or landing over water, exceeding power-off glide or
auto-rotational distance from land.
Passenger (PAX)—Individual aboard aircraft for the purpose of transportation.
Pilot Unit—Unit designated by the MAJCOM FM to handle LOGDET management responsibilities for
an UTC. Pilot units are listed in the header record of each UTC and LOGDET.
Primary Aircraft Inventory (DOD)—The aircraft assigned to meet the primary aircraft authorization.
Also called PAI.
Primary Crewmember—Any person, rated or nonrated, and required on aircraft to accomplish flying
mission.
Theater (DOD)—The geographical area outside the continental United States for which a commander of
a combatant command has been assigned responsibility.
Unit Manpower Document (UMD)—A detailed staffing list reflecting the distribution of staffing
allocations into a finite structure of authorizations (by work center).
Unit Type Code (UTC)—A five-character, alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies each type unit of
the Armed Forces.
