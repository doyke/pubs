                                                 Chapter 1

                                      GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose of Investigations and Reports.
    1.1.1. This manual, in conjunction with AFI 91-204, provides guidance for categorizing, classifying,
    investigating and reporting AF ground mishaps. Ground mishaps, in general are primarily categorized
    by the environment and duty status in which they occur. Report any unplanned occurrence, injury, or
    property damage, defined in AFI 91-204, Chapter 1, and Figure 1.1. (afloat, motor vehicle, off-duty
    military, ground and industrial) and this manual as ground mishaps.

1.2. Accounting for Losses. In addition to the guidance provided in AFI 91-204, Chapter 1 and Chap-
ter 4, the following should be used.
    1.2.1. Record a military or civilian injury/loss to the command the individual is assigned to at the
    time of a mishap. Use military personnel data records and civilian payroll records to make determina-
    tions. Air Reserve Component (ARC) personnel who are activated under 10 U.S.C. 12301 or 12302
    are accounted to their parent unit.
    1.2.2. Record a mishap occurring to an individual in any permanent change of station (PCS) status to
    the losing command until the individual signs in at the new duty station. The “transfer effective date”
    is not criteria for determining the unit of assignment.
    1.2.3. Record a mishap involving an individual being transferred PCS with temporary duty pending
    further orders to the organization originating the initial orders until the individual signs in at the next
    permanent duty station.
    1.2.4. Record mishaps involving foreign exchange students and military members in non-pay status
    while awaiting an appellate review (appellate leave) or court martial to the Air Force at Large. For
    mishap reporting purposes, personnel in a non-pay status are returned to active duty when notified
    (written or verbal) to return to an Air Force installation.
    1.2.5. When a unit makes an Air Force Government Motor Vehicle (GMV) or Government Vehicle,
    Other (GVO) available to another unit on a recurring or permanent dispatch, the using organization is
    the owning command. NOTE: Vehicles on receipt to, and operated by, non-DoD persons or agencies
    and activities such as the U.S. Postal Service or the American Red Cross are not GMVs.

1.3. Determining Duty Status. Ground mishaps may occur in many different environments and duty
status which are used as part of the determination for categorizing ground mishaps. The definitions in AFI
91-204 are for mishap reporting purposes only and are not related to compensation or a line-of-duty deter-
mination.

1.4. Mishap and Event Classification. Class E (High Accident Potential (HAPs)) are the only events
reported for ground safety.

1.5. Determining Injury Severity and Mishap Costs to Non-DoD Personnel and Property..
    1.5.1. Determine injury severity in accordance with AFI 91-204. Air Force operations can contribute
    to or cause on-duty mishaps when Air Force personnel are not present. This determination is based on
AFMAN91-224_ACCSUP_I 4 MARCH 2005                                                                        5


  whether an Air Force action or inaction is totally or partially responsible for a non-Air Force injury or
  property damage. The loss of non-Air Force property in an Air Force-owned house fire caused by
  faulty electrical wiring is an example of an Air Force operation that causes or results in damage to
  non-Air Force property (resident’s personal property). An example of the Air Force causing or con-
  tributing to injuries to non-AF personnel could occur when an Air Force member allows non-Air
  Force personnel to visit an industrial work area containing powered equipment, the visitor is left
  alone, and injures him or herself on an unguarded piece of equipment.
  1.5.2. When determining injury severity or disability (i.e., fatality, permanent total disability, perma-
  nent partial disability, lost time case, or no lost time case), for non-DoD personnel the investigator’s
  best judgment may be used if accurate information from civilian medical authorities is not available.
  Lost time for injured children and unemployed adults must be determined by assessing the degree of
  injury and an estimate of when the individual may have been able to return to normal activities.

   installation nearest the mishap will complete the following actions for ground mishaps.
      4.1.1.1. Host and tenant commanders determine investigative responsibility for tenant ground
      mishaps. In instances where the convening authority is not the asset-owning commander, provide
      a courtesy report to the asset-owning commander. NOTE: Tenant units with qualified full time
      safety personnel will investigate and report that unit’s (tenant) internal mishaps.
      4.1.1.2. Fire investigators/personnel will investigate all fire losses to real property, wild land fires,
      and personal property (excluding military aircraft flight-related operations) to determine point of
      origin and cause of the fire in conjunction with the safety investigation but before initiating a legal
      investigation. Point of origin and fire cause determination shall be provided to the safety investi-
      gation board/investigating officer.

                                      SAFETY INVESTIGATIONS

5.1. General Information. Follow guidance in AFI 91-204, Chapter 5 as well as this manual when con-
ducting investigations to determine reportability and the cause of ground mishaps.
     5.1.1. A SIB or tailored SIB is required for Class A on-duty ground mishaps. The SIB is the primary
     vehicle for conducting a safety investigation for the purposes of mishap prevention. See paragraph
     5.3. below for specific membership requirements and responsibilities. SIBs may be tailored as appro-
     priate by the convening authority. The convening authority may request a waiver to these require-
     ments by contacting AFSC/SEG. Refer to AFI 91-204, paragraph 5.4. for additional guidance.

5.2. Investigation Timeline.
     5.2.1. The guidance in AFI 91-204, paragraph 5.2. and this manual applies.
        5.2.1.1. All timelines start on the day of the mishap. If the investigation cannot be completed
        within the timeframe allotted, requests for an extension should be submitted via AFSAS from the
        SIB, tailored SIB, or SIO to the convening authority for coordination and, if endorsed, to AFSC/
        SEG for approval. Note: For mishaps where the MAJCOM/CC is not the convening authority,
        MAJCOM/SEG coordination is required prior to forwarding to AFSC/SEG.
        5.2.1.2. Convening authority briefing, when conducted, should be scheduled as soon as possible
        after completion of the investigation. Refer to AFI 91-204, Table 6.2. for additional guidance.
        5.2.1.3. The convening authority for any category or classification of ground mishap/event may
        send out any kind of immediate need messages such as one-time inspections, groundings, time
        compliance technical orders (TCTOs), etc., if these are needed before the investigation and report
        are finalized.

5.3. Ground Safety Investigation Board Composition and Qualifications. For all on-duty Class A
and complex on-duty Class B ground mishaps the convening authority normally convenes a full SIB.
Convening authority may convene a tailored SIB by designating a specific SIB composition.
     5.3.1. Primary SIB Members. "Primary" SIB members determine findings, causes, recommendations,
     and are authorized to submit a minority report if they do not agree with the Board President (BP) in
     the outcome of the investigation. Minority reports must include reasons for disagreeing and will
     include suggested findings, causes, and recommendations if different from those included in the
     report.
        5.3.1.1. For on-duty Class A mishaps, the Board President:
            5.3.1.1.1. Will be a Colonel or GS-15.
            5.3.1.1.2. Be from outside the mishap wing.

            Member should be a graduate of the MINA, AMIC, or the JEMIC course(s). NOTE: A task
            certified 5-skill level (ISOX1) may be selected to investigate Class C and D mishaps and Class
            E events.
            5.3.3.2.2. A SIO normally investigates Class C and D ground mishaps and Class E events.

5.4. Deficiency Reporting Procedures.
     5.4.1. If a SIO or SIB suspects that a component may be deficient, submit a deficiency report (DR)
     IAW T.O. 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting and Investigating System. Do not attempt field dis-
     assembly of the exhibit.
     5.4.2. Category I DRs are normally submitted for Class A mishaps and Category II DRs are normally
     submitted for Class B and C mishaps. See TO 00-35D-54 for more information. Consider initiating a
     Category I DR for Class B or C mishaps and Class E events items, if a potential exists for the item to
     cause a future Class A mishap. Verbally request priority teardown of suspect components by coordi-
     nating with the single manager (SM).
     5.4.3. If assistance is required to determine where to send a DR exhibit, contact HQ AFSC/SEG. In
     most cases, teardown and analysis will be conducted by a DoD facility. Do not directly contact con-
     tractors or vendors for teardown and analysis without first coordinating with the SM or HQ AFSC/
     SEG.
     5.4.4. Handle and ship exhibits according to T.O. 00-35D-54. Use T.O. 2J-1-18, Engine Shipping
     Instructions, which explains how to mark engines for teardown. Ensure the mishap event number is
     referenced in the I 90 field of the Deficiency Report. Enter the Deficiency Report Control Number
     into the mishap narrative in AFSAS. Include exhibit disposition instructions in all DRs (e.g., return
     exhibit to originator, convening MAJCOM, etc.). Do not dispose of exhibits sent from Class A mis-
     haps or mishaps involving potential litigation until authorized by the Air Force Legal Service Agency
     (AFLSA/JACT). Store these exhibits at either the facility that performed the analysis, or return the
     exhibit to the SIB or the host installation commander, as appropriate. Take follow-up actions to ensure
     exhibits were received and teardowns are progressing in a timely manner.
     5.4.5. Place a copy of all teardown reports, including all supporting documents (e.g. metallurgical
     analyses, photographs, test reports, etc...), provided in response to DRs in the formal report.
AFMAN91-224_ACCSUP_I 4 MARCH 2005                                                                       13


   5.4.6. The convening authority safety office takes follow-up action if the final safety report was sent
   before receipt of all DR responses are received. If final exhibit disposition instructions were not
   included in the original DR, the convening authority safety office will provide them to the SM.

5.5. Ground Mishap Investigative Process.
   5.5.1. Once appointed, the SIB or SIO will relieve the interim safety board (ISB) or On-Scene Com-
   mander (OSC) as soon as possible, take control of the investigation and accept custody of all
   impounded evidence, lists of potential witnesses, etc..
   5.5.2. The SIB or SIO should provide timely, factual information to the convening authority for incre-
   mental release to the public through the Public Affairs office or designated official.
   5.5.3. For investigations that involve fire (AFI 91-204, Chapter 1), ensure fire personnel are
   engaged, either as a SIB member or as a technical advisor to the SIO, to determine the point of origin
   and cause of the fire.
   5.5.4. The SIB or SIO must maintain a good working relationship with the legal investigator(s) (com-
   mander directed, OSI, Security Police, etc.) to facilitate a thorough safety investigation. If possible,
   the BP or SIO should formally meet with legal investigator(s) at the beginning of the investigation to
   establish a good working relationship. As a minimum, the BP or SIO should:
      5.5.4.1. Review the responsibilities of the Safety and Legal investigator(s).
      5.5.4.2. Review privileged information criteria but do not discuss privileged information with the
      legal investigator(s).
      5.5.4.3. Determine a debris recovery strategy.
      5.5.4.4. Review the process for planning, coordinating, approving, and executing tests that may
      alter or destroy evidence.
      5.5.4.5. Review the processes for control of information in order to:
          5.5.4.5.1. Protect information from unauthorized release and release appropriate information
          as soon as feasible.
          5.5.4.5.2. Maintain separation of factual and privileged information.
   5.5.5. Control information access to those with approved access and a valid need to know.
   5.5.6. Release impounded information and evidence when no longer needed for investigation pur-
   poses.
   5.5.7. The process ends with the completion of a final message report and, for on-duty Class A and B
   mishaps, a formal report (unless HQ AFSC grants a waiver). Once accepted by the convening author-
   ity, HQ AFSC reviews the report, issues a Memorandum of Final Evaluation for on-duty Class A and
   B reports, and tracks open recommendations until closure.
   5.5.8. During the investigation, do not assign SIB members or a SIO duties unrelated to the mishap
   investigation.

                                                 Chapter 6

                                      REPORTS AND BRIEFINGS

6.1. General Information. Prepare and submit ground mishaps in accordance with AFI 91-204, Chap-
ter 6, the Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS), and this manual.
     6.1.1. Class C off-duty mishaps do not require a preliminary report.
     6.1.2. Report Class D mishaps within 6 days of notification (refer to section 6.6. of this AFMAN).

6.2. Preparing Message Reports.
     6.2.1. Unless otherwise noted, AFSAS is the primary means of documenting and transmitting all
     ground Class A, B, C, D reports and Class E event messages. In the event AFSAS is unavailable, mis-
     hap reporting may be delayed until it is available. However, if the mishap is Class A or B on-duty or
     Class A off-duty, immediate telephonic notification will be made to the owning MAJCOM, DRU,
     FOA safety office who will in-turn notify HQ AFSC/SEG.
        6.2.1.1. (Added-ACC) For consistency, ground mishaps will be consecutively numbered with a
        Unit Control Number (UCN) starting with 001 for each mishap classification (e.g., 001A, 002A,
        001C, 002C). Mishap numbers restart at the beginning of each fiscal year. Ensure the UCN is
        added to paragraph 1.8. of all SAS mishap reports.
     6.2.2. Addressees listed in Table 6.1. will be used for distribution and are based on the organization’s
     need to know. Use of the table will help to prevent inadvertent release of privileged safety information
     outside the Air Force. Currently HQ AFSC/SEG and MAJCOM addresses are included in AFSAS
     message by default and do not have to be selected however; units must select additional addresses
     based on the requirements of Table 6.1.
     6.2.3. Ensure all Department of the Air Force agencies identified as Office of Primary Responsibility
     (OPR) for mishap recommendations are included in the addressee list. For OPRs outside the Air
     Force, the convening authority should consult with HQ AFSC/JA on the appropriate means of con-
     veying the tasking.

6.3. Reviewing the Final Message Report. Upon completion of the investigation, the SIB or SIO for-
wards the final message report to the convening authority for approval and release.
     6.3.1. (Added-ACC) The appropriate wing/unit as applicable, should have all ground mishaps
     reviewed by their NAF/DRU prior to release or being forwarded to ACC/SEG.

6.4. Determining the Mishap Event Number.
     6.4.1. A single Mishap Event Number is automatically assigned by AFSAS, which tracks each mis-
     hap when information is initially entered into AFSAS.
     6.4.2. Because the mishap event number is the single common worldwide identifier for a mishap,
     include this number on all correspondence relating to a specific mishap (endorsements, classification
     changes, etc.).
AFMAN91-224_ACCSUP_I 4 MARCH 2005                                                                      15


   6.4.3. The Mishap Event Number consists of the base code (XXXX), the year the mishap occurred
   (2003), date of the mishap (0926), a series of AFSAS assigned numbers, and the alpha classification
   (A, B, C, D, or E) of the event being reported.
   6.4.4. An optional Unit Control Number (UCN) is available for additional unit tracking and should
   follow the format defined by the MAJCOM.

6.5. Formal Reports.
   6.5.1. Follow the guidance in AFI 91-204, Chapter 6 and this chapter, to prepare and distribute
   ground formal reports.
   6.5.2. Formal Report Waivers.
      6.5.2.1. On-duty Class A/B mishaps require a formal report unless waived by HQ AFSC/SEG.
      See AFI 91-204 for guidance on formal report waivers.
      6.5.2.2. HQ AFSC/SEG will normally only consider waivers for mishaps involving known mate-
      riel deficiencies for which corrective actions have been established.
      6.5.2.3. Waivers will not normally be granted for mishaps involving personnel factors (such as
      human performance failures or inadequate supervision).
      6.5.2.4. Waivers for formal reporting are processed through AFSAS. Waiver requests validated
      by MAJCOM/DRU/FOA Chief of Safety or designated authority will be forwarded to AFSC/SEG
      for approval/disapproval of the request.
      6.5.2.5. HQ AFSC/SEG evaluates each waiver request on a case-by-case basis, considering all
      completed message reports, supporting material and other factors. When requesting a waiver, the
      request must be accompanied by an updated STATUS Report entered into AFSAS that includes all
      available information with sufficient detail in the narrative that clearly shows the mishap sequence
      of events, causal findings, and proposed recommendations.
   6.5.3. What to Include in Formal Reports.
      6.5.3.1. Formal report composition and format are detailed in Attachment 2 of this manual.
      6.5.3.2. Ground safety investigators will use tabs as necessary based on the category, complexity,
      and other factors involved in the mishap.
      6.5.3.3. Formal reports for on-duty Class A and Class B will include as a minimum, but are not
      limited to, the following tabs. (NOTE: Additional information may be inserted as necessary based
      on the investigation.)
          6.5.3.3.1. A completed AF IMT 711A, USAF Mishap Report Checklist and Index, filed in the
          front of the formal report.

        make non-substantive changes to the reports in order to improve the quality of the reports.
     6.5.4. Distributing the Formal Report
        6.5.4.1. Distribution of formal privileged reports is restricted to AF personnel with a need to
        know for mishap prevention purposes. See AFI 91-204 for information on access to safety reports.
        See Table 6.2. of this AFMAN for formal report distribution requirements.
        6.5.4.2. HQ AFSC or MAJCOM safety offices may require additional copies to be sent to their
        headquarters to aid in staffing the report, but must destroy all reports after completion.
     6.5.5. Forwarding Formal Reports. If an Air Staff office is the action agency for a validated recom-
     mendation, the MAJCOM safety office will forward a copy of the report to AF/SEI for transmittal to
     the Air Staff office. MAJCOM safety offices forward reports directly to FOAs or DRUs.
        6.5.5.1. (Added-ACC) For Class A or B on-duty ground mishap formal reports, NAF (SIBs) will
        make the following distribution: original to HQ AFSC/SE and one copy to HQ ACC/SEG and
        other appropriate addressees.
            6.5.5.1.1. (Added-ACC) In SAS reports, ACC units will use the following release authorities
            for ground mishaps: All Class A mishaps will be reviewed by the wing commander, then for-
            warded to the NAF/SE for review. ACC/SE will then approve and release the mishap report
            for COMACC. All Class B mishaps will be reviewed by the wing commander then forwarded
            to the NAF/SE for NAF/CC or designated representative approval and release. Class C Mis-
            haps: the wing commander or designee will review the report, and then the wing Safety Office
            will release the mishap report.

6.6. General Guidance Related to Recording Occupational Injuries and Illnesses.
     6.6.1. Executive Order 12196, Occupational Safety and Health Program for Federal Employees,
     requires federal agencies to report occupational mishaps to the Secretary of Labor. Title 29 CFR 1960,
     Basic Program Elements for Federal Employee Occupational Safety and Health Programs and
     Related Matters and Title 29 CFR 1904, Recording and Reporting Occupational Injuries and Illness,
     sets requirements and provides standard forms for documenting occupational illnesses and injuries.
     6.6.2. The host ground safety staff is the official Air Force office of record for maintaining occupa-
     tional illness and injury data and maintains consolidated records of injuries and illness meeting
AFMAN91-224_ACCSUP_I 4 MARCH 2005                                                                      17


   ground mishap Class A, B, C and D criteria. Mishaps involving injury and illnesses to on- and
   off-duty Air Force military and on-duty civilian personnel are recorded separately.
      6.6.2.1. (Added-ACC) ACC 740 Report, RCS: ACC-SEG (M) 0501. The reports will be com-

                                       FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS

7.1. Guidelines. Perform follow-up actions per AFI 91-204, Chapter 7 and this manual.

7.2. Review Process.
     7.2.1. When on-duty Class A and B mishap recommendations require action by agencies external to
     the convening authority, these agencies must review and comment on the report within 30 days of the
     message report release date.
        7.2.1.1. Action agency comments should provide the information needed to monitor corrective
        actions, such as a project number or engineering change proposal (ECP) number. When recom-
        mendations concern proposed equipment modifications the AF Program Executive Office
        (AFPEO), AFMC action agencies, or System Program Office (SPO) must state whether or not
        proposed modifications require a new development effort significantly beyond the scope of cur-
        rent responsibility.

7.3. Memorandum of Final Evaluation (MOFE).
     7.3.1. HQ USAF/SE has delegated HQ AFSC/SEG the approval authority for ground memorandum
     of final evaluations (MOFEs).
     7.3.2. HQ AFSC/SEG prepares a MOFE on each on-duty Class A and B formal ground mishap
     report.
     7.3.3. HQ AFSC will consolidate the results of follow-up actions in the supplemental information
     section of the HQ AFSC file copy of each formal report. This section should include:
        7.3.3.1. Comments on the final message report.
        7.3.3.2. Memorandum of Final Evaluation.
        7.3.3.3. Investigation reports from other organizations.
        7.3.3.4. Significant additional information received after the Final Message.
        7.3.3.5. Management of recommendations, with or without a MOFE.

7.4. Managing Recommendations Validated Through the MOFE.
     7.4.1. Responses for closing actions on open recommendations on mishap reports must be submitted
     to HQ AFSC/SEG. Ensure corrective actions taken on recommendations are accurate and contain spe-
     cific details that clearly state what was accomplished to close the recommendation(s).

Terms
AFLOAT MISHAP—An Air Force mishap occurring on board, or as the result of, a DOD vessel. This
also includes DOD diving or swimmer operations. This term includes mishaps occurring while loading
and/or off-loading or receiving services at dockside and mishaps occurring up to the high water mark
during amphibious or inshore warfare training operations. It applies also to all injuries to DOD personnel
occurring on board, whether or not job-related. Fatalities and/or injuries occurring on board that result
from shipyard, repair facility, or private contractor operations are not afloat mishaps.
AIR FORCE AT LARGE—Used for recording losses. Mishaps involving exchange students, military
members in a non-pay status while waiting for appellate review if they have no written or verbal orders to
return to an Air Force installation, prior service personnel on leave before reporting to initial permanent
duty assignment, etc., are recorded to the Air Force at large. Also used for recording losses of
non-accepted Air Force aerospace vehicles (AFI 91-204, paragraph 4.9.2.) and aerospace vehicles leased
to a non-DOD organization for modification, maintenance, repair, test, contract training, or experimental
project for a DOD component, when the Government has assumed ground and flight risk (AFI 91-204,
paragraph 4.9.3.).
AIR RESERVE COMPONENTS (ARC)—All units, organizations, and members of the ANG and
AFRC (10 U.S.C. 261) on active duty, on active duty for training, or in drill status, and ANG and AFRC
technicians; include ANG and AFRC property and equipment. Military status starts upon beginning duty
for military pay and ends when duty stops. All references to Air Force military personnel and property
also apply to ARC military personnel and property.
CAUSAL FINDING—Causal findings are those, which, singly or in combination with other causal
findings, logically result in damage or injury. They are identified with the word "CAUSE" at the start of
the text of the finding.
CAUSE—A cause is a deficiency, which if corrected, eliminated, or avoided, would likely have
prevented or mitigated the mishap damage or significant injury.
CONVENING AUTHORITY—The individual who has the authority to order a safety investigation.
AFMAN91-224_ACCSUP_I 4 MARCH 2005                                                                       33


DISABILITY—See permanent partial disability or permanent total disability.
EVENT—An unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that does not meet the reporting criteria of
a mishap.
FATAL INJURY (Class A)—Injuries resulting in death, either in the mishap or at a later time, to include
within 30 days subsequent to being medically discharged, retired, or separated from the service, due to
complications arising from mishap injuries.
FINDINGS—Findings are the conclusions of the safety investigator. They are statements, in
chronological order, of each significant event or condition sustaining the sequence leading to the mishap.
FIRST AID CASE—Any initial one-time treatment and any follow-up visit for observation of minor
scratches, cuts, burns, and splinters, etc., that does not ordinarily require medical care. Such one-time
treatment and follow-up visit for observation is considered first aid, even though provided by a physician
or medical professional.
The following information describes those cases that would be considered first aid.
Treatment outside this finite list is considered medical treatment greater than first aid:
-- Using a non-prescription medication at nonprescription strength (for medications available in both pre-
scription and non-prescription form, a recommendation by a physician or other licensed health care pro-
fessional to use a non-prescription medication at prescription strength is considered medical treatment);
-- Administering tetanus immunizations (other immunizations, such as Hepatitis B vaccine or rabies vac-
cine, are considered medical treatment);
-- Cleaning, flushing or soaking wounds on the surface of the skin;
-- Using wound coverings such as bandages, Band-Aids™, gauze pads, etc.; or using butterfly bandages
or Steri-Strips™ (other wound closing devices such as sutures, staples, etc., are considered medical treat-
ment);
-- Using hot or cold therapy;
-- Using any non-rigid means of support, such as elastic bandages, wraps, non-rigid back belts, etc.
(devices with rigid stays or other systems designed to immobilize parts of the body are considered medi-
cal treatment);
-- Using temporary immobilization devices while transporting an accident victim (e.g., splints, slings,
neck collars, back boards, etc.).
-- Drilling of a fingernail or toenail to relieve pressure, or draining fluid from a blister;
-- Using eye patches;
-- Removing foreign bodies from the eye using only irrigation or a cotton swab;
-- Removing splinters or foreign material from areas other than the eye by irrigation, tweezers, cotton
swabs or other simple means;
-- Using finger guards;
-- Using massages (physical therapy or chiropractic treatment are considered medical treatment); or
-- Drinking fluids for relief of heat stress.

NOTE: See 29 CFR 1904, Recording and Reporting Occupational Injuries and Illness, for further guid-
ance for injury and illness classifications.
GOVERNMENT MOTOR VEHICLE (GMV)—A motor vehicle that is owned, leased, or rented by a
DOD Component (not individuals); primarily designed for over-the-road operations; and whose general
purpose is the transportation of cargo or personnel. Examples of GMVs are passenger cars, station
wagons, sport utility vehicles, vans, ambulances, buses, motorcycles, trucks, tractor-trailers, rental
vehicles authorized by official travel orders, and General Service Administration (GSA) vehicles.
Vehicles on receipt to, and operated by, non-DOD persons or agencies and activities such as the US Postal
Service or the American Red Cross are not GMVs. Includes Air Force owned motor vehicles not
identified as GVOs and General Services Administration (GSA) vehicles leased on a long- or short-term
basis.
GOVERNMENT VEHICLE OTHER (GVO)—Vehicles designed primarily for off-the-highway
operation such as construction tracked vehicles, forklifts, road graders, agricultural-type wheeled tractors,
and aircraft tugs. Includes military combat/tactical vehicles; e.g., tanks, self-propelled weapons, armored
personnel carriers, amphibious vehicles ashore, HMMWV, and off-highway motorcycles.
GROUND AND INDUSTRIAL MISHAP—An Air Force mishap that does not meet the mishap
category definition of nuclear, space, aviation, guided missile, explosives and chemical agents, directed
energy, afloat, motor vehicle, or off-duty military as defined by this instruction.
HAZARD—Any real or potential condition that can cause injury or occupational illness to personnel;
damage to or loss of a system, equipment or property; or damage to the environment.
HIGH ACCIDENT POTENTIAL (HAP) EVENT—Any hazardous occurrence that has a high
potential for becoming a mishap that does not fit the definition of a HATR.
INDUSTRIAL AVIATION MISHAP—Mishaps occurring in the industrial environment that: involve a
DOD aircraft or UAV when being handled as cargo; or involve DOD aircraft or UAV component not
attached to the fuselage/airframe. Additionally, use this subcategory as a cross category for aviation
mishaps where maintenance or operations in the industrial environment result in a reportable mishap.
INDUSTRIAL MISHAP—A ground and industrial mishap that occurs in the work environment that
does not meet the mishap subcategory definition of fire, combat training, physical and athletic
conditioning, contractor, natural phenomena, industrial space, industrial aviation, or industrial weapons as
defined by this instruction. The work environment, as defined in 29 Code of Federal Regulations 1960, is
"The establishment and other locations where one or more Air Force employees are working or are
present as a condition of their employment; this would include those areas or locations where persons are
TDY for training purposes. The work environment includes not only physical locations, but also the
equipment or materiels used by the employee during the course of his or her work."
INDUSTRIAL SPACE MISHAP—Mishaps occurring in the industrial environment that involve space
systems (pre-launch) or unique space support equipment. As defined in paragraph 1.6.1.2., these mishaps
will always be classified as space mishaps. Use this subcategory for cross-categorization to ground and
industrial only.
INDUSTRIAL WEAPONS MISHAP—Mishaps occurring in the industrial environment that involve
weapons (i.e., nuclear, guided missile, explosives and chemical agents, or directed energy) or associated
unique support equipment. Examples include bomb fin damage during handling or injury to a worker
during a MJ-1 bomb lift operation.
AFMAN91-224_ACCSUP_I 4 MARCH 2005                                                                           35


INJURY—A traumatic wound or other condition of the body caused by external force or deprivation
(fractures, lacerations, sprains, dislocations, concussions, compressions, drowning, suffocation, exposure,
cold injury, and dehydration), including stress or strain, which results from an unplanned event. The
injury is identifiable as to the time and place of occurrence and member or function of the body affected,
and is caused by a specific event or incident or series of events or incidents in a single day or work shift.
LOST TIME CASE (Class C)—A nonfatal traumatic injury or occupational illness or disease that
causes loss of one or more days away from work beyond the day or shift it occurred. When determining if
the mishap is a Lost Time Case, you must count the number of days the employee was unable to work as
a result of the injury or illness, regardless of whether or not the person was scheduled to work on those
days. Weekend days, holidays, vacation days, or other days off are included in the total number of days, if
the employee would not have been able to work on those days because of a work-related injury or illness.
NOTE: While 29 CFR 1904.5(b)(2)(iii) and 1904.5(b)(2)(iv) exempts reporting of certain occurrences
that result from voluntary participation in wellness and fitness programs, or recreational activities such as
exercise class, racquetball, or baseball or injuries or illnesses resulting to an employee eating, drinking, or
preparing food for personnel consumption, the Air Force requires reporting of these occurrences.
MAJCOM—The term "MAJCOM " as used in this instruction includes ANG, DRUs, and FOAs unless
otherwise specified.
MISHAP—A mishap is an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in damage or
injury and meets Class A, B, C, or D mishap reporting criteria IAW AFI 91-204, paragraph 1.8. Damage
or injury includes: damage to DOD property; occupational illness to DOD military or civilian personnel;
injury to DOD military personnel on- or off-duty; injury to on-duty DOD civilian personnel; damage to
public or private property, or injury or illness to non-DOD personnel caused by Air Force operations.
MISCELLANEOUS GROUND MISHAP—Mishaps that do not fit into any of the other subcategories
identified in this instruction.
MOTOR VEHICLE MISHAP—An Air Force mishap involving the operation of a motorized land
vehicle operated by Air Force personnel. An Air Force mishap involving the operation of a DOD-owned
or leased motorized land vehicle by non-Air Force personnel while operationally controlled by a DOD
component. Fatalities or injuries to pedestrians or bicyclists involving moving motor vehicles are
included in this category. This category does not include ground and industrial mishaps such as injuries
occurring while loading or unloading, mounting or dismounting a non-moving vehicle; cargo damaged by
weather; damage to a properly parked DOD vehicle, unless caused by an operating DOD vehicle.
Additionally, damage to an Air Force vehicle caused by objects thrown or propelled into it by weather or
natural phenomena, or by fire when no collision occurred; or damage to an Air Force vehicle when it is
being handled as cargo and not operating under its own power and is properly parked, are not categorized
as motor vehicle mishaps. Motor vehicle mishaps are divided into the following subcategories:
Government Motor Vehicle (GMV), Government Vehicle Other (GVO), and Private Motor Vehicle
(PMV).
NO LOST TIME CASE (Class D)—Any nonfatal injury or occupational illness that does not meet the
definition of Lost Time. These are cases where, because of injury or occupational illness, Air Force
personnel only works partial days, restricted work or were transferred to another job, required medical
treatment greater than first aid, lost of consciousness, or a significant injury or illness diagnosed by a
physician or other licensed health care professional, even if it does not result in death, days away from
work, restricted work or job transfer, medical treatment greater then first aid, or loss of consciousness.

NOTE: While 29 CFR 1904.5(b)(2)(iii) and 1904.5(b)(2)(iv) exempts reporting of certain occurrences
that result from voluntary participation in wellness and fitness programs, or recreational activities such as
exercise class, racquetball, or baseball or injuries or illnesses resulting to an employee eating, drinking, or
preparing food for personnel consumption, the Air Force requires reporting of these occurrences.
OBSERVATION AND/OR DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURE—Hospitalization or restriction from
assigned work activities for observation or diagnosis is not a "lost time case," "no lost time case," or "first
aid case" provided no treatment or medication is given for the suspected injury or occupational illness,
and competent medical authority determines the individual could have returned to his or her normal job
without impairment or disability. This classification applies also where an individual is temporarily
restricted from regularly assigned duties to prevent exceeding time-weighted exposure limits. This is not
reportable if a competent medical authority provides no treatment or medication for the suspected injury
or occupational illness or finds the person could have returned to normal assigned duties without
impairment or disability.
OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS—Any reported condition that does not meet the definition of injury. Any
abnormal physical condition or disorder, other than one resulting from an occupational injury, resulting in
adverse consequences and caused by occupational factors associated with employment. Includes all
confirmed cases of acute and chronic illnesses or diseases caused by inhalation, absorption, ingestion or
direct contact with suspect substances.
OFF-DUTY—DOD personnel are off-duty when they are not on-duty (see on-duty definition). Personnel
participating in base team sporting activities or in a permissive temporary duty (TDY) status are off-duty.
Reserve and National Guard personnel performing inactive duty training (drill) will be considered
off-duty: when traveling to or from the place at which such duty is performed; or while remaining
overnight, immediately before the commencement of inactive-duty training; or while remaining overnight
between successive periods of inactive-duty training, at or in the vicinity of the site of the inactive-duty
training, if the site of the inactive-duty training is outside reasonable commuting distance of the member's
residence. NOTE: This definition is for mishap reporting purposes only and has no relation to
compensability or line-of-duty determination.
ON-DUTY—DOD personnel are on-duty when:
Physically present at any location where they are to perform their officially assigned work. Officially
assigned work includes organization-sponsored events an employee is permitted to attend, regardless of
location. This includes those activities incident to normal work activities that occur on DoD installations,
such as lunch, coffee, or rest breaks, and all activities aboard military vessels. NOTE: Personnel walking
to and from work place parking areas at the start and end of the duty day are in an on-duty status.
Being transported by DOD or commercial conveyance to perform officially assigned work. (This includes
travel in PMVs or commercial conveyances while performing official duty, but not routine travel to and
from work.)
On temporary duty. Personnel on assignment away from the regular place of employment are covered 24
hours a day for any injury or occupational illness that results from activities essential or incidental to the
temporary assignment. Essential or incidental activities include travel between places of business or lodg-
ing and eating establishments, drugstores, barbershops, places of worship, cleaning establishments, bowl-
ing centers, officer and enlisted clubs, gymnasiums, and similar on-base non-appropriated fund (NAF)
facilities and similar places required for the health or comfort of the member, are considered on-duty.
However, when personnel deviate from the normal incidents of the trip and become involved in activities,
AFMAN91-224_ACCSUP_I 4 MARCH 2005                                                                          37


personal or otherwise, that are not reasonably incidental to the duties of the temporary assignment con-
templated by the employer, the person ceases to be considered on-duty for investigation and reporting
purposes of injuries or occupational illnesses. Injuries or occupational illnesses to personnel resulting
from activities unrelated to the temporary duty assignment or non-commander directed sports and recre-
ation activities (e.g. jogging, golfing, basketball) will be reported as off-duty mishaps.
Military members are working in part-time Non-appropriated Fund (NAF) positions. NOTE: Use the
NAF position series (instead of the military Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) for safety reporting.
Taking part in compulsory physical fitness training, sporting events, and physical fitness evaluation activ-
ities (including cycle ergometric testing when permitted). On-duty compulsory fitness training and activ-
ities include directed sports activities at professional military education (PME) and formal training
courses such as Basic Military Training, Technical Training Schools, Airman Leadership School, Squad-
ron Officer School, and the Air Force Academy. These activities are considered on-duty when a superior
directs participation at a specific location and time. This includes supervision-directed physical condition-
ing activities when a mandatory location and time are designated. Air Force civilian employees autho-
rized to participate in physical fitness activities during normal duty hours are also on-duty.
NOTE: The definitions above are for mishap reporting purposes only and have no relation to compens-
ability or line-of-duty determination.
PERMANENT PARTIAL DISABILITY (Class B)—Any injury or occupational illness that does not
result in death or permanent total disability, but in the opinion of competent medical authority, results in
permanent impairment through loss or loss of use of any part of the body. EXCEPTIONS: Loss of teeth,
fingernails, toenails; loss of fingertips or toe tips without bone involvement; repairable inguinal hernia;
disfigurement; sprains or strains that do not cause permanent limitation of motion.
PERMANENT TOTAL DISABILITY (Class A)—Any nonfatal injury or occupational illness that, in
the opinion of competent medical authority, permanently and totally incapacitates a person to the extent
that he or she cannot follow any gainful occupation and results in a medical discharge, retirement,
separation. The loss, or the loss of use of both hands, both feet, both eyes, or a combination of any of those
body parts as a result of a single mishap will be considered as a permanent total disability. For purposes of
this instruction, any mishap resulting in injury severe enough for an individual to be in a non-medically
induced coma is a permanent total disability. (NOTE: Upgrade injury to a fatal mishap if death occurs
within 30 days of medical discharge, retirement, or separation from service due to complications arising
from the mishap injury).
PHYSICAL AND ATHLETIC CONDITIONING MISHAP—Mishaps involving injuries that occur
during participation in some form of duty related athletic or recreational sport activities designed to
develop an Air Force member’s physical ability or to maintain or increase individual/collective combat
and/or peacekeeping skills. Examples are: firefighter injured during weight-lifting or basketball game to
maintain physical conditioning; Air Force fitness testing, compulsory sport exercises, unit formation
activities, physical fitness activities during professional military education courses, or individual physical
workout to meet Air Force physical fitness standards (see TRAINING RELATED DEATH).
PRIVATE MOTOR VEHICLE (PMV)—A non-commercial vehicle that is neither a GMV nor GVO. A
vehicle normally registered for highway use.
PRIVATE MOTOR VEHICLE (PMV) MISHAP—A motor vehicle mishap, regardless of identity of
the operator, that does not involve a GMV or GVO, but results in a fatality or reportable injury to military
38                                                                        AFMAN91-224_ACCSUP_I 4 MARCH 2005


personnel on- or off-duty or to on-duty civilian personnel, or reportable damage to DoD property.
Fatalities and injuries to bicyclists and pedestrians in the traffic environment are included in this category.
RECOMMENDATIONS—Recommendations are feasible and effective solutions to eliminate identified
hazards, or if the hazard cannot be eliminated, to mitigate the hazard’s potential consequences. Actions
likely to prevent a similar mishap or reduce its effects.
SAFETY REPORT—Safety reports include message reports (preliminary, status, and final), formal
reports, and injury and occupational illness forms and logs.
SINGLE MANAGER—The single individual specifically designated, under the integrated weapon
system management architecture, to be responsible for the life cycle management of a system or end-item.
The Single Manager is the program manager vested with full authority, responsibility, and resources to
execute and support an approved Air Force program. A list of the Single Manager organizations and

SPORTS AND RECREATION MISHAP—Mishaps involving injuries that occur during participation
in some form of sporting or recreational activity. Examples of sports and recreational activities include
softball, handball, golf, football, sight seeing, dancing, auto racing, bicycling, motorcycles driven
off-road, off-duty parachuting/sky diving, and flying private planes, ultra lights, and gliders.
TRAINING RELATED DEATH—A death associated with a non-combat military exercise or training
activity that is designed to develop a military member's physical ability or to maintain or increase
individual/collective combat and/or peacekeeping skills, and is due to either a mishap or the result of
natural causes occurring during or within one hour after any training activity where the exercise or
activity could be a contributing factor. NOTE: The cause of death must be attributed to the mandatory
physical exercise as determined by a competent medical authority.

                  INSTRUCTIONS ON ASSEMBLING A FORMAL REPORT.

A2.1. General Information.
   A2.1.1. Ground formal reports must have two parts:
      A2.1.1.1. Part 1, Factual Information and Releasable Material, may be disclosed outside the Air
      Force.
      A2.1.1.2. Part 2, Board Conclusions and Non-Releasable Material, will not be disclosed outside
      the Air Force safety channels. See AFI 91-204, Chapter 3, for authorized use and release of priv-
      ileged safety reports and information.
   A2.1.2. Investigators must use appropriate AF Form 711-series forms to document formal reports.
   All AF Form 711-series forms are available on the Air Force Electronic Publications Web page at
   http://www.e-publishing.af.mil.
   A2.1.3. SIBs and SIOs should make electronic versions of formal reports. Formal reports will be con-
   structed both in traditional paper form and electronic CD form as necessary. Minimize the number of
   hard copies produced. As a minimum, HQ AFSC is sent the original and one CD (CD-R) version. The
   convening authority will be provided one paper copy and one CD version, while all others may
   receive an electronic version (CD-R or diskette). See Table 6.2. for organizations receiving the formal
   reports.
      A2.1.3.1. Safety investigation boards or SIOs creating electronic formal reports will use
      Microsoft Word and then convert them to Adobe Acrobat, pdf files.
      Reports are typically saved as two (2) files: Part 1 (non-privileged) and Part 2
      (privileged). Reports will be saved on CD-ROM media, preferably on a "CD/R."
      A2.1.3.2. The CD must be labeled with: (as a minimum) mishap number, date and time of the
      mishap, mishap category, duty status, injuries sustained, unit and command experiencing the loss,
      report copy number, and the safety privilege warning statement.

A2.2. Administrative Guidelines for assembling Formal Ground Mishap Reports. These requirements
will be adhered to for conformity reasons.
   A2.2.1. Assemble the report in a legal size folder or most appropriate binder for size.
   A2.2.2. Use the AF IMT 711A, USAF Mishap Safety Checklist and Index, will be the first document
   in the report followed by the applicable tabs. This form is used to show which Tabs are included in the
   formal report. Place an "X" for each item in the columns "Not Applicable," "Applicable Not
   Attached," or "Attached."
      A2.2.2.1. When checking the "Applicable Not Attached" block explain why in the "Remarks"
      section.
          A2.2.2.1.1. Estimate the date the missing attachment will be sent for inclusion in the report.
          A2.2.2.1.2. If an attachment will be sent later, insert a blank page with the proper lettered tab
          in the report.
40                                                        AFMAN91-224_ACCSUP_I 4 MARCH 2005


            A2.2.2.1.3. Later, when the attachment is sent to recipients of the report, it can put it in the
            report at the proper tab.
     A2.2.3. Type/print in black ink on both sides of 8.5 by 11 inch paper. Use Times New Roman, 12
     point for text documents.
     A2.2.4. Under Page Set-Up in Microsoft Word (or other word processing program) follows these
     guidelines):
        A2.2.4.1. Set Top and Bottom margins at one inch.
        A2.2.4.2. Select "Mirror Margins" and set "inside" to 1.5 inches, "outside" to 1.0 inch. Set "gut-
        ter" to zero. (If you do not have a duplex printer, this will set the margins correctly for front-back
        reproduction. If you have a duplex printer this is the same as setting the left margin to 1.5 inches
        and deselecting "Mirror Margins").
        A2.2.4.3. Set header margin to .5 inches and ensure the class, category, sub- category, cross-cate-
        gory, report type, base code, mishap date and AFSAS number is inserted. An example: CLASS B
        GROUND, OFF DUTY MILITARY - MISCELLANEOUS, NONE, FINAL REPORT,
        XXXX20030920 12345B
            A2.2.4.3.1. Type it in 10 point Times New Roman, italicize, and center.
            A2.2.4.3.2. For motor vehicle mishaps also indicate the number of wheels (e.g. two or
            four-wheel) and vehicle category (e.g., GMV, GVO, or PMV).
        A2.2.4.4. Place a footer on each page in Part 2 of the report (privileged section) using information
        provided in AFI 91-204, Attachment 3.
        A2.2.4.5. Arrange the tabs in alphabetical order, with Tab A on top. Additionally, most Tabs now
        have "sub-tabs." Each tab is discussed in detail in the paragraphs below.
            A2.2.4.5.1. The first page of each tab will have the title of the tab, followed by a table of con-
            tents showing where to find information for each tab’s “sub-tab.”
            A2.2.4.5.2. Number all pages in order within the tab (for example, A-1, A-2, X-1, X-2, Y-1,
            Y-2).
            A2.2.4.5.3. Center page numbers at the bottom of each page.
        A2.2.4.6. For classified pages, use the proper security classification markings from AFI 31-401.
     A2.2.5. Do not place special handling markings on unclassified pages in Part 1 of the formal report,
     for example do not use "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY" footers. Ensure the Privilege Warning is
     located at the foot of each page of Part 2 of the Formal report. For classified documents, add the
     proper security classification marking from AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management,
     and omit the notation "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY".

A2.3. General Composition of a Ground Formal Report.
     A2.3.1. The following is a detailed description of the required tabs and sub-tabs commonly found in
     Part 1 and Part 2 of a ground formal report.

     mishap investigation. Include a copy of the submitted DR report containing the following infor-
     mation: Report Control Number (RCN), Cognizant Official, name of part (nomenclature), and part
     number.
     A2.3.2.9. TAB J. Releasable Technical Reports and Engineering Evaluations. If DoD or contrac-
     tor personnel provided written reports or on-scene evaluations, include them in this tab. Do not
     provide a promise of confidentiality to DoD or contractor personnel. When contractors are
     involved in ground mishap investigations ensure Figures A3.6. and A3.7. of AFI 91-204 are
     included in this Tab. Refer to AFI 91-204, Figure 5.1 for a recommended format for technical
     reports. Factual reports or information provided by a contractor or Joint ALC without a promise of
     confidentiality are placed in this tab. Any analysis referring to privileged information (e.g., board
     conclusions, etc...) should be included in Tab W.
42                                                     AFMAN91-224_ACCSUP_I 4 MARCH 2005


        A2.3.2.9.1. These reports should determine what parts are bent, broken, or burned; whether it
        happened before, during, or after the mishap; and how, etc. These reports will not state that
        certain systems or parts, "did or did not cause the mishap." The SIB will determine what
        caused the mishap, and that will appear in Tab T.
     A2.3.2.10. Tab K. Mission Records and Data. Not normally used for ground mishaps. If needed
     refer to AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports.

     A2.3.2.12. M. Data from Ground Radar and Other Sources. Not normally used for ground mis-
     haps. If needed refer to AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety Investigations and Reports.
     A2.3.2.13. Tab N. Transcripts of Voice Communications. These are written transcripts of
     recorded transmissions such as, Fire Department or Law Enforcement communications, Air Traf-
     fic Control to vehicle working on the airfield, as well as any other voice communications that may
     aid the investigator. Begin the transcript as early in the mishap sequence as is practical and end the
     transcript when all damage and injury has occurred. Long term rescue/SAR transmissions need
     not be included. Because these transcripts are factual data, they often provide a basis for informa-
     tion in the factual summary of circumstances. Do not include actual recordings in Tab N.
     A2.3.2.14. TAB O. Any Additional Substantiating Data and Reports. This is supporting data not
     otherwise defined. It can include local operating instructions (OI), directives, approach and land-
     ing charts, and other forms. If the SIB cites a brief document (such as a three-page local OI), place
     it within this Tab. Do not mark, highlight, or extract a particular page to show the SIB’s exact area
     of interest. (Highlighted pages are placed in Part 2 of the Formal Report.) For lengthy documents,
     it is sufficient to show a listing of documents or records reviewed by the SIB and their effective
     dates.
     A2.3.2.15. TAB P. Damage and Injury Summaries.
        A2.3.2.15.1. P1. Certificate of Damage. This lists the total damage to all government prop-
        erty, materiel, and equipment. See AFI 91-204, Chapter 1 for rules on calculating damage
        costs. Provide a detailed statement that includes acquisition, replacement or repair costs (as
        applicable) for all property, material, or equipment damaged. Include nomenclature and
        national stock number (NSN) if available. Attachment 3 of this manual provides an example
        of a Certificate of Damage.
        A2.3.2.15.2. P2. Statement of Damage to Private Property. Omit if no private property was
        damaged in the mishap. If private property was damaged, the Investigating Officer will draft a
        statement indicating the type of property damage involved (e.g. 20’ x 30’ x 15’ deep crater in
        NW corner of property, 5 acres of grasslands affected, etc.). The statement will not contain
        damage cost estimates, but only describe the damage incurred. Additionally do not state the
        cause of the property damage (e.g. 5 acres of grassland affected by post impact fire). Statement
        should be no more than a brief description of the type and extent of damage to civilian person-
        nel and property.
        A2.3.2.15.3. Include personnel injuries and identify their role in the mishap. List injuries in
        descending order from the most serious to the least serious.
AFMAN91-224_ACCSUP_I 4 MARCH 2005                                                                      43


     A2.3.2.16. TAB Q. Legal Board Transfer Documents. For ground reports, a Commander Directed
     Investigation (CDI) may be convened. If so, insert the appropriate information given to the CDI
     here.
        A2.3.2.16.1. Q1. When the SIB completes its investigation and reporting tasks, it will have
        numerous documents, non-privileged analysis reports, records, and other items of evidence.
        The SIB president, will turn over all of these and Part 1 of the formal safety report over to the
        Legal or Commander-Directed Investigator or local SJA office. This will be accomplished via
        a Memorandum of Transfer documenting each item turned over such as; Individual training
        records, Technical Orders, training plans, technical expert’s reports, and results from AFIP
        drug screening and autopsies, for example. Ensure both the SIB Board President and the legal
        investigator/SJA signs the Memorandum.
        A2.3.2.16.2. Q2. Wreckage Disposition Letter. Include a memorandum from the SIB Presi-
        dent or SIO regarding the location and disposition of all involved wreckage and components
        involved in the mishap sequence. This includes items sent to an Air Logistics Center or other
        locations for analysis.
     A2.3.2.17. (Mandatory) TAB R. Releasable Witness Testimony.
        A2.3.2.17.1. R1. List of Witnesses and Contact Information. Use this Tab as appropriate.
        Include a list of witnesses and involved personnel. Include the full name, organization, DSN
        and commercial duty telephone numbers, official mailing address, and indicate the person’s
        role in the mishap in general terms (e.g., witness, vehicle operator, passenger, etc.).
        A2.3.2.17.2. R2. Releasable (Non-privileged) Witness Statements and Interview Transcripts.
        Investigators take testimony from all individuals involved in the mishap and those who were
        witnesses to the mishap. Testimony includes both written statements and recorded interviews.
        Place testimony from individuals and witnesses that were not granted a promise of confidenti-
        ality in this tab. Do not include audio recordings. If a promise of confidentiality was offered to
        an individual, the testimony will be placed in Tab U. See AFI 91-204, paragraph 3.2.5. for dis-
        cussion of promise of confidentiality. All testimony must be properly documented stating if a
        promise of confidentiality has or has not been extended IAW AFI 91-204, paragraph 3.2.6.2.
        For non-privileged interviews, read, record, and transcribe the Notice to Witness that
        Recorded Statement is not Confidential (AFI 91-204, Figure A3.5). For non-privileged written
        witness statements, include a copy of Memorandum for Non-Privileged Written Witness State-
        ments (AFI 91-204, Figure A3.4). NOTE: There may be occasions, such as mishaps involving
        complex systems, military-unique items (such as laser devices or armored vehicles), or mili-
        tary-unique operations or exercises, where a witness or involved contractor will not provide a
        statement or information without a promise of confidentiality. When this appears to be the
        case, contact HQ AFSC/JA to obtain AF/SE approval to offer a promise of confidentiality.
     A2.3.2.18. TAB S. Releasable Photographs, Videos and Diagrams.
        A2.3.2.18.1. S1. Include releasable photographs and diagrams as needed to enhance the mis-
        hap narrative. Well-defined photographs help in mishap analysis. Use them to show damage,
        impact areas, metal fractures, vehicle travel, etc. Only include photographs aiding in under-
        standing the mishap, and reference them in the analysis in Part 2, Tab T. Use of scanned or
        color copies for reproduction in the formal report is preferred over pasting of actual photo-
        graphs. Do not include photographs of deceased personnel or graphic photographs of injuries
44                                                        AFMAN91-224_ACCSUP_I 4 MARCH 2005


           in the safety report. Place an index of photographs at at the beginning of the Tab. Do not refer
           to privileged safety information on the page captions or in comments on the index. Photo-
           graphs are privileged if they are staged for the board’s analysis. Staged photographs are placed
           at Tab T near the related narrative. Assembling or reconstructing damaged parts or aligning
           parts to show failure patterns or impact marks are examples of staged photographs. Pointing
           with a finger or other device at a portion of wreckage does not make the photograph staged.
           When investigators include privileged safety information on a transparent overlay, place the
           photograph with the overlay in Tab T and the photograph without the overlay in this Tab. Hold
           all photographs and videotapes taken by the SIB, except those staged for analysis, for use by
           the AIB. Every photograph and videotape needs to be labeled by the photographer. If a DoD
           photographer worked it, he/she should label the photo with name, office symbol, and office
           phone number. If a civilian worked it, then the investigator should label the photo with name,
           address and phone number (if the person will provide this information).
           A2.3.2.18.2. S2. Civil Engineering Diagrams. (Fallout, Impact Area, etc.). Ensure diagrams
           are self-explanatory. Include only those diagrams that add to the report such as wreckage pat-
           terns, impact areas, or route-of-travel. Indicate direction with a northward pointing arrow on
           each diagram. If practical, indicate scale. Ensure the diagrams do not depict the location of
           human remains. Such diagrams should be placed in Part 2, of the formal report to protect the
           privacy interests of the decedent’s family.
     A2.3.3. Part 2—Board Conclusions and Non-Releasable Material.
        A2.3.3.1. (Mandatory) TAB T. Investigation, Analysis and Conclusions. This is the most impor-
        tant part of the report. It draws on all portions of the report to provide a complete picture of what
        happened. It is a thorough analysis of all evidence and the findings, causes, and recommendations.
        This section records the opinions of the SIB/SIO, and it either accepts or rejects all scenarios or
        theories in the report. Only in the case of a minority report are there differing findings, causes, or
        recommendations. Life sciences recommendations related to causal findings will be included with
        other SIB/SIO recommendations.
           A2.3.3.1.1. T1. Authenticity. Include an authentication page after the last page of Tab T.
           Include each primary SIB member’s name, grade, position, and date on this page. Have each
           concurring member, including primary members from other services on Joint Investigations,
           sign above their name for authentication of the report or for any changes to the report. If a final
           SIB or SIO message report needs to be changed after it is completed the authentication page
           must be updated and inserted in front of the original.
        A2.3.3.2. (As Required) TAB U. Witness Testimony Provided Under a Promise of Confidential-
        ity. This tab can only be used when HQ USAF/SE has granted approval to give witnesses in
        ground mishap investigations promises of confidentiality. Before requesting HQ USAF approval
        to extend a promise of confidentiality to witnesses, investigators should first attempt to take state-
        ments from all individuals involved in the mishap or who were eyewitnesses to it. Investigators
        that feel offering a promise of confidentiality is the only way to collect meaningful, complete mis-
        hap prevention data should request approval to offer potential witnesses promises of confidential-
        ity. When confidential witness statements are taken, include a list of witnesses interviewed in this
        tab. Also, include those statements the SIB or SIO believe are pertinent. The promise of confiden-
        tiality must be clearly understood by those witnesses extended the promise (see sample memoran-
        dums in AFI 91-204. Non-privileged statements will be placed in Tab R.
AFMAN91-224_ACCSUP_I 4 MARCH 2005                                                                        45


        A2.3.3.2.1. Transcripts of complete interviews must contain the advisories in AFI 91-204 for
        written statement or recorded statement as appropriate. In cases where witness testimony is
        summarized by the interviewer, it must be clear that the witness was advised of, and under-
        stood the advisory.
        A2.3.3.2.2. Select only meaningful statements and testimony to include in this tab. It is not
        necessary to publish every statement taken from every individual interviewed. Place the state-
        ments and testimony of each individual together in chronological order with the earliest on top
        to make it easier to compare the individual’s impressions. Consider all statements and testi-
        mony included at this tab in the analysis at Tab T.
     A2.3.3.3. (As Required) TAB V. Other Supporting Privileged Products. Whenever findings or
     recommendations involve deficiencies in or changes to technical orders, checklists, local operat-
     ing procedures or directives, include the applicable portions of the original publications in this tab.
     The SIB’s/SIOs conclusion that a particular paragraph of a document was or was not a mishap fac-
     tor is privileged. Place highlighted pages or publication extracts revealing the deliberative process
     of the board in this tab. Include copies of submitted AFTO Forms 22 or AF Forms 847 here. Addi-
     tionally, statements made by persons found causal to the mishap should be filed in this tab.
     A2.3.3.4. (As Required) TAB W. Technical Reports and Engineering Evaluations Provided
     Under a Promise of Confidentiality. Normally ground safety investigations are not authorized to
     grant a promise of confidentiality. However if HQ USAF/SE has given approval to grant promises
     of confidentiality to contractors or technical specialists participating in ground safety investiga-
     tions (AFI 91-204, Chapter 3) who built, designed, or maintained the equipment and they pro-
     vides an engineering analysis under a promise of confidentiality, include the evaluation in this tab.
     If possible, include a factual summary in Tab N. Also, include memorandums of acknowledgment
     on protection of privileged safety data signed by these contractors when their evaluations are
     included in privileged formal reports (see sample format in AFI 91-204).
     A2.3.3.5. (As Required) TAB X. Privileged Photos, Videos, and Diagrams. Well-defined 8 by 10
     inch glossy photographs help in mishap analysis. Use them to show damage, impact area, etc. Use
     diagrams if photographs or other visual media are not available or specific. Ensure diagrams are
     self-explanatory, indicating mishap locations in association with structures, facilities, etc. Photos
     supporting analysis in Tab W may be included here or imbedded in Tab W for clarity.
        A2.3.3.5.1. Privileged Diagrams. Attach appropriate copies to all reports. These should be
        electronically scanned for electronic formal reports.
        A2.3.3.5.2. Privileged Videos. Videos of a mishap prepared for or by the SIB are part of the
        SIB’s analysis of the mishap. Include CD copies in hard- copy formal reports and save as
        MPEG or other similar file for electronic formal reports.
        A2.3.3.5.3. Privileged Animation. Include CD-ROM copies in hard-copy formal reports and
        save as MPEG or other similar file for electronic formal reports.
     A2.3.3.6. (As Required) TAB Y. Life Sciences and Medical Reports. Includes medical analysis,
     72-hour history, toxicology tests and any other information obtained by the medical evaluator. Tab
     Y may contain the following information and will be arranged in the following order:
        A2.3.3.6.1. Life Science Narratives, Part A and Part B. Part A provides a thorough discussion
        of all human factors contributing to the mishap and a discussion of all significant life support,
46                                                   AFMAN91-224_ACCSUP_I 4 MARCH 2005


        egress, survival and rescue issues. Part B provides a discussion of factors investigated and
        found not to be relevant in the mishap, and any other negative findings that the medical inves-
        tigator determines should be discussed to show how they were logically ruled out.
        A2.3.3.6.2. AFSAS Life Science Summary.
           A2.3.3.6.2.1. 72-Hour History. Required for all personnel (maintenance, operations,
           motor vehicle operators, etc.) whose action or inaction, in the commander’s judgment,
           may have been factors in the mishap sequence.
           A2.3.3.6.2.2. Life Science Consultant Reports when available.
           A2.3.3.6.2.3. Physical Examinations. Post-mishap physicals must be documented on a SF
           88. Include physicals for individuals involved in the mishap only if determined appropriate
           by the medical investigator, (include this information only in the report sent to HQ AFSC).
           A2.3.3.6.2.4. Any other reports obtained by the medical investigator, e.g., TOX tests,
           x-rays, autopsy reports, post mishap exam results, etc., that support findings or recommen-
           dations made by the medical investigator (include only in the report sent to HQ AFSC).
     A2.3.3.7. (Mandatory) TAB Z SIB Final Products.
        A2.3.3.7.1. Z1. Final Message Report. Include a copy of the SIB’s/SIO’s version of the final
        message report. MAJCOM comments will be added in the follow-up actions.
        A2.3.3.7.2. Z2. SIB Proceedings and BP Comments. The SIO or SIB may use this tab to tell
        reviewing agencies about investigation problems and make recommendations for improving
        reporting and investigating procedures. Comments on technical assistance coordinated
        through HQ AFSC are also appropriate.
