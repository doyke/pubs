This instruction outlines procedures for reporting EMI incidents and aligns reporting of EMI incidents
with AFI10-707_AFSPCSUP1, Spectrum Interference Resolution Program. This instruction applies to all
50th Space Wing (SW) organizations. Proposed changes or supplements to this instruction will be sent to
50 CG/CC for approval. In case of conflict between this instruction and unit publications, this instruction
applies.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
The revision of this publication is to meet the current 50 SW requirements. The sample EMI report has
been deleted.



1. General. Prompt reporting of EMI incidents is required for effectively countering hostile efforts to
probe, harass, deceive, and deny the use of Department of Defense (DoD) space systems, satellite com-
mand and control systems, communication systems, radar, and navigational aids. EMI incidents will be
reported to the 50 SW/CP Wing Operations Center (WOC). Units will use this instruction in conjunction
with AFI10-707_AFSPCSUP1 and AFSPCI10-202, Operational Reporting, Chapter 10, when reporting,
investigating, and resolving EMI incidents.

2. Responsibilities:
   2.1. 50 SW/CP (WOC):
       2.1.1. Ensures EMI reports are submitted to the appropriate agencies in accordance with AFI
       10-707_AFSPCSUP1.
       2.1.2. Contacts the 50 SW Frequency Manager upon generation of an EMI report as soon as pos-
       sible during duty hours.
2                                                                 50SWI10-215 13 SEPTEMBER 2001


    2.2. 50SW Frequency Manager:
       2.2.1. Maintains EMI Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for 50 SW. The EMI OPR is
       responsible for coordination with the unitâ€™s point of contact (POC) for follow-up resolution
       actions once EMI is reported. The EMI OPR will also maintain a file of all EMI reports for a
       period of one year.
       2.2.2. Assists the unit(s) with initiating the Quick Fix Interference Reduction Capability service if
       the unit(s) cannot resolve non-hostile EMI.
    2.3. 50 SW Group Commanders:
       2.3.1. Ensures all appropriate personnel in their group are trained to effectively respond and
       report EMI incidents. Training for EMI detection and data collection for EMI reports should be
       tailored to unit functions/mission.

3. EMI Reporting.
    3.1. All units will voice report EMI incidents to 50 SW/CP (WOC). In turn, 50 SW CP (WOC) will
    generate a message report in accordance with AFI10-707_AFSPCSUP1.
       3.1.1. EMI incidents will be reported using procedures detailed in AFI10-707_AFSPCSUP1,
       Paragraph 2, EMI Reporting.
       3.1.2. Report Specification. All units must specify their EMI report as an Initial, Follow-on, or
       Closing report, IAW AFI10-707. If the unit deems no technical assistance is required, it may spec-
       ify the report as an Initial/Closing report. For Follow-On and Closing Reports, as a minimum
       report day-time group event started/stopped, unit/site/location/system, unit POC, actions taken to
       identify source, and status of resolution (open/closed).
