       Attachment 3), current dated version, to prevent inadvertent release of STINFO data to
       unauthorized individuals and to indicate the appropriate distribution statement when
       marking documents.
    6.2. (Added-AFNWC) Training Requirements.
       6.2.1. (Added-AFNWC) STINFO training is required for individuals that may have
       access to STINFO material in any form (see definitions).
           6.2.1.1. (Added-AFNWC) Upon initial assignment to the AFNWC, all newly
           assigned personnel will complete the Introduction to STINFO module within 90 days
           of     being    assigned.          This     training    can   be    found      at:
           (https://afnwcportal.kirtland.af.mil/sites/AFNWC/Staff/Directorates/EN/STINF
           O/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx).
           6.2.1.2. (Added-AFNWC) All AFNWC personnel will complete the abbreviated
           refresher training on the AFNWC STINFO SharePoint site annually:
           https://afnwcportal.kirtland.af.mil/sites/AFNWC/Staff/Directorates/EN/STINFO
           /default.aspx.
    6.3. (Added-AFNWC) Meeting organizer(s) will notify their appropriate STINFO
    Officer/Liaison, unit security manager and, if appropriate, the local Foreign Disclosure
    Office (FDO) when hosting or conducting an event involving STINFO information (see AFI
    61-205) (contact your Local STINFO Officer for FDO contact information).
7. (Added-AFNWC) Marking STINFO Products.
    7.1. (Added-AFNWC) Document originators shall ensure all STINFO products are
    properly marked before dissemination.
       7.1.1. (Added-AFNWC) Regardless of the medium used, all STINFO information will
       be marked with the four markings for STINFO: (1) Distribution Statement, (2) Export
       Control Notice (if required), (3) Intellectual Property (IP) Notice (if required), and (4)
       Destruction Notice.
           7.1.1.1. (Added-AFNWC) The Technical Content Manager (TCM)/CDO shall
           ensure that all STINFO is marked with the appropriate Distribution Statement (as
           defined in DoDI 5230.24 Distribution Statements on Technical Documents) which
           includes the authorized audience, reason(s) for restriction, Identity of the TCM/CDO,
           and the date the distribution marking was placed on the document. Ensure the
           distribution statement is placed in a conspicuous location prior to user access to the
           information. Distribution control markings must be clearly discernible as documents
           and/or data are opened. Distribution Statements are used to mark technical data in
AFI61-201_AFNWCSUP_I 9 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                            9


         order to signify the extent of availability for distribution, release, and disclosure
         without additional approvals or authorizations. Distribution Statement markings are
         used in conjunction with classified markings (DoDM 5200.01 V3, DoD Information
         Security Program: Marking of Classified Information). NOTE: Distribution
         statements apply to secondary distribution only; they do not apply to primary
         distribution from the controlling DoD office.
         7.1.1.2. (Added-AFNWC) All technical data, classified and unclassified/limited
         must be marked with an export-control notice if they contain export-controlled data.
         Determining whether or not technical data is export-controlled is an integral part of
         the document marking process, and generally shall be accomplished before selecting
         a distribution statement. Only distribution statements B through F are permitted on
         export-controlled documents.
         7.1.1.3. (Added-AFNWC) An IP Notice is used to specify the IP rights (Unlimited
         Rights, Limited Rights, Government Purpose Rights, Small Business Innovation
         Research (SBIR) Rights, Restricted Rights, or Specifically Negotiated License
         Rights) attached to the STINFO. An IP Notice prohibits a competing contractor from
         viewing another contractor’s STINFO, unless special permission is granted by the
         owning contractor.
         7.1.1.4. (Added-AFNWC) Mark documents with the appropriate destruction notice
         (classified or unclassified).
8. (Added-AFNWC) Process for Distribution A Marking:
   8.1. (Added-AFNWC) Before marking STINFO with Distribution A, the document must
   be approved by PA. Until the product has been approved by PA, it will be marked “Draft:
   Not for Public Release.” In order to get PA approval, follow the process below:
      8.1.1. (Added-AFNWC) Document originator will send document to colleagues for
      preliminary review. The initial reviewers must as a minimum, include the supervisor,
      applicable program office/directorate, and the organization’s security function. The
      request for review shall include the name, organization, and role of each person on the
      review list (i.e., clarify in the body of the request who the supervisor is, who the security
      function is, etc.); where the document will be shared and when; date of requested
      feedback; and AFNWC Form 607, Air Force Nuclear Weapons STINFO Public Release
      Coordination (see Attachment 5). This process can be facilitated by using E-mail for the
      correspondence and including the appropriate offices in the cc field. NOTE: This review
      process does not replace the orginizations local review process, but is in adition to that
      process if the required reviewers are not already included.
      8.1.2. (Added-AFNWC) Document originator will address the feedback from the
      reviewers.
      8.1.3. (Added-AFNWC) Document originator will send document to their STINFO
      Liason, or the AFNWC STINFO Officer including the signed AFNWC Form 607 (or
      copy of comments and agreement to release), outline of comments received, and
      explanation of how comments were addressed.
 10                                         AFI61-201_AFNWCSUP_I 9 SEPTEMBER 2013


      8.1.4. (Added-AFNWC) STINFO officer will review the comments and how they were
      addressed, will verify the document’s information is not included in the Military Critical
      Technologies List (MCTL), and will ensure the coordination is complete. Once this is
      complete, the STINFO officer will forward the information to the appropriate EN
      functional, recommending concurrence that the material is suitable for public release.
      8.1.5. (Added-AFNWC) AFNWC/EN Director, or designated EN functional, will
      provide concurrence via AFNWC Form 607 or feedback addressing concerns.
      8.1.6. (Added-AFNWC) The steps listed in paragraphs 8.1.2. through 8.1.5. will be
      repeated until the EN Director concurs with public release of the document or determines
      release is not appropriate. If it is ultimately concluded that public release is not
      appropriate, the STINFO must be marked with the appropriate distribution statement.
      For STINFO that originates or is controlled by AFNWC units, the AFNWC Commander
      is the only authority to override this decision.
      8.1.7. (Added-AFNWC) STINFO officer will inform PA of the EN Director’s
      recommendation for public release, by providing a copy of the technical document and
      AFNWC Form 607.
      8.1.8. (Added-AFNWC) The PA office will address any concerns with the document
      originator. If the PA office does not have any concerns, approval for Distribution A will
      be provided.
      8.1.9. (Added-AFNWC) The document originator will mark the cover of the document
      with Distribution A and the release number that PA will supply after their review (see
      Figure 1.1.).

9. (Added-AFNWC) Responsibilities for Tracking, Publishing and Distributing Research
Development Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) Technical Reports (TRs).
   9.1. (Added-AFNWC) All RDT&E efforts are tracked from the start of the effort to the
   date the draft is due and on through distribution of the signed/accepted final by the respective
   STINFO Liaison.
   9.2. (Added-AFNWC) For RDT&E TRs, report preparers must meet the suspense dates
   defined in Attachment 6. RDT&E TRs are required to be published and disseminated within
   180 days after the completion of the technical effort. The following procedures are required
   for processing TRs through the STINFO Officer.
      9.2.1. (Added-AFNWC) The report preparer will contact the STINFO Officer/Liaison
      to have a TR number assigned to the draft TR, and ensure proper distribution statement is
      applied to the report.
      9.2.2. (Added-AFNWC) The report preparer will conduct technical and editorial
      reviews and coordinate the draft through the Security Office (if classified) and through
AFI61-201_AFNWCSUP_I 9 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                          11


     the FDO (if document contains foreign intelligence information). RDT&E TR Drafts are
     due 35 days after the tech end date to the Project Office/Directorate.
     9.2.3. (Added-AFNWC) The Project Office has 35 days to review, comment, and
     return draft TR to report preparer for any necessary corrections. The report preparer has
     30 days to make the corrections and send final report to project office for final review. If
     the project office accepts the report, the project office has 10 days to submit report to the
     local STINFO office for submittal to a DoD repository.
     9.2.4. (Added-AFNWC) Upon acceptance of the final, the local STINFO office has 10
     days to submit the TR to an approved DoD repository.
