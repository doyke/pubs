1. Minor administrative corrections and office symbol changes.

2. Information on where to send boards command action and a template reinstatement of Army
and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES), Commissary, and Morale, Welfare and Recreation
(MWR) retail facilities privileges letter was added.

3. The following has been deleted: 3.5.7.7 and 3.5.5.9.


1. POLICY. Acts of misconduct committed by family members may threaten the security and
safety of persons and property of Aviano Air Base. Family members who have engaged in
misconduct shall appear before the Family Member Misconduct Board (FMMB) at the direction
of and at the discretion of 31 MSG/CC. In lieu of convening the FMMB, 31 MSG/CC or
Mission Support Group Deputy Commander (31 MSG/CD) may take or recommend the Fighter
Wing Commander (31 FW/CC) take direct action against family members who have engaged in
misconduct, as provided by this instruction. Actions of 31 MSG/CC and the FMMB will be
directed toward ensuring good order and discipline on Aviano Air Base and, when possible,
rehabilitating the offender.
2. RESPONSIBILITIES.
     2.1. Military members and Department of Defense (DoD) employees have primary
     responsibility for ensuring their family members comply with all laws, regulations and
     applicable standards of behavior. Failure to do so may result in adverse administrative action
     against the offender, the sponsor or both.
     2.2. 31 FW/CC is ultimately responsible for ensuring good order and discipline at Aviano
     Air Base and may regulate the conduct of all active duty service members, retired members,
     DoD civilian employees, contractor personnel, persons employed by North Atlantic Treaty
     Organization (NATO) units and their family members thereon. 31 FW/CC has delegated the
     authority to resolve family member misconduct cases to 31 MSG/CC and 31 MSG/CD.
     2.3. The Area Superintendent, Department of Defense Dependent Schools (DoDDS), and
     other school administrators have primary responsibility for addressing disciplinary problems
     that occur on school buses, on school grounds during the school day and at school sponsored
     activities. Individual school principals are primarily responsible for sanctioning students
     who are involved in misconduct, and for making determinations regarding suspension or
     expulsion from school. However, 31 MSG/CC and 31 MSG/CD may also initiate corrective
     action, as consistent with this instruction, in cases where an act of misconduct disrupts the
     good order of the installation or otherwise threatens the security and safety of persons
     assigned to Aviano Air Base and/or their dependents.
3. THE FAMILY MEMBER MISCONDUCT BOARD (FMMB).
     3.1. Purpose. The purpose of the FMMB is to provide a method and framework for
     resolving cases of family member misconduct arising on Aviano Air Base, or involving a
     dependent of any person stationed at Aviano Air Base.
     3.2. Policy. The recommendations of the FMMB for corrective action shall promote the
     protection of life and property at Aviano Air Base, the rehabilitation of the offender, the
AVIANOABI51-203 22 APRIL 2013                                                                 3


  preservation of good order and discipline and the deterrence of the offender and others from
  engaging in acts of misconduct.
  3.3. Administrative Process. The process of resolving civilian misconduct issues is
  administrative, not judicial. Alleged offenders are not entitled to have legal counsel present
  during the hearing. Military attorneys from the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate and from
  the Office of Area Defense Counsel are not available to assist alleged offenders in preparing
  for hearings. Individuals may, however, retain civilian counsel at their own expense to assist
  in their preparation.
  3.4. Composition. The board is composed of the following persons or their designated
  representatives:
     3.4.1. Voting Members:
         3.4.1.1. Chairperson, 31 MSG/CD or designee.
         3.4.1.2. Law Enforcement Advisor, 31 SFS/CC or designee.

         3.4.1.5. Command Chief Master Sergeant (31 FW/CCC), in cases involving family
         members of military personnel.
         3.4.1.6. School Liaison Officer (31 MSG/SLO), in cases involving students.

         additional nonvoting representatives as required.
  3.5. Procedures.
     3.5.1. Reporting Misconduct.
         3.5.1.1. The 31st Security Forces Squadron (31 SFS) or the Air Force Office of
         Special Investigations (AFOSI) normally investigates cases of serious misconduct on
         Aviano Air Base. All reports of investigation disclosing misconduct committed by
         family members will be forwarded to the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate (31
         FW/JA) and 31 MSG/CD.
         3.5.1.2. Other cases of misconduct are reported to 31 SFS through the law
         enforcement desk and are documented in the daily blotter.
         3.5.1.3. 31 FW/JA shall receive all reports of investigation and daily blotter entries
         involving family member misconduct and may forward these to 31 MSG/CD with a
         recommendation on the appropriateness of referring the case to the FMMB for
         disposition.
         3.5.1.4. Unit commander and interested staff agency chiefs may report incidents of
         misconduct to 31 MSG/CD for consideration of a board hearing.

    3.5.2. Disposition of Misconduct Cases.
       3.5.2.1. 31 MSG/CD has several options in deciding how to dispose of a misconduct
       case:
           3.5.2.1.1. Refer the case to the sponsorâ€™s immediate commander for appropriate
           action.
           3.5.2.1.2. Impose any corrective actions, including those contained in this
           instruction, that are within his or her discretionary authority.
           3.5.2.1.3. Refer the case to the FMMB. A FMMB is required for any case where
           the misconduct may warrant corrective action that involves a revocation of base
           or retail shopping privileges. However, if the family member does not wish to
           come before the FMMB to request leniency or a re-instatement of privileges, then
           the family member is not required to meet the FMMB.
           3.5.2.1.4. Recommend that 31 MSG/CC take corrective action. In no way is the
           scope of authority of 31 MSG/CC limited by a decision not to convene a board.
           3.5.2.1.5. Take any other action appropriate to the circumstances of the case.
       3.5.2.2. If 31 MSG/CD is unavailable to review a case, or if 31 MSG/CD has referred
       the case to 31 MSG/CC for disposition, 31 MSG/CC may take any action that he or
       she deems appropriate. Such actions include, but are not limited to the following:
           3.5.2.2.1. Any action that 31 MSG/CD could have taken.
           3.5.2.2.2. Meeting with the sponsor, sponsorâ€™s commander and the family
           member who is the subject of the misconduct.
           3.5.2.2.3. Convening the FMMB.
       3.5.2.3. If the act of misconduct involves a violation of host nation law that may
       result in confinement, 31 MSG/CC or 31 MSG/CD shall consult 31 FW/JA prior to
       initiating action against the family member.
    3.5.3. Convening the Board.
       3.5.3.1. The board will meet at the direction of 31 MSG/CC or 31 MSG/CD to hear
       misconduct cases and provide recommendations on corrective action.
       3.5.3.2. 31 MSG/CD may decide to convene all members of the board or only
       selected members to review any case.
       3.5.3.3. Board member will not sit in judgment on a case involving their own
       dependents.
       3.5.3.4. 31 MSG/CD shall notify the family memberâ€™s sponsor and the sponsorâ€™s
       commander/supervisor of the time and place of the hearing and the nature of the
       alleged misconduct. Active duty sponsors and a representative from their command
       shall appear at the board hearing. Family members are encouraged to attend. The
       board may conduct in absentia hearings and may consider a family memberâ€™s willful
       refusal to appear as a matter in aggravation in deciding upon its recommendation.
AVIANOABI51-203 22 APRIL 2013                                                                 5


        3.5.3.5. 31 MSG/CD is the decision authority for all requests for delays of a
        scheduled hearing. Requests for a delay shall be delivered to 31 MSG/CD in writing
        and shall be no later than 10 calendar days from the day of notification. Delays will
        be granted only in extraordinary cases, or when the sponsor is TDY or otherwise
        unavailable.
     3.5.4. Board Hearings.
        3.5.4.1. The FMMB is an administrative hearing, not a criminal court proceeding.
        Formal rules of evidence do not apply. The Legal Advisor shall determine what
        evidence is relevant. The board shall consider all relevant evidence that is available
        for review.
        3.5.4.2. Persons appearing before the board are not entitled to counsel.
        3.5.4.3. Board hearings are closed to all persons except as designated by 31

        recorder.
        3.5.4.6. Upon convening the hearing, the Chairperson will ensure a thorough
        development of the facts. The Chairperson may permit the family member or sponsor
        to call witnesses and/or to submit written statements. The board shall solicit and
        consider the sponsorâ€™s recommendation for corrective action.
        3.5.4.7. The Chairperson shall devise informal procedures to ensure all members of
        the board are heard in the deliberations and consensus is reflected in its
        recommendation.
        3.5.4.8. After all evidence is presented, the board shall excuse all nonmembers from
        the hearing room prior to making its recommendation to 31 MSG/CC.
        3.5.4.9. 31 MSG/CC may accept the recommendation of the board, take any other
        appropriate action or return the case to the board for further action. Dissenting
        recommendations are appropriate and may be forwarded to 31 MSG/CC.
     3.5.5. Corrective Action. The board may recommend any one or more of the following
     corrective actions:
        3.5.5.1. An oral or written admonition or reprimand of the family member, the
        sponsor or both.
        3.5.5.2. Referral of the family member and/or the sponsor to the chaplain, Mental

6                                                       AVIANOABI51-203 22 APRIL 2013


       However, if there are legitimate medical or dental care needs that cannot reasonably
       be satisfied off base, then the member may petition the MSG/CD for a modification
       to their imposed restriction to allow MTF access.
       3.5.5.5. A curfew.
       3.5.5.6. Suspension or revocation of Armed Forces Italy (AFI) driversâ€™ license and/or

       3.5.5.9. (DELETED)

       Note: In accordance with DoD Instruction 1342.6-M, Administrative and Logistic

       the sponsor does not cooperate, where circumstances prevent the expeditious early
       return of the family member, where rehabilitative measures have failed or where
       unusual hardship to the family will result from separation of one or more of its
       members from the sponsor. Such action will be considered to be in the best interest
       of the government.
       3.5.5.14. Referral of case to Italian authorities for prosecution.
    3.5.6. Nature of Corrective Action. The nature of the corrective action imposed should
    be evaluated in light of such factors as the individualâ€™s age and prior disciplinary record,
    seriousness of the misconduct, deliberateness of the misconduct, defiance of authority,
    presence or absence of adult guidance and discipline, sanctions administered in like
    cases, adverse impact on Air Force or base community, impact of the misconduct on the
    victim and the rehabilitative potential of the offender.

       the board.

       A copy of the command action memorandum for record will be sent to the 31
       SFS/S5R, Reports and Analysis section.
AVIANOABI51-203 22 APRIL 2013                                                              7


        3.5.7.4. If the sponsor or family member refuses to consent to any corrective action,
        31 MSG/CC or 31 MSG/CD may reconsider the matter, taking the refusal into
        account.
        3.5.7.5. 31 FW/CC is the approval authority for all recommendations for restrictions.

        deadline for good cause.
        3.5.8.2. Appeals shall be in writing and shall be endorsed by the sponsor. No
        personal appearances are permitted in conjunction with an appeal.
        3.5.8.3. Appeals may be based only on these grounds:
            3.5.8.3.1. Newly discovered evidence proves that the family member is innocent.
            3.5.8.3.2. Information showing mitigating circumstances was not available and
            therefore was not considered at the time of the initial action.
            3.5.8.3.3. Circumstances of personal or family hardship were not considered at
            the time of the initial action.
            3.5.8.3.4. Appeal shall be submitted to 31 MSG/CD for concurrence or non-
            concurrence.
     3.5.9. Reinstatement of Privileges.
        3.5.9.1. Reinstatement of AAFES privileges is not automatic upon the expiration of
        the suspension period. Family members must contact their sponsorâ€™s first sergeant
        and submit a memorandum for record to 31 MSG/CD 10 calendar days before
        restriction ends. The memorandum must have concurrent agreement from the first
        sergeant and the unit commander on reinstatement of AAFES, Commissary, and
        MWR Retail facilities privileges. See Attachment 3 for a reinstatement letter
        template.

            RECIPROCAL SUSPENSION OF PRIVILEGES PROCEDURES

A2.1. This attachment defines the procedures to properly document and ensure that Base
Exchange and Commissary privileges suspended by the FMMB, or any similar program created
to manage cases of family member misconduct, are forwarded from the family memberâ€™s losing
base and are assigned to the family memberâ€™s gaining base. Suspensions and revocations of
privileges will be tracked through the Security Forces Management Information System
(SFMIS). SFMIS is a world-wide Security Forces database connected to the Defense Enrollment
