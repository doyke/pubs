                                  GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. Responsibilities. This instruction prescribes procedures for operating QF-16 aircraft under
most circumstances. It is not a substitute for sound judgment. Procedures not specifically
addressed (night operations, weapons employment, Night Vision Goggle (NVG) use, etc.) may
be accomplished if they enhance safe and effective mission accomplishment, by following the
guidance in AFI11-2F-16V3.
AFI11-2QF-16V3 30 JUNE 2014                                                                      7


                                           Chapter 2

                                    MISSION PLANNING

Section 2A—-General

2.1. Responsibilities. The responsibility for mission planning is shared jointly by all flight
members and the operations and intelligence functions of the 53 WEG. Accomplish sufficient
flight planning to ensure safe mission execution, to include fuel requirements, map preparation,
and takeoff/landing data. (T-1).
2.2. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. Bird Watch Conditions are
defined in AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, and AFPAM 91-212,
Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Management Techniques. The 53 WEG/CC will
determine local BASH procedures. (T-1).
   2.2.1. Takeoffs, landings, or low-levels within one hour of either sunrise or sunset during the
   phase II period increase likelihood of birdstrike. Significant bird hazards are published in
   FLIP GP, the IFR Supplement and local airfield guidance.
   2.2.2. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, pilots will make
   appropriate decisions based on observable bird conditions and seek assistance from local
   airfield personnel. (T-1).
   2.2.3. Pilots will consider bird migratory patterns during enroute portion of the mission to
   minimize the potential of an in-flight bird strike. The Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) on
   United States Avian Hazard Advisory System (http://www.usahas.com) provides BASH
   information, including regionalized CONUS bird migration, PFPS software overlay, and
   latest news. See AFPAM 91-212 for additional information. (T-1).
2.3. Standards. The 82 ATRS/CC and 82 ATRS DET1/CC may publish and approve unit
standards. 53 WEG Stan/Eval (OGV) will review all standards for AFI 11-series compliance
prior to publication. (T-1).
2.4. Flight Material Preparation.
   2.4.1. Mission Data Card (MDC). The minimum TOLD requirements on the MDC are:
   2,000 foot acceleration check speed (if computed takeoff roll exceeds 2,500 feet); refusal
   speed (dry/wet); rotation speed; takeoff speed; takeoff distance; normal landing speed and
   distance (dry/wet); heavyweight (immediately after takeoff) landing speed and distance
   (dry/wet). If computed takeoff roll is less than 2,500 feet, evaluate aircraft performance by
   comparing actual takeoff distance to computed takeoff distance or use a 1000 foot
   acceleration check speed. (T-1).
   2.4.2. Local Area Maps. A local area map is not required if pilot aids include jettison areas,
   divert information, controlled bailout areas, and provide sufficient detail of the local area to
   remain within assigned training areas. (T-1).
   2.4.3. Enroute Charts. Pilots may substitute FLIP enroute charts for maps on navigational
   flights within areas adequately covered by these charts.

        2.4.4.1. On low altitude flights, each pilot will carry a current map (updated using Chart
        Update Manual or electronic equivalent) of the route/operating area. It will be of such
        scale and quality that the detail of terrain features, hazards, and chart annotations permits
        navigation and safe mission accomplishment. Circle/highlight manmade obstacles at
        above planned flight altitude within 5nm of the planned route. Annotate time or distance
        tick marks and headings. (T-1).
        2.4.4.2. Annotate route abort altitude (RAA) using the IFR Off Airways guidance in AFI
        11-202V3 chapter 8. (T-1).
        2.4.4.3. For flights inside the Continental United states (CONUS) under Visual Flight
        Rules (VFR) or inside Military Training Routes (MTR), comply with the following:
            2.4.4.3.1. Use FLIP AP/1B and either sectional aeronautical charts or mission
            planning software (e.g. PFPS/Falcon View/JMPS). Select the following overlay
            options for PFPS/Falcon View: airports/heliports, airspace boundaries, airways,
            MTR, parachute jump and special use airspace boundaries. (T-1).
            2.4.4.3.2. Annotate Low level charts, or locally developed low-level route books ,
            with location and dimensions of class B/C/D airspace, military airfields, civil
            airfields, and other potential high density traffic areas (e.g., parachute activity areas
            and ultra light/hang glider/glider sites) within 5 NM of any planned VFR route or
            MTR lateral boundary. Annotate airfield approach control frequencies in the vicinity
            of class B/C/D airspace as well as the intersection of other VR/IR routes or other
            areas of conflict. (T-1).
     2.4.5. All qualified crewmembers will carry current checklists on every flight. (T-1).
2.5. Fuel Conservation. Manage aviation fuel as a limited commodity and precious
resource. Design procedures for optimal fuel use and efficiencies throughout all phases of
mission execution, to include ground operations, flight plans, power settings and climb/descent
profiles. Incorporate enroute tasks to make maximum use of airborne learning opportunities. (T-
1).
2.6. Overwater. Planned flights over water, outside of the local training area (e.g.,
deployments, cross countries, Programmed Delivery for Maintenance (PDM) inputs, etc) will be
accomplished two-ship as a minimum. (T-1). Single ship over water flights, outside of the local
training area, require 53 WEG/CC approval. (T-3). For deployments under ACC/AOS
movement control, AFI 11-207 waiver authorities will apply.
2.7. Briefing and Debriefing.
     2.7.1. All flight members will attend the briefing unless previously coordinated with
     unit/squadron supervisors. Flight leads are responsible for presenting a logical briefing to
     promote a safe and effective mission. Structure flight briefings to accommodate the
     capabilities of each pilot in the flight. Any item published in CAF/wing/group/squadron
     standards or AFIs and understood by all participants may be briefed as "standard." (T-1).
     2.7.2. Flight leads must plan adequate time to discuss required briefing items depending on
     complexity of the mission and pilot capabilities, and must start flight briefings at least 1.5
     hours before scheduled takeoff. Items may be briefed in any sequence, provided all
     minimum requirements listed in this AFI and AFI 11-202V3 are addressed. Additional time

  and CRM emphasis is required in D-model sorties especially on FAM and Incentive flights.
  Passenger must demonstrate oxygen regulator use, ability to establish multiple airways and
  mask removal after being strapped in. (T-1). Reference Attachment 2 for example briefing
  guides. All flight briefings will include:
     2.7.2.1. Weather and NOTAMs (T-1).
     2.7.2.2. Emergency procedures (T-1).
     2.7.2.3. Mission priorities and task management. (T-1).
     2.7.2.4. Significant rules (e.g. SPINS, Training Rules, ROE). (T-1).
     2.7.2.5. Flight member responsibilities and deconfliction contracts. Flight leads will
     brief a formation deconfliction/blind/get well plan for every phase of flight. (T-1).
  2.7.3. Low-level Briefings will emphasize (T-1):
     2.7.3.1. Obstacle/terrain acquisition and avoidance, bird hazards, emergency actions and
     weather avoidance with route abort procedures. (T-1).
     2.7.3.2. Employment of all Collision Avoidance Advisories, if available. (T-1).
     2.7.3.3. Human factors to include task prioritization, g-excess illusion, and perceptual
     issues associated with flight over water/featureless terrain. (T-1).
     2.7.3.4. Airfield approach control frequencies in the vicinity of class B/C/D airspace as
     well as the intersection of other VR/IR routes or other areas of conflict. (T-1).
  2.7.4. Dissimilar Formation Briefing. Emphasize proper position to ensure wingtip
  clearance, flight member responsibilities, and aircraft-unique requirements for each phase of
  flight. (T-1).
  2.7.5. Alternate Mission/Events and Multiple Go Days. (T-1).
     2.7.5.1. Brief an alternate mission for each flight that is less complex than the primary
     mission. Unbriefed missions/events will not be flown. Mission elements may be
     modified and briefed airborne as long as flight safety is not compromised. Flight leads
     will ensure changes are acknowledged by all flight members. Continuation training (CT)
     missions may fly primary or alternate missions in any sequence. (T-1).
     2.7.5.2. During multiple-go days when aircraft turn times do not allow follow-on mission
     brief(s), if all flight members attend an initial flight brief, the flight lead need only brief
     any changes for subsequent flights. (T-1).
     2.7.5.3. On multiple-go days, subsequent missions will be of equal or less complexity.
     Schedule and plan upgrade events on the first sortie only. If that sortie is non-effective
     for weather, maintenance or airspace, IPs may elect to accomplish the planned upgrade
     events in the second sortie. (T-1).
  2.7.6. Debriefing.
     2.7.6.1. All missions will be debriefed and address in-flight execution, flight member
     responsibilities, deconfliction contracts, event priorities, mission execution, and
     controller coordination/execution if applicable. (T-1).
 10                                                           AFI11-2QF-16V3 30 JUNE 2014


       2.7.6.2. Flight leads will review the video/audio record of all tactical portions of the
       sortie to assess flight members’ AGSM effectiveness. (T-1). It is imperative to evaluate
       not only during the G-ex, but also after the pilot has had time to fatigue--typically when
       the AGSM breaks down and G-induced Loss of Consciousness (GLOC) occurs. Pilots
       with poor AGSM technique or low G-tolerance will be identified to the operations
       officer. (T-1). The squadron commander has the option of directing refresher centrifuge
       training in accordance with AFI 11-404, Centrifuge Training for High-G Aircrew.
2.8. Unit Developed Checklists/Local Pilot Aids. Unit developed checklists used in lieu of
flight manual checklists must contain all items, verbatim and in order, unless specifically
addressed in the flight manual. (T-1). Pilot aids will contain:
   2.8.1. Briefing guides (reference Attachment 2 for examples). (T-1).
   2.8.2. Local radio channelization. (T-1).
   2.8.3. Appropriate airfield diagrams, to include cable/net barrier information. (T-1).
   2.8.4. Emergency information (impoundment procedures, emergency action checklists,
   NORDO procedures, divert information, search and rescue procedures, etc). (T-1).
   2.8.5. Divert base cable and barrier information. (T-1).
   2.8.6. Bailout and jettison areas. (T-1).
   2.8.7. Cross-country procedures to include: command and control, engine documentation,
   Joint Oil Analysis Program (JOAP) samples, and aircraft servicing. (T-1).
   2.8.8. Other information as desired such as: stereo flight plans, turn procedures, local
   training areas, and instrument preflight.
2.9. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA). Compute the MSA for each leg of the intended route of
flight in accordance with AFI 11-214. (T-1).

   3.1.8. Do not select CAT I on the Stores Configuration Switch with Category III
   configurations IAW T.O. 1F-16-1-2. (T-1).
3.2. Ground Visual Signals. Normally, pilot and ground crew will communicate by the
intercom system during all start-engine, pre-taxi and end of runway (EOR) checks. Use the
intercom system to the maximum extent possible anytime maintenance technicians are
performing "redballs" on the aircraft and for EPU checks performed in congested areas. (T-3).
Do not actuate any system which endangers ground crew prior to receiving acknowledgment.
(T-1). When ground intercom is not used, visual signals will be in accordance with AFI 11-218,
Aircraft Operation and Movement on the Ground, and this volume. (T-1). The crew chief will
repeat the given signal when it is safe to operate the system. (T-1).
   3.2.1. The following signals augment AFI 11-218:
       3.2.1.1. EPU OPERATIONAL CHECK. Raise two fingers and rotate hand. (T-1).

       3.2.1.5. GUN ARMAMENT CHECK (if required). Point index finger forward with
       thumb upward simulating a pistol and shake head (yes or no). (T-1).
 12                                                          AFI11-2QF-16V3 30 JUNE 2014


       3.2.1.6. EPU ACTIVATION. Raise hand with palm open and perform shoving motion
       indicating "stay away." Then cup hands over oxygen mask indicating hydrazine vapors
       may be present. (T-1).
3.3. Taxi and Arming.
   3.3.1. Taxi Interval/Speed. Minimum taxi interval is 150 feet staggered or 300 feet in trail.
   Spacing may be reduced when holding short of or entering the runway. Unless mission
   requirements dictate, limit taxi speed to 30 knots, 15 knots over a raised cable, and 10 knots
   in turns. (T-3).
   3.3.2. Ice/Snow Conditions. Do not taxi during ice and/or snow conditions until all portions
   of the taxi route and runway have been checked for safe conditions. (T-1). When ice and/or
   snow are present on the taxiway, taxi on the centerline with a minimum of 300 feet spacing.
   (T-1). Minimum RCR for taxi is 10. (T-3).
   3.3.3. Ice FOD Procedures. The following procedures apply when the conditions in T.O.
   1F-16-1 indicate engine damage due to icing is possible.
       3.3.3.1. If conditions warrant, the Supervisor of Flying (SOF)/Top 3 will have the first
       flight lead start 5 minutes early to check for inlet ice formation. (T-3).
       3.3.3.2. Position ANTI ICE switch to ON prior to engine start. (T-1).
       3.3.3.3. An ice FOD monitor must be available to monitor the engine inlet for ice
       buildup whenever the aircraft is stopped for an extended period of time (i.e. ramp/shelter
       and EOR). (T-1). Avoid standing water and snow/slush accumulations.
       3.3.3.4. Hold in the arming spot with an ice FOD monitor present until cleared for take-
       off. (T-1).
       3.3.3.5. Shutdown immediately if icing is visually detected and notify the SOF/Top 3.
       (T-1). Make an appropriate entry in the aircraft forms and qualified personnel must
       accomplish an intake inspection prior to restarting the engine. (T-1).
   3.3.4. EPU Check. Do not allow maintenance technicians to approach the aircraft until the
   EPU check is complete. (T-1). Use intercom or a "thumbs up" signal to indicate when safe.
   (T-1).
3.4. EOR Inspections and Before Takeoff Checks. Place hands in view of ground personnel
while the quick check inspection and/or arming/de-arming are in progress. (T-1). If the intercom
system is not used during EOR checks, the pilot will establish and maintain visual contact with
the chief and use visual signals. (T-1). EOR inspections will be accomplished immediately
prior to takeoff at a designated location, usually near the end of the runway or while departing
the chock area. (T-1). At non-USAF bases, make every attempt to coordinate an EOR
inspection with the host maintenance unit. (T-1).
   3.4.1. Forward Firing Ordnance. Do not taxi in front of aircraft being armed/de-armed with
   forward firing ordnance. (T-1).
   3.4.2. Flight members will inspect each other for proper configuration and any
   abnormalities. (T-1).
AFI11-2QF-16V3 30 JUNE 2014                                                                   13


3.5. Flight Lineup. Consider weather conditions, runway conditions, and runway width.
Minimum spacing between separated elements/flights is 500 feet. (T-1). Wingmen must
maintain wingtip clearance with their element lead. (T-1). If runway width permits, lineup with
wingtip clearance between all aircraft in the flight. (T-3).

Section 3B—-Takeoff and Departure

3.6. Takeoff.
   3.6.1. Do not takeoff when the RCR is less than 10. (T-1).
   3.6.2. Pilots will review takeoff data with emphasis on takeoff and abort factors such as
   short/wet runway, heavy gross weights, cable configurations and abort sequence in formation
   flights. (T-1).
   3.6.3. On training missions, do not takeoff if the computed takeoff roll exceeds 80 percent of
   the available runway single ship or 70 percent for a formation takeoff. (T-1).
   3.6.4. Ensure a compatible departure end cable is raised for all takeoffs and landings
   (including remotely operated cables). (T-3).
   3.6.5. 53 WEG/CC may approve intersection takeoffs if operational requirements dictate.
   (T-3).
   3.6.6. Make an afterburner takeoff anytime the computed MIL power takeoff roll exceeds 50
   percent of the available runway. (T-1).
   3.6.7. Centerline Stores. Start the takeoff roll beyond a raised approach end cable unless
   runway length, runway conditions (wet/icy), winds, gross weight or cable availability dictate
   otherwise. (T-3). Exception: aircraft with a centerline fuel tank may takeoff across approach
   end BAK-12 arrestment cables with an 8-point tie down system.
   3.6.8. Minimum takeoff interval between aircraft/elements is 10 seconds (15 seconds for
   afterburner). (T-1). Increase interval to 20 seconds minimum for join-up on top of the
   weather. (T-1).
   3.6.9. After releasing brakes, aircraft/elements will steer toward the center of the runway.
   (T-1).
   3.6.10. Formation Takeoff.
       3.6.10.1. Formation takeoffs are restricted to two aircraft. (T-1).

   3.7.1. Day weather minimums for VFR join-ups below a ceiling are 1,500 foot ceiling and 3
   miles (5 km) visibility. (T-1).
   3.7.2. Flight leads will maintain 350 KIAS until join-up is accomplished unless mission
   requirements necessitate a different airspeed. (T-3). Pilots may delay AB cancellation to
   establish closure on lead or lead element. 53 WEG/CC may approve different climb and
   cruise airspeeds within dash one limits. (T-3).
   3.7.3. Battle damage/bomb check will be accomplished on RTB, when practical (i.e.,
   weather prohibits accomplishing BD check). This check is mandatory after expending any
   ordnance (T-1).
   3.7.4. Accomplish air-to-air systems checks above 10,000 feet MSL when practical. (T-3).
   3.7.5. For further join-up procedures, see Instrument Procedures (Chapter 4).

Section 3C—-Enroute

3.8. Air Refueling.
   3.8.1. Pilots undergoing initial or recurrency training in air refueling will not refuel with a
   student boom operator. (T-1). Lead/IP will announce when an upgrade or requal pilot is in
   the formation and will request a qualified (non-student) boomer. (T-1).
   3.8.2. Pilots will inform boom operator when refueling from particular tanker type (e.g., KC-
   10, KC-135) for the first time. (T-1).
   3.8.3. Quick flow procedures are authorized and will be conducted IAW ATP-56B and
   AFTTP 3-3.F-16. (T-1).
3.9. Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC) and Maneuvering Parameters.
   3.9.1. The following are the minimum altitudes for the prescribed maneuvers.
       3.9.1.1. Confidence Maneuvers/Advanced Handling - 10,000 feet AGL, except dive
       recovery maneuver (15,000 feet AGL minimum entry altitude). (T-1).
       3.9.1.2. Horn Awareness and Recovery Training series (HARTS) numbers 1, 2 and 3 -
       10,000 feet AGL. (T-1).

       3.9.1.4. Aircraft will not descend below 5,000 feet AGL during aerobatic maneuvering.
       (T-1).
   3.9.2. Avoid flight through wingtip vortices/jet wash. (T-1). If unavoidable, the aircraft
   should be unloaded immediately to approximately 1 G.
   3.9.3. Do not manually extend the trailing edge flaps in an attempt to improve aircraft
   performance. (T-1). EXCEPTION: Trailing edge flaps may be manually extended during
   low/slow (below 5000 feet AGL) if mission/test requirements dictate. (T-3).
   3.9.4. Do not attempt to bypass flight control limiters to improve performance. (T-1).
   Examples are: transfer fuel to alter center of gravity (CG), manual pitch override (MPO) to
   gain additional negative G or assaulting two limiters at low airspeed.
AFI11-2QF-16V3 30 JUNE 2014                                                                     15


   3.9.5. The minimum airspeed for all maneuvering is based upon activation of the low speed
   warning tone. When the low speed warning tone sounds, the pilot will take action to correct
   the low speed condition. (T-1).
   3.9.6. The following is guidance for Horn Awareness and Recovery Training Series
   (HARTS) (reference AFTTP 3-3.F-16):
       3.9.6.1. HARTS maneuvers will be flown in CAT-1 loaded aircraft only. (T-1).
       3.9.6.2. For all QF-16 Blocks, external tanks should be dry to avoid a faster than
       expected airspeed bleed-off due to excessive weight during the pull up, for all HARTS
       maneuvers.
3.10. Formation, General. Flight leads and instructors will ensure contracts, roles and
responsibilities of each flight member are established, briefed, executed and debriefed. (T-1).
Flight members will immediately notify lead if unable to fulfill basic responsibilities, contracts
or other assigned tasks. (T-1). Flight leads will avoid tasking element leads/wingmen beyond
their abilities without sacrificing basic responsibilities. (T-1). Reference AFTTP 3-3.F-16 and
AFTTP 3-1.F-16.
   3.10.1. The flight lead is always responsible for flight actions. (T-1). Wingmen will be
   prepared to take the lead when directed. (T-1).
   3.10.2. In IMC, the maximum flight size in visual formation is four aircraft except when
   flying in close formation with a tanker. (T-1).
   3.10.3. Do not use rolling maneuvers to maintain or regain formation position below 5,000
   feet AGL or in airspace where aerobatics are prohibited. (T-1).
   3.10.4. Use airborne visual signals in accordance with AFI 11-205, Aircraft Cockpit and
   Formation Flight Signals, or detailed in local procedures. (T-1). Initiate configuration
   changes for four-ship flights by radio call, when practical. When formation position changes
   are directed by radio, all wingmen will acknowledge prior to initiating the change. (T-1). A
   radio call is mandatory when directing position changes under instrument conditions. (T-1).
   3.10.5. Flight leads will not break up flights from visual or sensor formations until each pilot
   has a fix from which to navigate (visual, radar, INS or TACAN). (T-1).
   3.10.6. Lead changes.
       3.10.6.1. The minimum altitude for changing leads within a formation is 500 feet AGL
       over land or 1,000 feet AGL over water). (T-1).
       3.10.6.2. During limited visibility conditions (e.g. IMC) initiate lead changes from a
       stabilized, wings level attitude [see also Instrument Procedures (Chapter 4)]. (T-1).
       3.10.6.3. Do not initiate lead changes with the wingman further back than normal
       fingertip or route position, or greater than 30 degrees back from line abreast. (T-1).
3.11. G-Awareness Exercises (G-Ex) (Reference AFTTP 3-3. F-16 and AFI 11-214).
   3.11.1. A G-Ex is required if planned maneuvering will exceed 5G. Accomplish the G-Ex
   day or night, only in VMC, with a discernible horizon, and only when unaided visual cues
   are adequate to safely perform the maneuver. (T-1). If these requirements are not met, omit
   the G-Ex and reduce mission tasking to limit maneuvering to 5G. (T-1).
 16                                                           AFI11-2QF-16V3 30 JUNE 2014


   3.11.2. Unless performing a syllabus required event (e.g., chase of a G-Ex), flight members
   will follow AFTTP 3-3.F-16 G-Awareness Exercise Procedures. (T-1). Use on-board
   systems (e.g. air-to-air TACAN, Radar, data link) to establish separation prior to maneuver
   execution. (T-1).
   3.11.3. Conduct the G-Ex in order of preference listed below to help ensure the airspace is
   clear from potential traffic conflicts. (T-1). If practical, use ATC to help clear the airspace:
      3.11.3.1. Special Use Airspace (e.g., Restricted/Warning areas, Air Traffic Control
      Assigned Airspace (ATCAA), MOAs and MAJCOM approved large scale
      exercise/special mission areas).
      3.11.3.2. In VFR only above 10,000 feet MSL outside of special use airspace.
      3.11.3.3. In VFR only inside the confines of a Military Training Route (MTR).
      3.11.3.4. In VFR only below 10,000 feet MSL outside of special use airspace.
3.12. Tactical Formations.
   3.12.1. Tactical Maneuvering. Wingmen/elements must maneuver relative to the flight
   lead/lead element and they must maintain sight. (T-1). Trailing aircraft/elements are
   responsible for deconflicting with lead aircraft/elements and will do so vertically when
   required. (T-1). At low altitude, wingmen/trailing elements will deconflict high. (T-1).
   Trailing aircraft/element(s) will maintain sufficient spacing so that primary emphasis during
   formation maneuvering/turns is on low altitude awareness and deconfliction within elements,
   not on deconfliction between elements. (T-1). Normally, the wingman is responsible for
   flight path deconfliction, but the flight/element lead becomes primarily responsible when: (T-
   1).
      3.12.1.1. Tactical maneuvering places the leader well aft of the wingman’s 3/9 line or
      forces the wingman’s primary attention away from the leader (e.g., wingman becomes
      engaged fighter).
      3.12.1.2. The wingman calls "padlocked".
      3.12.1.3. The wingman calls “blind”. Primary deconfliction responsibility transfers back
      to the wingman once the wingman acknowledges a visual on his lead.
   3.12.2. Loss of Visual (“Blind”) Procedures.
      3.12.2.1. Flight members will call blind with an altitude to the hundreds of feet, i.e.,
      “Blind 16.9”. (T-1). The visual flight member will respond with “visual” and talk eyes
      on. (T-1).
      3.12.2.2. If the other flight member is also “Blind,” they will call blind with an altitude.
      (T-1). Lead will be directive to ensure altitude separation is maintained and direct the
      wingman’s flow direction. (T-1). Use a minimum of 500 feet (1,000 feet above 5,000
      feet AGL) altitude separation. Avoid climbs/descents through the deconfliction altitude.
      All flight members must visually clear their flight path. (T-1).
      3.12.2.3. If there is no timely acknowledgment of the original "Blind 16.9" call, then the
      flight member/element initiating the call will maneuver away from the last known
      position of the other flight member/element and climb/descend if necessary. (T-1). If
AFI11-2QF-16V3 30 JUNE 2014                                                                      17


       visual contact is still not regained, the flight lead will take additional positive action to
       ensure flight path deconfliction. (T-1). Scenario restrictions such as sanctuary altitudes
       and/or adversary blocks must be considered.
3.13. Chase Formation.
   3.13.1. Restrictions. Any pilot may fly safety chase for aircraft under emergency or
   impending emergency conditions. All chase events may be flown by IP/Flight Examiners
   (FEs) or upgrading IPs under the supervision of an IP. Qualified pilots, including Initial
   Qualification Training (IQT)/Mission Qualification Training (MQT) pilots who have
   successfully completed an Instrument/Qualification evaluation) may chase as safety observer
   for aircraft performing simulated instrument flight or hung ordnance patterns. Specialized
   missions (i.e., OT&E, Weapon System Evaluation Program (WSEP), live weapons delivery,
   etc) and training conducted IAW AFI 11-2QF-16V1, QF-16--Aircrew Training, may be
   chased by Mission Capable (MC)/Basic Mission Capable (BMC) pilots designated by 82
   ATRS/CC or 82 ATRS DET 1/CC.
   3.13.2. Procedures.
       3.13.2.1. On transition sorties, the chase aircraft will perform a single-ship takeoff. In-
       flight, the chase aircraft will maneuver as necessary, but must maintain nose-tail
       separation. The chase will not stack lower than lead aircraft below 1,000 feet AGL. In
       the traffic pattern, the chase aircraft may maneuver as necessary to observe performance.
       (T-1).
       3.13.2.2. A safety observer in chase will maneuver in a 30-60 degree cone with nose/tail
       clearance out to a range of 1 NM, from which he can effectively clear and/or provide
       assistance. (T-1).
3.14. Show Formation. Such formations will be specifically briefed and flown IAW applicable
directives. Refer to AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy & Procedures, and applicable ACC
directives for specific rules and appropriate approval levels to participate in static displays and
aerial events. (T-1).
3.15. Low Altitude Operations (reference AFTTP 3-1. F-16 and AFTTP 3-3.F-16).
   3.15.1. Airspeed and Altitude. The minimum airspeed for low level navigation is 300 KIAS
   and the minimum altitude is 1,000 feet AGL (or IAW approved step-down training). For
   IMC operation, the minimum altitude is the MSA (see AFI 11-214). (T-1).
   3.15.2. At low altitude, the immediate reaction to task saturation, diverted attention, knock-
   it-off, or emergencies is to climb to a prebriefed safe altitude (minimum 1,000 feet AGL). (T-
   1).
       3.15.2.1. For QF-16s equipped with GCAS “PULL-UP” command capability, when a
       “PULL-UP-PULL-UP” warning sounds, the pilot will take immediate action to ensure
       terrain clearance, while referencing the primary flight instruments. (T-1).
       3.15.2.2. QF-16’s with pilot-selectable GCAS Minimum Terrain Clearance (MTC)
       settings will set an altitude that does not result in “PULL-UP” warnings at normal
       operational altitudes. (T-1). Minimum MTC is 25% of LOWAT Category minimum
       altitude for all operations. Wings with significant tall trees in the operating area or VR
       routes will account for average tree height when setting MTC altitudes. (T-1).
 18                                                          AFI11-2QF-16V3 30 JUNE 2014


   3.15.3. Weather. Consult FLIP for minimum weather on a VR or IR route. (T-1).
       3.15.3.1. Deteriorating weather on a VR Route.
           3.15.3.1.1. Able to maintain VMC. If it becomes apparent that weather ahead will
           not permit continued flight on the VR, maintain VMC, slow down, maneuver to exit
           the route structure, and establish a VFR hemispheric altitude. (T-0).
           3.15.3.1.2. Unable to maintain VMC. Climb to briefed deconfliction altitudes
           (reference Chapter 2). Squawk applicable (IFF/SIF) modes and codes and contact a
           controlling agency to pick up an IFR clearance if required. Maintain preplanned
           ground track. (T-1).
   3.15.4. Obstacle/Terrain Avoidance. If unable to visually acquire or ensure lateral
   separation from known vertical obstructions which are a factor to the route of flight, flight
   leads will immediately direct a climb NLT 3 NM prior to the obstacle to an altitude that
   ensures vertical separation. (T-1).
   3.15.5. At altitudes below 1,000 feet AGL, wingmen will not fly at a lower AGL altitude
   than lead. (T-1).
   3.15.6. When crossing high or hilly terrain, maintain positive G on the aircraft and do not
   exceed 120 degrees of bank. Maneuvering at less than 1 G is limited to upright bunting
   maneuvers. (T-1).

Section 3D—-Recovery and Landing

3.16. Gear Checks. For a VFR straight in, call gear down no later than 3 NM final. For an
instrument approach (reference Chapter 4), call gear down at the final approach fix or published
glide slope intercept point. For an overhead, call gear down departing the perch. For a SFO or
FO, call gear down at base key. (T-1).
3.17. Angle of Attack (AOA). Final approach will normally be flown at 11 degrees AOA.
Pilots will compare the computed final approach airspeed with AOA. (T-1).
3.18. Landing restrictions. When the computed landing roll exceeds 80 percent of the
available runway, land at an alternate if possible. When the RCR at the base of intended landing
is less than 10, land at an alternate if possible. Do not land over any raised web barrier (e.g.,
MA-1A, 61QS11). (T-1).
3.19. Desired touchdown point and spacing.
   3.19.1. The desired touchdown point is 500 feet from the aim point. The aim point for a
   VFR approach is the threshold. The aim point for a precision approach is the glide path
   interception point. To avoid possible speedbrake or nozzle damage, touch down either past a
   raised approach-end cable, or 500 feet prior to the cable. With centerline stores, touchdown
   will normally be past an approach-end cable. Circumstances that may dictate landing prior to
   the cable include runway length, wind, runway condition (wet or icy), gross weight or an
   aircraft malfunction where full normal braking may not be available. Single-ship or
   formation landings with centerline stores may be made across BAK-12 arrestment cables
   which have been modified with an 8-point-tie-down system. (T-3).
AFI11-2QF-16V3 30 JUNE 2014                                                                19


   3.19.2. Touchdown spacing behind an aircraft while flying a 13 degree approach will be a
   minimum of 6,000 feet due to susceptibility of the aircraft to wake turbulence and
   speedbrake/tail scrapes. Minimum pattern and touchdown spacing between landing aircraft
   is 3,000 feet for similar aircraft (e.g., QF-16 following QF-16), 6,000 feet for dissimilar
   fighter aircraft (e.g., QF-16 following F-15) or as directed by ACC or the landing base,
   whichever is higher. (T-1).
       3.19.2.1. When wake turbulence is expected due to calm winds or when landing with a
       light tail wind, spacing will be increased to 6,000 feet minimum. (T-1). Under these
       conditions, moderate to severe wake turbulence has been reported out to 7,000 foot
       touchdown spacing.
   3.19.3. All aircraft will land in the center of the runway and clear to the cold side when
   speed/conditions permit. (T-1).
3.20. Low Approaches.
   3.20.1. Observe the following minimum altitudes: (T-1).
       3.20.1.1. IP/FEs flying chase position: 50 feet AGL.
       3.20.1.2. Formation low approaches: 100 feet AGL.
       3.20.1.3. Drone Chase: 100 feet AGL.
       3.20.1.4. Chase aircraft during an emergency: 300 feet AGL unless safety or
       circumstances dictate otherwise.
   3.20.2. During go-around, remain 500 feet below VFR overhead traffic pattern altitude until
   crossing the departure end of the runway unless local procedures, missed approach/climbout
   procedures or controller instructions dictate otherwise.
3.21. Touch-and-Go Landings. Fly touch-and-go landings IAW AFI 11-202V3. Do not fly
them with fuel remaining in any external tank. (T-1).
   3.21.1. Touch and go landings are authorized during IQT (with an IP on board or chase),
   Safety Pilot MQT, remote controller IQT/CT, and FCS/SAFE sorties provided the following
   restrictions are met:
       3.21.1.1. 7000 feet of runway is available.
       3.21.1.2. Operative departure-end arresting system is in place.
       3.21.1.3. Daytime.
       3.21.1.4. Military airfield or auxiliary airfields (e.g. Tyndall’s Droneway), or civil
       airports with a letter of agreement are available.
3.22. Overhead Traffic Patterns. Unless the 53 WEG/CC determines that local conditions
(e.g., threat condition, populated areas) dictate otherwise, do not fly overhead patterns with
unexpended heavy-weight ordnance (larger than BDU-33). (T-3).
3.23. Tactical Overhead Traffic Patterns. Tactical entry to the overhead traffic pattern is
permitted if the following conditions are met: (T-3).
   3.23.1. Published overhead pattern altitude and airspeed are used.
 20                                                            AFI11-2QF-16V3 30 JUNE 2014


   3.23.2. Specific procedures have been developed locally and coordinated with appropriate
   air traffic control agencies.
   3.23.3. The flight consists of a maximum of four aircraft (aircraft/elements more than 6,000
   feet in trail will be considered a separate flight).
   3.23.4. No aircraft offset from the runway in the direction of the break (the intent is to avoid
   requiring a tighter than normal turn to arrive on normal downwind).
   3.23.5. Normal downwind, base turn positions, and spacing are flown.
3.24. Closed Traffic Patterns. Initiate the pattern at the departure end of the runway unless
directed/cleared otherwise by local procedures or the controlling agency. An element low
approach may be followed by a sequential closed with controller approval. Plan to arrive on
downwind at 200-250 KIAS. (T-3).
3.25. Back Seat Approaches and Landings.
   3.25.1. An upgrading IP may only accomplish back seat landings when an IP is in the front
   cockpit. (T-1).
   3.25.2. During back seat approaches and landings, the front seat pilot will visually clear the
   area, monitor aircraft parameters/configurations and be prepared to direct a go-around or take
   control of the aircraft (as briefed by the rear cockpit IP) if necessary. (T-1).
3.26. Formation Approaches and Landings.
   3.26.1. Aircraft must be symmetrically loaded. (T-1). Consider symmetrical as those stores
   loadings which do not require an abnormal trim or control application to counter a heavy
   wing or yaw during takeoff and acceleration to climb airspeed.
   3.26.2. Elements will be led by a qualified flight lead unless an IP or flight lead qualified
   squadron supervisor is in the element. (T-1).
   3.26.3. Use a rate of descent similar to a precision approach. Fly a published precision
   instrument approach if one is available. If not, fly a non-precision approach or VFR straight
   in and reference available lighting systems (e.g., VASI, PAPI) for descent angle. (T-1).
   3.26.4. If the crosswind exceeds 5 knots, lead will position the wingman on the upwind side.
   (T-1).
   3.26.5. The wingman will maintain a minimum of 10 feet lateral wingtip spacing. If the
   wingman overruns lead after landing, accept the overrun and maintain the appropriate side of
   the runway and wingtip clearance. Do not attempt to reposition behind lead. (T-1).
   3.26.6. Do not make formation landings when: (T-1).
       3.26.6.1. The crosswind or gust component exceeds 15 knots.
       3.26.6.2. The runway is wet or reported wet.
       3.26.6.3. There is ice, slush, or snow on the runway.
       3.26.6.4. The runway width is less than 125 feet.
       3.26.6.5. Arresting gear tape connectors extend onto the runway surface at the approach
       end of 125 feet wide runways (excluding overrun installations).
AFI11-2QF-16V3 30 JUNE 2014                                                                    21


       3.26.6.6. Landing with hung ordnance or unexpended live bombs.
       3.26.6.7. The weather is less than 500 foot ceiling and 1.5 miles visibility (or a flight
       member's weather category, whichever is higher). This applies to chased approaches and
       formation low approaches.

Section 3E—-Other

3.27. Radio Procedures. Preface all communications with the complete flight call sign (except
for wingman acknowledgment). Transmit only that information essential for mission
accomplishment or safety of flight. (T-1).
   3.27.1. Radio Checks. Acknowledge radio checks, which do not require the transmission of
   specific data by individual flight members, in turn (EXAMPLE:               "2, 3, 4").
   Acknowledgment indicates the appropriate action is either complete, is in the process of
   being completed or is understood by the flight member. (T-1).
   3.27.2. Clearance Acknowledgement. All flight members will acknowledge understanding
   the initial air traffic control (ATC) clearance. If flight members are not monitoring in-flight
   ATC frequency, the flight lead will pass all ATC instructions to the flight. Flight members
   will acknowledge subsequent ATC instructions when directed by the flight lead. (T-1).
   3.27.3. Brevity code and other terminology will be IAW AFI 11-214 and AFTTP 3-
   1.General Planning, General Planning and Employment Considerations. (T-1).
   3.27.4. Ops Checks.
       3.27.4.1. Monitor the fuel system carefully to identify low fuel, trapped fuel or an out of
       balance situation as soon as possible. Frequency should be increased during tactical
       maneuvering at high power settings. Ops checks are required: (T-1).
          3.27.4.1.1. During climb or at level-off after takeoff.
          3.27.4.1.2. When external fuel tanks (if carried) are empty.
          3.27.4.1.3. Prior to each (D)ACBT engagement or intercept.
       3.27.4.2. Minimum items to check are engine instruments, total and internal fuel
       quantities/balance, G-suit connection, oxygen system and cabin altitude. If the G-suit
       malfunctions or becomes disconnected, terminate all ACBT maneuvering until normal
       operation is reestablished. (T-1).
       3.27.4.3. For formation flights, the flight lead will initiate ops checks by radio call or
       visual signal. Response will be made by radio call or visual signal. (T-1).
          3.27.4.3.1. During Ops checks, ensure the fuel quantity selector knob is returned to
          the NORM position. (T-1). Totalizer-only Ops checks may be used periodically
          during high demand phases of flight.
          3.27.4.3.2. For mandatory ops checks when external tanks are carried, each flight
          member will check the external tank(s) and add “Tank(s) feeding/dry” to the Ops
          Check. (T-1). Once the tank(s) have been confirmed and called dry, this may be
          omitted from subsequent ops checks.

3.28. Lap Belts. Use extreme caution when disconnecting the lap belt in flight due to potential
for lap belt buckle/side-stick controller/throttle interference.
3.29. Change of Aircraft Control. Both pilots of a QF-16B/D must know at all times who has
control of the aircraft. Transfer of aircraft control will be made with the statement "You have the
aircraft." The pilot receiving control of the aircraft will acknowledge "I have the aircraft." Once
assuming control of the aircraft, maintain control until relinquishing it as stated above. (T-1).
Exception: If the intercom fails, the pilot in the front cockpit (if not in control of the aircraft)
will rock the wings and assume control of the aircraft, radios and navigational equipment unless
briefed otherwise. (T-3).
3.30. Fuel Requirements. (T-1).
   3.30.1. Joker Fuel. A briefed fuel quantity needed to terminate an event and proceed with
   the remainder of the mission.
   3.30.2. Bingo Fuel. A briefed fuel state which allows the aircraft to return to the base of
   intended landing or alternate, if required, using preplanned recovery parameters and arriving
   with normal recovery fuel as listed below:
   3.30.3. Normal Recovery Fuel. The fuel quantity on initial or at the FAF at the base of
   intended landing or alternate, if required. This fuel quantity will be the higher of what is
   established locally or:
       3.30.3.1. All QF-16 Blocks 15 through 32 - 1,000 pounds.
   3.30.4. Minimum/Emergency Fuel. Declare the following when it becomes apparent that an
   aircraft will enter initial or start an instrument final approach at the base of intended landing
   or alternate, if required, with: (T-1).
       3.30.4.1. Minimum Fuel:
           3.30.4.1.1. All QF-16 Blocks 15 through 32 - 800 pounds or less.
       3.30.4.2. Emergency Fuel:
           3.30.4.2.1. All QF-16 Blocks 15 through 32 - 600 pounds or less.
   3.30.5. Afterburner Use. Do not use AB below 2,000 pounds total fuel or established bingo
   fuel, whichever is higher, unless required for safety of flight.
3.31. Radar Altimeters and Terrain Warning/Avoidance Systems.
   3.34.1. If the aircraft is equipped with such systems (CARA, DTS, PGCAS, etc.), turn them
   on for all flights. Set LIS altitude advisory as appropriate on all missions. (T-1).
3.32. ALOW Setting. Set the ALOW function of the radar altimeter at the briefed minimum
altitude, the command-directed minimum altitude, or as briefed, whichever is highest. (T-1).
3.33. Wind and Sea State Restrictions. Do not conduct training missions when surface winds
along the intended route of flight exceed 35 knots steady state. Do not conduct over water
training missions when surface winds exceed 25 knots steady state or when the sea state exceeds
10 feet (T-1). This is not intended to restrict operations when only a small portion of the route
is affected. (T-3). The 53 WEG/CC or equivalent is the waiver authority.
AFI11-2QF-16V3 30 JUNE 2014                                                                     23

                                INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. Head-Up Display (HUD) Use. Regardless of Block, do not use the HUD to recover
   from an unusual attitude or while executing lost wingman procedures except when no other
   reference is available. The HUD in QF-16 Block 25/30/32 aircraft has been certified as a
   primary flight instrument and may be used as a primary flight reference in IMC conditions.
   The HUD in all other QF-16 Block 15 aircraft may be used as an additional instrument
   reference only. No QF-16 Block may use the HUD as the sole reference in IMC conditions.
   (T-1).
   4.1.2. INS/GPS or EGI Use. The QF-16 INS/GPS and EGI are approved for enroute Area
   Navigation (RNAV). Neither RNAV nor GPS approaches are authorized.
   4.1.3. Simulated Instrument Flight. Simulated instrument flight requires a qualified safety
   observer in the aircraft or in a chase aircraft. The observer may occupy either seat of the QF-
   16B/D provided the intercom is operable. If available use the radar to aid in clearing the
   area. Pilots in QF-16A/C aircraft may not log simulated instrument flight without a chase.
   They may fly multiple approaches in VMC without a chase, but will place their primary
   emphasis on seeing and avoiding other aircraft. Chase aircraft may move into close
   formation on final for a formation landing provided simulated instrument flight is terminated.
   (T-1).
4.2. Takeoff and Initial Join-up.
   4.2.1. If weather is below 1,500 foot ceiling and 3 miles, each aircraft and element will
   climb on takeoff heading to 1,000 feet AGL before initiating any turns, except when
   departure instructions specifically preclude compliance. (T-3).
4.3. Trail Procedures.
   4.3.1. General. During trail formations, basic instrument flying is the first priority and will
   not be sacrificed when performing secondary trail tasks. Strictly adhere to the briefed
   airspeeds, power settings, altitudes, headings and turn points. If task saturation occurs, cease
   attempts to maintain radar contact (if available), immediately concentrate on flying the
   instrument procedure, then notify the flight lead. The flight lead will notify ATC. (T-1).
       4.3.1.1. Flight leaders will request non-standard formation from ATC. (T-1).
       4.3.1.2. ATC instructions issued to the lead aircraft apply to the entire flight.
       4.3.1.3. Normal spacing is 2-3 NM.
       4.3.1.4. Each aircraft and element will follow the No Radar Contact procedures until the
       aircraft or element immediately in trail has radar contact (if available) and called "tied."
       (T-1).
   4.3.2. No Radar Contact. (T-1).
       4.3.2.1. The flight leader will call initiating all turns. Subsequent aircraft must delay
       turns to maintain the desired spacing.
24                                                            AFI11-2QF-16V3 30 JUNE 2014


     4.3.2.2. Each aircraft and element will maintain 20 seconds or 2-3 NM spacing using all
     available aircraft systems and navigational aids to monitor position.
     4.3.2.3. During climbs and descents, each aircraft or element will call passing each 5,000
     foot altitude increment with altitude and heading (or heading passing) until join-up, level-
     off, or the following aircraft or element calls "tied."
     4.3.2.4. Each aircraft and element will call initiating any altitude or heading change.
     Acknowledgments are not required, however, it is imperative that preceding aircraft or
     elements monitor the radio transmissions and progress of the succeeding aircraft and
     elements and immediately correct deviations from the planned route.
     4.3.2.5. Each aircraft and element will maintain at least 1,000 feet vertical separation
     from the preceding aircraft or element until establishing radar or visual contact except in
     instances where departure instructions specifically preclude compliance. Reduce vertical
     separation to 500 feet if necessary to comply with MSA restrictions.
     4.3.2.6. In the event a visual join-up cannot be accomplished on top or at level-off, the
     flight leader will request altitude separation for each succeeding aircraft or element to
     meet the requirements of the above paragraph.
  4.3.3. Radar Contact (If available). (T-1).
     4.3.3.1. Each aircraft and element will call "tied" when radar contact is established with
     the preceding aircraft. Once all aircraft are tied, no further radio calls are required, except
     to acknowledge ATC instructions, unless radar contact is lost.
     4.3.3.2. In flights of three or more aircraft, use all available aircraft systems (i.e., radar,
     TACAN, AAI, etc.) to ensure that trail is maintained on the correct aircraft.
  4.3.4. Trail Departures. (T-1).
     4.3.4.1. Use a minimum of 20 seconds takeoff spacing.
     4.3.4.2. Each aircraft/element will accelerate in MIL or AB power until reaching 350
     KIAS (or as required by local procedures). Upon reaching this speed, the flight leader
     will set a pre-briefed power setting. Climb at 350 KIAS until reaching cruise Mach/TAS,
     unless otherwise briefed. (T-3).
     4.3.4.3. Make all turns using 30 degrees of bank.
  4.3.5. En Route Trail. Flight leads must brief airspeeds, power settings, and configurations.
  (T-1).
  4.3.6. Trail Recovery. (T-1).
     4.3.6.1. Trail recoveries are only authorized at locations where procedures have been
     established. Appropriate ATC agencies must approve and local operating procedures
     must address trail recovery procedures. As a minimum, procedures must address each
     recovery profile, missed approach, climb-out, desired and maximum spacing
     requirements, lost contact and lost communications.
     4.3.6.2. Limit trail recovery to a maximum of four aircraft.
AFI11-2QF-16V3 30 JUNE 2014                                                                      25


       4.3.6.3. Trail recoveries are authorized when weather at the base of intended landing is at
       or above the highest pilot weather category in the flight or approach minimums,
       whichever is higher.
       4.3.6.4. The flight lead must brief the flight on spacing, configuration and airspeeds.
       4.3.6.5. The flight lead must coordinate the trail recovery with ATC prior to taking
       spacing.
       4.3.6.6. Prior to wingmen taking spacing for the trail recovery, the flight lead will ensure
       that all wingmen have operative navigational aids and radar (if applicable).
       4.3.6.7. Accomplish flight separation IAW local directives and in VMC if possible.
       4.3.6.8. The formation must squawk as directed by ATC.
       4.3.6.9. ATC will provide radar flight following for the entire formation.
       4.3.6.10. Limit all turns to a maximum of 30 degrees of bank.
       4.3.6.11. Once established on a segment of a published approach, each aircraft must
       comply with all published altitudes and restrictions while maintaining in-trail separation.
       4.3.6.12. Unless local procedures establish defined reference points for airspeed and
       configuration changes, the flight lead must direct changes by radio. At flight lead's call
       all aircraft must simultaneously comply with the directed change.
       4.3.6.13. All aircraft must report the final approach fix.
       4.3.6.14. If contact is lost with the preceding aircraft, the pilot will transmit "Callsign
       (C/S) lost contact." The preceding aircraft will respond with altitude, airspeed and
       heading. Establish altitude deconfliction and coordinate a separate clearance with ATC.
       If contact is lost while established on a segment of a published approach, flight members
       may continue the approach, but must confirm separation via navigation aids. If
       separation cannot be confirmed, execute missed approach or climb-out as instructed by
       ATC.
       4.3.6.15. Flight leads will coordinate with local ATC prior to penetration if the trail
       recovery will terminate in a Precision Approach Radar (PAR) or Airport Surveillance
       Radar (ASR) approach.
4.4. Formation Break-up. Formation break-up from a visual formation will occur in VMC. If
IMC is unavoidable, breakup from a visual formation will occur in straight and level flight. This
restriction does not apply to trail formation. Prior to an IMC break-up, the flight lead will
confirm position and transmit attitude, altitude, airspeed, and altimeter setting. Wingmen will
acknowledge and confirm good navigational aids (reception of appropriate TACAN, ILS and/or
appropriate GPS/INS waypoint). (T-1).
4.5. Formation Penetration. (T-1).
   4.5.1. Restrict formation penetrations in route or close formation to two aircraft when the
   weather at the base of intended landing is less than overhead traffic pattern minimums.
   4.5.2. If a formation landing is intended, position the wingman on the appropriate wing prior
   to weather penetration.
 26                                                          AFI11-2QF-16V3 30 JUNE 2014


   4.5.3. Formation penetrations using radar trail procedures are authorized when weather at the
   base of intended landing is at or above the highest pilot weather category in the flight or
   approach minimums, whichever is higher.
4.6. Formation Approach. During IMC formation flights, do not change lead or wing
positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless on radar downwind or if required during a formation
approach with a QF-16 experiencing an Emergency. (T-1).
4.7. Instrument Approach Procedures. (T-1).
   4.7.1. Pilots will not fly any published instrument procedure (e.g. DoD, Jeppesen, ICAO)
   that requires airspeeds less than those specified in T.O. 1F-16x-1.
   4.7.2. The QF-16 is Approach Category E. If no Category E minimums are published,
   Category D minimums can be used, provided:
      4.7.2.1. A straight-in approach is flown.
      4.7.2.2. For the final approach segment, the aircraft is flown at 165 KIAS or less.
      4.7.2.3. For the missed approach segment, the aircraft is flown at 260 knots true airspeed
      (KTAS) or less. At high density altitudes 260 KTAS may require a KIAS below the
      speed specified in T.O. 1F-16x-1 and Category D approaches shall not be flown.

5.1. General. Reference AFI 11-214 for procedures and restrictions. In addition, QF-16 pilots
shall comply with the requirements of this chapter. (T-1).
5.2. Maneuvering Limitations. (T-1).
   5.2.1. Negative "G" guns jink maneuvers are prohibited.
   5.2.2. Minimum airspeed during low altitude offensive or defensive maneuvering is 350
   KIAS.
   5.2.3. All configurations are authorized for unlimited maneuvering as defined by AFI 11-
   214. Before conducting unlimited maneuvering in a CAT III configured aircraft, consider
   gross weight, drag, departure susceptibility and training requirements.

                     AIR-TO-SURFACE WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT

6.1. Simulated Attacks against off-Range or Manned Targets. When the aircraft is loaded
with expendable stores (e.g. bombs, external fuel tanks, TERs carted at the pylon), load
simulated weapons (zero quantity) in the SMS/MFD only on empty or uncarted/unexpendable
stations . Confirm the Master Arm switch is in OFF or SIMULATE prior to the first attack.
Flight lead will query and flight members will reply to a “check zero quantity, uncarted station”
radio call. (T-1).
6.2. Weather. In training, do not conduct climbing or diving deliveries with a ceiling below
2,000 feet AGL or level deliveries with a ceiling below 1,500 feet AGL. (T-1).
6.3. Pop-Up Attacks. Abort pop-up attacks if airspeed decreases below 350 KIAS (300 KIAS
above 10,000 feet AGL). (T-1).

                                           Chapter 7

                        ABNORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

7.1. General. Follow the procedures in this chapter when other than normal circumstances
occur. These procedures do not supersede procedures contained in the flight manual. (T-1).
   7.1.1. Do not accept an aircraft for flight with a malfunction which is addressed in the
   emergency/abnormal procedures section of the flight manual until appropriate corrective
   actions have been accomplished.
   7.1.2. Do not fly an aircraft with a tripped engine monitoring system (EMS) Go-No-Go
   indicator (Bit Ball) until maintenance has accomplished the appropriate procedures and
   cleared the fault.
   7.1.3. Do not taxi with a known malfunction of the nose-wheel steering system, the brake
   system, or a generator [Note: QF-16C/D aircraft may be taxied with a single generator
   failure (main or standby) if the other generator is operating normally].
   7.1.4. Once a malfunctioning aircraft system is isolated, do not use that system again unless
   its use in a degraded mode is essential for recovery. Do not conduct ground or in-flight
   trouble-shooting after flight manual emergency procedures are complete.
   7.1.5. In the QF-16B/D, the pilot in command is primarily responsible for handling in-flight
   emergencies. The additional pilot will confirm that all critical action procedures have been
   accomplished and will provide checklist assistance at the request of the pilot in command.
   7.1.6. For actual/perceived flight control malfunctions, pilots will terminate maneuvering
   and take appropriate action. If the problem was due to crew/passenger stick or rudder
   interference, the pilot will take positive action to ensure no further control interference
   occurs.
   7.1.7. When a fuel imbalance exceeds TO 1F-16A/C-1 limits, terminate tactical
   maneuvering and investigate. If the problem was caused by a slow feeding external or
   internal fuel tank and can be corrected, the mission may continue IAW TO 1F-16A/C-1. If
   not, terminate the mission. Instruments, deployment/ferry missions, level weapons deliveries
   and straight-through-non-maneuvering intercepts are authorized to reduce gross weight until
   a safe landing is possible.
7.2. Critical Action Procedures (CAPs). CAPs are in Attachment 3.
7.3. Ground Aborts. (T-3).
   7.3.1. If a flight member aborts prior to takeoff, the flight lead will normally renumber the
   flight to maintain a numerical call sign sequence. Flight leads will advise the appropriate
   agencies of such changes.
   7.3.2. Pilots who do not takeoff with the flight may join the flight in accordance with the
   brief or flight lead instructions. If a join-up is to be accomplished on an air-to-ground range,
   all events will be terminated until the joining aircraft has achieved proper spacing.
7.4. Takeoff Aborts. (T-1).
 30                                                            AFI11-2QF-16V3 30 JUNE 2014


   7.4.1. If an abort occurs during takeoff roll, say call sign and intentions when practical.
   Following aircraft will alter takeoff roll to ensure clearance or abort takeoff if adequate
   clearance cannot be maintained. The phrase "Cable, Cable, Cable" will be used to indicate a
   departure-end cable arrestment. The phrase "Barrier, Barrier, Barrier" will be used to
   indicate a departure-end net arrestment. Local procedures will address net barrier raising
   procedures.
   7.4.2. When aborting above 120 KIAS, or whenever hot brakes are suspected, declare a
   ground emergency. Taxi the aircraft to the designated hot brake area and follow hot brake
   procedures.
   7.4.3. If aborting at or above 100 KIAS, lower the hook. If aborting below 100 KIAS, lower
   the hook if there is any doubt about the ability to stop on the remaining runway.
7.5. Air Aborts. (T-1).
   7.5.1. If an abort occurs after takeoff, all aircraft will maintain their original numerical call
   sign.
   7.5.2. Escort aborting aircraft with an emergency condition to the field of intended landing.
   When other than an emergency condition exists, the flight lead will determine if an escort for
   the aborting aircraft is required.
   7.5.3. Abort the mission, regardless of apparent damage or subsequent normal operation, for
   any of the following:
       7.5.3.1. Bird strike
       7.5.3.2. Actual or suspected foreign object damage.
       7.5.3.3. Moderate to severe icing.
       7.5.3.4. Over-G (Note: Land as soon as practical out of a straight-in approach).
       7.5.3.5. Flight control system anomalies, including uncommanded departures from
       controlled flight (Exception: intentional departures from controlled flight conducted
       IAW a MAJCOM-approved syllabus), but not including flight control system lights that
       reset IAW flight manual procedures.
       7.5.3.6. Engine flameout/stagnation or shutdown.
       7.5.3.7. Lightning strike.
7.6. Radio Failure (NORDO). Reference AFI 11-205 and the Flight Information Handbook.
   7.6.1. NORDO in Formation. (T-1).
       7.6.1.1. A pilot who experiences total radio failure while in close or route formation will
       maneuver within close/route parameters to attract the attention of another flight member
       and give the appropriate visual signals. The mission should be terminated as soon as
       practical and the NORDO aircraft led to the base of intended landing or a divert base. A
       formation approach to a drop-off on final should be performed unless safety
       considerations dictate otherwise.
       7.6.1.2. If flying other than close/route formation when radio failure occurs, the NORDO
       aircraft should attempt to rejoin to a route position at approximately 500 feet on another
AFI11-2QF-16V3 30 JUNE 2014                                                                      31


       flight member. The NORDO aircraft is responsible for maintaining clearances from
       other flight members until his presence is acknowledged by a wingrock, signifying
       clearance to join. Once joined, the NORDO aircraft will give the appropriate visual
       signals. If pre-briefed, the NORDO aircraft may proceed to a rendezvous point and hold.
       If no one has rejoined prior to reaching bingo fuel, the NORDO aircraft should proceed to
       the base of intended landing or a divert base.               Aircraft experiencing any
       difficulty/emergency in addition to NORDO will proceed as required by the situation.
   7.6.2. NORDO during Missile or Air-to-Air Gunnery Firing. (T-1).
       7.6.2.1. Gunnery target tow aircraft experiencing radio failure will rock wings and
       continue the turn if an attack is in progress. The flight lead of the attacking aircraft will
       join on the tow's wing. Remain clear of the banner in the event it is cut. The tow pilot
       will use standard hand signals to indicate his difficulty. The flight lead will signal when
       the banner is cleared for cut with a slicing motion across the throat. After the banner is
       away and the flight lead determines there is no remaining cable, he will take the lead,
       RTB with the tow aircraft on the wing, advise the tower of the NORDO and establish the
       appropriate landing pattern. If cable remains, follow local procedures.
   7.6.3. NORDO during Recovery. (T-1).
       7.6.3.1. If a formation straight-in approach is flown and a go-around becomes necessary,
       the chase will go-around, pass the NORDO aircraft and rock his wings. The NORDO
       aircraft will go-around, if the situation allows. If the NORDO aircraft is in formation as a
       wingman, the leader will initiate a gentle turn into the wingman and begin the go-around.
       7.6.3.2. To signal the need for an approach-end arrestment, lower the tailhook (visual
       formation) or fly a straight in approach flashing the landing light (unescorted).
7.7. Severe Weather Penetration. Do not fly through severe weather. If unavoidable, flights
will split-up and obtain separate clearances prior to severe weather penetration. (T-1).
7.8. Spatial Disorientation (SD). SD has proven to be a leading killer of F-16 pilots. Although
SD is most common at night or in IMC, it can and has happened in day VMC. Reference
AFMAN 11-217V1 for information on the causes of SD, how to avoid it, and how to mitigate its
consequences.
7.9. Lost Wingman. (T-1).
   7.9.1. Priorities. The first priority is to establish safe separation from other aircraft (e.g.,
   tanker or wingman). Next, obtain a separate clearance to ensure obstacle/terrain clearance
   and clearance from other traffic.
   7.9.2. Prohibitions.   Do not practice lost wingman procedures in other than day VMC
   conditions.
   7.9.3. General Procedures. Simultaneously transition to instruments and inform lead while
   executing lost wingman procedures (ref AFTTP 3-3.F16 for amplifying data). Lead will
   acknowledge the radio call and transmit attitude, heading, altitude and airspeed. Once lost
   wingman procedures have been executed, permission to rejoin must be obtained from the
   flight lead.
 32                                                           AFI11-2QF-16V3 30 JUNE 2014


   7.9.4. Two- or Three-Ship Flights. (Note: If in three-ship echelon, refer to four-ship lost
   wingman procedures.). (T-1).
       7.9.4.1. Wings-Level Flight (climb, descent or straight and level). Simultaneously
       inform the leader and turn away using 15 degrees of bank for 15 seconds, then resume
       heading and obtain a separate clearance.
       7.9.4.2. Outside the Turn. Reverse the direction of turn using 15 degrees of bank for 15
       seconds and inform the leader. Continue straight ahead to ensure separation prior to
       resuming the turn. Obtain a separate clearance.
       7.9.4.3. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation and
       inform the flight lead to roll out of the turn. Maintain angle of bank to ensure lateral
       separation and obtain a separate clearance. The leader may resume turn only when
       separation is ensured.
       7.9.4.4. Precision/Non-precision Final. The wingman will momentarily turn away to
       ensure clearance, inform lead, and commence the published missed approach procedure
       while obtaining a separate clearance.
       7.9.4.5. Missed Approach. The wingman will momentarily turn away to ensure
       clearance, inform lead, and continue the published or assigned missed approach
       procedure while climbing to 500 feet above missed approach altitude. Obtain a separate
       clearance.
   7.9.5. Four-Ship Flights. If only one aircraft in the flight becomes separated, the previous
   procedures would provide safe separation, but since it is impossible for number 4 to
   immediately ascertain that number 3 still has visual contact with the leader, it is imperative
   that number 4's initial action be based on the assumption that number 3 has also become
   separated. Numbers 2 and 3 will follow the procedures outlined above. Number 4 will
   follow the appropriate procedure listed below: (T-1).
       7.9.5.1. Wings-Level Flight. Simultaneously inform the leader and turn away using 30
       degrees of bank for 30 seconds, then resume heading and obtain a separate clearance.
       7.9.5.2. Outside the Turn. Reverse direction of turn using 30 degrees of bank for 30
       seconds to ensure separation from lead and number 3 and obtain a separate clearance.
       7.9.5.3. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation and
       increase bank angle by 15 degrees. Inform the leader to roll out. Obtain a separate
       clearance. Leader will resume turn only when separation is ensured.
7.10. In-flight Practice of Emergency Procedures. Reference AFI 11-202V3. A simulated
emergency procedure is any procedure that produces an effect closely paralleling the actual
emergency. One example would be retarding the throttle sufficiently to emulate the performance
of an aircraft with a flamed out or idle engine.
   7.10.1. Prohibitions. Do not practice aborted takeoffs in the aircraft. Instead, use the flight
   simulator, Cockpit Familiarization Trainer or a static aircraft, in that order of preference. Do
   not practice in-flight engine shutdown. Do not practice SFO patterns unless crash rescue is
   available and either an active tower or a ROM (or equivalent, e.g. SOF) is in operation. Do
   not practice SFO patterns in conditions other than day VMC. (T-1).
AFI11-2QF-16V3 30 JUNE 2014                                                                   33


   7.10.2. Simulated Flameout (SFO)/Emergency Landing Patterns. 53 WEG/CC will establish
   specific procedures for SFO training and establish letters of agreement with appropriate
   agencies. The 53 WEG will publish those procedures in their supplement to this volume.
   General SFO procedures follow: (T-1).
      7.10.2.1. The SFO pattern may be entered from any direction or altitude that will ensure
      the aircraft is properly configured above 2,000 feet AGL and in a position to safely
      complete the approach.
      7.10.2.2. Do not initiate or continue an SFO if a potential traffic pattern conflict exists
      that would require division of the pilot’s attention between the SFO and sequencing with
      traffic. Discontinue an SFO whenever excessive maneuvering is required, whether as a
      result of a traffic conflict or when making corrections. Discontinue an SFO if unable to
      obtain wings level on final by 200 feet AGL. Discontinue an SFO if airspeed drops
      below TO 1F-16-1 minimum airspeed any time between base key and the initiation of the
      flare. Once the decision to discontinue an SFO has been made, initiate a go-around and
      do not attempt to resume the SFO. (T-2).
      7.10.2.3. Except when operating IAW a MAJCOM-approved syllabus (e.g., AFMC high
      angle of attack training), do not touch down from an SFO. (T-2).
      7.10.2.4. Make radio calls IAW local procedures, but as a minimum call. (T-2).
          7.10.2.4.1. "High Key"
          7.10.2.4.2. "Low Key"
          7.10.2.4.3. "Base Key, Gear Down, (Intentions)"
7.11. Search and Rescue (SAR) Procedures. General directive procedures are listed below.
53 WEG/CC will establish specific procedures in the unit supplement to this volume. (T-2).
   7.11.1. Squawk. Immediately cease tactical maneuvering by executing Knock-It-Off
   procedures. Place IFF to EMER to alert ATC/GCI/AWACS of the emergency situation.
   7.11.2. Talk. Establish an On Scene Commander (OSC). Communicate the emergency
   situation and intentions immediately to applicable control agencies. Use GUARD frequency
   if necessary.
   7.11.3. Mark. Mark the last known position of survivors/crash site using any means
   available, e.g. visual ground references, TACAN, INS, EGI, ATC/GCI/AWACS. Pass this
   information to follow-on SAR forces.
   7.11.4. Separate. Remain above the last observed parachute altitudes until the position of all
   possible survivors is determined. If visual contact with parachute is not maintained, allow
   approximately 1 minute per thousand feet (16 feet per second) for parachute descent. The
   OSC will establish deconfliction between all aircraft involved in the SAR.
   7.11.5. Update Bingo/Recovery Base. Revise bingo fuels or recovery bases as required to
   maintain maximum SAR coverage over survivor(s). Do not overfly bingo. Relinquish OSC
   duties to more qualified rescue forces (e.g., SANDY 1, US Coast Guard) upon their arrival.

                            LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

8.1. General. This chapter provides a consolidated framework for wings to supplement (IAW
AFI 33-360) local operating procedures. Units composed of multiple aircraft types may publish
guidance in a single, stand-alone local operating instruction instead of supplementing this AFI.
Added or stand-alone procedures will not be less restrictive than those contained elsewhere in
this volume. This chapter is not intended to be a single source document for procedures
contained in other directives or regulations. Avoid unnecessary repetition of guidance provided
in other established directives; however, reference to those directives is acceptable when it serves
to facilitate the location of information. This chapter is authorized to be issued to each pilot.
Units may supplement the following paragraphs for local operating guidance: (T-1).
   8.1.1. Section A. Introduction.
   8.1.2. Section B. General Policy.
   8.1.3. Section C. Ground Operations.

                                           Chapter 9

                  MANNED/REMOTE CONTROL PROCEDURES (T-3)

9.1. General. The QF-16 flight manual and local operating procedures are the primary
references for manned target operation and remote-controlled flight with the automatic flight-
control system (AFCS) engaged. Units will develop local procedures for operating NULLO QF-
16s, which is beyond the scope of this volume.
   9.1.1. QF-16 aircraft are expendable assets, and no mission is so important as to risk human
   life or endanger other assets. Pilots should, in all cases, consider ejection rather than attempt
   to recover an aircraft which might pose a greater risk.
   9.1.2. The procedures contained in this chapter are designed to provide pilots and controllers
   with standard methods of operation under normal conditions for qualification and
   continuation training.
   9.1.3. To acquire additional knowledge and experience of the target system capabilities and
   limitations, units are encouraged to exploit the capabilities of the system and promote aircrew
   proficiency in the target system in all anticipated environments.
9.2. Responsibilities.
   9.2.1. A Safety Pilot (SP) in a captive QF-16 is responsible to monitor aircraft performance
   as commanded by the remote controller and to take control if safety of flight is jeopardized.
   Certain conditions such as momentary loss of communication between the SP and controller
   or loss of down-link data by the controller may interrupt or delay normal crew coordination.
   Therefore it is absolutely imperative that the SP keep a high level of situational awareness
   (SA). If he feels he is losing SA he should immediately take control of the aircraft. The SP
   should disengage the AFCS at the earliest possible indication of a problem. The computer
   can out-perform human reaction, therefore the initial indication of a minor malfunction may
   be the only warning of a more serious problem. Under no circumstances will the SP rely
   solely on verbal warnings from the controller.
   9.2.2. The SP has ultimate authority and responsibility for safe conduct of the mission.
   Controllers of captive QF-16s are responsible for safety of flight of their aircraft until
   transferring control back to the SP, or unless overridden by the SP at any time. If the
   controller’s aircraft control capability becomes degraded, he will inform the SP. He will also
   notify the SP to take control when appropriate.
   9.2.3. The controller will verify the control console is correct and complete for all consoles
   to be used before the mission is started. If circumstances preclude this, the mission will be
   delayed or canceled as necessary.
9.3. General Manned Target Procedures.
   9.3.1. Prior to any captive flight, the SP will perform an operational check of the AFCS
   disengage paddle switch and caution light. If the switch is inoperative or malfunctions, the
   mission will be aborted.
 38                                                              AFI11-2QF-16V3 30 JUNE 2014


   9.3.2. During Automatic Takeoff (ATO) or captive touch-and-go landing, the SP will take
   control if the aircraft gets to within 25 feet of the runway edge. This does not preclude the SP
   taking control when in his judgment the situation is approaching abnormal operation.
   9.3.3. Unless specifically briefed as a mission objective or requirement, the SP will not
   engage the AFCS below 1000 feet AGL.
   9.3.4. SPs will use extreme caution during captive flight at low altitude.
9.4. General Manned Target ROE.
   9.4.1. SP has ultimate responsibility for safety of aircraft and safe conduct of mission.
   9.4.2. SP will maintain situational awareness at all times.
   9.4.3. SP will not rely on verbal warnings from controllers to initiate action.
   9.4.4. Controllers will continue to fly the aircraft until positive transfer to SP is assured.
   9.4.5. SP will guard the stick at all times below 5000 feet AGL.
   9.4.6. Improperly performed maneuvers should normally be terminated, based upon
   improper bank, speed, pitch or “G”. Maneuver termination may be accomplished by either
   the controller or safety pilot.
   9.4.7. If in IMC conditions or without a discernible horizon, the aircraft should not exceed
   60 degrees of bank or 30 degrees of pitch.
   9.4.8. When less than 2000 feet AGL, aircraft should remain clear of clouds. Without a
   discernible horizon, the aircraft should not exceed 30 degrees of bank, 15 degrees of pitch
   nose up, or 10 degrees of pitch nose low.
9.5. Weather Restrictions and Operating Limits.
   9.5.1. The ceiling and visibility for captive takeoffs and landings will be at least 1500 feet
   and three statute miles.
   9.5.2. During captive flight in IMC, do not exceed 60º of bank or ±30º of pitch. While in
   VMC, the SP will disengage the AFCS if these parameters are exceeded and it becomes
   apparent that flight into IMC is imminent.
   9.5.3. Remain clear of clouds during captive flight on-range below 2000 feet AGL. Without
   a discernible horizon, the aircraft should not exceed 30 degrees of bank, 15 degrees of pitch
   nose up, or 10 degrees of pitch nose low.
   9.5.4. It is the SP’s responsibility to ensure adequate terrain clearance will be available
   during coupled flight. If there is any doubt, the SP should disengage the AFCS and climb to a
   safe altitude and/or VMC conditions where terrain clearance can be assured.
9.6. Fuel Check Requirements. The controller will initiate a fuel check at level-off or upon
taking control (whichever occurs last) and periodically thereafter throughout the mission. Down-
linked fuel readings will be compared with cockpit readings (FUEL button on Remote Enable
Panel to “REMOTE”).
9.7. Chase Restrictions.
   9.7.1. The minimum altitude for drone chase (takeoff and landing) is 100 feet AGL.
AFI11-2QF-16V3 30 JUNE 2014                                                                      39


   9.7.2. Minimum weather for drone chase is a ceiling of 2500 feet and visibility of five statute
   miles.
9.8. Landing Patterns. The SP will terminate the mission if at any time the aircraft command
and telemetry systems appear to operating abnormally.
   9.8.1. Prior to the first captive approach and landing, the SP will verbally confirm "Brakes
   Normal" and leave the brakes button in NORMAL until attempting a full-stop landing. Calls
   are not required for subsequent approaches and landings on the same sortie. The SP will
   place and verbally confirm “Brakes Remote” for a full-stop landing.
   9.8.2. Touch-and-go landings are authorized on captive missions for controller continuation
   training, but a qualified SP must be on board the aircraft. After touchdowns, the SP or chase
   pilot (as briefed) will give appropriate descriptive commentary to the controller for steering,
   and the SP will take control of the aircraft with enough runway remaining to safely permit an
   abort or a takeoff should the need arise. After a touch-and-go takeoff, no attempt will be
   made to turn the aircraft until above 200 KIAS and above 200 feet AGL. Afterburner may be
   selected by the SP if desired.
   9.8.3. The controller will continue to fly the aircraft until positive transfer of control to the
   SP is assured.
   9.8.4. Do not attempt a captive full-stop landing without sufficient fuel for a go-around and
   subsequent pattern for full-stop landing prior to reaching minimum fuel.
9.9. Ordnance Release.
   9.9.1. The controller will initiate the request and receive clearance from the SP prior to
   ordnance release.
   9.9.2. Normal release/jettison will be performed using local procedures and applicable
   technical data.
   9.9.3. Emergency jettison may be accomplished in any clear area.
9.10. FCS pattern Rules of Engagement. Unless pre-coordinated otherwise, the SP and
controllers will ensure:
   9.10.1. 45 degrees of bank is not exceeded.
   9.10.2. 500 feet AGL minimum until on final.
   9.10.3. 185 KIAS minimum until on final.
   9.10.4. SP executes the go-around with throttle in MIL power NLT 3500 feet down.
   9.10.5. Wheels remain on runway.
   9.10.6. No hard landings.
   9.10.7. Surface winds are within the following limits prior to performing the event:
       9.10.7.1. Takeoff: 15 knots maximum crosswind, 20 knots maximum head/tailwind.
