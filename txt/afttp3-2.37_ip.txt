                                        PREFACE 

1.    Scope
     This multiservice publication is designed for chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear (CBRN) responders who plan and conduct CBRN consequence management (CM)
operations in domestic, foreign, or theater operational environments, to include military
installations. Department of Defense (DOD) personnel responding to a CBRN incident may
be responsible for CBRN CM and/or crisis planning and may be required to execute plans
across the conflict spectrum. This publication provides a reference for planning, resourcing,
and executing CBRN CM in support of domestic or foreign agencies responding to a CBRN
incident. Specific tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) are included in the appendixes.
This manual incorporates the joint doctrine elements from Joint Publication (JP) 3-40,
Joint Doctrine for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction; JP 3-41, Chemical, Biological,
Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosives Consequence Management; and JP 3-11,
Joint Doctrine for Operations in Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Environments, for
conducting CBRN CM (foreign and domestic), including planning, preparation, response,
and recovery considerations. During operations, this publication is subordinate to current
JPs addressing this topic.
2.    Purpose
      The purpose of this publication is to provide commanders, staffs, key agencies, and
military members with a key reference for planning and conducting CBRN CM. It provides
the tools for CBRN responders to effectively manage the consequences of a CBRN incident.
It also may serve as a reference for development and refining of training and exercises, but
shall not supersede Service policy.
3.    Application
     This publication is designed for use at the tactical level, but has implications at the
operational and strategic level for CBRN CM operations supporting strategic objectives.
The document will support command and staff planning in preparing for and conducting
CBRN CM operations. This manual focuses on DOD support to domestic or foreign CBRN
CM operations and a companion reference, Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures for Installation Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense,
addresses the CBRN defense response on a DOD installation.
This publication applies to the Active Army, the Army National Guard (ARNG)/Army
National Guard of the United States (ARNGUS), the United States Army Reserve (USAR)
unless otherwise stated and to the USMC.
4.    Implementation Plan
      Participating service command offices of primary responsibility (OPRs) will review
this publication, validate the information, and reference and incorporate it in service and
command manuals, regulations, and curricula as follows:
      Army. The United States Army (USA) will incorporate the procedures in this
publication in Army training and doctrinal publications as directed by the commander,
United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). Distribution is according
to the Department of the Army (DA) Form 12-99-R, (Initial Distribution (ID) Requirements
for Publications).

     Marine Corps. The United States Marine Corps (USMC) will incorporate the
procedures in this publication in USMC training and doctrinal publications as directed by
the Commanding General, Marine Corps Combat Development Command. Distribution is
according to the USMC publications distribution system.
     Navy. The United States Navy (USN) will incorporate procedures from this
publication where appropriate. Nothing in this publication will supersede existing Service-
specific policy on the conduct of Installation Emergency Management, Installation CBRN
Defense, Naval Security Forces, Installation Fire and Emergency Services, Defense Support
of Civil Authorities (DSCA), Foreign Consequence Management (FCM), or other relevant
mission areas and/or functional components.
      Air Force. The United States Air Force (USAF) will incorporate the procedures in
this publication in USAF training and doctrinal publications as directed by the Air Staff.
Distribution is according to the Department of the USAF Publications Distribution System.
5.   Summary of Change
     a.     This multiservice publication incorporates the CM guidance and framework
identified in JP 3-40 and JP 3-41. The guidance in these JPs did not exist when the
previous CM manual was written, thus there are significant differences between this
publication and the previous CM manual. Material that existed in the previous manual was
eliminated from this multiservice tactics, techniques, and procedures (MTTP), as
appropriate, when it appeared in JP 3-40 and JP 3-41 and did not serve the intended
audience. Due to the development of JP 3-40 and JP 3-41, higher-level guidance and
information now exists and this MTTP supports the implementation of guidance from the
new overarching doctrine publications.
      b.   The previous MTTP also discussed the CBRN aspects of CM as it related to the
Federal Response Plan (FRP), which was the current guidance at that time. This MTTP
provides information on the National Response Plan (NRP), which replaced the FRP in
December 2004. The NRP aligns federal coordination structures, capabilities, and resources
into a unified, all-discipline, and all-hazards approach to domestic incident management.
This manual now complies with the NRP, as appropriate.
      c.    The National Incident Management System (NIMS) is a comprehensive approach
to all aspects of incident management, regardless of size, complexity, or cause. The
guidance for NIMS was published by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in
March 2004 and continues to be refined and updated by the NIMS Integration Center. One
of the six primary elements of NIMS is the use of a standardized command and
management system for incident scene operations, termed the Incident Command System
(ICS), and for supporting operations centers (OCs), termed the Multiagency Coordination
System. In addition, NIMS prescribes specific standards regarding all aspects of
preparedness, including planning, training, certification, equipment, and information
systems. DOD guidance embraces NIMS, and this manual adopts NIMS whenever
applicable.
     d.  This manual also incorporates updated information concerning mass casualty
decontamination (MCD) operations that was not previously available.

           ASPECTS OF CONSEQUENCE MANAGEMENT 


1.   Background
     The focus of this manual is the tactical operational CBRN CM activities for all
deliberate and inadvertent releases of CBRN material.
     a.     Incidents involving CBRN material produce a chaotic and hazardous
environment requiring immediate response to minimize pain and suffering, reduce
casualties, and restore essential infrastructure. Responders at the local, state, and federal
levels may be overwhelmed by the magnitude of the incident, and United States (U.S.) DOD
forces may be requested to provide additional support through the NRP. The following is a
historical example of the type of support that DOD may provide during an incident.
            (1) Situation. In the fall of 2001, letters containing anthrax spores were mailed
to U.S. news media personnel and congressional officials. These letters precipitated the first
cases of infection related to an intentional release of anthrax in the United States.
Outbreaks of the disease were concentrated in six epicenters where individuals came into
contact with spores from contaminated letters. The epicenters were Florida; New York;
New Jersey; Connecticut; Capitol Hill in Washington, District of Columbia (D.C.); and the
Washington, D.C., regional area, which includes Maryland and Virginia.
            (2) Impact. The anthrax incidents caused illness in 22 people—11 with the
cutaneous (skin) form and 11 with the inhalational (respiratory) form. Five people died
from anthrax inhalation. Beyond the epicenters, there was also a psychological impact on
the rest of the country, which caused people to be wary of suspicious mail. This wariness
triggered additional reports of possible anthrax incidents, which later turned out to be false
alarms.
            (3) Support. Upon request, DOD provided military response assets to support
CM operations on Capitol Hill. Military assets collected suspect samples while operating in
Level A protection and conducted technical decontamination of their team and other
response workers. Military CBRN responders also received the mission to remove
contaminated mail from the P Street postal facility in Washington, D.C. Refer to Multiservice
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Protection for a
description of the civilian levels of protection.
     b.    In order to synchronize DOD support to CM operations, units must understand
the NRP emergency support functions (ESFs). ESFs detail the missions, policies,
structures, and responsibilities of federal agencies for coordinating resources and support
during incidents of national significance. The ESFs are defined as—
      •        ESF #1 – Transportation.
      •        ESF #2 – Communications.
      •        ESF #3 – Public Works and Engineering.
      •        ESF #4 – Firefighting.
      •        ESF #5 – Emergency Management.

      •   ESF #6 – Mass Care, Housing, and Human Services.
      •   ESF #7 – Resource Support.
      •   ESF #8 – Public Health and Medical Services.
      •   ESF #9 – Urban Search and Rescue.
      •   ESF #10 – Oil and Hazardous Materials Response.
      •   ESF #11 – Agriculture and Natural Resources.
      •   ESF #12 – Energy.
      •   ESF #13 – Public Safety and Security.
      •   ESF #14 – Long-Term Community Recovery and Mitigation.
      •   ESF #15 – External Affairs.
     c.    This publication provides tactical CM doctrine that incorporates appropriate
national and military strategies, policy, joint doctrine (such as JP 3-41), and the NRP (when
applicable).
     d.    This chapter provides terms of reference used throughout the manual, a
description of the operational environments in which CBRN CM is conducted, and an
overview of the factors that govern response support. Chapters I through V provide the
principle-based doctrine, while Appendixes A through D provide the supporting TTP that
evolve based on capability enhancements and/or lessons learned.
2.    Terms of Reference
      This section provides definitions for key terms used throughout this manual. Other
less common term definitions may be found in the Glossary.
     a.    Consequence Management. Actions taken to maintain or restore essential
services and manage and mitigate problems resulting from disasters and catastrophes,
including natural, manmade, or terrorist incidents. Also called CM. (JP 1-02) Figure I-1
depicts the common hazard groups that may require CM operations.
      b.   Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosives [CBRNE]
Hazards. Those chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosive
elements that pose or could pose a hazard to individuals. Chemical, biological, radiological,
nuclear, and high-yield explosive hazards include those created from accidental releases,
toxic industrial materials (TIM) (especially air and water poisons), biological pathogens,
radioactive matter, and high-yield explosives. Also included are any hazards resulting from
the deliberate employment of weapons of mass destruction [WMD] during military
operations. Also called CBRNE hazards. (JP 1-02) Figure I-2, page I-4, depicts the CBRN
hazards that may require CM operations and provide the focus for this manual.
NOTE: This manual does not address high-yield explosives which are covered in
JP 3-41 and Service-specific doctrine.
     c.    Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, or High-Yield Explosives Incidents.
An emergency resulting from the deliberate or unintentional release of nuclear, biological,
radiological, or toxic or poisonous chemical materials, or the detonation of a high-yield
explosive. Also called CBRNE incidents. (JP 1-02)

                            Figure I-1. Consequence Management Hazards
     d.    Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosives
Consequence Management. The consequence management activities for all deliberate and
inadvertent releases of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosives
that are undertaken when directed or authorized by the President of the United States.
Also called CBRNE CM. (JP 1-02)
      e. Weapons of Mass Destruction. Weapons that are capable of a high order of
destruction and/or of being used in such a manner as to destroy large numbers of people.
WMD can be high-yield explosives or nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological
weapons, but exclude the means of transporting or propelling the weapon where such
means is a separable and divisible part of the weapon. Also called WMD.
(JP 1-02) Other definitions of WMD can be found in Title 18 United States Code (USC)
2332a, 50 USC 2302, and the NRP.
      f.   Immediate Response Authority. Any form of action taken by the DOD component
or military commander to assist civil authorities or the public to save lives, prevent human
suffering, or mitigate great property damage under imminently serious conditions when
there is insufficient time to obtain approval from the chain of command. (DOD Instruction
[DODI] 2000.18)
     g.    First Responder. Local and nongovernmental police, fire, and emergency
personnel who, in the early stages of an incident, are responsible for the protection and
preservation of life, property, evidence, and the environment, including emergency response
providers as defined in Section 2 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as well as
emergency management, public health, clinical care, public works, and other skilled
support personnel (such as equipment operators) who provide immediate support services

3.    Goals
    Goals help focus how DOD conducts CBRN CM. They provide a common
understanding of the purpose of CBRN CM.
     a.    JP 3-41 states, “the primary goals of CBRNE CM are to save lives; prevent
injury; provide temporary critical life support; protect critical infrastructure, property, and
the environment; restore essential operations; contain the event; and preserve national
security.” Figure I-3 illustrates the CBRN CM goals.



                                            Save lives



                                                               Protect critical
                                                                  property,
                     Contain the event                       infrastructure, and
                                                              the environment

                                                                     Preserve

                      Figure I-3. CBRN Consequence Management Goals
     b. The CBRN defense principles of contamination avoidance, protection, and
decontamination support these same goals. For example—
          (1)   Saving Lives. Saving lives is the greatest priority during CM operations.
This includes immediate life-saving measures given by first responders; life-sustaining
techniques, such as emergency decontamination and MCD; and prophylaxis to ensure long-
term casualty care, treatment, and safety.
          (2)   Preventing Injury. Protection-related measures help prevent or mitigate
exposure to hazards that cause injury or illness. These measures include setting up a
security perimeter and establishing hazard control zones.
         (3)    Providing Temporary Critical Life Support. Response-related measures are
conducted to assist civil authorities in the provision of medical services to injured
personnel.



1 April 2008     FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                        I-5
          (4)    Protecting Critical Infrastructure, Property, and the Environment. The
protection of critical infrastructure, property, and the environment occurs through the
rapid application of decontamination efforts, early warning and reporting of incidents, and
protection of key personnel. Command decisions to shelter in place (SIP) or evacuate also
support the protection of resources.
        (5)     Restoring Essential Operations. Following a CBRN event, a likely
consequence is the loss of one or more essential services or operations. Rapid restoration of
power, water, communication nodes, and transportation routes accompanied by
decontamination efforts are vital to continuing critical command missions.
          (6)    Containing the Event. Controlling access to an incident site and conducting
proper decontamination procedures limits the spread of contamination. Establishing hazard
control zones (cold, warm, and hot zones) helps to ensure safe work areas for emergency
responders and supporting resources.
          (7)    Preserving National Security. CBRN defense principles contribute to the
preservation of national security by protecting critical infrastructure within the United
States or other locations. When U.S. forces are prepared to respond to an incident, it
supports the larger strategic goal of preserving national security. For installation-specific
CBRN defense principles, refer to Multiservice Tactics, Techniques and Procedures for
Installation Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense.
4.    Operational Environments
      CBRN CM operations occur in foreign and domestic settings. DOD must be prepared
to conduct CBRN CM operations whenever called upon.
      a.   An operational environment is a composite of the conditions, circumstances, and
influences that affect the employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the
commander. DOD conducts CM operations in three types of operational environments.
           (1) Defense Support of Civil Authorities During a Domestic Response. This
response includes assisting federal agencies within the United States, territories, and
possessions according to guidance in the NRP. DOD supports operations within its
capabilities through liaison with the incident commander (IC).
            (2) Defense Support to a Foreign Request. DOD supports the Department of
State (DOS) with operations originating from a foreign request. Tasks originate from the
host nation (HN) through the DOS. However, DOD commanders may take appropriate
action in life-threatening situations while awaiting DOD or DOS tasking.
          (3) DOD-Led Operations. DOD leads the operational response for an incident
involving U.S. forces and allies across the range of military operations. This also includes
responding on a DOD installation. See JP 3-41 for more information on DOD-led
operations.
     b.    DOD forces tasked to support civil authorities during domestic consequence
management (DCM) and FCM operations will use the level of protection as determined by
the IC. However, in a DOD-led CM response, the senior DOD official will make risk-based
decisions, to include decisions on the level of protection.
     c.    A DCM response will normally be led by the DHS, and the DOS will normally
lead a foreign response. In the first two environments, DOD will normally operate in



I-6              FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37               1 April 2008
support of the DHS or the DOS. However, DOD will likely have full control in the third
operational environment. In each of the three response elements, DOD retains C2 of all
DOD assets.
5.    Tasks
     CBRN CM tasks are conducted during the operations process. A graphical
representation of the CBRN CM tasks is in Figure I-4, page I-8. The components are listed
below.
      a.   Assess the Situation. Response units continually collect and analyze information
before, during, and after each mission to enable the confirmation, correction, or refutation
of existing analyses. Assessment activities provide the ability to predict future
requirements in order to make necessary planning and operational adjustments.
Assessment activities include threat, readiness, plans and TTP, detection and analysis, and
surveillance. At the tactical level, the response element (a decontamination or survey team)
assesses information on the hazard (agent flammability, reactivity, explosiveness, and
physical properties; protective clothing requirements; weather information; and site
drawings).
     b.    Coordinate Operations. Response units coordinate the full range of activities
across the spectrum of the mission. Coordination activities include exercise; warning and
reporting; C2 and synchronization; security and control; forensics; sample collection and
packaging; and public and civil affairs activities. At the tactical level, the response element
(the CBRN survey team) conducts coordination within the military task force (or with other
supporting activities) to coordinate link-up times and locations for staging area operations
or operational updates. Responding units report to the incident command post (ICP) and
are assigned tasks according to its level of training and incident requirements.
     c.   Conduct Logistics. Response units plan and conduct the movement and
sustainment of forces for CBRN CM operations. Logistic activities that may be conducted
by response elements include prepositioning materials; transporting casualties, remains,
and samples; deploying personnel and material; and maintaining facilities and material.
     d.    Provide Health Service Support. Response units provide HSS during CBRN CM
operations. HSS addresses services performed, provided, or arranged to promote, improve,
conserve, or restore the mental or physical well-being of personnel. These services include,
but are not limited to, the management of health services resources, such as manpower,
monies, and facilities; preventive and curative health measures; evacuation of the wounded,
injured, or sick; selection of the medically fit and disposition of the medically unfit; blood
management; medical supplies and equipment and maintenance thereof; combat stress
control; and medical, dental, veterinary, laboratory, optometric, nutrition therapy, and
medical intelligence services. The term force health protection (FHP) will be used,
according to JP 1-02, whenever the following definition applies: measures to promote,
improve, or conserve the mental and physical well-being of military members. These
measures enable a healthy and fit force, prevent injury and illness, and protect the force
from health hazards.
     e.    Decontaminate. Response units remove contamination from personnel,
equipment, and facilities. Decontamination activities include emergency, responder, mass
casualty, and patient decontamination.

                  Figure I-4. CBRN Consequence Management Tasks Pillar
6. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Consequence Management
Process
     The operations process consists of four primary activities—plan, prepare, execute, and
continually assess. CBRN CM follows this model. Within the CBRN CM process, the
execution activity is further expanded into two subordinate activities—response and
recovery. This expansion is necessary to address the graduated level of effort from
immediate actions to full restoration (see Figure I-5). Assessments are continuous
throughout preincident and postincident activities. The planning and preparation activities
support the NRP prevention efforts, while the response and recovery actions support the
NRP mitigation efforts. The chapters and appendixes that follow provide doctrine and
supporting TTP for these CBRN CM activities.
      a.    Plan. Planning involves the assessment of the operational environment and
enables commanders to identify minimum standards for training, organizing, equipping,
and protecting resources. The response unit’s planning process determines preparation and
facilitates response and recovery operations. Chapter II and Appendix A discuss the
planning process in more detail.
     b.    Prepare. Preparation implements the approved plan and relevant agreements to
increase readiness through training, exercises, and certification. Vulnerability reduction
measures are initiated by the response unit to support prevention and mitigation functions.
Chapter III and Appendix B discuss the preparation process in more detail.
     c.    Respond. The response process addresses the short-term, direct effects of an
incident. Response measures initiated by the response unit include those actions taken to

save lives, protect property, and establish control. Chapter IV and Appendix C discuss the
response process in more detail.
     d.    Recover. The response unit initiates the recovery process, focusing on restoring
mission capability and essential public and government services interrupted by the
incident. The recovery phase also includes completing the mitigation of the immediate
hazard. Chapter V and Appendix D discuss the recovery process in more detail.

7.    Joint Operational Phases for Consequence Management
     During domestic or foreign response operations, response elements follow a
multiphase operational approach that is similar to the approach taken for other military
deployment operations. The operational phases parallel the operations process as the
CBRN CM objectives unfold. This parallel relationship is depicted in Figure I-6, page I-10.
The operational phases are listed below.
     a.    Alert, Preparation, and Situation Assessment. Response elements take actions
such as alerting unit personnel, assessing the incident, preparing for deployment, and the
advanced echelon (ADVON) traveling to the incident site.
     b.   Deployment. Upon receipt of the appropriate directive, the unit moves to the
designated location within the time frame specified.
   c.    Support to U.S., Civil, or HN Authorities. Response elements (remaining under
DOD C2) support coordinated actions to accomplish the CM goals.
     d.    Transition. This phase outlines the remaining tasks for the response element to
complete prior to redeployment, following coordination between the DOD C2 element and
the applicable HN or domestic authority.

     e.    Redeployment. The response unit begins redeployment when directed. This
phase is complete when the unit has reached its designated home station.

                                      PLANNING 


1.    Planning Overview
     Planning is an integral part of CBRN CM. A CBRN CM plan is a living document
which must be maintained and updated as changes occur.
     a.    CBRN CM Mission. Response units begin planning for CBRN CM operations
when they receive a mission from its headquarters to conduct or support CM operations.
See Figure II-1 for the planning phase relative to the other phases of the CBRN CM
process. A unit may determine if it must be prepared to support or conduct CM operations
by analyzing its given mission and conducting a mission-to-task analysis. The mission-to­
task analysis may identify one of the unit’s tasks as “Conduct CBRN Consequence
Management Operations” or “Support CBRN Consequence Management Operations.”




                Figure II-1. CBRN Consequence Management Process (Plan)

      b. The CBRN CM Plan. The supporting response unit’s plan can be an operation
plan (OPLAN) or a contingency plan which can be converted to an operation order (OPORD)
to execute or support operations. Appendix A provides further details on plan development
and an example of a plan.
      c. CBRN CM Planning. Planning involves conducting assessments of the
operational environment (including the threat), vulnerabilities, capabilities, and risk.
Additionally, war gaming is conducted for scenarios that address deliberate site
assessments for known locations. Response unit planning is conducted like other military


1 April 2008    FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                    II-1
mission planning. The unit uses whatever method it normally uses to plan its missions.
One such method is called the military decision-making process. This process consists of—
       •    Mission receipt.
       •    Mission analysis.
       •    Course of action (COA) development.
       •    COA analysis.
       •    COA comparison.
       •    COA approval.
       •    Order production.
       d.   There are two levels of planning that occur—contingency and crisis action.
            (1) Contingency planning includes those Joint Operation Planning and
Execution System (JOPES) planning activities that occur in noncrisis situations. The joint
planning and execution community uses contingency planning to develop OPLANs for a
broad range of contingencies. OPLANs are based on requirements identified in the
Contingency Planning Guidance, Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan, or other planning
directives. Contingency planning underpins and facilitates the transition to crisis action
planning (CAP).
           (2) CAP is a JOPES process involving the time-sensitive development of joint
OPLANs and OPORDs for the deployment, employment, and sustainment of assigned and
allocated forces and resources in response to an imminent crisis. CAP is based on the actual
circumstances that exist at the time planning occurs.
2.     Operational Environment Assessment
     An operational environment assessment provides the response unit commander
information on the threat, the physical environment, and the political environment.
Decision support tools may be used in conjunction with this information to assist predictive
modeling. Decision support tools may be in the hands of the response unit or obtained by
the unit using reachback capabilities or a capability available at the incident site.
       a.   Threat.
           (1) The threat assessment identifies what the response unit will face during a
CM operation. At the tactical level, the threat assessment is provided by the applicable
military C2 element. The threat assessment addresses the types of agents and hazards at
an incident site and includes occupational and environmental health (OEH) assessments.
Additionally, the response unit receives information on potential CBRN storage or
production facilities in the vicinity and the methods used to deliver or release CBRN agents
or materials. Estimates may be furnished regarding when, where, and how agents or
materials may be used. Higher headquarters guidance provides information on previous
incidents (past use) and the current threat level as established at the incident site.
            (2) The CBRN response unit (or element) receives situation reports (SITREPs),
intelligence summary reports, and spot reports, which provide information to update the
commander’s situational awareness (SA) and common operational picture (COP).
Information sharing between civil and military law enforcement agencies provides a means
to track local civil threats.

NOTE: Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Installation
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense provides procedures for
conducting a CBRN threat analysis or assessment.
     b.    Physical Environment. The physical environment includes terrain, weather, and
characteristics of the geographical area that impact the CM response. Characteristics
include critical infrastructure, hazard sites, and zone analysis considerations.
            (1) Critical Infrastructure. The response unit reviews the critical infrastructure
in the vicinity of the incident site. The presence (or absence) of the following critical
infrastructure impacts the operations at an incident site:
               (a) Telecommunications. The availability of networks and systems that
support the transmission and exchange of electronic communications among and between
end-users (such as networked computers) directly impacts operations such as technical
reachback.
                (b) Electrical Power. The availability of generation stations and
transmission and distribution networks that create and supply electricity to response teams
impacts the logistic support required.
                (c) Chemical, Nuclear Power, Gas, and Oil Production, Storage, and
Delivery. The holding, refining, and processing facilities for these fuels and the pipelines,
ships, trucks, and rail systems that transport them could be potential targets.
                 (d) Transportation. The aviation, rail, highway and aquatic vehicles,
conduits, and support systems by which hazardous material (HAZMAT) is moved from a
point-of-origin to a destination point could be targets; its availability directly impacts
logistic support.
                 (e) Water Supply Systems. The sources of water, reservoirs and holding
facilities, aqueducts and other transport systems, filtration and cleaning systems, pipelines,
cooling systems, sewage treatment plants, and other delivery mechanisms that provide for
domestic and industrial applications—including systems dealing with decontamination—
could be targets. Availability of an adequate water supply system impacts logistic support
and decontamination operations.
               (f)  Emergency Services. Local, state, or federal medical, police, fire, and
rescue system capabilities provide resources that military response assets will augment.
           (2) Hazard Sites. Known or suspected WMD and TIM production, storage,
research, or related facilities must be considered potential sources for CBRN hazard
release. This is an especially critical aspect to the targeting process. These facilities must be
identified and prioritized on WMD or TIM master site lists and maintained with other
target folders.
          (3) Zone Analysis. The response unit receives a zone analysis of the vicinity of
the CBRN CM incident site. The zoning procedure essentially divides an urban area into
zones according to the major categories of building occupancy or function. The zoning
information can be presented in the form of an annotated map or color-coded overlay.
Typical zones include—
               •   Residential.
               •   Commercial.

            •   Industrial.
            •   Transportation.
            •   Storage.
            •   Military.
       c.   Political Environment.
           (1) For support of domestic operations, the response unit receives information
on agreements (memorandums of understanding [MOUs] and memorandums of agreement
[MOAs]) that are in place to support operations. For example, contracted logistic support
(CLS) may be available at the incident site (via an MOA) to provide logistic support, or
other agreements may be in place to provide other needed capabilities (such as water
resupply).
           (2) For support of foreign CBRN CM operations, the response unit is advised of
applicable HN agreements, status-of-forces agreements, and other sovereignty issues that
may apply.
           (3) Installation 10 USC assets receive tasks to provide support to validated
requests for assistance (RFAs). Installation resources capable of providing the necessary
response are then sent to a CM incident area to perform the tasks, with operational control
(OPCON) normally assigned to the defense coordinating officer (DCO) or joint task force
(JTF) during a CBRN incident. The DCO is the DOD on-scene representative who
coordinates DSCA requirements for the supporting response units with the IC or
designated representative.
           (4) The 32 USC support resources, such as installation-based Army National
Guard (ARNG) units, remain under the control of the governor through The Adjutant
General. However, ARNG units assigned to an installation could operate (on or off the
installation) within its state of assignment or within another state to support a CBRN CM
incident under one of four potential authorities (see Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures for Installation Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense for
further information). Potential authorities are—
            •   Immediate response.
            •   Interstate compacts.
            •   State-to-state MOAs.
            •   Mobilization under 10 USC.
3.     Capabilities Assessment
     A capabilities assessment is conducted during CBRN CM planning. It provides a
candid picture of DOD’s ability to conduct CBRN CM.
      a.    The capabilities assessment is a tool used by the commander to gauge the unit’s
ability to conduct or support CBRN CM operations. It involves the continuous assessment
of a unit’s plans, organization, manpower, equipment, logistics, training, leadership, and
readiness. See Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3110.16A, Military
Capabilities, Assets, and Units for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High
Yield Explosive Consequence Management Operations, for information on response unit
CBRN CM capabilities and Appendix A for further information.

      b.    Prior to a CBRN CM incident, military organizations and activities identified to
conduct, augment, or manage CM operations assess its readiness posture to determine its
ability to perform the full range of CM tasks. The commander considers the capabilities
required to execute the missions and their ability to integrate CBRN CM tasks.

ensuring that information contained in the database is interoperable with relevant
interagency and HN entities.
4.    Vulnerability Assessment
    A vulnerability assessment (VA) is a key part of CBRN CM planning. It allows
commanders to take a holistic look at the organization’s strengths and weaknesses
compared to the operational environment and CBRN threat.
      a.   Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Installation Chemical,
Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense can be used to conduct the assessment of a
unit’s capabilities and readiness. The process examines—
      •        Unit terrorism CM plans and terrorist incident response measures.
      •    Capabilities of the military unit or activity to support its core competencies such
as emergency operations and response. These include fire or medical capabilities; mass
casualty, technical, or emergency decontamination; EOD; HAZMAT; mass notification;
emergency operations center (EOC) operations; and incident response operations. This
includes an assessment of its training and resources.
      •        Unit advisory or assistance support.
      •        The adequacy of deployment procedures to support operations.
     b.   The VA includes the other types of assessments discussed into an overall
snapshot of a unit’s ability to support or conduct an operation given the operational
environment and the unit’s capabilities (see Figure II-2, page II-8).
     c.   The VA identifies weaknesses in the unit and its plan(s) and develops (or
recommends) vulnerability reduction measures to counter these identified weaknesses.
Vulnerability reduction measures will be discussed in Chapter III.
      d.   Developing a VA plan requires comparison of the threat with a unit’s
vulnerabilities to determine the efforts necessary to safely meet incident requirements. The
VA also includes the integration of the commander’s guidance through a composite risk
management (CRM) process in order to prioritize vulnerability reduction measure
implementation. During the planning phase, the VA begins with the identification of the
hazards and an analysis of each. VA during the planning phase continues by integrating
the specific threat assessment with analysis of specific vulnerabilities and identification of
potential vulnerability reduction measures. The end-state during the planning phase is
typically an estimate and recommendation to the commander on the priorities for
vulnerability reduction.

                 Guidance


                         Figure II-2. Vulnerability Assessment Cycle
5.     Risk Assessment
      Commanders conduct risk assessments during CBRN CM planning to quantify the
level of risk that may exist in the conduct of CBRN.
      a.   The response unit identifies and assesses the risks associated with its assigned
missions and makes decisions that balance the costs of those risks with mission benefits. In
certain incidents (such as high radiation hazards) the risk may not be acceptable.
      b.   Commanders must be cognizant of their operational environment. Acceptable
risks associated with wartime may not be acceptable when conducting a CM operation. An
example can be found in the differences in guidance for radiation exposure for military
personnel during war and civilian first responders in a domestic environment. Generally, a
higher level of risk is accepted during a wartime situation than would be acceptable under
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards for radiation exposures
in a domestic environment. It is expected that DOD forces operating in a DCM environment
will be held to the same standards as their civilian counterparts.
6.     Deliberate Site Assessments
     Deliberate site assessment allows commanders to better recognize and identify
potential CBRN hazards within their area of operation (AO). This allows units to be
prepared to execute CBRN CM operations against potential existing sites, if needed.
     a.    Prior to an incident, a response unit conducts deliberate assessments of sites
within its AO that may pose a potential hazard in the future. The following examples are
provided for clarification—
          (1) U.S. forces supporting implementation force operations in Tuzla, Bosnia,
supported an HN effort to conduct a deliberate site assessment of CBRN hazards at the
Sudaso Chemical Factory. This factory, within the United States AO, was reported to



II-8            FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                 1 April 2008
possess large rail containers filled with chlorine and other hazardous chemicals. The
deliberate site assessment hazard analysis indicated that large amounts of chlorine or other
hazardous chemicals released into the environment (air and water supply) could seriously
affect the local population. Using information gathered by CBRN reconnaissance personnel
during these site assessments, the unit was better able to plan for a potential CM response.
           (2) U.S. CBRN military units supporting a DHS national CM exercise in 2004
conducted deliberate site assessments of TIM locations. Using information collected during
these site assessments, the units were better able to plan for a potential CM response.
      b.   Units conduct deliberate site assessments as part of the intelligence preparation
of the operational environment (IPOE) and prepare “potential threat folders” for each site
assessed. They use these folders to strategize how they would respond if an incident
occurred at these sites and to prepare tentative response plans for each. Pertinent
information collected by the units for each potential threat is maintained in the folder for
use in a future response. Information could include floor plans, site maps, routes in and out,
potential staging areas, and a determination of prevailing winds to produce downwind
hazard predictions. While there is no standard format for these potential threat folders,
suggested content is provided in Table II-1.

           Building plans

            (1) It is critical to gather as much information and intelligence as possible on
the site. It is probable that extensive information will be available on most sites.
          (2) Background information on the site will be critical for detailed planning.
Imagery, maps, and site sketches will assist in the planning.
          (3) The site assessment identifies sample information such as the types of
CBRN agents or material that may be present, the organization of the facility, and the
number of people who typically work at the site.
        c.     Mission Planning Considerations.
           (1) CBRN response units identify specified and implied mission tasks. Specified
tasks are those directly stated in the mission order that specifically outline what is to be



1 April 2008        FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                                    II-9
accomplished by the mission. Implied tasks are the necessary tasks that will be executed by
the team to accomplish the specified tasks (see Table II-2).
           (2) Using the information collected, the response unit determines what primary
missions can be accomplished from within its capabilities. Primary and secondary mission
objectives should be clearly outlined.
           (3) Using the essential elements of information (EEI) list, the unit generates
requests for information (RFIs). Sample EEIs are identified in Table II-3.

                                    PREPARATION 


1.    Background
      a.   During the preparation phase, response units conduct systematic vulnerability
reduction measures. The accomplishment of these measures supports unit readiness to
undertake assigned missions. This chapter focuses on means of determining the
requirements and developing the capabilities to implement the planning for conducting
high-priority vulnerability reduction measures. See Figure III-1 for the preparation phase
in relation to the other phases of the CBRN CM process.




               Figure III-1. CBRN Consequence Management Process (Prepare)
      b.   Response units undertake concurrent actions to maintain its readiness as part of
a continuous cyclic process. The concurrent unit vulnerability reduction measures include
assessment, planning, training and education, and exercises. Appendix B provides further
detail on vulnerability reduction measures that can assist a unit in preparing for an
operation.
      c.    The response unit also undertakes measures to integrate its preparation
activities with other supporting and supported assets. Representative action areas include
coordination, logistics, and HSS.
     d.    Exercises serve as a gauge for the commander to reassess capabilities and
identify remaining vulnerabilities that impact mission execution. Exercises provide an
opportunity to test plans and make refinements as necessary.

      e. The material in this chapter addresses procedures for preparing and sustaining a
unit’s CM capabilities
NOTE: Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological,
and Chemical Vulnerability Assessment provides generic CBRN vulnerability
reduction measures that can be adapted when planning and preparing
operations.
2.      Vulnerability Reduction Measures
        a.   CBRN CM Unit Logistics.
           (1) The response unit possesses an organic logistic capability to support the
following basic functions:
             •   Sustain the unit’s ability to conduct operations.
             •   Maintain logistic status reports.
             •   Coordinate with supporting logistic providers.
             •   Procure and store unit equipment according to command guidance.
            (2) A response unit deploys with adequate stocks to sustain operations for a
limited duration. To sustain extended operations, a deployed unit receives additional
logistical and personnel augmentation.
          (3) The logistic posture for a response unit includes military standard
equipment (mission-oriented protective posture [MOPP] gear) or DOD-approved
commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment (civilian protective ensembles). During the
preparation phase, the response unit identifies the supporting logistic requirements to
sustain operations.
NOTE: Throughout the rest of this manual, military standard gear or MOPP gear
will be referred to as individual protective equipment (IPE) and civilian COTS
protective ensembles, or “nonstandard equipment sets,” will be referred to as
PPE.
           (4) The military standard issue of CBRN detection, protection, and
decontamination equipment provides units with the ability to detect and protect against a
number of CBRN agents. However, standard issue items such as the M40A1 mask are
technically noncompliant with OSHA and National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health (NIOSH) standards and may not be used during nonmilitary operations such as
DCM. It is important to note that not every unit or installation will possess all equipment
items. Standard issue equipment can be referenced in the following:
         •     CBRN detection and protection equipment—Multiservice Tactics,
Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Protection.
          •     CBRN decontamination equipment—Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Decontamination.
         •     CBRN monitoring and surveillance equipment—Multiservice Tactics,
Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear Biological and Chemical Reconnaissance.
         •     Biological detection and surveillance equipment—Multiservice Tactics,
Techniques, and Procedures for Biological Surveillance.


III-2             FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37            1 April 2008
           (5) Nonstandard equipment sets provide units with additional capabilities,
such as the ability to detect many substances and chemicals that are immediately
dangerous to life or health. CBRN CM response forces may be required to maintain PPE
sets that provide greater protection than those commonly provided for military protection
against chemical warfare (CW) and biological warfare (BW). In a DCM environment, DOD
forces tasked to support civil authorities in downrange operations shall meet the training,
equipment, and proficiency standards for such operations as determined by federal law and
policy. Standards may be found in 29 CFR 1910.120 and applicable guidance for the
interagency board and other federally recognized policy boards or documents. Additionally,
equipment that is capable of detecting a greater range of substances is required to identify
TIM and organic substances in addition to CW and BW agents.
         (6) Other logistic considerations include personnel support measures that are
needed while deployed to an incident site. These considerations include the following:
               •     Billeting.
               •     Rations.
               •     Transportation support.
               •     Security.
      b.       CBRN CM Response Unit Personnel.
           (1) Response unit leaders identify the duties and responsibilities for each
position in their unit. Checklists should be prepared to identify the individual and collective
tasks that require completion.
            (2) During this preparation phase, leaders are aware of the requirements that
each unit member must fulfill (such as periodic medical examinations and scheduled
certification training).
               (3)   Personnel shortages are also identified periodically through readiness
reporting.
3. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Consequence Management
Education and Training
      a.   Education. Response unit organizations and personnel at all levels must be
appropriately educated to provide an effective all-hazards CM capability. CBRN CM
operations need to be adequately emphasized in applicable programs of instruction. For
those units without experience in civilian exercises on a local, state, regional, or national
basis, limited opportunities exist to incorporate lessons learned from these events into
institutional education, simulations, and exercises. All personnel should be educated in
basic CBRN awareness. Personnel assigned special responsibilities should receive more
specific operational instruction. Numerous courses and training opportunities are available
from various government and private sources. A compendium of these resources is available
from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and can be found at
<http://training.fema.gov/IS/>. Important educational opportunities are available in the
following areas:




1 April 2008         FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                     III-3
          (1)   General Awareness.
                (a) Protection/Antiterrorism. One component of combating terrorism
includes defensive measures against terrorist attacks. All personnel train on the
fundamentals necessary to defend against terrorist attacks.
                (b) Overview of CBRN Counterterrorism Operations. Based on the roles
and responsibilities of the audience, this may include the fundamentals of the NRP, the
ICS, and Service-specific issues.
          (2)   Specific Operational Education. Command and Staff—
                •    The role of the senior action agency, such as DHS or DOS.
                •    Legal authorities, constraints, and limitations.
                •    Logistic and support requirements, including fiscal reimbursement
issues.
                •    C2 structures.
NOTE: The DOD Emergency Preparedness Course is an example of this type of
training. This course prepares emergency preparedness liaison officers (EPLOs)
and staffs to plan and execute joint military operations that support civil
authorities responding to domestic emergencies and disasters. The United States
Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) offers the course eight times a year at the
FEMA Mount Weather Emergency Assistance Center, Berryville, Virginia, and
conducts training within the United States Pacific Command and United States
Southern Command areas of responsibility (AORs) each year. This training is
authorized by DOD Directive (DODD) 3025.1, Military Support to Civil Authorities
(MSCA).
     b.   Training. Response units train to perform individual and collective CBRN CM
tasks as units and joint forces. Licensing and certification standards vary, based on the
geographical location and the equipment available to each unit. Unit leaders ensure that all
operators are fully trained to complete their assigned missions.
           (1) Training Tasks. Response units conduct training on key Universal Joint
Task List (UJTL) and applicable Service-specific training tasks that support preparedness
and response and recovery measures. Using the UJTL as a baseline helps to support a
common framework for training.
           (2) Training Conditions. Response units use a simulated hazardous
environment as a condition for selected training events. The degradation experienced by
operating in the appropriate protective posture provides a level of realism that improves
unit preparedness. This type of training provides unit leadership with an assessment of the
effectiveness of vulnerability reduction measures.
           (3) General Training Considerations. CBRN awareness training is available for
every military member, DOD civilian, contractor, appropriate Family member, and local
national hired by DOD—regardless of rank. These personnel should be aware of CBRN
actions and effects, the need to maintain vigilance for possible CBRN actions, and methods
for employment of CBRN TTP. To ensure an effective CM response, a cross-functional
training program should be implemented. Thorough training is required to prepare




III-4           FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37             1 April 2008
individuals and response teams to safely and efficiently respond to a terrorist CBRN attack
at their required level of proficiency.
               (4)   Incident Management System Training.
                (a) General Considerations. Response units must have personnel trained
to respond to a CBRN attack. Personnel participating in the incident response should be
trained to competently perform within the ICS/unified command (UC) structure. Incident
management system training focuses on DCM operations.
NOTE: Numbered courses with the prefixes IS and ICS are available from FEMA’s
Emergency Management Institute.
               (b) Minimum Requirements. The following are minimum requirements
for personnel who will fulfill an incident management role:
                 •    Response unit entry-level responders (including firefighters, security
personnel, emergency medical services [EMS] providers, and other emergency personnel)
will require an introduction to the basic components of the ICS. Entry-level courses include
IS-700, National Incident Management System (Introduction); IS-800.A, National Response
Plan (NRP) (An Introduction); IS-100, Introduction to Incident Command System; and the
Tri-Service Emergency Management Program Response Course.
                •   Response unit first-line supervisors, single-resource leaders, field
supervisors, company officers, entry-level personnel (trainees) on incident management
teams, and other emergency personnel will require a higher level of ICS training (IS-700;
ICS-100; and ICS-200, ICS [Incident Command System] for Single Resources and Initial
Action Incidents).
                 •    Strike team leaders, task force leaders, unit leaders, and EOC staff
also require higher-level ICS training (IS-700; IS-800; ICS-100; ICS-200; and ICS-300,
Intermediate ICS for Expanding Incidents for Operational First Responders).
                •     Command and general staff, agency administrators, department
heads, emergency managers, area commanders, and multiagency coordination system/EOC
managers also require higher-level ICS training (IS-700; IS-800; ICS-100; ICS-200; ICS­
300; and ICS-400, Advance ICS for Command and General Staff, Complex Incident, MACS
for Operational First Responders).
                 •    All personnel providing support to civil authorities must complete
IS-800 prior to providing support.
            (5) CBRN Responder Training. CBRN responders are DOD military and
civilians trained and certified to operate safely from the awareness through technician
response levels.
                     (a)   General Considerations.
               •    All local responding personnel must be trained at least to the
responder operations level.
                 •    Persons functioning in more complex roles, such as the IC, HAZMAT
team leader, or technician, must have completed additional training appropriate for the
functions to be performed.




1 April 2008         FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                    III-5
                 •    The competency and training requirements for local responders and
technical experts are defined in 29 CFR 1910.120; NFPA Standard 471, Recommended
Practice for Responding to Hazardous Materials Incidents; NFPA Standard 472; NFPA
Standard 473, Standard for Competencies for Emergency Medical Services Personnel
Responding to Hazardous Materials Incidents; and in reference resources such as the
FEMA Guidelines for Public Sector Hazardous Materials Training.
                 (b) Specific Requirements. Personnel who participate, or expect to
participate, in emergency response shall complete the following training:
                 •   Responder awareness-level training is for personnel who are likely to
witness or discover an incident and have been trained to initiate an emergency response
sequence. This training should be provided for all unit personnel. These personnel would
take no further action beyond notifying the authorities of the hazard.
                 •    Responder operations-level training is required for personnel who
respond to incidents as part of the initial response to protect persons, property, or the
environment from the effects of the hazard. This includes security forces, incident response
team (IRT) members, and emergency medical personnel. These personnel are trained to
respond in a defensive fashion without actually trying to contain the hazard. They are
required to receive training equal to responder awareness-level training and to demonstrate
additional competencies according to service training guidelines.
               •    HAZMAT technician-level unit and individual training is provided for
personnel who respond to contain the hazard. This training is required for HAZMAT team
members. They are required to receive training equal to responder operations-level training
and to demonstrate additional competencies according to service training guidelines.
                  •   On-scene IC-level training is needed for unit leaders to assume control
of the incident scene. They are required to receive training equal to responder operations-
level training and to demonstrate additional competencies according to service training
guidelines.
                  (c)   Training Evaluations.
                 •    Evaluations can be internal or external. Internal evaluations are
conducted at all levels and are incorporated into all training. External evaluations are
usually more formal and are conducted by the next higher headquarters.
                 •    Failure to evaluate each task every time it is executed is a critical
weakness in training. The exercise evaluation concept is based on simultaneous training
and evaluation. Every training exercise provides the potential for evaluation feedback. The
evaluation is a training session. For the program to work, trainers and leaders must
continually evaluate training as it is executed.
              •    External evaluations are administered at the discretion of the chain of
command and are conducted to evaluate the unit’s ability to perform its critical response
missions.
4.      Coordinating, Monitoring, and Reporting Requirements
        a.   Coordinating.
         (1) Response Unit Coordination. One major objective of CBRN CM
preparedness efforts is to ensure mission integration and interoperability during responses


III-6             FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37             1 April 2008
to emergent crises across functional and organizational lines and between public and
private organizations. Each response unit must make certain that its CBRN CM response
plan has been coordinated with other applicable response elements; with the response plans
of local, state, and federal organizations; and with the plans of any JTFs, coalition forces, or
HN.
            (2) Focus of Coordination Efforts. Coordination is conducted within and
between military response units and surrounding area resources (civil or HN). Good
coordination efforts help to ensure that proper emphasis has been placed on planning
(identifying threats, determining vulnerabilities, and identifying required resources),
training and exercises, personnel qualification and certification, equipment certification,
and other preparedness requirements. Coordination efforts focus on identifying the range of
deliberate and critical planning tasks and activities necessary to build, sustain, and
improve the operational capability of the response unit’s plans to prevent, protect against,
respond to, and recover from any CBRN incident. Coordination allows the response unit to
refine its plan by—
               •   Identifying assets and resources available.
               •   Refining how a unit will task-organize with other responders.
               •   Identifying communications methods and procedures.
               •   Maintaining a reachback database.
           •      Developing common operating procedures and details and an
understanding of each unit’s role in the plan. The unit can request, collect, and assess all
available local, state, and federal plans and directives, to include mutual aid agreements
(MAAs), that involve CBRN preparedness and response. This information can be used to
help ensure that the unit’s needs are met and that interagency unity of effort is achieved.
         •     Developing and maintaining a COP of civil and military forces conducting
CM operations. This includes AO information, climate, infrastructure, and site
assessments.
               •   Maintaining a responder/EOC/Emergency Management Agency database.
               •   Maintaining duty rosters and call-up procedures.
               •   Preparing modeling information for known sensitive sites within its AO.
      b.   Monitoring. Any analysis of a response unit’s status should include a step-by­
step review of command standing operating procedures (SOPs) and associated formal
checklists. These emergency response SOP checklists should be analyzed to ensure that
maximum coordination between responding elements is addressed in each SOP.
       c.  Status Reporting. Each response unit periodically reports its operational status
to its parent unit, according to service guidance. Status reporting helps to ensure that
applicable incident plans are updated, executable, and relevant.
5.    Health Service Support
     DOD components implement a comprehensive deployment health program during
CBRN CM, which helps them effectively anticipate, recognize, evaluate, control, and
mitigate health threats encountered during deployments. During the preparation phase,
the commander and medical personnel of the responding unit must—


1 April 2008       FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                      III-7
      •    Ensure that response personnel maintain a high state of predeployment health
and medical readiness. This includes ensuring that response personnel complete or confirm
the (as current) Department of Defense (DD) Form 2795, (Pre-Deployment Health
Assessment), and ensuring that all completed forms are submitted to the Defense Medical
Surveillance System, which is maintained by the Army Medical Surveillance Activity,
United States Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM).
     •     Ensure that response personnel follow the requirements of a respiratory
protection program according to guidance from 29 CFR 1910-134, Respiratory Protection,
and DODI 6055.1, DOD Safety and Occupational Health (SOH) Program.
      •    Ensure that responding personnel are briefed on deployment health threats and
are trained and equipped with necessary countermeasures.
     •    Ensure that FHP prescription products (such as nerve agent antidote kits and
pyridostigmine tablets) are prescribed, as required.
     •   Ensure that all responding medical personnel are trained on the signs,
symptoms, medical countermeasures, and treatments of exposure to endemic diseases and
environmental, occupational, and CBRN health threats.
      •   Ensure that responding individuals’ immunization, medical, and dental records
are updated in a DOD-approved automated health information management system and
that custody for these records is established.
     •     Ensure that responding personnel have completed an occupational health
baseline examination prior to responding to an incident.
     •    Train, staff, equip, and provide support to conduct disease outbreak and OEH
exposure incident investigations, and ensure that reports and documentation of disease
outbreaks and OEH and CBRN exposures are reported.
        •   Identify all responder health resource requirements in OPLANs and OPORDs.
     •   Ensure that theater health surveillance plans and requirements are identified in
each OPLAN.
     •   Develop and implement health risk communication plans during all phases of
deployment to communicate health threats and countermeasures to all deployed personnel.
6.      Conducting Response Exercises
      a.   Education and training alone are not enough to adequately prepare response
units. Realistic exercises are required to ensure that operations can be conducted under
CBRN conditions. State and local response plans must be understood by responders.
Participation in federal, state, and local exercises increases interoperability and
supportability to those plans. Aspects to consider when developing an exercise should
include the following:
            (1) Participants. Include as many participants as possible from all appropriate
local, state, federal, and HN CM agencies.
            (2)   Realism.
                (a) Ensure that CBRN CM scenarios that units could face based on the
current threat assessment are realistic.



III-8             FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37           1 April 2008
               (b) Provide realistic master events sequence lists that exercise each
aspect of CBRN CM collective tasks. Include unexpected challenges (such as disabling key
personnel and equipment) to assess the resiliency of the response process.
               (3)   Scheduling.
              (a) Align unit exercise and training schedules with the combatant
commander (CCDR), HN, and DOS-related CBRN exercises. HN civilians and units
supporting CM operations may require frequent rehearsals and refresher training.
                (b) When possible, response units should consider aligning its exercise
and training schedules with the DHS exercise and training programs for state and local
preparedness programs to include weapons of mass destruction-civil support teams
(WMD-CSTs), as appropriate.
            (4) Leadership Exercises. Tabletop exercises should be used to provide the
leadership and staff opportunities to war-game multiple scenarios. Tabletop training
exercises are specifically designed for leaders to train in executing critical missions and
critical collective tasks.
     b.    Each exercise should be designed to evaluate specific critical missions or tasks
within the overall evaluation scenario. The evaluators must be thoroughly familiar with all
aspects of the test in order to implement it correctly. The use of realistic exercises is
required to ensure that the installation can conduct operations under CBRN or TIM
conditions.
      c.   Each evaluator, regardless of position, must have expert knowledge of the
capabilities and responsibilities, communications equipment, weapons, and vehicles, and
should thoroughly understand the mission. Poor evaluator training may result in poor
after-action or lessons-learned information.
NOTE: The following link prepares an evaluation staff for evaluating a CBRN CM
exercise: <http://www.training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/downloads/IS139EvalPlan.doc>.
7.    Evaluate Capabilities and Identify Remaining Vulnerabilities
      a.   The response unit’s CBRN defense vulnerability assessment must be a
continuous process (see Figure III-2, page III-10). Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Vulnerability Assessment
provides further guidance on the VA cycle. Following the implementation of a CM plan, the
response unit starts scheduling periodic follow-ups to reassess CBRN CM preparation.
These periodic follow-ups help ensure that necessary resources remain properly deployed,
prepared, and synchronized to successfully execute CBRN CM tasks. However, the timing
of these reassessments should not be based strictly on time (calendar year, etc.). Other
factors, such as changes in the threat or changes in unit or resource availability, should
also be considered.




1 April 2008         FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                     III-9
               Figure III-2. Vulnerability Assessment During the Preparation Phase
     b.   Preincident checks reverify that response units have supplies and equipment
such as the required PPE.
      c.    The measures that comprise protection actions also provide VA feedback. This
feedback improves the overall response plan. For example, response personnel may take
notice of the shortcomings of HN protective equipment (protective ponchos issued by some
nations may be effective in protecting against a direct spray hazard would provide little
protection against regional mustard contamination).
8.       National Special Security Events
      a.     JP 3-41 defines NSSE as “events of national significance that require greater
visibility” (such as the Olympics). In preparation for CM operations, DOD response assets
may be tasked to support NSSE. This unique CM operation requires DOD assets to prepare
for possible CM scenarios, deploy, and be prepared to respond, prior to any incident
occurring. Preparations for NSSE operations are based on the event supported and the
mission the unit is assigned. In many instances, a unit can even be pre-positioned near the
site where the CBRN CM operation could occur.
      b.    An important aspect of preparation for CM at an NSSE is the ability of the unit
to directly interface with its counterparts to fully determine its role in the planned
response. Unlike other preincident preparation where the exact role of the unit cannot be
known until the scope and magnitude of the CBRN incident is determined, the NSSE
involves the preexecution of a response plan to such a degree that many of the responding
assets are pre-positioned and prepared to execute its part on very short notice.




III-10            FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37               1 April 2008
                                        Chapter IV 

                                      RESPONSE 


1.    Background
      a.   CBRN incidents may occur without warning and at a time of day and location
that will produce chaos, confusion, and casualties. In a no-notice incident, local emergency
services and possibly state and federal agency personnel will be the responders. Notification
from local responders to a nearby DOD military command may trigger an immediate
response to save lives, prevent human suffering, or mitigate great property damage.
Notification of an approved RFA triggers the domestic emergency response provided by
DOD. DOD personnel support for FCM operations requires approval from the DOS.
            (1) The major functions performed by CBRN CM response units are
safeguarding lives, preserving health and safety, securing and eliminating the hazard,
protecting property, preventing further damage to the environment, and maintaining public
confidence in the government’s ability to respond to a CBRN incident. See Figure IV-1 for
the response phase relative to the other phases of the CBRN CM response. Responding
forces initiate actions to restore conditions at and in the vicinity of the incident site.
Transition and redeployment plans are developed once the role of the DOD force is
established and follow-on local, state, and federal assets have been determined.




               Figure IV-1. CBRN Consequence Management Process (Respond)
           (2) Although DOD’s primary CM focus is minimizing the effects of CBRN on
military operations, it must also be prepared to support the response to a CBRN incident in
the homeland and support allies and partners. To defend against and recover from CBRN


1 April 2008     FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                    IV-1
use, U.S. armed forces must execute passive-defensive measures and be prepared to
conduct CBRN CM activities. If prevention efforts fail and a CBRN attack cannot be
prevented, DOD must be prepared to respond to RFAs; initiate or support ongoing CM
efforts; and actively support local, state, and federal or allied and partner authorities.
      b.   The sequence and time of a response to a CBRN incident depends on factors such
as the operational environment (DCM or FCM), the magnitude of the CBRN incident, and
the resources needed to respond. Table IV-1 provides a general flow of events for a CBRN
incident response.

                  Table IV-1. Flow of Events for a CBRN Incident Response (Notional)
                 Event                                                     Action
       Trigger                    A CBRN incident occurs that requires a response (explosion, dissemination,
                                  appearance of symptoms, etc.).
       Initiate response          A local response team responds to the incident.
       Initiate ICS               The response team identifies the need to establish ICS.

       access                      •    Establish a security perimeter around the incident scene.
                                   •    Assure safe approach and positioning of emergency response resources
                                        at the incident site.
                                   •    Establish a staging area as a method of controlling response resources at
                                        the incident site.
       Establish incident          The IC establishes an ICP outside of the present and potential hazard zone
       command post (CP)           but close enough to the incident to maintain command.
                                   •    Location is disseminated.
                                   •    Incident reporting continues.
       Identify the               Responders—
       hazard/assess the           •    Evaluate all available information (such as placards and shipping
       situation (ongoing)              documents).
                                   •    Try to answer questions, such as—
                                        •    Is there a fire, spill, or plume?
                                        •    What are the weather conditions?
                                        •    What is the terrain like?
                                        •    Who/what is at risk?
                                        •    What action should be taken?
                                        •    What can be done immediately (such as evacuate, SIP, or

2.      Incident Response Overview
          a.       First Response.
               (1)     First response is conducted by local and nongovernmental police, fire,
and emergency personnel. In its most basic form, first responders are individuals who are
likely to witness or discover a hazardous substance release and who have been trained to
initiate an emergency response sequence by notifying the proper authorities of the release.
In its more advanced form, first responders are personnel who are trained to operational or
technical levels.
            (2)    Personnel who provide first response support include local and
nongovernmental police, fire, and emergency personnel who, in the early stages of an


IV-2                     FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                            1 April 2008
incident, are responsible for the protection and preservation of life, property, evidence, and
the environment, including emergency response providers as defined in Section 2 of the
Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 USC 101).
        b.         Emergency Response.
              (1)    Emergency response occurs when responders from outside the
immediate release area deploy to an occurrence which resulted in, or is likely to result in,
an uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance. Responses to releases of hazardous
substances where there is no potential safety or health hazard are not considered to be
emergency responses.
             (2)    Representative functions of emergency response include firefighting,
law enforcement, security, medical support, emergency management, EOD, and mortuary
affairs.
3.    Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Responder
      a. CBRN responders are DOD military and civilian personnel who are trained to
respond to CBRN incidents and certified to operate safely at the awareness, operations, or
technician level according to 29 CFR 1910.120 and NFPA Standard 472. The various levels
of CBRN responders are as follows:
            (1) CBRN Responder (Awareness Level). CBRN responders at the awareness
level are individuals who are likely to witness or discover a CBRN or hazardous material
release and who have been trained to initiate an emergency response sequence by notifying
the proper authorities of the release. They would take no further action beyond notifying
the authorities of the release. CBRN responders at the awareness level shall have had
sufficient training or experience to demonstrate the following competencies:
           •   Understand what CBRN or hazardous substances are and the risks
associated with them in an incident.
         •   Understand the potential outcomes associated with an emergency created
when hazardous substances are present.
               •    Recognize the presence of CBRN or hazardous substances in an emergency.
               •    Identify the CBRN or hazardous substances, if possible.
          •   Understand the awareness-level responder’s role in the employer’s
emergency response plan, including site security and control and the Emergency Response
Guide: A Guide for First Responders During the Initial Phase of a Dangerous
Goods/Hazardous Materials Incident.
           •     Recognize the need for additional resources and make appropriate
notifications to the communication center.
            (2) CBRN Responder (Operations Level). CBRN responders at the operations
level are individuals who respond to releases or potential releases of CBRN or hazardous
material as part of the initial response to the site for the purpose of protecting nearby
persons, property, or the environment from the effects of the release. They are trained to
respond in a defensive fashion without actually trying to stop the release. In addition to
awareness-level training, CBRN responders at the operational level shall have had
sufficient training or experience to demonstrate the following competencies:



1 April 2008         FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                  IV-3
             •   Know basic hazard and CBRN risk assessment techniques.
             •   Know how to select and use proper PPE provided to the operational-level
responder.
             •   Understand basic hazardous and CBRN material terms.
          •    Know how to perform basic control, containment, and confinement
operations within the capabilities of the resources and PPE available within the unit.
             •   Know how to implement basic decontamination procedures.
             •   Understand the relevant SOPs and termination procedures.
            (3) CBRN Responder (Technician Level). CBRN responders at the technician
level are individuals who respond to releases or potential releases for the purpose of
stopping the release. In addition to awareness- and operations-level training, CBRN
responders at the technician level shall have the following competencies:
             •   Know how to implement emergency response plans.
           •    Know how to classify, identify, and verify known and unknown materials by
using field survey instruments and equipment.
             •   Be able to function within an assigned role in the ICS.
             •   Know how to select and use proper specialized CBRN PPE.
             •   Understand hazard and risk assessment techniques.
          •    Be able to perform advanced control, containment, and confinement
operations within the capabilities of the resources and PPE available with the unit.
             •   Understand and implement decontamination procedures.
             •   Understand termination procedures.
             •   Understand basic CBRN and toxicological terminology and behavior.
       b.    See Appendix D for more information on training for CBRN responders.
4.     Response Environment
     a.    Department of Defense Role. DOD forces responding in a domestic or foreign CM
response environment act in a supporting role and will not take control from the IC.
However, in a DOD-led response environment, the U.S. military will assume the lead role.
For example, a geographic combatant commander (GCC) may develop plans for DOD-led
CBRN CM missions within their assigned AOR. If required, the GCC may designate and/or
establish a Joint Task Force–Consequence Management (JTF-CM). The JTF-CM would
then be tailored to meet the specific requirements of a CBRN CM mission.
       b.    Command and Control.
           (1) Notification. Notification of a CBRN CM support mission will be processed
through normal military channels, and notification of the units tasked to provide support
will commence using local SOPs. Generally, a unit may be notified when the installation
EOC and command receives an approved RFA and provides a warning order (WARNORD)
to the units tasked to provide the support.




IV-4              FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37            1 April 2008
           (2) Warning and Reporting. Military warning and reporting procedures are still
applicable to DOD units while supporting CBRN CM operations (see Multiservice Tactics,
Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear
Contamination Avoidance). These common reporting procedures provide a means of
communicating hazards for the supporting DOD response units. Other reporting
requirements may be implemented by the IC during the response operation and should be
coordinated through the military liaison to ensure that the supporting military units
comply. See Appendix C for further information.
          (3) Liaison. Liaison provides information continuity between the supporting
military units and the IC to ensure effective two-way communication. This includes
information from the IC for local, state, and federal plans and directives, to include other
representative information such as established MAAs.
               (4)   Immediate Response Authority.
                (a) Immediate response is defined by JP 1-02 as any form of immediate
action taken to assist civil authorities or the public to save lives, prevent human suffering,
or mitigate great property damage under imminently serious conditions when time does not
permit approval from a higher authority.
                 (b) DOD policy for immediate action to save lives, prevent human
suffering, or mitigate great property damage authorizes military commanders or
responsible officials of other DOD agencies to respond to civil authorities’ requests for
emergency military support. The policy is based on the law commonly known as the
Stafford Act, and it gives the commander authority to—
              •      Support an incident response without formal activation or direction
when immediate, serious conditions exist and time does not permit prior approval from
higher headquarters.
                •     Save lives, prevent human suffering, or mitigate major property
damage under immediate, serious conditions where there has not been a Presidential
declaration of a catastrophe, a major disaster, or an emergency.
                 (c) While the policy allows for an immediate response, it requires
commanders to advise the DOD Executive Secretary, through command channels and by
the most expeditious means available, and to seek approval or additional authorizations as
needed. Although an immediate response may be provided on a reimbursable basis, it will
not be delayed or denied because of the inability or unwillingness of the requester to make
a commitment to reimburse DOD. Commanders must exercise extreme caution if electing to
deploy under the auspices of an immediate response. Immediate response authority is not a
basis for using established MAAs. While this policy allows for great flexibility, commanders
must ensure that immediate-response deployment authority is used as a last resort.
      c.   Tiered Response. DOD forces will be employed as part of a flexible tiered
response, and military support will be tailored to support a Tier I, II, or III response. The
scope and magnitude of the military response will focus on providing capabilities that meet
the response requirements that are beyond the resources of civil authorities. See JP 3-41 for
more details.
          (1) Tier I is normally implemented for small-scale, localized CBRNE incidents
that meet Secretary of Defense criteria outlined in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff



1 April 2008         FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                   IV-5
(CJCS) Concept Plan (CONPLAN) 0500, Military Assistance to Domestic Consequence
Management Operations in Response to a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, or
High-Yield Explosive Situation. In a Tier I situation, the DCO can effectively exercise
command over the small number of DOD forces required and still execute his functional
responsibilities with respect to processing mission assignments.
           (2) Tier II is the normal response posture for CBRNE incidents having met the
Secretary of Defense criteria to implement CJCS CONPLAN 0500 and the need to establish
a JTF to respond to the incident. Specialized units, detachments, teams, supplies, and
equipment will likely be required from DOD in Tier II.
          (3) Tier III involves extremely complex CBRNE scenarios impacting a wide
geographic area or a large population—or threatening national security.
5.     Joint Operational Phases for Consequence Management
        a.      CBRN response is an organized response effort employed to mitigate hazards
for an emergency resulting from a deliberate or unintentional CBRN release. The Joint
Director of Military Support (JDOMS), located within the operations directorate of a joint
staff (J-3), produces military orders that pertain to domestic emergencies. The J-3 forwards
the orders to the Secretary of Defense for approval and then to the appropriate military
commander for execution. A six-step process is initiated when an RFA is received from a
lead or other primary agency.
       •    The lead or other primary agency initiates the RFA.
       •    The RFA is sent to the DOD Executive Secretary for assessment and processing.
     •    The RFA is processed and sent to the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Homeland
Defense) and the JDOMS.
       •    The JDOMS processes the order.
       •    The Secretary of Defense approves the order.
       •    The JDOMS issues the order to appropriate CCDRs, services, and agencies.
       b.   The response is generally conducted in the following sequence:
           (1) Request for Support. When a CBRN incident occurs, the lead agency
receives and generates requests for support, and DOD may be tasked to provide resources.
Although specific unit taskings may occur, the requestor normally asks for a capability to
meet an identified shortfall. A representative list of units and/or activities that can support
CBRN CM is provided in Appendix A.
                (a) Prescripted RFAs may be used by the lead agency to expedite the
process for requesting support. Prior to preparing a prescripted RFA, the preparer
considers what federal agency has the unique capability to satisfy the requirement.
                 (b) Since prescripting RFAs can assist with time-sensitive response
requirements, the preparer should prioritize the capabilities required for the incident. The
following factors should be considered when preparing a prescripted RFA:
                 •    Unique capabilities of the supporting agency.
                 •    Lifesaving capabilities of the supporting agency.




IV-6              FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37               1 April 2008
                   •   Agency capabilities that can reduce the scope, scale, and/or impact of
the incident.
           (2) Alert. Upon notification of a CBRN response mission, tasked military
support elements initiate local alert procedures and prepare to deploy to the incident site.
Commanders and staff gather the information required to prepare their units to support
the response efforts.
            (3) Deploy. Deploying the needed military support assets at the appropriate
time is the key to success. Establishing a base support installation (BSI), which may take
place during the alert phase or during a transition between these phases, is a key
consideration. CBRN response units, with direction from the parent unit and service, are
responsible for coordinating and executing predeployment activities, movement to and
activities at ports of embarkation (POEs), and arrival at ports of debarkation (PODs).
Deployment ends when the applicable DOD forces are secured in the AO and the military
support commander determines that forces are ready to execute the mission. Deployment
considerations include—
               •   Using all transportation modes to deploy supporting CBRN CM response
units.
           •     Phasing the movement of CBRN CM response units so transportation
capabilities are not overwhelmed.
               •   Prioritizing the movement of CBRN CM response units.
           •    Immunizing CBRN CM response unit personnel to prevent unnecessary
delays in response posture.
           •    Ensuring that units meet HSS standards established for the operation
prior to deployment into an AO.
           •    Coordinating with the BSI for reception, staging, onward movement, and
integration (RSOI) operations.
          (4) Transition. Transitioning encompasses the remaining tasks the DOD
response elements must complete prior to redeployment. Transition is discussed further in
Chapter V.
           (5) Redeployment. Redeploying the supporting military units begins when
directed by the commander. Redeployment is discussed in further detail in Chapter V.
6.    Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Response Operations
     a.    The initiation of response operations occurs following a triggering incident.
Response measures include the first and emergency response, establishment of the ICS,
ensuring that requisite control measures are in place, and execution of mission-essential
functions that occur in the hazard control zones.
      b.   Triggering Incident. Triggering refers to the initial event, or sequence of events,
which causes response actions to begin. Trigger help to determine when a response to the
incident begins. A trigger may prompt an immediate DOD response (conditions permitting)
or a delayed response based on DOD approval of a validated RFA. Information from the
triggering incident supports the ongoing assessment and will influence the follow-on




1 April 2008       FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                    IV-7
response actions. An effective response will drive a more effective recovery phase, limit the
severity of the CBRN event on operations, and reduce the overall number of casualties.
           (1) Detector triggers occur when a detection device signals that a CBRN agent
may be present in the environment. Detectors are limited to those CBRN agents they are
designed to find. They may not indicate the presence or absence of all CBRN agents due to
the sensitivity of the devices and the possibility of false-positive and false-negative
readings.
            (2) Weapon triggers refer to an overt attack by a weapons system, such as
theater ballistic missiles, submunitions, or artillery that might be armed with a CBRN
agent. If intelligence has indicated a CBRN-weapons capability, a weapons incident in a
high-threat area will likely be initially treated as an unknown agent. Detection of an attack
in progress may result from an attack warning, a detector alarm, or observable weapons
incident. During and immediately after an attack, the top priority should be to determine
whether it was a CBRN attack. Detection, observation, or other notices of attack prior to
the occurrence of casualties trigger during-attack actions, which are initially focused on
immediate actions to preserve human life.
           (3) MEDSURV may be the first means of detection for a CBRN incident,
especially in the case of sentinel casualties discovered following a covert biological attack. A
sentinel casualty triggering incident refers to the medical community’s detection of a
biological agent or infectious disease incident by assessing trends in medical symptoms
among personnel or diagnosis of an index case. Response actions based on a sentinel
casualty may begin well into the disease progression cycle. At its highest level, MEDSURV
could occur through the theater MEDSURV network, where epidemiology is focused on
theater-wide tracking of medical symptoms.
           (4) Intelligence triggers occur when a commander receives intelligence
indicating that a threat possesses an offensive CBRN capability, that there is unusual
threat activity consistent with operational use of a CBRN agent, or that a specific target
may be attacked with a CBRN agent. Intelligence warning is the triggering incident that
allows a commander the best opportunity to prepare for a response.
     c.    First, Emergency, and CBRN Response. Based on the initial and follow-on
assessments, the response to a CBRN incident is tailored to the scope and magnitude of the
situation, and follow-on response assets are requested as required.
           (1) First response is conducted by local police, fire, and emergency personnel
who are likely to witness or discover a CBRN release and notify the proper authorities of
the release. The first response elements use resources such as the Emergency Response
Guide to identify the associated hazards and determine hazard control zones. These zones
take into consideration the CBRN material, population or area threatened, and weather
conditions. Efforts are made by the first response element arriving at the incident to ensure
that no one enters the hazard control zones without authorization from the ICP.
         (2) Emergency response is conducted by trained responders from outside the
immediate release area.
           (3) CBRN response is conducted by military CBRN responders with specialties
in areas such as decontamination, site assessment, response planning, or C2.




IV-8             FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                1 April 2008
        d.      First Receivers. Health care workers at a hospital receiving contaminated
victims for treatment are a subset of responders (firefighters, law enforcement, HAZMAT
teams, and ambulance service personnel). Most responders typically act at the site of an
incident (the location where the primary release occurred). In contrast, inherent to the
definition of first receivers, is an assumption that the hospital is not itself the primary
incident site, but rather is remote from the location where the hazardous substance release
occurred. Refer to OSHA Best Practices for Hospital-Based First Receivers of Victims from
Mass Casualty Incidents Involving the Release of Hazardous Substances for more
information on first receivers.
      e.    ICS Initiation. Under circumstances when the ICS will be used, the senior
responder at the incident site—who is most experienced for the type of incident—assumes
the role of the IC. The IC is responsible for directing, assessing, prioritizing, and controlling
resources by virtue of explicit legal, agency, or delegated authority. As the response
progresses, the role of the IC may change hands as more qualified responders arrive on the
scene or are appointed. Further information about the functions of the ICS can be found in
Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Installation Chemical, Biological,
Radiological, and Nuclear Defense and the NIMS. See Figure IV-2 for a graphic
representation of the ICS command structure.

        f.   Site Assessment.
           (1) Although the IC’s initial site assessment may be completed before military
response units arrive at the incident site, assessment is a continual process. Assessment at
the incident site considers multiple factors, to include—
             •    Weather.
             •    Terrain.
             •    Infrastructure.
          •      Agent characteristics (flammability, toxicity, corrosiveness, radioactivity,
oxygen levels, etc.).
             •    Response unit capabilities.
             •    Workload.
             •    Time.
             •    Deadlines.
            (2) Representative tasks that support assessment include CBRN detection,
identification, and surveillance. The results of detection, identification, and surveillance
support identifying the specific hazards and determining the extent or degree of
contamination.
           (3) Other assessment support during response operations can be obtained
through agencies that provide technical reachback. See Appendix A for a representative list
of technical reachback agencies.
      g.    Control Measures. The IC establishes control measures to prevent or reduce the
spread of contamination, human injury or death, environmental damage, and property
damage from the release or potential release of CBRN or HAZMAT materials. All control
measures are coordinated and controlled through the IC, the focal point for key information
(such as the presence of CBRN agents or maximum exposure limits). The IC determines the
level of protection that will be worn or available in each of the hazard control zones.
Representative control measures include—
           (1) PPE. Based on hazardous substances and conditions present, the IC will
implement appropriate emergency operations and ensure that the PPE worn is appropriate
for the hazards expected to be encountered. For example, responders who are engaged in
CBRN defense and emergency response who are exposed to hazardous substances of
unknown quantities will wear a positive-pressure self-contained breathing apparatus
(SCBA). They will continue to wear SCBA until the IC or designated safety officer
determines a decreased level of respiratory protection will not result in hazardous exposure.
           (2) Limited Access. The IC will limit the number of response personnel at the
emergency site who enter areas of potential or actual exposure to incident or site hazards.
Personnel will be limited to those who are actively performing emergency operations;
however, operations in hazardous areas will be performed using the buddy system in
groups of two or more.
          (3) Contamination Control. The IC initiates defensive contamination control
operations in order to limit the spread of contamination. This includes preventing



IV-10             FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37               1 April 2008
potentially contaminated personnel from leaving the scene without being decontaminated,
controlling water runoff, and beginning emergency decontamination.
           (4) Site Security. The IC ensures that safe site management activities have
been instituted. The site is secured by establishing a security perimeter and controlling site
access to prevent additional personnel from entering the contaminated area(s) and to
prevent media personnel or bystanders from interfering with responders.
         (5) Decontamination. The IC directs that the following types of
decontamination operations can be conducted in the decontamination corridor:
               •   Emergency decontamination.
               •   Technical decontamination.
               •   MCD.
           (6) Hazard Control Zones. The IC identifies and designates hazard control
zones, including initial isolation and protective action zones and hot, warm, and cold zones.
                   (a)     Initial Isolation and Protective Action Zones.
               •     The initial isolation zone is an area surrounding the incident in which
persons may be exposed to dangerous (upwind) and life threatening (downwind)
concentrations of material.
                •     The protective action zone is an area downwind from the incident in
which persons may become incapacitated and unable to take protective action and/or incur
serious or irreversible health effects. See Figure IV-3 for a graphic depiction of the initial
isolation and protective action zones.




                         Figure IV-3. Initial Isolation and Protective Action Zones
                 (b) Hot, Warm, and Cold Zones. Hazard control zones (hot, warm, and
cold) are established to provide areas for functions such as decontamination and support
operations.




1 April 2008       FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                   IV-11
                •   The hot zone is an area immediately surrounding a hazardous
materials incident which extends far enough to prevent adverse effects from released
contamination to personnel outside the zone.
                 •     The warm zone is the area between the hot and cold zones where
personnel and equipment decontamination and hot zone support take place. It includes
control points for the access corridor and thus assists in reducing the spread of
contamination.
                • The cold zone is the area where the CP and support functions that are
necessary to control the incident are located. See Figure IV-4 for an example of hazard
control zones.
           (7) Access Routes. The IC identifies safe approaches along multiple routes, if
available, for the movement of response assets to and from the incident site and assembly
areas. The routes identified include road, rail, sea, and aerial approaches to the incident
site.




                        Figure IV-4. Hazard Control Zones (Example)
          (8) Staging Areas. The IC designates assembly areas for the staging of follow-on
response elements. The initial assembly point is a safe distance from the incident site to
prevent interference and to protect personnel.
     h.    Hazard Control Zone Functions. Control zones are established by the IC at an
incident site. Control zones are established to ensure the safety of all responders and
control access into and out of a contaminated area. Figure IV-5 depicts hazard control zone
functions.




IV-12           FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37              1 April 2008
                           Figure IV-5. Hazard Control Zone Functions
            (1) Hot Zone. The hot zone is the area that the IC judges to be the most
affected by the incident and includes any area to which the contaminant has spread or is
likely to spread. The hot zone is also the location where contamination reduction begins,
and representative functions that can occur within the hot zone include—
               •   Conducting search and rescue operations.
               •   Performing mitigation measures.
               •   Identifying CBRN or other physical obstacles to the entry point.
         •      Conducting assessment activities (evaluating damage and/or presence of
contamination, etc.).
               •   Performing chemical or radiological monitoring.
               •   Conducting biological agent sampling.
          (2) Warm Zone. The warm zone is the area between the hot and cold zones
where decontamination operations (decontamination corridor) and hot zone support take
place. Representative functions that can occur in the warm zone include—
               •   Emergency decontamination.
               •   Technical decontamination.
               •   MCD.
               •   Staging of survey teams prior to entry into the hot zone.
               •   Equipment decontamination.

           (3) Cold Zone. The cold zone is an area that is readily accessible and provides a
clean location for support operations. It must be large enough to accommodate local, state,
and federal CBRN response forces, if required. Representative functions that can occur
within the cold zone include—
             •    Incident command operations.
             •    Support activities such as logistic, sustainment, and security operations.
             •    Staging area operations.
     i.   Hazard Communications (HAZCOM). During response operations, units
maintain its HAZCOM program. Representative HAZCOM program execution functions
include—
     •    Sustaining the capability to store and use regulatory reference data and product
hazard data.
        •    Preparing to receive and process CBRN materials information.
        •    Maintaining access to information on CBRN hazards at the incident site.
        •    Adhering to safety guidance as contained in applicable OSHA and CFR guidance.

7.      Health Service Support Response Activities
    a.    The medical C2 element maintains C2 of deploying DOD medical responders.
These C2 functions include—
        •    Assigning missions and dispatching units/staffs to designated response areas.
     •      Coordinating DOD medical response activities with the IC and local, state,
federal, or HN response agencies.
     •    Determining when the response units/staff are to stand down and turn over their
response activities to local, state, federal, HN, or other response agencies.
      b.    Most HSS response activities are continued throughout the recovery phase of CM
operations. The HSS response activities of preventive medicine (PVNTMED), veterinary
services, stress management support for response forces and the local populace, laboratory
services, and health service logistics are detailed in Appendix C. Triage, patient
decontamination, treatment, evacuation, and hospitalization will be addressed in Chapter
V and Appendix D, Recovery Operations.
        c.   Immediate response may be provided by―
        •    On-scene personnel providing basic first aid.
     •    Prestaged specialized DOD assets capable of providing emergency care in the hot
zone and patient stabilization in the cold zone until civilian EMS transport is available.
Such assets include the chemical-biological incident response force (CBIRF) and CBRNE
Enhanced Response Force Package (CERFP).
      •    Military installation activities providing immediate support such as EMS
personnel, medical treatment teams, PVNTMED personnel, veterinary personnel,
firefighters, and military police.




IV-14              FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37             1 April 2008
     •    Local police and firefighters; EMS, public health, and public works personnel;
and designated medical treatment teams.
      •        Country teams, HN medical assets, and DOD units/personnel in FCM situations.
      d.   Medical diagnosis is the process of determining the cause of a disease or injury.
While some diagnoses are made evident by signs and symptoms, definitive diagnosis of
infection or chemical exposure may require laboratory or radiology studies. These studies
may take several days. Empiric treatment must begin prior to a definitive diagnosis in
order to save lives. Medical reachback is a method for the responding HSS elements and
organizations to obtain technical medical consultation and support during CBRN CM
response activities. Organizations and activities within DOD and other federal agencies
provide these services.
     e.    HSS activities are based on the predeployment health risk assessment of the
health threats in the AO and the specific deployment location. Health risk assessments,
OEH site assessments, routine and incident-driven monitoring and sampling, and other
health surveillance activities should be updated during deployment. If health threats
increase or can be anticipated to increase during the deployment, commanders should
implement additional HSS to ensure that personnel are adequately monitored and
protected.
      f.   During a CBRN CM response, OEH site assessments, site reconnaissance, and
food and water VAs (refer to DODD 6400.4, DOD Veterinary Services Program) are
conducted to validate actual or potential health threats, evaluate exposure pathways, and
determine COAs and countermeasures to control or reduce the health threats and protect
the health of deployed personnel. When conducting CM response, consider the following
tasks:
        (1) Ensure that DOD- or Service-approved automated health information
management system is used to capture OEH monitoring data.
           (2) Ensure that health risk communications (written or oral) are based on
health risk assessments and health CRM decisions, and update the health risk as new
information becomes available.
           (3) Document deployment occupational and environmental exposures or CBRN
exposures and related monitoring data, and provide timely reporting of disease and
nonbattle injuries (DNBIs), battle injuries, and other medical information, as required.
           (4) Submit medical information related to CBRN, unanticipated infectious
disease, or environmental contamination occurrences to the Armed Forces Medical
Intelligence Center (AFMIC). Also, provide copies of operational medical reports, which
include descriptions and/or assessments of infectious diseases, environmental findings, and
medical capability, to the AFMIC.
     g.    A respiratory protection program includes medical screening and surveillance of
personnel issued respirators (such as SCBA) as an occupational requirement for CBRN
operations (such as DSCA). See 29 CFR 1910.134, Respiratory Protection, and DODI 6055.1
for more information.

8.      Transition to Recovery Operations
      a.   A fine, unclear line exists between the end of response operations and the
beginning of recovery operations. Often, recovery starts while response operations are still
in progress. Recovery operations may begin when military response assets are no longer
required or when replacements have arrived to provide relief in place. Chapter V discusses
recovery operations for CBRN CM operations.
      b.    Additionally, there may be a handover of response authorities and
responsibilities when transitioning from response to recovery. For example, a responding
fire chief may hand over control of the scene to crime investigators, incident investigation
teams, or other officials.




IV-16            FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37              1 April 2008

                                      RECOVERY 


1.    Background
     a.    The recovery phase will begin when the immediate hazards are contained or
controlled during the response phase. See Figure V-1 for the recovery phase relative to the
other phases of the CBRN CM process. CBRN first responders will likely continue support
to complete any remaining mitigation of the immediate hazard (supporting reconnaissance,
decontamination, and assessment and providing advisory assistance). Understanding and
defining CBRN CM recovery operations requires a crosswalk between the traditional
military term and the NRP definition.
             (1) JP 1-02 defines recovery and reconstitution as those actions taken “to
minimize the effects of an attack, rehabilitate the national economy, provide for the welfare
of the populace, and maximize the combat potential of remaining forces and supporting
activities.”
           (2) The NRP addresses recovery in terms of “the development, coordination,
and execution of service- and site-restoration plans and the reconstitution of government
operations and services through individual, private-sector, nongovernmental, and public
assistance programs.”




               Figure V-1. CBRN Consequence Management Process (Recover)
           (3) Overall, CBRN recovery operations occur within the context of CM and
include those actions taken to maintain or restore essential services and manage and
mitigate the consequences resulting from a CBRN incident.




1 April 2008     FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                       V-1
     b.   The operational duration of the recovery mission for CBRN responders is
determined by the requirements established by the appropriate authority (the IC for
domestic operations or the HN and/or DOS for foreign operations). The operational role for
CBRN responders changes during the recovery phase. During recovery operations, survey
operations may continue in the hot zone while supporting technical decontamination.
Additionally, technical advice and assistance and support to other decontamination
operations (clearance or terrain decontamination) may occur.
      c.   The CBRN unit commander revises the mission-recovery plan prior to and
during the recovery phase and coordinates the plan with civil authorities to help ensure
that the transfer of tasks between civil authorities and military support commanders is
understood and completed. Top priorities for military commanders are reestablishing
mission capability, developing a plan to cover short- and long-term recovery requirements,
and returning to normal operations. Special consideration is given to minimizing and
mitigating environmental damage. The mission-recovery plan may address the following
areas:
           (1)   Logistical support and resupply.
           (2)   Protection.
          (3) Documentation and reporting requirements, to include resource
expenditures, losses, and environmental exposure data necessary to estimate personnel
exposure (to determine long- and short-term health effects).
           (4) Decontamination of equipment, infrastructure, and terrain. Military forces
may be requested to provide transportation for the affected population; assist with
decontamination efforts; and assist with segregating/isolating contaminated areas or
materials, restoring infrastructure, monitoring operations, and securing the contaminated
area.
           (5)   HSS activities, to include—
           •     Personal protection.
           •     Casualty-handling operations.
           •     Medical screening and documentation.
           •     Critical-incident stress management.
           •     Liaison with federal, state, local, and HN officials, as required.
      d.   The operational environment will impact CBRN CM decontamination as follows:
          •    For support of DHS-led CBRN CM operations in a domestic setting, DOD
response units will likely augment U.S. civilian response elements. Additionally, DOD
response units will be subject to OSHA and United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) requirements.
          •    For support of DOS-led CBRN CM operations in a foreign setting, DOD
response units may augment HN response elements, and actions may be bound by existing
HN treaty and/or status of forces agreements.
          •     In DOD-led CBRN CM response operations, recovery measures undertaken
will support the commander’s guidance and the overall CBRN CM goals.



V-2               FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                1 April 2008
      e.   There is no established timetable for recovery operations. During this phase,
there will come a time when military assets are replaced or are no longer needed. The
transition and order for redeployment may occur when military units receive a new
mission, the assigned mission is complete (such as MCD), or civilian authorities take over
the mission. The CBRN response unit commander facilitates the orderly transition from the
assigned recovery mission and conducts the withdrawal of military forces from the incident
site.
           (1) The military support commander implements the transition plan by
transferring CBRN CM tasks to the appropriate civil authorities (such as the DOS or
FEMA) commensurate with their ability to continue to conduct operations.
           (2) During transition, NGOs and contracted services may augment these civil
authorities. Upon completion of the required recovery support, military assets execute
transition and redeploy.
2. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Consequence Management
Decontamination
     a.   General. By the time the recovery phase has begun, decontamination efforts will
have started in order to minimize casualties, save lives, and limit the spread of
contamination. Clearance decontamination may have begun on specific mission-essential
equipment, materiel, or infrastructure. Clearance decontamination provides
decontamination to a level that allows unrestricted transportation, maintenance,
employment, and disposal of equipment. See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Decontamination for more
information. The following paragraphs discuss emergency, technical, and MCD operations
conducted during CBRN CM incidents.
     b.    Decontamination Principles. Decontamination is a process that reduces CBRN
contamination to levels that minimize the risk of further harm to the victim and cross
contamination. To support the goal of decontamination operations to provide effective
support for the largest number of personnel, apply the decontamination principles outlined
in Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological,
and Nuclear Decontamination. Those principles include—
      •        Speed.
      •        Need.
      •        Priority.
      •        Limited Area.
     c.    Decontamination Methods. Decontamination methods vary in its effectiveness
for removing different substances. The process of selecting a decontamination method
begins by identifying the substance quickly in order to define hazard control zones and the
most effective method of decontamination. The selection of a decontamination method will
rely on multiple sources of data, such as physical indicators, medical symptoms,
communication with victims, and detection instrument results. Continue to assess the
effectiveness of any decontamination method throughout the decontamination operation. If
decontamination




1 April 2008           FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37              V-3
does not appear to be effective, select and implement a different method. See Multiservice
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear
Decontamination for more information on decontamination methods. Decontamination is
based on one or more of the following methods:
           (1) Physical Methods. Physical methods of decontamination involve physically
removing the contaminant from the contaminated person or object and containing the
contaminant for disposal. While these methods can reduce the contaminant concentration,
the contained contaminant remains chemically unchanged. Examples of physical
decontamination methods include absorption, brushing and scraping, isolation and
disposal, vacuuming, and washing.
            (2) Chemical Methods. Chemical methods of decontamination are used on
equipment, not people, and involve changing the contaminant through some type of
chemical reaction in an effort to render the contaminant less harmful. In the case of
etiologic contaminants, chemical methods are actually biologically “killing” the organism.
Examples of chemical methods include adsorption, chemical degradation, disinfection or
sterilization, neutralization, and solidification.
            (3) Weathering. Weathering involves processes such as evaporation and
irradiation to remove or destroy the contaminant. The contaminated item is exposed to
natural elements (such as sun, wind, heat, and precipitation) to dilute or destroy the
contaminant to create a reduced or negligible hazard. This may be as simple as leaving a
vehicle sitting in the hot desert sun to bake off the contaminant. Natural weathering is the
simplest and most preferred method of decontamination, particularly for terrain and non-
mission-essential buildings and roads.
           (4) Preventive Methods. The risk of exposure is reduced and the need for
decontamination minimized if contact with a contaminant can be controlled. Work practices
that will minimize contact with hazardous substances should be emphasized. Limited-use
or disposable protective clothing and equipment should be worn.
     d.    Incident-Specific Decontamination Considerations. In order to determine what
decontamination practices may be followed, the CBRN responder assesses the
characteristics of the incident.
          (1)   Although data may be incomplete, the following factors should be
addressed:
          •     Number of casualties.
          •     Types of casualties.
          •     Type of agent.
          •     Agent properties.
          •     Type of release.
          •     Physical environment.
          •     Available resources.
          •     Operational desirability of various decontaminants (such as cold weather).
          •     Victim safety and privacy.



V-4              FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37              1 April 2008
          (2) For hazard-based decontamination during a mass casualty incident, the
number of victims may exceed the response capabilities of the CBRN responders.
Responders must then prioritize the rescue, treatment, and decontamination process.
Suggested prioritization factors include—
               •   Victim’s report of exposure.
               •   Physical signs and symptoms of exposure.
               •   Victim’s distance from the point of release of the agent.
               •   Victim has other serious injuries.
               •   Evidence of agent deposition on clothing or the skin.
      e.    Agent-Specific Decontamination Considerations. The type of agent released is a
critical factor in determining the decontamination practices to be used. Every situation will
have unique challenges, and responders must be flexible enough to adjust to the situation
with the resources available.
          (1) Chemical. A chemical agent can exist as a liquid, a solid, or a vapor,
depending on its physical properties. Liquids and solids are usually the only forms of
chemical agents that can be effectively removed from the skin.
                (a) It is generally not possible or necessary to decontaminate the skin
after chemical vapor exposure. However, chemical vapors can be trapped in clothing,
causing a continuing hazard. Therefore, clothing removal is the first step of
decontamination for a victim suspected of being exposed to either liquid or vapor chemical
agents.
                (b) Self-decontamination or emergency decontamination methods should
be initiated immediately for victims suspected of chemical contamination. More complex
field-expedient and thorough systems might provide more privacy, comfort, and
thoroughness in decontamination operations; however, they require additional setup time
and resources and may not be an initial decontamination option. These systems are
typically used to provide additional decontamination for victims that have gone through
self-decontamination or emergency decontamination and as precautionary measures for
chemical victims that are not symptomatic and do not have evidence of chemical
contamination.
               (c) It may be necessary to use multiple methods of decontamination,
depending on the amount of time and equipment required for setup and operation, the
number of victims that can be processed, and the thoroughness of the available
decontamination methods.
           (2) Biological. Biological agents typically have delayed symptoms and lack
easily recognizable signatures such as color or odor. There will rarely be an on-site incident
to respond to when a biological agent is released unless there is a dissemination warning, a
claimed or suspected dissemination device found, or a perpetrator caught in the act of
disseminating a biological agent.
                (a) Health care facilities are the most likely locations for managing a
biological agent incident. It is there that a biological incident would likely be recognized due
to an increasing number of patients presenting similar symptoms.




1 April 2008        FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                    V-5
                 (b) Medical treatment is the primary off-scene means of responding to a
biological agent incident. Decontamination using soap and warm water showers is
recommended, especially if patients have not washed themselves thoroughly since the
incident. If a biological incident is suspected, care must be taken to protect current hospital
patients, staff, and faculty from infection.
               (c) When biological decontamination is performed, thoroughness is more
important than speed. Biological agents are not typically a contact hazard, so removing the
agents from the skin is not as time-critical as when victims have been exposed to a chemical
agent. Immediate disrobing and emergency decontamination are only necessary for victims
who have other medical injuries that require immediate treatment.
           (3) Radiological. An explosion caused by a nuclear weapon or improvised
nuclear device (IND) would have devastating effects. However, nuclear materials are
extremely difficult to access, handle, and transport, making this a high-consequence, but
unlikely, threat.
                (a) A more likely incident would involve the dispersal of radioactive
materials using a radiological dispersal device (RDD) or "dirty bomb." This device typically
uses explosives or compressed gas to disperse radioactive materials over an area. An RDD
would not cause as many casualties as a well-orchestrated chemical or biological release;
however, it could cause traumatic injuries, contaminate large areas, and cause significant
psychological stress.
                 (b) Radiological materials have delayed medical effects and can take on
many forms, making them hard to recognize without special markings or the use of
detection equipment. Radiation detectors should be used to determine whether high levels
of radiological materials are present at an incident.
               (c) If radioactive materials are present, steps should be taken to contain
the hazard and minimize additional exposure. The RDD should be located and contained.
Victims should be moved away from the hazard and directed to an area for
decontamination.
                (d) Radiological decontamination minimizes the hazards of skin
contamination, reduces the risk of contaminants entering the body, helps contain
contamination, and reduces psychological stress. In radiological decontamination, victims
should be misted with water prior to disrobing to reduce the risk of inhaling or ingesting
radioactive particles.
                (e) Immediate disrobing and emergency decontamination are necessary
only for victims who have other medical conditions that require immediate treatment.
However, unlike biological agents, radioactive materials can pose an external hazard (from
outside the body) and should be removed from skin and clothing in a timely manner.
      f.   Decontamination Corridors.
           (1) Figure V-2 provides a general example of a decontamination corridor (the
warm zone is enlarged to provide a detailed view of the corridor). NFPA Standard 471
defines the decontamination corridor as the area, usually located within the warm zone,
where decontamination procedures take place. This is a controlled access area leading from
the hot zone (incident site) to the cold zone (support zone) in which decontamination
operations for the incident are conducted.



V-6              FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37               1 April 2008
                      Figure V-2. Decontamination Corridor Layout (Example)
           (2) The main points of a decontamination corridor are an entry point, an exit
point (vapor control line [VCL]), and an upwind direction of travel for personnel processing
through the decontamination corridor. The stations between the entry and exit points vary
with the type of decontamination corridor used. TTP for decontamination corridors can be
found in Appendix D.
      g.       Personnel Decontamination Procedures.
           (1) Emergency Decontamination. Emergency decontamination is a process that
 removes contamination from personnel in order to save lives, minimizes casualties, and
 limits the spread of the contamination. It also facilitates rapid medical attention without
 transferring the contamination to other personnel or equipment.
              (a) Decontaminants used are those that are safe for use on skin and 

 wounds. Basically, emergency decontamination directs mobile victims away from the 

 hazard. 

                (b) The process involves removing outer layers of clothing, removing any
 liquid agent from the skin, showering, checking victims visually, and (time permitting)
 conducting brief interviews. Figure V-3, page V-8, shows an example of an emergency
 decontamination layout.




1 April 2008        FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                  V-7
                 Figure V-3. Emergency Decontamination Layout (Example)
              (c) Following an incident, the IC may direct that the first
 decontamination measure taken be emergency decontamination. The rapid setup of
 emergency decontamination stations should help to minimize the number of casualties.
 See Appendix D for emergency decontamination procedures.
           (2) Technical Decontamination. Technical decontamination commonly refers to
 the deliberate decontamination of responders, response equipment, and evidence. It is
 conducted during a CBRN CM response where trained responders conduct
 decontamination operations. The focus of technical decontamination is neutralization of
 the agent. Terms that are commonly associated with technical decontamination are
 detailed, thorough, deliberate, definitive, and responder decontamination.
               (a) The incident may be accident- or terrorist-related and can involve
 CBRN hazards. Responders may be required to use supplied air respirators and
 fully-encapsulated, splash-resistant, protective suits.
                (b) Technical decontamination requires a step-by-step process, based on
 the hazards and risks involved, to reduce contamination on responders to a safe level and
 prevent the transfer of contamination outside the containment area. This consists of
 checking technical references to determine the hazards, such as flammability and toxicity,
 then evaluating the associated risks (for example, vapor versus liquid, blister versus nerve
 agents, radiological versus chemical-biological [CB] hazards).
               (c) In time sequencing, the establishment of technical decontamination
 may follow emergency decontamination. However, technical decontamination may also
 occur concurrent with emergency decontamination. In either case, no responder should be



V-8             FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37              1 April 2008
 allowed to enter the hot zone until some form of decontamination is established for the
 responders. For further information, see Appendix D and Multiservice Tactics, Techniques,
 and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Decontamination.
 Figure V-4 shows an example of a technical decontamination layout.




                  Figure V-4. Technical Decontamination Layout (Example)
           (3) Mass Casualty Decontamination. When a CBRN incident results in mass 

 casualties, MCD operations may be required. Because personnel processing through a 

 domestic MCD operation are not likely to have PPE, they require a fast, efficient, and 

 effective decontamination process. In addition to a rapid response, MCD operations 

 require large numbers of response personnel, equipment, and supplies. For information 

 concerning decontamination of human remains, refer to JP 4-06.

               (a) The operation may be performed by designated deployable units or by
members of the affected installation or activity, community, state, or nation. Responders
may include firefighters (DOD, local, state, and/or federal), medical personnel, logisticians,
engineers, security personnel, HN responders, or NGOs.
                (b) Even when expedient decontamination measures such as fire hoses
and nozzles are employed, the health and safety of the casualties must always be of the
utmost concern. Medical personnel monitor the casualties throughout the decontamination
process to ensure that the process causes no further injury. Contact information for all
personnel processing through the decontamination line should be maintained in the event
that follow-up action is necessary.
                (c) Upon arrival at the incident site, the designated decontamination unit
leader reports to the IC to receive instructions. The decontamination leader coordinates
communications and logistic requirements, and requests additional resources, as required.



1 April 2008     FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                      V-9
The leader receives specific guidance and establishes a decontamination site to conduct
operations. Responding DOD units/staffs may operate in support of civilian
decontamination efforts and provide assets that are not available in the community. The
leadership prepares a plan of action and—
               •     Conducts leader’s reconnaissance of the designated decontamination
site.
               •     Assigns specific assets to each site designated for setup.
               •     Updates the response mission statement and tasking based on new
information.
               •     Reconfigures equipment based on the updated mission statement.
              •     Conducts equipment checks and prepares to deploy to the
decontamination site.
               •     Deploys staff/unit to the decontamination site.
                •   Sustains the operation and begins to request support through liaisons
to the on-scene command or ICS.
              •    Establishes a plan to control any runoff or waste produced by the
decontamination operation.
               (d) Decontamination must be conducted as soon as possible to save lives.
First responders/firefighters should use any immediately available resources and start
decontamination as soon as possible. Since they may be able to bring large amounts of
water, the most expedient approach is to use currently available equipment to provide an
emergency low-pressure deluge. Used alone, water provides good decontamination;
however, adding soap can improve the removal of the contaminant.
                (e) Diluted sodium hypochlorite (bleach) solutions can aid in removal of
the agent, especially in the nonambulatory decontamination process. A 0.5% hypochlorite
solution can be used to decontaminate the litter, cutting devices, and other nonskin contact
areas. A soap and water solution is used on skin contact areas.
                (f) In time sequencing, the establishment of MCD will likely follow the
setup of emergency and technical decontamination. Emergency decontamination should be
completed by the time that MCD is established. However, technical decontamination in
support of responders should still be in operation. See Appendix D for detailed information
on MCD procedures. Figure V-5 shows an example of a casualty decontamination layout.




V-10            FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37              1 April 2008
                       Figure V-5. Casualty Decontamination Layout (Example)

               (4)   Patient Decontamination.
                 (a) Patient decontamination is similar to MCD; however, it commonly
 refers to the decontamination operations that occur at the patient decontamination site in
 the vicinity of the medical treatment facility (MTF). This type of operation is primarily
 conducted to protect the MTF from contamination. Patient decontamination follows all of
 the guidelines of MCD, but it may be a smaller operation that handles the persons who
 did not go through the MCD site and are presenting themselves to the MTF for medical
 treatment.
               (b) Patient decontamination is performed to ensure that patients are not
 admitted to the MTF until they are contamination-free. See Field Manual (FM) 4-02.7,
 Health Service Support in a Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Environment Tactics,
 Techniques, and Procedures, for patient decontamination procedures.
     h. Facility, Terrain, and Equipment Decontamination Procedures. CBRN CM
 decontamination operations may involve facility, terrain, or equipment contamination.
 Doctrine guidance is found in Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for
 Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Decontamination. Based on the highly
 specialized and technical nature of these decontamination requirements, DOD will likely
 support other United States Government technical response assets.




1 April 2008         FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37              V-11
3.     Health Service Support Recovery Operations
     a.   Definition. HSS recovery operations are a continuation of activities conducted
during the response phase of operations. During recovery operations, HSS units/staffs begin
phasing down operations and turning over their responsibilities to local, state, federal, or
HN medical responders.
      b.   Triage. Triage is the process of evaluating patients to place them in medical
treatment categories that determine the order in which they are treated. HSS personnel
triage casualties at the treatment/decontamination receiving area to determine if they
require decontamination before treatment or if they have life-threatening injuries that
require immediate lifesaving procedures. The ability to triage and treat victims before
decontamination may be limited because medical treatment personnel are in protective
clothing. Treatment prior to decontamination consists mainly of stabilizing and lifesaving
measures.
      c.   Receiving and Decontamination. A casualty receiving and decontamination
station should be established at the supporting MTF to ensure that all casualties entering
the MTF have been decontaminated. Some casualties may self-evacuate to the MTF, thus
bypassing the MCD lanes. Others may still have contamination on themselves or have
become recontaminated during the medical evacuation/transport process. Support
decontamination personnel and medical staff are required at this location. See FM 4-02.7,
Health Service Support in a Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Environment Tactics,
Techniques, and Procedures, for TTP on establishing an MTF casualty receiving and
decontamination station. See patient decontamination in Appendix D for additional
information.
       d.  Casualty Treatment. Initial treatment is provided by first responders such as
firefighters and EMS personnel or by a treatment team (triage, EMT, patient
decontamination, and evacuation personnel). The level of treatment depends on the type of
contamination, available decontamination assets, the number of casualties, the types of
available medical supplies, the number of available treatment personnel, the availability of
PPE for treatment personnel, and space allocated for the treatment site. Responders
remove the casualties from the contaminated area as quickly as possible, conduct
decontamination, and provide available antidotes and rapid EMT procedures.
      e.  Medical Evacuation. Responders must rapidly remove casualties from the
contaminated area in order to reduce agent effects. However, medical evacuation platforms
may quickly become overwhelmed during the response to a CBRN incident. As a result,
medical personnel must consider nontraditional modes of transportation, especially when
unprotected casualties are involved. The use of vehicles such as school buses, flatbed
trucks, and pickup trucks may be needed to efficiently move the patients to a
decontamination and treatment area; however, care must be exercised to contain the spread
of contamination. See FM 4-02.2, Medical Evacuation, FM 4-02.7, and FM 8-10-6, Medical
Evacuation in a Theater of Operations Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures, for additional
information.
      f.   Hospitalization. Hospitalization may be provided by service institutional MTFs
(such as United States Army Medical Department activities and medical centers; USAF
hospitals; and USN clinics, aid stations, and hospitals); operational medical treatment
units (deployable medical units); or local, state, federal, or HN facilities. Unique planning
considerations for hospitalization during CBRN CM are decontamination capabilities,


V-12             FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37               1 April 2008
specialty supplies and equipment, and medical reachback capabilities for special medical
conditions. Regardless of the type of MTF providing support, HSS personnel must provide―
      •        A patient receiving site adjacent to the facility with triage and decontamination
areas.
      •    Facility security to prevent contaminated individuals from entering the facility
before decontamination.
      •        Supplies and equipment for management and care of CBRN patients.
      g.   National Disaster Medical System (NDMS). Several DOD MTFs are designated
as federal coordinating centers (FCCs) in support of the NDMS and must develop MOUs
with the NDMS. In the event of a national disaster (such as a CBRN incident), the FCCs
coordinate with local, state, federal, and NDMS staffs on the management of disaster
victims. This coordination includes patient movement and definitive patient care functions.
See DODD 6000.12, Health Services Operations and Readiness; United States Army
Medical Command (USAMEDCOM) Pamphlet 525-1, Medical Emergency Management
Planning; and the National Disaster Medical System Federal Coordinating Center Guide for
the responsibilities of FCCs and DOD MTFs in the planning, exercise, and operation of a
local plan to receive and provide definitive care to casualties evacuated to the area as part
of the NDMS.
4.    Logistic Recovery Operations
      a.   Logistic planning must consider CBRN CM recovery and restoration actions.
Recovery operations are addressed in Appendix D. Further restoration may require
remediation of the actual site, and support during this phase of CBRN CM requires detailed
assistance that will likely be provided by other federal response assets (such as the EPA) or
the HN.
      b.    The restoration of a CBRN CM site places a logistic burden on all levels of
response. A site may require a large amount of time and resources before it can be used
again, if at all. An example of the length of time a CBRN CM action could take is the
cleanup of the Hart Senate Building and the Brentwood Mail Facility following the
deliberate release of anthrax. The cleanup took months, and large amounts of technical and
logistic support were required. Military resources may continue supporting recovery
operations such as clearance, facility, or terrain decontamination.
     c.    Decontamination of human remains to support mortuary affairs may be
required. See JP 4-06 for further guidance.
     d.    As the recovery phase progresses, the CBRN CM response assets begin to look
ahead and prepare for eventual redeployment. Representative issues that may occur
include the following:
     •     Identifying equipment or supplies that may have to be left at the incident site
because of contamination.
      •        Confirming load-planning configurations.
      •        Verifying the status of supply requisitions and ship-to addresses.
      •        Checking on the status of equipment awaiting repair.
      •        Updating records on the use of resources.


1 April 2008         FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                    V-13
5.     Transition Operations
     a.   Transition involves the transfer of responsibilities and functions to other
organizations. Termination or transition occurs when the mission has been accomplished or
when directed by the President or the Secretary of Defense.
     b.    DOD typically disengages from operations when the designated authorities no
longer require DOD support. This is generally when the immediate danger from the CBRN
incident is eliminated, the capabilities to save lives are in place, and critical services are
restored. DOD assets generally do not remain to conduct site recovery operations.
     c.    If DOD forces are transitioning functions between units, then the transition
requirements follow standard military handover procedures. If transition involves the
transfer of DOD force functions or areas to civil authorities or to local or HN agencies, the
transition will reflect operational procedures and existing agreements established by the
IC. A key factor is the transfer of any logs kept during the CM operation. Logs provide the
element assuming responsibilities a detailed picture of the events and actions that have
occurred. Rosters of all affected personnel and all responding personnel will be transferred
along with the logs, when appropriate.
     d.    A transition plan helps the staff identify transition issues in relation to the
desired or projected end state. It is especially important to identify the parties or agencies
that will accept functional responsibilities from the JTF commander. The transition plan
should identify organizations, operating procedures, and transition recommendations and
considerations. When implementing the transition plan, the transitioning parties should
discuss criteria for transferring operations. The plan should be unclassified, clear, and
concise—using terminology appropriate to all parties.
            (1) Transitioning may be accomplished by function or specific areas of the
incident site. The transition process should be event-driven and not tied to calendar dates.
Functions or areas transfer only when a similar capability becomes available or is no longer
needed. Procedures for the transfer of equipment or supplies—either between DOD units,
to civil authorities or to local or HN agencies—must be established according to regulation
and command guidance.
            (2) Planners identify other key transition factors within functional areas that
may include logistics, medical services, communications, security, and technical services.
Planners should develop a series of transition criteria to monitor progress. Well-chosen
indicators ensure that a consistent method is used to measure progress during the
transition.
6.     Redeployment Operations
     a.    Redeployment begins as soon as objectives are accomplished or the need for
military forces diminishes. Redeployment planning and operations follow normal military
guidelines and protocols. Careful consideration is given to identifying physical assets that
can be safely removed from the incident site and those that should be contained, controlled,
and/or left in place. Safety remains the primary concern.




V-14             FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                1 April 2008
     b.   During redeployment, the after-action review (AAR) process is used to help
evaluate mission and task performance. The AAR addresses the following:
      •   What was the original mission? How was it stated, and how was it interpreted at
the various levels of command?
      •        What should have happened (the mission or plan)?
      •        What actually happened (a description of events)?
      •        How did it happen (key facts that led up to the event)?
      •        Why did it happen (inferences about probable causes)?
      •        How can performance be improved next time (alternative COAs)?
     c.    During a response, incoming and outgoing data (questions and responses) should
be captured and archived so that personnel reviewing the data at a later date can be
confident that it is complete and accurate.
     d.    Following a response mission, the military response assets document lessons
learned, identify postoperation follow-up actions, and provide a copy of the AAR to the
applicable C2 headquarters. Key areas of documentation include personnel and equipment
expenditures or costs, incident event logs, and medical documentation for response
personnel.
     e.   Establishment of active lessons-learned collection activities within service
channels or established command channels will follow individual service or command
procedures.
     f.    Documentation of the incident occurs during the post-emergency period. Actions
that occurred during the notification, response, and recovery phases will be critical to
providing answers to questions that will be asked in areas such as fiscal or resource
management, MEDSURV, medical treatment, and mortuary affairs.
     g.   Accurate record keeping also facilitates monitoring of DOD response-element
personnel for long-term health problems that could be incident-related.
     h.   The following HSS considerations during redeployment operations should be
considered:
          (1) Ensuring that post-deployment health and risk communications debriefings
are provided to personnel who have returned or are returning from deployment.
          (2) Conducting long-term MEDSURV to detect latent diseases because
exposure to environmental health threats may have acute, chronic, or latent effects. Refer
to DOD 6055.5-M for more information.
          (3) Using health surveillance data to document any occurrence of disease or
health outcomes due to exposures, conducting epidemiological investigations, determining
new prevention strategies and countermeasures for current or future deployments, and
developing health risk communication materials.




1 April 2008         FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                V-15
         (4) Establishing guidance for archiving operational records to investigate
deployment health-related questions and concerns.
           (5) Providing face-to-face health assessment with a trained health care
provider for redeploying personnel who are required to complete a DD Form 2796, (Post-
Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA)). Scheduling medical and dental referrals and
follow-up visits for health concerns or issues.
           (6) Ensuring that Reserve Component (RC) members receive medical and
dental care and disability evaluations according to DODD 1241.01, Reserve Component
Medical Care and Incapacitation Pay For Line of Duty Conditions, prior to the member’s
release from active duty. Assisting in medical and dental care, plus necessary health
monitoring after release from the military, if the member will not remain on active duty.

                                                  Appendix A 

           PLANNING TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, AND PROCEDURES 


1.    Background
      The CBRN CM response unit plan provides the command guidance that the unit will
follow during CM response and recovery operations.
2.    Plan Development
      Services use various similar processes when developing a plan.
      a.       Figure A-1 is a sample checklist for conducting CBRN CM planning.

                   • Receive the mission.
                   • Conduct mission analysis.
                   • Analyze higher headquarters order.
                   • Conduct threat assessment.
                   • Conduct operational environment assessment.
                   • Determine specified, implied, and essential tasks (mission-to-task analysis).
                   • Conduct capabilities assessment.
                   • Conduct VA.
                   • Determine constraints.
                   • Identify facts and assumptions.
                   • Conduct risk assessment.
                   • Determine the initial commander’s critical information requirement (CCIR).
                   • Determine site survey requirements/conduct surveys (reconnaissance).
                   • Write a restated mission.
                   • Conduct a mission analysis briefing.
                   • Approve the restated mission.
                   • Develop the initial commander’s intent.
                   • Issue the commander’s guidance.
                   • Conduct COA development.
                   • Conduct COA analysis.
                   • Obtain COA approval.
                   • Produce a plan.

                            Figure A-1. Sample Plan Development Checklist




1 April 2008        FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                             A-1
     b.   The development of a comprehensive, integrated, and executable response plan is
the responsibility of the commander. Important points to consider when developing a CBRN
CM response plan include the following:
      •   Provide a clear and concise mission statement.
      •   Convey the commander’s intent.
      •   Focus on subordinate activities.
      •   Provide tasks, activities, constraints, and coordinating instructions.
     •     Include annexes/appendixes, if required, in order to expand the information not
readily incorporated in earlier text.
      •   Permit subordinate commanders to prepare supporting plans.
      •   Do not inhibit initiative.
     c.    The unit response plan format follows the standard OPLAN and five-paragraph
order format, yet it is tailored to meet the unique requirements of CBRN CM operations.
The basic steps taken in developing a unit response plan include the following:
          (1)   Gather and compile information.
           (2) Produce a summary and basic plan. The plan summary provides the reader
with a synopsis of the scope and purpose of the plan. The basic plan provides the
groundwork for all amplifying sections (annexes/appendixes) and is produced prior to its
documentation. The basic plan follows the five-paragraph order format and describes the
situation, plan for execution, commander’s intent, concept of operations (CONOPS), tasks,
coordinating instructions, administrative and logistics concepts, and C2 concepts.
            (3) Establish a plan of action, determine and assign responsibility for
developing annexes and appendixes, and assign task suspense dates for completion.
Annexes provide the details not readily incorporated into the basic plan; they are written to
increase clarity and usefulness of the basic plan. Annexes may address task organization,
logistics, intelligence, personnel, operations, and a multitude of CBRN CM-specific topics.
These are only required if deemed necessary. Each annex relates to a specific aspect of the
CBRN CM operations (such as MCD).
          (4) Coordinate development and review of the plan. Each service has published
guidance concerning deliberate planning, organization, and coordination of staff (FM 5-0,

           (5) Finalize the plan, and submit it to the commander for review and approval.
The finalized plan should be—
          •     Consistent with the organization/installation mission and responsibilities.
          •     Oriented on a tactical perspective.
          •     Adequately detailed to provide specific actions to be taken.
          •     Easily understood.
          •     Executed quickly and decisively, if required.
After the commander’s approval, the unit CBRN CM response plan becomes an OPORD.

      under task organization or in Annex A (Task Organization). Try to put all information in the task
      organization or in Annex A and state “See Task Organization” or “See Annex A.” However, when not in
      the task organization, list the assets that are attached or detached to the headquarters that issues the
      order. State when attachment or detachment is to be effective if different from when OPORD or OPLAN
      is effective.

                   (12) Other.
      2. MISSION.
      State the mission derived during the planning process. There are no subparagraphs in a mission
      statement which will also cover on-order missions. The mission statement should be short, concise, and
      focused on the efforts of the response unit (such as, By order of the commander ________ CBRN CM
      unit deploys NLT [time] ___________ to [location] ____________ to assess a potential hazard, advise
      the IC on CBRN-related aspects of CM, and facilitate the mobilization of additional military and federal
      assets to assist in CM in order to prevent loss of life, human suffering, and property damage).
      3. CONCEPT OF OPERATION.
              a. Commander’s intent. States the commander’s intent derived during the planning process,
      describes the commander’s vision of the operations, describes the purpose, visualizes the end state,
      and illustrates how the operation will facilitate future operations.
                   (1) Key tasks (IC objectives).
                   (2) Desired end state.
              b. CONOPS (general). The CONOPS may be a single paragraph, may be divided into two or
      more subparagraphs, or, if unusually lengthy, may be prepared as a separate annex. The CONOPS
      should be based on the COA statement from the decision-making process and, at a minimum, will
      provide sufficient detail to ensure understanding of the commander’s intent and purpose. It should
      specify the priority of support and the tasks allocated to the response unit. The concept describes⎯
                   •    The employment of the response unit.
                   •    The identification of any protection issues and its implementation.
                   •    The integration of other major organizations within the incident response system. These
       include active and reserve military forces that may be involved in incident mitigation.
                   •    Any other aspects of the operation that the commander considers appropriate to clarify
       the concept and to ensure unity of effort. If the integration and coordination are too lengthy for this
       paragraph, they are addressed in the appropriate annexes.
      When an operation involves two or more clearly distinct and separate phases, the CONOPS may be
      prepared in subparagraphs describing each phase. Designate phases as “Phase” followed by the
      appropriate Roman numeral, for example, Phase I.

      NOTE: Depending on what the commander considers appropriate, the level of command, and
      the complexity of any given operation, the following subparagraphs are examples of what may
      be required within the CONOPS.
              c. Reconnaissance and surveillance (R&S). This paragraph should specify the R&S plan and
      describe how it ties in with the basic CONOPS.
              d. Operations Security (OPSEC). The plan identifies on-scene security requirements.
              e. Environmental considerations. The plan should identify whether the incident site falls into a
      geographic area with unique environmental considerations (such as local population, industrial base, or
      soil composition).
              f. Coordinating instructions. List only instructions applicable to two or more units and not routinely
      covered in unit SOPs. This is always the last subparagraph in Paragraph 3. Complex instructions
      should be referred to in an annex. The following information should be included:
                • Time or condition when a plan or an order becomes effective.
                • CCIR. List priority intelligence requirements (PIRs), essential elements of friendly

           information, friendly force information requirements, and risk reduction control measures.

       1. SITUATION.
       a. Incident. The universal adversary (UA) built six spray dissemination devices and released Sarin (GB)
       vapors into the ventilation systems of three large commercial office buildings in downtown Birmingham,
       Alabama. In addition, some of the agent exited through rooftop ventilation stacks, creating a downwind
       hazard. Sarin is a human-made chemical warfare agent (CWA) classified as a nerve agent. Nerve agents
       are the most toxic and rapidly acting of the known CWAs. Sarin is a clear, colorless, and tasteless liquid
       that has no odor in its pure form. However, Sarin can evaporate into a vapor and spread into the
       environment.

     b. Victim information. The agent killed 95% of the people in the buildings and killed or injured many of the
     responders. Injured personnel showed various signs of miosis (constriction of the pupils), headaches,
     runny nose, salivation, tightness in the chest, nausea, vomiting, giddiness, anxiety, muscle twitches,
     weakness, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and involuntary urination and defecation.
     c. Environment.
           (1) Terrain. Urban environment.
           (2) Weather (next 12 hours).
                  •     Temperature. 65 degrees Fahrenheit.
                  •     Humidity/precipitation. 64 percent/10 percent.
                  •     Barometric pressure. 29.82 inches and rising.
                  •     Wind speed. 11 miles per hour.
                  •     Wind direction. From the Southwest.
                  •     Cloud cover. 25 percent.
                  •     Pertinent light data. Sunrise at 0652 hours and sunset at 1653 hours.
               (3) Civil considerations. Fatalities and major injuries have occurred due to falling and crushing
               during the panic on the street and due to vehicle accidents. There is little direct damage due to the
               attack except that the building interiors and contents are highly contaminated by agent condensing
               on the surfaces. The three buildings and its contents will be a total loss due to decontamination
               measures and/or psychological impacts of future usability. However, airing and washing should
               decontaminate adjacent structures adequately. Overwhelming demand has disrupted
               communications (landline telephone and cellular) in the local area. There are large numbers of
               “worried well” personnel overwhelming the medical system. Loss of three fire crews and three EMS
               crews will impact readiness for other events in the short term.
               (4) Threat. Sarin liquid and vapor contamination within the three buildings and downwind vapor
               hazard traveling northeast from the incident site for approximately 1,200 meters. Identification of a
               secondary device has not yet been determined. The UA has not yet been determined.
        d. Supported agencies. The supported agencies are the local and county emergency response assets
        to include the fire services, law enforcement, EMS, and emergency management agencies.
        e. Incident command.
               (1) The incident is being managed by a single incident command. Supporting military assets will
               remain under the C2 of the DOD.
               (2) The IC is the Birmingham Metropolitan Fire Chief. Military supporting units should report to the
               ICP upon arrival at the incident area for further instructions.
        f. Response Assets. Contact information for the available response assets can be requested at the
        ICP. The following assets are available to assist in the response operation.
               (1) HAZMAT. Local and county HAZMAT response teams.
               (2) Decontamination. Local and county HAZMAT response teams and supporting military chemical
               decontamination units.
               (3) EMS. Local and county EMS.
               (4) Fire services. Local and county fire services.
               (5) Law enforcement. Local, county, and state law enforcement.

              (6) Hospitals. Local and county hospitals.
              (7) State agencies. Emergency management agencies.
              (8) Federal agencies. FEMA, DHS, and DOD.
              (9) PVO’s. Red Cross.
       g. Assumptions. Each building is assumed to have occupancy of 2,000 personnel, and the outdoor
       population density of the surrounding areas is 3,900 people per square mile. Evacuation and/or sheltering
       of downwind populations will be required. Tens of thousands of people will require monitoring and
       decontamination as they are allowed to leave their buildings. Hundreds will require hospital treatment.
       Anything exposed to a high-vapor agent concentration will require decontamination, including bodies.
       However, decontamination of some materials may be difficult or impossible. Even if structures and property
       could be decontaminated, the psychological impact on future usability would be significant.
       2. MISSION.
       The 1007th Regional Readiness Command will deploy chemical decontamination assets to support
       emergency and MCD operations. All 1007th assets will provide support to the IC. Decontamination assets
       will advise the IC on all aspects of the decontamination operation to assist in the evacuation of chemical
       casualties to EMS/facilities. Decontamination assets will advise the IC on infrastructure contamination
       containment and/or decontamination aspects once casualties have been evacuated. The 1007th will
       deploy chemical reconnaissance assets to assist in casualty extraction at the incident site. Chemical
       reconnaissance assets will advise the IC on all aspects of casualty extraction. The 1007th will deploy area
       medical support assets, with clinical operational equipment set, to assist with medical treatment of
       chemical casualties at the incident site. HSS assets will advise the IC on all aspects of casualty treatment.
       All 1007th assets will prepare for redeployment and recovery operations upon notification that support is no
       longer required and higher headquarters has approved redeployment.
       3. EXECUTION.

           (6) Rehearsals/inspections. The supporting unit command will ensure that PCC/PCI and premission
           rehearsals are conducted prior to deployment.
           (7) Safety briefing. A complete safety briefing will be conducted prior to any element departing to the
           incident area.
           (8) Civilian resources. Identify civilian jurisdictions and their response resources.
     4. SERVICE SUPPORT.
        a. Materiel. All supporting units will deploy with a minimum of 72 hours of its basic load for all classes of
        supply. Class V (ammunition) will be distributed according to the established ROE.
        b. Services. Essential services to sustain operations past 72 hours will be coordinated, as required, at
        the incident site.
        c. Health service support. Medical support for 1007th personnel will be provided internally by the 

        deploying combat support hospital. 

        d. Personnel. Administrative requirements will be coordinated through unit administrative personnel, as
        necessary.
     5. COMMAND AND SIGNAL.
        a. Command. The IC will be in command of the incident. The senior military official on site will be in
        charge of all DOD assets supporting the IC. A military liaison will coordinate support operations
        between the IC and the supporting military units.
        b. Signal.
            (1) Internal. Current signal operating instructions are in effect.
           (2) External. Direct liaison authorized with the IC.
            (3) Forms. Operational forms used during incident response should meet the intent of the example

  Figure A-3. Unit CBRN Consequence Management Operation Order (Example) (Continued)




1 April 2008         FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                                            A-13
5.     Department of Defense Consequence Management Assets
      The following paragraphs identify representative military assets/units with
capabilities that could be tasked to support a CBRN CM incident. A more comprehensive
listing of military capabilities, assets, and units for CBRN CM operations can be found in
CJCSI 3110.16A.
       a.   United States Air Force.
            (1)   Air Force Radiation Assessment Team (AFRAT).
                  (a) The AFRAT is a globally responsive, specialty asset team that
provides health physics and radiological support in response to radiation incidents and
accidents. The team provides field radioanalytical support to the assigned theater medical
authority. It measures, analyzes, and interprets environmental and occupational samples
for its radioactivity content, providing expert guidance on the type and degree of
radiological hazards that face deployed forces.
                (b) The AFRAT will perform radioanalytical analysis on environmental
samples (such as swipes, soil, water, air, and foodstuffs) and occupational samples (such as
the whole body, breath, urine, and feces). Analysis results are interpreted for the impact on
deployed forces and noncombatants. The information is compiled for use by the medical
authority on dose avoidance, dose reduction, and dose assessment; risk of communication;
and additional requirements for effective CBRN CM.
            (2)   Theater Epidemiology Team (TET).
                (a) The TET provides threat assessments of environmental and
occupational factors, evaluates infectious disease risks, and DNBI rates from all sources
and recommends interventions to minimize degradation of mission staff. These tasks are
accomplished as part of the initial site or theater assessment and during ongoing operations
and disease and environmental health threat assessments.
                 (b) The TET is a light, mobile, multidisciplinary team with limited
environmental and occupational sampling equipment. It has a portable high-end computing
capability and uses a communications infrastructure that allows for theater-wide data
collection and coordination with the JTF.
           (3) USAF EOD. The USAF EOD forces locate, identify, disarm, neutralize,
recover, and dispose of hazardous explosives; chemical, biological, incendiary, and nuclear
ordnance; and criminal and terrorist IEDs. The highly mobile teams can deploy anywhere
in the United States within 24 hours.
            (4) USAF CBRN CM Assets. The USAF maintains unit type codes (UTCs)
capable of supporting CM and specific CBRNE response capabilities. These UTCs are
available for CM response as tasked by authorities at the installation level, up to and
including COCOMs. Civil engineer (CE) Readiness serves the USAF as the CBRN experts
for the Service. As such, their support includes providing technical advice and response
team management, conducting CBRN detection planning, establishing a threat detection
grid, and performing active and passive CBRN detection via established detection tools and
networks. CE Readiness defines the initial contamination footprint to include declaring
contamination control areas (CCAs) contamination-free and establishing an initial hazard
perimeter. Additionally, CE Readiness performs initial CBRN identification as part of
initial detection operations and conducts planning, sampling, and analysis to identify


A-14              FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37             1 April 2008
CBRN materials in support of operational risk assessment. These experts gather CBRN
hazard concentration data and establish a COP while providing CBRN hazard
concentration readings from chemicals, leading active and passive monitoring to shape
hazard footprints, and conducting hazard monitoring in CCA and CCS. They advise
decontamination teams on CBRN decontamination after the attack and support HAZMAT
decontamination operations. CE Readiness supports the bioenvironmental engineer (BEE)
in collecting samples from an incident site—including packaging, preserving, and
transporting—and supports CE in development of the CWA section of the hazardous waste
collection and disposal plan. Additionally, professional CE Readiness technicians advise
commanders on MOPP decisions; plan and execute hazard modeling, plotting, and
reporting; and establish a CBRN warning and reporting network. Experts in this specialty
provide isolation zones, hazard areas plotting, responder safe routes, protective action
zones, and split MOPP zone status and direct CBRN reconnaissance while coordinating
with bioenvironmental teams for the appropriate downwind hazard area and evacuation
planning. Representative capabilities are as follows:
                 (a) UTC 4F9DA, EM CBRN Defense 1200 Team. This team provides
limited response to the full-spectrum of physical threats, to include the CBRN control
center (CBRNCC) and CM supporting activities throughout the full range of military
operations to major theater war (MTW) and response to major accidents and natural
disasters. Capabilities and assets include preliminary risk/vulnerability assessments and
threat analysis; planning, detection, identification, warning, and reporting; expedient and
operational decontamination operations; disaster response equipment; technical data; roll-
on/roll-off capability; and pallets.
                 (b) UTC 4F9DB, EN CBRN Defense 600 Team. This team provides
minimal full-spectrum threat response, to include CBRNCC and WMD defense supporting
activities (ranging from smaller-scale contingency operations to MTW) and response to
major accidents and natural disasters. Capabilities and assets include preliminary
risk/vulnerability assessments and threat analysis; planning, detection, identification,
warning, and reporting; decontamination; contamination control area; and disaster
response equipment; technical data; roll-on/roll-off capability; and pallets.
                (c) First responders, as defined by the Air Force Incident Management
System (AFIMS), are members of the Disaster Response Force (DRF)—elements that
deploy immediately to the disaster scene to provide initial C2, save lives, and suppress and
control hazards. Firefighters, law enforcement and security personnel, and key emergency
medical personnel provide the initial, immediate response to major accidents, natural
disasters, and CBRNE incidents. All first responders are emergency responders, but not all
emergency responders are first responders.
                 (d) Emergency responders, as defined by AFIMS, are members of the DRF
response elements that deploy after the first responders to expand C2 and provide
additional support. Emergency responders include follow-on firefighters, law enforcement
personnel, security personnel, and emergency medical technicians, as well as emergency
management and operations (civil engineer readiness specialty) personnel, EOD personnel,
physicians, nurses, medical treatment providers at medical treatment facilities, public
health officers, BEEs, mortuary affairs personnel, and other specialized team members.
              (e) Headquarters, Air Combat Command (ACC), maintains and ensures
that the ACC Response Task Force (RTF) is equipped and trained for response to



1 April 2008    FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                    A-15
radiological incidents or accidents other than for Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM)
assets within the continental United States (CONUS), Puerto Rico, or U.S. Virgin Islands.
                (f)   Headquarters, Air Mobility Command (AMC), provides airlift, air
refueling, and air mobility support operations in a CBRNE threat environment and
provides airborne survey platforms for the Department of Energy observation over areas
affected by a nuclear weapons accident. Additionally, AMC serves as lead major command
to decontaminate large frame aircraft and handle contaminated cargo and provides
resources for CBRNE casualty aeromedical evacuation.
                (g) Headquarters, Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), maintains,
equips, and trains the AFSPC RTF for ICBM radiological incidents or accidents involving
USAF-owned ICBM assets. The AFSPC also develops and implements AFSPC Plan 10-1,
ICBM Radiological Accident/Incident Response and Recovery Plan, and provides RTF
response to incidents involving ICBM and other applicable assets.
                (h) Headquarters, United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE),
maintains, equips, and trains the USAFE RTF for radiological incidents or accidents within
the United States European Command (USEUCOM) AOR and provides RTF response to
incidents within the USEUCOM AOR.
               (i)   Air National Guard (ANG) assets in the Joint Task Force-Civil
Support (JTF-CS) plans and integrates DOD support to the designated primary agency for
CBRNE incident management operations through the supported combatant command
(COCOM) DCO. ANG/JTF-CS deploys to the incident site, establishes C2 of designated
DOD forces, and provides military assistance to the primary agency for CBRNE events.
ANG/JTF-CS must be requested by the primary agency, authorized by the Secretary of
Defense, and directed by the United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) to
respond. ANG/JTF-CS serves as USNORTHCOM’s primary interface with the
environmental radiation ambient monitoring system, the Rapid Response Information
System, and the Unified Command Suite during CBRNE events.
                 (j)   The ANG assets in the WMD-CST deploy rapidly, assist local first
responders in determining the precise nature of an incident, provide expert medical and
technical advice, and help pave the way for the identification and arrival of follow-on
military support. Unless federalized, the ANG CSTs will remain state National Guard
assets that can be quickly accessed by proximate governors. The ANG CST mission is to
assess a suspected WMD attack, advise civilian responders on appropriate actions, and
facilitate the arrival of additional state and federal military forces. Each team consists of 22
full-time ANG and ARNG personnel and is broken down into six smaller teams—command,
operations, communications, administration and logistics, medical, and survey—that have
been trained and equipped to provide a technical capability to reachback to other experts
who can assist the IC. In essence, these "scouts" are a unique military capability. They can
deploy rapidly to a suspected or actual terrorist attack, conduct special reconnaissance to
determine the effects of the attack, provide situational understanding to military command
channels, provide technical consultation to local authorities on managing the effects of the
attack to minimize the impact on the civilian population, and facilitate follow-on military
support performing validated civilian requests for assistance.
             (k) Headquarters, Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA),
supports CBRNE incidents through the Headquarters, AFCESA CE Readiness Operations
Center.


A-16             FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                1 April 2008
                 (l) The Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) ensures that installation
weather squadrons can provide weather data for CBRN material dispersion models,
including toxic industrial chemical (TIC) or TIM assessments, and ensures that operational
weather squadrons provide the meteorological information necessary to produce chemical
downwind messages and effective downwind messages for radiological fallout.
              (m)    The Air Force BEE may assume incident command for recovery
operations where a health risk assessment is the primary mission and support incident
command throughout a CBRN event. The BEE supports CE Readiness with active and
passive CBRN detection and contamination footprint definition and hazard location when
additional manpower or equipment is required or requested; conducts planning, sampling,
and analysis operations to identify CBRN materials and pathogens in support of a health
risk assessment and health hazard control, but not for risk assessment; performs
presumptive CBRN agent identification; and quantifies CBRN materials, pathogens, and
hazardous conditions to support health risk assessment and health hazard control. The
BEE also conducts active and passive monitoring to determine contamination extent,
hazard condition changes, and personnel dose estimates to support health risk assessment
and health hazard control; collects samples from the incident site including packaging,
preserving, and transporting to support health risk assessment and health hazard control
with CE Readiness assistance; supports waste disposal through health risk assessment and
health hazard control to maximize force health protection; evaluates and certifies PPE
planned for use in any HAZMAT operation; and provides health risk assessment to support
MOPP reduction in collaboration with CE Readiness before providing recommendation to
command authority.
                (n) Additional assets are available from the Air Force medical service
through expeditionary UTCs and home station response teams. Capabilities cover the range
of medical services from the smallest (a preventive aerospace medical [PAM] team
consisting of an aerospace medicine physician, BEE, public health officer, and an
independent duty medical technician) to the largest (an expeditionary medical support
[EMEDS] +25, a modular, scalable, rapid response medical package with surgical capability
and the capacity to care for 25 inpatients) facilities. In between are teams designed to
decontaminate patients, collect environmental samples, conduct epidemiology
investigations, and dispense pharmaceuticals to the masses. See Air Force instruction (AFI)
41- and 48-series publications for additional information on USAF medical CBRN CM
capabilities.
      b.       United States Army.
          (1) United States Army Chemical Corps. The United States Army Chemical
Corps provides CBRN CM capabilities throughout the force with CBRN units from
company to brigade levels, staff expertise from company to theater Army levels, specialized
staff augmentation elements, and specialized units that include CBRN reconnaissance,
decontamination, and technical escort capabilities.
            (2) CBRNE Operational Headquarters. The CBRNE Operational Headquarters
is an organization primarily focused on conducting WMD-Elimination operations in support
of CCDRs. The 20th Support Command (CBRNE), a FORSCOM unit, is the only existing
organization of this type. The 20th Support Command provides support for CM as a force
provider of CBRN and EOD assets to support CM operations and to provide technical
advice and support through technical reachback capabilities to national assets. It also



1 April 2008        FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37               A-17
includes small-scale technical teams to conduct sampling, detection, monitoring, and
analytical support to the IC.
           (3) Army Service Component Commands (ASCC). ASCCs support CM
assessment, planning, preparation, and execution activities in support of geographic
CCDRs within respective assigned AORs. The United States Army North (USARNORTH)
provides a representative illustration of an ASCC support to CM in the domestic
operational environment as follows:
               (a) The purpose of USARNORTH is to save lives, prevent injury, and
provide temporary critical life support during a CBRNE situation within the
USNORTHCOM AO. USARNORTH is the ASCC for USNORTHCOM providing Homeland
Defense and DSCA, including CBRN CM operations.
                 (b) Established in September 2005, USARNORTH is comprised of Active
Army, United States Army Reserve (USAR), and ARNG members, as well as civilian
personnel. It is commanded by an Active Army three-star general officer.
               (c) USARNORTH is capable of deploying two operational CPs, each
commanded by a two-star general officer, and able to conduct operations as a JTF or Joint
Force Land Component Command and staff with augmentation. The commander exercises
OPCON of all federal DOD resources (not including United States Special Forces Command
and United States Army Corps of Engineers®) committed to providing DSCA, provides
LNOs to appropriate civil agencies, and receives LNOs from appropriate military
commands and agencies.
                (d) USARNORTH maintains DCOs with defense coordinating elements in
each of the ten FEMA regions to plan, coordinate, and integrate DSCA with local, state, and
federal agencies.
                 (e) USARNORTH accomplishes its CBRN CM mission in strict adherence of
public law and DOD policies. Deployment of USARNORTH, at the direction of the
USNORTHCOM commander and on the authority of the Secretary of Defense, occurs only
after a governor requests federal assistance from the President, and after the President
issues a Presidential Disaster Declaration. In any DSCA setting, USARNORTH remains in
support of the lead federal agency throughout the CBRN CM operation.
          (4)   Area Medical Laboratory (AML).
             (a)     The AML provides confirmatory analysis and long-term CM of
CBRNE incidents.
                 (b) The AML, on order, deploys worldwide in tailored teams to conduct
health threat detection, confirmation, and medical surveillance for CBRNE occupational
and environmental health, endemic diseases, and CM to protect and sustain the health of
the force across the full spectrum of military operations.
          (5)   Medical Chemical Biological Advisory Team (MCBAT).
                 (a) The MCBAT is the primary source of medical information dealing with
the management of CWA casualties for the federal government. Through the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or agencies within the Department of Health and Human
Services, the team provides consultation to state, city, or local agencies. As necessary, they
supervise the collection of biological samples (body fluids) for subsequent verification of



A-18             FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37              1 April 2008
chemical agent exposure that can be used to facilitate the confirmation, diagnosis, and
treatment of casualties.
              (b) The MCBAT is staffed by technical experts from the United States
Army Medical Research Institute for Chemical Defense (USAMRICD) and the United
States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). The MCBAT
provides—
                   •   Input into the development of operating procedures.
                   •   Training in the management of chemical agent casualties.
              •   Clinical advice and consultation in matters related to the initial and
long-term management of chemical agent casualties.
                 •    Essential medical information during the recovery phase of the
operation for the safe return to normal activities.
                   •   On-site training for medical professionals on the management of CB
casualties.
            (6) Special Medical Augmentation Response Teams (SMARTs). The United
States Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) and its subordinate commands organize, man,
and equip the SMARTs. SMARTs are task-organized as temporary organizations from
existing medical activities. These teams provide MSCA during disasters, civil-military
operations, and humanitarian and emergency services incidents occurring in the United
States, its territories and possessions, and outside the continental United States
(OCONUS) UC AORs. The following functional SMARTs have been established:
               •   SMART–Emergency Medical Response (SMART-EMR).
               •   SMART–Chemical/Biological/Radiological/Nuclear (SMART-CBRN).
               •   SMART–Stress Management (SMART-SM).
        •   SMART–Medical Command, Control, Communications, and Telemedicine
(SMART-MC3T).
               •   SMART–Pastoral Care (SMART-PC).
               •   SMART–Preventive Medicine/Disease Surveillance (SMART-PM).
               •   SMART–Burn (SMART-B).
               •   SMART–Veterinary (SMART-V).
               •   SMART–Health Systems Assessment and Assistance (SMART-HS).
               •   SMART–Aeromedical Isolation (SMART-AI).
               •   SMART–Logistics (SMART-LOG).
               •   SMART–Smallpox Emergency Response (SMART-SER).
               •   SMART–Smallpox Specialized Treatment (SMART-SST).
               •   SMART–Investigational New Drug (SMART-IND).
               •   SMART–Radiological Advisory Medical (SMART-RAM).




1 April 2008       FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                   A-19
Additional functional teams are being organized and will be manned and equipped in the
near future. For detailed information on the SMARTs, refer to MEDCOM Pamphlet 525-1.
          (7) United States Army Reserve Command. The USARC maintains RC
multifunction CBRN companies with a specified domestic reconnaissance, casualty
decontamination (DRCD) mission for DCM during civil support operations.
                (a) These units are designed for overseas deployment, but may also be
tasked by the Secretary of Defense to provide domestic CBRN CM support. These units are
not designed or intended to replace functions carried out under the ICS or to replace those
functions normally performed by the emergency responder community, but rather provide
additional capability as needed.
                (b) These units are not designed for a rapid response, but can be mobilized
and deployed within days. Its support is requested through the implementation of DSCA
policies and processes. These units are best employed by pre-positioning them in
preparation for high-threat, high-visibility events (such as the Olympic Games).
                (c) DRCD-designated CBRN companies within the USARC are equipped
with platoon sets of CBRN detection and identification equipment to support CBRN CM
assessment activities, with specialized MCD equipment sets to support both ambulatory
and nonambulatory casualties.
       c.   United States Marine Corps.
            (1) USMC Chemical-Biological Incident Response Force. The CBIRF was
created in 1996 to respond to terrorist attacks or other attacks from WMDs. Prior to the
unit’s activation, the federal government did not have a coherent response capability for
CBRNE that could holistically provide detection, identification, extraction, mass
decontamination, and medical triage. This single-source concept was initiated by General
Charles C. Krulak, Commandant of the Marine Corps, and The Honorable Richard Danzig,
Secretary of the Navy, in response to Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 39, U.S. Policy
on Counterterrorism, and PDD 62, Combating Terrorism.
                 (a) The CBIRF is a battalion-size unit of nearly 500 Marines and Sailors
comprised of more than four dozen military occupational specialties (MOSs) and capable of
performing a broad range of CM tasks. Due to the nature of the WMD threat, the CBIRF
has to be prepared 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to respond to a sudden attack or
incident. CBIRF maintains a standing operational task-organized force, known as the
Initial Response Force (IRF). The IRF is a task-organized, trained, standing reaction force
comprised of approximately 131 CBIRF personnel. It is manned and equipped to provide
the full range of initial response capabilities for contaminated environment operations to
include C2, agent detection and identification, casualty extraction, extrication, emergency
medical care and stabilization, limited EOD capability, response force and casualty
decontamination, and internal organic protection. This force is logistically self-sustained
and prepared to integrate into either the civilian incident or UC system or as part of a DOD
JTF. Upon deployment of the first IRF, the CBIRF will immediately stand up its second
IRF. Within 6 hours, this force will be ready to either act as a follow-on force for the first
IRF and/or as an independent response force for another incident.
               (b) The II Marine Expeditionary Forces (IIMEF) retain OPCON of CBIRF
and remain the USMC’s POC for the request for forces (RFF) process used to request the
commitment of CBIRF personnel. RFFs flow from the President to the Secretary of Defense


A-20             FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37              1 April 2008
through the Joint Forces Command (JFCOM). Approved requests for CBIRF participation
are assigned by the JFCOM to Marine Forces Command and IIMEF for action and to the
CBIRF commander for execution. Additionally, the CBIRF is often tasked to pre-position
forces in support of specific NSSEs designated by the United States Secret Service.
Although it is generally believed that the CBIRF directly supports the Joint Task Force
National Capital Region, the CBIRF may be (and has been) tasked to support missions
within CONUS outside of the NCR and OCONUS.
                  (c) Mission. The CBIRF’s mission statement is as follows: “When directed,
forward deploy and/or respond to a credible threat of a CBRNE incident in order to assist
local, state, or federal agencies and Unified Combat Commanders in the conduct of
consequence management operations. CBIRF accomplishes this mission by providing
capabilities for agent detection and identification; casualty search, rescue, and personnel
decontamination; and emergency medical care and stabilization of contaminated
personnel.” Additional planning considerations include the following:
                    •   CBIRF, either on its own or in conjunction with other DOD assets
such as the USMC National Guard WMD-CST, CERFP, or Coast Guard strike teams will
detect and identify CBRN agents and/or substances, assess the potential effects of the
WMD incident, advise local authorities on managing the effects of the attack, and assist
with appropriate requests for additional support to minimize the impact on the civilian
populace.

                     •   CBIRF has the ability to locate and extract victims from a
contaminated environment, perform medical triage and treatment in contaminated
environments, and perform mass patient/casualty decontamination to support civil first
responders or military authorities. In a general-tiered response scenario, WMD-CST,
USMC National Guard CERFP, and CBIRF capabilities would be complementary and
completely interoperable with civilian responders according to the NIMS, using the ICS.
Identified in the WMD CM Functional Needs Analysis as a “dual purpose” unit because of
its worldwide deployment status, CBIRF is also capable of deploying in support of a foreign
CM incident, enabling it to augment a Joint force commander, DOS officials, or other U.S.
or non-U.S. agencies as directed. To accomplish these tasks, CBIRF personnel receive
specialized training in HAZMAT operations, PPE, and additional training in the technical
aspects of performing their regular duties as well as their specialized duties in hazardous
environments.
               (d) Capabilities. The CBIRF includes a complete WMD CM response
package and remains the only single-source DOD unit capable of providing all C2 and
supporting elements required for a CBRN CM incident—foreign or domestic. When
required, the CBIRF has a second IRF that can deploy and operate independently, or
augment the first IRF for sustained operations. Each of the IRFs provides the following
capabilities:
                     •   Detection and identification of all known CW agents, many
biological agents, and more than 200,000 TICs and TIMs.
                  •    Casualty search and extraction with more than 150 Emergency
Medical Technician–Basic trained Marines able to operate in PPE at levels A through C.

rescue qualified Marines.
                      •      Ten EOD Marines capable of operating in full PPE.
          (2)   Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) CBRN CM Assessment Set.
                 (a) Purpose. MAGTFs require CBRN detection, identification, and
protective equipment that exceeds those required for defense against traditional CBRN
threats and allows monitor/survey and reconnaissance operations in the most hazardous of
environments. The MAGTF CBRN CM set is a suite of specialized CBRN detection,
identification, and protective equipment that will be used by MAGTF CBRN defense
officers and specialists with MOS 5702 and MOS 5711 and other trained personnel to
support the MAGTF commanders in CBRN CM and TIM assessment operations.
                (b) Mission. The MAGTF CBRN set of equipment will increase the
MAGTF commander's CBRN monitor/survey and reconnaissance capability by permitting
operations into known and unknown environments and providing an increased CBRN and
TIM detection and identification capability.
                 (c) System Description. The MAGTF CBRN set provides a CBRN
detection and force health protection capability to the MAGTF commander that allows
detection, identification, and sampling of CBRN agents and TIMs, as well as protection for
CBRN reconnaissance elements in known and unknown environments. Equipment required
for this capability is a mixture of current organic and current COTS equipment.
                (d)       MAGTF CBRN CM set teams consist of the following:
                      •      3 x 4-man reconnaissance teams.
                      •      Hot-zone controller.
                      •      Cold-zone controller.
                      •      On-scene commander.
                (e)   Additional support required:
                      •      Security.
                      •      Decontamination.
                      •      Communications.
                      •      Administrative assistance.
                      •      Medical.
                      •      EOD.
                 (f)  Methods of Employment. The MAGTF commander must have the
capability to conduct monitor/survey and reconnaissance operations against all potential
CBRN and TIM hazards. MAGTF CBRN CM teams are employed in a mature operational
environment to perform reconnaissance of known or unknown CBRN threats at the major
subordinate command (MSC) level or higher, as determined by the MAGTF commander.
These teams may be employed in general support of other organizations or in direct support

of the parent organization. Employment of equipment will be according to unit SOPs as
guided by 29 CFR 1910.120.
      d.       United States Navy.
          (1) Navy Forward Deployed Preventive Medicine Unit (FDPMU). Through its
rapidly deployable CBRN environmental defense response teams, the FDPMU provides
assessment, identification, and mitigation of near- and long-term health effects and the
consequences of disease from the public health aspect. Response teams augment the Naval
Medical Research Center (NMRC) field laboratory on-site.
           (2) Defense Technical Response Group (DTRG). The DTRG can provide
assistance with nuclear and IND EOD.
           (3) Office of Naval Research (ONR) and Naval Research Laboratory (NRL).
NRL assets are arrayed strategically at CONUS locations and conduct broad-based,
multidisciplinary research. The ONR and NRL are available to rapidly deploy uniformed
experts in microbiology who are trained in CB threat agents to support field investigations.
     e.   National Guard Bureau (NGB). The NGB maintains CBRNE-capable forces that
are under state government control according to Title 32 USC, but may be federalized to
respond to CBRNE incidents under Title 10 USC. These forces include—
           (1) Weapons of Mass Destruction-Civil Support Teams. The WMD-CSTs consist
of both ARNG and ANG personnel, and are designated to provide a specialized capability in
response to a CBRN incident primarily within Title 32 USC operations status within the
United States and its territories, as established by Title 10 USC. Responding under the
authority of the governor, they support civil authorities in a domestic CBRN incident site
by identifying CBRN agents, assessing current and projected consequences, advising on
response measures, and assisting with appropriate requests for additional support. The
WMD-CSTs may also be federalized and deployed as a part of a federal response to an
incident within or outside the WMD-CST's assigned state. See FM 3-11.22, Weapons of
Mass Destruction Civil Support Team Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures, for more
information.
           (2) National Guard Response Force (NGRF). NGRFs provide every state with a
ready combat arms force capable of delivering a company-size security element at the
request of the governor or the President. The NGRF may assist local and state law
enforcement officials by protecting key sites or facilities, performing traffic control duties,
and conducting cold-zone security operations at a CBRN incident site.
           (3) CBRNE Emergency Response Force Package. The CERFP is a battalion-size
task force tailored with existing ARNG units that are mobilized under Title 32 USC to
provide a regional response in the event of a CBRNE incident. The CERFP follows WMD­
CST and NGRF capabilities during the immediate and reinforcing response phases of the
response spectrum. The CERFP deploys to CBRNE incident sites to provide civil support to
ICs by conducting CM operations to save lives and prevent human suffering. The CERFP is
typically task-organized as a task force that includes a battalion-level command and staff
for C2, a company-size medical capability for triage and stabilization (such as an ANG
medical group), a table of organization and equipment (TOE) CBRN company to provide
casualty decontamination, and a TOE engineer company for casualty search and extraction.
The CERFP units maintain additional specialized equipment and receive specialized
training to perform safe operations in a CBRN environment.

       f.   Other DOD CM Support Activities.
            (1)   Joint Task Force–Civil Support.
                (a) The purpose of JTF-CS is to save lives, prevent injury, and provide
temporary critical life support during a CBRNE incident in the United States or its
territories and possessions. JTF-CS is the only military organization dedicated solely to
planning and integrating DOD forces for CBRN CM support to civil authorities in such a
situation.
                 (b) JTF-CS is a standing JTF comprised of Active, Reserve, and National
Guard members of the USA, USN, USAF, USMC, and United States Coast Guard (USCG),
as well as civilian personnel, and is commanded by a federalized ARNG general officer.
Established in October 1999, JTF-CS is a subordinate unit of USNORTHCOM, a unified
COCOM formed in October 2002 to plan, organize, and execute homeland defense and CS
missions. When directed by the President or the Secretary of Defense, USNORTHCOM
provides military assistance to civil authorities, including CM operations.
                 (c) JTF-CS accomplishes its CBRN CM mission in strict adherence with
the principles of the Constitution and public law. Deployment of JTF-CS, at the direction of
the Commander, USNORTHCOM, and on the authority of the Secretary of Defense, occurs
only after a governor requests federal assistance from the President, and after the
President issues a Presidential Disaster Declaration. In any domestic setting, JTF-CS
remains in support of the IC throughout the CBRN CM operation.
                 (d) CBRNE Consequence Management Response Force (CCMRF). The
CCMRF is a brigade-size combined arms task force tailored as a reinforcing effort for DSCA
in response to CBRNE incidents, and operates under Title 10 USC authority, and in
support of USNORTHCOM under JTF-CS. A CCMRF task force constitutes the majority of
the JTF-CS task force response requirements, and provides force-tailored capabilities, such
as casualty decontamination, security operations, medical triage and treatment, aviation,
logistics, and transportation.
           (2) Defense Threat Reduction Agency. The DTRA consequence management
advisory team (CMAT) deploys to provide joint technical support to the supported
commander with expertise in CBRNE response procedures, requirements, resources, C2,
health physics, public affairs, legal affairs, and specialized technical information. The
CMAT coordinates technical information flow by controlling and resourcing requirements
passed to the supported TOC. The CMAT is able to task-organize and deploy to support
commanders in the technical aspects of CBRNE accidents or incidents. The incident-
tailored force has secure communications, trained technical experts, hazard prediction
modeling capability, and rapid reachback capability.
          (3) Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI). The AFRRI can
provide DOD technical support capability for nuclear/radiological incidents or accidents.
                (a) The AFRRI medical radiobiology advisory team (MRAT) responds as
part of the DTRA CMAT and is available at all times. The MRAT can provide on-site
training to health professionals on the management of nuclear or radiological casualties.
The team provides state-of-the-art expertise and advice to commanders and primary care
providers following a nuclear or radiological accident (nuclear weapons, reactor, or
radiological material). The MRAT provides access to biodosimetry and bioassay support to
incident responders and local health authorities.


A-24              FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37            1 April 2008
               (b) The MRAT is a primary source of medical and radiological health
information dealing with the management of casualties from nuclear warfare weapons and
RDD accidents. Senior medical experts provide on-site advice to physicians on—
               •    Resuscitative techniques for radiation injury and radionuclide
contamination therapy.
                •    The use of investigative chelation therapy for internal contamination
by radioactive material.
                •    Therapeutic drug combinations for acute radiation injury, infection,
and protection against late-occurring diseases (such as cancer).
                   •    Radiation injury interventional therapy and dose estimate bioassay.
           (4) Joint Task Force–Consequence Management. When directed, a response
task force headquarters may be tasked to support the IC during an incident. The
commander may assume OPCON of committed DOD elements (less United States Special
Operations Command and United States Army Corps of Engineers), coordinate military
support of CM operations, and redeploy units when DOD disengagement criteria are met.
The commander establishes a fully functional CP near the incident within 24 hours of
notification. He exercises OPCON of DOD resources committed to providing DSCA,
provides LNOs to appropriate civil agencies, and receives LNOs from appropriate military
commands and agencies. The response team establishes initial liaison with supported civil
agencies and coordinates support for follow-on personnel. See JP 3-41 for more information.
6.    Other Federal Agency Consequence Management Assets
     The following paragraphs identify representative federal assets that could be tasked
to support a CBRN CM incident:
      a.       Department of Homeland Security.
            (1) The Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS). The MMRS operates
as an organized team of specialists. The team’s capabilities include agent detection and
identification, patient decontamination, triage and medical treatment, patient
transportation to hospitals, and coordination with local law enforcement activities. Twenty-
seven teams have been established. As of February 2007, there are 125 MMRS cities, 113 of
which have attained baseline capabilities.
           (2) The USCG National Strike Force (NSF) provides rapidly deployable
technical expertise, specialized equipment, and incident management for lead agency ICs
and federal on-scene commanders for oil, HAZMAT, and WMD incidents.
      b.       Health and Human Services.
           (1) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC capabilities are
epidemiological surveillance, biological agent identification, and public health consultation
and response. The CDC maintains the SNS which can deploy a “push pack” of critical
chemical and biological countermeasures to any point in the United States within 12 hours.
In addition, the SNS can provide civilian medical resupply through its vendor-managed
inventory.
         (2) Office of Preparedness and Response National Medical Response Teams
(NMRTs). NMRTs are manned by medical personnel. These teams are capable of agent



1 April 2008        FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                 A-25
identification, patient decontamination, triage, and medical treatment in support of local
health systems. There are three NMRTs:
       c.   Federal Bureau of Investigation.
           (1) The National Domestic Preparedness Office (NDPO). As an office under the
FBI, Department of Justice, the NDPO coordinates all federal efforts to assist state and
local responders with planning, training, equipment, and exercises necessary to respond to
a CBRN incident. The NDPO—
                 (a) Supports functional program areas for domestic preparedness. An
improved intelligence and information-sharing apparatus underpins the services provided
to the federal, state, and local responder community to distribute lessons learned, asset and
capabilities information, and general readiness knowledge.
                (b) Coordinates the establishment of training curricula and standards for
responder training to ensure consistency, based upon training objectives, and to tailor
training opportunities to meet the needs of the responder community.
              (c) Facilitates and coordinates the efforts of the United States
Government to provide the responder community with detection, protection, analysis, and
decontamination equipment necessary to prepare for and respond to an incident involving
WMD.
                (d) Seeks to provide state and local governments with the resources and
expertise necessary to design, conduct, and evaluate exercise scenarios involving WMD.
               (e) Is responsible for coordinating federal, state, and local WMD
preparedness planning and policy.
           (2) Hazardous Materials Response Unit (HMRU). The HMRU is capable of
specialized sampling, detection, and identification of CBRN agents. It is also equipped with
a variety of rescue equipment and PPE (OSHA levels A through C).
           (3) Evidence Response Teams. The main functions of the evidence response
teams are crime scene documentation and evidence collection in support of criminal
investigations. Some evidence response teams are HAZMAT-trained.
         (4) Critical-Incident Response Group (CIRG). CIRG teams are specially
assembled to conduct tactical and crisis management efforts.
          (5) Intelligence Collection and Analysis. The FBI has experts that contribute to
and coordinate detailed interagency threat assessment activities.
       d.   Environmental Protection Agency.

           (1) EPA On-Scene Commanders (OSCs). Under the authority of the National
Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan, EPA OSCs coordinate all
federal containment, removal, and disposal efforts and resources during an incident.
            (2) Emergency Response Team (ERT). The EPA ERT provides 24-hour access
to special decontamination equipment for chemical releases and advice to the OSC in areas
such as hazard evaluation, risk assessment, multimedia sampling and analysis, on-site
safety, and clean-up techniques. The ERT has portable chemical-agent instrumentation
that is capable of detection and identification in the low and subparts per million
categories, as well as entry-level capabilities using PPE levels A through C.


A-26             FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37             1 April 2008
           (3) Radiological Emergency Response Team (RERT). The EPA RERT provides
on-site monitoring and mobile laboratories for field analysis of samples, along with
expertise in radiation health physics and risk assessment. The RERT is accessible 24 hours
a day.
7.    Technical Reachback
     Technical reachback provides commanders with added expertise and knowledge when
needed during the conduct of CBRN CM.
      a.   Technical reachback is the capability to contact technical subject matter experts
when an information requirement (IR) exceeds the knowledge base of the responding ICS
organization. A common SA among all elements at the incident site, military and civilian, is
imperative. Critical command decisions rely on multiple information sources that include
technical reachback input. Table A-1, page A-28, provides a representative list of agencies
that can provide technical reachback.
      b.  Reachback should be conducted using established protocols. Technical reachback
can support the following representative requirements:
           (1) Nonstandard Agent Identification of CBRN Warfare Agents and TIM.
Military responders are trained to detect and identify selected military warfare agents. If a
TIM is used, or is suspected, then ICS personnel should obtain additional technical
information. This technical information may include persistency, medical effects,
decontamination methods, and/or protection requirements.

           (2) Modeling. During CBRN CM operations, the spread of contamination must
be limited. Technical reachback can help support detailed analysis of an area to assist in
determining downwind hazards; locating staging areas, OCs, and decontamination sites;
making SIP decisions; and conducting an evacuation.
          (3) CBRN Agent Sample Analysis and Evacuation. Sample analysis and
evacuation can use technical reachback to obtain critical information for patient treatment.
Samples evacuated can also be used as forensic evidence.
           (4) Hazard Prediction. Technical experts can use modeling to provide a better
indication of where vapor, liquid, or aerosolized hazards may occur.

    c.     Preincident planning can identify technical reachback sources that may be used
to provide verifiable, validated, and reliable information. The planning and execution
process helps determine the operational value of those capabilities. Other planning
considerations include the following:
           •	  Is technical reachback available at the incident site or at a remote site?
           •	  Do communication requirements include secure or nonsecure capabilities
               and/or audio or video capabilities?
           •	  Does fiscal resourcing support 24 hours a day and 7 days a week technical
               reachback?

     PREPARATION TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, AND PROCEDURES


1.    Vulnerability Reduction Measures
     a.   A key element of ensuring preparedness is to recognize and eliminate
vulnerabilities. Vulnerability reduction measures help units correct weaknesses identified
during the VA. Below is a list of training-, logistics-, personnel-, and readiness-focused
vulnerability reduction measures that can be used to assist a unit in preparing to conduct
or support CBRN CM operations. Other CBRN-related vulnerability reduction measures
can be found in Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological
and Chemical Vulnerability Assessment.
    •     Develop common SOPs and TTP with expected supported and supporting
elements.
     •         Task-organize to fill any gaps in duties and responsibilities.
     •    Train personnel and leaders on nonmilitary terminology and procedures used
during a CBRN CM operation (such as NIMS or ICS).
   •   Obtain (through training) the proper credentials for key personnel (such as
HAZMAT technician or IC training).
     •         Exercise and refine plans with military and civilian counterparts.
     •     Obtain the proper equipment to protect against, detect, and decontaminate
identified hazards.
    •    Develop, request, and maintain push packages for follow-on resupply and
maintenance of all classes of supplies in support of extended operations.
     •     Prepare and maintain medical records for all personnel to ensure that proper
physicals, immunizations, and qualifications for specific hazardous duties (such as site
entry personnel) are up to date.
     •     Ensure that all communications equipment, communications security, and
controlled cryptographic items are serviceable and ready to deploy. This includes
determining the compatibility of communications equipment with other expected
responders.
     b.    During preparation, unit checklists are revised and updated. Checklists are
valuable tools to assist units in responding to incidents. The following checklists provide
examples of activities that should be conducted when responding to a CBRN CM support
operation. The examples are not all-inclusive for every unit and should be viewed as
guidelines to build from for Service-specific requirements. Figure B-1, page B-2, contains a
representative checklist for a CBRN CM (HAZMAT) unit; Figure B-2, page B-4, contains a
representative checklist for a CBRN CM (technical decontamination) unit.

2.    Organization
     a.    A CBRN CM response unit organization provides the commander with the
capabilities to execute assigned missions. Mission analysis identifies key mission-essential
tasks. See paragraph 5 of this appendix for key tasks that CBRN CM response units may
have the capability to perform.
      b.   Changes may require a CBRN unit to reevaluate how it will conduct and support
its mission. Unit personnel must have the training and equipment to execute required
missions. Units may require new equipment and training to provide new capabilities.
Emerging technology is producing new equipment that is being procured to provide
response units with enhanced capabilities. Organizational structures are revised to adapt
to these new capabilities. New equipment issue is accompanied by training and the
supporting TTP.
3.    Equipment
   a.    CBRN CM response unit equipment will likely include military standard and
COTS equipment. Unit leaders ensure that—
      •        Equipment sets are configured to deploy as part of effective unit load plans.
      •        Unit load plans are configured for road, rail, or aerial deployment.
    •    Equipment is maintained according to government and/or commercial technical
manuals.
      •    Trained unit personnel accomplish operator and organizational maintenance
according to PMCS checklists.
       •   Prepared logistic support packages provide units with the needed organizational
level repair parts and supplies.
       •    Prepared support agreements ensure that logistic support (above organizational
level) will provide the needed sustainment during deployment.
     •    Integrated exercises provide mission-related training that includes the use of all
authorized equipment.
      •        Safety-related equipment issues are understood by unit leaders and personnel.
      •        Required inventories are maintained and updated.
        •   Required storage guidelines are followed, especially for perishable, limited-shelf­
life items.
     b.     Equipping a unit to conduct or support a CBRN CM operation requires an
understanding of the operational environment in which the unit will function. Specialized
protective and detection equipment is used when conducting CBRN CM operations. In
many cases, the standard sets of equipment used when conducting CBRN CM operations
must be approved by the NIOSH for use in a hazardous environment. Response units must
not obtain new COTS equipment unless higher command authorities have authorized its
procurement. Even with COTS equipment, standardization of issue is still a key guideline
that will influence equipment fielding.

     b.    CBRN CM response unit personnel are required to meet the capability guidelines
and performance objectives outlined in Tables B-1, page B-6, and B-2, page B-7. Unit
leaders identify those sections within their organizations that require awareness-,
operations-, or technical/specialist-level capabilities.
     c.    Assigned missions (and associated tasks) may require that unit personnel
operate within the hot zone. Therefore, the unit leader must ensure that those personnel
receive the required technician or specialist training.
     d.    Unit leaders prepare plans that outline the training program for their unit.
Plans will likely include provisions for internal training (such as unit sustainment) and
external training (such as attendance at training courses provided by other agencies).
     e.        The unit maintains individual training records to help ensure that training is
current.
5.    Universal Tasks
     a.   JP 3-41, Appendix B, provides a cross-walk between the DOD UJTL and the
DHS universal task list. A summary of the DHS all-hazards task list is provided below. As
DOD unit responders train to standard on Service-specific tactical CBRN CM tasks, they
should understand how they apply to the CM-related DHS tasks.
       b.  The DHS all-hazards universal task list is used for national preparedness. The
list is comprised of four main tasks: prevent, protect, respond, and recover. Conducting
CBRN CM operations falls primarily within the domains of the last two tasks (respond and
recover). DOD participation in CBRN CM operations focuses almost exclusively within the
domain of the respond task. The respond and recover tasks are shown below along with its
supporting subtasks.

                    Figure B-5. Sample National Special Security Event Scenario
     c.   The Homeland Security Council—in partnership with the DHS and federal,
interagency, state, and local homeland security agencies—has developed 15 all-hazards
planning scenarios for use in national, federal, state, and local homeland security
preparedness activities. Following are three scenario extracts that reflect a CBRN incident:
           (1) Scenario 1 (see Figure B-6, page B-14). Nuclear Detonation, 10-Kiloton
IND. In this scenario, terrorist members of the UA group assemble a gun-type nuclear
device using highly enriched uranium (HEU) stolen from a nuclear facility located in the
former Soviet Union. (In this context, HEU is weapons-grade uranium.) The nuclear device
components are smuggled into the United States. The 10-kiloton nuclear device is


1 April 2008         FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                                        B-13
assembled near a major metropolitan center. Using a delivery van, terrorists transport the
device to the central business district of a large city and detonate it. Most buildings within
1,000 meters (approximately 3,200 feet) of the detonation are severely damaged. Injuries
from flying debris (missiles) may occur out to 6 kilometers (approximately 3.7 miles). An
electromagnetic pulse damages many electronic devices within about 5 kilometers
(approximately 3 miles). A mushroom cloud rises above the city and begins to drift east-
northeast.
       Casualties                               Can vary widely.
       Infrastructure Damage                    Total within radius of 0.5 to 1.0 mile.
       Evacuations/Displaced Persons            450,000 or more.
       Contamination                            Approximately 3,000 square miles.
       Economic Impact                          Hundreds of billions of dollars.
       Potential for Multiple Events            No.
       Recovery Timeline                        Years.

            (2) Scenario 2 (see Figure B-7). Biological Attack: Aerosol Anthrax. Anthrax
spores dispersed by aerosol delivery results in the inhalation of anthrax, which develops
when the bacterial organism, Bacillus anthracis, is inhaled into the lungs. A progressive
infection follows. This scenario describes a single aerosol anthrax attack delivered by a
truck using a concealed improvised spraying device in one densely-populated urban city
with a significant commuter workforce. It does not, however, exclude the possibility of
multiple attacks in disparate cities or time-phased attacks (i.e., “reload”). For federal
planning purposes, it will be assumed that the UA will attack five separate metropolitan
areas in a sequential manner. Three cities will be attacked initially, followed by two
additional cities 2 weeks later.
       Casualties                               13,000 fatalities and injuries.
       Infrastructure Damage                    Minimal, other than contamination.
       Evacuations/Displaced Persons            Possibly.
       Contamination                            Extensive.
       Economic Impact                          Billions of dollars.
       Potential for Multiple Events            Yes.
       Recovery Timeline                        Months.

            (3) Scenario 3 (see Figure B-8). Chemical Attack: Nerve Agent. Sarin, also
known as GB, is a human-made CWA classified as a nerve agent. Nerve agents are the
most toxic and rapidly acting of the known CWAs. Sarin is a clear, colorless, and tasteless
liquid that has no odor in its pure form; however, sarin can evaporate into a vapor and
spread into the environment. In this scenario, the UA builds six spray-dissemination
devices and releases sarin vapor into the ventilation systems of three large commercial
office buildings in a metropolitan area. The agent kills 95 percent of the people in the
buildings and kills or sickens many of the responders. In addition, some of the agent exits
through rooftop ventilation stacks, creating a downwind hazard. For purposes of estimating
federal response requirements, each building is assumed to have an occupancy of 2,000
personnel (twenty-story buildings with 100 occupants per floor), and the outdoor/subway

7.    Rehearsals
     As with any military operation, conducting rehearsals can mean the difference
between success and failure. Rehearsals allow individuals and units to establish their roles,
responsibilities, and duties in any given mission and to visualize how they fit into the
larger scheme of operations. It also reveals flaws and weaknesses in a plan so that
corrections can be made prior to execution.

                                          Appendix C
          RESPONSE TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, AND PROCEDURES

1.   Command and Control
     A clearly defined and understood C2 during CBRN CM allows for effective synergistic
operations.
     a.        C2 and Synchronization.
           (1) Effective C2 is essential to maximize the use of available assets in
accomplishing CBRN CM missions. C2 relationships may be tailored to a particular
situation, whether domestic or foreign. Unity of effort is achieved by focusing on the
commander’s intent and maintaining coordination with the IC. An effective C2 system
supports the synchronization of military and civilian agency operations to ensure an
effective and efficient response to CBRN CM operations.
           (2) As stated in Chapter I, military CM response assets remain under the C2 of
the military chain of command. The CP is the field office for on-scene unit emergency
operations and requires access to communications, information, and technical and
administrative support. The CP should be located so that the incident site is in view; this
allows the commander to supervise and control the accomplishment of the assigned
mission. Capabilities that should be resident at the CP include—
               •   Communications.
               •   Reference material (computer and/or paper copies).
               •   Situational status.
               •   Maps.
               •   General administrative support.
     b.    Notification. Requests for DOD CM support originate from civilian authorities
(DHS or DOS) in the aftermath of a CBRN incident. When requested through appropriate
channels, DOD makes resources available to assist the IC in response to a CBRN incident.
Upon appropriate notification, military response assets deploy to support the IC that is
tasked with managing the coordinated federal response to a CBRN incident. The DCO is
normally delegated OPCON of DOD response assets assigned to the operation. Upon
activation, the DCO provides a response capability, establishes liaison with military
response elements, supports crisis management and CM operations associated with the
CBRN incident, and conducts requisite predeployment and deployment actions.
           (1) The response unit will likely receive a WARNORD as preliminary notice of
an upcoming deployment to an incident site. At this point, the unit may execute the unit
recall procedures, assemble the unit, alert the reachback and integrated logistic support
systems, begin identifying required information, and plan the deployment.
           (2) Following notification, the commander will likely need access to critical
incident information to support required planning steps. To support this need, the
commander may receive permission to deploy an ADVON. Representative ADVON
functions are shown in Table C-1, page C-2.

                                      brief.

           (3) Upon notification and receipt of a valid deployment order, the response unit
deploys to the designated staging area in the AO. Upon arrival, the unit initiates contact
with the local IC and/or the supported emergency response organization. Once the response
unit notifies the gaining command of their arrival, key site mapping information is used
and/or updated to provide a quick orientation. This information may include—
              Hazard control zones (cold, warm, and hot zones and minimum safe distances).
              Site terrain.
              Ingress and egress routes.
              Site accessibility by vehicle and on foot.
              Off-site populations or environments at risk.
          Weather conditions (wind speed and direction, temperature, precipitation,
humidity, and forecast).
              Site maps (detailed and to scale).
     c.    Reporting. The coordination of warning and reporting activities during CBRN
CM is essential for maintaining SA. The response unit reports to the C2 element via
electronic means and liaison.
           (1) Reporting during an incident or CBRN emergency is an important
aspect of the response. The response unit must provide timely and accurate
information to effectively support the response operation and the decision-making
process at all tiers of the response. Examples of reports that a unit may provide are
summarized in Table C-2.
           (2) Reporting timelines and frequency will be according to the timelines
specified in applicable OPLANs/OPORDs and the directives published by the IC or



C-2                   FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                              1 April 2008
staff. During operations, the reporting sequence should be from the unit to the
parent headquarters (at the incident site) and to other activities at the incident site
(as designated in written or oral instructions to the response unit).
                                    Table C-2. Reporting Timelines

               Report                                           Submission Timeline

      Deployment Report                      Not later than _________ after departure and arrival.

      SITREP                                 As required.

      Requests for Support (RFSs)            As required by procedures.

      RFI                                    As required.

      Redeployment Report                    Not later than __________ after departure and return to
                                             home station.
      OPREP3                                 According to higher-level command guidance.

      Post-mission Report                    According to higher-level command guidance.

           (3) Reports must be timely and concise and include enough information for
addressees to fully understand the situation. Operational reports (OPREPs), deployment
reports, SITREPs, RFSs, and reports used during redeployments will be submitted
according to OPLAN, OPORD, and SOP requirements.
               (4)   The exchange of information from periodic reporting and SITREPs
support—
               •     Prioritization of CM efforts and associated resource allocations.
               •     Resolution of issues.
               •     Identification of resource shortages.
               •     Implementation of IC decisions.
               •     SA.
           (5) Depending on the classification guidelines established, secure
communications may also be a requirement. Many of the reports that update the situation
will be provided on a near-real-time basis to the various users (such as military support C2
elements, IC, and area CPs). Effective and efficient reports are needed, and timeliness is
critical. Most reports are provided on a periodic basis; however, some SITREPs may involve
high-priority issues and its submission may involve high-priority requirements (such as on-
scene emergency management).
           (6) Information requirements that may be reported via SITREPs or OPREPs
include the following:
               •     Identification of CBRN hazards.
               •     Disposition of CBRN casualties.
               •     Arrival or departure of CBRN CM units.

           •     Injuries or incidents involving personnel operating within the hot zone.
           •     Significant loss or contamination of equipment.
           •     Additional CBRN hazards identified at the incident site.
      d.   Liaison. The military response unit conducts liaison and coordination and
receives reports to remain updated on key operational, personnel, and logistical
information. Subsequent information in this appendix (such as coordination and incident
site assessment characterization) provides other key resources for data that can be obtained
through the liaison process. The response unit uses this information to support several
tasks. These tasks include the following:
           (1)   Preparing reports, assessments, vulnerability analyses, and hazard
predictions.
           (2) Monitoring the augmentation of civilian and military response elements at
the incident site.
            (3) Maintaining unit incident information boards that include event situation,
event casualty, damage summary, weather and evacuation status, area closing and shelter
facility status, resources status, hospital bed availability, contracts and agreements, and
incident logs.
          (4) Collecting, processing, and disseminating information about the incident to
other elements.
          (5) Recommending unit employment strategies for its optimum use as a
response element.
           (6) Conducting predictive analysis to identify vulnerabilities at the incident
site and advising the IC of results.
            (7) Receiving the necessary information on sample analysis and/or
identification of unknown substances.
          (8) Using reachback communication links to designated scientists and subject
matter experts for advisory, confirmatory, and technical information.
           (9)   Monitoring performance of surveys to complete assessments, as required.
           (10) Advising on protocols regarding military chemical agents, military chemical
agent precursors, known biological agents, unknown biological agents, dispersed
radiological material, and TIM.
          (11) Advising the IC on the additional unit capabilities that could help in
mitigation of CBRN effects at the incident site.
           (12) Helping the IC develop RFAs for additional response capabilities, providing
information to assets identified to respond, and bridging any civil-military communication
gaps or issues.
     e.  Coordination. Coordination is accomplished to support internal and external
requirements.
            (1) Coordinating requirements within the internal structure of the response
unit is facilitated through the use of SOPs, checklists, and a common understanding of the
ICS framework.


C-4              FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37              1 April 2008
           (2) Coordinating external requirements is also facilitated through SOPs,
checklists, and a common understanding of the ICS framework. Although every CBRN CM
incident will be different, the ICS framework provides a central focal point for coordination
measures. For the military response unit, coordination points will be identified in the
higher headquarters OPORD. If direct coordination is authorized with the ICS structure,
see Figure C-1 for the ICS structure and Table C-3, page C-6, for the key external
coordination points, especially those pertaining to functions within the HAZMAT Branch,
Operations Section.

NOTE: A response unit should not go to each activity within the ICS structure to
receive information, but should use key coordination focal points. Those key
focal points would likely be the ICS Liaison Officer, the Operations Section
HAZMAT Liaison Officer, and/or the Planning Section.

2.         Incident Site Assessment
     Incident site assessment provides the IC with SA of the conditions and hazards that
exist at an incident site. The SA is derived from the information received from site
characterization. Information is collected during the characterization process to support
decision requirements. The R&S data, including samples, provide input for the
characterization and assessment effort and support the agent identification process. As
CBRN hazards are identified, advise and assist actions become more focused on specific
measures to help mitigate the CBRN hazard.
      a.      Characterization.
            (1)  Characterization of the incident site starts when the incident is first
recognized. Any information gathered, including historical information, will assist in
characterizing the incident. Characterization of the site is a continual process as the
situation changes while the operation is progressing. Characterization falls into two
categories—general characterization and technical characterization. For each category, the
goal is to determine who is involved or affected by the incident, what has happened, when it
occurred, where exactly the affected area is located, and why the incident occurred, if
known. Characterizing the incident site also includes the following evaluations:


C-6                   FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                                 1 April 2008
                   (a) Physical and CBRN hazards associated with the site.
                   (b) PPE requirements for personnel entering the warm and hot zones.
                   (c)   Decontamination requirements.
                   (d) Contamination containment requirements.
                   (e)   Access points and site security.
            (2)  See Table C-4 for a sample site characterization checklist that should
enable the response unit to help gain the needed SA. The response unit should not require
all of the information offered in Table C-4. The commander will determine what IRs are
important for the mission.

     b.    Reconnaissance and Surveillance. Conducting R&S operations assist in
characterization of the site. An incident site survey can identify the location of
contamination and the physical hazards that may hinder mitigation of the hazards; it
provides information to the IC and future entry teams for prioritization of mitigation
efforts. R&S also provides information for possible sampling operations. Reconnaissance is
among the most critical tasks for management of a CBRN incident. Reconnaissance will use
data input from sources such as observable indicators and monitoring and detection
equipment. Surveillance (biological and medical) also serves to provide data to support site




C-8                   FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37            1 April 2008
characterization requirements. The collection of R&S data is accomplished on a continuing
basis. The R&S collection effort is coordinated to preclude wasted effort.
           (1)   Reconnaissance. Reconnaissance measures include observation of visible
indicators and the use of monitoring instruments. Detailed information on reconnaissance
TTP can be found in Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear,
Biological, and Chemical Reconnaissance.
                (a) Initial reconnaissance may use the following observable indicators to
support incident data collection:
                 •    Occupancy and Location. The incident site may be located at a CBRN
production, storage, or transportation venue.
                 •   Container/Device Characteristics. The size, shape, and construction
features are an indicator for the potential recognition of the CBRN material involved. The
container (or dissemination device) may be as simply constructed as a liquid plastic
container, a sack (nonbulk packaging), an aerosol container, bulk packaging, or a
pressurized container.
                 •   Marking and Colors. A container may have specific markings or colors
which provide some indication of the hazard or contents. These indicators may include color
codes, container specification numbers, signal words, or the content’s name and associated
hazards.
                 •    Placards and Labels. The placards and labels affixed to items such as
freight containers or cargo tanks, serve as an indicator to support identification of the
CBRN hazard.
                 •   Shipping Papers and Facility Documents. Shipping papers also serve
to provide key information about the nature of the material being shipped.
                •   Senses. Senses are certainly not a primary tool; however, data on
agent smell, appearance (color), and signs and symptoms can yield observable indicators.
                 (b) Monitoring and detection instruments and sampling are important
tools used to—
                 •   Determine the appropriate levels of PPE.
                 •   Determine the size and location of hazard control zones.
                 •   Develop protective action recommendations and corridors.
                 •   Assess the potential health effects of exposure.
                 •   Determine when the incident scene is safe and allow former occupants
to return.
                  (c) Reconnaissance techniques used within the hot zone will be
coordinated with the IC’s Operations Section to ensure that an integrated, synchronized,
tactical-level strategy is used.
                (d) Specific CBR reconnaissance TTP are outlined in Multiservice Tactics,
Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Reconnaissance.
Depending on the government and COTS monitoring and detection equipment in use, the
guidance found in the MTTP may require adaptation to specific operational situations.


1 April 2008     FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                      C-9
                (e) The response unit (equipped with monitoring equipment) uses a
monitoring strategy that considers the following operational challenges:
                 •    Selecting the appropriate monitoring instruments based on the use of
a known CBRN/TIM or unknown materials. Identified monitoring equipment should be
able to detect the anticipated hazard, measure applicable concentrations, and operate
under field conditions at the site.
                •    Determining whether a hazard is present. The absence of a positive
response does not imply that contaminants are not present. Contaminant concentrations
affected by wind, temperature, moisture, or interferents could impact monitoring results.
Conversely, monitoring teams should never assume that only one hazard is present.
                  •    Establishing action levels based on monitoring results.
                 (f) Reconnaissance actions may also provide samples to support the
identification process. Military sampling procedures are contained in Multiservice Tactics,
Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Reconnaissance.
However, military response units should expect to use the sampling techniques that are in
place at the incident site. The value of a sample can be lost if consistent sample-collection
protocols are not used.
           (2)    Surveillance. Biological and medical surveillance play key roles in support
of incident site assessment. Threat assessments will influence the use of samplers and/or
detection equipment for biological surveillance. The TTP for biological surveillance are
provided in Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Biological Surveillance.
Medical surveillance is conducted on a continuing basis. Medical surveillance results are
used to monitor the health status of the CM response force. See FM 4-02.7 for information
on how DOD PVNTMED capabilities provide health risk assessment planning, operations,
and advice within the ICS.
       c.   Identification.
            (1)   Supporting military response units use organic government and COTS
capabilities to identify suspected CBRN contaminants. Various levels of confidence are
associated with identification results, depending upon the source. For example, biodetectors
such as the handheld assay provide presumptive identification results. Supporting field and
fixed-site laboratories provide definitive and confirmatory identification results that impart
a higher level of confidence. The identification process is also used to provide analysis and
identification of samples collected during the reconnaissance process.
            (2)   Military response units provide capabilities briefings to its supported
activities/units at the incident site, including limitations.
            (3)  Technical reachback capabilities may also be used to support the
identification process.
        (4)   Information contributed by the identification process supports incident
command advise and assist functions and decisions.
           (5)    Prior planning ensures the availability of the requisite technical specialists
and units for different types of CBRN contamination.
           (6)   As required, the response unit may also package CBR samples and
transfer chain of custody to the applicable receiving organization.


C-10              FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37               1 April 2008
           (7)  The identification process directly links to the other military support
functions (characterization, advice, and assistance) and provides the commander with a full
dimensional picture.
     d.     Advice. The response unit may provide an augmentee to the incident command
planning and/or operations section to provide advice on the technical aspects of CBRN CM
response. For example, during a response, the augmentee may recommend measures such
as the follow-on capabilities (types of units, equipment, and supplies) needed to support
mitigation measures at an incident site. Postincident, the military support commander can
advise on measures such as the preparation of a transition plan. This plan helps support
the disengagement of military units for redeployment to home stations. Other advisory
support functions could include interagency operations to provide technical expertise and
consultation to the local authority. The augmentee could also recommend decontamination
actions for tailoring of actions to minimize the impact of the event.
     e.    Assistance. The supporting response unit provides input to the IC on the unit’s
capabilities to support CM incident operations. This assistance may help emergency
response officials identify capabilities gaps and prepare RFAs. The assistance from the
response units contributes to the IC’s COP at the incident site. The response unit can assist
in determining how unit capabilities can be tailored to meet new mission requirements.
Unanticipated tasks will arise. Military response units provide a versatile and resilient
capability to meet new challenges.
     f.     Site Safety. The response unit provides the IC with frequent updates. Tools such
as the site safety plan are updated periodically to ensure the safety of responders and
citizens. Site safety tasks that the military support staff performs include—
          (1) Analyzing the hazards at the incident site and conducting a risk analysis of
those hazards.
               (2)   Maintaining and updating the site map or sketches.
               (3)   Updating the site control zones (hot, warm, and cold).
               (4)   Monitoring decontamination area operations.
               (5)   Ensuring that site communications diagrams remain updated.
               (6)   Updating information on the location of CPs or command centers.
               (7)   Maintaining and updating hazard-monitoring overlays and results.
3.      Incident Site Framework
     From a tactical perspective, the incident site framework can be grouped into like
tasks. These can include (but are not limited to) the following:
        •      Assuming command and establishing control at the incident site.
        •      Ensuring the safe approach and positioning of response assets at the incident
site.
        •      Establishing staging areas to control arriving resources.




1 April 2008         FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                  C-11
       •    Establishing hazard control zones.
     •     Assessing the need for immediate actions (rescue) and implementing protective
actions (evacuate or SIP).
       a.   Command.
        (1) A CBRN CM operation requires central command authority. A central
command will—
          •    Assign command responsibility to one particular individual through a
standard identification system.
            •   Ensure that strong, direct, and visible command is established as soon as
possible.
           •    Establish a management framework that clearly outlines the objectives and
functions of the operations.
          (2) As part of the centralized command structure, responsible units are notified
of the command structure and the location for the CP. An experienced commander gives up
the advantage of a stationary CP only when it is absolutely necessary for the IC to
personally provide one-on-one direction to emergency response personnel operating in
forward positions. In each case, the IC must maintain a command presence.
         (3) The IC establishes a staging area in an easily accessible location and
announces the location for incoming personnel and equipment.
       b.   Approach and Positioning.
           (1) Safe approach and positioning by the responders is critical to managing the
overall incident. For example, if responders become contaminated, the action plan shifts
from protecting the public to rescuing and decontaminating the responders.
           (2) When possible, responders approach from uphill and upwind. Responders
look for physical indicators of contaminant and avoid wet areas, vapor clouds, and spilled
material. Conditions can change quickly at an incident site, and the IC does not allow
positioning too close until a proper assessment has been completed.
       c.   Staging Areas.
           (1) The staging area is the designated location where emergency response
resources (equipment and personnel) are assigned until they are needed.
            (2) Staging is a function of the operations section. The staging officer accounts
for all incoming emergency response units, dispatches resources to the emergency scene at
the request of the IC, and requests additional emergency resources, as necessary.
           (3) The ideal staging area is close enough to the perimeter to significantly
reduce response time, yet far enough away to provide the unit the mobility required to
rapidly respond to an assignment. Staging is effective when the IC anticipates that
additional resources may be required and orders them to respond to a predesignated area
approximately 3 minutes from the scene.
           (4) Staging areas should be clearly identified through the use of signs, color-
coded flags or lights, or other suitable means. The exact location of the staging area will be
based upon prevailing wind conditions and the nature of the emergency.



C-12             FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37               1 April 2008
           (5) Large CBRN incidents can bring extensive resources to the scene, which
may be needed at different times throughout the emergency. If resources will not be
required for some time, the IC should consider establishing primary and secondary staging
areas.
     d.        Isolation and Perimeter.
           (1) Isolating the hazard area and establishing a perimeter are two of the first
tactical considerations of a CBRN CM operation.
           (2) The first objective of the isolation procedure, after rescue, is to immediately
limit the number of civilian and response personnel exposed to the CBRN materials. This
begins by identifying and establishing an isolation perimeter. When confronted with an
incident inside a structure, the best place to begin is at the points of entry such as the main
entrance doors. Once doorways are secured and the entry of unauthorized personnel is
denied, response teams can begin to isolate above and below the hazard. Proper protective
clothing and equipment must be worn.
            (3) The same concept applies for outdoor situations. First, secure the entry
points, and then establish an isolation perimeter around the CBRN hazard. Begin by
controlling intersections, on/off ramps, service roads, or any other access to the scene. At
this point, a CBRN reconnaissance team can begin an assessment.
           (4) The IC should make perimeter isolation assignments as soon as possible.
Security personnel involved in establishing a perimeter must know what the potential
hazards and risks appear to be. If there is any possibility that these officers may be exposed
to the hazard as the isolation area expands, they must be provided with proper safety
equipment and specific directions concerning evacuation, if required.
     e.        Protective Actions.
           (1) Initiating protective actions, such as SIP or evacuation, is a tactical
strategy used by the IC to protect the general population from CBRN material. This tactical
strategy is usually implemented after the IC has established an isolation perimeter and
defined the hazard control zones for emergency responders.
           (2) This decision-making process uses a combination of factors to determine
protective actions, including the size and nature of the release, hazards of the materials
involved, weather conditions, type of facility, and the availability of airtight structures.
            (3) See Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear,
Biological, and Chemical Protection and Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
for Installation Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense for further
guidance on evacuation and SIP.
     f.        Hazard Control Zones.
           (1) When the primary isolation perimeter has been secured, the IC can
establish hazard control zones. The IC divides the area into three distinctly different zones,
beginning at the incident scene and working outward toward the perimeter. Hazard control
zones are designated from most to least dangerous as hot, warm, and cold zones.
          (2) The primary purpose of establishing three different hazard control zones
within the isolation perimeter is to provide the highest level of control and personnel
accountability for response personnel working at the incident scene. Defined zones help


1 April 2008         FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                  C-13
ensure that responders do not inadvertently cross into a contaminated area or place
themselves in locations that could be quickly threatened by explosions or migrating vapor
clouds.
           (3) As a general rule, the field CP and support personnel should be located in
the cold zone, emergency operations personnel supporting the CBRN HAZMAT team should
be positioned in the cold and warm zones, and the entry team should be located in the hot
zone, as necessary.
           (4) Hazard control zones should be physically marked and posted on the IC’s
C2 chart. The hot zone can be indicated with colored banner tape, color-coded traffic cones,
or color-coded light sticks. In outdoor situations, hazard control zones can be designated by
using key geographical reference points such as a tank dike wall, fence line, or street name.
Geographic areas should be communicated verbally by radio or in a face-to-face briefing
between the IC and sector officers. When the hazard is confined to a building, these zones
can be denoted by its location within the structure.
                  (a) The hot zone is the area in which hazards present could cause adverse
effects on personnel who do not have appropriate levels of personal protection. These
personnel should be immediately evacuated or SIP actions initiated, depending on the
situation. The initial isolation zone, identified in the Emergency Response Guide, is the
initial distance the incident is isolated in order to contain the hazard and protect personnel.
The initial isolation zone size is dependent upon the hazard, weather conditions, and area
affected. The protective action zone, also identified in the Emergency Response Guide, is the
area in which a downwind hazard may be present depending on the weather conditions and
terrain at the incident site. Both the initial isolation zone and the protective action zone are
encompassed in the hot zone, which provides an additional buffer from the associated
hazards prior to entering the warm zone.
                 (b) The warm zone is the area surrounding the hot zone that is also
referred to as the decontamination zone. Contamination reduction and decontamination
operations are conducted in this zone to limit the spread of contamination to the cold zone.
See Appendix D for information relating to the decontamination zone.
                (c) The cold zone, also referred to as the support zone, is an area
surrounding the warm and hot zones where incident support operations are coordinated.
Personnel in this zone are not required to wear PPE, but should have it on hand in case of a
sudden change in weather conditions.
                 (d) The decontamination corridor is established in the warm zone to
provide decontamination support and control the spread of contamination. Multiple
decontamination corridors may be established at an incident site depending upon the
situation. The decontamination corridor is established in an uncontaminated area just
outside the contaminated hot zone boundary. Once contaminated personnel have been
processed through the decontamination corridor, access to the corridor must be controlled to
preclude entry by unprotected personnel. See Chapter V and Appendix D for further
information.

     a.    Laboratory Services. Medical laboratory services are provided by operational
units such as the USA AML; USN laboratories and FDPMUs; USAF TETs; or local, state,
federal, and HN laboratories. Medical laboratory services within MTFs are able to perform



1 April 2008        FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                                      C-15
limited identification of a suspect agent from patient specimens generated within the
facility; however, they are not staffed or equipped to perform analysis on specimens
collected outside of the facility.
           (1) The level of characterization is determined by the capabilities of the
supporting laboratory. Operational DOD medical laboratory elements are capable of
providing field confirmatory identification of a suspect agent. USAMRIID, the NMRC, and
the CDC will provide definitive identification of a suspect biological agent. Supporting
medical laboratories must coordinate with local, state, and federal laboratories to ensure
that sample data is provided to the appropriate authorities.
            (2) State and HN laboratories may have the capability to provide confirmatory
identification of suspect biological agents. However, coordination must be made with these
laboratories to determine its capabilities.
           (3) The CDC established a Laboratory Response Network (LRN) that can
respond to bioterrorism, chemical terrorism, and other public health emergencies. The LRN
is a national network of local, state, and federal public health; food testing; veterinary
diagnostic; environmental; DOD; and international laboratories that provide the laboratory
infrastructure and capacity to respond to biological and chemical terrorism and other public
health emergencies. The laboratories that make up the LRN are affiliated with federal
agencies, CONUS DOD laboratories, international partners, and state/local public health
departments. See Table C-6 for LRN levels and capabilities.

        National laboratories, including those operated by the CDC, USAMRIID, and the
NMRC, are responsible for specialized strain characterizations, bioforensics, select agent
activity, and handling of highly infectious biological agents. They provide definitive
characterization of agents.
      Reference laboratories are responsible for investigation and/or referral of specimens.
They are made up of public health, military, international, veterinary, agricultural, food,
and water testing laboratories. They provide confirmatory identification of agents.

        Sentinel laboratories play a key role in the early detection of biological agents.
Sentinel laboratories provide routine diagnostic services, rule-out, and referral steps in the
identification process. While these laboratories may not be equipped to perform the same
tests as LRN reference laboratories, they can test samples. They provide presumptive
identification of agents.
       b.     Veterinary Services. As the DOD executive agent for veterinary services, the
United States Army Veterinary Corps provides support to all branches of DOD. Depending
upon the location of the incident, veterinary services may be provided by deployable and
nondeployable veterinary units or personnel. Veterinary services include, but are not
limited to—
        (1) Monitoring the security and protection of subsistence in the CBRN environment.
       (2) Inspecting subsistence and providing disposition instructions in the CBRN
environment.
      (3) Monitoring the decontamination of CBRN-contaminated subsistence, military
working dogs (MWDs), and other government-owned animals.
       (4) Treating MWDs and other government-owned animals that become CBRN
casualties.
      (5) Providing consultation and guidance on animal care and food safety to non-DOD
responders and local populace on the effects of a CBRN incident.
        (6) Providing assistance to privately owned animals in cases of evacuation.
        (7) Providing food and water laboratory testing capabilities.
       (8) Reporting intelligence data through command channels. See FM 4-02.7, FM 4­
02.18, Veterinary Services Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures, and FM 8-42, Combat
Health Support in Stability Operations and Support Operations, for additional information.
        c.     Health Service Logistics. The HSL system provides medical supplies and
equipment for response to a CBRN incident in the AO or as part of the homeland security
response to a domestic or foreign terrorist incident. In joint operations, the CCDR may
designate one service as the single integrated medical logistics management (SIMLM)
agency for all services operating within the CBRN CM AO. SIMLM functions encompass
the provision of medical supplies, medical equipment maintenance and repair, blood
management, arrangement for contract support, provision of patient movement items, and
optical fabrication to all Joint forces within the AO including, on an emergency basis, USN
ships for common-use items. By exercising directive authority over the HSL arena for the
accomplishment of assigned missions; the CCDR can centralize control, reduce duplication
of services, and provide the support in a more economical and efficient manner. For
additional information on HSL, refer to Service-specific technical reference manuals. See
appendix D for HSS recovery TTP.
       d. Combat and Operational Stress/Behavioral Health. CBRN presents multiple
challenges to military operations when considering COS. The perception of a CBRN threat,
whether real or not, in a high-COS environment places military members at high risk of
suffering combat and operational stress reactions (COSR). Therefore, commanders and
leaders must take actions to prevent and reduce the potential numbers of COSR casualties.
Working in an actual CBRN environment poses both a real and perceived danger to
military members conducting military operations. Pseudosymptoms may be experienced by


1 April 2008     FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                     C-17
those believing they have been exposed or simply overwhelmed by the operational stressors
resulting from CBRN use. Whether the threat is real or perceived, when working in an
actual CBRN environment, the protective measures alone can be a significant stressor to
military members required to use these protective measures. COS care in a CBRN
environment is the commander’s responsibility. The COS care service delivery is achieved
through the aid of many resources available to the command to include military behavioral
health assets. The key to successful COS care operations in a CBRN environment is the
prevention activities that are conducted prior to actual CBRN events. These may include—
          (1) Training in MOPP Level 4 to increase personnel confidence in their ability
to wear the ensemble.
          (2) Training in the protective mask often. It takes repeated wear and time to
acclimate and get over the claustrophobic feeling of wearing the mask.
          (3) Emphasizing the buddy system as a means of keeping watch for each other.
Peer support is a key element in reducing COSR at the unit level.
     e.    PVNTMED Services. PVNTMED units/personnel provide support and
consultation in the areas of DNBI prevention, field sanitation, entomology, sanitary
engineering, and epidemiology to minimize the effects of environmental injuries, enteric
diseases, vector-borne diseases, and other health threats to personnel. PVNTMED services
include, but are not limited to—
           (1) Coordinating CBRN-related specimen collections and environmental
sampling, monitoring, and evaluation activities with treatment, CBRN, laboratory, and
intelligence personnel in the operational environment.
         (2) Monitoring casualties, hospital admissions, and reports of autopsy for signs
of CW and BW agent use.
          (3) Collecting environmental samples and specimens and performing selected
analyses or evaluations to assist in the assessment of the health threat.
         (4) Monitoring field sanitation, water treatment and storage, waste disposal,
and DNBI control practices and providing advice and training as necessary.
           (5) Investigating and evaluating sanitation, water supply, waste disposal
practices, and other environmental health-related problems and recommending corrective
measures as necessary.
           (6) Conducting health surveillance activities in the AO, to include coordinating,
compiling, analyzing, and reporting surveillance data to assist in evaluating conditions
affecting the health of the supported force.
           (7)     Conducting epidemiological investigations.
5.     Logistics
     Logistics is an integral part of CBRN CM operations and must be considered during
all phases from planning, through response, to recovery.
      a.    Response. Logistics must be planned and integrated early in a CBRN CM
response to be effective. The challenge of logistics is the effective integration of DOD
logistics within the services and with sustaining organizations; support agencies; and other
local, state, federal, and HN agencies, as required. No matter the size of the CBRN CM



C-18               FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37           1 April 2008
operation, some level of logistic support will be required. Table C-7 provides a checklist for
logistic support operations during a CBRN CM response.
                                   Table C-7. Logistic Support Checklist
                                                     Supply
Pre-position material at or near the point of planned use or at a designated location to reduce reaction time
and to ensure timely support of a specific force during the initial phases of an operation.
Coordinate and synchronize supply functions with the supported IC logistics section.
Coordinate support (as required) with commercial vendors or a central government contracting focal point to
resupply common COTS items such as bleach or services such as oxygen bottle refills.
Control the allocation of high demand logistics resources such as CBRN float items (detection and
surveillance).
Establish procedures to monitor and track the issue of supplies to civilian personnel. This process supports
maintaining controls for reimbursement of costs following the mission.
Monitor and approve (if required) the stock levels for CBRN supplies.
Approve the return of CBRN COTS components or systems for repair or replacement.
Check on the receipt, storage, and distribution of CBRN supplies. For example, selected items may require
temperature controls and/or require segregated and/or secure storage.
                                                 Transportation
Ensure that the required military resources reach the incident site on time with the needed supplies and
equipment.
Coordinate the time phasing of military support resources with the supported IC.
Maintain asset visibility on the shipment of repairable material such as detection and surveillance equipment
for repair.
Transport samples taken from the incident site.
                                                  Maintenance
Coordinate emergency and routine actions to maintain personnel and materiel in a safe and serviceable
condition.
Coordinate for the replacement or repair of damaged or contaminated mission-essential equipment.

     b.    Responder Support. The logistics process facilitates obtaining, maintaining,
storing, moving, and replenishing resources used in responding to a CBRN incident. For
example, transportation support is required to move assets, both human and materiel, in
response to a CBRN incident. This includes the ability to protect the transportation means
and the operators providing response support. Elements of the sustainment process used to
support an incident may include contracting, negotiated support, military support, and
support from other federal agencies.
            (1) Contracting. Contracting, purchasing, renting, or leasing supplies or
services from nonfederal sources are effective and efficient ways to provide support in a
crisis. Included are all classes of supply or maintenance used in a CBRN response situation.
During the initial stages of an operation, contracting officers are required to procure
supplies and services.
           (2) Negotiated Support. In some cases, civil authorities have enough logistical
resources to support not only themselves but also the military units providing assistance.
For example, civil authorities may provide housing, food, and fuel to military assets. Such
support is negotiated on a case-by-case basis with the civil authorities.
            (3) Military Support. Installations continue habitual relationships with units,
but they may also have to support personnel with whom they have no established support
relationship. These personnel include civil authorities and elements from other Services. If
an installation or other source discussed below cannot provide the required support
directly, planners tailor a support force.

          (4) Support from Other Federal Agencies. Federal agencies such as GSA
provide support to civil authorities. GSA provides general supplies and services that are
common to more than one department of the federal government. While GSA can provide
an extensive amount of support to DOD, other federal agencies and organizations may
provide assistance depending on the nature, scope, and duration of the operation.
           (5) Other. Special event packages containing items such as decontamination,
detection, and medical equipment may be pre-positioned as part of a preparedness program.
This equipment can be transported by air and ground on a short notice and is available for
use by civilian responders and military support elements.

                                        Appendix D 

       RECOVERY TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, AND PROCEDURES 


1.    Decontamination Operations
     TTP for recovery operations include various supporting decontamination types, to
include, emergency, technical, and MCD. Also, HSS, logistics, and transition TTP occur
during CBRN CM recovery.
      a.    The decontamination process begins in the warm zone. A controlled entry point
marks the entrance to the decontamination corridor, and a controlled exit point marks the
exit to the VCL (the transition point between the warm and cold zones). More than one type
of decontamination corridor can be operated in the warm zone based on situational needs.
The main decontamination corridors used in CBRN CM response operations are emergency,
technical, mass casualty, and patient decontamination. Detailed discussion of each
decontamination corridor will be provided further in the appendix.
       b.  Chronologically, the emergency decontamination corridor is generally set up by
first responders (local HAZMAT teams) to facilitate immediate response and
decontamination of personnel that were in the hot zone when the incident occurred.
Emergency decontamination is conducted by using copious amounts of water to dilute the
agent in order to evacuate the personnel to medical aid as quickly as possible. Once the
technical and/or MCD lanes have been established, the emergency decontamination
corridor may no longer be required.
      c.    Technical decontamination is set up next for responders who have specialized
PPE that requires a higher percentage of decontamination solution prior to removal. The
technical decontamination corridor is usually set up by the emergency responders. The
technical decontamination corridor is located where other evacuees would not confuse it
with emergency decontamination or MCD. Entry into the technical decontamination
corridor is limited to responders only. Evacuees are directed to the emergency
decontamination corridor or MCD corridor.
      d.   The MCD corridor may be the last corridor set up and is normally set up by
emergency responders tasked to provide MCD. This is a large-scale decontamination
corridor designed to process large numbers of personnel in a short amount of time. In some
situations, an MCD corridor may not be required to conduct CBRN CM operations. For
example, an incident that involved only first and emergency responders would not
necessarily require an MCD corridor. A patient decontamination corridor is similar to the
MCD corridor, except that it would normally be established adjacent to an MTF.
2.    Emergency Decontamination
      Emergency decontamination removes contamination from personnel quickly in order
to save lives, minimize casualties, and limit the spread of contamination. It facilitates rapid
medical attention without transferring the contamination to other personnel or equipment.
The procedures outlined below apply when the type of hazard is unknown. Adjustments to
the steps may be made if and when the hazard is known (for example, the material reacts
in a caustic manner when it comes in contact with water, rapidity of hazard effect on the



1 April 2008     FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                       D-1
skin dictates contaminated clothing be removed prior to the people being sprayed down, or
biological and radiological decontamination requirements differ from chemical and TIM
situations). Additional modifications regarding the placement of the decontamination
corridor may be needed for incidents that occur during cold weather operations. Figure D-1
provides an example of emergency decontamination operations.

      a.    Casualty Collection Point (CCP). A CCP is established in the warm zone adjacent
to the hot zone. All casualties are moved to the collection point. Medical personnel conduct
initial triage at this location. Casualties that require EMT are directed or moved to the
contaminated emergency medical treatment station for lifesaving procedures. All other
casualties are directed to the decontamination lane.
     b.   Decontaminants. Decontaminants used are safe for use on skin and wounds.
Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological,
and Nuclear Decontamination provides information on individual emergency
decontamination procedures.
      c.         Emergency Decontamination Supported by Firefighting Equipment.
          (1) Resources. The employment of resources that can dispense large amounts of
water significantly increases the number of personnel that can be decontaminated. Very
large volumes of water are needed for these operations, and control of runoff will be limited.
However, the level of contamination will be reduced through dilution achieved during the
process.
          (2) Decontamination Corridor. A decontamination corridor is established using
means such as fire hydrants, fire hoses, and nozzles; pumper trucks; or fire trucks with
ladder pipes. In each case, the nozzles should be adjusted to produce a low-pressure fan


D-2                         FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                                                          1 April 2008
spray. When possible, two or more systems should be used to increase the volume of water
and spray area to increase the casualty flow rate through the lane. Time permitting and
equipment available, a screen should be positioned to create a lane for males and a lane for
females and small children. The screen should be of sufficient height and length to provide
privacy between the two lanes. Privacy covers may also be positioned to separate the
shower areas from the undress and re-dress areas.
                 (a) Fire Hydrant, Fire Hoses, and Nozzles. When setting up fire hydrants,
fire hoses, and nozzles, platform trucks are needed to elevate the hoses and nozzle
assemblies above ground level. Adjust the nozzle to a low pressure (50-80 pounds per
square inch) spray pattern to allow the casualties to move under the water spray. The hose
should be positioned in a manner that will not create a tripping hazard for casualties.
               (b) Pumper Trucks. When setting up pumper trucks, the pumper cannon
and hoses can be used to establish the water spray areas.
                (c) Ladder Pipe Decontamination. When setting up trucks with ladder
pipes, the ladder pipes are elevated above ground level to produce a low-pressure spray
pattern. The nozzle pressure should be between 50 and 80 pounds per square inch (normal
household shower pressure).
3.    Technical Decontamination
     Technical decontamination is conducted during a CBRN CM response, where trained
responders conduct operations to mitigate the hazards. The incident may be accident- or
terrorist-related, and it can involve CBRN or TIM hazards, or a combination. Responders
may be required to use supplied air respirators, such as SCBA or rebreathers, and fully
encapsulated, splash-resistant protective suits.
     a.   The planning and execution of technical decontamination operations requires
incorporation of different strategies than those used for military-specific operations.
Consider the following actions when planning for technical decontamination:
           (1) Direct the decontamination process toward confinement of the contaminant
within the hot zone and the decontamination corridor. Consider the potential effects of the
decontamination process on responder personnel when developing the decontamination
plan, and establish countermeasures (such as adequate work/rest cycles).
           (2) Determine proper decontamination methods and procedures prior to an
incident as part of the overall preincident planning, hazard assessment, and risk evaluation
process. Do not permit entry into the hot zone until the appropriate decontamination
methods and procedures have been established.
     b.    Technical decontamination requires a step-by-step process to reduce
contamination on responder personnel to a safe level and to prevent the transfer of
contamination outside the containment area. The procedures used are based on field
analyses of the hazards and risks involved. Field analyses consist of checking detection
results and using technical reference sources to determine the general hazards, such as
flammability and toxicity, and then evaluating the relative risks associated with the
contaminants (for example, vapor versus liquid, blister versus nerve agents, and
radiological versus CB hazards).
     c.   Technical decontamination can be accomplished in several ways, depending on
the hazard. Typically, it consists of a wet decontamination in which the individual is



1 April 2008    FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                       D-3
flushed with water to remove or dilute the contaminants. A dry decontamination, such as
brushing and scraping, is an appropriate alternative for other contamination removal
(physical radioactive-contaminated particles). Other considerations, such as the hazard’s
reactivity with water and its solubility, are factors in determining the appropriate
decontamination method.
      d.   Technical decontamination may consist of one or more stations, depending on the
hazard. The decontamination team must be available to supervise the operation and assist
in the processing of personnel. The team is trained to help personnel decontaminate their
outer clothing from top to bottom (always moving the contaminants toward the ground).
Low-pressure water should be used and overspraying or splashing should be kept to a
minimum to control the spread of contaminants. The decontamination site should be
established in an area where contaminated runoff can be controlled. Figure D-2 shows an
example of a technical decontamination operation.
NOTE: The number of stations required for technical decontamination will vary
depending on factors such as the type of agent and the weather.

      e.   The entry point is clearly designated and identifies the beginning of the
decontamination corridor. Responders know the location of the technical decontamination
corridor prior to entering the hot zone. The purpose of the entry point is to ensure that all
personnel leaving the hot zone process through the decontamination corridor, thereby
controlling the spread of contamination. At the entry point, two separate lanes are set up—
the primary decontamination lane and an emergency decontamination lane. The
decontamination corridor has two main contamination control areas—the liquid control
area and the vapor control area.



D-4                       FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                                                     1 April 2008
      f.   The primary decontamination lane requires only those stations necessary to
accomplish effective decontamination of response personnel. The basic goal is to eliminate
the contaminant in a safe and appropriate manner. Each station should be manned by
properly equipped individuals trained to direct and assist personnel in the decontamination
process. An emergency decontamination lane is used when a responder requires immediate
evacuation or medical attention. When the emergency lane requires activation, normal
decontamination operations stop until the situation is mitigated. Normal operations resume
once the victim has been safely processed through the emergency lane of the technical
decontamination corridor.
           (1) Equipment Drop. The equipment drop may consist of a tarp or table for the
placement of all equipment used in the hot zone. The equipment drop serves a dual
purpose. It ensures that all potentially contaminated equipment stays within the
contaminated area, and it allows the equipment to be operationally decontaminated and
reused by those reentering the hot zone. This minimizes the amount of equipment brought
into the hot zone that requires later decontamination or disposal.
           (2) PPE Decontamination. Removing gross contamination from boots and
gloves (the primary places generally contaminated) prior to starting the decontamination
process helps control the spread of contamination. Scrubbing boots and gloves using long-
handled brushes with buckets or step pans filled with decontaminant is one method used to
accomplish gross removal of contaminants.
           (3) Monitoring Point. Personnel should be monitored for any residual
contamination once the decontaminant application and rinsing are complete. Monitors such
as individual chemical agent monitors, radiac meters, and commercial instruments can be
used to perform this function if the hazard is known. When working with an unknown
substance or without monitoring devices, visual observation of obvious signs and symptoms
of exposure provide an alternative monitoring method. If the contamination is still present
following decontamination (visually observed or detected by monitoring devices), affected
personnel should be returned to the beginning of the decontamination lane to repeat the
procedure, with specific attention paid to the areas observed or noted by detection devices.
           (4) Protective Clothing Removal. Personnel should be assisted in removing
their protective suits prior to crossing the liquid control line when monitoring indicates
contamination is not present. During removal of the protective suit in Level B, an attendant
is required to hold the SCBA while the protective suit is removed. The attendant will
maintain control of the respirator until it is removed at Station 5. Decontamination team
members ensure that they touch only the outside of the suit. Personnel inside the suit
assist with the removal, touching only the inside of the suit. Decontamination personnel
then contain the suit in a thick plastic bag for further disposition after all personnel are
decontaminated.
NOTE: Personal clothing removal, shower and re-dress may be unnecessary if
contamination did not penetrate the protective clothing. Monitoring equipment
should be used to verify if any contamination has penetrated the protective suit.
           (5) Clothing/Respirator Removal. Personnel remove the clothing worn under
their protective suit and place it in a thick plastic bag for further disposition by the
decontamination team. The respirator is removed from their back, if necessary, and the
attendant takes control of the backpack. Prior to removing their face piece, personnel close
their eyes and hold their breath. They will remove and release their face piece as they cross


1 April 2008    FM 3-11.21/MCRP 3-37.2C/NTTP 3-11.24/AFTTP(I) 3-2.37                      D-5
the contamination control line, entering the cold zone. The attendant will place the
respirator in a thick plastic bag for further disposition.
            (6) Shower and Re-dress. When required, personnel will shower and re-dress
prior to receiving postentry medical evaluation.
           (7) Medical Evaluation. After responders have entered the hot zone, they
receive a medical evaluation to assist in identifying any health issues that may have
occurred during entry operations.
     g.   The decontamination and monitoring process is unique to each accident/incident.
Decontamination techniques may be physical and/or chemical. The decontamination
methods selected should be tailored to the hazard, on-scene responders, location, and
equipment available. No matter which method is used, the outcome should be the
elimination or reduction of contamination to a safe level while confining the hazard to the
hot zone and decontamination corridor.
4.    Mass Casualty Decontamination
      a.   Site Setup.
            (1) Military personnel responsible for MCD may provide support to existing
civilian-led ambulatory and nonambulatory decontamination lanes.
           (2) Alternately, military responders conducting MCD may be responsible for
establishing the MCD site.
           (3)   In either case, military unit C2 remains in place.
           (4) The military leadership coordinates with the appropriate official (as part of
a site survey) to select a site that is upwind and uphill from the contamination sources.
           (5)   The site should have an ample water supply, good drainage, and vehicle
access.
         (6) Planning determines where the stations are established to support
ambulatory and litter decontamination.
           (7)   The decontamination team leadership lays out the site and—
           •     Reviews the outline for hot, warm, and cold zones.
           •     Establishes entry and exit points.
           •     Establishes liquid and VCLs.
           •     Identifies runoff control procedures.
           •     Determines the need for protection, when required.
      b.   Operations. The team establishes an MCD site. Resources are assigned to
complete each task (by station) for casualty decontamination operations. A C2 element
provides supervision at the MCD site. The C2 element maintains communications with
operating personnel in the cold, warm, and hot zones. The C2 element prioritizes and
provides additional resources (when needed). The procedures outlined below apply when
the type of hazard is unknown. Adjustments to the steps may be made if and when the
hazard is known (for example, the material reacts in a caustic manner when it comes in
contact with water, rapidity of hazard effect on the skin dictates contaminated clothing be

removed prior to the people being sprayed down, or biological and radiological
decontamination requirements differ from chemical and TIM situations). Additional
modifications regarding the placement of the decontamination corridor may be needed for
incidents that occur during cold weather operations. Casualty decontamination operations
are described in the following paragraphs. See FM 4-02.7; FM 8-500, Hazardous Materials

depending on factors such as the number and type of injuries, agent used, and
weather. Not all stations described in this section may be required.
            (1) Casualty Collection Point. Tasks at this point include casualty collection,
log-in, and preparation for triage. Crowd control may also be required to handle potentially
hostile victims. At this station, casualties are received and quickly assessed and prioritized
by medical personnel, and ambulatory casualties are segregated from nonambulatory
casualties. Ambulatory casualties are directed to the triage station, and nonambulatory
casualties are transported to the triage station by litter bearers. A minimum of two
augmentees should be used at this station. Other tasks accomplished at this point are listed
below:
NOTE: When moving casualties, ensure that an appropriate number of personnel are used
to prevent further injuries.

                 (a) Triage. Tasks at this station require performance by medical personnel.
Casualties are triaged and assigned treatment priorities by medical personnel assigned to
the CCP.
                (b) Emergency Medical Treatment Area (such as hemorrhage control). At
least one medical treatment provider is required at this station.
                  (c) Casualty Log-In (Warm Zone). An MCD attendant logs in casualties
and identifies valuables and items that generally cannot be decontaminated. The attendant
assigns each casualty a number, prepares a record for each casualty processed, and
identifies the casualty’s personal property and entry medical condition, as determined by
the triage officer. Official documentation of the care provided is maintained. One person is
required for operations at this station.
                (d) Contaminated Waste Holding Area. The hazardous waste site is
established during setup and maintained by logistic personnel for receipt of contaminated
waste. The station attendants deploy contaminated waste receptacles in the
decontamination corridor, prepare and clearly mark the waste collection point, protect the
ground with tarps, secure contaminated material in heavy plastic bags, and control
contaminated drainage from decontaminated clothing.
                (e) Personal Property Receipt. The log-in station properly receives and
accounts for personal property and determines its decontamination priority. The personal
property and equipment decontamination sites are established adjacent to the casualty
decontamination lanes. Decontamination of these items may occur as items are received or
they may be held for later processing. One station attendant supports this operation.
Personal property is retrieved from individual bags and neutralizing solution is applied to
the items. The station attendant allows ample time for the decontamination solution to
function and then forwards the items for a contamination check. The station operator
checks for completeness of decontamination prior to transfer back to the casualty.
NOTE: Wet down hair and clothing with water mist prior to undressing during
biological and radiological incidents.
          (2) MCD Operations. These warm zone decontamination operations are
subdivided into a series of steps that generally involve undressing and showering and
should remove most of the contamination from casualties.
                (a) Emergency Decontamination. Emergency decontamination procedures
are conducted by medical personnel (for open wounds, burns, and wet-down) prior to
casualties processing through the MCD corridor.
                (b)   Ambulatory Decontamination.
                 •       Clothing and Personal Items Removal. The operator receives
casualties and directs them to remove their clothing. Some casualties may require
assistance in clothing removal. The operator should have cutting devices (scissors or a
safety knife) to aid in clothing removal. Pressure bandages and splints are not removed—
clothing is cut around them and any material under the bandage or splint is left in place.
One person should be used at the clothing removal station.
               •       Contaminant Removal and Shower. The operator receives casualties
and leads them to the shower. The operator instructs the casualty on shower procedures to
reassure the casualty. The casualty is placed in the center of the shower with hands and

arms raised to allow water flow to all parts of the body, medical condition permitting. If
sponges are available, have the casualty sponge the skin from head to toe. If the casualty
cannot raise his arms and hands, the attendant should make efforts to ensure that the
water reaches areas covered by the arms. The attendant turns the water on and directs
upper nozzles to the head, directs side sprayers to the sheltered portions of the body, and
ensures that the bandage/splint is thoroughly soaked. The attendant stops the water flow
when the casualty is thoroughly washed and directs the casualty to the next station. One
person is required at each wash station.
                •     Monitoring Point. Casualties are monitored for completeness of
decontamination, and their status is recorded on a decontamination card. One station
attendant is required at this station.
                     (c)   Nonambulatory Decontamination.
                   •    Clothing and Personal Items Removal. The operator receives a litter
casualty. Using a cutting device, the station operator cuts away the casualty's clothing. One
person per patient is required at each litter stand setup. The operator requests assistance;
lifts the casualty, using a four-person lift technique; and transfers the casualty to a clean
litter. A litter transfer team carries the litter casualty to the clothing removal station.
Casualties are placed, head first, on the roller system and rolled under the shower.
NOTE: Medical personnel monitor casualties at all stages of the decontamination
process—looking for indications of hypothermia, managing bandages and splints,
and providing EMT, as needed.
                •    Contaminant Removal and Shower. The supporting wash team
showers the casualty with water from shower nozzles and side sprayers. The casualty is
rolled slowly through the shower allowing ample time for complete gross contamination
removal. Two station attendants should support this operation.
               •     Monitoring Point. At this station, casualties are monitored for
completeness of decontamination, and their status is recorded on a decontamination card.
Three station attendants should be used at this station.
          (3) MCD Re-dress Area (Cold Zone). The casualty is provided a covering, such
as a medical gown, sheet, poncho, or disposable wrap, prior to proceeding to the medical
evaluation and clean treatment area.
               (4)   MCD Medical Evaluation (Cold Zone). Tasks accomplished include the
following:
               (a) Conduct Postdecontamination Triage. At this station, casualties are
thoroughly assessed by a medical augmentee without the limitations imposed by operating
in PPE.
                (b) Provide Postdecontamination Emergency Medical Treatment.
Operations at this station allow for medical interventions without PPE limitations.
                (c) Transport Casualties. Casualties are consolidated at this point and
medically evacuated or transported to a supporting MTF. When medical staff is available,
casualties are monitored during the transportation process to ensure that their health
status remains stable.

6.      Logistics
     Logistics serves to revitalize units that have expended valuable resources during the
conduct of CBRN CM. During recovery, units use logistical operations to prepare for future
missions.
     a.    Logistic recovery operations following a CBRN CM operation should recover,
restore, reoutfit, and sustain the unit in preparation for follow-on missions. Common
recovery functions include the following:
              (1)    PPE maintenance and resupply.
              (2)    Equipment decontamination, maintenance, calibration, and expendables
resupply.

               (3)   Postincident medical screening.
      b.  The checklist at Table D-2 is provided to assist in logistic recovery operations
after a CBRN CM operation. This checklist should be used as a supplement to unit SOPs.
                         Table D-2. Personal Protective Equipment Checklist
          PPE Item                                            Recovery Procedures
    Level A                 Uncontaminated suits should be turned inside out, placed on hanger assemblies,
    Protective Suits        and then suspended on racks or heavy duty hangars for sanitizing. One ounce of
                            disinfecting solution and 24 ounces of mild liquid detergent mixed in a gallon of
                            water is applied to the entire interior of the suit and allowed a contact time of 10
                            minutes. The suit is thoroughly rinsed with water and allowed to air-dry. After
                            drying, it is returned to its original configuration (right side out). In the event the
                            exterior of the suit requires cleaning it is washed as necessary with a sponge and
                            allowed to air-dry. Each suit is thoroughly inspected for serviceability and
                            damage. The individual performing the inspection records the results of this
                            inspection on a Suit Inspection Log. The suit is then folded properly and placed in
                            its assigned storage bag. Each bag is brushed with a stiff bristle brush to remove
                            any dirt that may have accumulated.
    Protective Boots        The boots are deposited in a warm soapy water solution, allowed to soak for 10
                            minutes, and then rinsed thoroughly in warm water. A soft bristle brush may be
                            required to remove any soil buildup on the boots. Allow the boots to air-dry
                            upside down until thoroughly dry.
    Protective Gloves       The gloves are deposited in a warm soapy water solution, allowed to soak for 10
                            minutes, and then rinsed thoroughly in warm water. Allow the gloves to air-dry
                            until the inside and outside are thoroughly dry.
    SCBA                    All SCBA models consist of a cylinder for storing compressed breathing air, a
                            harness and back frame assembly to support the equipment on the body of the
                            wearer, and a face piece assembly. All these items are generally contained in a
                            hardened plastic case that is cleaned by wiping with a clean, wet cloth and
                            allowed to air-dry. All other components are addressed separately in the following
                            paragraphs.
    SCBA Air Cylinder       Before use, cylinders are visually inspected for dents or gouges in the metal or in
                            composite wrapping. Cylinders which show damage such as gouges or dents are
                            removed from service and emptied of compressed air. The cylinders are wiped
                            free of any dirt that may have accumulated during use. The hydrostatic test date
                            is checked for validity.
    SCBA Harness and        Each harness and back frame assembly is checked visually for worn and/or
    Back Frame              frayed straps, aging rubber parts, workable buckles, and any damages that the
    Assembly                harness and back frame assembly and/or components may have. Any dirt that
                            may have accumulated on the assembly/component is wiped free by hand.
                            Damaged harness and backpack frame assemblies should be turned in for
                            repair.
    SCBA Face Piece         Most SCBA face pieces require that you remove the breathing regulator from the
                            face piece. Face pieces are cleaned by immersing them in a solution of warm
                            soapy water followed by rinsing in clear water. Allow a 10 minute contact time
                            before rinsing. Rinse with drinking water using a spray bottle or gently running
                            water. Prepare a disinfectant solution to kill germs. Two tablespoons of bleach
                            per gallon of water is a suitable disinfectant. Other commercially available
                            disinfectants can be used if the manufacturer recommends them. Disinfectant
                            wipes (70% isopropyl alcohol) can also be used as a disinfectant. Shake excess
                            water from the face piece, and if time permits, hang it until dry; if time does not
                            permit, then dry with a clean, lint-free cloth or gently blow dry with clean, dry
                            breathing air of 30 pounds per square inch or less pressure. After drying, the face
                            piece and breathing regulator are reconnected. Damaged face pieces are sent to
                            an authorized maintenance facility for repair.

             PPE Item                                         Recovery Procedures
       Air Purifying           Remove any filters or cartridges. Filters and cartridges should not be washed.
       Respirators             Discard any filters that are clogged or cartridges that are spent. Disassemble
                               valves and other reusable face piece parts. Wash the face piece and associated
                               parts with a mild detergent and warm water. Do not use organic solvents. A soft
                               bristle brush may be used to remove any heavy debris. Rinse the respirator face
                               piece and parts in clean, warm water. Prepare a disinfectant solution to kill
                               germs. Two tablespoons of bleach per gallon of water is a suitable disinfectant.
                               Other commercially available disinfectants can be used if the manufacturer
                               recommends them. Disinfectant wipes (70% isopropyl alcohol) can also be used
                               as a disinfectant. Immerse the face piece and parts in the disinfectant solution
                               for 2 minutes; then rinse with clean, warm water and air-dry overnight. After
                               drying, reassemble the respirator. When not in use, the respirator and cartridges
                               are kept in a sealed container and stored in a clean, dry, temperate,
                               noncontaminated environment. It is especially important to keep gas and vapor
                               cartridges in a sealed container so they do not passively absorb gases and
                               vapors from the storage area, thereby reducing the filter service life. Particulate
                               filters should also be protected from dusts and dirt. Each respirator is inspected
                               routinely before and after each use and discarded if found unserviceable, such
                               as exposure to liquid chemical contamination.
       Cooling Vests          Cooling vests are visually inspected for damages and cleanliness. Any soiled or
                              damaged vest is laundered and repaired.
       Cooling Vest Inserts   Inserts are visually inspected for tears, leaks, or any other type of damage.
                              Damaged inserts will be turned in for disposal. Maintenance is limited to gently
                              washing undamaged inserts in warm soapy water, rinsing, and then placing them
                              in storage (freezer) for future use.

7.      Transition Operations
      Military response assets will transition to their home station after they are properly
relieved from the mission or civilian authorities no longer require their assistance. Proper
notification of and approval by the unit’s higher headquarters should initiate the transition
operations.
