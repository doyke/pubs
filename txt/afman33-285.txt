                                            Chapter 1

     OBJECTIVES, GOAL, REQUIREMENTS, ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Objectives. The objective of this manual is to identify AF requirements, roles and
responsibilities regarding implementation of DoD Directive 8570.01, Information Assurance
(IA) Training, Certification and Workforce Management, dated August 15, 2004 and DoD
Directive 8570.01-M, Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program, dated
December 19, 2005 (including Change 1 dated May 15, 2008). DoDD 8570.01 states, in part,
that all authorized users of DoD Information Systems (IS) shall receive initial Information
Awareness orientation as a condition of access to an Information System (IS), and thereafter
must complete annual IA awareness refresher training. This manual is inclusive of identifying
IA certification requirements, training personnel, certifying personnel, ensuring policies and
records are updated, and reporting IA workforce data. Additional requirements exist for AF
personnel, DoD civilians, local nationals, foreign nationals, and contractors with Information
Assurance responsibilities. These personnel shall be certified for those positions and
accordingly:
   1.1.1. AF privileged IS users (an authorized user who has access to system control,
   monitoring, administration, criminal investigation, or compliance functions) and IA
   managers shall be fully qualified to DoD baseline requirements to perform their IA duties,
   which include certification(s).
   1.1.2. All AF positions involved in the performance of IA functions shall be identified in
   appropriate manpower/personnel databases by category and level.
   1.1.3. AF personnel performing IA management functions or privileged user functions,
   regardless of civilian job series or military specialty, shall be appropriately identified in AF
   personnel databases.
   1.1.4. All AF IA personnel shall be identified, tracked, and managed so that IA positions are
   staffed with trained and certified personnel by category, level, and functions.
   1.1.5. The status of the AF IA certification and training shall be monitored and reported as
   an element of mission readiness and as a management review item.
1.2. Goal. The goal of the Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program is to
―develop a DoD IA workforce with a common understanding of the concepts, principles, and
applications of IA for each category, level, and function to enhance protection and availability of
DoD information, information systems, and networks‖ as stated in DoD 8570.01-M. DoD
8570.01-M lays out intermediate milestones in meeting the certification requirements. The
Components must meet 10% certified by the end of the first calendar year after implementation
and 30% each calendar year thereafter until 100% certified. This manual is an extension of DoD
Directive 8570.01 and DoD Manual 8570.01-M, which can be located at
http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/. DoD directives and IA workforce duties within the AF, as
well as the AF‘s role as executive agent for specific Combatant Commands (COCOM), requires
an understanding of this mandate to properly implement. There are two categories of IA
professionals: Information Assurance Technical (IAT) and Information Assurance Management
(IAM) to include the Designated Accrediting Authority (DAA). Additionally, there are two
 4                                                               AFMAN 33-285 17 JUNE 2011


specialities of IA professionals: Computer-Network Defense - Service Providers (CND-SPs) and
IA System Architects and Engineers (IASAEs). There are three levels of control or access:
Computing Environment, Network, and Enclave.
1.3. Requirements. The AF will continue to meet and maintain initial and annual IA awareness
training as prescribed in DoD 8570.01-M and the AF implementation of IA certifications will
follow DoD guidance with a phased approach. The MAJCOMs and COCOMs (whom the Air
Force is executive agent for) are required to put IA workforce requirements in manpower
databases, ensure personnel are trained and certified, record certified personnel and certifications
in personnel systems, track and ensure certifications are current, as well as report certification
status to SAF/A6O until manual reporting is replaced with an automated system. Certification
currency requirements are mandated by ISO/IEC 17024, the certification is valid for 3 years and
then must be re-validated based on the specific vendor requirements. The IA workforce
information will be recorded in the manpower and personnel databases (e.g., MILPDS and
DCPDS) for availability to the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) and includes any AF
Specialty Code or civilian Occupational Series performing IA functions listed in DoD 8570.01-
M, and should not be constrained to the Communications and Information (C&I) specialties. All
IA workforce requirements, to include currency, for contractors will be recorded in their
Performance-Based Work Statement (PWS) and details of the contractor IA workforce will need
to be manually collected until an automated solution is available.
1.4. Roles and Responsibilities. The AF recognizes the following agencies will provide
support as listed in DoD 8570.01-M: The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and
Information Integration/Department of Defense Chief Information Officer [ASD (NII)/DoD
CIO] will provide overarching IA policy and guidance. They will coordinate the implementation
and sustainment requirements of DoD 8570.01-M to include supporting tools and resources (e.g.,
conferences, websites, database integration, workforce identification, etc.). In addition, the
Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness [USD (P&R)] will support and provide
appropriate representation to the USD (P&R) IA Training, Certification, and Workforce
Management Oversight Advisory Council. Director of the Defense Information Systems Agency
(DISA) is required to coordinate with the Defense-wide Information Assurance Program office
and the components to develop and maintain online resources correlating DoD IA training
products and classes. In addition, they will provide information correlating IA functional
requirements to workforce categories and levels to core IA training curriculum. Through the
USD (P&R), the Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support (DANTES) will
manage the required certification testing process. The AF organizational responsibilities in this
AF Manual are defined in AFI 33-200, Information Assurance Management.
     1.4.1. Secretary of the Air Force, Office of Information Dominance and Air Force Chief

   including examining all available information and supporting evidence or artifacts related to
   an incident or event.‖
   2.1.14. CND-SP Auditor (CND-AU). ―CND-AU personnel perform assessments of systems
   and networks within the NE or enclave and identify where those systems/networks deviate
   from acceptable configurations, enclave policy, or local policy.‖
   2.1.15. CND-SP Manager (CND-SPM). ―CND-SPMs oversee the CND-SP operations
   within their organization. CND-SPMs are responsible for producing guidance for their NE or
   enclave, assisting with risk assessments and risk management for organizations within their
   NE or enclave, and are responsible for managing the technical classifications within their
   organization.‖
2.2. Primary, Additional, or Embedded Duty. In addition to identifying the category and
level for each IA workforce position, it must be determined if the requirement is a primary,
additional, or embedded duty. It is recommended to minimize the number of additional and
embedded positions by consolidating workload to a primary function. Appendix 1 of DoD
8570.01-M provides the following definitions:
   2.2.1. Primary. An IA position with primary duties focused on IA functions. The position
   may have other duties assigned, but the main effort focuses on IA functions. On average, the
   position requires at least 25 to 40(+) hours per week devoted to IA functions.‖
   2.2.2. Additional. A position requiring a significant portion of the incumbent‘s attention and
   energies to be focused on IA functions, but in which IA functions are not the primary
   responsibility. On average, the position requires 15 to 24, out of a 40(+) hour week, devoted
   to IA functions.‖
   2.2.3. Embedded. A position with IA functions identified as an integral part of other major
   assigned duties. On average, the position requires up to 14 hours, out of a 40(+) hour week
   devoted to IA related functions.‖
2.3. Recording the Information Assurance Workforce Position Requirement. The IA
workforce category, level, and number of hours performed must be recorded. See Chapter 7 of
DoD 8570.01-M for more details. The following paragraphs explain responsibilities within the
Air Force for recording IA workforce requirements.
   2.3.1. Civilians. Civilian (to include local and foreign nationals) IA certification
   requirements must be recorded in the position description and within the Defense Civilian
   Personnel Data System (DCPDS).
       2.3.1.1. Coordinate position description changes with the local civilian manpower liaison
       and union representative, as applicable. ―New hire civilians and contractor personnel
AFMAN 33-285 17 JUNE 2011                                                                    17


       must agree as a ―condition of employment‖ that they will obtain the appropriate
       certification for the position to be filled‖ as per DoD 8570.01-M, para C3.2.4.8.4.
       2.3.1.2. Current civilian IA coded personnel may be subjected to administrative action if
       they do not attain or maintain training or certification standards.
       2.3.1.3. Submit the following information to the civilian manpower representative for
       further submission to the servicing classification office to update DCPDS: MPCN;
       CPCN; IA category; IA level; identify whether it is a primary, additional, or embedded
       duty; and a position specialty of INFOSEC.
   2.3.2. Military. Military IA certification requirements are currently recorded in MPES until
   another manpower system is available. This is done through the use of SEIs for officer and
   enlisted requirements. MPES only allows for one SEI, thus do NOT replace existing SEIs,
   but continue to train and certify the IA member.
       2.3.2.1. Submit a manpower change request to your local manpower office to include the
       following information: MPCN and one of the following SEIs. (SEIs will continue to be
       updated with applicable AFSCs and the classification directory should always be referred
       to for authoritative data.) See the AFPC website for further directories, which are
       published every quarter.

                               IA WORKFORCE TRAINING

3.1. Training Methodologies. The following training methods are available to DoD military
and civilian personnel only. Contractor personnel must attain training through their company.
An Air Force Job Qualification Standard has been established for recording the WIP training
requirements and certification completion. (AFJQS XXXXX-200N)
   3.1.1. Initial skills. Enlisted Air Force Specialties (2E, 3A, 3C, and 3D) provide training
   towards IA certification, and will receive an in-depth review for certification testing after
   new C&I AFSCs are established. Officers receive initial IA knowledge at the Expeditionary
   Communications Officer Training course. These courses do not currently contain enough
   information for personnel to attain a certification listed within DoD 8570.01-M.
   3.1.2. On-the-job training. IA skills can be gained through on-the-job training.
   3.1.3. Supplemental courses. IA skills can be obtained through supplemental schoolhouse
   courses, such as the Combat Information Transport System courses.
   3.1.4. Distributive learning. Training is available through computer based training (CBT)
   via the AF IT E-Learning website via the AF Portal and the Carnegie MellonVTE website:
   https://www.vte.cert.org. It is also available through Books 24 x 7 on the AF Portal.
   3.1.5. Contracted training. Instructor-led training and virtual instructor-led training is
   available to provide certification specific training. Contact your local training manager and
   your wing IA office for further coordination through Air Force Communications Agency.
   3.1.6. Remedial training.    Remedial training is available through the previously listed
   training methods.
   3.1.7. DAA training. The DAA must attain training through a DAA CBT located on the
   DoD IA Portal: http://iase.disa.mil/index2.html.
AFMAN 33-285 17 JUNE 2011                                                                       19

                            IA WORKFORCE CERTIFICATION

4.1. Preferred Certifications. Personnel assigned to a position requiring certification must
obtain/hold the appropriate certification, or be removed from that duty position (See Figure 4.1).
Once the AF passes the implementation phase, 1 January 2011, members requiring certification
will not be granted unsupervised privileged access until the proper certification is obtained and
will have 6 months to obtain certification. The AF will focus funding on the following
certifications: A+, Network+, Security+, CAP, and CISSP for IAT, IAM, and IA System
Architect and Engineer requirements. The CND-SP certification requirements are in addition to
IAT level certifications, and a preferred certification will be identified after the next 8570.01-M
change occurs to add Certified Ethical Hacker to all CND-SP levels except the CND-SP
Manager. Although the AF funding will go towards the preferred certifications listed previously,
all certifications listed in Figure 4.1 will be recognized. While it is not depicted in Figure 4.1
(DoD has not updated the figure yet) the Certification and Accreditation Professional exam is
approved for IAM Level I and II.

Figure 4.1. DoD Baseline Certifications.




4.2. Testing. Once a DoD civilian or military IA member is considered trained and successfully
meets the minimum passing score on a pre-assessment exam, they will be issued a certification
voucher. If the individual received Instructor Led Training (ILT) they are to test within 30 days
 20                                                             AFMAN 33-285 17 JUNE 2011


of non-CISSP course completion. Personnel will test within 60 days of CISSP course
completion. The voucher is utilized to obtain access to a certification test and will have an
expiration        date.            These      vouchers      are      currently       located    at
https://private.afca.af.mil/optn/tng/vilt/voucher. The member will be provided instructions on
the testing location (possibly an education office) and any requirements for the certification
(CISSP requires an application and A+ requires two tests). ―All personnel must agree to release
their certification qualification(s) to the Department of Defense,‖ as stated in DoD 8570.01-M,
release of certification is a requirement in order to stay eligible for the position. This process
supports validation of information contained within AF personnel systems and DMDC personnel
systems. Ultimately this information will be fed directly from DMDC to the Air Force personnel
systems.
4.3. Certification Test Failure. This section applies to personnel who fail IA certification
exams and/or become decertified while performing IA duties, IAW DoD Manual 8570.01
Information Assurance (IA) Workforce Improvement Program, regardless of AFSC or civilian
status. Attachment 3 shows the guidance in a table format.
   4.3.1. Military Personnel. Military personnel who fail their initial IA certification will be
   placed in remedial supervised training (CBTs, hands-on training, etc.) and will not be
   allowed to perform IA duties without direct supervision from someone who is IA certified.
   Supervisors will document and certify the individual‘s training progress which will include
   the trainee‘s understanding of the course content, motivation level and study habits. The
   supervisor will validate the trainee‘s readiness for retesting by requiring them to take and
   pass a ―pre assessment‖ exam and ensuring the person is scheduled to retake the certification
   examination within 60 days. If the person fails to pass their second certification exam, the
   commander will meet with both the supervisor and trainee to reassess whether the individual
   possesses the necessary skills to perform in an IA position. This assessment will include but
   is not limited to an individual‘s aptitude, motivation, experience, and knowledge level to
   perform in an IA coded position. If the person is performing IA as a secondary duty, then
   those IA responsibilities will be reassigned to someone who is certified to perform those
   functions. Upon the commander‘s recommendation, the supervisor will ensure the individual
   is scheduled for instructor-led training (ILT) through their MAJCOM/FOA/DRU‘s IA
   manager. Should the individual fail to pass their certification test after receiving ILT, the
   individual will be removed from performing any further IA duties. The commander will
   determine whether the trainee should be retrained or take other appropriate personnel action.
   4.3.2. Civilian Personnel. The commander will determine appropriate actions based on the
   employee‘s position (primary or additional duty) IAW local civilian personnel policy.
   Department of Air Force civilian employees performing IA duties are divided into two
   categories:
       4.3.2.1. Primary Duty. Employees in positions for which ensuring information security
       is their primary duty. These positions are typically located in communications squadrons
       and in the 2210 series with the parenthetical title of INFOSEC or SECURITY. Positions
       within the 335 series may also have this requirement. Employees in this category have
       (or will have) the IA certification as a condition of employment. If these individuals fail
       to pass IA certification, the supervisor will immediately contact the Civilian Personnel
       Office and local procedures will be followed.
AFMAN 33-285 17 JUNE 2011                                                                           21


       4.3.2.2. Additional Duty. Employees in a position where they have been granted system
       authorizations/access as an additional duty; where the additional duty is not specifically
       tied to the position. If these employees fail to pass their initial IA certification, those
       additional duties will be reassigned and the commander/supervisor has the option to
       schedule the employee for ILT through his MAJCOM‘s IA manager. Should the
       individual fail to pass their certification test after receiving ILT, the individual will not be
       reassigned IA additional duties. See attachment 3 for further guidance.
   4.3.3. Contractors. Contractor personnel must meet certification requirements as outlined in
   their contract and will not be assigned nor perform any IA duties in which they are not
   certified. Any issues concerning contract IA certification requirements should be addressed
   through the local contracting office.
   4.3.4. Personnel will not perform IA duties unless they are qualified and certified to perform
   the duties. Those that become decertified or fail certification exams must take immediate
   actions to reacquire the necessary training/certification(s). This initiative will require
   commander and supervisor involvement to ensure we have a capable and sustainable cadre of
   IA certified professionals.
4.4. Privileged Access Agreement. Chapter 2, para C2.1.4 of DoD 8570.01-M states, ―as a
condition of privileged access to any information system, personnel performing IA functions
described in this Manual must satisfy both preparatory and sustaining DoD IA training and
certification requirements (see Chapters 3-5). Additionally, personnel with privileged access
must complete a ‗Privileged Access Agreement,‘ a sample of which is shown in Appendix 4.
DoD Components may expand the requirements of this agreement to meet their needs.‖ This
document shall be maintained in the member‘s training records until the DAA for that IS
identifies a separate method for recording and is applicable to DoD civilians, military, and
contractors.
4.5. Maintenance of Certification. Some vendors require continuing education to stay current
with their certification, and may include a maintenance fee while others require a re-test every 2
to 3 years. These requirements will be more clearly defined by sponsoring vendors and must be
met by certified personnel to meet recertification requirements. IA workforce members must
maintain currency on their certification, while filling an IA position. Certification maintenance
fees and retesting costs will only be funded by Air Staff for members currently residing in an IA
workforce position matching to the certification held, and upon acknowledgement of the
certification via the DMDC website.
4.6. Recording Certification Completion. Personnel must complete the appropriate paperwork
to ensure their IA certification completion is recorded in the personnel database.
   4.6.1. Civilians. Civilian personnel complete Optional Form 612 to indicate the award of a
   certification and forward to the servicing civilian classification office.  If serviced by
   AFMA, fax it to DSN 665-2937 or Commercial 210-565-2937 and add a note to remind
   AFMA to record this certification completion within the recently established information
   assurance categories.
   4.6.2. Military. Military personnel (officers and enlisted) complete IMT 2096 to indicate
   award of the SEI for each respective IA certification, as indicated in the Enlisted or Officer
   Classification Directory. Once the supervisor and commander sign the form, it is submitted
 22                                                         AFMAN 33-285 17 JUNE 2011


   to the appropriate military personnel office for assignment to member‘s personnel record.
   Note: This process is being used until the new personnel database has the appropriate data
   fields to record the details of the certification.
4.7. Community College of the Air Force Credit. An individuals IA certification may be
accepted for credit at the Community College of the Air Force, as applicable with the degree
requirements. Contact your education office to verify the applicability to your AFSC.
AFMAN 33-285 17 JUNE 2011                                                                     23

                            IA WORKFORCE DEPLOYMENTS

5.1. Unit Type Code (UTC). Each military member assigned to an UTC where the Mission
Capability Statement states IA responsibilities for the computing environment, network
environment or enclave environment shall meet the IA certification requirements as indicated in
DoD 8570.01-M.
5.2. Line Remark. Deployment line remarks will be established for each category and level of
IA certification to allow the combatant commanders the flexibility in identifying the appropriate
IA workforce requirements in a deployed environment.

          IA WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT, REPORTING, AND METRICS

6.1. Management and Reporting. The Air Force‘s IA workforce shall be managed and
reported through the use of manpower and personnel systems, while contract data is tracked
manually by MAJCOMs. If specific C&I AFSCs are identified as IA workforce, the AFPC
assignment process will manage these assets accordingly.
6.2. Metrics. AFPC and MAJCOM IA offices shall report the status of their IA workforce, as
required by SAF/A6O and MAJCOM IP office.
AFMAN 33-285 17 JUNE 2011                                                                     25

                                           BUDGET

7.1. Funding. The AF received funding for certification expenses based upon an estimated
requirement, through the Office of the Secretary of Defense funding requirement. This budget is
not inclusive of training and will need to be reassessed after position identification has been
completed, and funding for FY12 and after.
7.2. Execution. AFNIC will execute current training funds for the preferred certifications, until
further notice.
7.3. MAJCOM and Unit Training. MAJCOMs and subordinate organizations should budget
for training in addition to the funding available through AFNIC.
