1. General Information. This instruction identifies process changes due to Base Realignment
and Closure 2005 and must be complied with. Major changes include the roles and
responsibilities of the PST/PSS in this process, and the transfer of some material roles from the
AF to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). Also, the Supply Management Activity Group and
the Depot Maintenance Activity Group (DMAG) combined to form the Consolidated
Sustainment Activity Group (CSAG). DIFM/DOTM is the term used to track the issue and turn-
in of exchangeable assets used in the repair of aircraft, engines or other major end items. The
main purpose of the process is to ensure unserviceable assets are returned to the supply chain in a
timely manner. Training on DIFM/DOTM using the Depot Maintenance Accounting and
Production System has been placed on the 309 MXW Production Support Office
(309 MXW/OBWP) Workload Analysis & Material SharePoint site in the Material Support
folder                                            located                                        at
https://cs.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/309MXWOPS/IADP/workloading/default.aspx. Throughout
this instruction, the reference website will be referred to as SharePoint.
     1.1. The CSAG funds all budget code ‘8’ items with an ERRC of ‘T’ or ‘C’, and issues them
     to depot maintenance at no initial costs. The cost code, which is used at the time the order is
     processed, will determine how the job order number (JON) is expensed.
     1.2. When an item with an ERRC of ‘T’ or ‘C’ is ordered and issued with a document
     identifier of a D7R and a cost code of ‘B’, ‘K’ or ‘E’, a DIFM detail suspense record is
     established in the Automated Bill of Material (ABOM) System, and the Wholesale and Retail
     Receiving and Shipping System (WARRS/D035K). When an ERRC ‘T’ or ‘S’ item is
     turned in with a document identifier of a D6R and the cost code is ‘B’, ‘K’ or ‘C’, a credit
309MXWI23-101 17 May 2012                                                                    3


   DIFM detail is established in ABOM and D035K. To clear these records a D7R and D6R
   must be processed in the systems with the same document number.             NOTE:
   WARRS/D035k will be referred to as D035K in this instruction.
       1.2.1. ERRC ‘T’ or ‘C’ with a numeric budget code ‘8’ will be ordered with a cost code
       of ‘B’, and will establish a DIFM detail in the D035K to track the return of the
       unserviceable asset. NOTE: If a ‘K’ is in the fifth position of the stock number, order
       the item with a cost code ‘D’ to bypass the DIFM edits in D035K.
       1.2.2. Items used in the repair of the shop support equipment. For example, a
       maintenance test stand is a piece of support equipment and one of the internal items has
       an ERRC of ‘T’ or ‘C’ and needs to be replaced. This will be ordered using indirect JON
       (X563014SXXXX) and a cost code ‘K’. The cost of the item will be charged to
       maintenance over head, and a DIFM detail will be established in D035K until the
       unserviceable item is turned in.
       1.2.3. ERRC ‘T’ or ‘C’ with alpha budget codes will be ordered with a cost code of ‘E’,
       and will establish a DIFM detail in the D035K.
   1.3. DIFM detail records control and identify DIFM/DOTM items and are linked by the 14-
   digit document number. The turn-in and issue request must contain the same document
   number before the suspended detail record will clear. NOTE: Only one exchangeable item
   will be ordered or turned in per document number.
   1.4. Condition code ‘A’ and Quality Deficiency Report (QDR) condition code ‘Q’ turn-ins
   will be processed in both ABOM and NAVAIR Industrial Material Management System
   (NIMMS). Turn-ins done in ABOM will establish a DIFM/DOTM credit, and turn-ins done
   in NIMMS will credit the JON.
2. Systems. The following systems are used in the processing of DIFM/DOTM items:
   2.1. D035K issues the material to DMAG and maintains accountability of issues, turn-ins,
   and detail records for DIFM/DOTM items.
   2.2. ABOM is used to order and turn-in all material.
   2.3. NIMMS is the accountable system used for the overall management and inventory of
   DMAG owned material. Condition code ‘A’ and ‘Q’ material will be turned into ABOM
   first; then use the established ABOM document number to turn material into NIMMS.
   2.4. The Depot Industrial Financial Management System (DIFMS) is the official financial
   system of records for organic depot maintenance; it expenses the cost of the material to the
   applicable resource control center (RCC) and JON.
3. Policy. The control of DIFM/DOTM assets is a joint responsibility between DLA Aviation
and the 309 MXW groups. This instruction will only address the tasks used to order or turn-in
exchange items.
   3.1. The scheduling supervisor will ensure that all PST/PSSs are knowledgeable of the
   responsibilities for ordering or turning in exchange material outlined in this instruction.
4. Responsibilities.
   4.1. The PST/PSS will:
 4                                                              309MXWI23-101 17 May 2012


        4.1.1. Query D035K RINE screen (attachment 2) for valid credits prior to ordering an
        exchangeable item in ABOM. NOTE: The credit must be in both D035K and ABOM.
        If it is only in ABOM, the credit is invalid and must be deleted unless the item was
        recently turned in and has not had a chance to post in D035K. Contact 309
        MXW/OBWP (production support office) to have the invalid/erroneous credit detail
        deleted from ABOM.
        4.1.2. Process all exchangeable issue requests through the ABOM Exchangeable Module
        Main Menu (Attachment 3, Figures A3.1. through A3.6.). Use the document number
        with the oldest turn-in date for the issue request. NOTE: ABOM maintains a historical
        record of all DIFM/DOTM transactions. The PST/PSS will use the oldest history record
        to match open DIFM/DOTM details for issue or turn-in requests to minimize
        accumulating overage credits.
     4.2. Turn-in of QDR condition code ‘Q’ and serviceable material condition code ‘A’ will be
     processed in ABOM and NIMMS on the NIMMS MN045P screen (Attachment 4). Enter
     the cost of the item that was expensed to JON; the cost can be found in DIFMS Inquiry
     screen (MS036P screen, option 9) (Attachment 5).
     4.3. Turn-in of exchangeable components from end item disassembly/reclamation, shop
     floor clean-up, or components acquired during condemnation of the end item will not be
     processed under DIFM/DOTM control. These components will be turned-in by the PSS
     (scheduling function) in the Exchangeable Production System (G402A). The PST (material
     function) will process all non-exchangeable turn-ins as a found-on-base (FOB) in NIMMS on
     the MN045P screen.
        4.3.1. Enter ‘N’ in the CREDIT EXPCTD field, leave the JOB ORDER NUMBER
        blank, and enter an ‘X’ in the MEDIA & STATUS field and COST CODE ‘M’ into the
        NIMMS MN045P screen (Attachment 6). See training package on SharePoint under the
        turn in folder.
        4.3.2. For all DIFM/DOTM problems or errors that need to be corrected in D035K,
        contact the DLA Material Support Specialist (MSS) assigned to the production shop.
5. Depot Level Reparable (DLR) With Missing Components. When depot maintenance
receives a DLR for repair with a shop repair unit missing, the following options may be used
based on the impact to the shop’s delivery schedule: Obtain approval from the material manager
(MM)/item manager (IM) to order the missing component using a cost code ‘M’ request; or
obtain the squadron director’s approval to use the cost code ‘S’ to order the missing item. Use of
cost codes ‘M’ or ‘S’ will not create a DIFM/DOTM detail. By obtaining permission from the
prime MM/IM to order the missing component with a cost code ‘M’, the MM/IM is provided the
visibility to see that field units may be stock piling parts, which could result in an overall
shortage for the AF. It is the responsibility of the MM/IM to remedy the recurring situations.
NOTE: Before initiating the cost code ‘M’ request, check with the shop to see if the item was
removed during a reclaim or harvest process and turned in as FOB. If it was a FOB turn-in,
contact the MSS for a reversal transaction to set up a DIFM credit prior to ordering the item.
     5.1. The PST/PSS will obtain written authorization from the MM/IM to use the cost code
     ‘M’. An example of use of the cost code ‘M’ letter is located in the Material Support
     SharePoint in the DIFM/DOTM sub-folder (Attachment 7, Figures A7.1 and A7.2). The
309MXWI23-101 17 May 2012                                                                      5


   PST/PSS must submit a supply discrepancy report (SDR) prior to requesting the cost code
   ‘M’ authorization. NOTE: If the shipping activity cannot be determined, submit the SDR
   and state that the origin of the shipment cannot be determined.
      5.1.1. The SDR must be submitted through the WEB SDR system located at
      https://www.daas.dla.mil/daashome/homepage.asp.         Click on ‘Continue to this
      website’ to get to the WEB SDR page. Additional training for the WEB SDR is located
      on SharePoint in the Material Support folder (Attachment 7, Figures A7.1 and A7.3).
   5.2. When the cost code ‘M’ authorization is received, the PST/PSS will process the request
   in ABOM Exchangeable Module with a cost code ‘M’.
      5.2.1. All cost code ‘M’ authorizations and approvals will be maintained for 6 months.
      5.2.2. If the MM/IM does not approve the free issue, the PST/PSS will obtain written
      approval from the squadron director to order the material using cost code ’S’.
      5.2.3. Use the sample of the cost code ‘M’ request letter located in the DIFM/DOTM
      sub-folder, change the cost code from ‘M’ to ‘S’, and send to the squadron director.
      After approval is received, process the issue request in ABOM with the cost code ‘S’.
      5.2.4. If the squadron director does not approve the cost code ‘S’ for the order, the PSS
      (scheduler) will request a condition code from the MM/IM to turn the end item into
      supply.
      5.2.5. The PST/PSS will ensure that the condition tag attached to the end item has the
      stock number and part number of the missing items listed on the back of the condition
      tag.
6. Follow-Up Actions Required After Processing an Exchangeable Turn-In.
   6.1. The PST/PSS will:
      6.1.1. Ensure the item is placed in the agreed upon hand-off point for material returns to
      supply.
      6.1.2. Document the hand-off with the following: national stock number (NSN),
      document number, serial number, name of the person the item was handed off to and the
      date of the hand-off.
      6.1.3. 10 days after handing the item off to the MSS, review the transaction history
      screen in D035K to see if the receipt has been processed.
      6.1.4. If the receipt has not been processed after 10 days, contact the MSS and provide
      the document number, NSN and the date the item was handed off. The MSS can do the
      necessary research to determine why the turn-in was not processed in a timely manner.
      Make a note of the date of the follow-up with the MSS.
          6.1.4.1. If the receipt has not processed after 21 days, elevate it to the scheduling
          supervisor for assistance.
   6.2. Additional information can be found on the Material Support Maintenance Wing
   SharePoint in the DIFM/DOTM folder.
7. Additional DIFM/DOTM Responsibilities for SCP at Kadena.
6                                                             309MXWI23-101 17 May 2012


    7.1. This section prescribes procedures unique to the SCP production support section when
    ordering or turning-in DIFM/DOTM assets. The SCP is an off-site operating location
    supporting the Pacific bases, and is part of the 309th Electronics Maintenance Group.
    ABOM and D035K will be used to process all DIFM/DOTM transactions. Physical
    movement of the unserviceable DIFM assets from the SCP is handled by the local 309th
    Electronics Maintenance Squadron (309 EMXS) personnel.
    7.2. The SCP PST will order and turn in exchangeable material IAW the process in
    paragraphs 4.1.1. through 4.3.1. of this instruction.
    7.3. The SCP PST and the retail item manager (RIM) will work together to resolve any
    material discrepancies associated with DIFM/DOTM items shipped to or from the SCP. The
    RIM will contact the local point of contact (POC) in the 309 EMXS whenever the
    discrepancies cannot be locally resolved.
    7.4. The SCP PST will process the unserviceable turn-in transaction through ABOM. The
    system will generate the turn-in documentation; this documentation will be packed with the
    material when it is shipped to the 309 EMXS POC.
    7.5. The SCP PST will prepare the off-line shipping document and take the material to the
    local shipping and planning section in the transportation unit for shipment to the 309 EMXS
    POC.
    7.6. The SCP PST will notify the local 309 EMXS POC of the shipment by email and
    provide the shipment number. Maintain a copy of the shipment and turn in paperwork for
    research purposes. If the transaction has not processed in 30 days, engage the RIM and the
    309 EMXS POC for assistance.
    7.7. Monthly Validation: The RIM will monitor the monthly DIFM/DOTM review listing
    (A-D035K-BE7-M08-L87) to ensure that DIFM details are cleared within 60 days, and that
    the shop does not accumulate over age credits (i.e., credit details over 18 months are
    considered over age).
       7.7.1. If the credits are over 18 months old, the RIM will perform a manual deletion
       (ZFX/M) in D035K, and validation with production is not required; the RIM will ensure
       enough DIFM credits are maintained to be matched with the backorders tied to awaiting
       parts end items.
