1. Requesting and Terminating Cellular Telephone or Blackberry Services.
   1.1. Requesting Blackberry or cellular telephone service. All requests must be submitted
   with complete justification and appropriate documentation in advance of purchase.
   1.2. Requests are made by completing an entry into the communications tracking system by
   the unit’s Telephone Control Officer (TCO).
 2                                                    AVIANOABI33-106 2 OCTOBER 2012


        1.2.1. Requests must document the communications requirement, not the specific need
        for an equipment item.
        1.2.2. The request must provide sufficient justification as to why a mobile
        communications asset is needed and have the requesting unit Commander’s validation
        and the unit RA’s approval.
     1.3. Blackberry and cellular telephone requests exceeding the allowance as outlined in
     paragraphs 4.1 and 5.1 must be approved by the Communication Systems Officer. All
     approved requests will be kept on file by the unit TCO.
     1.4. Terminating Blackberry or cellular telephone Service. When a Blackberry or cellular
     telephone device is no longer needed a request must be submitted to 31 CS to terminate
     service. The device must then be turned in to the unit ITEC. The ITEC is responsible for
     reutilizing the device or properly disposing of it using the Defense Logistics Agency
     Disposition Services (formerly DRMO).
2. Telephone, Blackberry Device and Cellular & Landline Telephone Billing.
     2.1. A bi-monthly validation of Blackberry service, cellular, and landline telephone bills
     must be performed prior to payment of the bill. The bi-monthly validation process is
     initiated by the 31 CS/SCXB Billing Office by sending a receipt of charges to each unit’s
     TCO.
     2.2. TCOs will validate the accuracy of their bill via a digitally signed email with 31
     CS/SCXB. The emailed response will state “I certify that calls for the month of _______ are
     official and payment is due.” TCO will respond within 10 days of the certification request
     from 31 CS/SCXB.
     2.3. Blackberry service, cellular and landline telephone bills are paid by the
     Communications Squadron from pre-allocated funds. Organizations will pre-plan their
     budget at the start of the fiscal year.
        2.3.1. Organizations that go over their annual budget will reimburse the Communications
        Squadron for the amount overspent. Group Resource Advisors will coordinate this
        reimbursement with 31 CPTS and the 31 CS Resource Advisor.
3. Billing for Unauthorized Calls.
     3.1. Commanders may seek reimbursement for all unauthorized calls made on government
     telephones IAW AFI 33-106 Para 4.9.3.1.
     3.2. The unit TCO will review all telephone data and will inform 31 CS/SCXB if
     unauthorized calls occur. In this case, 31 CS/SCXB will prepare a DD Form 1131, Cash
     Collection Voucher, and provide it to the unit TCO who in turn will provide it to the user.
     The user will then remit payment to 31 CPTS and provide the corresponding voucher number
     as proof of payment to his TCO. The unit TCO will provide this documentation to 31
     CS/SCXB, at which point the issue will be considered closed.
     3.3. In the case where abuse is suspected, the TCO will inform the unit Commander of the
     situation. Leadership involvement will be needed should this situation occur.

4. Blackberry Device Authorization and Use Policy.
   4.1. Authorization of Blackberry devices. The use of Blackberry devices is restricted to
   Wing Commander, Vice Commander, Wing Staff Agency Chiefs, Group Commanders,
   Squadron Commanders and two additional personnel per squadron. These two additional
   personnel to include mission critical on-call personnel will be validated by their commander
   and submitted through the TCO via the communication requirements tracking system.
   Features and services beyond calls and e-mail may be disabled due to network security
   policy. All features must have Designated Approving Authority. Blackberry devices will
   not be used for command and control. Commanders are responsible for ensuring oversight of
   assets.
   4.2. Additional Blackberry authorizations. If additional Blackberry devices are required
   beyond those identified above, approval from the Communications System Officer (CSO) is
   required. A request via the communications requirement tracking system is required to
   document this approval. The unit requesting this additional authorization will be responsible
   for funding the Blackberry device purchase, the server license needed to support the device
   and all monthly charges incurred for the device.
      4.2.1. Existing devices will be grandfathered into this restriction and are not subject to
      CSO approval.
   4.3. Authorized Blackberry device model. Before purchasing Blackberry devices, contact
   31 CS/SCOS for the most current authorized Blackberry device model. Only models
   approved by 31 CS/SCOS may be purchased. Models may be grey, dark blue, black or silver
   in color.
   4.4. Use Policy. All use policies that apply to cellular telephones apply to Blackberry
   devices as well. See paragraph 4 of this document for Cellular Telephone (CT) use policy.
5. Cellular Telephone Authorization and Use Policy.
   5.1. Authorization of new cellular telephone devices. The use of cellular telephones is
   restricted to Group and Squadron Superintendents, Flight Chiefs, Flight Commanders and
   mission critical on-call personnel. Mission critical on-call personnel will be validated by the
   unit Commander. Any additional personnel requiring a cellular telephone will be validated
   by the unit Commander and approved by the CSO.
   5.2. Air Force provided cellular telephones are to be used for official administrative
   purposes. Cellular telephones will not be used for command and control. Personnel are
   authorized to use cellular telephones to make short infrequent personal calls when
   appropriate under the circumstances. An example of an appropriate call includes notifying a
   family member of a change in work schedule. Emergency calls are always authorized.
   Examples of inappropriate calls include personal calls that generate more than minimal
   charges to the government, obscene or harassing calls, or calls for commercial gain.
   Reference AFI 33-106 for additional details regarding authorized cellular telephone usage.
   5.3. If you are calling another Defense Switched Network (DSN) number, use a regular
   landline telephone as a first priority. For cell phone calls, if you have a government cell
   phone, call from a government cell phone to a cell phone. Following these guidelines saves
   the government money by using lower calling rates.

     5.4. Telephone Monitoring and Recording.               The Air Force uses unsecured
     telecommunications systems such as telephones, Blackberry devices, cellular telephones,
     radios, facsimile, pagers, computer networks and other wired or wireless electronic devices
     to conduct day-to-day official business. Adversaries can easily monitor unsecured systems
     that could provide information on military capabilities, limitations, intentions and activities.
     User awareness is an important aspect of mitigating this threat. See AFI 33-219,
     Telecommunications Monitoring and Assessment Program (TMAP), for more information.
     5.5. When a cellular telephone is issued, personnel are required to sign a form that includes
     the following notice and consent statement: “Do not transmit classified information over
     unsecured telecommunications systems. Official DoD telecommunications systems are
     subject to monitoring. Using this telecommunications system or device constitutes consent
     to monitoring.” The signed form will be retained by the owning unit’s TCO for 6 months
     after the device is returned. Every cellular telephone will have a DD Form 2056, Telephone
     Monitoring Notification Decal (miniature version) attached. These forms can be obtained
     from the Asset Management Office (31 CS/SCOS).
6. Cellular Telephones for Temporary Loan and Contingency Use.
     6.1. Temporary Loan. The 31st Communications Squadron will have a limited number of
     cellular telephone s and Blackberry devices on hand for temporary loan.
     6.2. Terms of use.
        6.2.1. Temporary cellular telephones are requested by submitting a request in the
        communications requirements tracking system by the unit TCO. Cellular telephones for
        loan are available on a first come, first served basis. The 31st Communications Squadron
        does not guarantee availability of a cellular telephone for loan.
        6.2.2. Unit commander approval is required for use of a cellular telephone while TDY.
        6.2.3. If a loaned Blackberry device or cellular telephone is not returned by the due date,
        service will be terminated and all charges incurred for service deactivation/reactivation
        will be billed to the borrowing unit. A Report of Survey will be completed by the
        borrowing unit if the device is not returned to 31 CS within 30 days of the due date.
        6.2.4. The 31st Communications Squadron reserves the right to recall any loaned cellular
        telephone if required by a higher priority mission.
        6.2.5. When a unit Blackberry or cellular telephone is returned to the company for
        maintenance, a temporary device will be issued if available.
     6.3. Contingency Use. Contingency operations are a military operation as designated by the
     Secretary of Defense. Examples include Operation DESERT STORM, DENY FLIGHT, and
     ENDURING FREEDOM. All charges accrued during temporary use of a cellular telephone
     will be billed to the accounting code for contingency operations.
7. TCOs
     7.1. TCOs validate communication requirements and cellular and DSN call charges for their
     unit. They are the liaison between their unit and the 31 CS and are responsible for all of their
     squadron’s communication requests.         The TCO will submit requests through the
AVIANOABI33-106 2 OCTOBER 2012                                                                5


   communications requirements tracking system, currently the Work Order Management
   System.
   7.2. Each Squadron Commander, Wing Staff Agency, Tenant Organization & GSU will
   assign a primary and alternate TCO for their unit (Reference: AFMAN 33-145). A sample
   appointment letter is available in Attachment 4 of this instruction. Signed TCO appointment
   letters are to be forwarded to 31 CS/SCXC (SCXC@aviano.af.mil).
   7.3. TCOs will annually revalidate their unit’s Blackberry and cellular telephone inventory.
   The Asset Management Office (31 CS/SCOS) will send a validation listing to each unit TCO.
   This listing will be utilized to account for and ensure all Blackberry devices and cellular
   telephone s have the DD Form 2056 attached, per paragraph 4 of this document. The Unit
   TCO will send the completed, signed revalidation spreadsheet back to 31 CS/SCOS for
   compilation of the base’s complete wireless communication inventory. 31 CS/SCOS will
   maintain this validation.
8. IT Equipment Custodians (ITECs)
   8.1. Unit Commanders appoint Primary and Alternate ITECs to identify PWCS

   Asset Management Office (31 CS/SCOS). A blank inventory sheet will be provided to the
   ITEC by 31 CS/SCOS. When 100% inventory is complete and returned to 31 CS/SCOS, 31
   CS/SCOS will send an official inventory sheet for the ITEC and Squadron Commander to
   sign. The inventory will be closed upon final receipt of the official inventory by 31
   CS/SCOS.
   8.3. All ITECs are responsible for disposing of their unit’s outdated or unneeded IT
   equipment. ITECs will coordinate this disposal with the Defense Logistics Agency
   Disposition Services (formerly DRMO).
   8.4. All ITECs have additional responsibilities as outlined in AFI 33-112, paragraphs 8.5 and

              CUSTOMER BRIEFING AND ACCOUNTABILITY RECEIPT

1. This briefing is intended to inform those using a government Blackberry device and cellular
telephone (CT) of the user responsibilities.

2. Blackberry Service and CT Costs: The using organization is billed for each individual
Blackberry device and CT number. Personal calls should be kept to an absolute minimum, and
should not overrun plan minutes even if you are willing to reimburse the government. If you are
calling another DSN number, use a regular (corded landline) telephone as a first priority. For
cell phone calls, if you have a government cell phone, call from a government cell phone to a cell
phone, the rates are less expensive than a regular telephone. Bills are reviewed carefully for
unauthorized or questionable charges. You will be asked to validate to your unit TCO that all
Blackberry device and/or CT charges to your number were for authorized purposes.

3. Security. Blackberry devices and CTs are not to be used for operational communications, i.e.,
those which may be considered sensitive or For Official Use Only. IAW AFMAN 33-145, Do
not use regular unclassified Blackberry devices or CT for C2 purposes. The weak CT signal is
susceptible to jamming, intrusion, interference
and monitoring. All Blackberries must be password protected.

4. Fraud, Waste and Abuse. Using a government Blackberry device or CT without approval for
other than official government business and authorized calls without reimbursement to the
government is fraud. Using a Blackberry device or a CT in lieu of other available government
landlines, where available, is abuse. Using a Blackberry devices or CT when pagers and radios
will accomplish the mission is waste.

5. Statements of Understanding. By signing below, I certify that I will not discuss classified or
sensitive information on this device. I acknowledge and understand the following statement
IAW AFI 33-219. “Do not transmit classified information over unsecured telecommunications
systems. Official DOD telecommunications systems are subject to monitoring. Using this
telecommunications system or device constitutes consent to monitoring.”


I acknowledge receipt of and responsibility for the items described herein. I certify that all
charges incurred on this cellular phone while it is signed out to me will be for government
official and authorized calls, unless otherwise noted.
