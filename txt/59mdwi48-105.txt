        technicians who perform invasive procedures with sharp instruments in a poorly
        visualized or highly confined anatomic site, as defined by the most current CDC
        guidelines.
        1.3.3.2. High risk personnel: personnel who have direct contact with patients or
        blood/body fluids, and are at ongoing risk for injuries with sharp
        instruments/needlesticks.
     1.3.4. Ensures currency for hepatitis B vaccine: All military, civilians, students,
     volunteers and other temporary staff whose duties involve direct patient contact must

     1 September 2002 will be tested for serological evidence of immunity.
        1.3.4.1. Those who completed the 3-dose series prior to 1 September 2002 do not
        require evidence of immunity and will only be tested in the event of a potential
        hepatitis B virus (HBV) exposure.
        1.3.4.2. New employees, classified as “high risk”, who have no documentation of
        immunity against HBV or a record of completion of the hepatitis B vaccination series
        will start the series after completion of BBP training and within 10 working days.
        Antibody titers will be drawn 1 to 2 months after completion of the 3-dose series.

           1.3.4.3. Personnel who do not develop antibodies after the initial vaccine series will
           complete a second 3-dose series.
           1.3.4.4. Revaccinated personnel will be tested for antibodies 1 to 2 months after the
           last dose of vaccine. Personnel negative after a second vaccine series are considered
           non-responders to hepatitis B vaccination (likely still susceptible to HBV infection)
           and should be documented as “susceptible” in the ASIMS database.
           1.3.4.5. “Exposure prone” personnel who do not have serological evidence of
           immunity against HBV will be tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and
           hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAG) regardless of when the vaccine series was
           completed.
           1.3.4.6. Personnel who have HIV, Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), or HBV will be referred

Active Tuberculosis—The progressive and contagious form of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as
indicated by abnormal chest x-ray, acid-fast bacilli and positive culture. Pulmonary TB should
be suspected in persons who have a productive cough, prolonged cough (duration of 2- 3 weeks)
59MDWI48-105 1 JULY 2014                                                                            17


chest pain, hemoptysis, and the systemic symptoms of TB including fever, chills, night sweats,
appetite loss, weight loss, and easy fatigability. See the definition for latent tuberculosis below.
Blood—Means human blood, human blood components, and products made from human blood.
Bloodborne Pathogens—Pathogenic microorganisms that are present in human blood and can
cause disease in humans. These pathogenic organisms include, but are not limited to, hepatitis B
virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure—An exposure that might place the exposed patient at risk for
HIV infection is defined as a percutaneous injury (e.g., a needlestick or cut with a sharp object)
or contact of mucous membrane or nonintact skin (e.g., exposed skin that is chapped, abraded, or
afflicted with dermatitis) with blood, tissue, or other body fluids that are potentially infectious. In
addition to blood and visibly bloody body fluids, semen and vaginal secretions also are
considered potentially infectious.
Exposure—Prone HCW (Indicative of risk is to the patient)—Medical and dental providers,
nurses, and technicians who perform invasive procedures with sharp instruments in a poorly
visualized or highly confined anatomic site. The CDC defines invasive procedures as “surgical
