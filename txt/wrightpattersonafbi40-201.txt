   investigations and any other documentation such as the annual ALARA report that concerns
   radiation safety.

Section B—PERMITS FOR THE POSSESSION AND USE OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL
AND RADIATION-PRODUCING DEVICES

9. AF License. The AF has been issued a master materials license by the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC). This license authorizes the AF Radioisotope Committee (RIC)
to grant AF radioactive material permits to Air Force organizations for possession and use of
byproduct, source and special nuclear materials, normally controlled by the NRC.
10. AF Permits. WPAFB tenant organizations have been issued AF radioactive material
permits by the RIC authorizing the possession and use of radioactive material of diverse types,
forms and quantities.
11. WPAFB Permits. The WPAFB RSC has reserved the authority to control the possession
and use of radiation-producing devices such as x-ray machines and accelerators that are not
under the jurisdiction of either the NRC or the RIC.
12. Other Organizations. Organizations located at WPAFB and contractors performing work
at WPAFB must possess a NRC or Agreement State License, an AF or Navy radioactive material
permit, or WPAFB radioactive material/radiation-producing device authorization in order to
possess and/or use radioactive material or radiation-producing devices.
   12.1. Radioactive material includes any item that emits radiation without external power.
   Examples are byproduct, source and special nuclear material as defined in the Code of
   Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 10, Parts 30, 40 and 70. Products distributed as exempt by
   a manufacturer licensed to distribute to exempt persons do not require a permit, if used for
   their intended purpose. Any unusual activities involving these sources, such as attempting to
   remove the radioactive material from the item or accumulating large quantities of these items
   for storage may require a permit. Although there are no administrative controls over these
   items, they may require controlled disposal. If there is any doubt as to the requirement for a
   permit or the proper method of disposal, contact the WPAFB RSO for guidance.
   12.2. A radiation-producing device is any piece of equipment that emits ionizing radiation,
   regardless of intent, when energized by an external power source. Examples include medical
   and industrial x-ray machines, x-ray diffraction and fluorescence units, scanning and
   transmission electron microscopes and particle accelerators. In general, any device that
   accelerates electrons or other atomic particles with a potential difference of 10,000 volts or
   greater and produces x-radiation, either intentionally or unintentionally, may require a
   WPAFB radiation-producing device permit. Some exceptions are television monitors,
   cathode ray tubes and video display terminals which are manufactured under the strict
   requirements of 21 CFR 1020.10. If there is any doubt as to the requirement for a permit,
   contact the WPAFB RSO for guidance.
13. Permit Requests. Requests for AF radioactive material permits or WPAFB radioactive
material/radiation-producing device authorization shall be submitted in writing to the WPAFB
RSO. Applications for either new permits, renewals of old permits, or amendments to existing
permits or authorizations shall be reviewed by the WPAFB RSO who may either (a) reject the
application, (b) return it for additional clarification, (c) refer it to the RIC or WPAFB RSC for
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI40-201 25 JULY 2012                                                           11


review, or (d) issue a permit or authorization. Once approved, organizations are required to
comply with the statements made in their application as well as any additional conditions
imposed by the WPAFB RSO and the WPAFB RSC and listed as a condition of the permit or
authorization itself. Any changes in the activities or personnel specified in the permit shall be
accompanied by the submission of an application for amendment of the permit. Applications for
amendments shall be submitted in the same manner as the original or renewal application except
that only those items being changed need be addressed.
14. Permit Authorization. A WPAFB radioactive material/radiation-producing device permit
authorizes the possession and use of radioactive material or radiation-producing devices. All
operations conducted under the conditions of the permit must be documented to ensure
compliance with the WPAFB ALARA program.
15. Contractors:
   15.1. Contractors performing services involving the use of radioactive material under the
   auspices of their own NRC or Agreement State License shall provide a copy of that license to
   the WPAFB RSO well in advance of operations being conducted at WPAFB. For contractors
   licensed by an Agreement State, in addition to a copy of the license, a completed copy of
   NRC Form 241, Report of Proposed Activities in Non-Agreement States, Areas of Exclusive
   Federal Jurisdiction, or Offshore Waters, shall be submitted to the WPAFB RSO. The
   WPAFB RSO will review the license to ensure that the material and activities are authorized.
   The contractor shall be required to comply with all applicable sections of this instruction as it
   applies to safe use of radioactive material and the reporting of incidents or accidents to the
   WPAFB RSO. The WPAFB RSO shall be notified when the operation is terminated.
   15.2. Contractors performing services involving the use of radioactive material under the
   auspices of an AF radioactive material permit issued to WPAFB shall comply with all
   requirements specified in this instruction.
   15.3. Contractors who will be using radiation-producing devices shall obtain a WPAFB
   radiation-producing device permit from the WPAFB RSO as would any WPAFB
   organization. Coordinate such activities with the WPAFB RSO prior to bringing radiation-
   producing devices’ onto the installation.
   15.4. For both radioactive material and radiation-producing device activities contractors
   shall provide a brief description of the work to be performed. Include the dates and locations
   where such activities shall be performed. While working on the installation, the WPAFB
   RSO can make on-site inspections to ensure the contractor follows proper radiation safety
   practices and can suspend any operations deemed to be unsafe or in violation of AF or NRC
   regulations.

Section C—DESIGNATION OF AREAS

16. The following definitions are extracted from the 10 CFR Part 20:
   16.1. ―Restricted area‖ means any area, access to which is limited for the purpose of
   protecting of individuals against undue risks from exposure to radiation and radioactive
   material.
 12                                       WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI40-201 25 JULY 2012


   16.2. ―Radiation area‖ means an area, accessible to individuals, in which radiation levels
   could result in an individual receiving a dose equivalent in excess of 0.005 rem in 1 hour at
   30 centimeters from the radiation source or from any surface that the radiation penetrates.
   16.3. ―High radiation area‖ means an area, accessible to individuals, in which radiation
   levels could result in an individual receiving a dose equivalent in excess of 0.1 rem in 1 hour
   at 30 centimeters from the radiation source or from any surface that the radiation penetrates.
17. Rem in One Hour. The limits in the above definitions are specified in terms of "rem in one
hour" not "rem per hour (rem/hr).‖ The difference between these two expressions is significant.
If the limit was expressed as 0.005 rem/hr, then any measurement with a survey meter above
0.005 rem/hr would classify the location as a radiation area. However, when expressed as 0.005
rem in 1 hour, a measurement of 0.01 rem/hr could still be classified as a non-radiation area if
the occupancy were limited to no more than 30 minutes each hour or if the radiation field were
present for no more than 30 minutes each hour. Such might be the case for an x-ray operation.
Therefore, the classification of a radiation area must also consider the occupancy of the area and
the duration of the radiation exposure.

Section D—Radiation Exposure Limits

18. Personnel Exposure. Personnel who work with radioactive material or radiation-producing
devices may be exposed to radiation during the course of their employment. The goal of the
radiation safety program at WPAFB is to maintain all radiation exposures ALARA. However, it
may be impossible to completely eliminate all radiation exposure. As a result, it is important to
understand the procedures used to monitor for radiation exposure and also the significance of a
radiation dose obtained during routine work activities.
19. Dose Limits. Federal regulations (10 CFR Part 20) specify the maximum permissible dose
limits for radiation workers, workers under 18 years of age, non-radiation workers (i.e., members
of the general public) and embryo/fetus.

Table 1. Radiation Workers
  In Any Calendar Year           Radiation Workers           Workers Under 18
  Whole body (TEDE)*             5 rem                       0.5 rem
  Lens of eye                    15 rem                      1.5 rem
  Skin or extremities            50 rem                      5 rem
NOTE: * The whole body means, for purposes of external exposure, head, trunk (including male
gonads), arms above the elbow, or legs above the knee. TEDE means total effective dose
equivalent.

Table 2. Members of the Public

WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI40-201 25 JULY 2012                                                           13


   19.1. The dose in any unrestricted area resulting from AF controlled radiation sources shall
   not exceed the limits specified above. The installation RSO shall be responsible for the
   assessment, either by measurement or calculation, that these dose limits are not exceeded and
   shall maintain such records for a period of three years. If integrated radiation levels could
   exceed these limits, the area must be restricted.

Table 3. Embryo/Fetus
  Entire pregnancy           500 millirem
  Monthly                    50 millirem

20. Occupational Exposure of Fertile Females:
   20.1. Each female potentially occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation shall be informed
   by the WPAFB RSO or a member of the staff of the risks to the unborn.
   20.2. A female military member shall, on becoming aware she is pregnant, notify her
   workplace supervisor or primary care manager. A non-military member should notify her
   workplace supervisor or primary care manager. A civilian woman’s decision to declare her
   pregnancy is entirely voluntary. Declaration of pregnancy shall be in writing and include the
   estimated date of conception, for the radiation exposure limits of the embryo/fetus to be
   applied.
   20.3. The WPAFB RSO may limit specific duties of a declared pregnant female who is
   occupationally exposed to radiation and who in the opinion of the WPAFB RSO may receive
   a whole body exposure greater than 500 millirem per year, either in the course of routine
   duties or as a result of a credible accident involving the radioactive material or radiation-
   producing devices. The WPAFB RSO’s evaluation shall include consideration of the
   workplace and the source of radiation, the individual's past history of exposure to radiation as
   documented by personnel dosimetry records, current radiation measurements applicable to
   her specific tasks, current exposure histories of coworkers, and likely exposures which would
   be incurred in the event of a credible accident.
   20.4. If the RSO determines it is unlikely that the declared pregnant female would receive a
   total exposure during the term of the pregnancy (including the period preceding the
   confirmation of the pregnancy) in excess of 500 millirem, she may continue in her radiation-
   related duties. However, if the individual is not already on the AF personnel dosimetry
   program, she shall be enrolled for the duration of her pregnancy. Arrangements shall be
   made with USAFSAM/Radiation Dosimetry (OEHH) to receive, in addition to the
   laboratory's routine written report, telephone notification of the individual's dosimetry results
   as soon as each dosimeter is processed by the laboratory. Should exposure results indicate a
   trend which, if continued, could result in exceeding the 500 millirem limit, a re-evaluation
   shall be made as to whether she should continue her radiation duties, be restricted from
   certain high risk duties, or be removed entirely from occupational exposure.
   20.5. Special consideration must be made when a declared pregnant worker's radiation duties
   involve the operation of high output sources or the use of unsealed radioactive material.
   Pregnant workers shall not continue in duties involving these sources without the
   concurrence of AFMSA/SG3PB. When a pregnancy is suspected and reported to the
 14                                      WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI40-201 25 JULY 2012


   immediate supervisor, women working with such sources or materials shall receive a prompt
   evaluation by the WPAFB RSO (within five workdays after receipt of the consult request)
   and, if warranted, actions such as restrictions or removal may be taken even prior to
   confirmation of the pregnancy.

Section E—DOSIMETRY

21. Radiation Workers. Individuals who routinely work with or in the vicinity of sources of
ionizing radiation may be designated as radiation workers by the WPAFB RSO after an
evaluation of the potential hazards. Radiation workers are issued radiation dosimeters which are
exchanged either monthly or quarterly as determined by the WPAFB RSO: In certain
circumstances, radiation workers may also be issued self reading pocket or digital dosimeters in
addition to standard radiation dosimeters to permit immediate evaluation of a potentially
hazardous radiation environment.
   21.1. AF radiation dosimeters shall only be issued to military or civilian government
   employees or contractors working with government owned and operated radiation sources.
   Contractors using contractor owned and operated radiation sources shall be required to
   provide dosimeters to their own personnel.
   21.2. The WPAFB RSO and his/her staff are responsible for:
       21.2.1. Determining whether radiation monitoring is required.
       21.2.2. Determining the frequency of radiation monitoring.
       21.2.3. Issuing and exchanging radiation dosimeters.
   21.3. The supervisor, or designated radiation dosimeter monitor, of a newly assigned worker
   has the responsibility to request radiation monitoring for that individual. Monitoring shall be
   required if the worker shall be located in an area designated by the WPAFB RSO as a
   potential radiation hazard area or if, because of the assigned duties, the individual is
   classified as a radiation worker requiring dosimetry.
   21.4. Each individual to be monitored shall be provided with a radiation safety briefing to
   include an explanation concerning proper wearing and storage of the dosimeter and the right
   to review the dosimetry results each month or quarter. The installation RSO shall ensure that
   each individual monitored is provided with the summary results of dosimetry (internal and
   external) annually on AF Form 1527-1.
   21.5. The supervisor shall reinforce this information by introducing the dosimeter monitor
   who shall indicate the dosimeter storage location and describe the procedures for requesting a
   review of the dosimetry results maintained by the supervisor.
   21.6. The supervisor shall not permit anyone to enter a radiation use area or work with
   radioactive material or radiation-producing devices unless that individual has been
   designated a radiation worker, been properly briefed, and been issued a dosimeter, if
   appropriate. Visitors to any restricted areas shall be accompanied by persons knowledgeable
   about the protection and safety measures in the area and must be provided adequate
   information and instruction before entering the area. Visitors entering a radiation area or a
   high radiation area or that could incur a deep dose equivalent of greater than 10 millirem
   shall be provided personnel monitoring devices. In those rare instances where it is essential
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI40-201 25 JULY 2012                                                         15


  for visitors to enter such restricted areas for brief periods and where they may receive greater
  than 10 millirem, the supervisor shall ensure that each visitor is provided with a self reading
  pocket dosimeter or other radiation monitoring device and that the following information is
  recorded and a copy provided to the WPAFB RSO:
     21.6.1. Name.
     21.6.2. Organization/Address.
     21.6.3. Telephone No.
     21.6.4. SSAN.
     21.6.5. Dosimeter Serial No.
  21.6.6. Initial and final dose readings (if direct reading).
     21.6.7. Date, time and duration of visit.
     21.6.8. If at all possible, prior coordination with the WPAFB RSO concerning visitor
     access to restricted radiation areas should be accomplished.
  21.7. Monthly or quarterly, as applicable, report of the exposures recorded on the dosimeters
  is published (AF Listing 1499). This report is provided to the WPAFB RSO who reviews the
  results to determine if the exposures recorded are in compliance with the ALARA program.
  After review of the report, the WPAFB RSO forwards a copy to the supervisors of the
  personnel monitored. These results shall be available to radiation workers for review.
  21.8. There are several types of dosimeters which may be issued and specific rules
  governing proper wear of dosimeters:
     21.8.1. Thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) badges are issued to monitor personnel for
     radiation exposure. There are three types of badges and depending on the type of
     radiation work performed, one, two or possibly all three will be issued to a single
     individual.
         21.8.1.1. The first type is called a whole body badge. As indicated by its name, it is
         designed to measure the radiation exposure to the entire body. Obviously, no badge
         which is approximately 1 by 2 inches can measure the radiation exposure to the whole
         body. However, the badge should be worn at the location of highest expected whole
         body radiation dose. The whole body badge is typically worn somewhere between
         the waist and the shoulders (i.e., waistband, collar or shirt pocket). In this location,
         the badge will provide a measure of the radiation exposure to the internal organs and
         the gonads. If as is generally the case, the individual normally faces the radiation
         source, the badge should be worn on the front. However, if in some unusual instance,
         the radiation source is routinely behind the individual, the badge may be worn on the
         back. Since this badge is designed to provide a measure of the radiation exposure to
         the whole body, it should always be worn so as to be exposed to the same radiation
         environment as the body.
         21.8.1.2. The second type of badge is called the collar badge and is normally worn on
         the shirt collar. It is designed to provide a representative sample of the radiation
         exposure to the critical organs above the shoulders, i.e., the thyroid in the neck and
         the lens of the eye. When a protective shield such as a lead apron is worn, the collar
16                                      WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI40-201 25 JULY 2012


         badge is placed outside the protective shield not under it. Results recorded on a collar
         badge are often reported as a "head" dose.
         21.8.1.3. The third type of badge is called an extremity badge or finger badge. It is
         worn like a ring on a finger of the hand which is most likely to be exposed to the
         radiation. If the source of radiation is typically held in the hand, the ring should be
         worn with the top portion turned around facing the palm and the radiation. However,
         if the radiation originates from a remote source such as an x-ray diffraction unit and
         the hand is likely to be exposed from the back, the ring should be worn in the usual
         manner.
  21.9. If dosimeters are issued and irrespective of how many other dosimeters are assigned, a
  whole body dosimeter is always worn by a radiation worker. Any other badges issued are
  worn in addition to the whole body badge--never in place of it. The reason is, simply stated,
  that the collar and finger badges measure radiation exposure only to specific organs of the
  body whereas the whole body badge measures the radiation exposure to the most critical
  organs.
  21.10. All radiation badges should be worn while working in a designated radiation use area.
  The badges should be put on before beginning work and removed after leaving the radiation
  use area. When not being worn, the badges must be stored on a rack or board of some kind
  in a radiation-free environment along with a control badge. This location is normally called a
  "control board.‖ The control badge always remains on the control board. Its purpose is to
  measure the background radiation level in the storage area and while the badges are in transit
  so that this radiation exposure can be subtracted from the measured values on the personnel
  badges since this exposure represents radiation not received by the badge while worn in the
  work environment. Badges must never be taken home or stored in any other location such as
  desk drawers or attached to lab coats. Badges should also never be worn when undergoing
  medical radiation procedures such as diagnostic x-ray or dental examinations, nuclear
  medicine evaluations or radiation therapy treatments. Badges will provide an accurate
  measure of the radiation to which an individual is exposed only if they are worn and stored
  properly. If a badge is lost or damaged an investigation will be performed by the WPAFB
  RSO to estimate the exposure actually received during that monitoring period. The
  individual to whom the badge was issued shall be required to sign a statement explaining the
  circumstances of the loss or damage.
  21.11. In addition to routinely issued radiation monitoring badges, some activities of a
  higher risk of a large exposure may also require the use of self reading pocket dosimeters or
  similar device. Unlike TLDs which record the exposure but must be sent to OEHH for
  processing resulting in a delay of several weeks before the results are obtained, pocket
  dosimeters are designed to be evaluated immediately. Although traditionally not as accurate
  as TLDs, self reading pocket dosimeters do provide an instant indication as to whether an
  exposure has occurred. For this reason, self reading pocket dosimeters are issued to visitors
  likely to receive greater than 10 millirem so that it can be determined if an exposure has
  occurred before the visitor is lost to follow-up.
  21.12. If anyone suspects that a dosimeter has been exposed either deliberately or
  unintentionally to radiation irrespective of whether it was being worn at the time or not, the
  supervisor and the WPAFB RSO shall be notified immediately. The dosimeter shall be
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI40-201 25 JULY 2012                                                           17


   collected and delivered to OEHH for processing. If there is some evidence (such as survey
   meter readings or self reading pocket dosimeter results) that an individual was, in fact,
   overexposed, the WPAFB RSO shall be notified immediately. In the event that the
   installation RSO is notified by OEHH that an overexposure may have occurred, the RSO
   shall immediately contact the Unit Commander and request the individual be removed from
   all duties involving potential radiation exposure until an investigation is completed. The
   RSO shall investigate suspected overexposures and provide a written report within seven
   days through the MAJCOM Bioenvironmental Engineer to OEHH and AFMSA/SG3PB.
   Similar procedures shall be followed if the RSO is notified by an individual, or suspects, that
   an overexposure may have occurred.
22. Investigative Levels. In addition to federally imposed dose limits, the NRC has also
recommended the adoption of investigation levels for radiation workers. These levels are not
legal limits. They are values arbitrarily set at 10 percent (or some similar value) of the federally
mandated limits to assist radiation safety program monitors to comply with the ALARA concept
by anticipating potential difficulties and initiating corrective actions. Therefore, investigations
shall be accomplished in a timely manner by the WPAFB RSO for doses received by individuals
in excess of the established ALARA levels. The investigation shall consider each such exposure
in comparison with those of others performing similar tasks.

Table 4. Investigative Levels
 Per Monitoring Period             Radiation Workers (millirem)
 Whole body (TEDE)*                               125
 Lens of eye                                      375
 Skin or extremities                             1250
 Investigative levels for Areas 3 and 3A
 Whole Body (TEDE)*                               300
 Lens of eye                                      375
 Skin or extremities                             1250
NOTE: * The whole body means, for purposes of external exposure, head, trunk (including male
gonads), arms above the elbow, and legs above the knee.

Section F—ALARA

23. ALARA. The ALARA concept was developed in response to scientific evidence which
suggests that no level of radiation exposure is entirely risk-free. It is a policy which states that
although there are acceptable, conservative levels of radiation exposure specified by federal
regulations which offer a low risk of adverse health effects compared to the other hazards of life
and occupation, it is prudent to make every effort to reduce exposures to the lowest levels
reasonably achievable, thereby lowering the health risk associated with that exposure. In fact,
individual and cumulative radiation exposures must be maintained as close to zero as possible
given the type of activities involved, the state of technology, the risk to the individuals exposed
 18                                       WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI40-201 25 JULY 2012


and the benefit to society from the activity being accomplished. The guidance contained in this
instruction provides the basis for conducting an effective ALARA program.
24. ALARA Commitment. The radiation safety program at this installation is managed by the
WPAFB RSO and reviewed by the WPAFB RSC for the Installation Commander. WPAFB is
committed to the concept of ALARA. The ALARA commitment is summarized below:
   24.1. Management (88 ABW/CC):
       24.1.1. The management of WPAFB is committed to the ALARA program for
       maintaining individual and collective radiation doses ALARA. According to this
       commitment, WPAFB has developed an administrative organization and written policies,
       procedures and instructions to promote the ALARA concept. The organization consists
       of the WPAFB RSC and the WPAFB RSO.
       24.1.2. The management of WPAFB shall review and sign the annual ALARA report
       prepared by the WPAFB RSO and approved by the WPAFB RSC.
       24.1.3. The management of WPAFB shall authorize modifications to operating and
       maintenance procedures and to equipment and facilities if they shall reduce exposures
       unless the cost is considered unjustified. If requested, verification shall be provided that
       improvements have been sought, that modifications have been considered and that they
       have been implemented when reasonable. If modifications have been recommended but
       not implemented, management shall be prepared to describe the reasons for not
       implementing them.
   24.2. WPAFB RSC:
       24.2.1. The WPAFB RSC shall delegate authority to the WPAFB RSO for enforcement
       of the ALARA program and shall support the WPAFB RSO when it is necessary to assert
       authority. If the WPAFB RSC overrules the WPAFB RSO, the facts and basis for such
       action shall be documented in the minutes of the WPAFB RSC meeting.
       24.2.2. The WPAFB RSC may require users to develop new procedures to implement
       the ALARA concept and shall review occupational radiation exposure records to ensure
       compliance with ALARA.
   24.3. WPAFB RSO:
       24.3.1. The WPAFB RSO shall thoroughly review the qualifications of each applicant
       for a WPAFB radioactive material/radiation-producing device permit to ensure that the
       applicant shall be able to take appropriate measures to maintain exposures ALARA.
       24.3.2. The WPAFB RSO shall perform annual reviews of the radiation safety program
       and present the findings to the WPAFB RSC.
       24.3.3. The WPAFB RSO shall perform a quarterly review of radiation exposure records
       and records of radiation surveys and present the results to the WPAFB RSC each quarter.
       24.3.4. The WPAFB RSO shall ensure users, workers, and ancillary personnel are
       provided briefings describing the ALARA program at least annually.
       24.3.5. The WPAFB RSO shall encourage users to submit suggestions for improving
       health physics practices and increasing the effectiveness of the ALARA program and
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI40-201 25 JULY 2012                                                        19


       shall evaluate them with the goal of implementing as many of them as are considered
       acceptable and reasonable.
       24.3.6. The WPAFB RSO shall investigate all deviations from ALARA and direct
       changes when appropriate.
   24.4. Users:
       24.4.1. Users shall provide the WPAFB RSO with information concerning newly
       proposed uses of radioactive material or radiation-producing devices with sufficient lead
       time to permit the RSO to adequately evaluate the proposal. Alternate approaches shall
       be considered in the interest of ALARA.
       24.4.2. Users shall explain the ALARA concept to individuals supervised by them,
       ensure that they understand the concept and are adequately trained for the task required
       and document the training.
   24.5. Radiation Workers:
       24.5.1. Workers shall be instructed annually in the ALARA concept and its applicability
       to work practices and conditions
       24.5.2. Workers shall be advised of available recourses if they feel that the ALARA
       concept is not being implemented.

Section H—ORDERING AND RECEIVING RADIATION SOURCES

30. Ordering Radioactive Material. No one may order or receive radioactive material or
radiation-producing devices without first obtaining an AF radioactive material or WPAFB
radioactive material/radiation producing device permit for possession and use of the material or
device.
31. Authorization. Individuals or organizations who are issued a valid AF, Navy or a WPAFB
radioactive material/radiation-producing device permit may order radioactive material or
radiation-producing devices authorized by their permit. When placing orders, the following
actions shall be accomplished:
   31.1. The order must be forwarded to the WPAFB RSO through the permit RSO prior to
   submission to procurement.
   31.2. If an order is to be verbal (i.e., placed by phone or directly to a visiting supplier) the
   WPAFB RSO shall be notified immediately by phone of the intent to order and this shall be
   followed within five workdays by a written notification to the WPAFB RSO.
   31.3. The WPAFB RSO shall review the order to ensure it does not exceed the appropriate
   AF radioactive material or WPAFB radioactive material/radiation-producing device permit
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI40-201 25 JULY 2012                                                       21


   authorization, shall file a copy of the request with the permit, and forward the original to
   procurement or provide verbal authorization for immediate action.
   31.4. The purchase order request shall specify that the WPAFB RSO shall be contacted at
   extension 72010 during normal duty hours on receipt of the item at any location on WPAFB.
   If the package contains radioactive material and appears to be damaged or leaking, the
   WPAFB RSO shall be notified immediately through the WPAFB Consolidated Command
   Post at extension 76314, irrespective of the day or time.
   31.5. On notification that the item has arrived at WPAFB, the WPAFB RSO shall either
   send a member of the staff to inspect and monitor the package or merely request notification
   when the package is delivered to the user. Only the WPAFB RSO or the user shall open the
   package. The action taken shall depend on the hazard associated with the particular item and
   the condition of the package.
   31.6. After the package is opened by the user and the contents examined, the WPAFB RSO
   shall be notified immediately if there is either a discrepancy between the items ordered and
   received or if the items appear damaged. If all items are as ordered and in acceptable
   condition, notification shall be in writing to permit updating of the master WPAFB inventory
   (copies of shipping documents should be included).
32. Special precautions shall be taken by the permittee when receiving and opening
packages containing radioactive material:
   32.1. Visually inspect the package and, if damaged, notify the WPAFB RSO immediately.
   32.2. Measure the exposure rate at the package surface and, if greater than expected, contact
   the WPAFB RSO.
   32.3. Wear gloves when opening a package containing liquids.
   32.4. Verify the contents with the packing slip.
   32.5. Examine the integrity of the final source container.
   32.6. If anything unusual is encountered contact the WPAFB RSO.
   32.7. As specified in 10 CFR 20.1906, packages containing in excess of certain specified
   quantities of radioactive material must be monitored for external radiation and contamination
   within 3 hours after receipt during working hours and within 3 hours from the beginning of
   the next working day if it is received after working hours.

Section I—RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL WORK PROCEDURES

33. Although each work environment shall necessitate individual work practices, the
following procedures shall be incorporated in all radioactive material work procedures:
   33.1. Wear laboratory coats or other protective clothing at all times where unsealed
   radioactive material is used.
   33.2. Wear disposable gloves at all times while handling unsealed radioactive material.
   33.3. Before leaving restricted areas and where unsealed radioactive material is used,
   monitor hands and clothing for contamination with an appropriately sensitive survey meter.
 22                                      WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI40-201 25 JULY 2012


   33.4. Areas where unsealed radioactive material are stored or used shall be coordinated with
   the installation and Permit RSOs. No eating, drinking or smoking shall be permitted in these
   areas. In addition, cosmetics shall not be applied in those areas and exposed portions of the
   body such as the face should not be touched
   33.5. Do not store food, drink, or personal effects in areas where radioactive material are
   stored or used.
   33.6. If issued, wear personnel monitoring devices at all times while in areas where
   radioactive material are used or stored.
   33.7. Dispose of radioactive waste only in designated, labeled and properly shielded
   containers.
   33.8. Do not pipette radioactive liquids by mouth.
   33.9. Wash hands before eating, drinking, smoking or leaving work area.
   33.10. Discard contaminated protective equipment such as rubber gloves and boots into
   segregated radioactive waste disposal containers.
   33.11. Individuals with open wounds shall not work with radioactive material without proper
   protection.
   33.12. Items shall not be placed in ordinary trash or flushed down non-approved drains
   unless they are first checked for radioactivity with an appropriately sensitive survey meter.
   33.13. In areas where unsealed radioactive material is used, monitor surfaces after each use.

Section J—LEAK TESTING OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL (RAM)

34. Sealed sources of radioactive material are leak tested at intervals specified in the AF
radioactive material permits. Current requirements are:
   34.1. Beta and gamma sources in excess of 100 microcuries - As specified in the applicable
   permit or SS&DR.
   34.2. Alpha sources, designed for the purposes of alpha emissions, in excess of 10
   microcuries – As specified in the applicable permit or SS&DR.
35. Analysis. Leak testing shall be accomplished by the permit RSO, WPAFB RSO or staff for
analysis by WPAFB RSO or other that is licensed/permitted to perform the analysis.
36. Results. Results shall be maintained by the WPAFB RSO and a copy forwarded to the user
along with an interpretation of the results and any actions required.
37. Leaking Source. If contamination is detected in excess of acceptable limits (usually 0.005
microcurie), the source shall be secured in an isolated area until arrangements can be made for
the WPAFB RSO and staff to supervise decontamination of the item or packaging for shipment
either to the supplier or an approved radioactive waste disposal site.

Section K—RADIOACTIVE WASTE

38. Responsibility. Organizations possessing a valid radioactive material permit may generate
radioactive waste during the course of their operations. Each organization shall assume full
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI40-201 25 JULY 2012                                                            23


responsibility for collection, packaging, storage and disposal of radioactive waste generated. If
accomplished properly, the potential for contamination of the environment or subjecting
personnel to unnecessary radiation risk shall be eliminated. Each organization shall provide a
secure, isolated area for temporary storage of its own waste, on-site, near the location where
generated. Each site shall be approved by the WPAFB RSO. When a container is filled and
ready for disposal, the WPAFB RSO shall be notified. The WPAFB RSO shall make
arrangements for pickup of the waste by a disposal contractor authorized by AF Radioactive
Waste Program Office or transferred to an authorized AF radioactive material permit. Contracts
for pickup and disposal of radioactive waste shall NOT be made by the generator.
39. Management of Radioactive Waste. To ensure safe handling of radioactive waste, the
following guidance is provided. Any proposed deviations from this guidance must be submitted
in writing to the WPAFB RSO and approval must be obtained prior to implementation of the
alternative procedures.
   39.1. Generation of Waste. The primary goal of all users is to minimize the accumulation of
   radioactive waste to those items which cannot be disposed of in any other manner. One
   suggestion is to avoid combining radioactive and non-radioactive waste such as paper
   products and ordinary laboratory waste. This will reduce volume and cost and facilitate final
   disposal. However, in the interest of reducing nonessential waste, care should be exercised
   not to inadvertently dispose of radioactive waste without regard to proper disposal
   procedures. Guidance may be obtained from the WPAFB RSO. In general, most radioactive
   waste is generated in one of two ways:
       39.1.1. Routinely, such as in a research laboratory.
       39.1.2. Infrequently, such as when a device used for many years is no longer required.
       In this case, the WPAFB RSO should be contacted as soon as the item is identified as
       excess and the WPAFB RSO shall provide specific directives for the proper management
       of the item. If the item is small, radiologically stable and presents no unusual hazard, the
       WPAFB RSO may elect to assume responsibility for the item, consolidating it with other
       similar items for more efficient disposal. If this is the case, the WPAFB RSO may store
       the items in a secure location until enough have accumulated to fill a shipping container.
   39.2. Segregation. An important aspect of proper waste disposal is segregation of waste
   (i.e., separation of different types). Segregation may involve separating:
       39.2.1. Solids from liquids. Examples are separation of solid check sources from liquid
       scintillation vials or separation of vials containing liquid scintillation fluid from surgical
       gloves, paper products and glassware which may be coated with the same fluid.
       39.2.2. High activity from low activity radionuclides. An example is separation of
       sources which are less than one millicurie from sources which are greater than or equal to
       one millicurie (one millicurie arbitrarily selected).
       39.2.3. Long half-life from short half-life radionuclides. An example is separation of
       sources which have half-lives less than 120 days from those which have half-lives greater
       than or equal to 120 days. Short half-life material may be decayed in storage and
       disposed of as non-radioactive waste if approved by the WPAFB RSO in writing. Decay
       in storage procedures are described in this instruction.
24                                       WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI40-201 25 JULY 2012


     39.2.4. Different categories of material. An example is separation of alpha emitting
     transuranics such as plutonium and americium from gamma emitting byproduct material
     such as cobalt and cesium.
     39.2.5. Chemical/biological waste from radioactive waste. An example is separation of
     radionuclides contained in animal carcasses from those contained in liquid scintillation
     vials.
     39.2.6. Commercial radioactive waste disposal facilities typically have extremely
     conservative segregation and disposal criteria. Proper segregation will eliminate the
     possibility of having to reopen the container and separate the contents at some later date
     possibly subjecting personnel to unnecessary radiation or chemical exposure. If there are
     any doubts as to the segregation procedures required, contact the WPAFB RSO.
  39.3. Containers. Radioactive waste shall only be collected in new or recently refurbished
  containers such as 30 or 55 gallon drums; size of the container will be dependent on the rate
  at which waste material is accumulated. A container should be chosen which can be filled in
  one year or less. The selected container, whether new or refurbished, must show no
  extensive signs of weathering or mishandling (i.e., no rust or dents) and must have no
  openings other than the top lid (i.e., no bung holes, even if sealed). If the container has a
  gasket on the lid, the gasket must be neoprene and no moisture is permitted inside the
  container. The NSN for an acceptable 30 gallon drum is 8110-00-866-1728 while the NSN
  for an acceptable 55 gallon drum is 8110-00-082-2626. If there are any doubts as to the
  acceptability of a container, contact the WPAFB RSO.
  39.4. Liners. The container used for radioactive waste shall have two transparent plastic
  liners or one 8 mm liner installed. The liners shall be at least 4 mils thick and be appropriate
  in size for the container used. They shall be of sufficient length so that the top of each liner
  can be twisted into a tail long enough to be folded over onto itself and the inverted "U"-
  shaped end secured with duct tape. If there are any doubts as to the acceptability of the
  plastic liners, contact the WPAFB RSO.
     39.4.1. Solids. If only solid waste is generated, the two plastic liners described above
     shall be placed one inside the other directly inside the container. Each liner shall be
     sealed individually resulting in a double encapsulation.
     39.4.2. Liquids. Liquids are not normally acceptable for radioactive waste disposal.
     Some liquids may be disposed of through the sanitary sewer; however, the decanting
     requirements must be satisfied. Other liquids such as contained in liquid scintillation
     vials are acceptable but must be collected separately from all other waste. The following
     is a summary of the procedures for packaging of liquid scintillation vials for disposal:
         39.4.2.1. For collection of liquid scintillation vials, the first liner shall be installed in
         the container, followed by at least 5 inches of absorbent material such as NSN 7930-
         00-269-1272. The amount of absorbent material must be sufficient to absorb twice
         the amount of liquid, however, DO NOT pour the liquid into the absorbent material,
         leave it in the vials. The second liner shall then be placed over this dry absorbent
         layer.
         39.4.2.2. Thus the container shall consist of the drum, a plastic liner, a layer of
         absorbent material and finally a second liner. The waste is placed inside this second
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI40-201 25 JULY 2012                                                            25


         liner. If the waste consists of liquid scintillation vials, the intact vials shall be placed
         inside this inner liner. Once the inner liner is secured, another 5 inches of absorbent
         material shall be placed on top of this sealed inner liner before the outer liner is
         sealed. This top layer of absorbent material is intended to absorb the liquid should
         the drum be turned upside down.
         39.4.2.3. The reason for this procedure is that at the disposal site, the container and
         outer liner shall be opened and the inner liner shall be removed from the container.
         Its contents shall then be placed in a machine which shall separate the liquid
         scintillation fluid from the vials. Therefore, no absorbent material or any other
         objects may be placed inside the inner liner. If there are any doubts as to the
         acceptability of the absorbent material or the packaging procedures, contact the
         WPAFB RSO.
  39.5. Inner Containers. As items are deposited in the radioactive waste drum, it is
  recommended that smaller transparent plastic containers be used to hold routine quantities of
  waste generated. For example, the waste generated each day during an experiment may be
  placed in a separate plastic container and sealed or the waste from each experiment (perhaps
  spanning several days) may be collected in a single plastic container and sealed. This
  procedure would permit a more detailed inventory of the final container contents prior to
  final sealing if there were any questions regarding the contents. Each smaller container could
  be removed and inspected without requiring the individual to sort through the actual waste
  which may pose a chemical/biological hazard, as well as radiological hazard.
  39.6. Final Closure. When a container is full and ready for disposal, the WPAFB RSO shall
  be notified. The WPAFB RSO or representative shall visually inspect the container and shall
  initial the inventory sheets to indicate that proper procedures were followed. Since items
  packaged in the drum shall not normally be removed for a detailed inventory, the WPAFB
  RSO shall not assume responsibility for problems arising as a result of incorrect inventories.
  If any problems do arise regarding the contents of the drums, it shall be the responsibility of
  the organization generating the waste to resolve those problems with guidance from qualified
  radiation safety or radioactive waste disposal personnel.
  39.7. Disposal to Sanitary Sewer. Liquid radioactive waste to be disposed through the
  sanitary sewer shall only be authorized by the WPAFB RSO. The WPAFB RSO shall review
  the types and amounts of material proposed for disposal and the procedures and shall verify
  that such disposal is authorized and does not exceed the maximum permissible quantities
  established in 10CFR20.2003. If such disposal is deemed acceptable, the WPAFB RSO shall
  designate and label a drain approved for liquid radioactive waste and only this drain shall be
  used. Material shall be flushed with a continuous stream of water (not a trickle) for the time
  indicated by WPAFB RSO.
  39.8. Decay-In-Storage (DIS). DIS may be authorized for all radioactive waste with half-
  lives less than 120 days. DIS is a procedure in which radioactive waste is placed in a storage
  container such as a drum and allowed to remain undisturbed for at least 10 half-lives. The
  material must be stable and must be maintained in a secure location where it shall not be
  disturbed during the storage interval which could extend up to 1200 days under specifically
  authorized circumstances. After the 10 half-lives have elapsed, the remaining activity shall
  be approximately one thousandth of the original activity but it must still be monitored by the
 26                                      WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI40-201 25 JULY 2012


   WPAFB RSO using an appropriately sensitive survey meter to ensure that no radiation above
   background is detectable. For DIS to be most effective, radioactive waste must be segregated
   according to half-life. Ideally, each container would contain only radionuclides with the
   same half-life. However, more realistically, the radioactive waste should be segregated into
   several categories according to half-life, such as, 1-15 days, 16-30 days, 31-45 days, 46-65
   days, and 66-120 days.
   39.9. Incineration. Authorization to incinerate can only be granted by the RIC through the
   WPAFB RSO and must be specified as a condition to a WPAFB radioactive material permit
   before it can be accomplished. Incineration shall normally only be approved for cases where
   disposal to a commercial radioactive waste burial site is difficult or impossible such as for
   animal carcasses or mixed chemical/biological/radioactive waste where the incineration of
   the chemical and biological components is not restricted. Applicable federal and state air
   emission requirements must be complied with.
   39.10. Specific Waste. The NRC has authorized the disposal of some small quantities of
   radioactive waste as normal waste. This authorization applies only to carbon-14 (C-14) and
   hydrogen-3 (H-3), also known as tritium. Specifically, 10 CFR 20.2005, states that C-14 and
   H-3 may be disposed of without regard to radioactivity, if the amount is less than or equal to
   0.05 microcurie per gram of medium used for liquid scintillation counting or per gram of
   animal tissue averaged over the weight of the entire animal. This exemption does not
   eliminate the requirement to dispose of the scintillation fluid and carcasses according to
   applicable chemical and biological waste disposal instructions. In addition, the instruction
   requires records of the amount disposed be maintained to ensure compliance.
   39.11. Records. Every item that is placed into a waste disposal container, flushed down an
   approved drain, incinerated or allowed to DIS, shall be recorded. A separate form shall be
   maintained by the generator for each container, each drain, and each incinerator and all of the
   columns listed on the form shall be completed. If inner containers are used they should be
   numbered consecutively and the inventory should indicate into which inner container each
   item of waste was placed. When a container is ready to be sealed for disposal or DIS, the
   WPAFB RSO shall be informed.

Section L—POSTING REQUIREMENTS

40. Documents Posted. Except as otherwise specified, copies of this instruction, 10 CFR Part
19 and Part 20, applicable AF permit, permit conditions, documents referenced in the permit and
NRC Form 3, Notice to Employees, shall be posted in at least one conspicuous location within
each work area where activities involving the use of radioactive material are conducted.
41. Alternative Posting. If posting of a document specified above is not practical, with the
exception of NRC Form 3, Notice to Employees a notice may be posted which describes the
document and states where it may be reviewed. Copies of the references listed in this instruction
and other pertinent documents concerning the use of radioactive material are maintained by the
WPAFB RSO in building 89, area C, at extension 72010. The notice shall state that the
documents are available for review during normal duty hours.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI40-201 25 JULY 2012                                                          27


42. Radiation Exposure Posting. The AF Listing 1499 lists each individual’s radiation
exposure record. This form is provided to supervisors at the end of each monitoring period and
should also be made available for review.

Section M—EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

43. Emergency Situations. Potential radiation hazards may include:
   43.1. Spills of RAM. A spill is not limited to liquids. Release of radioactive material from
   its container irrespective of the form of the material is considered a spill. The material may
   be in powdered form, liquid, gas, or a solid mass. Spills pose a hazard because of the
   potential for: (1) contamination of the environment, (2) contamination of the skin of
   personnel, (3) ingestion or inhalation of RAM, and (4) production of a high radiation field
   which may result in a radiation dose exceeding permissible limits even if the individual does
   not become externally contaminated. A spill may result from a simple incident such as the
   dropping of a container or it may result from a more serious event such as a fire or explosion.
   43.2. Production of a radiation field by an x-ray machine, irradiator, accelerator or
   radioactive material (even if the material is completely contained). An x-ray machine,
   radioisotope irradiator, or accelerator may be emitting radiation when it is supposed to be off,
   such as; when a switch or circuit malfunctions and the unit does not shut down when
   switched off or it may be emitting radiation into an area where it is not expected, such as;
   when an accelerator beam is deflected into the wrong experimental area. In these instances,
   individuals may be exposed to high radiation fields possibly without their knowledge.
44. Response Procedures:
   44.1. Differences in response to the two situations described above include:
       44.1.1. For spills, the material must be confined to prevent further contamination and
       individuals/environment may require decontamination.
       44.1.2. For radiation fields, individuals must be removed from the radiation field or the
       radiation source must be interrupted (e.g., turning off the x-ray machine or shielding the
       irradiator source).
       44.1.3. For both cases, the primary concern is first, the protection of individuals in the
       vicinity including emergency response personnel and second, the protection of the
       environment. Life saving activities always takes priority over other considerations. In
       fact relatively large personnel exposures may be permitted for life saving procedures.
       This, however, is a one time permissible exposure which can never be repeated.
       Essential first aid always takes precedence over decontamination.
   44.2. Emergency procedures are divided into two categories:
       44.2.1. The first category involves generic response procedures, that is, procedures
       applicable to most situations.
       44.2.2. The second category involves site-specific response procedures, that is,
       procedures unique to a specific location or situation.
       44.2.3. This instruction describes typical generic response procedures. Site-specific
       procedures are developed by the user during application for a WPAFB radioactive
 28                                      WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI40-201 25 JULY 2012


      material permit. Copies of both generic and site-specific emergency response procedures
      are maintained by the WPAFB RSO and are made available to emergency response teams
      such as the fire department, security police and disaster preparedness. The WPAFB RSO
      shall either direct or delegate responsibility for all radioactive material cleanup
      operations.
45. Generic Emergency Response Procedures:
   45.1. Spills. An acronym used by some groups to assist in recalling spill control procedures
   is SWIMS which stands for:
      45.1.1. Stop the spill.
      45.1.2. Warn others.
      45.1.3. Isolate the area.
      45.1.4. Minimize the exposure.
      45.1.5. Secure the area and prevent any non-filtered exhaust.
NOTE: A somewhat more detailed explanation of the procedures is presented below:
      45.1.6. Prepare for a spill by having a "spill kit" readily available complete with all of
      the items required to respond.
      45.1.7. Advise all personnel not directly involved with the initial spill incident or the
      subsequent cleanup to evacuate the area. Anyone suspected of being contaminated
      during the incident or cleanup should not leave the area until monitored and
      decontaminated if necessary.
      45.1.8. One individual should assume responsibility for immediate actions. This is not
      the time to argue protocol or seniority. Just as for CPR where the individual who starts
      CPR is in charge until he/she relinquishes control, so, in a spill, the individual who starts
      giving commands should continue to do so until a more qualified and knowledgeable
      individual arrives on scene.
      45.1.9. Stop the spill if possible. This may involve turning a container right side up,
      capping it or throwing some material over the source to absorb or reduce the emissions.
      In either case, the benefit of performing this activity (e.g., preventing contamination from
      spreading to uncontrolled areas) must be balanced by the risk to the individual
      performing it (e.g., contamination, inhalation or exposure of the individual). If all of the
      contents have escaped from the container, don't waste time capping it.
      45.1.10. Warn individuals not involved in the spill to evacuate the area. Designate
      someone to call for assistance. Call the WPAFB RSO and others, such as the supervisor,
      radiation monitor, or emergency response teams (e.g., fire department or ambulances) as
      required. The WPAFB RSO shall ensure that all notifications required by AFI 40-201
      and 10 CFR 20.2201 and 20.2202, are accomplished
      45.1.11. Determine extent of the spill. If liquid or solid, try to mark boundaries. If gas,
      which areas are affected.
      45.1.12. Secure non-filtered exhaust and any other pathways outside the area (e.g., air
      vents, windows, drains, etc.).
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI40-201 25 JULY 2012                                                       29


     45.1.13. Don protective equipment such as gloves, boots, anti-contamination clothing,
     and respirators. Minimize the number of personnel involved. Protective gear such as self
     contained breathing apparatus and bunker suits used by firefighters shall normally
     provide sufficient protection from contamination although monitoring should be
     accomplished prior to removing such equipment to prevent inadvertent contamination.
     45.1.14. Measure radiation levels. Use meters, air samplers, etc.
     45.1.15. Monitor all personnel. Obtain all information necessary to perform follow-up
     evaluations on personnel (e.g., name, address, phone numbers, SSAN, location at scene,
     duration of exposure, etc.). Check individuals for external contamination. If clothing is
     contaminated, remove it. If skin is contaminated, shower or wash, depending on
     available facilities. Although contamination should not be permitted to enter the sanitary
     system, personnel decontamination takes priority. Consider the need for internal
     evaluation (i.e., bioassay sampling such as urine, feces, nasal swabs, etc.). Bioassay
     samples are best collected immediately (provided external contamination of the sample is
     not a problem) and again after 24 hours. The WPAFB RSO shall provide guidance on
     follow-up sampling intervals.
     45.1.16. Monitor environment and surfaces. Clean up if contaminated and collect all
     waste in plastic bags and place in sturdy containers.
     45.1.17. For fires, water should be used sparingly since it may tend to spread
     contamination.
     45.1.18. Radioactive material not involved in the incident should not be moved.
     Transporting sources to an alternate storage location during an incident to safeguard them
     is not recommended. Such actions tend to increase the possibility of personnel exposure
     or contamination due to accidental spills in transit. It is also possible that such actions
     could cause a loss of control over the sources. Under normal circumstances, the location
     of most sources shall be known in advance and measures can be taken to deal with them.
     However, if an attempt is made to move sources, the attempt may not be successful and
     response personnel might not then be aware of their new location. This could pose a
     greater hazard than initially existed.
     45.1.19. After the cleanup has been completed, a report of the incident shall be prepared
     as directed by the WPAFB RSO and a copy submitted to the WPAFB RSC.
  45.2. Radiation Fields. Accidents involving potential exposure to radiation fields are in
  general easier to deal with than spills although no less hazardous. The following procedures
  are recommended:
     45.2.1. Shut down the source. For an x-ray unit this may involve interrupting the
     electrical supply either at the unit or at a main panel while for a radioisotope irradiator
     containing radioactive material it may be necessary to shield the source. In some cases it
     may not be possible to stop the radiation.
     45.2.2. One individual should assume responsibility for immediate actions.
     45.2.3. Warn others of the problem and send for assistance from the WPAFB RSO and
     others.
 30                                       WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI40-201 25 JULY 2012


       45.2.4. Isolate the area by closing doors or setting up improvised barriers to prevent
       entry. Be certain that no one is in the area before securing it.
       45.2.5. After the situation has been corrected, a report of the incident shall be prepared as
       directed by the WPAFB RSO.
46. Emergency Response Teams:
   46.1. The WPAFB RSO or a member of the staff shall provide initial training and annual
   refresher training to all personnel who may be called on to respond to accidents/incidents
   involving radioactive material or radiation-producing devices.
   46.2. Supervisors shall be responsible for informing the WPAFB RSO of newly assigned
   personnel to permit scheduling of initial training.
   46.3. A listing of locations where radioactive material or radiation-producing devices are
   stored or used, a summary of the sources located in each area and a copy of the site-specific
   emergency procedures provided by the organization possessing the sources shall be made
   available to each emergency response team.

Section N—Reporting Requirements

47. Mishaps, Incidents, and Accidents. Any abnormal occurrence involving radioactive
material or radiation-producing device shall be reported by the using organization to the WPAFB
RSO immediately after the abnormal occurrence becomes known. Based on the severity of the
occurrence, as specified in AFI 91-204 and AFI 40-201, the WPAFB RSO shall notify the
following:
   47.1. 88 ABW/CC/DV/JA/PA/SE.
   47.2. AFMSA/SGP3B.
   47.3. HQ USAF/SGOE.
   47.4. HQ AFMC/SGPC/A7C/.
   47.5. Other interested organizations with jurisdiction such as US Environmental Protection
   Agency, Food and Drug Administration or State of Ohio.
48. Notice of Violation or Hazard:
   48.1. Any worker or representative of workers who believes that a violation of NRC or AF
   instructions or permit conditions has occurred, or that any defect in facilities or equipment
   exists which may pose a hazard to personnel or the environment shall report such conditions
   to:
       48.1.1. The immediate supervisor, permit RSO, branch or division chief, or department
       chairperson.
       48.1.2. The WPAFB RSO at extension 72010. In absence of the WPAFB RSO, reports
       may be made to the Chairperson of the WPAFB RSC.
   48.2. Initial reports may be submitted verbally; however, a written report shall be submitted
   within five workdays for proper documentation (AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report, may
   be used). The willful failure to report such violations or hazards to personnel in accordance
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI40-201 25 JULY 2012                                                         31


   with procedures provided in this section may be considered a dereliction of duty and could
   result in disciplinary action.
   48.3. Requests for inspection of violations or defects involving radioactive material
   possessed under authority of a NRC license or AF radioactive material permit may be made
   to the Installation IG or directly, in writing, to the RIC, AF IG, or the NRC Office of
