                                            Chapter 1

                                            MISSION

NOTE: The Acronym “AFW” Is Used As A Convenience Term Throughout This Document. It
Refers To The Af’s Weather Functional Community That Supports National, Joint, Af, And
Army Operations. It Is Inclusive Of All Forces, Units, And Specialties That Are Involved In
Conducting Weather Operations And Providing Weather Services. It Does Not Imply Any
Organizational Or Unit Alignment, Nor An Air Force Specialty (AFS) Alignment. Specific
Organizations, Specialties, And Units Will Be Cited When Critical To Understanding And
Technical Accuracy Within This Document.

1.1. Mission. AFW forces, as part of the joint team, deliver accurate, consistent, relevant and
timely environmental information, products and services, anywhere in the world. Executing
their core competencies to collect, analyze, predict, tailor, and proactively integrate
environmental threat information into commanders’ decision cycles [i.e., Joint Operational
Planning Process (JOPP), Military Decision Making Process (MDMP), Intelligence Preparation
of the Battlespace (IPB), operational risk management (ORM) processes, Common Operating
Picture (COP)] and C4ISR systems, AFW forces enable commanders at all levels to anticipate,
mitigate the impact of, and exploit the weather; optimizing air, space, cyberspace, and ground
operations to the advantage of allied objectives and the detriment of the adversary.
       1.1.1. Characterization. Characterization encompasses the “collect, analyze and
       predict” weather core competencies. Characterization depends on the ability to collect
       accurate data, to effectively, correctly analyze that data, and to use the results to produce
       a coherent picture of the present and future state of the air and space environment.
       1.1.2. Exploitation. Exploitation is the ability to minimize the impact of environmental
       threats to friendly forces while simultaneously capitalizing on environmental conditions
       that maximize the operational advantage over enemy forces. AFW enables decision
       makers to plan and execute weather-optimized courses of action through timely injection
       of mission-tailored environmental threat information at every decision point in the
       mission planning and execution process.
          1.1.2.1. Tailoring. Tailoring is the extraction of data that is pertinent to a specific
          mission profile from the overall characterization of the air and space environment.
          This information can be spatial, temporal or both, but will always focus on the
          mission profile and the associated mission-limiting weather thresholds. Tailoring
          does not mean changing the characterization of the air and space environment.
          Weather organizations charged with tailoring and exploitation will use the
          characterized data provided to them.
          1.1.2.2. Integration. Integration is the ability to inject the right information at the
          right time every time. The foundation of exploitation, integration is built upon two
          tenets: knowledge and relationships.
              1.1.2.2.1. Knowledge. Missions are affected by a wide variety of environmental
              threats, requiring operational commanders and mission planners to understand the
              threats most likely to impair their mission’s effectiveness. AFW leaders must
AFI15-128 7 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                     5


           identify and understand specific impacts of the environment on those missions,
           translate those impacts into the mission-language of their supported warfighters
           for action, and impart this expertise to their subordinate weather personnel
           through enduring training, processes, and procedures. It is crucial to understand
           not only the capabilities and sensitivities of mission platforms, equipment and
           systems but also mission processes (e.g., mission analysis, planning, course of
           action (COA) development/comparison/ selection, and execution) and the points
           where weather processes must intersect or work in parallel with these mission
           processes. For example, when supporting the Army, one needs to be intimately
           involved in the MDMP process, and know key decision points that will influence
           the process and optimize the outcome. It is the responsibility of AFW leaders and
           their subordinates to actively seek this knowledge using every available resource,
           starting with their supported warfighters.
           1.1.2.2.2. Relationships. AFW leaders must be proactively involved with their
           supported organizations, building trust through the skillful application of weather
           and mission-based expertise to maintain commanders’ environmental awareness,
           optimize mission planning, and achieve mission success. To be effective, these
           relationships must be established and actively maintained with the supported
           organizations’ key operational decision makers, operators, intelligence specialists,
           tactical-level mission planners, schedulers, and weapons and tactics experts.
           Once established, AFW personnel will be able to quickly adapt to process and/or
           mission changes.

                                 WEATHER SQUADRONS

4.1. Operational Weather Squadrons. OWSs are the authoritative source for environmental
characterization in their respective AORs as identified in AFVA 15-136, Air Force Operational
Weather Squadron Areas of Responsibility - CONUS and AFVA 15-137, Air Force Operational
Weather Squadron Areas of Responsibility. OWSs are responsible for collection of atmospheric
data/information, analysis and prediction of the atmosphere, and generation of products based on
this analysis and prediction for use by WFs and other agencies. OWSs are also responsible for
the upgrade and on-the-job training of weather apprentices and new officer accessions. Note: It
is to be assumed that the roles and responsibilities of an OWS described below apply to its AOR.
OWSs will:
   4.1.1. Coordinate, maintain, annually review and electronically host installation data pages
   defining specific environmental support requirements, technical data, reference material, and
   contact information for each organization receiving TAF and WWA support from the OWS.
   This installation data page will take the place of the OWS-WF MOA. Where multiple WFs
   exist on one installation, separate data pages will be hosted.
   4.1.2. Perform meteorological watch (METWATCH) for supported installations.
   4.1.3. Produce, disseminate, and amend TAFs to support military operations.
   Specification/amendment (SPEC/AMD) criteria will be driven by supported mission and/or
   installation specific thresholds and will be applied to the entire TAF period. These criteria,
   for each installation, will be coordinated between the OWS and the responsible WF using the
   electronic data page on that installation’s tailored web-page. If there is no WF responsible
   to support an organization, the supporting OWS will liaise directly with the supported
   organization to determine SPEC/AMD criteria.
   4.1.4. Produce forecast reviews based on objective criteria IAW AFMAN 15-129, Air and
   Space Weather Operations – Processes and Procedures, and make the products available for
   use external to the OWS.
   4.1.5. Produce, disseminate, and amend forecast weather watches, warnings, and advisories
   (WWA) for locations with documented WWA requirements. OWSs will also issue special
   weather statements (SWS) to keep supported organizations apprised of possible future
   atmospheric conditions that are under evaluation and could pose a serious  threat to the
   warfighter’s capability to operate.
       4.1.5.1. Produce and disseminate observed weather warnings and observed weather
       advisories as required and coordinated for WFs if sensing capability exists.
       4.1.5.2. Disseminate SWS to WF personnel for evaluation and possible further
       dissemination/integration into the parent/host unit’s risk management decision cycle.
       4.1.5.3. For those installations/organizations without a supporting WF, the OWS may
       disseminate the SWS directly to installation/organizational leadership.

  4.1.6. Provide summaries of current OWS-issued SWS and WWA via Non-Classified
  Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) and SECRET Internet Protocol Router Network
  (SIPRNet) homepages.
  4.1.7. Document specific actions or plans executed to focus support when severe weather is
  expected or occurring in their AOR (e.g., SOPs describing reallocation of OWS resources
  from other tasks to focused support to a specific region in their AOR).
  4.1.8. Ensure all OWS weather products and visualizations are horizontally consistent.
  4.1.9. Coordinate forecast areas along the borders of standardized OWS-produced regional
  visualizations to facilitate meshing of regions into large-scale visualizations resulting in an
  integrated picture of weather features.
     4.1.9.1. Ensure graphics products that overlap an adjacent OWS's AOR either depict
     features from the adjacent AOR as forecasted by the adjacent OWS or gray out areas
     outside their assigned AOR on graphic products.
  4.1.10. Where applicable, OWSs may use/post other US Government agency or host nation
  products within their designated AOR, provided they are not used in lieu of OWS
  created/mandated products.
  4.1.11. Produce and disseminate automated Air Refueling Route Forecasts and Military
  Operating Area Forecasts for further use by WFs and WSTs.
 4.1.12. Produce FITL (first 48 hours)/automated hybrid five-day site forecasts for all TAF
 sites and other point locations documented with supported agencies. The first 24 hours of the
 five day forecast will match the TAF for that location and will be amendable to maintain
 horizontal consistency with the TAF. The last three to five days will be automated. Note:
 Sites or point locations which have no WF, but for which the OWS has resource protection
 responsibility, may have an automated five-day if no requirement for FITL/hybrid 5-day is
 stated by the supported agency.
 4.1.13. Respond to Special Assistance Requests (SARs) to provide meteorological data and
 produce meteorological products for non-routine missions and areas.
     4.1.13.1. Upon request from installations without a supporting WF, OWS’s will serve as
     weather SME to the installation Civil Engineering Squadron Readiness Flight (CEXR),
     Fire Emergency Services (CEF), and Medical Group’s Bioenvironmental Engineering
     Flight. Information will be provided to help optimize weather data input to CDMs,
     EDMs, and CBRN hazard-prediction models used by the above emergency support
     functions (ESF). This information will help enhance decision making capability within
     the installation EOC, CBRN Control Center, and at the incident site.

         all Special Operations Forces (SOF) training and operations worldwide. The 23 WS is
         capable of providing point and area MWPs precisely tailored to meet SOF mission
         requirements. Since 23 WS works for SOF operators deployed across all Geographic
         Combatant Commands (GCCs), 23 WS must closely coordinate product development
         with affected OWSs to ensure horizontal consistency within the GCC Area of Operations.
         23 WS will support the OWS by assuming responsibility for development of high-fidelity
         products for SOF operating within the OWS’s geographic area of responsibility. In the
         event that a Joint exercise, mission, or operation is predominately SOF, the 23 WS is
         capable of functioning as the JMCO when requested by the SMO or JMO, through
         United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) for GCCs, and coordinated
         with the appropriate OWS.
         4.5.1.2. Provide mission planning and mission execution forecasts (MEFs) to deployed
         SOF operators without direct support weather personnel.

   environmental threats to operations associated with the upcoming season. OWSs will make
   their seasonal training packages available for world-wide consumption. EWXSs are exempt
   (personnel should be current prior to their deployment), but should focus on the seasonal
   threats relative to their respective theaters (through daily discussions, chats, etc).
   4.6.2. Perform qualification, upgrade, and mobility training to ensure all deployable
   personnel can achieve and maintain the proficiency required to support tasked deployed
   operations. EWXSs are exempt (personnel should be current prior to their deployment) but
   will evaluate all         personnel arriving in-theater to determine if they possess
   appropriate/documented skills and qualifications needed to meet mission requirements.
   Note: Personnel can be sent home from the theater if they do not possess the appropriate
   skills/qualifications needed to support the mission.
   4.6.3. Conduct and document initial certification checkrides and annual recertification
   checkrides on primary duty position. Checkrides completed as part of pre-deployment
   preparation satisfy this requirement if the evaluated tasks cover those tasks performed in the
   primary duty position. This section does not apply to EWXSs.
   4.6.4. Conduct and document training and certification in the Air Force Training Record
   (AFTR) IAW the 1W0XX Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP).

       WEATHER FLIGHTS, DETACHMENTS AND OPERATING LOCATIONS

6.1. Weather Flights (WF). WF is the generic term used in this document to describe WFs,
detachments, and operating locations whose primary purpose is to facilitate exploitation of the
environment through integration into every phase of operations-planning and execution
processes. WFs assess the mission environment to determine environmental threats, and where
possible, find alternatives to mitigate those threats. Each flight has unique characteristics and
functions based on its parent/host unit’s mission, geographic location and level of command.
Core roles, responsibilities, processes and procedures will largely be the same. WFs support the
entire spectrum of Air Force, Army, and Special Operations’ Active and Reserve Component
mission types including but not limited to: aviation and ground operations conducted at home
station and deployed locations. WFs are also responsible to support other parent/host unit
operations where success may depend on mitigation of environmental threats (Civil Engineering,
Logistics, Communications, etc.). WF functions include the Staff Integration function, Mission
Integration function and the Airfield Support function.
6.2. General. WFs will:
   6.2.1. Provide direct staff, mission planning and execution weather support in garrison and at
   deployed locations. WFs should, when possible, deploy with their parent/host units to
   provide support (e.g., contingency, exercise, off-station employment, etc.).
       6.2.1.1. If unable to support deployed parent/host unit directly, accomplish support via
       reachback to home station. Note: When parent/host unit assets deploy across COCOMs
       (e.g., a Combat Aviation Brigade or F-16 Squadron deploys to Iraq from CONUS),
       reachback support is not required from the parent/host WF. Daily weather support to the
       deployed unit(s) will be provided through the respective COCOM WFs.
       6.2.1.2. If unable to support deployed parent/host unit via reachback to home station,
       arrange for support to be provided by the supporting OWS or by the WF in-place at the
       operating location.
   6.2.2. Comply with AR 115-10/AFI 15-157 (IP) when providing support to Army units as
   required.
   6.2.3. Establish daily hours of operation and flex/surge to meet the operational mission
   needs of the parent/host unit. Reachback to the OWS, while an acceptable practice during
   manning constraints, will not be routinely substituted in place of direct support with which
   the WF is tasked/responsible. Therefore, WFs will schedule their personnel around mission
   requirements, not airfield hours of operation, unless required to manually take or augment
   automated observations as required by AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations.
       6.2.3.1. Personnel will be on duty during published airfield hours (at a minimum) if the
       WF is augmenting the observation or is operating as a manual station.
       6.2.3.2. WFs are not required to have personnel on duty when airfield is closed unless
       the Severe Weather Action Plan (SWAP) has been implemented and/or support to
       parent/host unit operational mission dictates.

        6.2.3.3. When possible, coordinate requirements with the supporting OWS for flight
        weather briefing support to those Army VFR flights conducted outside normal
        squadron/battalion operations when the airfield is closed and/or weather personnel are
        unavailable.
        6.2.3.4. WFs will coordinate requests for briefing support with the supporting OWS on
        larger operations when the weather organization cannot provide exploitation products to
        the host unit due to manning levels or Temporary Duty (TDY) commitments.
  6.2.4. WFs will not have personnel on duty solely to provide briefings for Aero Club flying
  activities. During normal operating hours, WFs will provide flight weather briefings to Aero
  Club members performing official Air Force operational duties (e.g., Civil Air Patrol and
  Initial Flying Training Programs). Aero Club members performing official flight duties
  outside of normal operating hours should be advised of remote and self-briefing capabilities.
  6.2.5. Provide service IAW posted duty priorities for walk-in requests    from        transient
  aircrews. When transient or staged aircrews request briefing support, WFs will:
        6.2.5.1. Provide a briefing or update an existing briefing form as time and resources
        allow. EXCEPTION: Refer flight weather briefing requests for AMC, USAFE, and
        PACAF integrated flight-management (IFM) missions to the appropriate IFM weather
        support agency (e.g. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOW, 21 OWS, and 17 OWS respectively).
        WFs may provide access to meteorological satellite imagery, take off data, and other
        perishable weather data for IFM crews upon request, but will refer the aircrew to their
        supporting IFM weather organization for weather updates to the actual mission package.
        6.2.5.2. If unable to provide a briefing or update an existing briefing, provide contact
        information for the supporting OWS and direct the aircrew to Airfield Operations-
        provided terminals for online access to weather support. Assist aircrew as time permits.
  6.2.6. Relay pertinent information to supporting OWS concerning changing local conditions
  that significantly diverge from forecasted conditions, especially affecting resource protection
  or the TAF.
  6.2.7. Provide PMSV when contacted by aircrew via phone patch or any other
  communications device.
  6.2.8. If equipped as a Solar Electro-Optical Network site, provide solar observations IAW
  AFWAI 15-2, Space Environmental Observations, Solar Optical And Radio Observing.
     6.2.9. Provide upper air observations IAW FMH 3, Rawinsonde and Pibal Observations, as
     required to support garrison/deployed operations, if equipped with upper air observing
     equipment. Disseminate observations to AFWA and the appropriate OWS to supplement
     other upper air observations or provide observations in data-sparse regions.
  6.2.10. Forward requests from foreign nations for DoD weather data, imagery, technical
  information, and software tools through appropriate FDO and STINFO to respective
  MAJCOM weather functional.
  6.2.11. Incorporate the MIRF and RIRF managed by the supporting OWS into qualification
  and continuation training. WFs will contribute pertinent METSAT imagery or radar
  signatures that may be of training value to the supporting OWS for consideration for
  inclusion into the MIRF/RIRF.
AFI15-128 7 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                   29


  6.2.12. Identify local or fine scale influences on weather parameters yielding empirical
  evidence that may support establishment of a rule of thumb (ROT) for the installation and
  military operating areas. These will be identified as observed and passed on to the
  supporting OWS for validation. The WF role will not exceed gathering and furnishing of
  information.
  6.2.13. Conduct seasonal continuation training, at least quarterly, concentrating on
  environmental threats to operations associated with the upcoming season. Training should
  focus on environmental sensitivity thresholds pertinent to DoD full-spectrum operations
  including, but not limited to, supported weapons systems, platforms, mission profiles, TTPs,
  mission-essential task lists (METLs), and integration of environmental threats into JOPP,
  MDMP, IPB, C4ISR systems, ORM processes and the COP. WFs will leverage seasonal
  training material from their supporting OWS.
  6.2.14. Perform qualification, upgrade, and mobility training to ensure all deployable
  personnel can achieve and maintain the proficiency required to support tasked deployed
  operations.
  6.2.15. Conduct initial certification checkrides and annual recertification checkrides on
  primary duty position(s). Document initial certification and recertification on AF Form
  1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, regardless of rank. All personnel
  will be position qualified to operate from an Alternate Operating Location (AOL).
  6.2.16. Conduct and document training and certification in the AFTR IAW the 1W0XX
  CFETP.
  6.2.17. Support U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine missions on Joint Bases where the AF has the
  lead for base operations and sustainment support provided those missions do not require
  specialized support and are akin to support normally given to AF and Army units. This
  support will not drive additional manpower or other costs to the AF without an interservice
  agreement coordinated at HQ USAF/A3O-W.
  6.2.18. Coordinate support for Air Force remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), controlled via
  remote split operations (RSO), with the WF directly supporting the RSO C2 center (e.g., 432
  OSS/OSW, 9 OSS/OSW, 3 SOS/WX). For go/no-go weather recommendations affecting the
  RSO phase of a mission (e.g., pre-mission planning, weather recall or dynamic re-tasking of
  an airborne RPA), WFs will defer to the WF directly supporting the RSO C2 center. MWPs
  for launch and recovery element (LRE) and divert locations, whether provided by a
  collocated WF or OWS via reachback, will include RPA mission-limiting weather thresholds
  as determined by the RSO C2 center. To ensure combat forces at all echelons receive
  consistent information, the WF supporting the RSO C2 element will inform other weather
  elements involved in the mission (e.g., WF collocated with a LRE, AOC WST, JOC, etc.)
  when RPA operations are affected by weather as soon as practical.
  6.2.19. Ensure RPAs tasked to deploy without organic weather forces receive weather
  support from gaining weather team assigned to the deployed C2 function. Only Group 3
  (e.g., RQ-7B Shadow, MQ-5B Hunter, MQ-1C Grey Eagle) or larger RPA will receive
  mission-specific aviation weather support (i.e., similar to a UH-60, AH-64, etc.); Group 2 or
  smaller RPA (e.g., RQ-11B Raven, Scan Eagle) will receive general weather support (i.e.,
  “area forecasts” not tailored to specific missions), as defined in AR 115-10/AFI 15-157 (IP).
 30                                                           AFI15-128 7 FEBRUARY 2011


   Weather products for launch/recovery (L/R) locations, whether provided by a collocated WF
   or OWS via reachback, will include critical RPA environmental sensitivity thresholds as
   determined by the C2 entity responsible for the RPA. To ensure combat forces at all
   echelons receive consistent information, the WF supporting RPA operations will inform
   other weather elements involved in the mission [e.g., BCT WF, Division WF, AOC WST (if
   the RPA mission was included on the ATO), JOC/TOC, etc.] when RPA operations are
   affected by weather as soon as practical. Note: Refer to Joint Concept of Operations for
   Unmanned Aircraft Systems (25 Nov 08) for definitions of RPA Groups. In addition, for the
   purpose of this publication RPA and UAS are synonymous.
6.3. WF Commander/WF Chief and NCOIC. For brevity, the term “WF leadership” will be
used in place of WF Commander, WF Chief, OIC and NCOIC unless duties specific to
individual positions apply. One of the essential responsibilities of WF leadership is to gain an
intimate knowledge of the various missions their parent/host unit is tasked with supporting or
executing, identify and understand specific impacts of the environment on those missions, and
impart this to their subordinates through enduring processes and procedures. This is
accomplished through establishing relationships with key decisionmakers in the supported
agencies based on open, continuing communication. Leadership must be proactively involved
with these agencies, building trust through the consistent application of weather skills and
mission-based knowledge to enhance and achieve mission success. WF leadership will:
   6.3.1. Engage with base/post agencies to determine weather support requirements.
       6.3.1.1. To the maximum extent possible, document weather support in appropriate
       existing parent/host unit plans and directives [e.g., Installation Emergency Management
       Plan 10-2 (IEMP 10-2) and any other applicable plans containing an Annex H or weather
       appendix]. Stand-alone weather support documents covering specific support, unable to
       be documented elsewhere, are allowed but should be kept to a minimum.
       6.3.1.2. Determine parent/host organization WWA criteria, required lead-times and
       notification requirements. This information will be coordinated with the supporting
       OWS and documented on the installation data page.
       6.3.1.3. Assist parent/host unit in creation of a dissemination plan for WWA information
       to ensure base/post agencies consistently receive timely notification of potential and/or
       forecasted significant weather events that may impact local operations and/or damage
       base/post resources.
           6.3.1.3.1. AF WFs will assist in creation of the IEMP 10-2 Appendix A IAW AFI
           10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and
           Operations.
       6.3.1.4. Coordinate dissemination plan with supporting OWS for use with an automated
       warning dissemination system and document in the installation data page.
   6.3.2. Establish outage reporting procedures for weather equipment and communications
   systems with the appropriate garrison/deployed maintenance unit and with the AFWA
   Consolidated Support Center (CSC).
   6.3.3. Coordinate with parent/host command structure to ensure WF personnel have
   appropriate security clearance for, and are granted access to, mission planning and execution
AFI15-128 7 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                   31


  information required to properly exploit air and space environmental information and
  mitigate environmental threats to mission success.
  6.3.4. Document supported operations’ (1) mission profiles, (2) planning and execution
  phases, and (3) environmental sensitivities and train all personnel on them.
  6.3.5. Use the applicable portions of the HQ USAF, AFWA and parent MAJCOM (if
  applicable) weather compliance performance checklists to perform a unit self-inspection
  within 90 days of a change in senior WF leadership and annually thereafter.
  6.3.6. Complete all AF-directed and locally determined training and certification
  requirements for all local WF duty positions within 120 days of assignment.
  6.3.7. Schedule operations (opening/closing hours, manpower allocation, etc) around the
  battle rhythm of the supported mission. Operations must be flexible enough to respond to
  daily changes in battle rhythm.
  6.3.8. Coordinate deployment posturing and logistic requirements through appropriate
  channels (e.g. MAJCOM FAM, Unit Deployment Manager, Logistics Squadron, Army G-
  4/S-4 or G-2/S-2).
  6.3.9. Develop and implement SWAP operations to ensure sufficient personnel are available
  during potential/actual severe weather events or during meteorological/operational events
  critical to mission success. WF leadership will determine which environmental conditions
  require SWAP. For garrison operations, SWAP may be linked to watch/warning products
  (reference AFI 10-229, Responding To Severe Weather Events, for additional guidance). At
  expeditionary locations, SWAP is integral to resource protection; exact processes and
  procedures may be limited at austere locations or during combat/maneuver phases of military
  operations. See also AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations, for guidance on
  augmentation of automated weather observing systems during SWAP.
  6.3.10. Develop procedures to provide appropriate information to the installation agency
  (usually the command post) that prepares Operational Report 3 (OPREP-3) reports for the
  installation commander IAW AFI 10-229. For AF WFs, severe weather events are reported
  to the command agency of the supported location IAW OPREP-3 reporting procedures in
  AFMAN 10-206, Operational Reporting. Army support WFs will follow locally coordinated
  procedures. Ensure the OWS and the parent MAJCOM weather functional (or equivalent)
  are aware of the OPREP-3 report.
  6.3.11. Develop an evacuation/relocation plan that provides continuity of operations in the
  event normal work centers are unavailable. Use parent/host unit plans where possible, and
  coordinate actions with other agency evacuation plans [Air Traffic Control (ATC), Airfield
  Operations, Flying Squadrons, etc.].
  6.3.12. Coordinate with ATC agencies to develop ATC local procedures to ensure weather
  technicians receive PIREPs relayed to ATC. Local operating procedures should include
  timeliness requirements [e.g., ATC/supervisor of flying (SOF) will relay pilot report (PIREP)
  information to weather not later than 5 minutes after receipt].
  6.3.13. Provide information to the Airfield Manager or appropriate base/post agency for
  Flight Information Publications (FLIPs). WFs will validate the accuracy of the information
  each time the FLIP is published and take immediate steps to correct erroneous data.
 32                                                           AFI15-128 7 FEBRUARY 2011


   6.3.14. Ensure MWPs meet the operational requirements of the installation supervisor of
   flying (SOF) or Army equivalent.
   6.3.15. Ensure newly assigned WF personnel are given a thorough orientation before
   position qualification including at a minimum:
       6.3.15.1. Physically visit all meteorological sensors on the airfield and discuss site
       limitations and their effects on operations.
       6.3.15.2. Tour ATC facilities (tower and radar facility) and discuss cooperative weather
       watch procedures and how local weather impacts flight operations.
       6.3.15.3. Visit operational supported agencies and discuss mission and weapons systems'
       weather sensitivities. At a minimum, this will include flying squadrons, aviation
       operation centers, command posts, Emergency Operations Centers (EOC), CBRN
       Control Centers, Brigade Combat Teams (BCT), Support Brigades, Divisions and Corps.
       6.3.15.4. Visit the SOF and/or flight safety duty section(s) to discuss SOF/flight safety
       processes and how timely and accurate weather information enhances flight safety.
   6.3.16. Determine parent/host organization SPEC/AMD criteria and coordinate this support
   with the supporting OWS. This information will be documented on the installation data
   page.
6.4. Staff Integration Function. Personnel executing the Staff integration function will:
   6.4.1. Liaise directly with the parent/host unit commander and staff to relay pertinent
   information on environmental threats to parent/host unit mission.
   6.4.2. Evaluate SWSs issued by the supporting OWS for environmental threats to the
   parent/host unit and integrate the resulting information into risk management decision cycles.
   6.4.3. Liaise directly with supported base/post agencies to determine new mission
   requirements, validate current requirements and evaluate effectiveness of current support
   (planning meetings, training/exercise hotwashes, individual requirement meetings, etc.)
   6.4.4. Evaluate support requirements and determine the most efficient/best solution to meet
   validated requirements.
   6.4.5. Provide direct support to command, control, and planning functions.
   6.4.6. Coordinate logistics for movement of personnel and equipment during exercises and
   deployments.
   6.4.7. Provide meteorological parameters, data, and subject matter expertise to installation
   Disaster Response Force elements, EOC Emergency Support Functions (ESF), and any/all
   Installation Emergency Management Plans.
       6.4.7.1. Partner with the Civil Engineering Squadron Readiness Flight (CEXR), Fire
       Emergency Services (CEF), installation Medical Group’s Bioenvironmental Engineering
       Flight, Army Installation Directors of Emergency Services, and National Guard Civil
       Support Teams for ANG weather organizations, as the Weather SME responsible for
       optimizing weather data input to CDMs, EDMs, and CBRN hazard-prediction models
       used by these ESFs for decision assistance in the EOC, CBRN Control Center, and at the
       incident site.
AFI15-128 7 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                       33


           6.4.7.1.1. Weather SME will advise and provide the most accurate and representative
           observed and/or forecast alphanumeric and gridded meteorological data type
           appropriate to a particular CBRN event to users employing ALOHA, CAMEO, and
           CBRN hazard-prediction (i.e., “plume”) models resident in the Joint Warning and
           Reporting Network (JWARN)/Joint Effects Model (JEM)/Joint Operational Effects
           Federation (JOEF) architecture IAW AFI 10-2501, AFMAN 10-2503 and equivalent
           Joint guidance, to ensure consistency between CBRN hazard area predictions and the
           installation forecast.
           6.4.7.1.2. Provide real-time observations as well as forecast alphanumeric and
           gridded model data files used to generate the affected installation’s Terminal
           Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) as the primary weather input to users generating
           automated or manual location-/installation-specific CDMs and EDMs to ensure
           consistency between CBRN hazard area predictions and the installation forecast.
       6.4.7.2. Provide or arrange for delivery of CDMs and EDMs generated from AFWA or
       OWS webpages.
   6.4.8. Provide weather expertise for Instrument Refresher Program briefings upon request.
   See AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Program, for further information.
6.5. Mission Integration Function. Mission integration requires gaining an in-depth
understanding of supported mission platforms, equipment, and systems capabilities/sensitivities
as well as mission processes (e.g., JOPP, MDMP, IPB, ORM, COP, tactics, etc.) to be able to
reliably inject timely, accurate, and relevant environmental information at every decision point in
the mission planning process in an effort to optimize mission execution. To ensure maximum
mission integration, personnel executing the Mission Integration function will:
   6.5.1. Configure personnel/operations in whatever manner maximizes the WF’s ability to
   reliably “inject the right information at the right time every time” into their supported flying
   and non-flying organizations’ mission planning, execution and assessment processes. Note:
   Optimal configurations may or may not require collocation with the supported
   organization(s). Therefore, collocation decisions will be left to the discretion of senior WF
   leadership.
   6.5.2. Establish and actively maintain working relationships with supported organizations’
   key operational decision makers, operators, intelligence specialists, tactical-level mission
   planners, schedulers, and weapons and tactics experts. Once established, WF personnel will
   be able to quickly adapt to process and/or mission changes.
       6.5.2.1. Maintain operational situational awareness through active participation in
       supported customers’ battle rhythms which include, but are not limited to, joint planning
       group(s), threat working group(s), ISR synchronization, mission planning, rehearsals,
       mission execution, and operations updates.
       6.5.2.2. Pass information on operations schedule, sensitivity threshold, or support
       requirement changes to WF/CC or NCOIC.
   6.5.3. Provide operators with the capability to exploit favorable environmental windows of
   opportunity and gain asymmetrical advantage by exercising keen knowledge of
   environmental sensitivity thresholds impacting mission profiles, weapon systems, TTPs,
34                                                           AFI15-128 7 FEBRUARY 2011


  METLs, and other operationally relevant factors across the full spectrum of operations.
  Inject as appropriate throughout the planning, execution, and assessment phases of the
  continuous operations cycle.
     6.5.3.1. Provide environmental estimates based on combat critical environmental
     thresholds to assess feasibility of missions as well as anticipate effectiveness of air and
     ground combat systems, platforms, weapon systems, and munitions.
     6.5.3.2. Focus on mitigation of environmental threats, offering weather-optimized
     alternatives to existing courses of action that will help shape the mission profile and
     increase the likelihood of mission success.
  6.5.4. Provide MWPs as coordinated with supported units, including tenant organizations.
  MWPs include MEFs, IPB products, mission planning products, environmental inputs to
  mission analysis, environmental staff estimates, running environmental staff estimates, and
  any other weather product prepared to meet the needs of a supported unit.
  6.5.5. Use an established, repeatable process to create deliverable MWPs and provide
  decision-quality environmental information for all stages of the planning and execution
  phases of operations. Multiple MWPs may be created to support the needs of different
  mission profiles (air, ground maneuver, fixed sensor, EOC and Civil Engineering CBRN
  Control Center operations, Civil Engineering Fire Emergency Services, etc.).
  6.5.6. Interpret and apply space weather data and forecasts to support applicable unit
  missions. This includes alerting the supported unit to the impacts of space weather on their
  operations, weapons, and communication systems.
  6.5.7. Provide weather input to Tactical Decision Aids as coordinated with the host/parent
  unit. This includes working proactively with the installation CES/CEXR to ensure that the
  most accurate and representative meteorological data type is input correctly into the
  JWARN/JEM/JOEF suite of CBRN models as well as ALOHA and CAMEO to produce
  CBRN Control Center and/or EOC hazard plume decision aids that are consistent with the
  DoD-approved installation forecast (TAF).
  6.5.8. Apply sound ORM practices to processes covering MISSIONWATCH within
  designated areas of operations across the spectrum of air and ground mission profiles and for
  the duration of those missions. This will include:
     6.5.8.1. Developing procedures to determine critical thresholds requiring intensified
     MISSIONWATCH and updating parent/host unit on changes to environmental conditions
     critical to the mission.
     6.5.8.2. Maintaining a MISSIONWATCH tailored to the mission(s) of the day.
     6.5.8.3. Assigning risk, allocating resources and directing activities to conduct
     MISSIONWATCH for parent/host unit missions.
     6.5.8.4. Conducting MISSIONWATCH for critical portions of every mission placed at
     risk due to environmental threats.
     6.5.8.5. Informing the supporting OWS when weather products issued by the OWS do
     not accurately reflect observed conditions, particularly when conditions impact safety of
     flight.
AFI15-128 7 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                      35


6.6. Airfield Support Function. The airfield support function focuses on providing decision
makers and supported organizations with highly perishable, timely, accurate, and relevant
observed environmental information essential to flying and non-flying operations, both in
garrison and at deployed locations. Personnel executing the airfield support function will:
   6.6.1. Use the procedures in AFMAN 15-111 to take, record and disseminate surface
   weather observations at those locations requiring an observation for airfield operations.
   6.6.2. Relay significant, time-sensitive meteorological information (e.g., tactical radar data,
   significant surface observations) to OWS technicians conducting forecast/METWATCH
   operations IAW a locally established duty priority list. Note: This responsibility is still
   required in circumstances where US National Weather Service or a host nation issues the
   aerodrome forecast.
   6.6.3. While deployed, relay (to the supporting OWS) pertinent observations from
   forward/combined operating bases, tactical or fixed radars, upper air soundings, and other
   meteorological information described in the JMO Letter of Instruction, Theater Sensing
   Strategy or local EWXS procedures.
   6.6.4. Coordinate with other weather organizations operating from the same in-garrison or
   deployed location to ensure weather support is consistent and weather functions are not
   duplicated by the other weather organizations.
       6.6.4.1. The WF assigned to the airfield and supporting the host unit is responsible for
       the local surface weather observation and will issue observed weather
       warnings/advisories for the installation as required. If sensing capability exists, the
       supporting OWS may issue and/or cancel observed weather warnings/advisories provided
       it has been coordinated and is documented on the installation data page.
   6.6.5. Issue WWs for forecast phenomena when imminent weather conditions pose a hazard
   to life or property, and immediate coordination with the supporting OWS is not possible.
6.7. Adopted Forms: AF Form 525, Records Disposition Recommendation
     AF Form 1341, Electronic Record Inventory

     AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training

Preparation of the Battlespace (IPB), Operational Risk Management (ORM) process, and
Common Operating Picture (COP).
Battlefield Weather Airman—Air Force Weather 1W0X1 and 15WX personnel assigned to a
conventional Army support weather unit or any weather personnel with either the 1W0X2 or
15WXC AFSC.
Battlefield Weather Squadron—conventional army-support weather squadron.
Habitual Alignment—A documented standing support relationship between two organizations,
or personnel and an organization.
METWATCH—A deliberate process for monitoring the terrestrial weather or space
environment in an area or region. The purpose of a METWATCH is to identify when and where
observed conditions significantly diverge from forecast conditions and determine courses of
action to update or amend a forecast product or group of products and notify designated
agencies.
AFI15-128 7 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                        45


Military Operating Area Forecast—A forecast guidance product that provides the weather or
space environmental conditions for a specific area in which military operations are occurring.
Mission Execution Forecast (MEF)—Mission-tailored environmental information used in the
execution of a mission. MEFs describe the meteorological mission environment and concentrate
on environmental threats given specific operating thresholds. Where possible, courses of action
to mitigate these threats are offered. WFs and WSTs conduct deliberate forecast processes to
develop, deliver, monitor, and amend mission execution forecasts by fusing perishable data with
operational and strategic level weather forecast products.
Mission Integration—The ability to understand mission platforms, equipment, and systems
capabilities/sensitivities as well as mission processes (e.g., JOPP, MDMP, IPB, ORM, COP,
tactics, etc.) and inject the right information at the right time every time, enabling mitigation of
environmental threats as early as possible in the mission planning process, ultimately optimizing
mission execution.
Mission Profile—--describes a mission’s operating platform(s), route, flight level(s), weapons
systems, equipment, target(s), tactics/techniques/procedures (TTPs), and timing.
MISSIONWATCH—A deliberate process of monitoring terrestrial weather or the space
environment for specific mission-limiting environmental factors that may adversely impact
missions in execution. The MISSIONWATCH process is performed by WFs and WSTs and is
intended to identify previously unidentified environmental threats and alert decision-makers at
the operational unit and/or airborne mission commanders, enabling dynamic changes to mission
profiles that may mitigate the environmental threat and optimize the chance of mission success.
Mission Weather Product (MWP)—-Any weather product or group of weather products
generated by a WF or WST that is integrated into the military decision making process. MWPs
may be planning or execution products and are not limited to aviation missions.
Special Weather Statement (SWS)—An OWS notice to supported customers of meteorological
effects which could impact future operations. This notice is for situational awareness purposes
only and does not require action by supported customers.

Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF)—A coded weather bulletin providing forecast
information for an aerodrome complex to facilitate flight planning and command and control.
TAF products are formatted IAW AFMAN 15-124 and amended IAW procedures specified in
AFMAN 15-129.
Weather Advisory—A special weather product to alert an end user of the occurrence of, or
imminent occurrence of weather conditions impacting operations.
Weather Flight (WF)—Weather flights, detachments, and operating locations whose primary
purpose is to facilitate exploitation of the environment through integration at every step of the
operations planning and execution process. The WF may be located with the supported unit on
an Air Force base, Army post, remotely located in another weather unit, or at a deployed
location.
Weather Warning—A special weather product to facilitate resource protection decisions.
Weather Warnings alert designated agencies to the imminent or actual occurrence of weather
conditions of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or property for which the agency must take
immediate protective actions.

Weather Watch—A special weather product to facilitate resource protection decisions. Weather
Watches provide advance notice to designated agencies of the existence of a potential for
weather conditions of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or property for which the agency
should consider taking protective measures.
