Section A—-General

1. Overview. In almost all cases, the host nation has exclusive criminal jurisdiction over
civilian family members of United States Forces and other civilian personnel (including civilian
employees, DoD contractors, etc). Misconduct adversely affects host nation relations, our
community’s quality of life, and negatively reflects on the individual, the family, and the entire
military community. Commanders will ensure that their personnel understand that they are
responsible for the welfare and conduct of all their family members, other household members
and guests. The installation commander for Air Force installations in the KMC is the 86th Airlift
Wing Commander (86 AW/CC). The installation commander is responsible for the general
welfare, morale, and safety of KMC members on Ramstein Air Base and all other Air Force
installations in the KMC. The installation commander and his designees have a number of
4                                                       RAMSTEINABI51-901 13 APRIL 2010


administrative sanctions that may be taken or directed in cases of family member or civilian
misconduct.
2. Employment-Driven Special Provisions. Special provisions apply to civilians and family
members who are employed by the United States Government or its instrumentalities either from
appropriated or non-appropriated funds. Since both US and Local National employees are
entitled to certain specific job protection rights, the installation commander and his designees
must obtain the advice and assistance of the appropriate civilian personnel officer and staff judge
advocate prior to taking any barment action against a civilian employee under this instruction. If
it is deemed appropriate to bar an individual prior to employment issue resolution, an exception
allowing direct travel to and from work may be included in the barment order if appropriate.

Section B—-Explanation of Terms

3. Family Member. Any person who qualifies as a family member under Section I(c), Article I,
NATO Status of Forces Agreement and applicable implementing agreements. This term
includes members of the household and shall be broadly interpreted to cover all family
members/dependents of the sponsor. In addition, ―      family member‖ shall include those family
members eligible to attend Department of Defense Dependent Schools (DoDDS), regardless of
their sponsor’s affiliation with the DoD. (See DoDDS-Europe Student Eligibility Handbook,
sec. 1.9). For the purpose of this instruction, the two family member categories are:
    3.1. Adult - Any family member or civilian 18 years of age or older, or spouse regardless of
    age.
    3.2. Minor - Any family member under the age of 18.
4. Civilian. Any affiliated US citizen, affiliated local national, or affiliated third country
national having access to the US installations of the KMC, or who are entitled to logistical
support, who otherwise does not meet the definition of a family member.
5. Sponsor. Any person assigned to, employed by, or under the supervision or control of the
Department of the Air Force, Department of the Army, Department of Defense Education
Activity (DODEA), other DoD or US agencies, and NATO units that have local designated
commanders, or persons entitled to logistical support from whom family members derive their
status. ―Sponsor‖ also includes a parent of those family members eligible to attend DoDDS,
regardless of the parent’s affiliation with the DoD.
6. Civilian and Family Member Misconduct. The following is defined as civilian and family
member misconduct:
    6.1. Behavior that is contrary to the good order and discipline of the military installation and
    community.
    6.2. Behavior that violates host nation laws.
    6.3. Behavior that violates written rules, regulations/instructions, policies, and directives of
    the DoD, Department of the Army, Department of the Air Force, Commanding General,
    Unites States Army Europe (CGUSAREUR), Commander, United States Air Force Europe
    (COMUSAFE), 21st Theater Sustainment Command, Commanding General (21 TSC/CG),
    United States Army Garrison – Kaiserslautern (USAG-K), and 86 AW/CC. These rules are
RAMSTEINABI51-901 13 APRIL 2010                                                                5


   enforced by the installation commander and designees. (See, e.g. the installation curfew at
   Attachment 8).
   6.4. Behavior that violates DoDDS regulations and policies.
7. Kaiserslautern Military Community (KMC). The KMC is a large geographical area that
has historically included both Air Force and Army facilities including but not limited to the
military facilities: Ramstein AB; Vogelweh US Facilities; Kapaun Air Station; Einsiedlerhof Air
Station; Einsiedlerhof Civil Engineering Complex; Daenner Kaserne; Kleber Kaserne; Panzer
Kaserne; Rhine Ordnance Barracks (ROB); Sembach; Landstuhl Army Regional Medical Center;
Pulaski Barracks; Kaiserslautern Army Depot; Kaiserslautern East Community Facilities;
Kaiserslautern Equipment Maintenance Center; Bann Communications Facilities; Cold Storage
Facility – Ramstein; Defense Property Disposal Office; Langerkopf Communications Site – Hill
365; Weilerbach Storage Area – ROB; and owned or leased US Military Family Housing
connected with the above facilities.

Section C—-Responsibilities

8. Installation Commander. The installation commander is responsible for action taken in
dealing with misconduct cases of any affiliated civilian personnel and others residing in,
authorized use of, or attempting access to US facilities on Ramstein Air Base and all other Air
Force installations in the KMC. Authority for action is hereby delegated to:
   8.1. For Air Force sponsored dependents and employees, the 86th Mission Support Group
   Commander (86 MSG/CC) and 86th Mission Support Group Deputy Commander (86
   MSG/CD), except for barment.
   8.2. For Army sponsored dependents and employees, the Commander USAG-K.
   8.3. This authority may be further delegated by these designees, except in cases involving
   barment.
9. Department of Defense Dependent Schools–Europe Officials (DoDDS-E) (part of the
DoDEA).
   9.1. The DoDDS-E Kaiserslautern District Superintendent of Schools and other school
   administrators have primary responsibility for addressing disciplinary problems that occur on
   school buses, on school grounds during the school day and at school sponsored activities.
   Individual school principals are primarily responsible for sanctioning students who are
   involved in school related misconduct. The principal of a school shall notify the installation
   commander or designee of any acts that may violate local laws or pose a threat to the safety
   or security of the installation. (DoDEA Regulation 2051.1, enclosure 3).
   9.2. Suspension or expulsion from school is the responsibility of DoDEA officials. The
   installation commander’s designee may be a part of the School Disciplinary Committee,
   which investigates whether a family member’s alleged misconduct warrants removal from
   the school for more than 10 consecutive school days (including expulsion). (DoDEA
   Regulation 2051.1, enclosure 5, sec. E5.3.2.3).
   9.3. The installation commander or designee may also take other appropriate corrective
   action against a family member student who has engaged in misconduct.
6                                                      RAMSTEINABI51-901 13 APRIL 2010


10. Commander, First Sergeant and Supervisor Involvement.
    10.1. Designees listed in paragraph 8 will notify the appropriate commander/first
    sergeant/supervisor in instances of civilian or family member misconduct as well as the
    planned action in response to that misconduct. Early involvement of the civilian’s or
    sponsor’s immediate commander/first sergeant/supervisor is essential in ensuring that each
    case is resolved in a fair and impartial manner.
    10.2. The commander/first sergeant/supervisor may counsel a military sponsor for
    inadequately responding to family member misconduct.
11. Sponsor. A sponsor is responsible for the actions of his or her family member(s) and will
provide guidance and ensure appropriate behavior of his or her family member(s). The sponsor
is also responsible for ensuring that both adult and minor family members are aware of the
standards of conduct they are expected to maintain. The sponsor is responsible for cooperating
fully with the installation commander and designee as listed in paragraph 8, school officials, and
host nation officials in their efforts to promote harmony and good order in the community.
These efforts include participation in rehabilitative measures and compliance with administrative
sanctions when directed (e.g., supervision of base beautification detail). A sponsor’s response to
a family member’s misconduct can be considered in determining the appropriate disposition of
the family member’s case.
12. Law Enforcement Authorities. 86th Security Forces (86 SFS), 569th United States Forces
Police Squadron (569 USFPS), Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI), and Army
Criminal Investigation Division (CID), as the primary US law enforcement agencies in the
KMC, will investigate and report civilian and family misconduct and forward resulting report
documents to the appropriate designees listed in paragraph 8. These agencies will also be
prepared to clarify or expand on reported misconduct when tasked by designees above. 86
SFS/Reports and Analysis Section (86 SFS/S5R) and 569 USFPS/Reports and Analysis Section
(569 USFPS/S5R) will maintain the files for civilian and family member misconduct.
13. Staff Judge Advocate Staffs. Army, HQ, 21st Theater Sustainment Command, ATTN:
Army in Europe Regulation Judge Advocate-Admin Law (21 TSC, ATTN: AERJA-AL) and Air
Force, 86th Airlift Wing Staff Judge Advocate (86 AW/JA) staffs will provide legal
reviews/opinions to assist the designees listed above regarding civilian and family member
misconduct. The legal reviews/opinions are for official use only (FOUO) and will not be shown
to those who have been involved in misconduct or to their sponsors.

Section D—-Administrative Sanctions

14. Jurisdiction. Host nation authorities have criminal jurisdiction over civilian family
members and civilian personnel. (See DOD Directive 5525.1, Status of Forces Policies and
Information; AE Regulation 550-50/USAFE Instruction 51-706, Exercise of Foreign Criminal
Jurisdiction Over United States Personnel; AE Regulation 550-56/USAFE Instruction 51-705,
Exercise of Jurisdiction by German Courts and Authorities Over US Personnel; AFI 51-703,
Foreign Criminal Jurisdiction. In appropriate cases, the installation commander may request
jurisdiction of any case against civilian family members and personnel from the German
authorities. The installation commander or designee also has a number of administrative
RAMSTEINABI51-901 13 APRIL 2010                                                                7


sanctions that may be taken or directed in cases of family member and civilian misconduct,
either instead of or in conjunction with host nation action
15. Relation of Installation Commander and Employer Sanctions. In the case of civilian
personnel, any action taken by the installation commander or designee is in addition to any
adverse personnel action that may be taken against the employee for off-duty misconduct that
relates to the employee’s performance of official duties. (AFI 36-704, Discipline and Adverse
Actions; AFI 34-301, Nonappropriated Fund Personnel Management and Administration;
USAFE Instruction 36-702, Conduct and Discipline, Non-US Citizen Employees, Germany. See
also AE Regulation 27-9, para 14 (a), Misconduct by Civilians).
16. Principles Affecting Sanction Selection. When selecting administrative sanctions, the
following principles apply:
   16.1. Misconduct should be evaluated in light of the individual’s age, prior record,
   connection to the installation, seriousness of misconduct, deliberateness of misconduct,
   defiance of authority, discourteous conduct, influencing others’ involvement in misconduct,
   the presence or absence of parental guidance and discipline, the availability of community
   agencies to support any corrective actions, sanctions used in like cases, adverse impact upon
   the Air Force/Army, culpable involvement with German law enforcement authorities,
   circumstances and the effect misconduct has had on victim(s), and rehabilitative potential of
   sanction. (See, e.g., AE Regulation 27-9, para. 11).
   16.2. The following favorable factors may justify less severe administrative sanctions:
   possibility of genuine misunderstanding, enticements or provocations, length of service to the
   community, quality of work history, personal reputation, past contributions, whether
   restitution has been made to the victim, record of cooperativeness, and record of
   achievements. (See, e.g., AE Regulation 27-9, para. 11(e); USAFE Instruction 36-702,
   attachment 2, para. A2.3.3; Attachment 7).
   16.3. The selected sanction must bear a rational relationship to the offense committed. For
   example, the suspension of driving privileges may be an appropriate sanction for misconduct
   involving a privately owned vehicle, but not for shoplifting at the Commissary or Army and
   Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES). (See AE Regulation 27-9, para. 11(b); AE
   Regulation 550-50/USAFE Instruction 51-706, para. 13(b)(1)).
17. Sanction Descriptions. The installation commander or designee may take any one or more
of the following administrative sanctions. (See, e.g., AE Regulation 27-9, para. 12 and appendix
D, table D-1, ―Table of Suggested Penalties‖).
   17.1. Verbal Counseling: The civilian may be counseled about his own alleged misconduct,
   and the sponsor may be counseled about the alleged misconduct of his family member. The
   sponsor also may be notified of unproven allegations of misconduct of his family member,
   where reason for concern exists. (AE Regulation 27-9, para. 12(a); Attachment 2).
   17.2. Letter of Warning: The civilian may be issued a letter of warning based upon his own
   misconduct, and the sponsor may be issued a letter of warning based upon his family
   member’s misconduct. In cases involving civilian personnel, the letter of warning will be
   sent through the civilian employee’s servicing civilian personnel office/Human Relations
   Office Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) employees), or, in cases involving contractors, through
   the contracting officer (or representative). (AE Regulation 27-9, para. 12(a); Attachment 3).

    17.3. Restriction of Travel: While on KMC installations, the family member may be
    restricted in freedom of travel. A parent or legal guardian must accompany the minor family
    member at all times, except when the family member is proceeding directly to and from
    medical facilities for necessary medical care, or when the family member is at school, at
    work, or at on-base quarters. (Attachment 4).
    17.4. Referral to Counseling: The civilian, family member, and/or sponsor may be requested
    to seek counseling from the chaplain, Life Skills Center, or other base services. The designee
    may consider any failure to attend such counseling in deciding whether more serious
    sanctions should be imposed. (Attachment 5).
    17.5. Barment by the installation commander of civilians and family members from all KMC
    installations (including DoDDS), except for entrance to obtain authorized necessary medical
    care. AFI 31-101, para 8.9, Air Force Installation Security Program. Barment is one of the
    most serious sanctions the installation commander may impose, and pursuant to the
    interservice memorandum of agreement for Installation Bars, effective 26 April 2002, this
    action will also bar entry to all facilities under the operational control of the U.S. Armed
    Forces in Europe. The barment procedures are detailed in Attachment 10.
    17.6. Suspension or revocation of a civilian’s or family member’s logistical support, such as
    MWR activities, Commissary, AAFES, and ration privileges on KMC military facilities. The
    installation commander or designee may also take away privileges of entry into any, some, or
    all KMC retail outlet facility/facilities to include snack bars, cafeterias, etc. The installation
    commander or designee may direct that the civilian’s or family member’s military
    identification card be confiscated and reissued, showing such limited benefits and privileges.
    (AR 600-8-14/AFI 36-3026(I), para 1.15, Identification Cards for Members Of The
    Uniformed Services, Their Eligible Family Members, And Other Eligible Personnel; AE
    215-8/AFI 34-211(I), para 6.6, Army and Air Force Exchange Service Operations; AE
    Regulation 600-702/USAFE Instruction 34-101, para 12(a), Staff Instruction/Ration Policy;
    AE Regulation 600-1; Regulated Activities in Europe; see DODI 1330.17, Attachment 6,
    Armed Services Commissary Operations).               Revocation of privileges is particularly
    appropriate when the misconduct is related to the abuse of such privileges. Abuse of
    privilege can include, but is not limited to:
    17.6.1.   Purchasing items for resale purposes, or transferring or exchanging items to
    unauthorized patrons.
    17.6.2. Purchasing goods to conduct a private business or otherwise produce income.
       17.6.3. Shoplifting or intentionally or repeatedly presenting dishonored checks. (Note:
       Shoplifting from AAFES or intentional presentation of dishonored checks results in a
       mandatory 6 month suspension of privileges). (AR 215-8/AFI 34-211(I), para. 6-6; EOP
       16-1).
    17.7. Suspension or revocation of a civilian’s or family member’s driving privileges IAW
    AFI 31-204, AR 190-5/AFI 31-218(I) para. 2-4, and 86 AW Instruction 31-201. A civilian
    or family member may also be declared ineligible for a license according to AE Regulation
    190-1/USAFE Instruction 31-202, para. 1-4(b)(7). All correspondence involving such action
    will be prepared by 86 SFS/Reports and Analysis Section and 569 USFPS/Reports and
    Analysis Section.
RAMSTEINABI51-901 13 APRIL 2010                                                                 9


  17.8. Termination of family housing with 30 days’ notice when the sponsor or family
  member’s conduct or behavior is contrary to accepted standards or adverse to military
  discipline. (AFI 32-6001, paras 6.3.6, 6.3.7, Family Housing Management, and USAFE
  Supplement).
  17.9. Early Return of Family Member. Pursuant to the Joint Federal Travel Regulations
  (JFTR), volume 1, para. U5900-D(2)(e)(military sponsors) and the Joint Travel Regulations,
  volume II, para. C7003-D (civilian sponsors), commanders will consider the early return of
  family members or other civilian offenders to Continental Unites States (CONUS) when
  other administrative measures are not expected to be effective. (SeeAE Regulation 27-9,
  para 12(f); Misconduct by Civilians; see also AFI 36-3020; see also AFI 36-3020, Family
  Member Travel. Measures pertaining to returning family members to CONUS include the
  following:
     17.9.1. Commanders may encourage the sponsor (military or civilian) to request the
     early return of the family member to CONUS. An early return of a military dependent
     pursuant to JFTR vol 1, para. U5900-D(2)(e) and JTR vol 2, para. C7003-D will be
     considered to be in the best interest of the government.
     17.9.2. Even in the absence of a military sponsor’s voluntary request for the early return
     of his family member, command sponsored dependents of military personnel may be
     provided Early Return of Dependent (ERD) orders in those cases when the
     dependent/family member engages in behavior which is embarrassing to the U.S.
     government, which is prejudicial to order, morale, and discipline in the command, or
     which gives rise to conditions in which the dependent’s safety can no longer be ensured.
     (JFTR, vol. 1, para. U5900-B).
     17.9.3. There is no correlating involuntary return of family members of civilians under
     the Joint Travel Regulations. (See AE Regulation 27-9, para. 12(f)(2), citing Comptroller
     General Opinion B-183205, May 15, 1975).
  17.10. Assignment Curtailment – Military Sponsor. A military member’s overseas
  assignment may be curtailed due to certain instances of family member misconduct, when the
  misconduct has resulted, or could result, in significant adverse publicity to the United States.
  Assignment curtailment is to be used as a last resort, and usually the early return of the
  dependent without curtailment of the sponsor’s assignment is appropriate. (AFI 36 -2110,
  para. 3.8.10, Assignments).
  17.11. Assignment Curtailment – Civilian Sponsor. Any action similar to an assignment
  curtailment for a civilian employee should be routed through the Civilian Personnel Office
  and 86 AW/JA, and processed IAW 5 CFR 352 and 5 CFR 752. (See AE Regulation 27-9,
  para. 12(g)). Actions against contractor personnel should be routed through the contracting
  officer (or his representative) and 86 AW/JA.
  17.12. Other Action. When a sponsor refuses to request the early return of his family
  member, or when an early return is authorized and the family member refuses to leave (or
  leaves and returns), the installation commander may bar the family member from the base
  (other than for authorized medical care), and may terminate family housing in appropriate
  cases. (AFI 31-101, para. 8.9, The Air Force Installation Security Program; AFI 32-6001,
  paras. 6.3.6, 6.3.7., Family Housing Management, and USAFE Supplement; See AE
10                                                     RAMSTEINABI51-901 13 APRIL 2010


     Regulation 27-9, para. 12(f)(4), Misconduct by Civilians). As long as the sponsor remains in
     the command, the family member retains his/her status under the NATO Status of Forces
     Agreement.
18. Administrative Hold for Pending Criminal Charges. Family members and civilians
facing pending German criminal charges (other than minor traffic incidents) will not be allowed
to leave Germany for any reason without coordination with the local legal liaison authorities and
the approval of the United States Army Europe, Army Europe Office of the Staff Judge Adovate,
International Law Division, Foreign Law Section, USAREUR/JA (AEAJA-IL-FL). (AE
Regulation 550-56/USAFE Instruction 51-705 para. 4(b)(1), Exercise of Jurisdiction by German
Courts and Authorities Over US Personnel).
19. Methods to Mitigate Sanctions: Offenders may be offered the option of voluntarily
participating in community service such as the base beautification detail program, which may
result in a reduction of punitive action. Individuals age 17 and under must be supervised by the
sponsor/parent while volunteering in said program. 86th Civil Engineer Group (86 CEG) 86
CEG has the overall supervision for the base beautification detail program. Completion of base
beautification detail hours must be documented by the Base Beautification Detail POC.
Offenders may also try to mitigate their punishment by voluntarily participating in counseling
(e.g., anger-management training, alcohol or substance abuse programs, parenting skills
training). (Attachment 5). Additionally, offenders may agree to random drug testing when
misconduct involves substance abuse.

Section E—-Procedures.

20. Report and Investigation. Anyone may report serious civilian or family member
misconduct incidents to the applicable law enforcement authorities. School, transportation, or
youth activities officials may handle minor incidents. Law enforcement authorities will conduct
all required investigations and will send completed civilian and family member misconduct
investigative reports, with the exception of Air Force driving privilege cases and other traffic-
related cases, to the installation commander or designee.
21. Sanction Determination and Initial Notification. The designee’s staff will review the
report and may forward the file to the appropriate staff judge advocate office for a legal
review/opinion. If there are no legal issues, the civilian or family member, along with their
sponsor, will meet with the applicable designee’s staff to discuss rehabilitative measures and/or
the imposition of administrative sanctions. Administrative sanctions will be in writing and will
be personally served. The civilian or family member and sponsor will sign and date the writing,
acknowledging receipt and understanding of the sanctions. The written sanction should include
the who, what, when, where, and how of the incident, as well as any prior offenses. If the
sanction cannot be personally served, the sanction will be sent to the civilian’s or family member
and sponsor’s most recent address by certified return receipt mail.
22. Driving-Related Incidents. With regard to driving privileges, 86 SFS and 569 USFPS will
forward reports and/or requests for restricted driving regarding Air Force personnel and family
members, along with action letters for the designee’s signature, directly to 86 AW/JA, rather
than to the Air Force designee’s office. After a legal review is completed, the file will be
forwarded to the designee’s office. Security Forces will forward Army related driving privilege
RAMSTEINABI51-901 13 APRIL 2010                                                                 11


reports and restricted driving requests, along with action letters for the designee’s signature,
directly to the Army designee’s office.
23. Barment Actions. Barment actions will be processed as described in Attachment 10.
24. After-Action Notification. Whenever an administrative sanction has been imposed on a
family member, the sponsor and the sponsor’s immediate commander or first sergeant will be
notified, as well as other agencies to make the sanctions effective.
   24.1. In addition, if an administrative sanction is taken against a civilian, the employee’s
   commander or supervisor will evaluate whether or not the offender has or requires a security
   clearance and will immediately report the adverse administrative sanctions to appropriate
   security-clearance-review authorities. (See, e.g., AE Regulation 27-9 para. (10)(d)(1),
   Misconduct by Civilians).
   24.2. Appropriate DoD hiring authorities will be notified of incidents involving civilians or
   family members when such incidents reflect upon employment qualifications. Civilian
   personnel offices and selecting supervisors can use this information in determining if said
   individual is suitable for employment. (See, e.g., AE Regulation 27-9 para. 12 (c),
   Misconduct by Civilians).

Section F—-Appeal.

25. Barments. Appeals of barments will be processed as described in Attachment 10.
26. Administrative Sanctions. If the civilian or family member and sponsor have new, relevant
information proving innocence, showing mitigating circumstances, or personal/family hardship
not considered in the initial action, they may submit an appeal for reconsideration to the
appropriate designee within 3 work days of the imposition of adverse action (unless a different
appeal time is given by an appropriate instruction, see AE Regulation 600-702/USAFE
Instruction 34-101, para. 12(a)(2)(b)(time to appeal ration privilege revocation is 10 work days)).
Exceptions to the 3-day deadline may be granted by the designee for good cause. Traffic
sanctions appeals must be submitted through the respective Security Forces Reports and Analysis
section.

27. Adopted Forms.

MEMORANDUM FOR SPONSOR


FROM: Designee
SUBJECT: Awareness Letter


1. According to a security forces report dated (date) your son/daughter, (name), may have
been involved in (type of incident at (location)). While it is not certain that this allegation is
true, I consider it important that you be made aware of the fact that he has been mentioned in
connection with this matter.
2. Under the terms of NATO Status of Forces Agreement, German authorities have
exclusive criminal jurisdiction over our civilian members. In order to assure these authorities
that positive action is taken in all cases of misconduct, as well as to ensure that our military
community is a pleasant place in which to live, I have been charged with the responsibility to
investigate incidents and implement the appropriate corrective action.
3. I must repeat that there is no firm evidence to support your son’s/daughter’s involvement.
My only intent is to share information with you which has been brought to my attention. I
feel this is necessary because as a sponsor you have a right to know, and because you are in a
better position to influence him/her than anyone else.
4. If I or any member of my staff may be of help in this or any similar matter, please feel
free to call.

SUBJECT: Corrective Action for Shoplifting Letter
1. According to a security forces report your (son/daughter/spouse), (name), was involved in an
incident of shoplifting at (location) on (date). Incidents of this nature are considered serious. All
civilians accompanying US Forces in Germany fall under the jurisdiction of German authorities;

86th Military Personnel Flight (MPF) to receive an application for a new ID card, which will reflect
the withdrawal of these privileges. I trust you will impress upon your family member the seriousness
of this misconduct and that there will be no recurrence. Violation of this restriction may result in
permanent revocation of your family member’s privileges. Upon completion of the endorsement of
this letter by the MPF you will return it to this office within 24 hours.
3. [In cases not involving AAFES shoplifting] You have the option of your family member
completing (number) hours of parentally supervised community service with the Base Beautification
Detail. If you select this option and have met the requirement, in (number) months, you may request,
in writing, reconsideration of the above suspension order. Requests must be sent to the designee’s

The following states the installation commander’s policy on curfew:

2. Violators will be cited and escorted to either the Ramstein Law Enforcement Desk or the
U.S. Forces Police Station in Vogelweh, as appropriate. Parents of violators will be notified
and required to accept custody of their children at the above designated locations. All
members are responsible for enforcement of this policy.
3. The installation commander may implement additional curfew hours when conditions and
circumstances warrant.

                                  86 AW BARMENT POLICY

A10.1. Installation commanders have wide authority to exclude persons from their installation
and other areas of command. DoD Directive 5200.8, para. 3(2); AFI 31-101, paras. 1.7, 8.9.
Barment is one of the most serious sanctions the installation commander may impose.
A10.2. When the family member or civilian misconduct is considered egregious enough to
warrant barment, law enforcement personnel will always forward the file to the appropriate staff
judge advocate office for review/opinion prior to the designee’s meeting with the civilian or
family member and sponsor.
A10.3. The staff judge advocate will make a legal review, as to the propriety of barment. If the
designee agrees with the staff judge advocate’s recommendation to bar, he will sign a notice of
barment letter which is then served on the civilian or family member and sponsor. Prior to
signing the barment notice, the Air Force designee must coordinate the barment action with the
installation commander. The letter must give specific reasons for barment. The civilian or
family member and sponsor will sign and date the letter acknowledging receipt and
understanding. If the notice cannot be personally served, it will be sent to the civilian or family
member and sponsor’s most recent address by certified return receipt mail. (Attachment 11).
A10.4. The individual who receives a notice of proposed barment has 3 work days to review
documents regarding the barment action. In the case of AFOSI Reports of Investigation (ROI),
extracts/summaries may be reviewed. This information is temporarily kept at the designee’s
office and can be viewed or obtained by submitting a written request for the evidence. The
civilian or family member and sponsor may submit written matters in response to the proposed
barment. The civilian or family member and sponsor may also request a personal appearance,
which may be granted as the designee’s calendar permits. The designee will summarize in
writing his/her impressions and the facts presented at this informal hearing. For good cause, the
designee may grant a time extension.
A10.5. Once 3 work days have passed or the individual has submitted written material and/or
made a personal presentation, the file may be referred back to the staff judge advocate’s office
for a more detailed legal review. If the installation commander finds barment appropriate, he/she
will sign the barment order.
A10.6. Oral barment orders (including immediate barment orders) by the installation
commander are possible, but should be given only when time constraints prevent preparing a
written order. Oral barment orders must be immediately followed-up in writing. AFI 31-101,
para. 8.9.1. The authority to bar individuals from the installation may not be delegated. AFI 31 -
101, para. 8.9.
A10.7. The designee’s staff will serve the barment order on the civilian or family member and
sponsor. They will sign and date the barment order, acknowledging receipt and understanding.
If personal service is not possible, the barment order will be sent to the civilian or family
member and sponsor’s most recent address by certified return receipt mail. AFI 31-101, para.
8.9.1.2. The designee’s staff will then return the file, which contains the investigative report and
original action letter to the respective Security Forces Reports and Analysis Section. All
investigative reports on barment actions will be maintained throughout the barment period. AFI
RAMSTEINABI51-901 13 APRIL 2010                                                                     25


31-101, para. 8.9. Security Forces maintain a list of personnel barred from the installation. All
lists are for official use only (FOUO). AFI 31-101, para. 8.9.2.
A10.8. The standard barment time should be one year. Longer barment periods are
appropriate in cases of egregious misconduct or when the offender has engaged in prior
misconduct. The barment letter should contain some or all of the following information: An
order for the individual not to reenter KMC facilities; the reason for the barment, which should
include the who, what, when, where, and how of the incident or conduct giving rise to the
barment;     why the incident            or     conduct is wrong;            citation to violated
regulations/instructions/statutes, for the latest as well as for prior offenses; any limitations of the
bar order (medical care or travel to and from work); appeal procedure; the barment’s length of
time; notice of Section 123(1) of the German Criminal Code and its provisions; and a statement
the individual is subject to apprehension and detainment by Security Forces for prompt delivery
to appropriate civil authorities upon reentry in violation of the barment order; and notice that
pursuant to the interservice memorandum of agreement for Installation Bars, effective 26 April
2002, a barment to KMC facilities will also bar entry to all facilities under the operational
control of the U.S. Armed Forces in Europe.
A10.9. In a case of extreme misconduct, the installation commander can authorize an immediate
barment of a command-affiliated individual. Review of this action will be conducted as soon as
all pertinent information has been compiled.

MEMORANDUM FOR SPONSOR
FROM: 86 AW/CC (or USAG-K/GC if Army civilian/dependent)
SUBJECT: Order Not to Enter or Reenter Military Facilities
1. According to a security forces (OSI) report dated (date), your (son/daughter/spouse),
(name), was involved in (type of misconduct), at (location) on (date).
2. As a result of this incident of misconduct, I consider your family member’s presence on
Ramstein Air Base and all other Air Force installations in the Kaiserslautern Military
Community (KMC) to be detrimental to the maintenance of good order and discipline.
Effective immediately, (he/she) is ordered not to enter the limits of the KMC for the period
of one year. Pursuant to the interservice memorandum of agreement for Installation Bars,
effective 26 April 2002, this action will bar (his/her) entry to all facilities under the
operational control of the U.S. Armed Forces in Europe.
3. However, if your family member is entitled to medical treatment at a military medical
facility, your family member may enter a military installation for the sole purpose of using
said facility. To so, your family member must present this letter to the entry controller at the
installation entry point and obtain the appropriate visitor pass. Your family member will
travel directly to the medical facility for treatment and must leave the installation
immediately following medical treatment. Your family member shall not deviate from the
most direct route to the medical facility, nor shall (he/she) stop for any reason on (his/her)
way to or from the facility.
4. If your family member fails to comply with this order, (he/she) will be subject to
prosecution under Section 123(1) of the German Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch), translated
in Army in Europe Pamphlet 550-19, Appendix A, which states ―       Whoever unlawfully
invades the dwelling, the business premises, the fenced-in property of another, or the
enclosed premises that are assigned to public services or traffic, will be punished by
imprisonment not exceeding one year or by a fine.‖
5. Should your family member enter any U.S. military installations in Europe in violation of
this order, without having received prior approval by an authorized commander, (he/she) will
be subject to detention by security forces for delivery to the appropriate civilian authorities.
6. Under extraordinary circumstances, requests for temporary access to other facilities on
military installations of the KMC may be granted. Such requests should be made in advance
and in writing through the 86 MSG/CD, and set out the reason(s) why access should be
granted. If time does not permit, such a request must be made to the security forces control
center at 06371-47-2050. The controller will then notify the appropriate officials and convey
your family member’s request.

7. This order will remain in effect for the period prescribed in paragraph 2 unless otherwise
revoked in writing by myself. If a compelling reason exists which you or your family
member believe should be sufficient to justify modification or termination of this order, you
or your family member may submit your justification to me, in writing, through the 86
MSG/CD.
