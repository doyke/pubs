MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION C

FROM: HQ USAF/A3/5

SUBJECT: AFI 11-2C-130J Volume 1, C-130J Aircrew Training, Guidance Memorandum.

1. By order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this Guidance Memorandum implements changes to AFI
11-2C-130J Volume 1, C-130J Flying Training, providing clarification to Modular Airborne Fire Fighting
System (MAFFS) continuation training requirements for C-130J aircrew members. Compliance with this
memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its directions are inconsistent with other Air Force
publications, the information herein prevails, IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.

2. Make changes to the following paragraphs:

Page 59. Change to read:

5.13. Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System (MAFFS). The MAFFS mission is performed jointly
by ANG, AFRC, associated Active Duty Total Force Integration (TFI) units and US Forest Service
(USFS) personnel. The USFS serves as the lead federal agency in this partnership. This section
establishes initial and continuation training requirements for a MAFFS-certified C-130J crewmember.
MAFFS Instructor certification guidance is also included. OG/CCs of MAFFS Wings may provide
additional guidance or clarification in local training procedures. However, this guidance will not change
or modify the MAFFS training program outside of the waiver authority listed within this section or the
MAFFS training syllabus. Changes to MAFFS training guidance will be approved by AMC/A3T in
coordination with NGB/A3M and AFRC/A3T to ensure training continuity within the MAFFS Wings.

5.13.1.1. Proposed MAFFS syllabus changes and updates by any MAJCOM/A3 designated MAFFS
Wing will be forwarded to appropriate MAJCOM/A3T for coordination. NGB/A3M and AFRC/A3T will
forward AMC/A3T syllabus updates or change requests to AMC/A3T for consideration, coordination and
final approval. AMC/A3T will maintain the master files and approve syllabus changes and updates upon
receipt of coordination from NGB/A3M and AFRC/A3T. Final syllabus approval authority is AMC/A3
in coordination with NGB/A3 and AFRC/A3.

5.13.1.2. Conduct MAFFS Certification for pilots and loadmasters IAW the approved training syllabus.
Upon completion of training, as detailed in this instruction and the syllabus, crewmembers will be
certified for MAFFS missions. Because C-130J mission qualified crewmembers are already evaluated on
visual low-level and airdrop operations IAW AFI 11-2C-130JV2, additional flight evaluations are not
required to certify MAFFS aircrew.

5.13.2. Authority for MAFFS Certification and waivers for continuation training. Crewmembers will be
selected for MAFFS training via the semi-annual TRP process. The OG/CC will use the Review and
Certification (R&C) process to validate training and certify crewmembers for MAFFS operations
annually. The OG/CC is the waiver authority for MAFFS aircrew continuation training requirements
IAW paragraph 5.13.7.
5.13.3. Time Period for Mission Certification Training. MAFFS initial certification and continuation
training is conducted on an annual basis in coordination with the USFS. Due to the challenge of
scheduling a training event of this nature, there is no specified training time limit. However, MAFFS
training generally occurs NLT 31 May of each year.

5.13.4. MAFFS Training Prerequisites. For all crew positions, crewmembers will be highly experienced,
airdrop qualified C-130 Mission Ready crewmembers. Pilots will be formation and visual low level
qualified. Crewmembers must be available to complete the required training and respond to mission
tasking during the wildfire season. Aircrew will be designated by the OG/CC for course entry. Table
5.3A requirements will be met for MAFFS initial certification or upgrades. OG/CC is designated waiver
authority for any MAFFS Certification/Upgrade prerequisites listed (i.e. flying hours, actual fire drops,
seasons, etc.) and may dictate additional requirements beyond minimums set forth in Table 5.3A.
However, only one prerequisite may be waived by the OG/CC. If waiver authority is exercised, OG/CC
will notify MAJCOM/A3T who will in turn notify AMC/A3T. Waiver authority should be used
judiciously, by exception and for mission accomplishment purposes. MAJCOM/A3 is approval authority
for the waiver of multiple prerequisites. Requesting OG/CC will forward requests to MAJCOM/A3T for
coordination and approval. MAJCOM/A3T will notify AMC/A3T of any MAJCOM/A3 waiver.

 NOTES:
 1. Total flying hours will not include simulator and other time. C-130J flying hours must be in like
 crew postion . Crossflow pilots may include flight time from other military aircraft. OG/CC may
 approve up to 500 C-130E/H hours toward the C-130J hour requirements for cross-flow pilots and
 loadmasters.
 2. Actual fire drops can include multiple incremental drops during one sortie. However, OG/CCâ€™s will
 ensure crewmembers have a variety of actual fire drop experience (flat land, high altitude, steep terrain,
 full load drops, incremental drops, multiple incidents, etc).
 3. Cumlative total since initial MAFFS cerification. A season is experience gained between annual
 continuation training cycles. For example, if a Wing conducted training 6-10 May each year, the season
 would be defined as 11 May through 5 May. The season may be more or less than a year in length
 dependent on when training dates fall throughout the year.
 4. Cumlative total since initial MAFFS cerification. A deployment is experience gained through
 deploying, preferrably performing actual fire drops during, and re-deploying during any one season.
 5. Must be an Instructor in respective crew position. Pilots and Loadmasters will have 100 instructor
 hours.
 6. Total number of actual fire drops in current crew position. For example, to upgrade to MAFFS IP a
 total number of 30 drops as an MAFFS AC is required.

5.13.5. MAFFS Initial Training. Accomplish ground and flight training under the supervision of a
MAFFS instructor. All training will be conducted IAW the approved MAFFS Syllabus during the USFS-
coordinated training session. Upon successful completion of all required training items, instructors will
nominate the crewmember for certification. Once certified by the Sq/CC, crewmembers will be
authorized to perform MAFFS mission duties in their crew position. If crew management allows during
an activation, initial certified MAFFS Copilots and Aircraft Commanders should fly their first actual fire
drops in their respective crew position under direct supervision of a MAFFS Instructor Pilot.

5.13.5.1. MAFFS Instructors. MAFFS instructor candidates will be selected from among the most
qualified MAFFS crewmembers and will be experienced in all phases of MAFFS flying operations,
including actual wildfire airdrops. Prior to MAFFS Instructor training, candidates will complete MAFFS
continuation training to certify for the season. MAFFS instructor candidates will conduct training that
will include ground and flight certification requirements under the supervision of a MAFFS instructor. At
a minimum, instructor upgrades will instruct at least one block of ground training from Table 5.3B and
provide flight instruction during MAFFS annual continuation and initial/upgrade training sorties. Drops
will include fully loaded drops, incremental drops, fully loaded system go around, and should include
exposure to outlying air tanker base operations. MAFFS Instructor Pilot upgrades will demonstrate the
ability to teach from both seats. OG/CCs may provide additional guidance and specific requirements for
instructor certification.

Page 60. Change to read:

5.13.6. Continuation Training. This section outlines ground and flying continuation training
requirements for MAFFS-certified crewmembers. A certified MAFFS Instructor will supervise all ground
continuation training. To reinforce positive training, MAFFS Instructors should fly on continuation
training sorties. IAW paragraph 5.13.8.1.2, all crewmembers will be current for airdrop, pilots will be
current in visual low-level and visual formation. MAFFS continuation training will be accomplished
during an annually scheduled training session conducted by the individual operational MAFFS Wing or in
coordination with USFS at their biennially provided training event. The USFS will provide a lead plane
for annual MAFFS flight training and will provide required ground training a minimum of biennially. If
individuals are unable to attend training during the time specified for their Wing, they may attend training
at an alternate MAFFS Wing location where training is being offered. If a crewmember does not attend a
training session, they are considered NMR for MAFFS missions and may regain MAFFS MR status as
directed by paragraph 5.13.7. If a crewmember loses airdrop qualification, they will also lose MAFFS
certification until qualification is regained. In addition, if pilots lose formation or visual low level
qualification, they will also lose MAFFS certification until qualification is regained.

5.13.6.1. USFS Certification. MAFFS Sq/CCs or OG/CCs will certify individual crewmember
qualifications to the USFS upon successful completion of all required training items.

5.13.6.2. Continuation Training Requirements. MAFFS currency duration shall be based on the annual
MAFFS training program. Due to the frequently changing available training opportunities and dates
throughout the training year, ARMS is not ideally suited to track MAFFS ground or flying continuation
training events on a semiannual basis. Therefore, Wing ARMS personnel will establish a MAFFS
program code (AM) on an annual training cycle. Training accomplishment will also be documented IAW
paragraph 5.13.6.1.

5.13.6.3. Ground Training. Accomplish ground training IAW Table 5.3B. Changes to approved
courseware will be published by AMC/A3T no later than 1 March of each year.
5.13.6.4. Flight Training. Accomplish annual flying training IAW Table 5.4. To credit flying
continuation training requirements, MAFFS training drops will be under the supervision of a USFS or
other agency provided lead plane as directed AFI 11-2C-130JV3, Addenda B.

NOTES:
Requirements may be accomplished during one sortie unless the MAFFS IP determines additional
continuation training is required.
1. MD51 events can be credited by accomplishing MAFFS wet or dry drops
2. Fully loaded system required. Will simulate one MAFFS heavy weight go around and one MAFFS
Emergency Escape Procedure. Actual emergency dumping of load is not required.
3. Actual fire drops are not required to maintain certification, but will be tracked to reflect MAFFS
experience.
4. Pilot requirement only. Used for tracking purposes, specific volume of events not required.

5.13.7. Failure to Complete MAFFS Training Requirements.

5.13.7.1. MAFFS crewmembers normally regain MAFFS currency by completing the annually scheduled
training session conducted by the individual operational MAFFS Wing or in coordination with USFS at
their biennially provided training event. Every attempt will be made to ensure each MAFFS crewmember
is fully qualified and MR IAW paragraph 5.13.8 while performing actual MAFFS missions. Flying in
supervised status with an instructor should be used for operational necessity only. Declare individuals
NMR for MAFFS missions if they fail to complete annual continuation ground or flying training
requirements. The following guidance applies.

Page 62. Add:

5.13.7.2. Failure to Complete MAFFS Ground Training Events. Failure to complete Ground
Continuation training events in Table 5.3B leads to MAFFS NMR status. This NMR status prohibits an
individual from accomplishing MAFFS in-flight duties until the delinquent event is accomplished. If an
individual does not attend the annual training session, ground training will be accomplished by a MAFFS
Instructor prior to flying actual MAFFS missions. For events FS 55-58, which are provided by the USFS,
crewmembers may elect to attend training at an alternate MAFFS Wing location where this training is
being offered. Otherwise, the individual may receive training from a MAFFS Instructor using USFS
provided courseware.

5.13.7.3. Failure to Complete MAFFS Flying Training Events. At the end of the annual MAFFS training
session, the Sq/CC will review ARMS products for crewmembers that fail to accomplish all MAFFS
continuation flying training requirements as directed in Table 5.4. Failure to complete these requirements
prohibits an individual from accomplishing unsupervised MAFFS in-flight duties. If a crewmember does
not complete annual flying continuation training as directed by Table 5.4, they may regain currency on a
wildfire activation. Training will be coordinated with the Provisional Expeditionary Aerospace
Squadron-Mission Commander (EAS-WFF(P)/MC) who in turn will notify the USFS MAFFS Liaison
Officer (MLO). In some cases, the USFS may be able to provide a lead plane to conduct training by
accomplishing water drops over designated jettison areas. If this is not feasible, individuals may regain
currency over an actual fire under supervision of a MAFFS Instructor of like crew position. In no case
will more than one crew position receive currency training on a MAFFS actual fire sortie. Crew
complement for actual MAFFS missions may not include additional crewmembers not specifically
required for the MAFFS mission.

5.13.7.3.1. Pilot and Loadmaster Requirements to regain MAFFS flying currency. If a pilot or
loadmaster does not complete annual flying continuation training as directed by Table 5.4, they may
regain currency on a wildfire activation. However, the individual will be under direct supervision of a
MAFFS instructor of like crew position and the currency training will be approved by the AEG-WFF/CC
(Federal Activations) or the appropriate OG/CC (State Activations). Actual fire drops will be logged as
MD54 events. In no case will the total number of actual fire drops to regain currency be less than the
MD52 event requirement. MD53 requirements will be met by conducting the event prior to entering the
Fire Traffic Area (FTA) and prior to joining on the lead plane, at a minimum of 1,000â€™ AGL and IAW
AFI 11-2C-130JV3, Addenda B. Direct supervision is required until the instructor determines the
crewmember can safely perform their duties without supervision. As determined by the instructor,
additional sorties or actual fire drops may be required. If an individual misses two consecutive annual
MAFFS training sessions, that individual will lose MAFFS certification and must complete MAFFS
recertification IAW the MAFFS Syllabus.

5.13.8. MAFFS crewmembers NMR for ground and flying training events.

5.13.8.1. MAFFS missions require all crewmembers to be airdrop qualified. Pilots will be visual
formation and low level qualified. In addition to guidance listed in Table 4.7, NMR Flying Restrictions,
crewmembers have the following separate guidance for maintaining mission ready status for MAFFS
mission.
5.13.8.1.1. NMR for Ground training events. With the exception of mandatory grounding items,
crewmembers NMR for ground training events in Table 4.1 may fly unsupervised on MAFFS missions as
long as the crewmembers do not accomplish the specific event(s) that put them into NMR training status.
OG/CC approval is required for MAFFS missions IAW Table 4.1, Note 8.

5.13.8.1.2. NMR for flying training events. Crewmembers NMR for flying training events in Table 4.4
or Table 4.5 may fly unsupervised on MAFFS missions as long as the crewmembers do not accomplish
the specific event(s) that put them into NMR status. For pilots to be considered current for day visual
formation, day low level, and day airdrop the following events apply: VL01, VLL Day Event; VL11,
VLL Formation Day Event; any one airdrop event between AD03, Equipment Airdrop, AD04, CDS
Airdrop, or AD05, Personnel Airdrop. Loadmasters will be current in M050, Tactical Mission Sortie and
AD01, Basic Airdrop Event.

                                           GENERAL

1.1. Training Objective. This instruction prescribes basic policy and guidance for training
United States Air Force Combat Delivery C-130J crewmembers according to AFI 11-202,
Volume 1, Aircrew Training.
     1.1.1. The overall objective of the aircrew training program is to develop and maintain a
     high state of mission readiness for immediate and effective employment in exercises,
     peacekeeping operations, contingencies, and war in any environment. Mission readiness and
     effective employment are achieved through the development and mastery of core
     competencies for C-130J crewmembers. These core competencies include tactical ingress,
     tactical egress, airdrop, formation, assault landings, NVG operations during all phases of
     flight, instrument procedures, mission planning, landing zone (LZ) ground operations, crew
     management, and C4/AOC integration. Link mission and continuation training tables to
     AFTTP 3-3.C-130J, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals-C-130J, in order to retain a combat
     culture with leading edge technologies to anticipate warfighter needs.
     1.1.2. The secondary objective is to standardize C-130J training requirements into a single
     document to meet requirements for a basic document in AFPD 11-2.
1.2. Key Words Explained.
     1.2.1. â€•Willâ€– and â€•shallâ€– indicate a mandatory requirement.
     1.2.2. â€•Shouldâ€– is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
     accomplishment.
     1.2.3. â€•Mayâ€– indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
     1.2.4. â€•Noteâ€– indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which are considered essential
     to emphasize.
1.3. Administration.
     1.3.1. Recommendation for Change. Refer recommended changes and questions about this
     publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR), AMC/A3TA, using the AF IMT
     847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF IMT 847s from the field through
     the appropriate functional chain of command. The OPR address is AMC/A3T, 402 Scott
     Drive, Unit 3A1, Scott AFB, IL, 62225-5302.
     1.3.2. Throughout this document there are references to training requirements controlled by
     other AFI's. The controlling AFI may be updated after the publication of this document, so it
     is necessary to refer to the source document AFI for current guidance. If a conflict is
     identified for an ancillary training requirement, comply with the source document that
     establishes the training requirement. NOTE: For the purpose of this AFI, the term â€•C-130Jâ€–
     refers to both long and short body C-130J aircraft unless specifically differentiated.
     1.3.3. Local Training Guidance. Wings or groups may publish local training guidance;
     however, units may not change AFI guidance except where noted. Units will send one copy
     of their local training procedures to the parent MAJCOM Training OPR.

     sent from the student's Squadron Commander (SQ/CC) to Operations Group Commander
     (OG/CC) to MAJCOM/A3T (email format is acceptable). MAJCOM/A3T will submit
     approved recall letter (email or Fax) to AETC/A3R for follow on coordination with 19
     AF and Formal Training Unit (FTU) Registrar. Emergency recall during non-duty hours
     may be coordinated directly with applicable FTU Registrar, with follow up coordination
     with AETC/A3R & 19 AF on the next duty day.
  1.4.4. Wing Commander. WG/CC will ensure unit/local level agencies and facilities support
  aircrew ground training programs. Host and/or co-located units will develop local
  agreements to consolidate aircrew training support base-wide.
  1.4.5. Operations Groups.
     1.4.5.1. The OG/CC will convene a Training Review Panel (TRP) to be chaired by the
     OG/CC or a designated representative. Panel members should include representatives
     from squadron training, tactics, operations, safety and other areas as determined by the
     commander (i.e. ATS contractors, ARMS). Airlift Group Commanders (AG/CC) are
     considered the equivalent of OG/CC for purposes of this instruction.
         1.4.5.1.1. TRP Requirements. Convene the TRP twice per calendar year and
         maintain minutes for a period of two years (commanders may increase this frequency
         as required). Squadrons and detachments not collocated with their OG may conduct
         their own panel or provide representation to the unit's TRP. Panel minutes from non-
         collocated squadron and detachment TRPs will be forwarded to their OG training
         office for inclusion in the OG TRP.
         1.4.5.1.2. TRP Format. The TRP should review staff and crewmember management
         actions necessary to complete squadron flight and ground training programs.
         Suggested TRP topics include, but are not limited to current and forecast Flight
         Training Levels (FTL), upgrade and Continuation Training (CT) status, semi-annual
AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                               11


         requirement completion rates, crew position gains/losses, Aircraft Commander (AC),
         Instructor and Evaluator upgrades. Units should also review all unit-defined training
         â€•Xâ€– events for relevancy.
     1.4.5.2. The OG/CC will develop and maintain procedures with their local Military
     Personnel Flight (MPF) for individual crewmember counseling and personnel system
     updates affecting Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC) incurred from training
     described in this AFI. See AFI 11-202, Volume 1 Aircrew Training, AFI 36-2107, Active
     Duty Service Commitments, and course listing in ETCA for more information.
     1.4.5.3. The OG/CC may develop additional training requirements and/or programs as
     necessary to meet unit mission requirements. Units may include such requirements in a
     local supplement to this AFI.
     1.4.5.4. The OG/CC is responsible for establishing and maintaining the academic
     training program for non-Maintenance and Aircrew Training System (MATS) courses
     (may be delegated to squadron level). AMC/A3TA is the POC for determining MATS
     vs. non-MATS courses. The OG (or squadron OPR) will:
         1.4.5.4.1. Appoint primary and alternate instructors for each non-MATS course to be
         taught.
         1.4.5.4.2. Publish a ground training schedule (ANG/AFRC, as required) to include
         date, time, location, instructor and designated crewmembers for each course (both
         MATS and non-MATS). Units may include such details in a local supplement to this
         AFI.
         1.4.5.4.3. Use MAJCOM, MATS, or unit-developed training products and/or
         syllabus for all courses, as applicable. Units will reproduce courseware as applicable.
         1.4.5.4.4. Develop a procedure to monitor the academic training program for course
         content, currency of materials, instructor availability, and status of training aids.
         Squadrons should recommend to the commander changes to existing courses or
         additional academic training courses required, based on crewmember feedback.
         1.4.5.4.5. Send recommendations for changes, additions, and deletions of courses
         through appropriate channels to appropriate MAJCOM with an information copy to
         AMC/A3T.
     1.4.5.5. Instructor Selection and Training. The OG/CC will select course instructors for
     non-MATS courses on the basis of professional qualifications and aptitude to teach.
     Local Academics instructor program will follow guidance in AFMAN 36-2236,
     Guidebook for Air Force Instructors. An individual who instructs a class will receive
     credit for that academic training requirement.
  1.4.6. Squadrons. Sq/CC (or designated representative) will:
     1.4.6.1. Select DOT Chiefs from the most highly qualified and experienced instructors.
     Previous Evaluator or FTU experience is highly desired. ARC units with a single Sq may
     use the OST Chief for this purpose.
     1.4.6.2. Ensure Sq/DOT is manned with a minimum of one instructor for each crew
     position. Instructors should be selected based on experience, availability, and time on
12                                                     AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012


     station (to ensure continuity of operations for each crew position in DOT). ARC units
     with a single Sq may use OST for this purpose.
     1.4.6.3. Convene a Squadron Training Review Panel (STRP) to be chaired by the SQ/CC
     and/or SQ/DO. Panel members should include representatives from squadron training,
     squadron standardization/evaluation, ADOs, and the chief from each crew position.
     SQ/CCs should utilize the STRP to focus training objectives, ensure standards are being
     met, select upgrade candidates, and ensure completion of required continuation training.
        1.4.6.3.1. STRP Requirements. Squadrons will convene a STRP monthly (quarterly
        for AFRC and ANG) and maintain minutes for a period of two years. STRP minutes
        will be approved by the SQ/CC or DO and may be produced/distributed/stored
        electronically by the SQ/DOT. They will be maintained and disposed of in
        accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule referenced in the
        introduction.â€–
        1.4.6.3.2. STRP Format. The squadron TRP should review staff and crewmember
        management actions necessary to complete squadron flight and ground training
        programs. The STRP will review the current status of aircrew training to ensure that
        current training objectives are being met and that those individuals selected for
        upgrade training are the best candidates after reviewing their experience, proficiency
        level, and retainability. To accomplish these goals, suggested STRP topics include but
        are not limited to: crew position gains/losses, current upgrade/requalification training
        (i.e. crewmembers in an active training status), recently completed training (including
        performance during training and current certification status), future training
        (individuals already approved via STRP), upgrade candidates, current waivers,
        projected waivers, and continuation training status.
     1.4.6.4. Ensure crewmembers complete in-unit mission, ground, and continuation
     training programs.
     1.4.6.5. Before each semi-annual training period, assign Flying Training Levels (FTL) to
     assigned/attached crewmembers (see Chapter 4).
     1.4.6.6. Ensure supervisors complete AETC web-based formal school post-graduate
     questionnaires. The MATS contractor sends out a notification message via email to the
     training office point of contact (POC) of the unit, who forwards the email to the
     appropriate supervisor. The notification message is sent out approximately 90 days after
     the student graduates. To change the unit POC or gain access to the system, contact the
     MATS contractor at MATShelp@littlerock.af.mil. Complete the questionnaires on the
     AETC web-site at: https://www.my.af.mil/agepiftprod
     1.4.6.7. Ensure effective training continuity and supervision of assigned and attached
     crewmembers. Unit commanders may assign additional requirements based on
     individual crewmemberâ€™s experience and proficiency.
     1.4.6.8. Upon arrival, review training and evaluation records of newly assigned or
     attached crewmembers and those completing formal training, to determine the necessary
     training required to complete/certify the individual as Basic Aircraft Qualified (BAQ),
     Basic Mission Capable (BMC), or Mission Ready (MR).
AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                13


       1.4.6.9. Execute unit-level aircrew certifications described in this instruction.
       1.4.6.10. Review qualifications and monitor training requirements for unit-assigned
       flight surgeons.
       1.4.6.11. Ensure flight commanders or designated squadron representative monitor
       quality of training being accomplished, identify training deficiencies, and advise Sq/CC
       of additional training needs.
   1.4.7. Formal School with MATS Contractor. The C-130J MATS contractor is responsible
   for academic and Aircrew Training Device (ATD) instruction at the formal schools and
   specialized training at all USAF C-130J training sites. This responsibility includes
   developing, updating, and publishing courseware and syllabi in accordance with the MATS
   contract (see Chapter 6).
1.5. Waiver Authority.
   1.5.1. Do not deviate from the policies and requirements in this instruction, unless specific
   waiver authority is provided in this instruction. Report deviations or exceptions without
   waiver through channels to MAJCOM/A3T who, in turn, should notify the OPR for follow-

NOTES:
1. Units will submit secondary method training waiver requests through MAJCOM channels.
MAJCOMs will coordinate with 714 TRS/TRT to arrange courseware delivery to the unit.
2. References to operations groups and wings may be applied to airlift groups; references to
operations group training offices may apply to wing-level training offices.
3. AFRC units will send request through 22AF and AFRC/A3TA. AFRC/A3TA will determine if
waiver needs AETC/A3V review. ANG units will send waiver to NGB/A3O. NGB/A3O will
determine if waiver needs AETC/A3V review.


   1.5.4. Formal School Training and Prerequisites. Any planned exception to a formal course
   syllabus (or prerequisite) requires a syllabus waiver. Submit waiver requests through
   MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) to the waiver authority listed in the course syllabus. If
   required for unitsâ€™ designated mission, events waived or not accomplished at the formal
   school will be accomplished in-unit before assigning mission-ready (MR) status.
   1.5.5. In-Unit Training Waiver. MAJCOM/A3T is approval/waiver authority for in-unit
   training via secondary method. Provide information copies of any waivers to AETC/A3Z
   and AMC/A3T. Before approval, review the appropriate syllabus and consider availability of
   ATS formal instruction and ATD requirements. All in-unit training will utilize formal school
   courseware in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 1. MAJCOMs will coordinate with 714
   TRS to arrange courseware delivery to the unit for in-unit training.
   1.5.6. Senior Officer Course (SOC) Waiver. See formal course syllabus and AFI 11-202,
   Volume 1.
   1.5.7. Continuation Training Waiver. The OG/CC is designated waiver authority for ground
   flying continuation training requirements in Chapter 4 for assigned or attached
   crewmembers on a case-by-case basis (see paragraph 4.9). Waivers for training events
   missed in consecutive training periods will require MAJCOM approval.
   1.5.8. Waiver Format. MAJCOMs will establish waiver processes that may consist of on-
   line or web service, prescribed forms, or other standardized means. For AMC waivers, use
   the on-line waiver request service on the AMC/A3T website, AFRC website, or ANG
   procedures as appropriate. Submit waivers according to Table 1.1 using the format in
   Figure 1.1. Maintain a copy of all approved waivers for 24 months.

                                                           (Title)
1.6. Use of Flying Hours.
      1.6.1. Structure unit flying training missions to achieve optimum training. Any by-product
      airlift opportunity resulting from training will not degrade the intended training and will
      comply with applicable Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 4515.13R, Air
      Transportation Eligibility, AFI 11-401, Aviation Management and AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
         1.6.1.1. It is essential that all personnel at every level prevent the misuse of air mobility
         resources as well as the perception of their misuse when planning and executing training
         missions.
         1.6.1.2. See AFI 11-2C-130J, Volume 3, Flying Operations, for off-station training flight
         requirements.
      1.6.2. Training on Operational Missions. Unless specifically prohibited or restricted by
      weapon system operating procedures or specific theater operations order (OPORD), the
      OG/CC exercising operational control may approve upgrade, qualification or special
      qualification training on operational missions. In order to maximize efficient utilization of
      training resources, 618 TACC and tasked units will jointly identify and take maximum
      advantage of opportunities to conduct appropriate continuation training items which may be
 16                                                       AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012


   conveniently suited to concurrent operational mission segments. Examples include low-
   levels, assault landings, EROs, and circling approaches. If necessary 618th TACC and
   tasked-units will coordinate training mission numbers for the specific mission segment.
   Commanders will ensure the training will not impact mission effectiveness and the
   crewmember receiving training is under the supervision of an instructor of like specialty.
   Comply with passenger-carrying restrictions in AFI 11-401 and AFI 11-2C-130J, Volume 3.
1.7. In-Unit Training Time Limitations. Comply with the time limitations in Table 1.2
Crewmembers entered in an in-unit training program leading to qualification (or re-qualification)
will be dedicated to that training program on a full-time basis (OG/CC will approve any
exceptions).
   1.7.1. Training time start date is the date when the first significant training event (a training
   event directly contributing to qualification, certification, or upgrade) has begun, e.g.,
   Computer-Based Training (CBT) lesson, Part Task Trainer (PTT), Weapon System Trainer
   (WST), ground training, flight, etc.; or 45-days (90-days ARC) after being attached or
   assigned to the unit after completion of the formal school; whichever occurs first. Training
   time ends with the syllabus completion.
   1.7.2. Units will notify the appropriate MAJCOM/A3T in writing before the crewmember
   exceeds upgrade training time limits in Table 1.2 (AMC units should use the AMC website).
   Sq/CC may extend listed training times up to 60 days (120 days ARC) provided appropriate
   documentation is included in the training folder.        In such cases, notification to
   MAJCOM/A3T is not required.
       1.7.2.1. Extensions exceeding 60 days (120 days ARC) require MAJCOM/A3T
       approval.
       1.7.2.2. Use the waiver request format specified in paragraph 1.5.8. Include training
       difficulty, unit corrective action to resolve and prevent recurrence, and estimated
       completion date.

 NOTE: Time limit for cross-flow pilots is 120-days (240 days ARC).


1.8. Training Documentation. C-130J units will utilize the Electronic Grade Book (EGB) to
document training (See Attachment 2). Units will use the AF Form 4324, Aviation Resource
Management System (ARMS) Upgrade Worksheet, to update aircrew certifications in ARMS.
Blocks      5 â€“ 6 will be used to document initial, upgrade of, or downgrade of aircrew
qualification. It will also be used to document award of specific ARMS â€•Qâ€– code identifiers.
Specifically, block 22 will contain the following minimum information: â€•Qâ€– code (i.e. QXXX),
Certification Name (e.g. Phoenix Banner), and date of certification. See Chapter 7 for specific
â€•Qâ€– codes. See Attachment 2 for additional training documentation requirements.
1.9. Flight Examiner Usage. Use flight examiners as instructors for any phase of training to
capitalize on their expertise and experience. However, a flight examiner should not provide an
evaluation on students for whom they are the primary or recommending instructor.
1.10. Instructor Training and Supervision Requirements.
   1.10.1. All instructors should be MR (wing level and below).
   1.10.2. When performing crewmember duties, the following personnel will be under direct
   supervision of an instructor of like specialty:
       1.10.2.1. All non-current crewmembers while performing the specific event(s) for which
       they are non-current (See paragraph 4.9).
       1.10.2.2. All crewmembers in initial, upgrade or re-qualification flying training, unless
       syllabus states direct supervision is not required. Upgrade students may fly without an
       instructor when performing duties not related to the upgrade, unless otherwise restricted.
   1.10.2.3. Senior officers who have completed only the Senior Officer Course (SOC) (See
   paragraph 2.7.1).
       1.10.2.4. Any other personnel designated by the wing, OG, or Sq/CC.
1.11. Distribution. Units will establish distribution requirements of this AFI.
1.12. Transfer of Aircrews.
 18                                                     AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012


   1.12.1. Validated training completed prior to transfer will be honored by the gaining
   organization and will be used to determine the appropriate training phase and training level
   where the newly assigned crewmember is placed. Aircrew personnel qualified in the same
   mission-design-series (MDS) are considered qualified in that equipment throughout the force
   when used for the same mission. For intra-command and inter-command transfers and
   exchange officers, instructor training and qualifications may be accepted at the discretion of
   the gaining Sq/CC.
      1.12.1.1. Foreign exchange officers should arrive at the duty station qualified in the C-
      130J with a current physical and current physiological training. Mission qualification
      training should also have been completed. Exchange officers arriving from the formal
      school will complete local proficiency flying, tactical orientation and the following
      ground training events: Aircrew Flight Equipment, Aeromedical Rigging, Combat
      Offload, Initial Crew Resource Management (CRM), marshalling exam. Those who
      arrive â€•qualifiedâ€– from their country will complete the instrument refresher course (IRC),
      instrument written examination, simulator refresher, qualification open and closed-book
      examinations, flight evaluations, difference training, and local proficiency and tactical
      flying orientation. They will also complete physiological training, ground egress
      training, local area survival, and a flight physical if proper documentation cannot be
      produced.
      1.12.1.2. Requirements for foreign exchange officers to complete training that
      incorporates classified information, including G060 Tactics, G070 Aircrew Intelligence
      Training, G080 Communications Procedures, VT01/VT03 VTRAT Initial/Advanced, and
      M060 Theater Indoctrination Training will vary by country, security clearance, need to
      know, and specific exchange agreement. Consult the base Foreign Disclosure Officer
      (FDO) to determine an individual's eligibility to receive classified training. For example,
      some countries' exchange officers are only eligible to complete these events if they will
      deploy with their host U.S. unit. Some exchange officers may not complete any, and
      others have no restrictions and may complete all of these events.
      1.12.1.3. Partially mission qualified crewmembers (e.g., visual formation but not station
      keeping equipment (SKE)) may be fully qualified in-unit, with appropriate MATS
      courseware. Request waiver from the MAJCOM/ A3T.
1.13. Aircrew Training While DNIF. Crewmembers whose status is â€•duty not involving
flyingâ€– (DNIF) may complete ground training events, including simulator training, if the
memberâ€™s physical condition allows. Consult the flight surgeon initiating the AF Form 1042,
Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty, if the DNIF status includes
ground training limitations.
1.14. Aircrew Rated Management Overview.
   1.14.1. Program Requirements Document (PRD). According to AFI 11-412, Aircrew
   Management, HQ AF/A3O-AT projects C-130J long-range training requirements annually in
   a process called the PRD. Lead and user commands contribute to the PRD, which becomes a
   key long-range planning tool for training requirements.
   1.14.2. Programmed Flying Training (PFT). AETC/A3R manages the training commandâ€™s
   role in the HQ AF/A3O-AT Flying Training CONOPS. A key product of this process is the
AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                19


   PFT. The PFT balances available training quotas, MATS throughput, schoolhouse capacities
   and course requirements on a Fiscal Year basis. Annually, units will send projected PFT
   requirements to their respective MAJCOM training staff, who in turn forward projections to
   HQ AF/A3O-AT for inclusion into the Graduate Program Requirements Document (GPRD).
   AETC/A3R will determine training capacity and report shortfall in the GPRD to HQ
   AF/A3O-AT.
       1.14.2.1. HQ AF/A3O-AT sponsors an annual PFT conference to balance pipeline
       production requirements and MAJCOM training requests against Formal Training Unit
       (FTU) capacity. AETC/A3R allocates approved quotas to lead and each user command,
       which in-turn allocate training quotas to each unit. HQ AETC/A3R will publish the
       annual PFT quota workbook on CoP: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/AETCPFT.
       1.14.2.2. Throughout the training year, MAJCOM training staff and AETC PFT
       managers use assigned/allocated training quotas to assign individual crewmembers into
       the C-130J formal school. Daily student quota adjustments to the annual PFT are made
       on quota management documents. HQ AETC/A3R publishes the quota management
       documents on the web site listed in the previous paragraph.
1.15. Information Management. MAJCOMs may establish a training website to facilitate
information flow with the units. See unit training office or MAJCOM Supplement (if published)
for additional information. AMC hosts lead command training information and courseware
applicable to all C-130 units on the AMC/A3T Community of Practice (CoP) at
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/AMC_A3T              and       the     AMC/A3TA       CoP        at
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/AMC_A3TA.
1.16. Failure to Progress or Complete Training. If a student fails to progress according to
syllabus or training requirements, the command accomplishing the training will conduct a
Progress Review (PR) IAW AFI 11-202V1.
1.17. Career Enlisted Aviator (CEA). CEA qualifications are not tied to AFMAN 36-2108,
Airman Classification, skill level upgrade. All enlisted aircrew qualifications are separate and
distinct from skill level qualification. When an AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification,
is completed for the applicable flight evaluation, then that crewmember is qualified to perform
all duties assigned to that crew qualification regardless of skill level. Aircrew instructor and
flight examiner qualifications are also separate and distinct from On-the-Job (OJT) trainer or
certifier designation and are reflected in Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) by use of â€•Kâ€– prefix
(aircrew instructor) and â€•Qâ€– prefix (aircrew flight examiner) identifiers.
1.18. AMC Orientation Tour / Global Ready Aircraft Commander Course
(GRACC). Active duty units will be given priority over AFRC and ANG units due to
mandatory upgrade requirements for AMC crews established in AFI 11-MDS Volume 1. Do not
submit more than two candidates per wing per class without the GRACC scheduler's approval.
Submit names NET 45 days and NLT 30 days prior to CSD. AMC/A3TF will release the class
roster 30 days prior to CSD for units to confirm the names and make any necessary corrections.
Unfilled quotas will be available 14 days prior to CSD and units will be notified. Cancellations
must be received NLT four duty days prior to CSD to avoid a no-show. AMC/A3TF will not
accept any additions 72 hours/3 days prior to CSD. Units can still cancel 24 hours prior to CSD
to avoid a no-show being charged to the unit. No-shows will be handled IAW this paragraph.
Questions regarding GRACC Scheduling can be referred to AMC/A3TF, DSN 779-7881.

1.19. Senior Officer Training Coordination. All Senior Officer training is directed by
AF/DPO, AF/DPG offices (except ANG and AFRC) in coordination with MAJCOM Senior
Leaders Management office and AMC/A3TF and HQ AETC/A3R. ANG and AFRC will
develop procedures to validate Senior Officer training requests. After validation, ANG and
AFRC will coordinate training with AETC/A3R and inform AMC/A3TF. Questions regarding
the Senior Officer training course, availability and prerequisites can be forwarded to AMC/A3TF
@ DSN 779-3577. Except for ANG and AFRC, no formal actions to schedule training will be
taken until directed by AF/DPO or AF/DPG in conjunction with MAJCOM Senior Leaders
Management offices.

                           INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General Requirements. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 defines initial qualification training. This
chapter specifies minimum training requirements for initial qualification, re-qualification, senior
officer courses, conversion, and transition training. The primary method of initial qualification is
to attend and complete the appropriate formal training course in the ETCA. When attendance is
not practical or a quota is not available, units will request a waiver to conduct in-unit
qualification training using formal school courseware (See paragraph 1.5).
2.2. Initial Qualification Training (IQT) Prerequisites: Complete initial qualification
training, conversion training, and transition training prerequisites in accordance with AFI 11-202
Volume 1, the ETCA, this publication, and the course syllabus.
2.3. Ground Training Requirements. Complete syllabus and ancillary ground training
requirements for initial qualification, conversion training, and transition training in accordance
with AFI 11-202 Volume 1, the ETCA, and this instruction.
   2.3.1. Initial Qualification Ground Training Events. Students entered into formal
   undergraduate and graduate training programs leading to aircrew qualification will
   accomplish the events listed in Table 2.1 These events should be accomplished during
   Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT), Basic Training, Aircrew Fundamentals Course (AFC),
   Basic Loadmaster School (BLM), survival training or C-130J initial qualification courses.
   The FTU will provide the gaining unit with documentation indicating completion of items in
   Table 2.1 The FTU will document events accomplished during formal school training in the
   individual's training record prior to graduation from the C-130J initial qualification course.
   Gaining units will ensure all initial qualification events are completed prior to completing
   mission certification. If in-unit initial or re-qualification training is accomplished in lieu of
   formal school attendance, the unit is responsible for ensuring all requirements are completed.
   NOTE: Table 2.1 only includes ground training requirements that specifically apply to
   aircrew. This AFI is not the directive authority for all ground training. Individuals are
   responsible for completing additional ancillary ground training requirements as
   specified in AFI 36-2201 and other applicable instructions.
       2.3.1.1. Ground and flying training events accomplished during formal training will use
       the course completion date (successful evaluation date) to establish the due dates for all
       subsequent currency and requirements. Completion of Initial Combat SERE Schools
       according to AFI 16-1301, Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE)
       Operations, and initial Aircrew Flight Equipment training (during formal school) will
       establish the follow-on due dates of training (based on the date first completing the
       course) for recurring training requirements.
       2.3.1.2. Training missions may be flown before completing all items listed, provided
       physiological training, physical, egress training, aircrew flight equipment familiarization
       training and marshalling exam are accomplished.

NOTES:
Previously certified and qualified mission ready crewmembers transferring between units or in a
cross-flow program (between flying units) only need LL01, G002 and any applicable events in
which they have lost currency. In addition, cross-flow crewmembers require G060.
1. Mandatory grounding item; individual will not fly until required training is accomplished.
2. Active Duty only.
3. Not required for BAQ crewmembers (includes senior officers and staff officers maintaining
BAQ).
4. All crewmembers will complete VT01; however, events only affect mission ready status for
units co-located with a VTRAT device.
5. Flight Physical and Physiological Training are tracked on the top of each crewmemberâ€™s
AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                   23


Individual Training Summary (ITS). Therefore, there is no need to assign and track these
training events in the training module of ARMS. If units want to track in ARMS, use G005 and
G006 per Chapter 7.


2.4. Flying Training Requirements. Complete flying training requirements for initial
qualification in accordance with the formal school syllabus, AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and this
instruction.
2.5. Conversion, Transition and Difference Training.
   2.5.1. Conversion Training. Conversion training which results in a new aircraft qualification
   requires completion of a formal school initial qualification course. Conversion training is
   normally associated with a unit conversion to another MDS (e.g., C-17 to C-130J). IAW 11-
   202V1, for unit conversions, when formal school courses are not available to handle the
   throughput, MAJCOMs will develop in-unit training plans in coordination with AETC that
   maximize use of highly experienced personnel as the initial cadre. Units will coordinate with
   their respective MAJCOMs for in-unit training plans.
       2.5.1.1. Form a nucleus of instructor and flight examiner personnel (initial cadre) to
       begin aircrew conversion. Units converting may request initial cadre waiver of PAI time
       requirement. Send waivers through appropriate MAJCOM channels and include the
       information specified in paragraph 1.5. Additionally, include the most recent aircraft
       flown and total time in that aircraft in the remarks section of the waiver.
       2.5.1.2. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held,
       e.g. C-17 or C-130E mission pilot (MP) to C-130J evaluator pilot (EP) unless previously
       qualified in the new aircraft.
       2.5.1.3. If accomplishing in-unit training IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1, units will publish
       a letter identifying initial cadre of instructors and flight examiners by crew qualification.
   2.5.2. Transition Training (TX). Transition training is a shortened version of initial
   qualification training that gives aircrew members cross-flowing from another military aircraft
   credit for acquired aviation proficiency. Transition from one C-130 MDS to another (C-
   130E/H, C-130J, C-130 AMP) will be accomplished using MAJCOM approved training
   syllabuses.
   2.5.3. Difference Training. Complete difference training to qualify crewmembers in a
   different series C-130J aircraft. When mission ready (MR), basic aircraft qualification
   (BAQ), or basic mission capable (BMC) crewmembers need to complete difference training
   for a C-130J having the same mission as their former C-130J model, there may be additional
   mission qualification training depending on the crewmemberâ€™s experience and aircraft
   equipment (i.e. block upgrades). Sq/CC will determine mission training required. Instructor
   and Flight Examiner crewmembers converting from one model C-130J to another may
   remain instructors or flight evaluators at the discretion of the gaining unit commander (or
   appropriate ARC Air Operations Officer). Send recommendations through MAJCOM
   channels to AMC/A3TA when additional difference training requirements are identified.
   Prior to flying, ensure the ground training requirements in paragraph 3.3.1 are met.
 24                                                         AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012


       2.5.3.1. Difference training to other models of the C-130 is not applicable. Training
       between the C-130E/H, C-130AMP, and C-130J (and vice versa) is transition training.
2.6. Multiple Qualifications. MAJCOMs may authorize qualification in more than one MDS
aircraft for crewmembers only when such action is directed by command mission requirements
and is justifiable and in the best interests of the command. This authority cannot be delegated
below the MAJCOM level (see AFI 11-202 Volume 1). Crewmembers will attend a formal
initial qualification or transition course for multiple qualifications in different MDS aircraft (e.g.,
C-130J and C-130H). Crewmembers will, at a minimum, maintain FTL A currency
requirements in each aircraft (N/A for senior officers). Crewmembers will refer to the MDS-
specific AFIs for training requirements in the other aircraft. For units changing MDS aircraft,
MAJCOMS may adjust training requirements to align with numbers of assigned aircraft until the
transition is complete.
2.7. Senior Officer Qualification Requirements. See formal course syllabus and AFI 11-202,
Volume 1. See paragraph 1.5.6 for waiver guidance.
   2.7.1. Senior officer qualification is reserved for rated officer positions requiring operational
   flying. This includes O-6 selects and above, and in some cases, O-5s permanently filling an
   O-6 position. Unless specifically requested, justified and validated (by MAJCOM/A3),
   senior officers will attend the SOC. The SOC results in a supervised status and basic aircraft
   qualification (BAQ); these senior officers will fly with an instructor and maintain FTL E
   continuation training requirements. Senior officers who maintain FTL E should maintain
   Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) requirements (See paragraph 4.3.1.5). Exception:
   Senior officers with a requirement to fly unsupervised (limited to wing/group commanders
   and their deputies) may complete a TX or appropriate SOC course (as defined by the ETCA)
   of instruction leading to unsupervised qualification. The 714 TRS/TRT office is responsible
   for recommending a formal training course for initial qualification and mission qualification
   based on the senior officerâ€™s flying experience and familiarity with the weapons system.
   After OG/CC review, the MAJCOM/A3T will approve the proposed training plan prior to
   execution.
   2.7.2. Mission ready senior officers flying unsupervised will be current and qualified and
   should maintain FTL A continuation training requirements.
   2.7.3. Senior officer training, qualification, and certification should occur within the first 180
   days after assuming the assignment.
2.8. Flight Surgeons. Flight Surgeons are allowed to fly locally as defined by OG/CC and log
time in their primary MDS while in training for initial (mission) qualification. See paragraph 3.5
for training requirements.
2.9. Requalification Training. AFI 11-202 Volume 1 specifies requalification training limits
and requirements. See Attachment 3 for formal Aircrew Training System courses. The
secondary method of requalification is applicable if the formal course is required, but not
practical, or quotas are not available. Units will request a waiver from their parent MAJCOM.
Unless specified otherwise in AFI 11-202 Volume 1, a crewmember is unqualified upon
expiration of the qualification evaluation, loss of currency exceeding 6 months (for currency
items specified in Chapter 4), or completion of a qualification evaluation in a different MDS
(EXCEPTION: When authorized multiple qualifications).
AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                 25


  2.9.1. The AFI 11-202 Volume 1 requalification training limits and requirements also apply
  to loss of mission qualification or certification as specified in paragraph 4.9.
  2.9.2. For those events requiring certification but no recurring training such as Phoenix
  Banner, loss of aircraft qualification due to expiration of the qualification evaluation results
  in loss of those certifications. The Sq/CC will determine if training is required to regain
  certification. The Sq/CC should consider items to include the amount of time since
  expiration of aircraft qualification, crewmember's experience level, and any changes to the
  event when determining what, if any, training is required. If training is required, options
  could range from only ground training to the full syllabus for the certification.
  2.9.3. If in-unit requalification training is accomplished in lieu of formal school attendance,
  the unit is responsible for ensuring all requirements in Table 2.1 have been previously
  completed.
 26                                                     AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012


                                          Chapter 3

            MISSION QUALIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. Description. This chapter establishes minimum criteria and training requirements for
mission qualification and certification training. All crewmembers will complete initial,
conversion, or transition qualification prior to mission qualification training and mission
certification. Primary method of mission qualification training (MQT) is by attending the formal
school and completing the appropriate ETCA course. Except where specifically stated, units
conducting training may arrange mission sequence or sequence training events as necessary to
use flying training hours effectively and accomplish the training mission.
3.2. Time Periods for Mission Qualification and Certification Training. See Table 1.2 A
crewmember will be mission ready (MR) after completion of all ground training and flying
training requirements, review and certification by Sq/CC or Review and Certification (R & C)
Board for aircraft commander (AC) according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2, AMC supplement.
   3.2.1. Mobility pilot development (MPD) and Cross-Flow Graduates. Prior to aircraft
   commander certification, a MR MPD or cross-flow graduate (see Attachment 3) will be
   designated as a MR pilot (FPQ) for Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) and
   TRP purposes and may fly as a qualified pilot on any crew including operational missions.
   MPD and pilot cross-flow graduates may not fly as a pilot-in-command until certified as an
   aircraft commander (See paragraph 5.3).
   3.2.2. Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) Tracking. Pilot graduates from
   formal training will initially be coded per Table 5.2 for ARMS tracking. Newly assigned
   crewmembers that are initially qualifying or re-qualifying in the unit mission will be counted
   as basic qualified (FP for pilots, FL for loadmasters) for ARMS and TRP purposes. This is
   for ARMS tracking only and does not affect the crewmemberâ€™s aircraft qualification on the
   AF Form 8. Upon completion of all ground and flying training requirements, units will
   certify the crewmembers as mission ready and change the ARMS codes to reflect mission
   qualified.
3.3. Ground Training Requirements. Complete all syllabus and ground training events in
Table 2.1 and Table 3.1 before certification as mission ready. Training may be accomplished
concurrently with other training.  NOTE: This AFI is not the directive authority for all
ground training. Individuals are responsible for completing additional ancillary ground
training requirements as specified in AFI 36-2201 and other applicable instructions.
   3.3.1. Training missions may be flown before completing all items listed in Table 2.1 and
   Table 3.1, provided physiological training, flight physical, emergency egress training, local
   area survival, aircrew flight equipment familiarization training and marshalling exam are
   accomplished.
   3.3.2. Ground and flying training events accomplished during formal training will use the
   course completion date (successful evaluation date) to establish the due dates for all
   subsequent currency and requirements. Completion of Initial Combat Survival Training
   (SS20), Initial Water Survival Training (SS30), and initial Aircrew Flight Equipment training
   during formal school establishes the due date (based on date of first completed course) for
   recurring Combat Survival (SS02), Conduct After Capture (SS03), Water Survival (SS05)
AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                               27


   and Emergency Parachuting Training (SS06). Completion of Initial Combat Survival
   Training (SS20) establishes the due date for recurring Law of Armed Conflict (G100) and
   Force Protection (E114).
   3.3.3. Local Ground Training Supplements. Subordinate units may supplement ground
   training IAW AFI 33-360 and applicable governing instructions that establish individual
   event requirements. Formal School OG/CCs, the Commandant USAF Weapons School
   (USAFWS), and other unique units with special requirements may determine, obtain
   MAJCOM approval, and publish (local supplement) ground training requirements for their
   units (e.g., to define requirements for BMC crewmembers).

 NOTES:
 Previously certified and qualified mission ready crewmembers transferring between units or in a
 cross-flow program (between flying units) only need any applicable events in which they have
 lost currency.
 1. Accomplish upon arrival after each permanent change of station (N/A if crewmemberâ€™s flying
 unit of assignment/attachment does not change). See event description in Chapter 7.
 2. Required for theater-assigned and deploying crewmembers. See event description in Chapter
 7 for additional details.
 3. AFI 11-2C-130J Volume 1 is not the reference publication governing completion of this
 event. Therefore, IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1, Paragraph 7, refer to reference publications
 which provide guidance for accomplishment of ancillary training requirements.
 4. Required prior to first flight.


3.4. Flying Training Requirements.
   3.4.1. BAQ crewmembers pursuing MR status will be assigned a Flight Training Level and
   accomplish continuation training requirements IAW Chapter 4. Continuation training
   requirements will be prorated based on the training time start date as defined in paragraph
   1.7.1. Crewmembers will credit events accomplished during mission certification training
   IAW paragraph 4.4.1. Crewmembers pursuing MR status who fail to accomplish minimum
28                                                      AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012


  aircrew requirements (currency and semi-annual) must fly in a supervised status when that
  event is required for a particular flight.
     3.4.1.1. Crewmembers in mission certification training who fail to accomplish all semi-
     annual training requirements must complete training IAW paragraph 4.10.7 prior to
     awarding MR status. On a case-by-case basis, the Sq/CC may review the crewmember's
     training accomplished and waive incomplete requirements as required (document the
     waiver in the crewmemberâ€™s training folder). Crewmembers non-current for an event
     may be certified MR on a case-by-case basis, but the crewmember will remain NMR for
     that event and will be supervised on any flight requiring that event IAW paragraph
     4.10.2.2.
     3.4.1.2. After arrival at duty station, all crewmembers will receive a local area briefing
     and supervised local orientation flight (not applicable for in-unit initial, re-qualification
     or upgrade training). The lack of a local briefing and local flight does not preclude the
     crewmember from deploying as MR.
  3.4.2. Loadmaster Training.
     3.4.2.1. Personnel Certification. Normally, loadmasters will complete the FTU mission
     qualification course without obtaining actual personnel airdrop certification. In these
     cases, use standard airdrop training bundles (SATB) during flight training. Document the
     substitution according to Attachment 2. Accomplish final certification for personnel
     airdrop in-unit under the supervision of an instructor loadmaster or flight examiner
     loadmaster on an actual static line personnel airdrop.
     3.4.2.2. Aircraft Refueling. Hands-on aircraft refueling is not accomplished during the
     FTU qualification courses. As minimum all loadmasters will accomplish one aircraft
     refueling to the satisfaction of an instructor prior to flying unsupervised.
  3.4.3. Assault Landing Training. Conduct assault takeoff and landing initial qualification
  training on a landing zone (or painted landing zone) of 3,000 feet or longer. Assault takeoffs
  should be performed from the main runway when it is available (i.e., safe and practical to
  taxi from an assault landing zone). Takeoffs from the assault zone are authorized IAW AFI
  11-2C-130J, Volume 3), and during formal mission qualification training conducted either at
  the formal school or via the secondary method.
  3.4.4. Units North of the 60 Parallel. Crewmembers in units north of the 60 N parallel, who
  are scheduled to complete secondary method (in-unit) mission qualification training during
  the summer months (May through August), have until 31 August to complete the required
  night training events. The mission qualification evaluation for these crewmembers may be
  administered before completing night training events.
  3.4.5. Joint Airborne and Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT) Missions. When
  participating in JA/ATT missions, unqualified and non-current crewmembers may be utilized
  in their respective crew positions provided they are supervised by an instructor or flight
  examiner (See paragraph 1.10). Comply with AFI 11-401 when carrying passengers
  (including paratroopers).
  3.4.6. Local Flying Training Supplements. Subordinate units may supplement ground
  training IAW AFI 33-360. Formal School OG/CCs, the Commandant USAF Weapons
AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                 29


   School (USAFWS), and other unique units with special requirements may determine, obtain
   MAJCOM approval, and publish (local supplement) flying training requirements for their
   units (e.g., to define requirements for BMC crewmembers).
3.5. Aircraft Defensive Systems (ADS). ADS Training is not a separate certification, but all
aircrew will receive Aircraft Defensive System (ADS) training (applicable to the unitâ€™s ADS
configuration) during Unit Indoctrination or difference training. Training will include academic
and WST/flight training for all crewmembers. See AFTTP 3-3.C-130J, Attachment 3 for an
unclassified defensive systems training guide and AFTTP 3-1.C-130J for classified defensive
information. Training should be conducted by a graduate of the USAF Weapons School,
Mobility Electronic Combat Officers Course (MECOC), or as designated by the unit
commander.
   3.5.1. Ground Training. Academic training will cover as a minimum, threat systems, basic
   principles of Infrared (IR) threats and flares, radar and chaff, how ADS work, how to operate
   the system, use of checklists, malfunctions, emergency procedures, and defensive maneuvers
   during takeoff, low-level, medium/high-altitude, airdrop, and landing.
   3.5.2. WST/Flight Training. WST/flight training will cover preflight actions, aircraft walk-
   around, system turn-on, and a flight profile that should include defensive maneuvers from
   high/medium altitude, during a low-level, after slowdown and before a simulated airdrop,
   and a simulated approach to landing. If training in the aircraft, calls for in-flight reactions
   (simulated ADS inputs or simulated visual sightings) should come either from the instructor
   conducting the training or as a result of the instructorâ€™s input to another aircrew member.
3.6. Flight Surgeon Mission Qualification Requirements. Before deploying or acting as
aircrew in any aircraft other than their primary flight surgeons must fly at least two sorties in
their primary aircraft, complete all required ground training events listed in Table 4.3 (for the
primary aircraft), and accomplish flight surgeon testing on the AFDL website.

                                           Chapter 4

                                CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. Description. This chapter establishes the minimum flying and related ground training
requirements to maintain an assigned aircrew training status (BAQ, BMC, MR). The unit
commander will ensure each crewmember receives sufficient training to maintain individual
proficiency.
4.2. Aircrew Status. Squadron commanders will assign C-130J crewmembers an aircrew status
IAW the following criteria:
   4.2.1. Mission Ready.        For SORTS, operational tasking, and deployments, a MR
   crewmember is defined as one who is available and qualified in the unit's mission (completed
   mission certification for the applicable crew position).
   4.2.2. Non-Mission Ready (NMR). A crewmember that is unqualified, non-current or
   incomplete in required continuation training, or not certified to perform the unit mission. See
   paragraph 4.9 for specific guidance on crewmembers who are non-current or incomplete in
   required continuation training.
   4.2.3. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). A crewmember who has satisfactorily completed
   mission qualification training, is qualified in some aspect of the unit mission, but does not
   maintain MR status. The crewmember maintains familiarization in the command or unitâ€™s
   operational mission. Includes crewmembers assigned to MAJCOM, NAF and other line and
   non-line units.
      4.2.3.1. The crewmember shall be able to attain full unit mission certification to meet
      operational taskings within 45 days.
      4.2.3.2. The OG/CC may define a portion of the unitâ€™s operational mission and declare
      an assigned or attached crewmember Mission Ready if all training requirements for that
      part of the operational mission are met. The crewmember does not need to attain full
      mission certification unless directed by the OG/CC.
      4.2.3.3. Formal School BMC crewmembers are qualified to conduct all aspects of the
      formal training mission. Formal school instructors will be qualified and certified in the
      training/unit mission before performing instructor duties. Formal school crewmembers
      may fly 618th TACC-directed missions, but they will comply with any MR requirements
      required for that mission.
      4.2.3.4. BMC crewmembers may log instructor or evaluator time for the portion of the
      mission for which they are current and qualified IAW AFI 11-401.
   4.2.4. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ). Aircrew may be designated BAQ after
   completion of C-130 qualification training (initial, conversion, transition, or requalification).
   4.2.5. MR, BMC, and BAQ crewmembers will accomplish and/or maintain the requirements
   in AFI 11-202, Volume 1 (for their respective status) and the appropriate events in the
   ground and semi-annual flying continuation tables in this AFI.
4.3. Flying Training Levels (FTL).
AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                    31


   4.3.1. The Sq/CC determines the FTL before each semi-annual period. Assign new unit
   crewmembers a FTL during in-processing. Base FTL on experience and aircraft proficiency.
   Crewmembers may have a different FTL for different flying qualifications, i.e. a
   crewmember may be a FTL A â€“ aircraft commander, but a FTL C â€“ airdrop pilot.
       4.3.1.1. FTL A Highly Experienced Crewmembers. Sq/CC may assign highly
       experienced MR line crewmembers to this level. This may include MR or NMR
       MAJCOM headquarters, 618th TACC personnel, AETC instructors, NAF personnel,
       USAF EC instructors, wing, OG, and Sq/CCs, operations officers, personnel assigned to
       OG evaluation positions, and any instructors assigned primarily to staff duties. NOTE:
       NMR crewmembers assigned to MAJCOM headquarters, NAF, Expeditionary Mobility
       Task Force (EMTF), 618th TACC, USAF Expeditionary Center (EC), Contingency
       Response Group (CRG), Air Mobility Operations Group (AMOG), FTU, or direct
       reporting unit may be categorized as BMC and assigned to FTL A. In addition, these
       individuals will accomplish annual CRM training requirements. These individuals may
       fly unsupervised on any mission provided they are current and qualified for that mission.
       4.3.1.2. FTL B Experienced MR Crewmember.
       4.3.1.3. FTL C MR Crewmember. MPD and cross-flow pilots should be assigned to
       FTL C. If desired, Sq/CCs may assign highly proficient MPD and cross-flow pilots to
       FTL A or FTL B.
       4.3.1.4. FTL D No longer used.
       4.3.1.5. FTL E â€” BAQ or BMC non-instructor staff. May include senior officers,
       MAJCOM, NAF, and 618th TACC staff who are not maintaining MR or instructor status.
       FTL E requirements are insufficient for MR status and crewmembers assigned to this
       FTL will fly with an instructor of like specialty at all times. For pilots, an instructor will
       be at a set of controls during critical phases of flight. In addition, FTL E pilots will be
       current in takeoffs, landings, and instrument approaches before carrying passengers.
   4.3.2. Change of FTL. Once the semi-annual period begins, do not move a crewmember to a
   level requiring fewer events. Prorate events upon changing training levels.
4.4. Training Events/Tables. Standardized ARMS training event identifiers and description
are located in Chapter 7. Designate unit defined events as â€•Xâ€– event (i.e. X020). Units will
include a description in their local training procedures.
   4.4.1. Crediting Event Accomplishment.          Credit events accomplished on training,
   operational missions and satisfactory evaluations or certifications toward currency
   requirements and establish a subsequent due date. Use date of successful evaluation as the
   date of accomplishment for all ground and flying training events that were trained during a
   formal course. This date establishes currency for flying events. NOTE: Flying training events
   accomplished during upgrade training prior to the evaluation are credited towards the
   requirements for the current crew position. For flying training during initial qualification or
   requalification training, events accomplished prior to the evaluation are not credited to any
   crew position. Events successfully accomplished on the evaluation or certification are
   credited toward the new crew position.
32                                                      AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012


     4.4.1.1. Crewmembers pursuing in-unit MR status will be assigned a Flying Training
     Level (FTL) during in-processing and accomplish continuation training and unit MR
     requirements. Continuation training requirements will be prorated based on the training
     time start date as defined in paragraph 1.7.1. Crewmembers will credit events
     accomplished during unit MR training toward the new crew position with the exception
     of those events not trained during initial training or those events restricted on the initial
     AF Form 8 (i.e.; personnel airdrop). Those events may be credited on the
     certification/qualification flight for that event. Crewmembers pursuing MR status who
     fail to accomplish minimum aircrew requirements (currency and semi-annual) must fly in
     a supervised status when that event is required for a particular flight.
     4.4.1.2. The failure to accomplish semi-annual training requirements during unit MR
     training must be rectified prior to awarding MR status. On a case-by-case basis, the
     Sq/CC may review the crewmember's semi-annual training accomplished during unit MR
     training and waive incomplete requirements as required. (Document the waiver in the
     crewmemberâ€™s training folder.) The goal is to ensure the new crewmember is ready to
     assume MR status in all areas of the unit mission. On a case-by-case basis, Sq/CC may
     declare crewmembers MR if still NMR for an event, but the crewmember will remain
     NMR for that event and will be supervised on any flight requiring that event IAW
     Paragraph 4.9.1.
     4.4.1.3. If the new crewmember is maintaining the same FTL or training table after
     attaining MR status, no additional proration is required or allowed.
     4.4.1.4. Units may develop local mission accomplishment reports and/or training
     accomplishment reports to document continuation training for processing into ARMS.
     See AFI 11-202, Volume 1, Chapter 4, for additional guidance.
  4.4.2. For an unsatisfactory flight evaluation, do not log continuation training requirements
  for those events graded Q-3 (according to AFI 11-2C-130J, Volume 2) until re-qualified.
  Sq/CC will determine which events of paragraph 4.4.1 will be allowed for credit based on
  AF Form 8 evaluation description.
  4.4.3. Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period.
  4.4.4. Instructor and flight examiner training requirements. Instructors and flight examiners
  may credit 50 percent of their total requirements while instructing or evaluating.
  EXCEPTION: Instructor and flight examiner pilots may not credit any takeoffs or landings
  flown by another pilot.
  4.4.5. Crewmembers should see event descriptions in Chapter 7 for additional details on
  crediting specific events. Pilots may credit selected mission events while performing Pilot
  Monitoring (PM) duties (refer to Table 4.4).
  4.4.6. Local Flying Training Supplements. Subordinate units may supplement flying
  training IAW AFI 33-360. Formal School OG/CCs, the Commandant USAF Weapons
  School (USAFWS), and other unique units with special requirements may determine, obtain
  MAJCOM approval, and publish (local supplement) ground and flying continuation training
  requirements for their units (e.g., to define requirements for BMC crewmembers).
  4.4.7. Documenting Aircrew Training Events.
AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                 33


      4.4.7.1. All training events will be recorded in ARMS.
          4.4.7.1.1. Training events conducted during block training or phase training may be
          consolidated under one ARMS entry.
          4.4.7.1.2. Combined training events may have only one ARMS entry.
          4.4.7.1.3. Input all one-time events and events required for permanent change-of-
          station (PCS) in the ARMS database. Units may maintain one-time events on the
          crewmemberâ€™s currency report.
      4.4.7.2. See Attachment 2 for additional requirements.
4.5. Continuation Training Requirements.
   4.5.1. Completion and tracking of continuation training is ultimately the responsibility of the
   individual crewmember. Crewmembers should actively work with unit schedulers and
   training offices to ensure their continuation training is accomplished as described in this
   chapter.
   4.5.2. Ground Training Events. Crewmembers will comply with requirements of Table 4.1
   and Table 4.2         NOTE: Tables 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 only include ground training
   requirements that specifically apply to aircrew. This AFI is not the directive authority
   for all ground training. Individuals are responsible for completing additional ground
   training requirements as specified in AFI 36-2201 and other applicable instructions.
      4.5.2.1. Failure to accomplish events in Table 4.1 or Table 4.3 leads to non-mission
      ready status. See paragraph 4.9 for regaining mission ready status.
      4.5.2.2. Failure to complete mobility training requirements in Table 4.2 does not lead to
      non-mission ready status but may restrict crewmember from certain missions.
      4.5.2.3. Crewmembers (i.e., NAF, MAJCOM, USAF EC , etc) attached to units may
      accomplish ground training events at locations other than their unit of attachment. The
      crewmember is responsible for reporting accomplished training events to their unit of
      attachment (ARMS office).
      4.5.2.4. At the crewmembers discretion, ground training that does not degrade required
      response time or mission completion may be accomplished during extended alert duty
      (more than 24 hours). Specify additional requirements and or restrictions in MAJCOM
      supplement or local training procedures.
      4.5.2.5. Flight Surgeons use requirements in Table 4.3.
      4.5.2.6. Ancillary Training. See paragraph 4.7

NOTES:
1. Mandatory grounding item on expiration date; individual will not fly until required training
is accomplished. Flight physicals become due 366 days after the previous physical, and expire
after the 455th day or as indicated on the AF IMT 1042, whichever occurs first. The required
frequency may vary to address waivers and/or individual physical limitations (as determined by
the Flight Surgeon), but in no case will exceed 455 days. Flight physical and physiological
training are independently tracked via the crewmemberâ€™s Individual Training Summary (ITS)
and thus do not require an ARMS code. If units want to track in ARMS, use G005 and G006
per Chapter 7.

NOTES:
1. Mandatory grounding item.

2. Flight Surgeons without an aviation unit mobility requirement (e.g. non-operational staff or
leadership role in Aerospace Medicine, and Flight Surgeons undergoing training in the USAF
Residency in Aerospace Medicine) do not need to accomplish this training.

3. The OG/CC or equivalent is the waiver authority for this event. See paragraph 4.9.1.4. for
flight surgeon loss of currency.

4. Accomplish upon arrival after each permanent change of station or change in MDS.

5. Flight physicals become due 366 days after the previous physical, and expire after the 455th
day or as indicated on the AF IMT 1042, whichever occurs first. The required frequency may
vary to address waivers and/or individual physical limitations (as determined by the Flight
Surgeon), but in no case will exceed 455 days.

6. AFI 11-2MDS Volume 1 is not the governing directive for completion of this event. IAW AFI
11-202 Volume 1, Paragraph 6, refer to HQ USAF/A3O-AT reference publications for current
ancillary training frequencies. See event description in Chapter 7 for additional information.

7. S-V80-A and S-V80-B establish initial training completion dates for SS02, SS03 and SS06.

8. Flight surgeons must fly at least 50 percent of their annual minimum requirements in primary
unit aircraft unless deployed away from their primary unit for more than 90 days.

9. Flight surgeons may log more than one sortie per day; however, no more than one sortie per
single calendar day will be credited towards semi-annual and annual sortie requirements.

10. A night sortie is one on which either takeoff or landing and at least 50 percent of flight
duration or one hour, whichever is less, occurs during night time, as defined in AFI 11-401.



   4.5.3. Flying Continuation Training Requirements.         Table 4.4 and Table 4.5 list
   continuation training event requirements. See Chapter 7 for event descriptions.
       4.5.3.1. Dual-Seat Qualification. MPD pilots and above are dual-seat qualified. MPD
       pilots and above may fly in either seat with an AC or higher in the other seat as
       designated by the Sq/CC or appropriate ARC Air Operations Officer and appropriately
       annotated on the Flight Authorization (flight orders).
       4.5.3.2. ATD Credit for Training Requirements. Flight events creditable in the ATD are
       listed in Table 4.4 and Table 4.5. For ARMS tracking, simulator events will be logged
       with an "S" prefixed task ID in ARMS. All simulator accomplishments must be
       documented and tracked in ARMS.
       4.5.3.3. Continuation Training Flying. Each MAJCOM provides flying hours to each
       wing as training, test, and ferry hours or operations and maintenance (O&M) hours. The
       hours, based on Aircraft Commander FTL C, are designed to provide all crew positions
       with sufficient hours to accomplish all continuation flying training requirements.
       4.5.3.4. Mission profile simulators (G240, G250) will be flown in the same manner as
       the aircraft, to include the wear and use of professional gear (headsets, helmets, etc.)
           4.5.3.4.1. Simulator sorties will be scheduled as ground events in GDSS (if able) and
           sortie cancellation authority will reside with the OG/CC (or designated
           representative.)
           4.5.3.4.2. Pre-requisites (if required) for simulator training must be completed prior
           to the sim start time or the training will be cancelled.
       4.5.3.5. Units North of the 60 Parallel. OG/CCs are authorized to waive all night
       continuation training events (including currency events) from 1 April through 30
       September. Training events will be prorated for each semi-annual period (See
       paragraph 4.8).
           4.5.3.5.1. Any crewmember who is current for night training events as of 1 April will
           remain current through 30 September. Any crewmember non-current for these events
           prior to 1 April will remain non-current until accomplishing the event with an
           instructor.

        4.5.3.6. Airdrop Proficiency and Currency Requirements. Pilots may take credit
        concurrently for an airdrop and other events as defined by event descriptions in Chapter
        7. Loadmasters may take credit when actual load or personnel are loaded and rigged, all
        checklists through the run-in checklist are accomplished, and the no-drop condition is not
        caused by the loadmaster.

AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                  45


4.6. Flight Surgeon Continuation Training Flying Requirements. Flight Surgeons will
comply with the requirements of this volume and AFI 11-202, Volume 1. Flight surgeons
require one sortie in any qualified MDS every 60 days. See AFI 11-202, Volume 1 table for
flying continuation training requirements. See Table 4.3 for flight surgeon continuation training
requirements.
   4.6.1. Any flight surgeon logging time in this MDS as a secondary airframe, or any AMC-
   assigned flight surgeon logging time in any DoD or foreign military aircraft in which they are
   granted authorization to fly by the local unit, must be on Aeronautical Orders assigning ASC
   8A status and be current in their periodic flight physical and physiological training. The AC
   or their designated crewmember must also give FS a briefing on oxygen equipment and
   egress procedures prior to flight. NOTE: Initial Qualification requirements (in Chapters 2
   and 3) only apply to the Flight Surgeon's primary aircraft.
       4.6.1.1. For contingency/AOR missions, Flight Surgeons must also be current in the
       following events (in their primary aircraft): SS02, SS03, SS20 (S-V80-A), and G120.
4.7. Additional Ancillary Training. Ancillary Training is any guidance or instruction that
contributes to mission accomplishment, but is separate from an Air Force Specialty or
occupational series. Some ancillary training does not impact mission ready status or mobility
status. AFI 11-2C-130J Volume 1 is not the governing directive for completion of ancillary
training events. Individuals are responsible for completing additional ancillary ground
training requirements as specified in AFI 36-2201 and other applicable instructions. In
accordance with AFI 11-202 Volume 1, the source AFI provides training frequency for these
events unless an approved waiver has been authorized. See Unit Deployment Manager to ensure
compliance with additional non-aircrew specific training requirements.
4.8. Proration of Training. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 describes proration of training requirements
for crewmembers not available for flying duties. In addition, prorate training for non-availability
due to contingency alerts and contingency flying temporary duty (TDY) when the contingency
precludes training for certain mission events (PACAF and USAFE: also contingency operations
from home station). This authority will be used judiciously, especially when prorating the same
crewmember for consecutive semi-annual training periods.
   4.8.1. Use this formula to determine training requirements: number of months available
   times the event volume divided by the number of months in the training period. Round down
   to the nearest whole number, but not less than 1 (e.g. 5.6 rounds to 5).
       4.8.1.1. Use Table 4.6 to determine the number of months available. Prorate only if
       absence is at least 15 cumulative days.
       4.8.1.2. When an individual permanently changes station (PCS) during the training cycle
       to a unit flying the same MDS aircraft and enters the same FTL or lower, credit training
       accomplished at the previous base. Prorate training requirements based on the time
       available (e.g., time at former base, plus time at new base, minus number of days not
       available) during the training period. Time available starts 7-days after sign-in for the
       Continental United States (CONUS) and 14-days after sign-in for outside the continental
       United States (OCONUS) or on the date of actual accomplishment of the first training
       event, whichever occurs first. Subtract previous accomplishments from the prorated total
       to determine remaining requirements.
 46                                                      AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012


   4.8.2. Units may also prorate requirements for individuals changing training levels.        If
   requirements are prorated do not credit events accomplished while in the former FTL.

4.9. Failure to Complete Training Requirements. Declare individuals NMR if they fail to
maintain flying currency, fail to complete semi-annual flying continuation training requirements,
or fail to complete ground continuation training requirements. The following guidance applies:
   4.9.1. Loss of Currency. Flight currency is associated with those events denoted in the
   flying continuation training tables by a specific period of time (monthly, quarterly, semi-
   annual, or annually) within which an event will be accomplished (listed in the â€•CURâ€–
   column). Loss of currency prohibits an individual from accomplishing unsupervised in-flight
   duties in the non-current event(s).
       4.9.1.1. Place individuals delinquent in one or more currency events in supervised
       training status for that event and declare them NMR. Loss of currency prohibits an
       individual from accomplishing unsupervised in-flight duties in the non-current event(s).
       4.9.1.2. Crewmembers are non-current the day after event currency expires (i.e., a
       crewmember that accomplished an event with monthly currency on 1 May becomes non-
       current on 1 July).
       4.9.1.3. Sq/CC will direct training necessary for the individual to regain MR status (See
       paragraph 4.9.4.2) or request an OG/CC waiver for the requirement (See paragraph
       1.5.7). Base the decision to approve a waiver on the individual crewmemberâ€™s experience
       and proficiency level. Do not approve a waiver request for the same flying training event
       deficiency affecting consecutive training periods (if a waiver is desired for consecutive
       training periods, forward request for MAJCOM approval).
       4.9.1.4. Flight Surgeon loss of flying currency. Units will notify the MAJCOM
       Command Surgeon of Flight Surgeons exceeding 60-days between sorties (AMC units
       send notification to AMC/SGP and local MDG/CC). Flight surgeons that exceed 60 days
       between sorties require a review of aircraft exits and oxygen systems conducted by a
       member of the flight crew designated by the Aircraft Commander (AC) prior to the flight
       to regain flying currency.
           4.9.1.4.1. The egress review will be signed off by the AC on a copy of the AMC/SGP
           memo or other approved form (e.g., AF 1522, locally generated form/memo, etc.)
           Note: documentation on AFTO 781 is not acceptable. The Flight surgeon must
           submit this documentation to the local Squadron/Host Aviation Resource Manager
AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                              47


         (SARM/HARM) office after the flight or upon return to home station if the flight is in
         conjunction with a TDY. The HARM or SARM will place the documentation in the
         flight surgeonâ€™s training folder.
         4.9.1.4.2. Failure to complete and document required training before the flight will
         result in the loss of ability to log primary flight surgeon time.
         4.9.1.4.3. Flight Surgeons that exceed 6-months between sorties require completion
         of LL03, Emergency Egress Training, Non-Ejection Seat, with a certified aircrew
         instructor prior to the next flight.
  4.9.2. Failure to Complete Semi-annual Flying Training Events. At the end of each training
  period, the Sq/CC will review ARMS products for crewmembers that fail to accomplish all
  required flying continuation training. Failure to complete semi-annual requirements
  prohibits an individual from accomplishing unsupervised in-flight duties in the specific
  event(s).
     4.9.2.1. Place individuals delinquent in one or more currency events in supervised
     training status for that event and declare them NMR in unit missions requiring the event.
     4.9.2.2. Sq/CC will direct training necessary for the individual to regain MR status using
     the same process as regaining currency (See paragraph 4.9.4.2) or request an OG/CC
     waiver for the requirement (See paragraph 1.5.7). Base the decision to approve a waiver
     on the crewmemberâ€™s experience and proficiency level. Do not approve a waiver request
     for the same flying training event deficiency affecting two consecutive training periods
     (if a waiver is desired for two consecutive training periods, forward request to MAJCOM
     approval).
  4.9.3. Failure to Complete Ground Training Events.
     4.9.3.1. Failure to complete Ground Continuation training events in Table 4.1 leads to
     NMR status. NMR status prohibits an individual from accomplishing unsupervised in-
     flight duties until the delinquent event is accomplished or waived.
     4.9.3.2. Failure to complete Mobility Training events in Table 4.2 does not affect MR
     status but restricts crewmembers from performing missions that require the delinquent
     event(s) until the required training is accomplished.
     4.9.3.3. If a Flight Surgeon fails to complete Ground Continuation Training events in
     Table 4.3, the Sq/CC (or his designated representative) will determine the Flight
     Surgeonâ€™s status based on mission requirements.
     4.9.3.4. With the exception of mandatory grounding items in Table 4.1, the OG/CC may
     waive certain ground continuation training events identified in Table 4.1 and Table 4.2
     This waiver extends the due date and does not delete the requirement. This waiver
     authority will be used judiciously. The decision to grant a waiver will be based on the
     individual crewmemberâ€™s experience and proficiency level. OG/CC will determine the
     allowable time period of the waiver. The make-up training should be accomplished at the
     earliest opportunity. This waiver is for unforeseen circumstances only and only for events
     that will not degrade mission accomplishment.
     4.9.3.5. With the exception of mandatory grounding items, SQ/CC (or their designated
     representative) may allow crewmembers NMR for events in Table 4.1 to fly
 48                                                      AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012


       unsupervised on training missions as long as the crewmembers do not accomplish the
       specific event(s) that put them into NMR training status. An individual NMR for failure
       to complete NVG Ground Refresher Training (NV03) may fly unsupervised on any
       mission not requiring the overdue event with SQ/CC (or designated representative)
       approval. An individual NMR for failure to complete Hazardous Cargo Training (G182)
       may only fly unsupervised on local training missions not requiring the overdue event
       with SQ/CC (or their designated representative) approval.

Table 4.7. NMR Flying Restrictions.
                NMR DUE TO                                          RESULT

 NVG assault events                             Restricted from NVG assault events
 NVG VLL event (Note 3)                         Restricted from NVG VLL event
 NVG ground operation events (loadmaster)       Restricted from NVG ground operations
 Airdrop events (Note 4)                        Restricted from airdrop events
 Tactical arrival and departure events          Restricted from tactical arrivals and departures
 Miscellaneous events (see Tables 4.4 & 4.5)    No restriction
 NOTES:
 1. Includes all Proficiency/Basic events listed in Table 4.4 and Table 4.5. See NVG items for
 NVG restrictions. (Example: NMR due to landing requires instructor supervision for any
 landing. NMR due to NVG Landing restricts NVG landings but does not affect unaided
 landings). Only includes Category 1 Navigation Sortie if planned for the mission. If not
 planned, crewmembers are restricted from performing those events, but they may fly without
 instructor supervision. Pilots NMR due to unaided night events may fly unsupervised on local
 training day missions as long as they are not also delinquent due to corresponding day events
 planned for the mission. If a loadmaster is NMR due to M050, Tactical Mission, the
 crewmember may still fly a Proficiency Sortie as long as no mission events requiring a tactical
 checklist are planned or flown.
 2. Includes formation departure and recovery events. Does not include airdrop.
 3. Unaided night VLL events are no longer required or practiced. See AFTTP 3-3.C-130J
 and/or AFI 11-2C-130J, Volume 3.
 4. Airdrop events may be divided into equipment, personnel, Container Delivery System (CDS)
 or JPADS/I-CDS airdrop events. For example, a loadmaster may be NMR due to a personnel
 drop, but that does not affect equipment or CDS if not delinquent in those events. For pilots,
 PADS Operator NMR status does not affect other airdrop events.
AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                 49


   4.9.4. Crewmembers NMR for Flying Training Events.
      4.9.4.1. NMR crewmembers may fly unsupervised on CONUS and OCONUS missions
      if events in the delinquent category are not accomplished (OG/CC approval not required
      for local, routine, and non-contingency missions). Use Table 4.7 as a guide. NOTE: An
      individual non-current in takeoffs (P020), landings (P190), or approaches (P070), will not
      fly unsupervised on any sortie (See paragraph 1.10).
      4.9.4.2. Regaining Currency or Mission-Ready Status.
          4.9.4.2.1. Non-current or NMR for up to 6-months, a crewmember will demonstrate
          proficiency in the aircraft or simulator (as appropriate as defined in Table 4.4 or
          Table 4.5) with an Air Force instructor (or ATS instructor of like specialty for
          simulator creditable events) in all delinquent items. Crewmembers non-current for
          less than 6-months will maintain their current training level (no training folder
          required).
          4.9.4.2.2. Non-current or NMR exceeding 6-months. For events identified in Table
          4.4 and Table 4.5, the crewmember is unqualified in the aircraft and will complete
          Sq/CC-directed requalification training and an aircrew evaluation according to AFI
          11-2C-130J Volume 2 (see Table 4.7, Note 1 for clarification and exceptions). If
          NMR due to Assault, Visual Low-Level, SKE, or Airdrop events exceeding six
          months, the aircrew member is unqualified or uncertified in the appropriate mission
          event and will complete requalification or recertification as directed in paragraph 2.9.
          (Exception: Flight evaluation not required if event only requires certification). Use
          Table 4.7 as a guide for grouping events. NMR due to NVG events does not affect
          the unaided event (e.g., NMR due to NVG Landing does not affect Landing).
          Crewmembers will regain NVG currency by flying with an instructor for the
          particular NVG event. NMR due to Miscellaneous Flying Training Events exceeding
          six months requires proficiency to be demonstrated in the aircraft, WST or verbally
          debriefed (except for P280, Aircrew Chemical Defense Task Qualification Training
          (ACDTQT)) to the satisfaction of a like-position qualified instructor in all delinquent
          items.
4.10. Requirements Before PCS or TDY by Rated Members on Active Flying Status. AFI
11-202, Volume 1 specifies requirements before PCS or TDY.
4.11. Requirements Before Removal From Active Flying Status. AFI 11-202, Volume 1
specifies requirements before removal from active flying.
4.12. Requirements While in Inactive Flying Status. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 specifies
requirements while in inactive flying status.
4.13. Retraining. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 specifies retraining restriction before separation,
retirement, or mandatory inactive flying status.
4.14. Aircrew Flying in Non-US Air Force Aircraft and with Non-US Air Force Units. AFI
11-202, Volume 1 addresses individuals flying in this status.
4.15. Training Period. Continuation training program is based on static 6-month periods (1
January â€“ 30 June and 1 July â€“ 31 December). MAJCOMs may adjust training periods based on
unique mission requirements.

                                  UPGRADE TRAINING

5.1. Description. This chapter identifies general prerequisites and training requirements for
upgrade.
   5.1.1. General. The flying time prerequisites for upgrade are based on the crewmember
   having gained the knowledge and judgment required to effectively accomplish the unitâ€™s
   missions. Sq/CCs will ensure their continuation training programs emphasize these areas.
   Crewmembers will have an in-depth knowledge of systems, procedures, and instructions
   before entering the formal upgrade program.
   5.1.2. OG/CC is designated waiver authority for minimum flying hour prerequisites for entry
   into formal upgrade courses (see Table 5.1).

 NOTES:
 1. C-130E/H cross-flow pilots will have 50 total C-130J hours (not including â€•otherâ€– time)
 prior to certification to aircraft commander. All other cross-flow pilots will have 100 total C-
 130J hours (not including â€•otherâ€– time) prior to certification to aircraft commander.
 2. ML will have a X1A251 primary AFSC (or higher).
 3. Airdrop qualified ML will have a minimum of 15 actual aerial delivery sorties of which a
 minimum of 10 will be some combination of actual equipment or CDS events.
 4. C-130J simulator time is creditable towards PAA Time. Simulator time is creditable
 towards total flying hours.
 5. Total flying hours represents all flying time logged aboard a fixed wing aircraft as a
 â€•militaryâ€– pilot including UPT, Student, and â€•Otherâ€– time (but does not include time in
 another aircrew specialty).
 6. Any qualified candidate may be trained using a TX course for IQT/MQT at the gaining unit
 commanderâ€™s or appropriate AFRC/ANG supervisorâ€™s discretion. Comply with ETCA and the
 course syllabus.
 7. Refer all Rotary Wing pilots to MAJCOM/A3T for a training recommendation.
 8. For MAF crossflow with similar skill set (i.e., C-17, C-5, etc.), MPD Phase II guide is not
 required. Pilots with dissimilar background (i.e., OSA/FAIP, F-16, etc.), accomplish MPD
 Phase II guide in-unit.


5.2. Mobility Pilot Development (MPD). Mobility Pilot Development is the development
program leading to Aircraft Commander certification. The MPD program flows from Pilot
Initial Qualification (PIQ) or Aircraft Commander Initial Qualification (ACIQ) formal training
courses through continuation training to upgrade selection and culminates in certification as an
Aircraft Commander. MPD continuation training is divided into three phases: MPD Phase I
(V280), MPD Phase II (V281), and MPD Phase III. All MPD pilots will be dual-seat qualified
and maintain qualification requirements according to AFI 11-2C-130J Volume 2. MPD pilots
are not Aircraft Commanders. See minimum flying hour requirements in Table 5.1.
   5.2.1. The success of this program depends on MPD pilots being mentored and provided
   with development opportunities. The upgrade training timeline to Aircraft Commander is
   based on performance and at the discretion of the Sq/CC, it should be tailored to match an
   individualâ€™s capabilities and experience level.
5.3. MPD Continuation Training thru Aircraft Commander Upgrade.
   5.3.1. Documentation. Completion of MPD Phase I and II is documented in ARMS as V280
   and V281 respectively; GRACC is documented in ARMS as V282. Document the
   completion of the entire course via AF Form 4324 and Sq/CC certification.
   5.3.2. Training Guides. MPD Phase I & II guides are available for download on the
   AMC/A3T CoP. Guides should be carried on all sorties to maximize training opportunities.
52                                                      AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012


  5.3.3. MPD Phase I (V280). After completion of the PIQ course, pilots enter Phase I of
  continuation training. This first phase consists of completing the MPD Phase I guide, which
  focuses on core aircraft abilities including communication, checklist discipline, systems
  knowledge, and basic mission planning. A Phase I MPD should not have additional
  squadron duties nor be expected to act as an Aircraft Commander, yet they should observe
  and learn from their aircrew leadership.
     5.3.3.1. During this stage of pilot development, a Phase I MPD pilot is restricted to the
     right seat and may only occupy the aircraft left seat with an IP. Phase I MPD pilots will
     train in the right seat during refresher sims and may occupy the left or right seats for
     proficiency sims (and available proficiency time at the end of a refresher sim). Phase I
     MPD pilots will complete the MPD Phase I guide NLT 180 days (365 days for ARC)
     after becoming mission ready.
     5.3.3.2. In order to advance beyond Phase I, the Phase I MPD pilot must be at least 6
     months from the training start date (as defined in 1.7.1), have a minimum of 200 PAA
     (aircraft) hours, and have completed the MPD Phase I guide. Once these requirements
     are met, the Phase I MPD pilot may be approved for Phase II via the STRP. (Note: MPD
     pilots who were Mission Ready prior to the release of this AFI may continue under the
     previous             GRACC              workbook            for           up         to
     6 months beyond the release date of this AFI at Sq/CC discretion, but will comply with
     all other requirements in this paragraph). For FAIP/OSA or non-mobility weapon system
     pilots transitioning to MAF aircraft, completion of V280 is not required; however, V281
     and V282 are required.
  5.3.4. MPD Phase II (V281). This phase consists of completing the MPD Phase II guide,
  which focuses on the core tasks of flying skills, mission situational awareness, and crew
  management required for Aircraft Commander certification.
     5.3.4.1. Training in this stage will ensure a balanced exposure to both left and right seats
     in the aircraft with an AC or above. Good judgment and Operational Risk Management
     (ORM) will dictate with whom they fly and what seat they occupy. As Phase II MPD
     pilots advance in knowledge, they are encouraged to practice actual mission management
     skills and decision making under the guidance of their AC or IP.
     5.3.4.2. MPD Selection for Aircraft Commander Upgrade/Certification. Phase II MPD
     pilots must meet pre-requisites defined in Table 5.1 as well as complete the MPD Phase
     II guide. Based upon performance, experience, and requisite flight hours, Phase II MPD
     pilots will be identified for upgrade by squadron leadership via the STRP. MPD pilots
     require a minimum of one AF Form 8 evaluation after FP mission ready certification and
     prior to entry into Aircraft Commander upgrade (N/A for MAF crossflow, FAIP/OSA, or
     non- mobility weapon system pilots).
     5.3.4.3. AMC Orientation Tour / GRACC (V282). This event provides an in-depth look
     at selected AMC and 618 AOC (TACC) operations as well as an opportunity to interact
     with command senior staff. Ideally, this course should be completed by Aircraft
     Commander candidates after completing V281, but before beginning formal Aircraft
     Commander upgrade training (ACU). GRACC is mandatory for AMC pilots and highly
     encouraged for PACAF, USAFE, AFRC, and ANG mobility forces pilots upgrading to
     Aircraft Commander. GRACC is transferable between all mobility weapon systems. For
AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                     53


        AMC pilots, V282 will be completed prior to Aircraft Commander certification. If
        unable to complete V282 prior to certification, units may schedule attendance up to 90
        days after certification; beyond 90 days requires OG/CC approval. See paragraph 1.18
        for scheduling details.          Additional information is available via ETCA:
        https://etca.randolph.af.mil/showcourse.asp?as_course_id=GRACC.
   5.3.5. MPD Phase III. Aircraft Commander Upgrade (ACU). After the Sq/CC determines
   (via the STRP) an upgrade training start date, training time begins and the upgrade candidate
   will begin applicable ACU training events, as required (see Table 1.2 for in-unit training
   time limitations). Prior to starting training, the training office will open and maintain an AF
   Form 4022 or Electronic Gradebook (EGB) until the upgrade candidate is certified as an
   Aircraft Commander. Units using multiple folders to document a pilots training progress
   may combine those into a single training folder at the unitâ€™s discretion. Training guides are
   authorized.
        5.3.5.1. Current and qualified Aircraft Commander candidates accomplishing MPD
        Phase III training events require IP supervision during non-critical phases of flight and
        direct IP supervision during critical phases of flight. Two Aircraft Commander
        candidates may sit in the left and right seats under IP supervision in the simulator, as
        required.
        5.3.5.2. The Aircraft Commander candidate will accomplish the following requirements
        prior to the Aircraft Commander Review and Certification (R&C) Board:
            5.3.5.2.1. Aircraft Commander candidates must be current in applicable Mission
            Certification Training events listed in Tables 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3. prior to certification.
   5.3.6. Evaluation and Certification. Accomplish an Operational Mission Evaluation (OME)
   according to AFI 11-2C-130J Volume 2, if required. ACU culminates with a Sq/CCâ€™s R&C
   Board recommendation.

5.4. Aircrew Instructor Program. This course is designed to teach selected crewmembers
fundamentals and concepts of instructing. Instructor candidates will be selected based on
experience, judgment, ability to instruct, flying skill, and technical knowledge.
   5.4.1. For instructor upgrade prerequisites, see Table 5.1.
   5.4.2. All instructor candidates will demonstrate to a flight examiner their ability to instruct
   and perform selected maneuvers and items according to applicable directives.
   5.4.3. Instructor candidates will be mission-ready in their unitâ€™s mission. Formation airdrop
   pilots will be Flight Lead certified. With OG/CC approval, former instructor pilots going
   through in-unit requalification may accomplish lead certification in conjunction with
   instructor requalification. SQ/CC can direct training requirements for previous formation
   airdrop Flight Lead certified pilots.
   5.4.4. For ground and flight training requirements, all initial aircrew instructor candidates
   will complete training on the principles of instruction at the appropriate formal school.
        5.4.4.1. Initial instructor candidates will attend the formal C-130J instructor course.
        Waivers will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by MAJCOM/A3T if formal school
        course slots are not available.
AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                  55


     5.4.4.2. All initial instructor candidates who attend the FTU will complete the
     Preparatory Course before formal instructor upgrade training. Aircraft commanders
     should demonstrate aptitude in all IP maneuvers. Courseware is available from the
     MATS contractor. Initial instructor candidates who upgrade in-unit will complete the
     associated Preparatory Course academic courseware, but do not need to complete any
     Preparatory Course flying requirements.
  5.4.5. Instructor candidates who previously attended a formal instructor course for instructor
  qualification and were certified in any US Air Force aircraft as an instructor may upgrade in-
  unit without completing the MATS course. In-unit instructor upgrades require OG/CC
  approval. MAJCOM waivers are not required. Unit commanders determine training
  required to complete upgrade. The upgrade program will culminate in an Initial Instructor
  evaluation (INIT INSTR) IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2. Unit commanders may require prior
  instructors to attend the formal course. Refer to Table 1.2 for in-unit training time limits.
  5.4.6. Instructor Responsibilities:
     5.4.6.1. An AF instructor shall be a competent subject matter expert adept in the
     methodology of instruction. The instructor shall be proficient in evaluating, diagnosing,
     and critiquing student performance, identifying learning objectives and difficulties, and
     prescribing and conducting remedial instruction. The instructor must be able to conduct
     platform and in-flight instruction.
     5.4.6.2. Instructors are responsible to provide thorough preflight briefings, post-flight
     debriefings, and critiques. Instructors will comply with requirements of mission
     outlines, as appropriate, for the type mission being flown.
     5.4.6.3. Instructors will review each traineeâ€™s training record prior to performing each
     training flight or session.
     5.4.6.4. Instructors will ensure all required upgrade training items are completed, signed
     off, and proficiency demonstrated IAW AFI 11-2C-130J, Volume 2 grading requirements
     before recommending trainee for evaluation or certifying the student as qualified in a
     tactic or mission.
     5.4.6.5. Instructor Pilots. Instructor pilots shall be fully aware they are in command of
     the aircraft on training flights and are responsible at all times for flight conduct and
     aircraft safety. Should the traineeâ€™s judgment or proficiency at the controls raise a
     question in the instructorâ€™s mind as to the traineeâ€™s ability to safely complete a prescribed
     maneuver at any time during the flight, the instructor will immediately assume aircraft
     control. The instructor should then explain and demonstrate proper tactics, techniques,
     and procedures for the maneuver prior to the trainee resuming control of the aircraft. All
     instructors will place special emphasis on procedures for positively identifying
     emergency conditions before initiating corrective action.
     5.4.6.6. Instructor Loadmasters. Responsibility for safely executing duties of their
     position will be emphasized to each aircrew member. Should the judgment or proficiency
     of the trainee raise a question in the instructorâ€™s mind as to the traineeâ€™s ability to safely
     execute the duties of the aircrew position at any time during the flight, the instructor will
     immediately takeover those duties. The instructor should then explain and demonstrate
     the proper method of executing those duties prior to the trainee resuming duties.

5.5. Flight Examiner Certification.
   5.5.1. Flight Examiners. Sq/CC will recommend instructors for flight examiner certification.
   Instructors identified for certification as flight examiner will possess satisfactory knowledge
   of training and evaluation policies and procedures and the ability to administer evaluations
   according to applicable publications.
   5.5.2. Flight examiner candidates will complete the MATS flight examiner course for their
   crew position. Squadron commanders may waive this requirement if the candidate is a
   previously qualified flight examiner in any USAF aircraft. Flight examiner candidates
   should:
       5.5.2.1. Observe qualified evaluators conducting a cross-section of evaluations, to
       include techniques used to evaluate aircraft systems and flight directive knowledge.
       5.5.2.2. Receive a briefing on command policies and interpretations of AFI 11-202,
       Volume 1, AFI 11-202, Volume 2, AFI 11-2C-130J, Volumes 1 and 2 and MAJCOM
       supplements.
5.6. Formation/Flight Lead Certification. This section prescribes the prerequisites,
qualifications, and training requirements necessary for upgrade to lead multi-element formations
for aircraft commanders. Accomplish the upgrade training in-unit using AMC developed
syllabus                  on                 the                AMC/A3T                    CoP:
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/EntryCoP.asp?Filter=OO-OP-AM-81. Graduates of a
FTU mission qualification course are 2-ship formation lead certified.
   5.6.1. Prerequisites. Commanders should select highly qualified mission ready aircraft
   commanders for formation/flight lead. Do not use flying hour totals alone as a measure of
   experience. Put more weight on leadership abilities, knowledge of tactics, techniques, and
   procedures, systems and procedural knowledge, ability to adapt to rapidly changing
   situations, and skill at operating in day visual, SKE, and NVG formations in the low-level,
   aerial delivery, and assault operations environments.
   5.6.2. Ground Training Requirements. Design flight lead training to prepare an aircraft
   commander for the following responsibilities: flight and deputy lead, element lead, mission
   commander, combat mission planning, and execution.
   5.6.3. Flying Training. The primary responsibility of a formation lead is to lead the
   formation through a variety of situations to an objective. Place emphasis for in-flight
   training on course and time control, communications, formation requirements, wingman
   consideration, tactical formation maneuvering, formation tactical departures and arrivals,
   adaptability to changing scenario, and reaction to threats. As a minimum:
       5.6.3.1. Fly in the flight lead position for both visual and instrument (SKE) operations.
       Fly in the element lead position for both visual and instrument (SKE) operations. The
       instructor will ensure that the candidate has the opportunity to respond to a variety of in-
       flight changes such as threat avoidance, weather avoidance, command-and-control
       directed-diverts, changing user requirements, loss of escort or drop zone (DZ) support,
       and time slips. Use of all secure communications and electronic combat systems is
       essential in lead upgrade flying training. Emphasis should be on nuances of how to be a
       flight and element lead in a multi-element formation versus the number of run-ins.
AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                 57


       5.6.3.2. The flight lead candidate should brief and debrief each training mission.
5.7. Night Vision Goggle (NVG) Training. NVGs are standard for night tactical operations in
the C-130J. The primary method for NVG training is during initial FTU qualification. Units
may complete NVG training (including assaults) in-unit as a part of the AETC mission transition
course.
   5.7.1. NVG Conversion Training â€“ If a crewmember is NVG certified and the unit, or
   crewmember, converts to a different type NVG, then academic training is required. Use the
   AFRL academic training program to cover the operation and features of the other model
   NVGs and NVG testers. Any flight training is at the discretion of the unit commander.
5.8. Phoenix Banner Certification. Squadron commanders and operations officers will ensure
that crew members chosen for these missions are certified IAW paragraph 5.8.1 and highly
capable. Selection should be based on qualification, proficiency, experience, maturity, and
mission complexity.
   5.8.1. Units will establish and maintain Phoenix Banner training programs. As a minimum,
   training will consist of an instructor-led in-depth review of AFI 11-289, Phoenix Banner,
   Silver, and Copper Operation, discussion of tasking and execution agencies for Phoenix
   Banner missions, and how the aircrew will interface with these agencies. Furthermore, the
   program will address the personnel to coordinate with, in case of diversion or delay,
   including the presidential Advance Agent, US Secret Service, HMX-1 representative. The
   goal of training is to educate crewmembers on the requirements for these
   individuals/agencies and illustrate their ability to help accomplish the mission. Following the
   review, an open book examination of AFI 11-289, minimum 80 percent, corrected to 100
   percent will be accomplished. Before commanding a Phoenix Banner, Silver, or Copper
   mission, aircraft commanders require squadron commander certification IAW AFI 11-289.
5.9. Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS) Certification.
   5.9.1. The JPADS training program is designed for all crew positions. This program allows
   MAF combat delivery aircrews to improve airdrop accuracy during high altitude airdrop
   employment utilizing the PADS mission planner and JPADS. Improved CDS (I-CDS) and
   JPADS operations are conducted using the UHF Dropsonde Receiver, GPS-retransmission
   link equipment and PADS Mission Planner (PADS-MP) laptop and software. I-CDS
   operations use standard-rigged CDS loads with non-steerable chutes; JPADS operations are
   conducted using steerable chutes with Airborne Guidance Units (AGU). For both types of
   airdrop, the PADS MP laptop will be used to determine a more precise airdrop release point
   or launch acceptability region (LAR). Crews will use AMC-provided checklists and mission
   planning guides during training and employment. Crews will comply with all requirements
   of AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations.        NOTE: Sq/CC will determine
   training requirements for previously certified I-CDS/JPADS qualified pilots and loadmasters.
   5.9.2. JPADS Airdrop: This training is designed to allow single/multiple ship I-CDS or
   JPADS operations using low, medium, or high altitude procedures. JPADS airdrop training
   is accomplished with the PADS mission planner and either normal ballistic loads or JPADS
   guided loads depending on availability. When ballistic loads (i.e., I-CDS) are used in lieu of
   JPADS guided loads, an in-flight wireless update will be completed to a static AGU for
   training prior to the drop. Airdropping actual JPADS guided systems is intended for
 58                                                      AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012


   significant training events and exercises, not normal recurring or initial training. Due to
   limited training assets, commanders should use discretion when scheduling JPADS airdrops.
   5.9.3. ICDS and JPADS certification and currency. ICDS and JPADS certification will be
   completed in accordance with the JPADS training syllabus and guide. JPADS PADS
   operator (PO) mobile training team (MTT) instructors must be an IP, but are not required to
   be qualified in the MDS (e.g., a certified C-130J IP may perform PADS operator primary or
   instructional duties on a C-130E/H). For non-MDS qualified crew members, log other time
   with crew duty position as XP. Crewmembers who previously completed the interim JPADS
   training syllabus are considered JPADS certified. All crewmembers will complete Phase I
   training. Phase I Pilots will receive a JPADS certification, but will not require any
   continuation training. In addition, crewmembers performing PADS Operator (PO) or
   loadmaster (LM) duties will complete Phase II qualification training, and require
   continuation training. PO qualification includes I-CDS and JPADS drop operations. If a
   unit/Mobile Training Team does not have access to syllabus-required training equipment,
   instructors will, with unit CC/DO concurrence, determine if a PO student has received
   sufficient instruction for certification. All simulated events must be verbally debriefed. For
   example, if a unit has Dropsondes but no AGU, consider the PO syllabus Wireless Transfer
   Event complete if the student imports Dropsonde data and simulates Wireless AGU Data
   Transfer. LM certification is split into I-CDS (Phase I) and JPADS operations (Phase II).
   LMâ€™s that do not complete hands-on AGU training will be certified as Phase I only until
   JPADS Phase II training is complete.
   5.9.4. Upon completion of applicable training, crewmembers are considered JPADS/I-CDS
   qualified/certified or I-CDS-only certified as described in 5.9.3. Units may document Phase I
   training on AF FORM 1522, ARMS Additional Training Accomplishment Report for non-PO
   pilots. Use ARMS event identifiers Q502 â€•JPADS/I-CDS certificationâ€– for non-PO certified
   pilots, Q521 â€•JPADS Phase Iâ€– for I-CDS/non-guided certified loadmasters, and Q522
   â€•JPADS Phase 2â€– for PADS Operator certified crewmembers and JPADS certified
   loadmasters.
   5.9.5. The PADS Operator (PO) is defined as any JPADS Phase II certified rated officer.
   Normally this consists of an additional pilot, but may also be a PADS Operator from another
   airframe (e.g., C-130E/H, C-17). For the purposes of non-current PADS Operators who need
   an instructor, like specialty is not required (e.g., a navigator PADS Operator may instruct a
   pilot PADS Operator on events AD11 or AD12).
5.10. Unimproved Landing Certification. Pilots will be trained and certified by an instructor
on unimproved airfields using assault procedures. Unimproved airfields are airfields where
runway acquisition and ground operations are complicated by blowing snow, sand, or dirt;
undulating terrain, or minimum runway lighting or markings. Only affects MR status for
missions requiring unimproved field landings. Units will record and track this training. Aircraft
commanders and above previously certified for unimproved landings in the C-130 E/H do not
require recertification in the C-130J.
5.11. Functional Check Flight (FCF) Certification. AFI 11-2C-130J, Volume 3 outlines FCF
requirements. FCF pilots will be selected from highly qualified instructors. The candidate will
complete a review of applicable technical orders. The pilot candidate will fly as the PM on a
AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                               59


minimum of one FCF prior to unit commander certification in order to ensure proficiency in
running the FCF checklists
5.12. Touch and Go Landing Certification. Pilots receive touch and go training (day and
NVG) as part of initial qualification at the FTU. They may be touch and go certified by the unit
commander once AC upgrade is complete. See AFI 11-2C-130J, Volume 3, chapter 9 for touch
and go restrictions.
5.13. Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System (MAFFS). The MAFFS mission is a joint
mission performed by ANG, AFRC, and US Forest Service (USFS) personnel as a partnership
with USFS as the lead federal agency. The term MAFFS is used as a generic term which
includes both MAFFS (legacy) and MAFFS II. This section establishes the continuation training
requirements for a MAFFS certified C-130 crewmember.        In addition, MAFFS Instructor
certification guidance is included. OG/CCs of MAFFS units may provide additional guidance or
clarification in local training procedures. MAJCOM/A3T approval is required if changing policy
or guidance in paragraph 5.13 or its subparagraphs.
   5.13.1. Requirements.
       5.13.1.1. MAFFS syllabus changes and updates will be forwarded to NGB/A3O for
       coordination. NGB/A3O will maintain the master files and approve syllabus changes.
       Final syllabus approval is NGB/A3 with informational copies sent to AMC/A3T.
       5.13.1.2. Conduct MAFFS Certification for Pilots and Loadmasters IAW approved
       training syllabus. Upon completion of training, as detailed in this instruction and the
       syllabus, crewmembers will be certified for MAFFS missions. Flight evaluations are not
       required to certify MAFFS aircrew.
   5.13.2. Approval/Waiver for MAFFS Certification. The MAFFS unitâ€™s OG/CC, through the
   squadron TRP is the approval authority for MAFFS Certification. The MAFFS unitâ€™s OG/CC
   is the waiver authority for MAFFS aircrew continuation training requirements.
   5.13.3. Time Period for Mission Certification Training. There is no specified training time
   limit due to the availability of the MAFFS training program conducted by the US Forest
   Service.
   5.13.4. MAFFS Training Prerequisites. For all crew positions, the crewmembers will be
   highly qualified C-130 Mission Ready crewmembers who are airdrop qualified. Pilots will
   be formation and visual low level qualified. Crewmembers must have the availability to
   complete the required training and respond to mission tasking during the wildfire season.
   Aircrew will be designated by the OG/CC for course entry.
   5.13.5. MAFFS Initial Training. Accomplish ground and flight training under the
   supervision of a MAFFS instructor. All training will be conducted IAW the approved
   MAFFS Syllabus and training guides during the training session in coordination with the
   USFS, at a location determined by the USFS. A flight evaluation is not required. Upon
   successful completion of all required training items, instructors will nominate the
   crewmember for certification. Once certified, crewmembers will be allowed to perform
   MAFFS mission duties in their crew position.
       5.13.5.1. Instructors. MAFFS instructor candidates will be selected from among the most
       qualified Instructors and will be experienced in all phases of MAFFS flying operations,
60                                                        AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012


     including actual wild fire airdrops. Prior to certifying instructors to teach MAFFS, they
     will receive training that will include ground and flight certification requirements under
     the supervision of a MAFFS instructor. OG/CCs should provide additional guidance and
     specific requirements for instructor certification.
  5.13.6. Continuation Training. This section outlines ground and flying continuation training
  requirements for MAFFS certified Pilots and Loadmasters. MAFFS continuation training
  will be accomplished during an annually scheduled training session conducted by the
  individual operational MAFFS unit or in coordination with USFS at their biennially provided
  training event. If a crewmember does not attend a training session, they are considered non-
  current and may regain currency on an actual fire under the direct supervision of a MAFFS
  instructor. If a crewmember loses airdrop qualification, they will also lose MAFFS
  certification until qualification is regained. In addition, if Pilots lose formation or visual low
  level qualification, they will also lose MAFFS certification until qualification is regained.
     5.13.6.1. USFS Certification. A MAFFS Instructor will supervise all MAFFS ground and
     flying continuation training. MAFFS Sq/CCs or OG/CCs will certify individual
     crewmember qualifications to the USFS upon successful completion of all required
     training items.
     5.13.6.2. Continuation Training Requirements. MAFFS currency duration shall be based
     on the annual MAFFS training program. Due to the frequently changing available
     training opportunities throughout the training year, ARMS is not ideally suited to track
     ground or flying continuation training events. Units may develop X coded events for
     these purposes, but it is not required. Training accomplishment will be documented IAW
     paragraph 5.13.6.1.
     5.13.6.3. Ground Training. Accomplish ground training IAW Table 5.3.
     5.13.6.4. Flight Training. Accomplish annual flying training IAW Table 5.4.

   5.13.7. Recertification Training Requirements
      5.13.7.1. Pilots and loadmasters normally regain MAFFS currency by completing the
      annually scheduled training session conducted by the individual operational MAFFS unit
      or in coordination with USFS at their biennially provided training event. If a member
      does not complete the annual continuation training, they may regain currency on a wild

      fire activation. However, the individual will be under direct supervision of a MAFFS
      instructor and the currency training will be coordinated with the Expeditionary Aerospace
      Squadron-Wildland Firefighting Commander (EAS-WFF/CC). If an individual misses
      two scheduled annual MAFFS training programs and remains non-current, that individual
      will regain currency by completing retraining as directed by the home-station Sq/CC.
5.14. ILS Precision Runway Monitoring (PRM) Certification Training.
   5.14.1. AFI 11-202 Volume 3 requires aircrews operating aircraft equipped with dual VHF
   radios and TCAS to receive one-time training for operations at airports with ILS PRM
   approaches. The Sq/CC or designated representative will certify pilots upon completion of
   one-time training. Document certification as ILS PRM-Certified, ARMS event identifier is
   Q017, ILS PRM. Before operations at an airport with ILS PRM approaches capabilities,
   pilots will complete the following training and certification. See AFI 11-2C-130J Volume 3
   for more information.
   5.14.2. Training Program. Review ILS PRM requirements according to the Airman's
   Information Manual, Part 5-4-15. Complete appropriate training including viewing of the
   video.     The      most     current    information      can      be     viewed      at:
   http://www.faa.gov/education_research/training/prm.
   5.14.3. View FAA video, "ILS PRM Approach Information for Air Carrier Pilots" available
   for down load. The large-file video is also available on the AMC/A3T CoP at:
   https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-OP-AM-81.
5.15. Low Cost/Low Altitude (LCLA) Certification.
   5.15.1. The LCLA training program is designed for all crew positions. This program
   certifies MAF combat delivery aircrews to conduct non-standard DZ operations using LCLA
   airdrop procedures. Crews will comply with all requirements of AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and
   Landing Zone Operations.
   5.15.2. Training Program. AATTC at St. Joseph, MO, is the MAF LCLA training lead.
   Units tasked to deploy LCLA-trained crews will schedule a Mobile Training Team (MTT)
   through AATTC to establish an initial cadre. If an MTT cannot be scheduled prior to
   deployment, OG/CCs will select highly experienced instructors from each crew position to
   serve as the unitâ€™s initial cadre. OG/CCs will gain approval from MAJCOM/A3T IAW
   waiver procedures outlined in paragraph 1.5 when exercising the non-MTT training option.
   The selected individuals will complete a thorough review of all available LCLA guidance
   and perform all events listed in paragraph 7.14 (with no events waived). Once certified, unit
   initial cadre will train remaining unit crewmembers.
      5.15.2.1. Prior Trained Crewmembers. Units with previously trained crewmembers
      (trained at AATTC, by a MTT, or utilizing the exception in paragraph 5.9.2) may be
      certified without any additional training. Crewmembers who are already instructor
      certified and LCLA certified may be used to train additional crewmembers.
   5.15.3. Certification. LCLA is one-time training for all crew positions. Units may document
   training on AF FORM 1522, ARMS Additional Training Accomplishment Report, upon
   completion. Units will certify crewmembers and track in ARMS using code Q517 â€•Low
   Cost/Low Altitude (LCLA) Certificationâ€–. Semi-annual continuation training for LCLA

        C-130J MAINTENANCE AND AIRCREW TRAINING SYSTEM (MATS)

6.1. Description. MATS is a civilian contractor-provided maintenance and aircrew training
system. The MATS contractor provides academic and simulator training. The Air Force
conducts all actual flight training and administers all evaluations. The MATS contract
guarantees trained students meet government standards.
6.2. Applicability. As defined in AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
   6.2.1. Purpose: MATS is a system of academics, ATD sessions, and ground training. This
   system provides qualification, upgrade, and continuation training to attain and maintain
   appropriate qualification for C-130J crewmembers and maintenance engine run technicians.
   The MATS contractor provides training courseware and all academic and ATD instruction.
   6.2.2. Goal. The goal of the MATS program is to optimize aircrew training through the
   integrated use of academics, ATD, and static aircraft instruction. These objectives should be
   included within the statement of work for such support as well as means for evaluation and
   approval of course content, standards, and media.
6.3. Dedicated Training Time. As defined in AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
   6.3.1. Applies to formal school and continuation training. It is imperative that students
   complete training in a timely and uninterrupted manner. Students will enroll on a full-time
   basis. Relieve students of duties not directly related to training. EXCEPTION: Senior
   Officer Course (SOC) students may continue their normal duties as time permits.
6.4. MATS Course Prerequisites. MATS course prerequisites are listed in Table 5.1, the
Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA, https://etca.randolph.af.mil/), and the
appropriate syllabus (https://aetc_uft.randolph.af.mil/bookstore/). Each MATS course is
designed and based on student prerequisites being met. Prerequisites may include a minimum
number of flying hours, squadron operations officer recommendation, and completion of
applicable courseware.
6.5. Lesson Objectives: Instructors and evaluators use lesson objectives as a reference
document to establish training and evaluation standards.
   6.5.1. Master Task List (MTL) and Standards of Evaluation (SOE) Purpose: MTL and SOE
   provide the basis for MATS courseware development, and are a principle source for
   evaluation criteria (validate crewmember performance).
       6.5.1.1. Courseware developers, flight examiners, and instructors who evaluate or train
       C-130J crewmembers should use criteria in the MTL and SOE to help determine the
       ability of an individual to meet performance levels required to be mission-qualified. For
       evaluation, use AFI 11-2C-130J, Volume 2 criteria.
       6.5.1.2. Conduct the Air Force evaluation to SOE standards, in a timely manner
       subsequent to the traineeâ€™s completion of the ground-based or flight training (to guarantee
       standards).
AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                 65


   6.5.2. CRM Training. CRM is the effective use of all available resourcesâ€”people, weapon
   systems, facilities, equipment, and environmentâ€”by individuals or crews to safely and
   efficiently accomplish an assigned mission or task. CRM is presented on a recurring basis
   throughout MATS. Introduction to CRM is presented during initial qualification training
   (IQT) and is imbedded in recurring phase training.
6.6. Unsatisfactory Student Progress. If a student's training progress is unsatisfactory,
notification to the government representative (wing training, operations officer, etc), will occur
according to the contract. Following review of the student's record, the government
representative will determine whether to continue or terminate training. See formal course
syllabus or MAJCOM policy for further guidance.
   6.6.1. The contractor will provide feedback (per the contract) to the unit commander or
   training office for students who display substandard performance.
   6.6.2. Remediation Procedures. Notify MATS contractor and COR within 24 hours of a
   failed flight evaluation following a MATS course. Remediation subsequent to a failed flight
   evaluation may be the MATS contractorâ€™s responsibility, Air Forceâ€™s responsibility, or a joint
   responsibility, depending on the nature of failure. In every case, close coordination is
   required to achieve maximum trainee progress. Direct contact with appropriate MATS
   instructor supervisor is encouraged.
       6.6.2.1. Remediation Scheduling:
           6.6.2.1.1. When a trainee is required to return for remediation regarding deficient
           areas, the traineeâ€™s unit, appropriate wing or group training office, and MATS
           training manager will coordinate training start and completion dates.
           6.6.2.1.2. The MATS contractor will notify the government (per the contract) when
           identifying a trainee who requires remediation or additional training. Air Force will
           review MATS contractor documentation and recommendations regarding trainee
           performance. Air Force will determine whether or not to continue any further
           training for that trainee, using MATS instruction, or otherwise terminate all training.
6.7. Courseware Changes. Changes to MATS courseware, including MTL and SOE, may be
proposed by any C-130J crewmember. Complete recommended change on MATS contractorâ€™s
change proposal form and submit to the local COR. Change proposals will be sent through
wing/group training or COR offices to 714 TRS/TRT at Little Rock AFB. 714 TRS/TRT will
coordinate with the MATS contractor and the originator and will provide feedback to reflect
action taken. Contractor proposal forms are available from MATS contractor training manager
at each site.
6.8. Scheduling:
   6.8.1. General. Local procedures will be developed at each main operating base (MOB) for
   scheduling MATS trainees. MOB wing or group training offices will ensure procedures
   minimize schedule changes and turbulence.
   6.8.2. Enrollment. Enrollment for all MATS courses (upgrade and continuation) will be
   accomplished through the MOB wing or group training office (appropriate ARC chain-of-
   command for ARC upgrades). Each active duty wing and group training office will establish
   procedures to accommodate ARC unit training requirements. Names and other personal data
66                                                     AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012


  required by MATS contractor will be passed to their scheduler not later than the time
  established by host wing or group training office.
  6.8.3. Class Surging. Class surging will be coordinated between MAJCOMs due to
  relationships of the many MATS resources. Refer to the MATS contract class capacity
  allowances.
  6.8.4. Class Size. Annual throughput for specific MATS courses is established in the MATS
  contract. The AETC PFT document reflects formal school throughput based on Air Force
  requirements and what is authorized by contract. If the contract throughput for any MOB
  (formal school or otherwise) will be exceeded, AMC/A3T will coordinate those requirements
  through appropriate Air Force and MATS contractor channels. In conjunction with their
  COR office, wing or group training offices will monitor annual throughput (current or
  projected) according to their MOB MATS authorized throughput and notify AMC/A3T of
  differences either above or below what is authorized in the contract.
     6.8.4.1. Every attempt will be made by MOB wing or group training office to ensure all
     classes are filled before requesting secondary method.
     6.8.4.2. MATS training at alternate sites. The MATS contractor determines the required
     number of MATS instructors and resources needed to accommodate annual throughput.
     Projected annual throughput is based on Air Force manpower data, which includes
     assigned, on-loan, and attached active duty as well as designated ARC and other units
     specified to be trained at that MOB. Trainee scheduling at a particular MOB should be
     kept within the units designated for that MOB. If a unit is unable to complete their
     requirements at a designated site, units may receive training at another site with prior
     coordination between the unit and the site.
  6.8.5. Cancellations. Deletions from the MATS schedule will vary at each training site
  because of training courses offered and the impact to scheduling. Continued cancellations
  will greatly impact the overall annual training plan, and the contractor may be unable to
  accommodate the original, planned throughput.
     6.8.5.1. Cancellation procedures will be developed at each MOB between contractor and
     wing training.
     6.8.5.2. Cancellation for MATS formal school courses. Units will notify HQ
     AETC/A3R 45-days before a formal school start date if a course allocation cancellation
     or no-fill is pending. This suspense should enable the class quota to be reallocated.
     Formal school cancellations will be made not later than 30-days before class start date,
     due to the impact of scheduling changes on the PFT. EXCEPTION: Emergency leave.
     HQ AETC/A3R will remove quotas and either reallocate or cancel affected quota or
     class.
  6.8.6. Wing Option Time. MATS contractor is required to provide Air Force use of training
  equipment at each site. Amount of time varies by site. Use of this time is prioritized within
  the contract.
  6.8.7. MATS Course Pre-Work. MATS courses may require trainee preparation before class
  start. If required, the pre-work is an integral portion of the course and will be accomplished
  to receive course completion credit. Pre-work may consist of reviewing study references,
AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                 67


   quizzes, performance data preparation, workbooks, etc. Required pre-work is described in
   the appropriate student training guide. Failure to complete the pre-work will disrupt the
   scheduled training and, in some cases, may result in dismissal from the course.
   6.8.8. Late or No-Show. Course completion credit may be withheld when trainee tardiness
   interferes with class training. While MATS contractor personnel are not required to
   substitute for missing or late crewmembers, contractor personnel may fill a crew position per
   existing contractor / government agreements.
6.9. Administration:
   6.9.1. MATS Feedback
      6.9.1.1. The COR is the liaison between the Administrative Contracting
      Officer/Procuring Contracting Officer (ACO/PCO) and the MATS contractor. CORs are
      empowered to evaluate any component of contract compliance. These individuals are
      entrusted with quality assurance, are the only appropriate office (unit-level) to direct
      contractor to perform or stop work via the ACO/PCO's direction, and are accountable for
      these actions. Each wing or group commander will establish MATS COR positions and
      enforce directives, requirements, and procedures established by Department of Defense
      (DoD) and MAJCOM directives and publications. MATS CORs will maintain a current
      copy of the MATS contract(s), designated quality assurance regulations and directives,
      and quality assurance procedures.
      6.9.1.2. Operational Evaluation. The MATS contractor is required to evaluate the
      MATS program and its graduatesâ€™ on-the-job performance as stated in the contract.
      6.9.1.3. Feedback includes inputs from graduates, flight commanders (or designated
      representatives), and evaluators. Analysis of actual performance (Air Force evaluation)
      and trainee critique data help to determine if graduatesâ€™ on-the-job performance meets
      MTL and established performance standards. The importance of this on-the-job
      performance feedback from graduates, flight commanders, and evaluators cannot be
      overemphasized. This data is vital to establishing a database to identify trends and
      support revisions to the MATS.
   6.9.2. MATS Data Collection. Internal and external data will be collected, reported, and
   corrective actions taken according to approved operation evaluation plan.
6.10. Aircraft Flights for MATS Training Instructors.
   6.10.1. Air Force Flight Instructor Observations. The MATS contractor may provide
   opportunities for Air Force flight instructors to observe trainee progress in ATDs (if provided
   within the contract). Likewise, MATS instructors may observe the trainee's aircraft flights, if
   in the contract. Every reasonable effort should be made to ensure this type of interface
   continues at each training site.
   6.10.2. Contractor Personnel Flight Operations. If contract specifies, MATS instructors may
   observe USAF flights IAW AFI 11-401 and contract requirements.
6.11. MATS Facility Tours.
   6.11.1. Wing training offices will coordinate all requests for MATS facility tours with the
   contractor as soon as possible, but in no case later than 24-hours before the planned event.
68                                                    AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012


  This may require close coordination with public affairs and protocol. Air Force option time
  may be used at the discretion of the OG/CC. Tours will be on an as-available basis and will
  not displace scheduled training events.
  6.11.2. OG/CC will ensure an Air Force representative meets, greets, accompanies, and
  conducts all tours. The contractor is not manned for or on contract to perform these duties.
  The contractor shall be responsible for providing an aircrew training device operator only.

7.3. USAF-Specified Training Events.
   7.3.1. AA01 Qualification Evaluation
       7.3.1.1. Purpose: All C-130J aircrew will complete a periodic qualification evaluation in
       the C-130J, to include requisites, as specified by AFI 11-2C-130J, Volume 2.
       7.3.1.2. OPR: AMC/A3V
   7.3.2. AA11 Instrument Evaluation
       7.3.2.1. Purpose: All C-130J Air Force pilots (and other pilots flying operationally with
       the Air Force, e.g., exchange pilots) will maintain instrument qualifications.
       7.3.2.2. OPR: AMC/A3V
   7.3.3. AA21 Combined Qualification / Instrument Evaluation
       7.3.3.1. Purpose: All C-130J Air Force pilots (and other pilots flying operationally with
       the Air Force, e.g., exchange pilots) may combine qualification and instrument
       evaluations.
       7.3.3.2. OPR: AMC/A3V
7.4. Airdrop (AD) Events. Log an airdrop event when a successful airdrop is accomplished.
Pilots may log actual loads, training bundles or drogue chute only training drops (DOTD). If a
no-drop condition occurs after the run-in checklist is completed, aircraft commanders will
determine if enough training was accomplished to credit the airdrop for any crew position. See
event descriptions for further guidance. Both pilots may credit the airdrop event.
   7.4.1. Employment Altitudes. Use the following altitude definitions:         NOTE: These
   definitions are separate from the altitude definitions in AFTTP 3-1.GP, which are not
   applicable to C-130 training. In the event of overlap (e.g., more than 10,000' MSL, but less
   than 3000' AGL due to mountainous terrain), use the most logical category for the type of
   airdrop being flown, and procedures being used. See AFI 11-2C-130JV3, AFTTP 3-3.C-
   130J, and AFI 11-231 for additional information on employment altitudes.
       7.4.1.1. Very Low Altitude. Surface to 999' above ground level (AGL). Used for many
       drops.
       7.4.1.2. Low Altitude. 1000' AGL to 2499' AGL. Used for many drops.
       7.4.1.3. Medium Altitude. 2500' AGL to 9,999' MSL. Typically used for I-
       CDS/JPADS, HALO, HAHO, and other types of drops but has no special oxygen
       requirements. See AFI 11-231 for minimum HALO/HAHO altitudes.
       7.4.1.4. High Altitude. 10,000' MSL to 17,999' MSL. Airdrops conducted at these
       altitudes have special oxygen requirements. See AFI 11-202V3 Chapter 6 and AFI 11-
       2C-130JV3 Chapter 19.
       7.4.1.5. Very High Altitude. 18,000' MSL and above. Airdrops conducted at these
       altitudes have special oxygen requirements, including pre-breathing. See AFI 11-202V3
       Chapter 6 and AFI 11-2C-130JV3 Chapter 19.
AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                 71


  7.4.2. AD01 Basic Airdrop Event
     7.4.2.1. Purpose: Continuation training for loadmasters.
     7.4.2.2. Description: See AFTTP 3-3.C-130J and/or AFI 11-2C-130J, Volume 3 for
     airdrop procedures.
     7.4.2.3. OPR: AMC/A3T/A3D
     7.4.2.4. Training Media: Aircraft.
     7.4.2.5. Instructor: Not required for continuation training.
     7.4.2.6. Additional Information: Log this event with any airdrop. In the event of a
     planned or unplanned no-drop condition, the aircraft commander will determine if
     sufficient events were accomplished to credit this event.
  7.4.3. AD03 Equipment / DOTD / SATB-H
     7.4.3.1. Purpose: Continuation training for mission ready pilots and loadmasters.
     7.4.3.2. Description: AFTTP 3-3.C-130J and/or AFI 11-2C-130J, Volume 3 for
     equipment airdrop (including SATB-H) procedures.
     7.4.3.3. OPR: AMC/A3T/A3D
     7.4.3.4. Training Media: Aircraft or WST
     7.4.3.5. Instructor: Not required for continuation training.
     7.4.3.6. Additional Information: Loadmasters log this event when an actual equipment
     load is loaded, rigged, all checklists through the run-in checklist are accomplished, and
     there is not a no-drop condition due to either loadmaster. Pilots may log this event for
     drogue chute only training drops (DOTD) or SATB-H.
  7.4.4. AD04 Containerized Delivery System / SATB-C
     7.4.4.1. Purpose: Continuation training for mission ready crewmembers.
     7.4.4.2. Description: See AFTTP 3-3.C-130J and/or AFI 11-2C-130J, Volume 3 for
     CDS airdrop (including SATB-C) procedures.
     7.4.4.3. OPR: AMC/A3T/A3D
     7.4.4.4. Training Media: Aircraft or WST
     7.4.4.5. Instructor: Not required for continuation training.
     7.4.4.6. Additional Information: Loadmasters log this event when an actual CDS bundle
     is loaded, rigged, all checklists through the run-in checklist are accomplished, and there is
     not a no-drop condition due to either loadmaster.
  7.4.5. AD05 Personnel / SATB-P Airdrop
     7.4.5.1. Purpose: Continuation training for mission ready crewmembers.
     7.4.5.2. Description: See AFTTP 3-3.C-130J and/or AFI 11-2C-130J, Volume 3 for
     personnel airdrop procedures.
     7.4.5.3. OPR: AMC/A3T/A3D
72                                                      AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012


     7.4.5.4. Training Media: Aircraft or WST
     7.4.5.5. Instructor: Not required for continuation training.
     7.4.5.6. Additional Information: Loadmasters log this event only when actual personnel
     are loaded, rigged, all checklists through the run-in checklist are accomplished, and there
     is not a no-drop condition due to either loadmaster.
  7.4.6. AD09 JPADS Medium/High Altitude Airdrop
     7.4.6.1. Purpose: Continuation training for airdrop-qualified crewmembers.
     7.4.6.2. Description: JPADS (guided or unguided) airdrop at medium or high altitude.
     See paragraph 7.4.1 and Attachment 1 for airdrop altitude definitions. Crewmembers
     should attempt to practice this event at the highest practical altitude commensurate with
     DZ size and airspace restrictions. See AFTTP 3-3.C-130J, AFI 11-2C-130JV3, AFI 11-
     231, and AFI 13-217 for medium/high-altitude airdrop procedures and restrictions.
     7.4.6.3. OPR: AMC/A3T/A3D
     7.4.6.4. Training Media: Aircraft or USAF-certified WST.
     7.4.6.5. Instructor: Not required for continuation training.
     7.4.6.6. Additional Information: Crewmembers will perform their airdrop duties while
     on oxygen in order to credit the event, regardless of airdrop altitude flown. If DZ size
     does not permit dropping at or above the minimum for medium altitude, actual airdrop
     may be simulated at medium / high altitude as long as all checklists are completed. If
     local airspace or other restrictions preclude flying the airdrop at medium / high altitudes,
     units may credit this event in the simulator, or accomplish the event at low altitude if no
     other alternative is available. However, the intent is to fly an actual JPADS (guided or
     unguided) airdrop in the aircraft, at or above 10,000' MSL, whenever practical.
  7.4.7. AD10 JPADS (guided) Airdrop
     7.4.7.1. Purpose: Continuation training for JPADS certified loadmasters.
     7.4.7.2. Description: JPADS (guided) airdrop to include flight station and cargo
     compartment configuration JPADS checklists, and JPADS (guided) airdrop to an
     appropriate DZ. Certified loadmasters will drop an actual JPADS (guided) bundle. If DZ
     requirements prevent actual drop, simulate a guided bundle drop through completion of
     the JPADS (guided) airdrop slowdown checklist.
     7.4.7.3. OPR: AMC/A3T/A3D
     7.4.7.4. Training Media: Aircraft
     7.4.7.5. Instructor: Not required for continuation training.
     7.4.7.6. Additional Information: If dropping an actual JPADS guided bundle is not
     practical, loadmasters still require an AGU rigged on a bundle aboard the aircraft to
     simulate all necessary checklist steps. Loadmasters may credit the event if all checklists
     through slowdown are complete.
  7.4.8. AD11 PADS Operator Unguided Airdrop.
     7.4.8.1. Purpose: Continuation training for PO certified mission-ready pilots.
AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012                                                                73


       7.4.8.2. Description: I-CDS (JPADS unguided) airdrop to include mission planning,
       JPADS computer preflight and in-flight actions, flight station and cargo compartment
       configuration, JPADS checklists, dropsonde release/monitoring, airdrop damage
       estimate, and I-CDS airdrop to an appropriate DZ. Crews will comply with all
       requirements of AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations. The I-CDS
       airdrop is considered complete with successful deployment of the dropsonde(s), update of
       the release point via PADS computer and airdrop of the bundle. There is no minimum
       altitude for this event when accomplished in the aircraft, other than the minimum altitude
       to release a dropsonde, though realistic AFTTP 3-3.C-130J altitudes should be used to the
       maximum extent possible based on airspace and DZ restrictions.
       7.4.8.3. In the event that the dropsonde(s) was (were) deployed but insufficient
       dropsonde data was gathered to update the release point with the PADS computer, the
       crew will make all reasonable attempts to troubleshoot the problem, to include
       completion of the I-CDS/JPADS troubleshooting guide. If these procedures fail to
       correct the problem, then at the discretion of the aircraft commander, the event can still
       be considered complete if the crew successfully airdrops the bundle by completing the I-
       CDS/JPADS to Conventional Quick Transition Checklist, and performing a racetrack/re-
       attack using conventional ballistic CDS procedures.
       7.4.8.4. OPR: AMC/A3T/A3D
       7.4.8.5. Training Media: Aircraft or USAF-certified WST.
       7.4.8.6. Instructor: Not required for continuation training.
       7.4.8.7. Additional Information: Must perform all PO duties to credit the event. POs
       may credit this event in any MDS. POs may not log this event while occupying either
       pilot's seat. May dual log with AD04, AD09 and AD12 (in any combination) if all
       requirements of each of the respective events are met. If performing PO duties in a
       different MDS, POs will only log AD11.
   7.4.9. AD12 PADS Operator Guided Airdrop.
       7.4.9.1. Purpose: Continuation training for PO certified mission-ready pilots.
7.4.9.2. Description: JPADS airdrop to include mission planning, JPADS computer preflight and
in-flight actions, flight station and cargo compartment configuration, JPADS checklists, airdrop
damage estimate, and guided system airdrop. Crews will comply with all requirements of AFI
13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations. The guided system airdrop is considered
complete with update of the release point and launch acceptability region (LAR) using the
JPADS computer (with or without dropsonde data), wireless transfer to the AGU, and
completion of all checklists through the slowdown checklist. If equipment and DZs are
available, 50% of AD12 events must end in actual guided airdrop. Minimum altitudes for actual
guided airdrops are IAW specific requirements of each guided system and AFI 13-217.
7.4.9.3. OPR: AMC/A3T/A3D
       7.4.9.4. Training Media: Aircraft or USAF-certified WST.
       7.4.9.5. Instructor: Not required for continuation training.

     7.13.10.6. Additional Information: Non-directional beacons are a type of non-precision
     navigation aids used during IFR operations to guide the aircraft to a safe landing. Since
     NDBs are not usually co-located with distance measuring equipment, positional
     awareness can only usually be gained through a combination of crew coordination, NDB
     station passage, cross-tuning, timing, radar, and other navigation aids. Because of these
     factors and others, a higher than normal degree of crew coordination is required for many
     NDB approaches. See the flight manual, AFI 11-2C-130J, Volume 3, AFI 11-202,
     Volume 3, and AFI 11-217, Volumes 2 and 3 for additional information. Will be dual

7.21. Visual Threat Recognition and Avoidance Trainer (VTRAT) Training (VT)
Events. VTRAT is a training device designed to introduce or refresh scanners on their duties
during an anti-aircraft threat engagement. The visual simulation displays realistic visual
characteristics of anti-aircraft weaponry such as missile fly-out and AAA rate-of-fire, as seen
from the scannerâ€™s viewpoint in the aircraft. Instruction in VTRAT is delivered in the context of
flight over a simulated threat environment. The student views this environment on a high-
resolution 67â€– display system, from the perspective of his/her duty position. The student hears
the instructional text through a headset, and interacts with the trainer via a voice recognition
system, as well as the communication and flares countermeasures controls available on the real-
world aircraft. VTRAT diagnoses weak areas of student performance and emphasizes training in
these areas until mastery of the specific threat protocol is achieved. OG/CC is waiver authority
for VTRAT training.

                       AIRCREW TRAINING DOCUMENTATION

A2.1. General Information. This attachment provides guidelines on proper training
documentation. Electronic Grade Book (EGB) documentation is the primary method for
documenting aircrew training. FTUs and units will use the Training Management System EGB
in lieu of paper AF Form 4022, Aircrew Training Folder, AF Form 4023, Aircrew Training
Progress Report, AF Form 4024, Aircrew Training Accomplishment Report, and AF Form 4025,
Aircrew       Summary/Close-out     Report.       EGB     instructions   are    provided     at
https://MATS.littlerock.af.mil. Units transitioning to the EGB will transcribe the information
in the traditional AF Form 4022, AF Form 4023, AF Form 4024, and AF Form 4025 from paper
training folders that are currently open into the EGB. Paper training folders that have been
closed-out will continue to comply with paragraph A2.5.2. The following paragraphs apply to
the EGB or the previously approved paper training folders. AMC/A3TA and Det 3, AMCAOS
at Little Rock AFB are the POCs and liaison with the MATS contractor for EGB changes and
recommendations. Coordinate all recommended changes through MAJCOM to AMC/A3TA and
Det 3 AMCAOS.
   A2.1.1. Initiate a training folder (AF Form 4022) for ETCA formal training courses (formal
   school or in-unit), mission certification, special qualification, certification training, in-unit
   upgrade program to the next higher crew qualification, requalification training (formal school
   or in-unit), and all corrective action or additional training. If the training can be
   accomplished on one mission, a training folder is not required.
       A2.1.1.1. The unit operations officer may waive the training folder requirement if
       corrective action or additional training is limited. If initiated, the instructor or flight
       examiner who evaluated the aircrew member's performance will enter comments
       pertinent to the training deficiency on AF Form 4023 or the training guide. Use the
       existing AF Form 4022 for end-of-course evaluations that result in additional training.
       A2.1.1.2. For a crewmember undergoing more than one training program in a short
       period of time the unit may combine all training into one AF Form 4022; e.g., an
       experienced C-130 aircraft commander returning to fly may have his or her Unit
       Indoctrination and applicable airland or mission qualification training, formation lead
       training, and instructor re-qualification training combined in one folder.
   A2.1.2. Access to Training Records. Squadrons will maintain training folders for their
   personnel in a location readily accessible at all times to instructors and supervisory
   personnel. Students may review their folder(s) during normal duty hours.
       A2.1.2.1. Web-based EGB provides world-wide access to instructors and supervisory
       personnel. Instructors, Aircraft Commanders, training office personnel, Ops Officers and
       Commanders may obtain access through the MATS contractorâ€™s portal. Contact the local
       MATS contractor site manager for access.
   A2.1.3. Instructor Procedures. The instructor or trainer will review the training folder, to
   include AF Forms 4023 and 4024 or the training guide, prior to all training periods. Those
   areas not previously accomplished or those, in which crewmembers require additional
   training, will be noted for possible inclusion during the current training period.
 130                                                    AFI11-2C-130JV1 21 AUGUST 2012


   A2.1.4. Training Folder Review. Operations officers will review active training folders
   quarterly, and flight commanders or squadron training representatives will conduct a monthly
   review. Monthly and quarterly reviews will be annotated on AF Form 4023 or in the training
   guide.
   A2.1.5. Completion of Training.           Upon completion of formal training leading to
   qualification (whether accomplished at the FTU or in-unit), an AF Form 4025 will be placed
   in the individual's training folder, as specified in the MAJCOM supplement. See paragraph
   A2.5.1.
       A2.1.5.1. Formal School Disposition of Training Records. Formal schools will send the
       original AF Form 4022 with all training records to the student's gaining unit within ten
       working days of the studentâ€™s graduation or departure. Sq/CC or designated
       representative will review formal school training records and enter appropriate comments
       on the training guide progress record or AF Form 4023.
       A2.1.5.2. Specific to PACAF and USAFE. After one year, training offices will retain
       the AF Form 4025 in the crewmemberâ€™s Permanent Training Record. Refer to the Air
       Force      Records       Disposition     Schedule       (RDS)         located    at
       https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm, for further guidance.
       A2.1.5.3. Disposition of Training Records. All squadron training offices that do not
       maintain Permanent Training Records will retain all AF Forms 4022 contents until one
       year after training close out and then return them to the crewmember. Training records
       maintained in the EGB will be accessible for review through the MATS website. No unit
       will insert AF Forms 4022, 4023, or 4024 or training guides into FEFs. Refer to the Air
