law, executive orders, higher headquarters (HHQ) directives (e.g., DoD, JCS, AFI, AFMAN, etc.) and
MAJCOM publications. Additionally, this C&SRL supports guidance in the United States Code (USC),
the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and HHQ directives and publications related to managing the mil-
itary and civilian equal opportunity programs. The references in this directory are for informational pur-
poses only and are not all-inclusive. This publication applies to all ACC commanders, managers and

nity and Equal Employment Opportunity Programs. It also applies to Air National Guard (ANG) units and
personnel when published in ANG Master Catalog located at https://airguard.ang.af.mil/angpubs2/
ppg. This publication does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units and personnel. Units
may supplement this publication to add internal compliance items. Send comments and suggested

1. General.
   1.1. Compliance and Standardization Requirements Lists (C&SRL) are the primary products used
   during the ACC Inspector General (HQ ACC/IG) Unit Compliance Inspection (UCI) to assess unit
   compliance with established guidance governing each particular area of operations. Items contained in
   this C&SRL are defined by the ACC staff and based upon existing “by-law” requirements, Executive
   Orders, DoD directives, AF and ACC guidance, and mission areas deemed critical by AF or ACC
2                                                                         ACCDIR90-254 5 APRIL 2006


    leadership to assessing and assuring unit organizational health and/or performance. The objective of
    the C&SRL is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required capabilities.
    1.2. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCO) represent the highest priority of inspection items and are
    fundamentally derived from the Common Core Compliance Areas (CCCA) and the fourteen mission
    areas defined in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities. Lower tier core and general compliance
    items may be stand alone or subordinate to a CCO. During the UCI, it is the intent of the ACC IG to
    inspect as a minimum 100% of the CCOs that apply to the inspected unit. However, C&SRL items
    listed do not limit the scope of the inspection. Critical, core and general compliance criteria are
    defined as follows:
       1.2.1. Critical Compliance Objective (CCO). An item where a unit failure to comply with
       established guidance could result in significant liabilities, loss of life or serious injury or signifi-
       cant mission impact. Key mission areas are:
               - Airman development programs
               - Ability to deploy forces
               - Ability to employ forces
       CCOs are shown in BOLD AND ALL CAPS FORMAT.
       1.2.2. Core Compliance Item (CCI). An item or area that requires special vigilance and is
       important to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed "Critical." Non-compliance
       would result in some negative impact on mission performance or could result in injury or possible
       litigations. CCIs are shown in ALL CAPS FORMAT.
       1.2.3. General Compliance Item (GCI). An item or area deemed fundamental to successful
       overall performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in minimal impact on mission
       accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury or possible litigation. GCIs are shown in
       sentence case format.
    1.3. Compliance Items Applicability to ANG Units. This C&SRL only applies to ANG units once
    posted on the ANG Master Publications Web Site. Additionally, those items designated with an aster-
    isks (*) do not apply to ANG units and members and will be exempt from inspection during the UCI.
