This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 16-7, Special Actions Programs
and AFI 16-701, Management, Administration and Oversight of AF Special Access Programs. It
establishes responsibilities for oversight of Special Access Programs (SAPs) within the Air Force
Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Agency (AFISRA). This instruction applies
to all AFISRA military, government civilian personnel, contractors and consultants when
contract performance depends on access to SAPs, Non-DoD US Government Agencies whose
personnel, by mutual agreement, require access to SAPs. The AFISRA Primary Subordinate
Units (PSUs) are Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC), National Air and Space
Intelligence Center (NASIC), 70th ISR Wing (ISRW), 480 ISRW and 361st ISR Group (ISRG).
This publication also applies to AFISRA-gained/attached Air National Guard (ANG) and Air
Force Reserve Command (AFRC) organizations. Refer recommended changes and questions
about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through the
appropriate functional’s chain of command. Maintain records created as a result of the
prescribed processes identified in this directory in accordance with (IAW) AFMAN 33-363,
Management of Records, and dispose of them IAW the AF Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
found on the Air Force Portal link at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

1. General. AFISRA, as the provider of Air Force ISR forces, has significant participation in
and contributions to U.S. Government (USG) special access programs. AFISRA provides forces
and capabilities to accomplish Planning, Collection, Processing, Analysis, and Dissemination of
intelligence from SAP sensors. AFISRA also ensures SAP weapon systems are provided all
intelligence required for development, planning and operations. To accomplish these tasks, the
AFISRA/CC approves and directs all Agency participation in SAP activities.
2. Purpose. The purpose of this instruction is threefold. First, it ensures appropriate individuals
are accessed to programs while protecting extremely sensitive information. Second, it allows the
commander to prioritize Agency efforts to maximize accomplishment of all assigned missions
and requirements. Third, it allows the commander to provide the required oversight of the
expenditure of resources from multiple programs while ensuring compliance with different
statutory authorities/requirements for uniquely funded ISR operations.
3. Scope. This instruction applies to all AFISRA units and organizations. For the purposes of
this instruction, SAP refers to any USG program that requires restricted access beyond the
standard classification system and the Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) system.
These include all categories of SAPs (acquisition, operations and support, and intelligence), as
well as those programs managed by other DoD or USG entities. Also included are Alternative
Compensatory Control Measures (ACCM) systems, AF COAL WARFIGHTER (CW) and Joint
Staff Focal Point (FP) programs, and the Integrated Joint Special Technical Operations (IJSTO)
Control systems.
4. Applicability. This instruction specifically excludes those situations where the Agency has
no explicit program responsibilities (e.g., security, resource oversight, operations, etc.).
However, this exclusion does not imply that Agency members may participate in sensitive
operations without explicit Agency approval, even if those operations are protected in another
agency’s SAP.
5. Responsibilities
