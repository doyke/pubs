AIR FORCE F-35 FIN (TAIL#) POSSESSION REPORTING PROCEDURES

A5.1. BLUF: Fin number can be used to designate F-35 assignment/possession.

A5.2. AFI 21-103 currently dictates assignment/possession reporting requirements for assets at
the base, depot, MAJCOM, and HQ AFMC levels. Within the current construct, the F-35 JSF
program does not provide information to facilitate this requirement. According to AFI 21-103,
the possessing organization is required to report the hours they possess an aerospace vehicle,
changes in an aerospace vehicles assignment/possession, status conditions that affect an
aerospace vehicle’s ability to perform assigned mission, flying hours, and sorties. This
document is a proposal for F-35 specific aircraft identifiers that assist Air Force personnel in
accomplishing the required reporting. The F-35 community will call for Aerospace Vehicle
Distribution Officers (AVDOs) to operate under different business practices than in legacy
systems, though their main role will remain the same. The AVDO will remain the primary POC
for any aircraft assignment/possession reporting within their organization. The ALIS
administrators will make changes to FIN field in ALIS based on input from the AVDO.

A5.3. There are three data elements associated with identifying aircraft in ALIS:

A5.3.1. Unique Aircraft Identifier (UAI): 40 Character field. Lockheed Martin designated
unique identifier also known as the specific Type Variant Effectivity (TVE) as defined in JSF
Program Directive 30. This number never changes for an aircraft. This is like the VIN for a car;
it will never change for the life of the aircraft.

A5.3.2. Bureau Number: 10 Character field. Unique ID reserved and assigned per aircraft at
time of ordering, and is the identifier used by the service. This number never changes for an
aircraft. It is comparable to a legacy aircraft’s serial number which is assigned during the
acquisition process.

A5.3.3. Fin Number: 40 Character field. Identifier assigned by a squadron to an aircraft. This
number can change for an aircraft as it is reassigned from squadron to squadron or as a squadron
sees fit. This is similar to a legacy aircraft tail number. There are no program requirements that
dictate how the fin number is assigned.

A5.4. AVDO transactions with the F-35 are best accomplished by modifying the fin number
field in the aircraft records. In the AF fin number, we will reserve 30 of the 40 available
characters. When assigning a fin number units would include the following information:




A5.4.1. Date/Time stamp: 9 character date/time indicator

A5.4.1.1. Date/time that the new fin number is applicable.
A5.4.1.2. 5 character date in Julian format

A5.4.1.3. 4 character time (GMT)

A5.4.2. Change indicator: 1 character indicator

A5.4.2.1. N – new transaction; No need to over-write previous data

A5.4.2.2. D – Delete the matching transaction; the system will delete the “N” transaction that
matches the entry in this transaction. A follow-on transaction with a CI of “N” will provide the
correct information.

A5.4.3. Assigned Command: 2 character command code as identified in attachment 2

A5.4.4. Assigned Unit: 9 character unit as identified on the DD form 250

A5.4.4.1. 4 character number (i.e. 0033)

A5.4.4.2. 3 character kind (i.e. FTR)

A5.4.4.3. 2 character type (i.e. WG)

A5.4.5. Possession Code (Purpose Identifier Code): 2 character identifier as identified in
Attachment 1 and prescribed in AFI 21-103 attachment 17 (dated 9 April 10).

A5.4.6. Last 7 of UAI: 7 characters of the UAI. This part of the fin number should never
change so that all other information can be referenced back to the same aircraft.

A5.5. Just as AF AVDOs currently have procedures when processing a change in a weapon
system’s possession, the JSF community would need guidance. Sample AVDO responsibilities
could include (but are not limited to) the following steps:

A5.5.1. Primary and alternate AVDO appointed by WG/GP CC. Notification of appointment
made to the appropriate MAJCOM AVDO.

A5.5.2. Monitor MIS daily to ensure proper assignment/possession data is reported.

A5.5.3. Initiate modification to the fin number when the assignment/possession changes.

A5.5.4. Initiate correction to the fin number and historical data when corrupt
assignment/possession data is discovered.

A5.5.4.1. Assignment/possession data error correcting needs attention. There are times that
“backing out” data will be necessary. Our information system needs to facilitate this
requirement. An AVDO at either base or MAJCOM level needs to have authority to facilitate
changes to possession in the data warehouse.

A5.5.5. Notify the ALIS administrators of change in fin number to ensure IER with updated
information is transmitted to the data warehouse.

A5.5.6. Send required messages to the Lead Commands as prescribed in AFI 21-103 2.5.2.6.

A5.6. Input of the fin number assignment must be limited to the appointed AVDO to ensure
integrity of the data warehouse.

A5.7. OPR for any issues adhering to this guidance (including but not limited to clarification of
policy, technical issues, ALIS administrator support issues) is ACC/A4QJ at DSN 574-4810.

                                           Chapter 1

                     MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY AND POLICY

1.1. Introduction
   1.1.1. Sustainment Operating Instructions (SOIs) are F-35 joint program instructions
   provided by the Joint Program Office (JPO). They have been developed with Service/Partner
   participation and provide information on F-35 unique processes where legacy instructions
   may not be adequate for the given topic. SOIs provide source documentation for Air Force
   policies/instructions related to the F-35 and are referenced throughout this publication. SOI
   language that is applicable to AFI 21-101 has been extracted and inserted into applicable
   areas of this publication.
   1.1.2. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program was developed as a Performance Based
   Logistics (PBL) program. The strategy employs an integrated and affordable performance
   package that is designed to optimize system readiness and reduce the demand on the logistics
   tail of a system. It is intended to meet performance goals through a support structure based
   on long-term performance agreements with clear lines of authority and responsibility.
       1.1.2.1. A PBL concept provides a level of performance rather than managing and
       directing every aspect of the weapon system support. PBL moves the focus from the
       management of parts and suppliers to management of the suppliers responsible for
       delivering required performance. Many of the traditional / legacy aircraft requirements
       identified in AFI 21-101 may not apply to weapon systems purchased and managed IAW
       PBL standards.
   1.1.3. The F-35 is a unique joint services platform that utilizes terminology that differs from
   legacy. For a frame of reference, the following are common terms and their legacy
   equivalent: ALIS=IMDS, JTD=MDS T.O., TCTD=TCTO, AR=AFTO -107 or ETAR,
   MEFL=MESL and LCN=WUC.
1.2. Aircraft and Equipment Readiness
   1.2.1. Management of all F-35 Air Vehicle (AV) Scheduled and Prognostic maintenance
   requirements are performed within the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS).
   Scheduled and Prognostic maintenance is performed IAW Joint Technical Data (JTD), Time
   Compliance Technical Directive (TCTD) and as directed in an Action Request Response
   (ARR). Specific scheduled maintenance requirements are created by using the Health
   Inspection Task (HIT) in Squadron Health Management (SHM) via the ALIS. (See AFI 21-
   101, Paragraph 1.3)
1.3. Maintenance Concept
   1.3.1. Action Requests (AR) are the primary method of problem reporting for the F-35 Air
   System. Refer to paragraph 14.9 to submit ARs to the Autonomic Logistics Global
   Sustainment (ALGS) Operations Center through the ALIS. Additionally, the local OI shall
   include procedures for submitting ARs during periods when the ALIS has connectivity
   outages. SOI 1514.02. (See AFI 21-101, Paragraph 1.4.1)
1.4. Use of Joint Technical Directives (JTD)
 6                AFI21-101_COMBATAIRFORCESUP_ADDENDUM_B 10 October 2012


     1.4.1. Recommend improvements, corrections or additions to Joint Technical Data (JTD) by
     submitting a Joint Technical Data Action Request (JTDAR) to ALGS Operations Center
     through the ALIS for JTD improvements, corrections or additions. The request should be
     clear, concise and provide enough detail to identify the recommendation. Additionally, the
     request should provide a recommended solution if known. The initiator shall recommend a
     JTDAR processing priority of Routine or Expedited Action as applicable. (See AFI 21-101,
     Paragraph 1.6.2.1)
        1.4.1.1. Expedited Action changes to JTD are required when personnel/property hazards,
        safety-of-flight conditions exist or a change that pertains to a procedure that will result in
        a work stoppage or damage to equipment if left uncorrected.
        1.4.1.2. Routine Action changes to JTD are required for all other changes that do not
        meet the Expedited Action criteria.
     1.4.2. Waivers, deviations, improvements, corrections, or additional technical data
     procedures are submitted using an AR to the ALGS Operations Center through the ALIS.
     SOI 1514.02. (See AFI 21-101, Paragraph 1.6.2.3)
1.5. Modification Management. Submit an AR to ALGS Operations Center through the ALIS
for program specific equipment and aircraft modifications. SOI 1514.02. (See AFI 21-101,
Paragraph 1.11)

  14.9.1. Responsibilities.
     14.9.1.1. The CRM tool within the ALIS shall be used to report problems via an AR. All
     ARs raised via CRM shall be transmitted via the Optional and Required Screening Points
     (OSP & RSP). These points screen ARs for accuracy of entries and information as well
     as prevent classified, sensitive or International Trade in Arms (ITAR) information from
     being transmitted. In addition to the ALIS System Permission Request (ASPR), OSP and
     RSP personnel shall be designated in writing to the ALIS administrators by the group
     commander assigned (MXG/CC or OG/CC) based upon squadron. Those units not
     assigned to established groups will be designated by the appropriate site lead or QA
     department.
     14.9.1.2. ARs shall be submitted for reporting actions that require rectification outside
     the capability of the local unit. Examples of such cases are JTD changes, modifications,
     engineering analysis etc. Many of these occasions have specific forms in existing policy
     documents; the AR process will replace these mediums in the F-35 environment.
     14.9.1.3. The AR ―Severity‖ provides an additional level of classification to the AR
     beyond that provided by the category. Severities are ranked as high, medium and low
     with each having its own corresponding impact.
     14.9.1.4. The AR ―Category‖ identifies conditions by relative importance and the
     urgency of the resolution required. Category 1 with severity classification of ―high‖ has
     the most severe consequences, resulting in potentially hazardous condition. ARs must
     provide adequate detail to support the desired category.
     14.9.1.5. To ensure a thorough review prior to submittal, ARs should not be processed as
     initiator, OSP and RSP by the same individual. Exceptions may be made if there are no
     alternative measures available.
  14.9.2. Overall timelines for ARs.
     14.9.2.1. Established timelines will be adhered to in the AR process. These timelines are
     general guidelines for AR initiation. Every level of approval must remain cognizant of
     timelines to prevent undue delay of ARs. Delays must be communicated to the OSP and
     RSP during the AR initiation process.
  14.9.3. AR Submission Process.
     14.9.3.1. Initiator shall:
         14.9.3.1.1. Exhaust all available means of resolution prior to submitting an AR.
         14.9.3.1.2. Inform expeditor or aircraft crew chief of AR requirement.
         14.9.3.1.3. Inform supervision of AR request to be implemented.
         14.9.3.1.4. Ensure detail is added to AR to alleviate vagueness.
         14.9.3.1.5. Include tail number of aircraft if AR is related to an aircraft.
         14.9.3.1.6. Include JTD number if AR is related to JTD.
         14.9.3.1.7. Utilize SOI 1514.02 to ensure correct AR categorization, severity and
         classification.

     14.9.5.1. ARs shall be reviewed at all levels to ensure proper categorization and severity
     is assigned.
     14.9.5.2. Squadron OSP and respective RSP must consider fleet implications when
     preparing ARs for submittal. Depending upon the circumstances for the AR, an AR may
     have an impact on all assigned aircraft/equipment regardless of the squadron assigned.
     Generally, ARs categorized as Category 1 (High, Medium, Low) or Category II (High)
     will fall into this criteria.
     14.9.5.3. If an AR has fleet implications, respective squadron RSP will coordinate with
     additional squadrons to review the potential AR prior to submittal. All affected squadron
     RSPs will review the potential AR for impacts on their unit. Additionally, an AR review
     will be conducted to ensure all information is accurate and the proper category and
     severity has been assigned.

     14.9.7. Leadership review.
        14.9.7.1. It is the RSP’s responsibility to ensure group leadership is notified prior to AR
        submittal. All major maintenance will be coordinated with respective group commander
        or their designated representative prior to AR submittal. For instance, QA is responsible
        for notifying MXG/CC prior to submitting an AR for major maintenance resulting in an
        unserviceable condition of an aircraft.
        14.9.7.2. Squadron and group leadership should be briefed periodically on high interest

  14.9.9. CRM team member composition.
        14.9.9.1. CRM is arranged by teams. Each team is comprised of members from
        specified squadrons and groups. Obtaining team composition is imperative to assignment
        of AR review responsibilities.
        14.9.9.2. Respective RSPs will designate team members requiring OSP and RSP
        permissions to the local ALIS administrators, the ALGS and LST by letter for the
        team/teams under their area of responsibility:
            14.9.9.2.1. This process of gaining OSP and RSP permissions does not alleviate
            completing the permissions section on the ALIS System Permission Request Form.
            14.9.9.2.2. Distribution Team members are responsible for receiving Urgent Field
            Notices (UFN), Time Compliance Technical Data and other correspondence from

                            EXAMPLE AR ROUTING SCENARIOS

Example AR scenario where first level RSP submits AR to ALGS.

Contractor maintenance personnel discovers a broken nutplate that requires drilling. During the
repair process the drill bit fails and creates a scratch in the aircraft panel. JTD is not available to
repair the damaged panel. AR is drafted for repair procedures and submitted by initiator to OSP
for review. OSP reviews the AR, annotates comments, approves AR and forwards to RSP.
RSP reviews the AR, annotates comments, approves the AR and forwards to ALGS. AR Review
Team is not organized because damage is from a known source and does not have fleet wide
implications.

Example AR scenario with fleet implications.

Maintainer discovers a stress crack on panel 100. JTD does not exist to repair damage on the
panel. AR is drafted for repair procedures by and submitted by initiator to OSP for review. OSP
reviews the AR, annotates comments, accepts and forwards the AR to first level RSP.
First level RSP reviews the AR, annotates comments and determines stress crack may have fleet
wide implications. First level RSP informs additional squadrons and starts actions to stand-up
AR Review Team. AR Review Team reviews AR and agrees with potential impact to the fleet.
First level RSP annotates AR upon completion of AR Review Team review (see Attachment 3).
In this scenario, an AR Review Team review is conducted because the damage is caused by an
unknown source and may have fleet wide implications. The first level RSP will ensure all units
are aware of potential fleet problem at Eglin AFB. First level RSP will annotate AR after AR
Review Team review is complete.
