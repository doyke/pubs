Terms
First Year Freshman Option—High school scholarship recipients incur an active duty service
commitment effective the first day of attendance at Aerospace Studies classes or Leadership
Laboratory in their sophomore year. High school scholarship recipients have the right to relinquish
scholarship benefits via the First Year Freshman Option and be disenrolled from Air Force ROTC
without any obligation any time during the freshman year. Such action, however, may jeopardize
the cadet's future entry into any commissioning program.
