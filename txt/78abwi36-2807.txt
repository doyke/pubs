                                          Chapter 1

                                        OVERVIEW

1.1. Purpose. The 78 ABW’s Individual and Team Innovation Awards (I&TIA) Program
recognizes outstanding individual and team innovation to highlight, perpetuate and recognize
exceptional contributions that promote the basic tenets of Air Force Smart Operations for the
21st Century (AFSO21). The I&TIA program specifically recognizes outstanding achievements
that enhance mission capability or a unit’s operational effectiveness or morale by achieving
sustained results that maximize efficiency.
1.2. Responsibilities. The 78 ABW/CVO office will administer and manage the I&TIA
program for the 78 ABW Commander.             Commanders and supervisors at all levels are
responsible for nominating deserving personnel and teams for these awards and for the timely
and accurate completion of all nomination packages.
1.3. Eligibility. These awards recognize individuals and teams that demonstrate outstanding
AFSO21/Innovation results or contributions in their respective work areas. The nominee(s) may
be supporting or representing any functional area or unit and may include civilian, military or
non-appropriated fund employees.        Nominees will be evaluated on their extraordinary
innovation or commitment to the wing’s mission and continuous process improvement
initiatives. Teams may include contract personnel but, contract personnel can only be
recognized within their respective employing organizations (see below).
Note: To ensure compliance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Public Laws
regarding these areas and awards to Contractor employees, Time Off or Monetary Awards may
not be granted to contractor personnel selected for the AFSO21/Innovation award.
1.4. Nomination Process. I&TIA nominations and submissions will be processed when
suspensed via suspense tracking system (STS) through the 78 ABW CAG. CVO will serve as
program OPR for the wing and will manage all nominations and oversee the scoring of award
packages. All nomination submissions will be sent and processed electronically—hard copies
will not be accepted.
1.5. Selection Boards. I&TIA selection boards will be comprised of representatives from each
group. It is strongly recommended that AFSO trained or full time core team members are
selected to serve as award board members. All I&TIA selection boards will be chaired and lead
by 78 ABW/CVO or a representative of that office.        (See Sample Award Scoring Sheets at
Attachments 2 and 3).       After selections have been, CVO will forward the list of proposed
winners to the ABW/CC for final selection and approval.
1.6. Award Presentations. Whenever possible, monthly, quarterly and annual I&TIA winners
will be presented their awards at the 78 ABW’s monthly promotion ceremony by either the Wing
Commander or Vice Commander and the Command Chief.
     1.6.1. Quarterly team award winners will each receive a coin and the overall team will
     receive a certificate and plaque for display in the appropriate work center.
     1.6.2. Annual team award winners will also each receive a team memento and the overall
     team will receive a certificate and plaque for display in the appropriate work center.

   1.6.3. Monthly individual innovation award winners will receive a memento or coin, a
   Certificate of Recognition, and either a one-day pass or an 8-hour time off award as
   appropriate.
   1.6.4. DELETED
   1.6.5. The wing’s annual innovation award winner will receive a plaque and either a two-day
   pass or a 16 hour time off award as appropriate.
1.7. Best Practices. AF Best Practice candidates are unique, successful, proven processes or
techniques processes or techniques should have Command- or AF-wide application. When
warranted, deserving 78 ABW programs or processes recognized by this program should be
submitted for AF Best Practice recognition through the WR-ALC and AFMC. Air Force Best
Practice guidance is contained within AFH 38-210, Air Force Best Practices Clearinghouse, and
is managed by the Air Force Manpower Agency. While HHQ staff assistance and major
inspection teams may discover and/or validate Best Practices, the expectation is that units will
submit Best Practice candidates themselves IAW AFH 38-210.
1.8. Lessons Learned (L2). The AF Lessons Learned Program exists to enhance readiness or
improve combat capability by capitalizing on the experiences of all Airmen. Significant lessons
learned or captured as a result the wing’s continuous process improvement efforts or the I&TIA
program should be considered for submission IAW AFI 90-1601, Air Force Lessons Learned
Program. All Airmen are encouraged to enter observations that contain potential lessons into
the AF’s Joint Lessons Learned Information System (JLLIS) for coordination or inform their
local chain of command as appropriate. Submit potential L2s on AF IMT Forms 4329 or 4330
or via https://www.jllis.mil/USAF.

                                        TEAM AWARDS

2.1. Team Awards. The 78 ABW’s Team Award Program is modeled after the Chief of Staff
Team Excellence Award (CSTEA), as outlined in AFI 36-2868, Chief of Staff Team Excellence
Award. In support of AFI 36-2868, 78 ABW/CVO will ensure the wing’s annual team award
winner is submitted for annual CSTEA recognition through the WR-ALC. For the purpose of
this award, a team is defined as a group of at least 2 but less than 20 personnel.    Team’s
nominated for this award must have been chartered and together as a group for a minimum of 90
days but no more than 540 days (1.5 years).
2.2. Team Selection Criteria. Quarterly and annual team award winners will be recognized
and nominated by CVO to the ABW/CC for final approval. CVO will monitor, evaluate, and
recommend teams based on the team A3, formal event outbriefs, and follow-on 90, 180, and 365
day status updates with the ABW/CC. When forwarding ABW team winners to the ALC or
HHQ for additional recognition, nomination packages must be prepared and will be limited to
NLT one and NMT two pages, single-spaced, bullet format, on an AF Form 1206, Nomination
for Award. Annual team nominations are restricted to two pages on a 1206 only. (See
Attachment 2 for sample AF Form 1206 team award nomination format) One ABW Team
Award will be presented each quarter and once annually. When appropriate, team award
packages will be graded on the following three criteria:
     2.2.1. Process. List the process title and the team description/charter. Describe the mission
     of the organization, how it links to the wing mission and if improvement process was self-
     initiated or directed by senior leadership. Identify your key customers. Include any
     innovative tools ideas and concepts used to develop the final solution. Note the
     comprehensive final solution and the impact to the key customers.
     2.2.2. Impact and Results. List how the process affects the unit mission and to what
     degree. Identify the benefit to the Air Force, MAJCOM, and/or wing. Include costs to
     implement the process improvement, return on investment calculations and validation of the
     elimination of waste, associated resource savings, or cost avoidances.
     2.2.3. Sustainment and Standardization. Identify the steps taken to sustain improvement
     and the steps taken to share improvement(s) throughout MAJCOM and/or the Air Force.
