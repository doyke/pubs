       4.2.4.5. Have the individual hand-carry the AF Form 1314 to their first
       sergeant/orderly room. It will be signed by their commander or designee. The
       designee must be authorized by that unit’s commander in writing and the armory
       must have a copy of the approved designation. Have that individual return the AF
       Form 1314 within 72 hours or their first sergeant will be contacted. When the AF

       and one copy along with the original will go into the individuals designated folder.
       4.2.4.6. Upon completion of all paperwork, the weapons owner will have one copy of

           their commander requesting permanent withdrawal of their POW as well as their
           ID card. Transient personnel are able to sign for their own weapon/s release.
           Prior to release of a transient POW ensure the individual is capable of handling
           firearms. The Armorer must have probable cause/belief the individual is unable
           to bear firearms. Such belief must be based on the individual's observable
           behavior (for example, acting irrationally, physical ability impaired, odor of an
           alcoholic beverage, etc.). If any of these are observed, the individual will be
           informed of the reason for the denial of weapons access. The Armorer will
           immediately notify the individual's flight chief/immediate supervisor and request
           they respond to the Armory. The Armorer will ask the responding supervisor to
           evaluate the individual and determine if the individual will be armed. If the flight
           sergeant/section head gives the Armorer face-to-face authorization, the Armorer
           will arm the individual.
           4.2.5.1.3. The Armorer will verify the individuals ID against the folder on file for
           their POW. Once positive identification is made the Armorer will proceed to
           retrieve the POW.
           4.2.5.1.4. Before returning the POW to the owner ensure that the serial number
           on the weapon as well as any other equipment matches what is receipted for.
           4.2.5.1.5. Once the POW is returned to the owner update all information on the
           storage location.
        4.2.5.2. Temporary Withdrawal.
           4.2.5.2.1. Owners wanting to remove a POW or ammunition from the armory
           temporarily will make an appointment for access and must be made at least 24
           hours in advance.
           4.2.5.2.2. Once the POW owner’s identification is verified pull the owner’s file
           and annotate the withdrawal in the section identified as “record of temporary
           withdrawal” and document the transaction on the POW log located outside of
           storage area.
           4.2.5.2.3. Place the folder in the file box labeled “TEMPORARY
           WITHDRAWAL,” remove the POW from the locker and issue the weapon to the
           individual. Any POW removed from the armory must be returned within 72
           hours unless the unit commander or first sergeant provides written authorization
           for a longer checkout time, ie: leave, TDY, etc. The NCOIC, Armory will check
           the temporary withdrawal folder to ensure time limits are being met.

           4.2.5.2.4. Overdue Weapons. It is the responsibility of the NCOIC, Armory to
           notify the first sergeant or commander of weapon/s that have not been returned

           4.2.5.2.5. POW returns. Document the returned POW on the bottom of the AF

     4.2.6. Privately Owned Ammunition (POA) Storage/Withdrawal.
        4.2.6.1. Whenever an individual places POA into the armory for storage an AF Form
        1297 will be accomplished with the following information: the type, caliber,
        quantity, individual’s full name, grade, squadron, and duty phone number. The
        ammunition will be placed in the same place as the POW when possible. If the POA
        cannot go in the same place as the weapon, place it in the POA overflow container.
        4.2.6.2. When an individual requests removal of POA, the Armorer will issue the
        ammo requested and complete a new AF Form 1297 for any remaining ammo. The
        ammo count will then be updated on the sheet located on the outside of POW storage
        area.
     4.2.7. Denial of POW/POA Withdrawal.
        4.2.7.1. A unit commander may make immediate verbal notification to the armory to
        bar an individual’s access to his/her weapon(s). This notification will be followed by
        a letter within 72 hours. When notified by a commander or first sergeant to bar an
        individual, the On-Duty Armorer will ascertain all information from the person
        making the notification. The AF Form 1314 and AF Form 1297 will be marked in
        red ink with “DO NOT ISSUE.” When an individual is barred, a letter signed by the
        commander is required prior to releasing the weapon back to the owner.
        4.2.7.2. The NCOIC, Armory will be notified on the next duty day whenever a non-
        SF individual is placed on the “DO NOT ISSUE” list.
        4.2.7.3. It is imperative that commanders, first sergeants, and medical personnel who
        have identified individuals as unsafe to bear arms contact BDOC immediately to
        ensure that the individual does not have weapons stored in the arms room.
        4.2.7.4. Under no circumstances will an individual be allowed to remove his/her
        POW or POA from the armory if he/she appears to be under the influence of alcohol,
        drugs, or is not in complete control of his/her mental faculties. If an individual
        requests removal of a weapon under such conditions, the BDOC will immediately
        notify the individual’s commander and first sergeant.
     4.2.8. Abandoned POW & POA.
        4.2.8.1. Personnel who leave GAFB for any purpose other than TDY/deployment
        must take their weapons with them. After one week of additional courtesy storage the
        weapon is considered abandoned. The NCOIC, Armory will send a certified
        memorandum to the owner stating their available options. If a reply is not received
        within a month and all available options have been exhausted the weapon will be
        properly disposed of.
