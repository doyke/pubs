SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document was revised to delete requirement for QA to validate FCF crew members, change
scheduling responsibility from Plans and Scheduling (P&S) to FCF Program Manager and delete
Attachment 1, High Speed Taxi Checklist.
1. Responsibilities: It is the responsibility of the 94th Maintenance Group Commander and the
94th Operations Group Commander to ensure compliance with this instruction.
2. Procedures: When the requirement for a Functional Check Flight (FCF) becomes known,
the responsible section will notify the Quality Assurance Office (MXG/MXQ).
3. Quality Assurance (QA) will:
 2                                                            94AWI21-101 25 OCTOBER 2012


     3.1. Notify the Operations Group FCF Program Manager of the FCF requirement and the
     projected date of aircraft availability for the FCF.
     3.2. Quality Assurance personnel will review the aircraft forms, identifying all items
     requiring FCF and prepare an FCF Checklist, (T.O. 1C-130E(H)-6CL-1 may be used, lining
     out non-applicable items). The checklist cover sheet will identify the tail number, date and
     reason for FCF. The issuance of the checklist will be noted in an FCF control log using the
     same information.
     3.3. A Quality Assurance representative will conduct a briefing for the FCF crew. A
     briefing guide located in the FCF workbook and log will be used to conduct the briefing.
     The updated Weight and Balance “Chart C” will be available to the FCF crew at the briefing.
     After the briefing, the aircraft commander will sign the FCF log to indicate receipt of the
     briefing. In addition to the aircrew, the aircraft crew chief and a representative from the
     section responsible for the FCF condition will attend the preflight FCF briefing to answer any
     questions the aircrew may have.
     3.4. After flight, Quality Assurance will debrief with the appropriate debrief function,
     validate that the FCF crew accomplished all requirements, review the forms to ensure that
     correct entries have been made and notify P&S on the status of the aircraft, (released or not
     released for flight). A copy of the 781A with the closed out FCF write-up and the FCF
     checklist will be given to P&S and the aircraft forms will be released to the crew chief at this
     time.
     3.5. All check-flights will be input and tracked in the QANTTAS database.
4. Operations Group FCF Program Manager will: Schedule the aircraft and qualified
aircrew to fly the FCF mission as soon as possible. The aircraft will be configured the same as
for local training flights. The mission will be flown without cargo or non-essential passengers.
5. Responsible Aircraft Crew Chief will: See that the aircraft is ready for functional check
flight and then deliver the aircraft forms (781’s) and weight and balance book “Chart C” to the
Quality Assurance office for review with the aircrew. The crew chief will also attend the FCF
briefing conducted by Quality Assurance as mentioned in paragraph 3.3 above.
6. Operational Check Flight (OCF): OCF’s will be kept to a minimum and are not used to
replace -6 FCF requirements. OCF’s will be flown by experienced aircrews (not required to be
an FCF qualified aircrew) and will be accomplished following the same maintenance criteria as
FCF’s. Fly OCF’s when an operational check is listed as a -1 or -2 requirement.
7. High Speed Taxi Checks:
     7.1. High speed taxi checks may be utilized instead of FCF’s with MXG/CC and OG/CC
     authorization when a maintenance ground operational check requires aircraft movement at
     higher than normal taxi speeds to operationally check completed maintenance. If this option
     is exercised, process aircraft forms through Quality Assurance using FCF procedures. See
     94th MXG Quality Assurance High Speed Taxi Checklist (Maintained in the 94th MXG QA
     office).

  7.2. Perform high speed taxi checks with qualified FCF aircrew.
