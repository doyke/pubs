     1.4.6.1. Ensure crewmembers complete in-unit mission, ground, and continuation
     training programs. Failure to reasonably progress may require action for removal.
     1.4.6.2. Before each semi-annual training period assign Flying Training Levels (FTL)
     and levels of qualifications (instructor, evaluator, etc.) to assigned (and attached)
     crewmembers (see Chapter 4).
     1.4.6.3. May delegate responsibility to supervisors for completion of formal school post-
     graduate questionnaires via AETC web-based survey system.                            See
     https://www.my.af.mil/agepiftprod/. Complete the questionnaire NLT 120-days after
     student graduation from the FTU at Altus AFB.
     1.4.6.4. Ensure adequate training continuity and supervision of assigned and attached
     crewmember. Unit commanders may assign additional requirements based on individual
     crewmember’s experience and proficiency.
     1.4.6.5. Through the training staff, will review training and evaluation records of a newly
     assigned or attached crewmember and those crewmembers completing formal training, to
     determine the necessary training required to complete/certify the individual as Basic
     Aircraft Qualified (BAQ), Basic Mission Capable (BMC), or Mission Ready (MR) status.
     Make the appropriate training entry on AF Form 4023, Aircrew Training Progress Report
     or MAJCOM approved substitute (see paragraphs A2.1 and A2.3).
     1.4.6.6. Review qualifications and monitor training requirements for unit-assigned Flight
     Surgeons.
     1.4.6.7. Execute unit-level aircrew certifications described in this instruction.
     1.4.6.8. Ensure flight commanders or Sq training flight will monitor/check quality of
     training being accomplished, identify training deficiencies. Advise Sq/CC of additional
     training needs.
  1.4.7. ATS Contractor. The KC-135 Aircrew Training System (ATS) contractor is
  responsible for academic and aircrew training device (ATD) instruction at the R-model
14                                  AFI11-2KC-135V1_452AMWSUP_I 17 FEBRUARY 2010


     formal school at Altus AFB or specialized training at all KC-135 training sites. This
     responsibility includes developing, updating and publishing courseware, formal school
     syllabus, maintain facilities, ATD, etc. according to the KC-135 ATS contract (see Chapter
     6).
     1.4.8. Formal School, Non-ATS. See requirements in AFI 11-202 Volume 1.
     1.4.9. SIMCERT Status. KC-135 OFT simulators receive periodic SIMCERTs to
     gain/maintain Level C+ Certification.         Each simulator has unique conditions and
     maintenance actions that require the device to gain/lose/regain certification. These actions
     have a direct impact on flight events creditable in the ATD (Table 4.4, Table 4.5, Table 4.6,
     and Table 4.7).
        1.4.9.1. Units who require currency updates should check with their host ATD site
        manager for latest status.
        1.4.9.2. ATD Motion Requirements. For crewmembers to log flying training events
        motion systems must be used unless otherwise specified. (see Chapter 4 tables for
        simulator creditable events.) KC-135 OFT simulators modified with motion systems are
        capable of dramatic change in pitch and roll sufficient to cause occupants to be injured (if
        not secured). When training or conducting tours aboard the ATD equipped with motion
        systems, if motion is applied, all parties aboard will have a seat/seatbelt available (and
        fitted), the Instructor Operator Station (IOS) will have a certified operator (see paragraph
        5.7.8). If the amount of people in the ATD exceeds the amount of seats or a certified
        operator is not aboard, do not use motion.
1.5. Waiver Authority.
     1.5.1. Do not deviate from the policies and requirements in this instruction. Report
     deviations or exceptions without waiver through channels to MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent)
     who, in turn, should notify the OPR (lead command) for follow-on action if necessary. Units
     reporting deviations and exceptions will maintain copies of reported deviations/exceptions
     for two years. Waiver requests will include supporting rationale, the training start date, a
     summary of the unit’s training plan, and estimated completion date.
     1.5.2. Unless specified in this instruction, MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent level), is the
     designated waiver authority for specific aircrew training requirements in this instruction that
     are not governed by AFI 11-202, Volume 1, or other AFIs.
     1.5.3. OG/CC is designated waiver authority for minimum flying-hour prerequisites for
     entry into formal upgrade courses (see Table 5.1 or Table 5.4).
     1.5.4. Prerequisites. When a student is entered into a formal course, HQ AETC/A3
     designates 19AF as waiver authority for AETC flying training syllabus and formal school
     prerequisites (exceptions see paragraph 1.5.3 and paragraph 1.5.5). All requests for a
     syllabus waiver must include supporting rationale. User command training staff should
     submit prerequisite waiver requests direct to 19 AF. All waivers must be approved before
     the crewmember departs for formal training. File a copy of all waivers in the trainee’s AF
     Form 4022, Aircrew Training Folder, (electronic copy is authorized, see paragraphs A2.1
     and A2.2) and hand-carry a hard copy to formal school course.
AFI11-2KC-135V1_452AMWSUP_I 17 FEBRUARY 2010                                                15


     1.5.4.1. Formal School Course Prerequisite Waiver. For formal school course
     prerequisite waiver requests, see the appropriate formal course in the ETCA. For Aircraft
     Commander (AC) Upgrade and/or pre-Instructor Course training requirements, send a
     waiver request to MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent), who will endorse and forward to the
     waiver request to 19 AF for final approval.
     1.5.4.2. Formal School Training Waiver. The 19 AF/DO is designated waiver authority
     for completion of specific formal school events at Altus AFB with the concurrence of the
     gaining unit’s OG/CC. MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) is the designated waiver
     authority, in coordination with AMC/A3TK for McConnell AFB training.
     1.5.4.3. If required for squadron’s designated mission, accomplish the events that were
     waived or not accomplished at the formal school, before assigning mission-ready (MR)
     status.
  1.5.5. In-unit Training Waiver. MAJCOM training staff (or equivalent) is approval/waiver
  authority for in-unit training in coordination with HQ AMC/A3TK (for ATS support).
  AMC/A3T, ANG/A3T and AFRC/A3T are designated waiver authorities for the secondary
  method of training at McConnell AFB FTU training center. Before approval, review the
  appropriate syllabus and consider availability of ATS formal instruction and ATD (e.g. OFT
  simulator) requirements. (See paragraph 5.4.5 for previously certified instructors)
  1.5.6. Senior Officer Course (SOC) Waiver. See the appropriate formal course syllabus.
  Refer to AFI 11-202 Volume 1 for SOC policy and eligibility requirements.
  1.5.7. Continuation Training Waiver. The OG/CC (or AFRC/ANG-equivalent) is designated
  waiver authority for semi-annual and currency ground training events as specified in Table
  4.1, Table 4.2, and Table 4.3 and flying continuation training currency and requirements in
  Table 4.4, Table 4.5, Table 4.6, and Table 4.7 for assigned or attached crewmembers (case-
  by-case basis only). The OG/CC waiver authority extends the due date and does not delete
  the requirement. The OG/CC will determine the allowable time period of the waiver (e.g.,
  30-day extension, next training cycle, etc.). This waiver authority will be used judiciously
  and should be based on the individual crewmember’s experience and proficiency level (i.e.,
  waivers will not be based on a crewmember’s availability). OG/CC should consider if
  sufficient flying events were accomplished (to ensure MR proficiency), before waiver
  approval. Do not approve a waiver request for the same flying or ground training event
  deficiency affecting two consecutive training periods. Forward all waiver requests for
  waivers over two consecutive training periods to MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent). For all
  flight currency waiver requests see paragraph 4.9
  1.5.8. Waiver Format. For AMC unit waiver requests, use on-line waiver request service on
  AMC/A3T Community of Practice (CoP) (see paragraph 1.15). AFRC waiver request may
  use AFRC website (see paragraph 1.15.5). Ensure the Volume 1 reference paragraph to be
  waived is included in the waiver request. If necessary, submit a written request through
  OG/CC or equivalent in the format at Figure 1.1. to the appropriate MAJCOM OPR.
  Asterisked (*) items are required for processing. Units will submit waiver requests according
  to Table 1.1. Place a copy of all flying and ground training waivers/training time extensions
  in the individual’s training folder. For waivers not requiring a training folder, OG/CC (or
  designated unit) will retain unit file copies of approved waiver(s) through the appropriate

1.6. Use of Flying Hours.
   1.6.1. Structure unit flying training missions to achieve optimum training. Any by-product
   airlift opportunity resulting from training must not degrade the intended training and will
   comply with applicable Department of Defense Regulation, DoD 4515.13-R, Air
   Transportation Eligibility, AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
       1.6.1.1. It is essential that all personnel at every level prevent the misuse of air mobility
       resources as well as the perception of misuse when planning and executing local or off-
       station training missions.
       1.6.1.2. See AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 3 for off-station training flight requirements.
   1.6.2. Training on Operational Missions. Unless specifically prohibited or restricted by
   weapon system operating procedures or specific theater operations order (OPORD), the
   OG/CC exercising operational control may approve upgrade, qualification or special
   qualification training on operational missions. In order to maximize efficient utilization of
   training resources, 618 Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) and tasked units will jointly
   identify and take maximum advantage of opportunities to conduct appropriate continuation
   training items which may be conveniently suited to concurrent operational mission segments.
   Commanders will ensure the training will not impact mission effectiveness and the
   crewmember receiving training is under the supervision of an instructor of like specialty.
   See passenger-carrying restrictions in AFI 11-401 and AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 3.
18                                  AFI11-2KC-135V1_452AMWSUP_I 17 FEBRUARY 2010


1.7. In-unit Training Time Limitations. Comply with the time limitations in Table 1.2
Crewmembers entered in an in-unit training program for all formal training courses leading to
qualification (or re-qualification) should be dedicated to that training program on a full-time
basis. In-unit training will begin no later than 45-days (90-days for AFRC or ANG) after
reporting or being attached to a new duty station or unit. When conducting in-unit training, the
commander will relieve students of duties not directly related to training.
     1.7.1. Training time start date is the date when the first significant training event (training
     event directly contributing to qualification and upgrade) has begun or 45-days (90-days
     ANG/AFRC) after being attached or assigned to the unit upon completion of the formal
     school course, whichever occurs first (or as specified in MAJCOM supplement). Examples
     of significant training events include: Computer-Based Training (CBT), Part Task Trainer
     (PTT), Operational Flight Trainer (OFT), ground training, flight, etc. MPD pilot upgrade to
     AC time limit begins upon Sq/CC direction to begin completion of the events in paragraph
     5.2.4.1 which lead to AC qualification and certification. Training time ends with the
     successful syllabus completion. One of the following events as indicated by the syllabus:
     flight evaluation (if required as part of the training program), instructor validation of
     successful program completion (―sign-off‖), or Sq/CC certification (if required as part of the
     training program).
     1.7.2. Sq/CC may extend training time up to 60-days (120-days AFRC or ANG) through a
     Memorandum For Record (MFR) documentation in training folder; no notification to
     MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) is required. Extensions exceeding 60-days (120-days AFRC
     or ANG) require MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) approval (AMC AD use AMC/A3T waiver
     website) and will be requested before the crewmember exceeds upgrade training time limits
     in Table 1.2
        1.7.2.1. Use the waiver request format specified in paragraph 1.5.9. Include training
        difficulty, unit corrective action to resolve and prevent recurrence, and estimated
        completion date.

 Notes:
 1. FAIP/OSA (crossflow, etc.) use 120-days.
 2. 180-days for ANG/AFRC.
 3. Upon completion of initial, difference, or requalification training program and obtaining the
 appropriate security clearance. SQ/CCs may delay MCT-OPLAN-8010 for operational reasons
 or lack of security clearance.
 4. Special Operations Air Refueling (SOAR) certification use 120-days.1.8. Training
 Documentation. KC-135 units will use ARMS to document training. Units will use the AF
 Form 4324, Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew Qualification Worksheet, to update aircrew
 certifications. See Chapter 7 for specific ―Q‖ codes. Retain hardcopy until individual’s
 departure. Return the documents to the crewmember upon departure. See Attachment 2 for
 additional information.


1.8. Not Used.
1.9. Flight Evaluator Usage. Use flight evaluators as instructors for any phase of training to
capitalize on their expertise and experience. If an evaluator is the primary instructor to train an
individual, the same evaluator should not administer the associated evaluation.
1.10. Instructor Training and Supervision Requirements.
   1.10.1. All instructors should be MR (wing level and below). Instructors must be current
   and qualified in any event that they instruct. FTU instructors are only required to maintain
   BMC.
   1.10.2. Faculty Training Course (FTC). FTC instructor graduates will conduct flight
   training at the formal school for students performing crewmember duties in the KC-135.
20                                 AFI11-2KC-135V1_452AMWSUP_I 17 FEBRUARY 2010


        1.10.2.1. Maneuvers identified in this AFI or the appropriate syllabus as ―FTU-only‖ or
        ―AETC Instructor Cadre-only‖ will only be accomplished by instructors assigned to the
        formal school at Altus AFB, who have completed FTC and are appropriately certified to
        perform the maneuvers. Exceptions with MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) approval only.
     1.10.3. When performing crewmember duties, the following personnel will be under direct
     supervision of an instructor of like specialty.
        1.10.3.1. All non-current crewmembers. For non-current crewmembers, direct instructor
        supervision is required while performing the non-current event. (See paragraph 4.9.1.1).
        1.10.3.2. All crewmembers in initial, upgrade or requalification flying training unless
        syllabus states that direct supervision is not required.
            1.10.3.2.1. See paragraph 5.2.4. for MPD requirements.
        1.10.3.3. All crewmembers designated by the wing, OG, or Sq/CC.
     1.10.4. All unqualified or Flying Training Level (FTL) E crewmembers require direct
     instructor supervision during all critical-phases-of-flight.
     1.10.5. Only designated ATS contractors or Sq/CC certified USAF instructors may operate
     an OFT. (see paragraph 5.6.7)
        1.10.5.1. Aircrew members regaining currency in an OFT must be under the supervision
        of an USAF instructor or an ATS contract Instructor of like specialty, unless specified.
        1.10.5.2. Aircrew members will not log events for which they are non-current until
        currency is regained.
1.11. Distribution. Units will establish distribution requirements of this AFI.
1.12. Transfer of Aircrews. Before a crewmember will interfly from one unit to another, the
gaining unit will review and assess their qualification and currency. See also AFI 11-401.
     1.12.1. A crewmember qualified in the same Mission-Design Series (MDS) according to
     AFI 11-202 Volume 2, (e.g., KC-135R/T) will be considered qualified throughout the USAF
     KC-135 force with the same MDS-model and mission. Certified/qualified MR crewmember
     transferring between units, accomplish only unit specific training and any applicable events
     in which they have lost currency. See AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 3, Chapter 3, Interfly, for
     additional information.
     1.12.2. For Foreign Military Sales (FMS) training and/or exchange officers, see training
     requirements in AFI 11-401. Initial and/or continuation training requirements are specified
     in the appropriate MOU, OPLAN, agreements and International Program Directives (IPD)
     and should mirror training requirements of this AFI to maximum extent possible.
1.13. Aircrew Training While DNIF. Crewmembers whose status is designated, ―duty not
involving flying (DNIF),‖ may log ground training events, including simulator training, if the

1.14. Aircrew Rated Management Overview.
   1.14.1. Programmed Flying Training (PFT). AETC/A3 designates AETC/A3R to manage
   the KC-135 PFT process in coordination with KC-135 lead and user commands. The PFT
   balances available formal training quotas, ATS throughput, schoolhouse capacities and
   course requirements on a Fiscal Year basis. Annually, units will send projected PFT
   requirements to their respective MAJCOM training staff. When requested, MAJCOM
   training staff will forward projections to AF/A3O for inclusion into the Graduate Program
   Requirements Document (GPRD). AETC/A3R will determine training capacity and report
   shortfall in the GPRD to AF/A3O.
       1.14.1.1. AF/A3O sponsors an annual PFT conference for attendees to consider training
       capacity, MAJCOM training requests, and pipeline aircrew training students from which
       AF/A3O will produce the Graduate Program Guidance Letter (GPGL). AETC/A3R
       publish the annual PFT based on the GPGL.
       1.14.1.2. Throughout the training year, MAJCOM training staff and AETC PFT
       managers use assigned/allocated training quotas to assign individual crewmembers into
       the KC-135 formal schools. Daily student quota adjustments to the annual PFT are made
       on quota management documents. AETC/A3R will publish the quota management
       documents on AETC PFT/Flying Hours/Metrics Programs CoP.
1.15. Information Management. Related mobility aircrew training information, including
Global Ready Aircraft Commander Course (GRACC), KC-135 Aircrew Training System (ATS),
simulator status, is available on a series of commercial and military-only websites. Communities
of Practice (CoPs) are available through the AF Portal: https://www.my.af.mil, ―Communities‖.
The HQ AMC/A3T CoP contains valuable training information.
   1.15.1. HQ AMC/A3TF CoP contains specific information covering the Global Ready
   Aircraft Commander Course (GRACC).
   1.15.2. HQ AMC/A3TK CoP contains specific information, links and other features
   covering the overall KC-135 training programs.
   1.15.3. HQ AMC/A3V CoP contains ASEV inspection guides, FCIF, and other features
   covering the overall KC-135 standardization/evaluation program.
   1.15.4. The ATS Contractor maintains a website containing KC-135 training information,
   photos, courseware listing, GATM information, web-based training courseware and testing,
   etc. Use site address: https://www.kc135ats.net/.
   1.15.5. AFRC/A3T CoP contains specific information, links, waiver, and other features.
   1.15.6. HQ AETC/A3Z website contains the USAF course ETCA at:
   https://etca.randolph.af.mil. KC-135R-model formal school (Altus AFB) syllabi are
   available at AETC site: https://aetc_uft.randolph.af.mil/bookstore/kc-135.htm
   1.15.7. NGB/A3TM CoP contains specific information, links, waiver, and other features.
1.16. Failure to Progress or Complete Training. If a student fails to progress according to
syllabus or training requirements, the command accomplishing the training will conduct a
Progress Review (PR). The PR can recommend continuation in training or actions IAW AFI 11-
402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, e.g. a Flying

Evaluation Board (FEB). The formal school will notify the gaining unit of any AFI 11-402 action
taken.
1.17. Career Enlisted Aviator Skill Levels. CEAs are not tied to AFI 36-2101, Classifying
Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), skill level upgrade. All enlisted aircrew qualifications
are separate and distinct from skill level qualification. Flight evaluations result in an AF Form 8,
Certificate of Aircrew Qualification IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 2. After an AF Form 8 is
completed for the applicable flight evaluation, the crewmember is qualified to perform all duties
assigned to that crew qualification regardless of skill level. Aircrew instructor and flight
examiner qualifications are also separate and distinct from OJT trainer or certifier designation
and are reflected in AFSC by use of ―K‖ prefix (aircrew instructor) and ―Q‖ prefix
(standardization and evaluation flight examiner).
1.18. Aircrew Training Quota Management. The following information describes AMC's
policy and procedures for quota management. This policy was developed from requirements in
AFI 36-2201, 36-2107 and AFI 11-412. This policy is mandatory for all AMC units. All other
units follow MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) guidance.
     1.18.1. AMC Units: Formal Aircrew Training requirements (except for Simulator Refresher
     requirements) will be submitted to the appropriate AMC/A3TF quota manager NLT 30 Sep
     for the following fiscal year. AMC/A3TF will consolidate and crosscheck requests with the
     Pilot Absorption Management System (PAMS) and submit to Air Staff via the annual
     Graduate Program Requirements Document (GPRD) Data Call and finalized at the annual
     Programmed Flying Training (PFT) conference.
        1.18.1.1. Other MAJCOMS: Submit Formal Aircrew Training requirements to
        appropriate MAJCOM Functional Managers NLT 30 SEP for the following fiscal year.
        The Formal Aircrew Training requirements (except for Simulator Refresher
        requirements) will be internally coordinated by MAJCOM Functional managers and
        submitted to Air Staff via the annual Graduate Program Requirements Document
        (GPRD) Data Call and finalized at the annual Programmed Flying Training (PFT)
        conference.
     1.18.2. OSS training offices will submit the rank, full name, SSAN, course, and class
     number to AMC/A3TF NLT 45 days prior to class start date (CSD). Please ensure that any
     internal processes are adjusted to meet this timeline. Training quotas not filled 30 days prior
     to CSD will be offered to the next unit on the AMC/A3TF standby list. OSS training offices
     should reconfirm all scheduled training with their units at least 10 days prior to CSD to
     ensure notification of training, active duty service commitments are established, and orders
     issued.     Please submit all candidates for training quotas using email only to:
     AMC.quotamanagement@scott.af.mil.
        1.18.2.1. All course prerequisites will be completed NLT 30 days prior to CSD to allow
        for remedial training or substitution. Units will internally identify an alternate candidate
        for each allocated quota. If the primary candidate becomes unavailable 30 - 45 days prior
        to CSD, notify AMC/A3TF with the alternate's information. If the primary becomes
        unavailable within 30 days of CSD, contact your host MPF formal training section to
        locally substitute the alternate IAW AMCI 36-2204 - provide a copy of the local
        substitution letter to AMC/A3TF.
AFI11-2KC-135V1_452AMWSUP_I 17 FEBRUARY 2010                                                23


     1.18.2.2. Foreign exchange officers cannot be locally substituted (they must also be
     identified when submitted to load against an allocation), send the replacement's full data
     to AMC/A3TF.
  1.18.3. When submitting local upgrade (secondary method) requests, use the AMC/A3TF
  web-site: https://private.AMC.af.mil/a3/a37t/dot/waivers/userlogin.cfm.
     1.18.3.1. Forward the following information to the appropriate quota manager: rank,
     name, upgrade, course, projected start, projected completion, and a point of contact.
     Inform via e-mail when training is complete. If the training being conducted would
     normally incur an active duty service commitment (ADSC), insure required counseling
     and AF Form 63 is completed prior to start of training. Contact your local MPF Formal
     Training office for additional guidance. MILPDS training RIPs will automatically
     generate ADSC requirements.
  1.18.4. When a training allocation cannot be filled, the OSS training office will notify
  AMC/A3TF so the quota may be reallocated. If circumstances prevent an identified
  candidate from attending the training (e.g., DNIF, unable to complete prerequisite training,
  etc.), inform AMC/A3TF immediately. Return all unused quotas to AMC/A3TF NLT 45
  days prior to CSD.
  1.18.5. All no-shows and late cancellations within 7 days of CSD must be explained.
  Forward an initial report of circumstances to AMC/A3TF quota management office within 24
  hours of CSD. This initial notification will be followed by a memorandum of explanation
  from the OG/CC to AMC/A3T within one week. E-mail is the preferred method. Send to:
  AMC.A3T@scott.af.mil and courtesy copy AMC.quotamanagement@scott.af.mil.
  1.18.6. Global Reach Aircraft Commanders Course (GRACC). Active duty units will be
  given priority over AFRC and ANG units due to mandatory upgrade requirements for AMC
  crews established in AFI 11-MDS Volume 1. Do not submit more than two candidates per
  wing per class without the GRACC scheduler's approval. Submit names NET 45 days and
  NLT 30 days prior to CSD. HQ AMC/A3TF will release the class roster 30 days prior to
  CSD for units to confirm the names and make any necessary corrections. Unfilled quotas will
  be available 14 days prior to CSD and units will be notified. Cancellations must be received
  NLT four duty days prior to CSD to avoid a no-show. HQ AMC/A3TF will not accept any
  additions 72 hours/3 days prior to CSD. Units can still cancel 24 hours prior to CSD to avoid
  a no-show being charged to the unit. No-shows will be handled IAW this paragraph .
  Questions regarding GRACC Scheduling can be referred to HQ AMC/A3TF, DSN 779-
  7881.
  1.18.7. AMC/A3TF will maintain a standby list for each course offered. Send requests for
  additional quotas to AMC/A3TF for placement on the standby list. If unit capability is in
  jeopardy, AMC/A3TF will coordinate with Air Staff and AETC to add or reallocate
  additional quotas. AMC/A3TF quota managers will coordinate with the OSS training offices
  exclusively. Squadrons or individuals will be referred to their OSS training office. This
  policy is to ensure that all offices responsible for quota management are in-synch with each
  other and prevents lost seats. Please submit the name/phone number/e-mail for the primary
  and alternate point of contact for quota management in the OSS.

     1.18.8. AMC units are prohibited from coordinating quota exchanges with other commands.
     OSS/OST training offices will forward all requests to the AMC quota manager for
     coordination with other commands. Please allow for extended coordination time when
     considering this option.
     1.18.9. Senior Officer Training coordination. ALL Senior Officer Training is directed by
     AF/DPO, AF/DPG offices in coordination with MAJCOM Senior Leaders Management
     office and AMC/A3TF, and HQ AETC/A3R. Questions regarding Senior Officer training
     Course, availability and prerequisites can be forwarded to HQ AMC/A3TF @ DSN 779-
     3577. No formal actions to schedule training will be taken until directed by AF/DPO or
     AF/DPG in conjunction with MAJCOM Senior Leaders Management offices.

                          INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General Requirements. AFI 11-202 Volume 1 defines initial qualification training. This
chapter specifies the minimum training requirements for initial qualification, re-qualification,
conversion/difference qualification, and senior officer courses. The primary method for initial
qualification is to attend and complete the appropriate formal training course listed in the ETCA.
When a formal training course (quota) is not available, units may request a waiver to their
MAJCOM to conduct a secondary method of training. Secondary method includes the
completion of the appropriate formal training course--academic only with follow-on flying
training conducted in-unit. As a last resort, request a waiver to complete a formal training course
in-unit using the appropriate syllabus, formal school courseware, and simulator training. In the
waiver request (Figure 1.1) the unit must describe the proposed alternative training solution and
training schedule (see paragraph 1.5.5).
2.2. Initial Qualification Training (IQT) Prerequisites. Complete initial qualification
prerequisites in accordance with AFI 11-202 Volume 1 and the course syllabus. See Chapter 6
for formal IQT course listing and prerequisites in Table 5.1.
2.3. Ground Training Requirements. Complete ground training requirements for initial
qualification in accordance with AFI 11-202 Volume 1 and this instruction. During formal
training, aircrews may complete (and receive credit) for Mobility Training and Ancillary
Training events in Table 4.2 See the appropriate formal training course syllabus.
   2.3.1. If events in Table 2.1 are not accomplished at the FTU, they must be completed at the
   gaining unit. The FTU will provide the gaining unit with documentation indicating
   completion of items in Table 2.1 using standard ARMS Event Identifiers. If in-unit training
   is accomplished in lieu of formal school attendance, unit is responsible for ensuring all
   requirements are completed.
   2.3.2. Completion of initial SERE Schools, combat (SS20) and water (SS32) according to
   AFI 16-1301, Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) Operations, and initial
   aircrew flight equipment training (during formal school) will establish the follow-on due
   dates of training (based on the date first completing the course) for recurring SERE and
   aircrew flight equipment training requirements.

Notes:
1. If not accomplished during formal training.
2. Not required for BAQ crewmembers or SOC graduates not on aircrew mobility status
(includes senior officers and staff officers maintaining BAQ).
3. Mandatory grounding item after expiration date; individual will not fly until required training
is accomplished. Flight Physical expires on the last day of the birth month. Physiological
Training expires 60-months after the last day of the month in which previously accomplished.
4. Initial training is called S-V80-A (CST) or S-V90-A(WST) according to AFI 16-1301 see
paragraph 2.3.2. This training is not accomplished at the FTU, but should be completed before
member arrives at the gaining unit. If the member arrives at the gaining unit without this
training, it should be scheduled as soon as practical.
5. G002 is required 1 per Permanent Change of Station (PCS) per AFI 11-218.
6. LL06 should be accomplished in conjunction with SS02, LL03, or SS05. See Chapter 7.
7. IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1, refer to reference publications which provide guidance for
accomplishment of ancillary training requirements.

2.4. Flying Training Requirements. Complete flying training requirements for initial
qualification in accordance with AFI 11-202 Volume 1 and this instruction.
2.5. Conversion/Differences Qualification Training Requirements. When possible, qualified
instructor aircrew members will provide the training to create an initial cadre. In some instances,
it will be necessary for units to form an initial cadre of crewmember personnel for whom specific
training qualification requirements may be waived upon request. The following conditions will
apply to the management of initial cadre crewmember qualification:
   2.5.1. Tasked MAJCOM, in-coordination with lead and training command, will develop a
   training plan for unit conversions.
       2.5.1.1. The training plan should include provisions to form a nucleus of crewmembers
       to include instructor and flight examiners (initial cadre).
       2.5.1.2. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held,
       e.g. C-17 mission pilot (MP) to KC-135 evaluator pilot (EP), unless previously qualified
       in the conversion aircraft.
   2.5.2. Units with unique aircraft modification (e.g., SATCOM, etc.) or missions (e.g.,
   SOAR, Receiver Air Refueling, etc.) will develop and maintain in-unit difference training
   programs for assigned/attached crewmembers, if not available, as described in paragraph 5.7.
   Units will submit these training programs to the appropriate MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent)
   for approval. Use the appropriate ARMS events in Table 2.2 and include details in local
   supplement.
       2.5.2.1. Q014, Difference Certification. Sq/CC will complete crewmember certification
       when difference training is complete and an evaluation is not required. When applicable,
       annotate ―Q014 Difference Certification‖ (see paragraph 1.8). Away from home station
       the assigned unit will complete an AF Form 4324 and the individual will hand-carry to
       their host unit.
   2.5.3. In-unit Difference Training. Difference training assumes the student is already
   qualified in the XC-135. The KC-135 ATS maintains several difference courses e.g., KC-
28                                 AFI11-2KC-135V1_452AMWSUP_I 17 FEBRUARY 2010


     135 GATM to Pacer CRAG, etc. In addition, CBT difference lessons are pre-loaded on CBT
     systems. When a formal difference course is not available, units will develop a DQT
     program with existing training resources e.g., CBT, etc. and guide in Table 2.2 Include all
     appropriate items in local supplement.
     2.5.3. (452AMW) The 452 OSS/OST will coordinate with the KC-135 ATS for available
     difference courses maintained if in-unit difference training will be conducted. Air Force
     Reserve Command, Training Division (AFRC/A3T) may coordinate a particular base or unit
     which already has an established difference training program. The difference training
     program will be reviewed by the 336 ARS/CC and 336 ARS/DO and approved by the 452
     OG/CC.

See A2.4.7. and A2.4.8. for Grading criteria
Notes:
1. For collocated units, accomplished in ATD only.
2. Pilots in DQT with different power plants will complete AA01 according to AFI 11-2KC-
135 Volume 2.
3. For receiver pilots only (BO, as required).
4. Accomplish if not already qualified/certified.
5. Required for SOAR-certified BO only.
6. If equipped.
7. Traditional CP trained to familiarization level.

2.6. Multiple Qualification. Crewmembers will attend a formal initial qualification course for
dual qualification in different MDS aircraft. Crewmembers maintaining dual qualification in
different model aircraft will, as a minimum, maintain FTL A currency requirements in each
aircraft (N/A for senior officers; see paragraph 2.7).
30                                  AFI11-2KC-135V1_452AMWSUP_I 17 FEBRUARY 2010


     2.6.1. KC-135R and T model aircraft are considered the same MDS and do not meet
     multiple qualification criteria in AFI 11-202 Volume 1.
2.7. Senior Officer Qualification Requirements. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 identifies senior
officer qualification requirements. Senior Officer Course (SOC) graduates will be assigned FTL
E for continuation training purposes and will not fly unsupervised in a primary crew position
(see paragraph 4.3.2.5). KC-135 R-model SOC is available on ETCA.
     2.7.1. After qualification IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and with OG/CC approval, senior
     officers (assigned or attached) may seek training which leads to a higher FTL and/or
     qualification. The unit OSS/OST office is responsible for determining training requirements
     based on the senior officer’s flying experience and familiarity with the weapons system. HQ
     AMC/A3T or appropriate MAJCOM A3T (or equivalent) will approve the proposed training
     plan prior to execution.
     2.7.2. Senior Officers that complete full qualification training requirements will maintain
     FTL A continuation training requirements.
2.8. Flight Surgeons. AFI 11-202 Volume 1 establishes AFI 11-2(MDS) Vol 1 as directive
regarding flight surgeon flying requirements.
     2.8.1. Flight surgeons assigned to unit will complete all items in Table 4.3 for initial
     qualification. Complete flight surgeon testing on AFDL web based training.
2.9. Requalification Training (RQT). Determine RQT using AFI 11-202 Volume 1
Requalification Training requirements for the duration of unqualified time. The ability to
requalify a crewmember should be considered on a case-by-case basis and individual
performance. RQT accomplished at the formal school at Altus AFB will follow the appropriate
ATS course syllabus (see Table 6.1).
     2.9.1. Requalification and instructor training may be conducted simultaneously using the
     matrix at Table 2.3 to determine criteria. For those crewmembers who are unqualified and
     have been removed from KC-135 instructor status for more than 39 months, initiate a waiver
     request to MAJCOM/A3T or equivalent (see Chapter 1) and include a Sq/CC directed
     training plan to regain instructor status when using this option. Units conducting
     simultaneous requalification and instructor training must compare the formal requalification
     course syllabus, instructor course syllabus, matrix at Table 2.3. and the guide at Table 2.4 to
     develop the individuals training plan. The plan must include all phases of training and the
     appropriate (suitable) substitute (e.g. CBT, IBT, simulators, number flights, etc.). For
     simultaneous requalification at the FTU, a waiver is not required; however, requests will be
     made from the gaining unit’s Sq/CC to the 97 TRS prior to the training start date. The FTU
     may decide not to qualify the individual to instructor status based on performance or
     resources.
        2.9.1.1. The FTU may conduct simultaneous requalification and instructor training
        without a waiver for previously qualified KC-135 crewmembers that will be assigned to
        the FTU.
     2.9.2. See AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 2 for simultaneous instructor re-qualification and re-
     qualification evaluation requirements.

 Notes:
 1. Student will complete the most recent web-based pre-attendance instructor course if the
 individual has been unqualified or removed from KC-135 instructor status over 39-months.
 Complete the course, including testing, before the flight evaluation.
 2. For collocated units, accomplish in the ATD only.
 3. Receiver qualified pilots only.
 4. If not already qualified/certified.
 5. Pilots and boom operators require a one-time only certification flight under supervision of a
 like-specialty MPRS instructor.
 6. If equipped.
 7. Assumes Basic Navigator requalification. SOAR-assigned units will develop/maintain a
 SOAR training program (see paragraph 2.10.2.).

2.10. Navigator Training. Navigator training includes three training phases:
     2.10.1. Basic Navigator. KC-135 unit level staff navigator who may perform in-flight duties
     not including rendezvous (RDVZ). These basic navigator duties are limited to system
     operation, communication, and crew coordination. Units may also maintain a local training
     program for initial and requalification training that focus on FMS-3 (B-Kit) operations,
     Checklist procedures, CRM and communication training. The maximum level of
     qualification is BMC (FTL C or FTL E). See ground and continuation training requirements
     in Chapter 4.
        2.10.1.1. Basic navigators may fly any sortie with an FMS-3 suite installed. The BMC
        basic navigator may fly without an instructor of same specialty, once qualified. A BMC
        navigator may deploy and fly as a staff navigator (mission planning cell, scheduler, etc.).
        When used, basic navigator will complete requirements in Table 3.1 and Table 3.2
        BMC basic navigator will comply with Theater Deployment Requirements (e.g.,
        CONOPS, etc.).
        2.10.1.2. Basic navigators non-current (FTL E) may fly with an IN or IP to regain their
        currency (M010) with a FMS-3 Navigator Suite installed.
     2.10.2. SOAR Navigator. KC-135 navigators complement designated SOAR units as
     additional crewmember. SOAR navigator training is conducted in-unit by 22 ARW,
     McConnell AFB. SOAR navigators will be basic-qualified and will maintain MR status for
     the SOAR mission. See ground and continuation training requirements in Chapter 4.
        2.10.2.1. SOAR navigators may fly any sortie with an FMS-3 suite installed.
     2.10.3. Instructor Navigator. See Table 5.4 for minimum flying time requirements. When
     selected for upgrade, complete course prerequisites (see paragraph 5.4.22 and Table 5.4).
     The CBT or web-based lessons (and testing) are a baseline program followed by completion
     of the appropriate in-unit developed instructor training and evaluation. Units will develop
     additional training requirements to meet requirements in paragraph 5.4
AFI11-2KC-135V1_452AMWSUP_I 17 FEBRUARY 2010                                                 35


                                          Chapter 3

           MISSION QUALIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. Description. This chapter establishes minimum criteria and training requirements for
conventional and OPLAN-8010 mission certification training (MCT). All crewmembers will
complete initial/re-qualification training prior to becoming mission ready (MR). Except where
specifically stated, units conducting initial/requalification training and MCT may arrange
mission sequence or sequence training events as necessary to use flying training hours
effectively. Crewmembers will be mission ready (MR) before entry in special mission
certification or upgrade training unless noted in Table 3.1, Table 3.2 or Table 3.3.
Crewmembers in MCT may participate in exercises.
   3.1.1. Conventional certification must be completed prior to crewmembers deploying. If
   operational requirements exist, conventional certification and 8010 certification may be
   conducted separately. If 8010 certification is not conducted in conjunction with conventional
   certification, the crewmember will complete 8010 certification IAW AMCI 10-450, KC-135
   and C-130 OPLAN 8010 Generated and Alert Forces, as soon as conditions permit (return
   from TDY, obtain appropriate clearance, etc.).
3.2. Time Periods for Mission Qualification and Certification Training. See Table 1.2
Completion of ground training requirements in Table 3.1. and flying training requirements in
Table 3.2. will result in a crewmember being declared MR - Conventional. Aircraft commander
conventional certification requires Sq/CC approval through the Review and Certification (R&C)
Board according to AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 2.
   3.2.1. MR – Conventional certified AC Initial Qualification (ACIQ, crossflow PTX1
   graduates) will be counted as a MR pilot for SORTS and TRP purposes and may fly as an
   FPL, on any crew, including operational missions, upon completion of MCT,. ACIQ
   graduates are not considered a MR AC and may not fly as A-code (pilot-in-command) until
   formally certified by the Sq/CC.
   3.2.2. Crewmembers in MCT (who are current and qualified), may fly without an instructor
   of like specialty on CONUS only sorties. OCONUS units may allow NMR crewmembers to
   fly local, routine, and non-contingency overseas sorties in their respective theater. NMR AC
   may perform AC duties under supervision of an IP.
   3.2.3. For units with OPLAN-8010, completion of the appropriate training events in Table
   3.3 will result in a crewmember being declared MR – OPLAN-8010. Certification will
   include a mission briefing to the Wg/CC or designated representative.
       3.2.3.1. Units will attempt to have 100 percent of line crewmembers OPLAN-8010
       certified (not required for basic or SOAR navigators). Complete events in Table 3.3
       before Q010, OPLAN-8010 certification.
       3.2.3.2. OPLAN-8010 certification is not required for crewmembers attached for the
       purposes of maintaining flying currency and expertise (i.e. MAJCOM HQ and NAF
       assigned crewmembers).
       3.2.3.3. Q010 is not required for formal school instructors unless specified in MAJCOM
       supplement.

3.3. Ground Training Requirements. All crewmembers will complete applicable events in
Table 3.1, as well as any events not accomplished at the FTU in Table 2.1. For units with
OPLAN-8010, complete all applicable ground events in Table 3.3. MCT is not applicable for
senior officers or staff officers who maintain BAQ (except basic navigator) and may be
accomplished concurrently with other training programs or courses.
     3.3.1. Local training and CONUS missions may be flown before completing all events
     except as noted in Table 3.1.
     3.3.2. If required, complete FTU proficiency (P) events (not accomplished at formal school
     course) before MR.
     3.3.3. MR crewmembers transferring between units will require only Aircraft Ground
     Marshaling Training and Examination (G002), ISOPREP Review (G120), Local Area
     Survival (SS01), Aircrew Flight Equipment Familiarization (LL01), and unit-specific MR
     training events (and events in which they may have lost currency during the change-of-
     station).
     3.3.4. Ground training events accomplished during MCT establishes the crewmember’s due
     dates for subsequent continuation training. Completion of S-V80-A, S-V90-A according to
     AFI 16-1301, and initial aircrew flight equipment training (during formal school) will
     establish the follow-on due dates of training (based on the date first completing the course)
     for recurring SS02, SS03, SS05, SS06, an G100 requirements.

                                           Chapter 4

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. Description. This chapter establishes the minimum flying and related ground training
requirements to maintain currency. The unit commander will ensure each crewmember receives
sufficient continuation training to maintain individual proficiency.
4.2. Aircrew Status. KC-135 crewmembers are assigned to the following status:
   4.2.1. Mission Ready (MR). For Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS),
   operational tasking, and deployments a MR crewmember is defined as one who is available
   and qualified in the squadron’s mission (will have completed qualification and mission
   certification training for the applicable crew position in this AFI).
   4.2.2. Non-Mission Ready (NMR). A crewmember that is unqualified, non-current or
   incomplete in required continuation training, or not certified to perform the unit mission. See
   paragraph 4.9 for specific guidance on crewmembers who are non-current or incomplete in
   continuation training.
   4.2.3. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). A non-mission ready (NMR) crewmember assigned
   to MAJCOM headquarters, NAF, 618 TACC, USAF Expeditionary Center, Contingency
   Response Wing (CRW), Contingency Response Group (CRG), formal school, or Direct
   Reporting Unit (DRU), who has satisfactorily completed mission certification training, does
   not maintain MR status, but maintains familiarization in the command’s or unit’s operational
   mission. Basic (non-SOAR) navigators should be assigned BMC.
       4.2.3.1. The crewmember may maintain qualification in some aspects of the unit mission
       and is able to attain full qualification in the unit mission within 45 days.
       4.2.3.2. Formal School (AETC) BMC crewmembers are qualified to conduct all aspects
       of the AETC training mission. AETC instructors must be qualified in the training/unit
       mission before performing instructor duties. Current and qualified formal school
       instructors maintain MR status if they complete the appropriate events in Chapter 4
       (events exempted by note).
       4.2.3.3. BMC crewmembers may log instructor or evaluator time for the portion of the
       mission for which they are current and qualified and performing instructor or evaluator
       duties.
   4.2.4. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ). A crewmember that has satisfactorily completed
   initial qualification training and is qualified to perform aircrew duties in the unit aircraft.
   4.2.5. MR, BMC, and BAQ crewmembers must accomplish and/or maintain the
   requirements                                                                            in
   AFI 11-202 Volume 1 (for their respective status) and the appropriate events in the ground
   and semi-annual flying continuation tables in Chapter 4.

4.3. Training Levels.
     4.3.1. Sq/CC will assign Flying Training Levels (FTL) to assigned (and attached)
     crewmembers (see paragraph 1.4.6.2). Base FTL assignments on experience and aircraft
     proficiency.
        4.3.1.1. NMR crewmembers assigned to MAJCOM staff, NAF, 618 TACC, USAF
        Expeditionary Center, CRW, CRG, formal school, or direct reporting unit (DRU), are
        normally categorized as BMC and assigned FTL A or FTL E. Basic (non-SOAR)
        navigators are assigned FTL C or E.
        4.3.1.2. MAJCOM staff and/or NAF instructor/flight evaluators may fly unsupervised
        when maintaining FTL A and applicable ground training in Table 4.1. BMC MAJCOM
        instructors or evaluators assigned overseas or in the CONUS may fly unsupervised on
        routine, non-contingency sorties in their respective theaters. Lead Command evaluators
        may fly unsupervised in any theater when maintaining FTL A and applicable training in
        Table 4.1 and 4.2.
        4.3.1.3. Formal school instructors are exempt from a series of training events (e.g.,
        G182, G190, LL04, P280, Q016, SS02, and SS03) unless specified in MAJCOM
        supplement.
     4.3.2. Flying Training Levels (FTL).
        4.3.2.1. FTL A Highly Experienced Crewmembers. (As a guide, crewmembers having
        10 or more years of operational flying experience) This may include MR or NMR
        MAJCOM headquarters staff and 618 TACC personnel; formal schoolhouse instructors;
        NAF personnel; USAFEC instructors, WG/CC, OG/CC, and Sq/CC, operations officers,
        crewmembers assigned to OG evaluation positions, and instructors assigned primarily to
        staff duties. Sq/CC may assign highly experienced MR line crewmembers to FTL A.
        4.3.2.2. FTL B Experienced, MR Crewmember. (As a guide, crewmembers having
        between 5-10 years of operational flying experience)
        4.3.2.3. FTL C MR Crewmember or BAQ Crewmember pursuing MR status after initial
        qualification training. (As a guide, crewmembers having less than 5 years of operational
        flying experience) Initially assign inexperienced MR crewmembers to FTL C.
        4.3.2.4. FTL D No longer used.
        4.3.2.5. FTL E — BAQ or BMC non-instructor staff. May include senior officers,
        MAJCOM, NAF, and 618 TACC staff who are not maintaining MR or instructor status.
        FTL E requirements are insufficient for MR status, and crewmembers assigned to FTL E
        will fly with an instructor of like specialty at all times. (see paragraph 1.10.4) BMC
        Basic Navigators see paragraph 2.10.1
        4.3.2.6. Change of FTL. Once the semi-annual period begins, do not move a
        crewmember to a level requiring fewer events. (Exception: Units associating FTLs with
        crew positions may change FTLs after upgrade i.e. instructor upgrade) BAQ
        crewmembers may be placed into a different FTL any time after attaining MR status.
        Prorate events upon changing training levels.
AFI11-2KC-135V1_452AMWSUP_I 17 FEBRUARY 2010                                                   43


   4.3.3. Ground Training Levels (GTL). Operational flying includes all MAF aircraft flight
   training where the aviator receives periodic continuation training. Separate levels are no
   longer utilized. All crewmembers will follow the frequency listed for their crew position in
   Table 4.1 See notes for when exceptions apply.
4.4. Training Events/Tables. ARMS training event identifiers and event descriptions are listed
in Chapter 7. The unit may designate Unit Defined Events (UDE) as ―X‖ event (i.e. X020) and
will include local X event identifiers and description in local supplement.
   4.4.1. Crediting Event Accomplishment. Credit required events accomplished on training
   missions, operational missions and satisfactory qualification evaluations toward the
   crewmembers currency requirements. Event completion establishes a subsequent due date.
   Use date of evaluation as the date of accomplishment for all flying training currency events
   that were trained during the formal course. Pilots may credit G271, G272, G273, and G274
   upon satisfactory completion of evaluation for the formal course (use the evaluation date as
   the date of accomplishment). ATS courses are listed in Table 6.1. (see paragraph 4.8 for
   proration).
       4.4.1.1. Credit all AC Upgrade and instructor course training event accomplishments
       toward continuation training requirements for the crew position in which the individual is
       currently qualified, including upgrade training done in the left seat and pre- (or post)
       instructor course pilot training done in the right seat.
   4.4.2. For an unsatisfactory flight evaluation, do not log continuation training events items
   graded Q-3 (according to AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 2) until re-qualified.
   4.4.3. Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period.
   4.4.4. Instructor training requirements and responsibilities. Instructors and flight examiners
   may credit 50 percent of their total continuation training requirements per event while
   instructing or evaluating. Exception: Instructor and flight examiner pilots may not credit
   takeoff or landings flown by another pilot. Instructor and flight examiner boom operators
   may not credit R070, R073, R100, R120, R125, R130, R140, R150, R155, R160, R165
   accomplished by another boom operator.
   4.4.5. ARMS. Record all training events in ARMS (with the appropriate exemptions, notes,
   and adjustment in the course descriptions).
       4.4.5.1. Training events conducted during block training or phase training may be
       consolidated under one ARMS entry.
       4.4.5.2. Use one ARMS entry for combined training events.
       4.4.5.3. Input all one-time events and events required for Permanent Change-of-Station
       (PCS) in the ARMS database. Do not maintain these events on the crewmember’s
       currency report unless specified in local supplement.
       4.4.5.4. Flying events accomplished in the simulator as allowed in Table 4.4, Table 4.5,
       Table 4.6., and Table 4.7 will be coded with an ―S‖ prefix and within ARMS use the
       Restrictions tab under Profile Task Information. Ensure the maximum number of
       simulator creditable events is not exceeded.

4.5. Continuation Training Requirements.
     4.5.1. Completion and tracking of continuation training is the responsibility of the individual
     crewmember. Crewmembers shall actively work with unit schedulers and training offices to
     ensure their continuation training is accomplished as described in this chapter.
     4.5.2. Ground Training Events. Crewmembers will comply with requirements of Table 4.1,
     Table 4.2 and Table 4.3
        4.5.2.1. Failure to accomplish events in Table 4.1 leads to non-mission ready status. See
        paragraph 4.9 for exceptions and for regaining mission ready status.
        4.5.2.2. Failure to complete mobility training in Table 4.2 does not lead to non-mission
        ready status, but may restrict member from certain missions. Mobility training items for
        attached personnel (i.e. MAJCOM, NAF, USAFEC, etc.) are not required to be tracked at
        unit of attachment unless deploying with attached unit. These individuals mobility
        requirements will be determined and tracked by assigned unit’s UDM.
        4.5.2.3. Crewmembers attached to units (i.e., NAF, MAJCOM, USAFEC, etc.) may
        accomplish ground training events at locations other than their unit of attachment. The
        crewmember is responsible for reporting accomplished training events to their unit of
        attachment (ARMS office).
        4.5.2.4. Crewmembers performing alert duty may accomplish ground training that does
        not degrade required response time or mission accomplishment. Specify requirements
        and or restriction in MAJCOM supplement and local supplement.
        4.5.2.4. (452AMW) Crewmembers who are on alert duty may perform ground training
        without restriction, provided required response time will not be degraded.
        4.5.2.5. Flight Surgeons use requirements in Table 4.3

Table 4.1. Aircrew Ground Continuation Tng Reqs (Failure to accomplish = NMR).

Notes:
1. Failure to accomplish recurring ground events will result in ―do not fly‖ status until the
training is accomplished.
2. Flight Surgeons without a mobility requirement (not on mobility status) do not need to
accomplish this training. Should be tracked in ARMS (accomplish when due).
3. See Unit Deployment Manager (UDM) for Mobility Folder Review frequency and additional
USAF Ancillary and Mobility requirements.
4. X denotes designator to differentiate different contingency and/or theater training tasking
requirements. Units may use suffix ―E‖ for Enduring Freedom, ―I‖ for Iraqi Freedom, and ―H‖
for Horn of Africa.
5. The OG/CC or equivalent is the waiver authority for this event. See paragraph 4.9.3
6. Flight Physical and Physiological Training are tracked on the top of each crewmember’s
Individual Training Summary (ITS). Therefore there is no longer a need to assign and track
these training events in the training module of ARMS.




     4.5.3. Flying Continuation Training Requirements. Use Table 4.4, Table 4.5, and Table
     4.6 See Chapter 7 for event descriptions.
AFI11-2KC-135V1_452AMWSUP_I 17 FEBRUARY 2010                                                               49


        4.5.3.1. ATD Credit for Training Requirements. Crewmembers may credit flight
        training events in Table 4.4, Table 4.5, Table 4.6, and Table 4.7 in the ATD as noted
        (see paragraph 4.4.5.4 for ARMS tracking). Both continuation training events and other
        events are listed.
           4.5.3.1.1. Continuation training OFT profiles (G271-G274, or G278) should be
           scheduled once per quarter to allow crewmembers the opportunity to train on
           emergency procedures throughout the year.
           4.5.3.1.2. ATS contract instructor’s supervision meets the requirements for
           continuation training events requiring instructor or direct instructor supervision.
        4.5.3.2. As a minimum, senior officer and all other crewmembers maintaining BMC or
        BAQ status in the KC-135 will maintain FTL E. Senior officers on MR status will
        comply with Table 4.4, Table 4.5 This requirement also applies to additional aircraft in
        which a senior officer may be qualified (see multiple qualification). See AFI 11-401 and
        AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 3 for passenger carrying restrictions.
        4.5.3.3. Each MAJCOM provides flying-hours to each wing as training, test, and ferry
        hours or organizational and maintenance (O & M) hours. Allocated flying hours are
        based on FTL C, and are designed to provide all crew positions with sufficient hours to
        accomplish all continuation flying training requirements with percentage of completion
        aboard flight simulators.

Notes:
1. Not required for BMC aircrew unless specified in MAJCOM Supplement.
2. Not required for formal school instructors unless specified in MAJCOM supplement.
3. SOAR-certified pilots only.
4. Receiver qualified pilots only. Loss of currency (R010, R013) or failure to complete semi-
annual volume requirement (R010, R013, R020, R035, R040, and R050) does not result in a loss
of mission ready status. Crewmembers may continue to participate unsupervised in all missions
not requiring receiver AAR; they may not deploy as a receiver-SOAR crewmember (i.e., filling
a receiver-SOAR requirement) until the event is accomplished or currency is regained.
5. OG/CC may substitute CONUS operational sorties for overseas sorties when tanker/airlift
requirements or crewmember availability is insufficient for accomplishing the overseas sortie
requirement. Consecutive CONUS sortie substitutions are not permitted.
6. Loss of currency does not result in a loss of mission ready status.

attempt to accomplish as many three-engine training requirements as possible in the simulator.
Unless specified by MAJCOM/A3.
9. Multiple aircraft qualified pilots, will accomplish one event quarterly in each aircraft model
qualified (qualified/maintaining currency in two MDS model aircraft, e.g., KC-135R and RC-
135W). KC-135 R and T model aircraft are considered the same MDS (see paragraph 1.12.1.).
10. OG/CC may authorize 90-Day currency extension for night events to compensate for
climatic adjustments (long-daylight periods in summer). OG/CC may authorize pro-ration of
night events for the period 1 April through 30 September.

13. Items with asterisk (*) are for required for MPD pilots only.
14. Complete the event in the aircraft if simulator is not available.
15. Currency requirement for touch and go certified AC only. Loss of currency does not result
in loss of Mission Ready (MR) status.
16. N/A for units permanently based overseas.
17. Units with more than one aircraft configuration (e.g., Block 40 and Block 30) and
crewmember is maintaining qualification/certification in Block 30. If currency is lost, must
regain B30 currency with an IP; if currency is lost for 6 months or more (18 months since last
flown B30), must accomplish the A035 syllabus, see 7.2.14. If not collocated with an ATD,
may substitute aircraft flight for A035F.
18. ATD link to second ATD required for credit if not accomplished in aircraft. Do not dual log
F030 with an F020 if F030 is accomplished in the ATD (since linked ATD is not needed for
F030).
19. Accomplish CPDLC and/or ADS operations. May accomplish M007 in the ATD using
G27x simulator profile with Data Link objectives.
20. Pilots may log event complete if accomplishing PF or PNF duties.

22. Required upon completion of certification/qualification (Block 40, RNAV/GPS).
23. ANG, AFRC and AETC R-model pilots complete four formal ATS instructed OFT system
simulators (G271-G274) per year. Complete Data Link profile if GATM System (Q040)
certified. With MAJCOM waiver/approval in coordination with AMC/A3T, units may elect to
complete a minimum of two (of the four OFT system profiles) per year. If used, alternate
accomplishing the OFT profiles biennially.
24. CRM MOST (G240) are combined with ATS R-model simulator profiles (G271-G274).
Complete one profile and dual log credit for G230. When co-located at ATS facility, Boom
Operators and SOAR Navigators will attend a minimum of one ATD profile (MOST). Boom
Operators, whose pilots are attending a non co-located ATD at an off-site ATS facility are
encouraged to attend a minimum of one ATD simulator profile for G240, CRM MOST.
25. All pilots (i.e. EP, IP, MP, FPx) will log left and right seat takeoffs and landings to ensure
balanced exposure of the entire pilot crew force.
26. Not required for pilots assigned to MAJCOM HQ, NAF, 618 TACC, USAF EC.

Notes:
1. Motion not required to credit using simulator.

4.6. Flight Surgeon Continuation Flying Requirements. Flight Surgeons will comply with
the requirements of this volume and AFI 11-202, Volume 1. See Table 4.3 for flight surgeon
ground continuation training requirements.
   4.6.1. Flight Surgeon loss of flying currency. Units will notify the MAJCOM Command
   Surgeon of non-current Flight Surgeons (AMC units send notification to HQ AMC/SGP).
       4.6.1.1. Flight Surgeons that exceed 60 days between sorties (but less than 180 days)
       require completion of emergency egress training (non-ejection) with a certified aircrew
       instructor prior to the next flight.
       4.6.1.2. Flight Surgeons that exceed 180 days between sorties require completion of
       emergency egress training (non-ejection) with a certified aircrew instructor prior to the
       next flight, completion of the online Flight Surgeon Qualification Exam
       (https://afms.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp), and compliance with local qualification
       guidance.

4.7. Ancillary Training.
     4.7.1. Definition. Ancillary Training is guidance or instruction that contributes to mission
     accomplishment, but is separate from an Air Force Specialty or occupational series. AFI 11-
     2KC-135 Volume 1 is not the governing directive for completion of ancillary training events.
     IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1 the source AFI provides training frequency for these events
     unless an approved waiver has been authorized. See Unit Deployment Manger representative
     to ensure compliance with additional USAF personnel training requirements.
4.8. Proration of Training. AFI 11-202 Volume 1 describes proration of training requirements
for crewmembers not available for flying duties. In addition, prorate training for non-availability
due to contingency alerts and contingency flying TDYs when contingency precludes training for
certain mission events (PACAF and USAFE: also contingency operations from home station).
This authority must be used judiciously, especially when prorating the same crewmember for
consecutive semi-annual training periods.
     4.8.1. Use this formula to determine training requirements at the end of the training cycle:
     number of months available times the event volume divided by the number of months in the
     training period. Round down to the nearest whole number, but not less than 1 (e.g. 5.6
     rounds to 5).
        4.8.1.1. Use Table 4.8 to determine the number of months available. Prorate only if
        absence is at least 15-cumulative days.
        4.8.1.2. When an individual permanently changes station (PCS) during the training cycle
        to a unit flying the same model aircraft and enters the same FTL or lower, credit training
        accomplished at the previous base. Prorate training requirements based on the time
        available (e.g., time at former base, plus time at new base, minus number of days not
        available) during the training period. Time available starts 7 days after sign-in for
        CONUS, 14 days after sign-in for OCONUS or on the date of actual accomplishment of
        the first training event, whichever occurs first. Subtract previous accomplishments from
        the prorated total to determine remaining requirements.
     4.8.2. Units may also prorate requirements for individuals changing training levels. Prorate
     remaining training requirements for copilots entered into Category I AC upgrade training
     from beginning of the training cycle to the date entered into upgrade training (paragraph
     5.3.2). Units will consider AC Qualification students in a non-flying Temporary Duty (TDY)
     status during the academic and flying portions of training.

4.9. Failure to Complete Training Requirements. Declare individuals NMR if they fail to
maintain flying currency, fail to complete semi-annual flying continuation training requirements
or ground continuation training requirements. The following guidance applies:
   4.9.1. Flight Training Currency. Flight currency is associated with those events denoted in
   the flying continuation training tables by a specific period of time (monthly, quarterly, semi-
   annual, or annually) within which an event must be accomplished. A currency event must be
   accomplished at least once within that specified time in order to maintain the currency.
       4.9.1.1. Loss of Currency. Place individuals in one or more currency events in
       supervised training status for that event and declare them NMR in those unit missions
       requiring that event. Crewmembers are ―non-current‖ the day after event currency
       expires (i.e. a crewmember, who accomplished a monthly currency event on 5 September,
       becomes non-current on 1 November).
           4.9.1.1.1. A Pilot non-current in Takeoff (P010, P020, P040), Landings (P170, P180,
           P190), Approaches (P070), or Landing, Night (unaided) (P192) will not fly
           unsupervised on any sortie.
           4.9.1.1.2. Pilots non-current in Data Link (M007) still maintain MR status and may
           fly the Block 40.X aircraft in a non-Data Link mode, and may still deploy OCONUS
           in either Block 40.X or Block 30 (Pacer CRAG) (if applicable) aircraft.
           4.9.1.1.3. Pilots non-current in N010 Tanker RV do not require direct instructor pilot
           supervision.
           4.9.1.1.4. A navigator who is non-current may be supervised by an instructor pilot
           and may regain currency by the same. (Except SOAR RV)
           4.9.1.1.5. For all other non-current events, place individuals in supervised training
           status for that event and declare them NMR in unit missions requiring the event. The
           crewmember cannot deploy until currency is regained. (see paragraph 1.10.3.1)
           EXAMPLE: If the individual is non-current for tanker air refueling, the individual
           may fly unsupervised on CONUS sorties which are not scheduled for and do not
           accomplish tanker air refueling. OCONUS MAJCOM may allow individuals to fly
           local, routine, and non-contingency mission in their respective theater as specified in
           local or MAJCOM supplement.
       4.9.1.2. Regaining Currency.
           4.9.1.2.1. Loss of Currency up to 6-Months. Crewmembers maintain their current
           training level and no training folder is required. Crewmember must demonstrate
           proficiency in the aircraft or simulator (as appropriate) in all delinquent items while
           under supervision of an instructor. (see paragraph 1.10.3.1 and 1.10.5.1).
              4.9.1.2.1.1. If a pilot or navigator has not accomplished data link procedures for
              up to 6 months, the crewmember will accomplish refresher data link CBTs (if
              available), review aircraft normal/ abnormal data link operations/procedures, and
              review appropriate data link operating manuals prior to (within 30 days) planned
              flights in areas where data link operations with air traffic services unit(s) (ATSU)
              are anticipated.

            4.9.1.2.2. Loss of Currency exceeding 6-Months.           Crewmember is declared
            Unqualified for a loss of currency of events in Table 4.4, Table 4.5, and Table 4.6.
            The crewmember will complete Sq/ CC directed requalification training (and
            evaluation, if required) according to AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 2.
                4.9.1.2.2.1. If a pilot has lost currency in Block 30 sortie (M008), and the loss of
                currency has exceeded 6 Months, the pilot is uncertified in Block 30 and will only
                maintain their Block 40 qualification. A035 is required to regain Block 30
                certification, see 7.2.14.
     4.9.2. Failure to Complete Semi-annual Flying Training Events.
        4.9.2.1. The Sq/CC will review ARMS products at the end of each semi-annual training
        period. For individuals who fail to accomplish training requirements, the Sq/CC will
        either declare them NMR or request an OG/CC Waiver for the requirement (paragraph
        1.5.7.).
        4.9.2.2. Waivers for Flight Training Events. The Sq/CC will send waiver requests for
        Failure-to-complete and Loss-of-Currency to the OG/CC for endorsement, per paragraph
        1.5.7.
     4.9.3. Ground Training Events.
        4.9.3.1. Failure to Complete. Individuals who fail to complete ground training
        requirements are declared NMR. The crewmember cannot deploy until training is
        accomplished (EXCEPTION: Noncurrent crewmembers may fly unsupervised on local,
        routine, and CONUS missions according to Table 4.1 on sorties not requiring the ground
        training event).
            4.9.3.1.1. If a crewmember is incomplete in 8010 ground training, the OG/CC may
            waive the event(s) for only one quarter. If the crewmember is incomplete for
            subsequent quarters the OG/CCs may elect to allow crewmembers to remain MR –
            conventional only. Make-up training should be complete as soon as practicable in the
            delinquent 8010 items.
            4.9.3.1.2. An individual NMR for failure to complete Hazardous Cargo Training
            (G182) may fly unsupervised on local training missions only with Sq/CC approval
            until training is completed.
        4.9.3.2. Waivers for Ground Training Events. The OG/CC or equivalent may waive
        ground continuation training events identified in Table 4.1, Table 4.2, and Table 4.3 per
        1.5.7 The decision to grant a waiver will be based on the individual crewmember’s
        experience and proficiency level (i.e. waivers will not be based on a crewmember’s
        availability). OG/CC will determine the allowable time period of the waiver. The make-
        up training should be accomplished at the earliest opportunity. This waiver is for
        unforeseen circumstances only and only for events that will not degrade mission
        accomplishment.
     4.9.4. Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period.
4.10. Requirements Before PCS Or TDY By Members On Active Flying Status. AFI 11-
202 Volume 1 specifies requirements before PCS or TDY.
AFI11-2KC-135V1_452AMWSUP_I 17 FEBRUARY 2010                                              61


4.11. Requirements Before Removal From Active Flying Status. AFI 11-202 Volume 1
specifies requirements before removal from active flying.
4.12. Requirements While In Inactive Flying Status. AFI 11-202 Volume 1 specifies
requirements while in inactive flying status.
4.13. Retraining. AFI 11-202 Volume 1 specifies retraining restriction before separation,
retirement, or mandatory inactive flying status.
4.14. Aircrews Flying in Non-US Air Force Aircraft and with Non-US Air Force
Units. AFI 11-202 Volume 1 addresses individuals flying in this status.
4.15. Training Period. The tables are based on semi-annual flying continuation training event
requirements with the first cycle beginning on 1 January and ending on 30 June and second
cycle beginning 1 July and ending on 31 December.

 Notes:
 1. TFT represents all flying time logged aboard a fixed wing aircraft as a ―military‖ pilot
 including UPT, student, and ―other‖ time (but does not include time in another aircrew
 specialty). Simulator time is creditable to meet TFT requirement.
 2. KC-135 simulator time counts towards PAA. Aircraft flying hours count towards PAA hours
 required before R&C Board certification. Do not count other time towards PAA time.
 3. GRACC, if required (see paragraph 5.4).
 4. 100 hours required in KC-135 PAA before R&C to perform aircraft commander duties.
 5. For Pilot cross-flow from MWS with similar skillset (i.e.C-17, C-5) use TX2. Those with
 dissimilar background (i.e.T-1, F-16) use TX1
 *PAA in this Table refers to hours accumulated in the KC-135 aircraft (primary, secondary,
 instructor or evaluator).

5.2. Mobility Pilot Development (MPD). The Mobility Pilot Development aircraft commander
upgrade program is a continuous upgrade process to replace legacy copilot aircraft commander
upgrade courses. This section applies to SUPT graduates upon successful completion of FTU
Pilot Initial Qualification (PIQ) and MCT. The MPD program includes PIQ, continuation
training (simulator training, local sorties and a variety of mission types: business efforts,
CORONET’s, deployments, etc.) and the upgrade process. MPD upgrade process is a three step
process (identification, training, and certification). See minimum flying hour requirements in
Table 5.1. All MPD pilots will be dual-seat qualified pilots and will maintain qualification
requirements according to AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 2. MPD pilots are not Aircraft
Commanders, but should be considered in continuous aircraft commander training upon
graduation from the FTU until AC certification. They will gradually make the transition from
inexperienced PIQ graduate to Aircraft Commander. Training timelines are based on
performance and, at the discretion of the Sq/CC, tailored to an individual’s capabilities and
experience level.
   5.2.1. Continuation Training. Upon initial enrollment in MCT, the intention is to allow the
   MPD pilot to concentrate on learning flying and non-flying duties in both seats as well as
   familiarization with KC-135 employment.
       5.2.2.1. The MPD pilot may fly unrestricted with an IP or MP in either seat, based upon
       the aircraft commander’s judgment and Operational Risk Management (ORM)
       decision. Sq/CCs must ensure that MPD pilots receive balanced exposure to the left and
       right seats to ensure proficiency and currency with the flying and non-flying duties in
       both seat positions and gain experience prior to Aircraft Commander upgrade.
          5.2.2.1.1. MPD Pilots will maintain proficiency in emergency procedures as listed in
          Table 4.4 MPD Pilot will be under direct IP supervision if accomplishing emergency
          procedures in the aircraft.
          5.2.2.1.2. MPD pilots will track left and right seat takeoffs and landings in ARMS, as
          listed in Table 4.4 Accomplish simulator profiles from either seat to meet training
          requirements.
       5.2.2.2. MPD Documentation. An MPD pilot training folder will be opened upon MPD
       pilot arrival at the unit and will remain open until the MPD pilot has completed MCT. A
       second training folder will be opened upon SQ/CC selection for upgrade until certified as
       an aircraft commander (electronic versions are authorized and encouraged). Training
       programs may be combined in a single training folder at the unit’s discretion.
          5.2.2.2.1. Use the AF Form 4025 to close the MPD MCT folder upon MR status and

5.3. Aircraft Commander (AC) (Traditional Copilots Only). Remaining traditional copilots
will continue to upgrade to aircraft commander by attending the PIQ course at Altus AFB
followed by an accelerated MPD pilot upgrade timeline upon return to home unit as determined
by the SQ/CC.
     5.3.1. General. Flying time prerequisites required for upgrade are based on a pilot having
     gained knowledge and judgment required to effectively accomplish the unit’s mission.
     Sq/CC must ensure continuation training programs emphasize these areas. See minimum
     flying-hour requirements in Table 5.1
          5.3.1.1. Units should select upgrade candidates based on upgrade potential, retainability,
          and mission requirements.
             5.3.1.1.1. This instruction and ETCA, if applicable, list the pre-requisites and special
             requirements for formal school PIQ course. Units should work directly with their
             MAJCOM PFT quota managers (AD is AMC/A3TF) to fill available upgrade slots no
             later than 45 days before class start date.
          5.3.1.2. AC upgrade-PIQ (see Table 6.1) quotas will be allocated to MAJCOM by
          AETC/A3R PFT manager upon request.
          5.3.1.3. AC upgrade candidates must hand-carry copies of Category I training reports to
          formal school FTU or secondary course at McConnell AFB.

     5.3.2. Secondary Method Upgrade. For traditional copilots, formal school attendance is the
     primary method for of AC upgrade training. The secondary method may include completing
     the course academics phase (including ATD) at McConnell AFB and returning for in-unit
     flying training/evaluation.
          5.3.2.1. Conduct secondary method upgrade training by exception. For all secondary
          method upgrades, the unit will send a waiver request to MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent)
          staff (see paragraph 1.5.5). Several agencies will require coordination including
          AMC/A3T for copies of ATS courseware, etc. before approval.
          5.3.2.2. Secondary method academic and ATD training at McConnell AFB will be
          followed by return to home unit for SQ/CC directed flight training in preparation for
          evaluation per AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 2.
          5.3.2.3. Complete applicable ground and flying requirements of this instruction.

            reverse refueling training as an instructor-led ground training seminar. Annotate
            method of accomplishment for these events in the individual’s training record. As a
            minimum, complete one local and two missions (out and back) in the Enroute system
            before mission certification or as specified in local supplement.
     5.3.4. Global Ready Aircraft Commander Course (GRACC). GRACC is a three-phase
     process designed to familiarize pilots with all aspects of operating in the en route system. The
     three phases are divided as follows: Pilot to Aircraft Commander Phase I (V280), Pilot to
     Aircraft Commander Phase II (V281), and HQ AMC Orientation Tour (V282). See Chapter 7
     for course description.
        5.3.4.1. Applicability. GRACC training is required for active duty pilots upgrading to
        aircraft commander. GRACC is highly encouraged for mobility forces including AFRC
        and ANG pilots. A one-time course, completion is transferable between all mobility
        weapon systems. Waiver authority is OG/CC or equivalent.
        5.3.4.2. Documentation. Completion of each phase of GRACC is documented in ARMS
        (V280, V281, and V282). Document the completion of the entire course via the AF Form
        4324 as ―GRACC‖ using ARMS event identifier Q280.
        5.3.4.3. Training Guides. GRACC workbooks are available for download on the
        AMC/A3T CoP. Workbooks should be carried on all sorties to maximize training
        opportunities. Additional information on GRACC can be located on the ETCA website,
        https://etca.randolph.af.mil/showcourse.asp?as_course_id=GRACC.
        5.3.4.4. Phase I. Pilot To Aircraft Commander Phase I (V280). This phase consists of
        completing the V280 generic MAF workbook. MPD Pilots/copilots will complete this
        V280 workbook NLT 180 days after becoming mission ready. The workbook will help
        new pilots become familiar with moving a mission within the Mobility Enroute System
        and other associated requirements. For non-AMC unit or FAIP/OSA pilots transitioning
        to MAF aircraft, V280 will not be accomplished; however V281 and V282 are still
        required
        5.3.4.5. Phase II. Pilot To Aircraft Commander Phase II (V281). The second phase
        consists of completing a second MDS-specific workbook. V281 will serve to review all
        the objectives in Phase I (V280) with more MDS specific topics. Pilots will complete
        V281 before Phase III (V282) and starting their formal aircraft commander upgrade &
        certification course. Aircraft Commander candidates who have transferred from non-
        AMC units or FAIP/OSA assignments will complete V281 and V282 before AC
        certification during an R & C board. MAJCOMs may substitute an alternate aircraft-
        specific Training Guide for the Phase II Training Guide.
        5.3.4.6. Phase III. HQ AMC Orientation Tour Phase III (V282). The third phase visits
        HQ AMC and the 618 TACC. This event provides an in-depth look at selected 618
        TACC and AMC operations as well as an opportunity to interact with command senior
        staff. Ideally, this course should be completed by aircraft commander candidates after
        completing Phase II, but before attending formal aircraft commander upgrade training.
        V282 will be completed prior to AC certification.

5.4. Aircrew Instructor Program. Instructor candidates will be selected based on experience,
judgment, ability to instruct, flying skills, and technical knowledge. Use instructor upgrade
flying time prerequisites in Table 5.1 for pilots and Table 5.4 for navigators and boom
operators. These series of courses are designed to teach pre-selected pilots and boom operators
the fundamentals and concepts of instructing an aircrew member. The courses will lead to
qualification as KC-135 instructor pilot or instructor boom operator and includes ground, ATD,
and flight instruction in the KC-135 aircraft and its aircrew training programs. See the
appropriate crewmember instructor course syllabus for details.

   5.4.1. Units should identify and send the names of candidates to fill allocated instructor
   course quotas to HQ AMC/A3TF, or MAJCOM equivalent training quota managers no later
   than 45 days before class start date. See the appropriate syllabus for in-unit course training
   events.
   5.4.2. Pre-Instructor Course Training. Units will provide pre-attendance simulator or flying
   training to instructor course candidates before school attendance. The purpose of the
   additional flight or simulator training is to help prepare instructor candidates to instruct while
   performing the maneuvers. These events will be completed by the instructor candidate
   demonstrating to their instructor on how to perform the procedure and/or techniques that
   would assist other crew members. When applicable, the instructor candidate should provide
   instruction throughout the pre-course training. Complete the appropriate pre-attendance

NOTE:
    1. Pilots and boom operators require a one-time only certification flight under supervision
    of a like-specialty MPRS instructor. MPRS certification is required before unsupervised
    use of equipment and AAR Pod refueling operations in-flight.


     5.6.6. GATM (Block 40. X) Difference Training(Q040/Q041). Note: The GATM
     training program has been migrating from aircraft to simulator training; all FTU and
     instructor courses are being modified to GATM-only. Further guidance can be found in this
     publication and also in AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 3 and the KC-135 GATM Transition Guide
     (see AMC/A3TK CoP).
        5.6.6.1. Crewmembers will complete an initial A036, GATM Difference Course, (see
        Table 5.9) when their unit of assignment begins GATM conversion (receives Block
        40.X modified aircraft). The baseline KC-135 configuration for the unit GATM
        modification is Pacer CRAG (PC) Block 31. Crewmembers will be qualified in this
        configuration before GATM certification. (Note: Aircrew members attending FTU
        GATM courses and who are assigned to units who have not completed GATM
AFI11-2KC-135V1_452AMWSUP_I 17 FEBRUARY 2010                                                77


      modification will receive A035 GATM Block 40.X to Block 30.X Difference Course
      training).
         5.6.6.1.1. Units accomplishing an in-unit requalification training program may credit
         Block 40.X training simultaneously with Block 31 training where applicable.
         Because the Block 40.X difference training leads to a certification, the qualification
         evaluation should be in a Block 31 aircraft as applicable, see AFI 11-2KC-135
         Volume 2 for documentation.
      5.6.6.2. Wing (OSS/OST) / Squadron training instructors will manage the Block 40.X
      difference certification program. Core KC-135 bases will retain both PC Block 31 and
      GATM-modified aircraft and will                ensure all   crewmembers maintain
      qualification/currency in both configurations.
      5.6.6.3. Ground Training. ATS Contractor conducts all ground training consisting of
      Instructor Based Review (IBR) and CBTs plus 3 GATM OFT profiles. Crewmembers
      must complete CBT lessons A036A through A036L within 45 days before GATM OFT
      sessions A036M through A036O see Table 5.9 and Table 5.10.

Notes:
1. Unit instructors designated by SQ/CC will complete IOS training and certification to operate
the IOS.
2. Training tools: may use aircraft, OFT or the GATM Integrated-hand-controller Part Task
Trainer (GIPTT).

       5.6.6.4. GATM (Block 40.X) Flight Training. Flight training will be conducted in-unit
       (based on aircraft availability) by Block 40.X certified instructors with the exception of 3
       OFT Profiles conducted by ATS contractor. Sorties will emphasize systems operations
       and 3 person (4 person with a navigator) CRM. A required proficiency level (RPL) of
       ―3‖ equates to proficiency for that event. Document training closeout on AF Form 4025
       and place in training folder. Document certification as ―GATM—Certified‖, see Table
       5.10 ARMS event identifier is Q040 (see paragraph 1.8). GATM configured OFT may
       be used in place of aircraft flight.
       5.6.6.5. Data Link Training. Requires one additional ATS contractor OFT Profile
       (A036R) plus a certification sortie.
          5.6.6.5.1. Certification. Accomplish one overseas sortie operating in data link
          airspace to include an ―AFN Log On‖, three CPDLC position reports, message
          sending/receiving (e.g. altitude change, course offset, route change requests), and an
          ―End Service‖ message. Every attempt will be made to fly a route which includes a
          non-compulsory reporting point. If unable to fly a route that includes a non-
          compulsory reporting point, demonstrate editing the ―NEXT‖ waypoint in a CPDLC
          position report. The training program leading to data link certification may be
          accomplished in the ATD in place of the flight requirement. This training requires a
          Block 40.X data link certified Air Force instructor to accomplish the minimum
          requirements using the A036R GATM Data Link syllabus, focusing on the
          differences between Pacific and Atlantic operations. Accomplish training within 90
          days (180 days for ANG/AFRES) of completing the Block 40.X difference
          certification. Document training closeout on AF Form 4025 and place in training
          folder (May be documented with Q40, if applicable). Document certification as
          ―GATM—Data Link Certified,‖, see Table 5.10 Document in ARMS using event
          identifier Q041 (see paragraph 1.8). Units have the option to use a data link OFT
          profile in place of an overseas flight (see AMC/A3TK CoP for additional OFT
          guidance). Note: May be extended an additional 60 days with Sq/CC approval. If
          not accomplished within given time frame, crewmember must re-accomplish the data
          link ground training class prior to receiving flight training. Inform AMC/A3TK, of
          circumstances for non completion.

                                            Chapter 6

                            AIRCREW TRAINING SYSTEM (ATS)

6.1. Description. The KC-135 ATS is contractor-provided aircrew training system. The ATS
contractor provides qualification and continuation training courseware, academic instruction,
ATD operation/instruction and training facility management. The USAF provides all flight
instruction.
     6.1.1. The ATS contract guarantees trained students meet government standards. The Air
     Force validates training, conducts all flight training aboard the KC-135, and administers all
     evaluations according to AFI 11-202 Volume 2.
     6.1.2. Reports. For initial qualification training, the KC-135 ATS includes a post-training
     feedback system that elicits information and comments in critique format from students,
     supervisors, and evaluators. The program seeks to collect data to monitor the training while
     seeking to continually improve, update, and refine the ATS. Return critiques to: 97TRS/CC,
     510 North Sixth Street Suite 3, Altus AFB OK 73523-5089.
6.2. Applicability. As defined in AFI 11-202 Volume 1.
     6.2.1. Purpose. The KC-135 ATS is a system of academics, ATD sessions, ground and
     flight training phases. The system provides qualification, upgrade, and continuation training
     to attain and maintain the appropriate qualification for KC-135 pilots, navigators, and boom
     operators.
     6.2.2. Goal. The ATS program goal is to optimize aircrew training through the integrated
     use of academics, ATD, and flight-line KC-135 aircraft instruction. The KC-135 ATS has
     performance requirements in a Statement of Work (SOW) and system specification. The
     ATS follows the USAF-sponsored ISD process; developing (and maintaining) a Master Task
     Listing (MTL), Evaluation Standards of Document (ESD), Objective Media Analysis Report
     (OMAR), and Media Selection Syllabus Report (MSSR) products (approved by HQ
     AMC/A3T). These products help define each course content, standards, and training media
     selected for each task and objective.
     6.2.3. Responsibilities.
        6.2.3.1. ATS Contractor (see paragraph 1.4.7) will co-host a quarterly KC-135 ATS
        System Review Board (SRB) to outline the ATS program including currency,
        applicability, and effectiveness. Publish meeting minutes and monitor suspenses
        (specified in the ATS contract).
            6.2.3.1.1. ATS contractor maintain the OFT, WST, BOPTT, CPT, CLT, GIPTT,
            NPT and other devices or training aids, to enhance flight training programs. Schedule
            lessons, ATD missions and conduct mission overviews and debrief (by the ATS
            instructor) for each lesson. Provide all necessary data to complete the ATD mission
            or assigned task.
            6.2.3.1.2. The ATS contractor ensures instructors provide an environment for
            simulator training that is as realistic, as possible. Attention will be directed to crew
            coordination throughout all phases of flight. Crews will utilize equipment in the
AFI11-2KC-135V1_452AMWSUP_I 17 FEBRUARY 2010                                                 85

Notes:
1. Course duration/content is subject to change, see ETCA or syllabus for course details.
2. Aircraft commander requalification includes pilots previously qualified in the KC-135.
3. These courses have proficiency advancement option that allows for accelerated completion of
the flying portion of the training.
4. Block 40 Syllabus
5. Pilot course for senior officers (O-6 selectees and above) who will fly under instructor
supervision.
6. Instructor upgrade is available in-unit only (see paragraph 5.5.2.2.)

6.5. Lesson Objectives. Use lesson objectives as a reference to establish training and
evaluation standards. The KC-135 ATS use the Master Task List (MTL) and the Evaluation
Standards Document (MTL/ESD) available on the ATS Contractor website (see paragraph
1.15.).
   6.5.1. MTL and ESD Purpose. MTL and ESD provide the basis for ATS courseware
   development, and are a principle source for evaluation criteria (validate MDS crewmember
   performance).
       6.5.1.1. Courseware development and instructors training KC-135 crewmembers may
       use criteria from the MTL and ESD to help determine the ability of an individual to meet
       performance levels required to be mission-qualified. For evaluation, use AFI 11-2KC-
       135 Volume 2 criteria.
88                                  AFI11-2KC-135V1_452AMWSUP_I 17 FEBRUARY 2010


        6.5.1.2. Conduct the Air Force evaluation to ESD standards, in a timely manner
        subsequent to the trainee’s completion of the ground-based or flight training (to guarantee
        standards).
     6.5.2. Crew resource management (CRM) training. The KC-135 ATS incorporates CRM
     principles during all phases of training including initial and continuation training to meet
     requirements of AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program. A
     CRM facilitator course is also available, upon request. Instructors use AF Form 4031, CRM
     Skills Criteria Training/Evaluation, for CRM skills training IAW AFI 11-290.
6.6. Unsatisfactory Student Progress. See paragraph 1.16 Any time during a trainee’s ATS
ground instruction for formal school or unit-level continuation training, the ATS instructor
considers training progress is unsatisfactory, lack of preparation or participation, etc. the ATS
contractor will notify the unit training manager.
     6.6.1. Failure to Progress. If a student fails to progress according to syllabus requirements,
     the command accomplishing the training will conduct a Progress Review (PR). The PR can
     recommend continuation in training or AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service,
     Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, action, e.g., a Flying Evaluation Board (FEB) to the
     individual’s unit commander. The ATS contractor will identify students who fail to progress
     according to the ATS contract (see Chapter 6.)
        6.6.1.1. Failure to Complete Training. If crewmember fails to complete a formal course,
        the formal school (ATS contractor will notify AMC/A3TK for training deficiencies at
        McConnell AFB) will send a recommendation of action to the individual’s unit. The
        recommendation will specify if the student should complete training in-unit, return to the
        formal school to complete training, or be referred to the AF personnel system for
        reassignment.
6.7. Courseware Changes. See paragraph 1.3.1. While completing CBT, the user may also
submit a comment or proposed change at the point of instruction using a ―Control C‖ input. See
CBT on-screen instructions on the opening to each CBT lesson. The inputs are consolidated as
part of the CBT centralized reporting function. ATS contractor, in coordination with 97
TRS/TRQ (if applicable) will monitor ―Control C‖ inputs for consideration of future courseware
updates.
6.8. Scheduling.
     6.8.1. HQ AMC/A3TK ATS Manager, through KC-135 ATS Contracting office and training
     group (507 ASSC/GFLC) will determine FY ATS formal school and continuation training
     requirements (throughput) for all ATS courses. PFT reflects the planned annual formal
     school throughput based on Air Force requirements, formal school and ATD capacities, and
     contract authorizations. ATD simulator scheduling at formal school is managed by 97 TRS,
     Altus AFB in coordination with the ATS Contractor, Training Management System (TMS)
     scheduling office.
     6.8.2. Units with co-located ATS facility schedule directly with the local ATS site. Units
     without an ATS facility have been designated (by HQ AMC/A3TK ATS Manager) to
     ―QUEEN BEE‖ to ATS facilities. While an ATD undergoes conversions or hardware
     modifications the ATS management team or ATS contractor may request the host or QUEEN
     BEE unit aircrews divert to sites with available training capacity. The ATS contractors’
AFI11-2KC-135V1_452AMWSUP_I 17 FEBRUARY 2010                                                  89


   TMS office at Altus AFB and AMC/A3TK orchestrate the annual scheduling of KC-135
   pilots and QUEEN BEE sites in coordination with 507 ASSC/GFLC.
   6.8.3. Cancellation of ATS Formal School Course Quota. The ETCA request units notify
   their MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) staff (AMC AD call HQ AMC/A3TF) within 45 days
   before class start date if a quota cancellation or no-fill is pending. All formal school quota
   cancellations must be made no later than 30 days prior to class start date to enable the quota
   to be reallocated. For cancellations at McConnell AFB notify MAJCOM/A3T (or
   equivalent) staff immediately and site scheduler as early as possible to permit
   reallocation/rescheduling. Short notice cancellation of one student may result in the
   delay/cancellation of the paired pilot.
6.9. Administration.
   6.9.1. General. Recurring academic and ATD training ensures required subject training
   materials are presented in a realistic manner on a programmed/phased basis.
   6.9.2. Objective. Ensure all crewmembers maintain the proficiency to safely operate the
   KC-135 aircraft and effectively perform the assigned mission. Crewmembers utilize the
   ATD to enhance the training areas (e.g., windshear/microburst training, low visibility
   approaches, systems knowledge, emergency/abnormal procedures, degraded navigation
   systems, etc.).
6.10. Training Implementation/Student Expectations.
   6.10.1. Self-Study. Each crewmember is responsible for their adequate preparation before
   reporting for each ATD mission. Review the mission profile, pre-course study material,
   associated normal, abnormal, and emergency procedures, and applicable aircraft systems.
   Each pilot must review the applicable portions of the flight publications and answer review
   exercises questions located in the OFT profile.
   6.10.2. Pre-mission. The ATS instructor will conduct a pre-mission briefing before each
   OFT and cover the mission overview, academic session overview (if applicable), systems,
   aircraft loading, performance data, route-of-flight, communications, takeoff weather,
   simulator discrepancies, and OFT emergency egress. Also include mission objectives,
   special procedures specific (required) training items, scheduled systems and performance
   training, CRM, and any additional area of emphasis. Prior to executing the scheduled
   training event, the designated crewmember should conduct a mission briefing covering AFI
   11-2KC-135 Volume 3 required briefing items.
   6.10.3. Mission. The crew and ATS instructor will fly the ATD profile to maximum extent
   possible. For proper pacing, it is imperative the pilot team cope with simulated emergencies
   while continuing to fly the aircraft. Limit ―freezing the OFT‖ to meet training objectives.
   6.10.4. Post-mission. The ATS instructor will critique the crew’s performance during each
   phase of the mission. Several ATDs are equipped with Tdapps, a dual-screen simulator
   mission playback system. Complete post-mission documentation IAW Technical Order 00-
   20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policy and
   Procedures, to include AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work
   Documentation, AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance and

     ARMS products. Send requests or recommendations for additional training to the unit
     training manager. Accomplish additional training as soon as practical, schedule permitting.
6.11. Browsing Training Products. KC-135 crewmembers are encouraged to browse any and
all lessons existing within the ATS. This is particularly applicable to those personnel preparing
to enter upgrade courses, subject to the following restrictions:
     6.11.1. Browser time is on a space-available basis.
     6.11.2. All browser requests will be coordinated with the ATS training supervisor.
     6.11.3. Trainees are not to be scheduled to browse lessons for remediation. Remediation
     will be scheduled by coordinating with the ATS contractor. Browsing a lesson does not
     enable the trainee to take the end-of-lesson test. Trainees in remediation will be enrolled in
     lessons for review in order to take the end-of-lesson test and keep a permanent record of the
     remediation.
6.12. Aircraft Flights for ATS Training Instructors.
     6.12.1. ATS contractor provides opportunities for Air Force flight instructor to observe
     trainee progress in ATD. Likewise, KC-135 ATS simulator instructors may observe students
     during flight training according to AFI 11-401 and the terms and conditions of the current
     KC-135 ATS contract.
6.13. KC-135 ATS Facility Tours.
     6.13.1. Wing training offices will coordinate all requests for KC-135 ATS facility tours with
     the contractor as soon as possible, but in no case later than 24 hours before the planned event.
     This may require close coordination with public affairs and protocol. Air Force option time
     may be used at the discretion of the OG/CC. Tours will be on an as-available basis and will
     not displace scheduled training events.
     6.13.2. OG/CC will ensure an Air Force representative meets, greets, accompanies, and
     conducts all tours. The contractor is not manned for or on contract to perform these duties.
     The contractor shall be responsible for providing an aircrew training device operator only.
6.14. Aircrew Evaluation.
     6.14.1. General. The Air Force examiner’s decision as to the ability of the aircrew
     member’s ability to meet qualification levels as set forth in AFI 11-202, Volume 2 and AFI
     11-2KC-135 Volume 2, shall be final and will not be subject to question by the contractor.
     An AF Form 8 will be completed for all evaluations IAW AFI 11-2KC-135 Volume 2.

A2.1. General Information. This attachment provides guidelines on proper training
documentation. Instructions are provided for AF Form 4022, Aircrew Training Folder, AF Form
4023, Aircrew Training Progress Report, AF Form 4024, Aircrew Training Accomplishment
Report, and AF Form 4025, Aircrew Summary/Close-Out Report, and aircrew training guides.
These forms are prescribed in AFI 11-2C5 Volume 1, C5 Aircrew Training.
   A2.1.1. Create an AF Form 4022, for ETCA formal training courses (formal school or in-
   unit), mission qualification, special qualification, certification training, in-unit upgrade
   program to the next higher crew qualification, requalification training (formal school or in-
   unit), MPD, and all corrective action or additional training. (see AMC/A3T CoP, Universal
   Aircrew Training, for examples of AF Form 4022, 4023, 4024, 4025)
      A2.1.1.1. The unit operations officer may waive the training folder requirement if
      corrective action or additional training is limited. If initiated, the instructor or flight
      examiner who evaluated the aircrew member’s performance will enter comments
      pertinent to the training deficiency on AF Form 4023 or the training guide. Use the
      existing AF Form 4022 for end-of-course evaluations that result in additional training.
      A2.1.1.2. At the unit’s discretion, training folders for an individual undergoing more
      than one training program in a short period of time may combine all training into one AF
      Form 4022; e.g., a CP or MPD pilot upgrading to AC may have the upgrade, mission
      qualification, and formation lead training combined in one folder.
      A2.1.1.3. Electronic Training Folders are authorized. Electronic training folders and
      reports not reproduced on paper for inclusion in the AF Form 4022, must be stored in 2
      places (a primary and a backup) for at least one year.
          A2.1.1.3.1. Electronic versions must be password protected to ensure data integrity
          (Ensure individual has only read access to their files).
          A2.1.1.3.2. Digital signatures are authorized using ―//signed//‖ plus the individuals
          name.
   A2.1.2. Formal schools will send AF Form 4022 or aircrew training guide (formal
   schoolhouse only) with all training records to the trainee’s gaining unit. This may be done
   electronically at the gaining unit’s request. Sq/CC will review formal school training records
   and enter appropriate comments on the training guide progress record or AF Form 4023.
   A2.1.3. The unit (typically squadron-level) will maintain the training folders for assigned
   personnel in a location readily accessible to instructors and supervisory personnel. The
   trainee may review his or her folder at any time.
   A2.1.4. The instructor or trainer will review the training folder, to include AF Forms 4023
   and 4024 or the training guide, prior to all training periods. Those areas not previously
   accomplished or those in which crewmembers require additional training, will be noted for
   possible inclusion during the current training period. Sq/CC or Sq/DO will review active
   training folders quarterly, and flight commanders or squadron training representatives will
   conduct a monthly review. Annotate monthly and quarterly reviews on AF Form 4023 or in
152                               AFI11-2KC-135V1_452AMWSUP_I 17 FEBRUARY 2010


   the training guide. Quarterly reviews suffice for monthly reviews. Note: Due to the
   frequency of review, and brief course length at the FTU, the 97 OG/CC will determine the
   requirement to review student training documentation.
   A2.1.5. Upon completion of training, place hard copy of the AF Form 4025 in the
   individual’s flight training folder. Place a copy of the AF Form 4025 in the individuals FEF
   only if directed by the appropriate (e.g., AFI 11-202 Volume 2/MAJCOM Supplement, AFI
   11-2KC-135 Volume 2). Squadrons will retain all AF Forms 4022 for 1-year, then return to
   the crewmember, see paragraph A2.1.1.3. Document in ARMS per applicable event and
   paragraph 1.8
   A2.1.6. If training guides are not used, use AF Forms 4023, 4024, and 4025 for ATS and
   formal school courses.
   A2.1.7. For purposes of training documentation, classroom only training conducted at the
   unit should be identified as Academic Training (AT). Ground Training (GT) will be
   considered all training conducted outside the classroom not associated with a flight or ATD.
   All G series ground training referenced in this AFI will be referenced as (GT).
   A2.1.8. The AF 4324 will be used as a ―source document‖ for recording the various aircrew
   certifications. Completed/original AF 4324s will be kept on file in the unit ARMS office for
   the duration of the aircrew member’s assignment and released to the member upon
   reassignment. AF 4324, blocks 1-5 and 11-13, will be used to document any new aircrew
   certification and award of specific ARMS ―Q‖ code identifiers. Specifically, block 11 will
   contain the following minimum information: Q code (i.e. QXXX), Certification Name (i.e.
   ―GRACC‖), and date of certification. Forward completed for to the unit ARMS section for
   processing.

  applicability of items 2-8.
  A2.3.3. Total Training Time (Item 8). Keep a running total of all training time (add items 3,
  5, and 7).
  A2.3.4. Remarks and Recommendations (Item 9). Describe the mission scenario. Local
  overprints are authorized. Comments will elaborate on trainee strengths and weaknesses,
  identify problem areas, record unusual circumstances, and indicate student progress.
  Recommendations will be specific and include tasks requiring further training and the type of
  training required. If more space is required for annotating remarks, draw vertical arrows
  through sortie information heading section (Items 1 through 8) and continue remarks.
     A2.3.4.1. Operations Review. In addition to reviewing all AF Form 4023 entries, the
     flight commander or squadron training representative will conduct a monthly review of
     active status AF Forms 4022. The Sq/CC or designated representative will review active
     status AF Forms 4022 at least once each quarter. Document reviews on an AF Form
     4023. The reviewer will annotate ―monthly review‖ or ―quarterly review,‖ as applicable,
     in the training period block. Operations review will be annotated, and if required, a
     separate entry in the training record including comments on the student’s progress will be
     made. Initial reviews by Sq/CC’s fulfill the requirement for the monthly and quarterly
     review for the month and quarter the review was completed.
     A2.3.4.2. Monthly reviews are not required for formal school courses except in
     documented cases of unsatisfactory progress. In this case, flight commander initials on
     the AF Form 4023 or training guide satisfy this requirement. ATS personnel will review
     the student’s records and ensure all required training is completed prior to entering flight
     training. If problems are encountered during the flying phase, the squadron will conduct
     reviews necessary to document unsatisfactory progress.
     A2.3.4.3. When the trainee attains sufficient knowledge, experience, and prerequisites
     for upgrade, the instructor will recommend an evaluation and state: ―Recommend
     evaluation for (crew position)‖ on the training progress record. Trainees will not be
     recommended for an evaluation if a TG required event is incomplete or requires

   A2.3.8. Students and instructors will review the AF Form 4023 or training guide prior to the
   next training period. FORMAL SCHOOL COURSES ONLY: To ensure documentation
   flow does not delay training, once flight training begins, ATS instructors are not required to
   review the training folder, and may forward subsequent training reports to the flightline unit
   training representative electronically (electronic signatures authorized), who will review
   and insert the report into the student’s AF Form 4022 or training guide. Except in cases of
   unsatisfactory student performance, ATS training reports do not require student or instructor
   review prior to the next flight training period.
A2.4. Instructions for the AF FORM 4024. This form tracks, for each sortie, individual event
and task accomplishment and grades. Units will overprint event and task listings, total number

       event and task will have a performance standard designated for the required proficiency level
       the crewmember must achieve. In addition, each event and task may have (optional) a
       knowledge standard designated and used in the same manner as a performance standard. The
       standards for specific events are either listed in the applicable master task list (MTL) and
       evaluation standards document (ESD) for each weapon system or identified in this
       instruction. For those weapons systems that do not have any RPL listing, all events will have
       an RPL of ―3‖ for performance and ―C‖ for knowledge (if knowledge standards are used in
       addition to performance standards). EXCEPTION: One-time events required for
       familiarization and not listed in the MTL and ESD or specific weapon system instruction will
       not have performance and knowledge standard assigned. Performance and knowledge

                                   and safety without the assistance of an instructor. For
                                   copilots/MPD pilots, proficiency may involve actual aircraft
                                   control or copilot/pilot duties only. For instructors, proficiency
                                   includes the ability to demonstrate, instruct, and supervise
                                   ground and flight activity.

                                 theory involved with activities.
       A2.4.11.1. Regression. Once a crewmember has received ―P‖ for an event, the only
       subsequent grade allowed for that event is either ―P‖ or ―U‖. Regression occurs when a
       maneuver is graded ―U‖ after having achieved ―P‖ in the same task. Regression from a
       ―P‖ to a ―U‖ requires an associated remark on AF Form 4023explanation in the student’s
       training folder. The overall grade is at the instructor’s discretion. For regression, the
       student will re-obtain proficiency prior to the end of the block of training in order to be
       recommended for an evaluation (when applicable) or certification (when applicable).
A2.5. Instructions for AF FORM 4025.
    A2.5.1. For each training program complete a summary and close-out report, upon
    completion of the defined final training program events, including: Evaluation, IP ―sign-off‖
    and Sq/CC certification. This form details the individual’s strengths, weaknesses, overall
    performance, and other pertinent information. A copy of this report will be filed in the
    crewmembers training folder after completion of training. See paragraph A2.1.5
    A2.5.2. Sq/CC or designated representative will ensure the comments on AF Form 4025 do

     student will review the TG and initial the training progress record prior to the next
     training period.
     A2.6.3.2. Complete the training progress record portion of the TG in sufficient detail to
     specify areas of training accomplished, areas needing improvement, recommended
     specific study areas for the trainee, and recommended training for the next training
     period.
     A2.6.3.3. On missions without an instructor or examiner, the senior qualified counterpart
     (e.g., AC for copilots/MPD pilots, etc.) will accomplish required training for those areas
     not requiring an instructor. Annotate applicable training information in the TG.
     A2.6.3.4. When an initial qualification flight evaluation is not successfully completed
     and additional training is required, the flight commander will annotate deficient areas on
     reproduced pages of the appropriate TG and training progress record. Place the mini-TG

  A2.6.4. Review Procedures:
     A2.6.4.1. Instructors and students will review the TG after each training period and
     discuss training accomplished, problem areas, and immediate goals. To ensure
     documentation flow does not delay training, once flight training begins, ATS instructors
     are not required to review the training folder, and may forward subsequent training
     reports to the flight line unit training representative electronically (electronic signatures
     authorized), who will review and insert the report into the student’s AF Form 4022 or
     training guide. Except in cases of unsatisfactory student performance, ATS training
     reports do not require student or instructor review prior to the next flight training period.
     A2.6.4.2. The flight commander or squadron training representative will conduct a
     monthly review of TGs. This review will be indicated by entering initials and date in the
     review block of the TG.
     A2.6.4.3. The Sq/CC or designated representative will review active TG’s at least once
     each calendar quarter and before an evaluation. This review will be a separate entry on
     the TG and will include comments on weak areas and upgrade potential. Indicate review
     by signing the instructor-trainer block of the training progress record, and enter
     ―quarterly review‖ in the training period identifier block.
     A2.6.4.4. Records of crewmembers, not receiving training (but in an active status), will
     be reviewed monthly and quarterly as indicated above. If applicable, the statement, ―no
     training accomplished during this period,‖ the reason why, and the projected date when
     training will resume will be entered on the student’s training progress record.
  A2.6.5. Disposition of TGs:
     A2.6.5.1. Retain each (completed) TGs in AF Form 4022 and maintain according to
     paragraph A2.1.5
