1. Program Overview.
     1.1. The Welcome Center is designed to correlate with the INTRO program. All newly
     assigned Airmen are scheduled by the Personnel Employment section of the Manpower
     Personnel Flight (MPF) to attend the Welcome Center on their first scheduled Unit Training
     Assembly (UTA).
     1.2. The sponsorship program is oriented to the unit and unit work center. It forms a
     connection with newly assigned Airmen prior to their report date to Westover ARB or, in the
     case of a non-prior service Airman, the report date to Basic Military Training (BMT).
     1.3. Each unit commander’s involvement in these programs is vital to their success.
2. Program Responsibilities.
     2.1. Unit Commander.
        2.1.1. Establish a unit INTRO program and sponsorship program to meet the needs of the
        newcomer.
        2.1.2. Appoint a unit INTRO manager/unit sponsors. Each unit should have at least one
        sponsor appointed in writing from each section with a copy of the memorandum
        forwarded to Customer Service (Attachment 2, Sample Appointment Memorandum).
439AWI36-2101 25 JULY 2011                                                                     3


     2.1.3. Ensure copies of appointment memorandums are on file for INTRO managers and
     unit sponsors.
     2.1.4. Explain sponsor’s job requirements and responsibilities and ensure they are met.
     (Attachment 6, Sample Sponsor Appointment Memorandum)
     2.1.5. Ensure newly assigned Airmen are designated a sponsor upon assignment to the
     unit. Sponsors should be assigned a period of time long enough for the newcomer to feel
     they are part of the team and are familiar with their unit, their assigned base, and the Air
     Force Reserve. It is recommended that the sponsor be assigned for a minimum of three
     unit training assembly’s (UTA).
     2.1.6. Personally meet and welcome all newcomers and conduct the initial orientation
     briefing documented on AF Form 158, United States Air Force Reserve (USAFR)
     Contact and Counseling Record.
     2.1.7. Ensure a personalized welcome memorandum (Attachment 3, Sample Unit
     Welcome Memorandum) is sent to each new reservist’s home address. Whether the

     dates, contact needs to be established as soon as possible and maintained until the Airman
     returns from training and is participating with the unit.
     2.1.8. Ensure each newcomer is greeted at the Welcome Center at 1445 hours by the unit
     career advisor or unit representative on the Saturday of the A UTA.

     2.3.4. Organizes and schedules all speakers for the Welcome Center.
     2.3.5. Contacts unit first sergeant or commander support staff by 1000 hours if an
     Airman is a no-show to the welcome center. Report no-shows to Personnel Employment
     for follow-up action.
     2.3.6. Ensures a current memorandum, appointing INTRO program manager and unit
     sponsors, is received and kept on file for each unit.

     possible improvements to the program.

4                                                              439AWI36-2101 25 JULY 2011


       2.3.9. Provides an alternate location on base when there is over 30 Airmen scheduled for
       the Welcome Center.
    2.4. Personnel Employment.
       2.4.1. Maintains a welcome package that includes a base fact sheet, base and city map,
       welcome memorandums, and other miscellaneous items.
       2.4.2. Schedules newly assigned Airmen for the Welcome Center.
       2.4.3. Mails welcome package to Airman’s home address no later than one week prior to
       A UTA of each month.
       2.4.4. Prepares the monthly list of newcomers scheduled to attend the Welcome Center
       and makes the list available to the units.
       2.4.5. Is notified by Customer Service of newcomer no-shows, and reschedules the no-
       show for the next scheduled Welcome Center. Each Airman is notified of new report
       dates by mail. Subsequent no-shows are identified to the unit for appropriate action.
       2.4.6. Notifies Customer Service when the number of airmen meet a maximum of 30 to
       find an alternate location.
    2.5. Commander Support Staff (CSS).
       2.5.1. Coordinates with Military Personnel Flight (MPF); Personnel Employment, 557-

       of their inability to make the scheduled Welcome Center times. CSS updates Unit
       Training Assembly Payroll System (UTAPS) appropriately.
       2.5.2. Receives and coordinates all information regarding newly assigned Airmen to the
       proper agencies (i.e., immediate supervisor, duty section, unit career assistance advisor,
       sponsor).
       2.5.3. Assists in mailing out newcomer memorandums upon notification (i.e., enlistment
       orders, BMT orders, school orders, AF Form 1288, Application for Ready Reserve
       Assignment).
    2.6. Unit Career Assistance Advisor/INTRO Manager.
       2.6.1. Greets newcomers at the Welcome Center each Saturday of the A UTA, building
       1875 at 1445. If unavailable, ensures that a unit representative is present.
       2.6.2. Schedules time for both the unit commander and first sergeant to meet with the
       newcomer as soon as possible during the first UTA.
       2.6.3. Ensures initial orientation is conducted, documented on AF Form 158, and filed in
       the Airman’s personal information folder.
       2.6.4. Works with sponsors/supervisors to ensure the Airman’s smooth transition into the
       unit and helps to identify problem areas.
    2.7. Unit Sponsors.
       2.7.1. Makes contact with the newly assigned Airmen prior to the first scheduled UTA
       via memorandum (Attachment 4, Sample Sponsor Memorandum). Let the newcomer
       know you are there to provide information and assistance to make the new assignment go
439AWI36-2101 25 JULY 2011                                                                     5


     as smoothly as possible. Listen to the Airman. Many times a newcomer’s stress can be
     reduced by merely talking to someone “already there.”
     2.7.2. For Airmen awaiting BMT and/or technical training school through the delayed
     enlistment program, commonly referred to as the Delayed Entry Program (DEP), it is a
     good idea to begin contact immediately. The amount of time the Airman has to wait for
     ship dates can have an adverse effect on their morale. Establishing and maintaining
     contact with the Airman right away can help them feel a part of the unit during this time.
     (Attachment 7, Sample BMT Welcome Memorandum)
     2.7.3. Upon return from BMT and technical training, make contact with the Airman prior
     to the first scheduled UTA. Congratulate them on completion of training and make
     arrangements to meet with them on their 1st UTA at Westover. (Attachment 8, Sample
     Technical School Return Memorandum)
     2.7.4. Make sure newcomers are familiarized with the base and surrounding area (i.e.,
     dining facility, clothing issue, security forces, Base Exchange, etc.).
     2.7.5. Treat newcomers as welcome additions to the unit assisting them individually
     from the day they enter the unit until they become adjusted to their new unit.
  2.8. Immediate Supervisor.
     2.8.1. Ensures sponsor is assigned to assist the newcomer and that all responsibilities are
     fulfilled. Also, ensures sponsor is available during duty hours or schedule someone to
     replace them if the original sponsor is unavailable.
     2.8.2. Introduces newcomer to duty section personnel and familiarizes the Airman with
     the work center’s operation and responsibilities. Explains how this fits in with the overall
     mission of the unit, 439th Airlift Wing, and the Air Force Reserve.
     2.8.3. Explains work center policies; i.e., duty hours, how to contact supervisor, breaks,
     smoking areas, uniform of the day, commander’s call, Inspector General complaint
     system, review of on-the-job training records, course development completion training
     plan, etc. (Attachment 5, Sample Unit Orientation Procedures).
