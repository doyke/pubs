SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Significant
revisions include: re-naming the AFI to correctly align its name with its content; incorporating
guidance issued under Guidance Memoranda 1, 2, and 3 to the 17 June 2009 version of AFI 90-
201; a chapter outlining commanders’ responsibility to inspect; a chapter dedicated to Inspector
General force development & management; incorporating changes to nuclear inspection policy;
clarification of policy regarding the management and use of Headquarters Air Force (HAF)
checklists; clarification of deficiency tracking requirements; Gatekeeper policy; and inclusion of
numerous attachments to assist inspectors. This document provides guidance that will transition
the Air Force Inspection System (AFIS) from one steeped in Cold War philosophy to an AFIS
that emphasizes command responsibility, decreases the number of days on a wing’s calendar
impacted by external inspections, and provides greater visibility over programs and processes
executed at the wing level, while effectively meeting the challenges of increasing efficiencies
and decreasing resources. At the end of some chapters, a few statements regarding the future
state of inspections will help Airmen understand where the AFIS is headed and enable smart,
decentralized decisions to move closer toward the objective of a substantially improved
inspection system.

(AFSPC) This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

                                            Chapter 1

                    GENERAL GUIDANCE AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Applicability. Unless otherwise stated, this Instruction applies to all inspections, as defined
in paragraph 1.2.2, conducted on or by any United States Air Force (USAF) organization,
including those forces assigned/apportioned to Combatant Commands.
1.2. Overview.
   1.2.1. The Air Force Inspection System. The Air Force Inspection System (AFIS) is an
   integrated, synchronized system of inspections conducted on behalf of the Secretary of the
   Air Force (SECAF), the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) and commanders at all
   levels.
       1.2.1.1. Inspection is an inherent function of command exercised at every level to
       evaluate readiness, economy, efficiency, and state of discipline. Inspection preparation,
       if not directly aligned with mission readiness, is inherently wasteful. Units will be
       inspection ready when commanders focus on mission readiness and on building a culture
       of disciplined compliance in which every Airman does his/her job right the first time
       when no one’s looking. The intent of the Inspector General is to continuously improve
       the AFIS so there is an ever-shrinking difference—both real and perceived—between
       mission readiness and inspection readiness.
   1.2.2. Inspection. An inspection is any effort to evaluate an organization, function or
   process by any means or method, including surveys, interviews, assessments, performance
   evaluations and those audits not conducted under the authority of the Air Force Audit
   Agency (AFAA). Inspections include special visits, technical inspections, special one-time
   inspections, inspections required by law or for the exercise of command responsibilities, and
   inspections conducted by functional staff (Functional) entities to provide or obtain technical
   information or assistance.
       1.2.2.1. The Judge Advocate General (TJAG), The Auditor General (TAG) and The
       Inspector General (TIG) have statutory authority and responsibility to conduct
       inspections and audits, which must guarantee independence, instill confidence in the
       system, and be free of an appearance of undue influence. TJAG, TAG, TIG and their
       authorized representatives must coordinate their inspections and audits with the
       appropriate Gatekeeper. Gatekeepers do not have the authority to approve/disapprove
       Article 6 inspections (TJAG), AFAA audits (TAG) nor AFIA and SAF/IGI inspections
       (TIG-directed); however, Gatekeepers have the most comprehensive view of unit
       activities and can facilitate optimum scheduling. The inspection requirements, policies,
       and procedures for Article 6 Inspections will be determined by TJAG.
   1.2.3. Inspections are the responsibility of commanders at all levels IAW Title 10 United
   States Code (USC) Section 8583, Requirement of Exemplary Conduct. Inspections are
   conducted by a commander, or on behalf of a commander, on their staff and subordinate
   units/organizations. Inspections are performed by authorities inside the inspected unit (i.e.,
   Internal Inspections) and outside the inspected unit (i.e., External Inspections).

     1.2.4. When differences arise concerning inspections governed by this Instruction
     (prioritized requirements, duplicative inspections, frequency, scope, etc.), this publication
     will take precedence in these matters over other Air Force policy and guidance.
1.3. Purpose of the AFIS. The purpose of the AFIS is threefold:
     1.3.1. To enable and strengthen commanders’ effectiveness and efficiency.
     1.3.2. To motivate and promote military discipline, improved unit performance, and
     management excellence up and down the chain of command, in units and staffs.
     1.3.3. To identify issues interfering with effectiveness, efficiency, compliance, discipline,
     readiness, performance, surety and management excellence.
1.4. Objectives of the AFIS.
     1.4.1. The AFIS is focused on assessing and reporting a unit’s readiness, economy,
     efficiency, and state of discipline to execute assigned missions. The AFIS gives SECAF,
     CSAF and commanders at all levels an independent assessment of:
        1.4.1.1. Unit compliance with established directives and ability to execute its assigned
        mission, leadership effectiveness, management performance, and aspects of unit culture
        and command climate (e.g., military discipline, respect, efficiency, safety, Wingman
        concept).
        1.4.1.2. A unit’s ability to find, analyze, report and fix deficiencies.
        1.4.1.3. A unit’s ability to prevent Fraud and minimize Waste and Abuse.
     1.4.2. The AFIS gives MAJCOM, National Guard Bureau (NGB) and HAF Functionals an
     independent assessment of functional effectiveness and compliance in the field, and of the
     adequacy of organization, policy, guidance, training and resources.
     1.4.3. The AFIS provides a mechanism for senior AF leaders to direct a targeted, more
     detailed and thorough inspection of specific programs, organizations, or issues.
     1.4.4. The AFIS can provide the instrument for units/organizations to receive required
     functional certifications.

        and establishing objectives for inspection programs through appropriate commanders;
        coordinating efforts to eliminate duplication and unnecessary inspections imposed on
        commands or units; and approving Air Force inspection policy. With the exception of
        TJAG inspections and TAG audits, all inspections conducted within the AF are subject to
        review by TIG for adherence to the objectives and policies contained in this Instruction.
        1.5.1.2. Has the authority to coordinate, synchronize, integrate, and approve/disapprove

                                           Chapter 2

         THE AIR FORCE INSPECTION SYSTEM—PROGRAM GUIDELINES

2.1. Definition of ―Unit‖. For the purposes of this Instruction, a ―unit‖ is defined as a wing or
wing-equivalent organization. MAJCOMs will determine inspection requirements for other
organizations in the command. Refer to Chapter 7 for FOA/DRU inspection requirements.
   2.1.1. (Added-AFSPC) AFSPC Unit Responsibilities. Reference Attachments 10 - 15.
2.2. Inspections. Inspections are planned, coordinated and conducted to ensure units and
subordinate organizations are properly organized, trained, equipped and supported to achieve
their required capabilities and execute their assigned missions. Inspections include a broad range
of activities designed to evaluate mission readiness, economy of resources, unit efficiency and
state of discipline. Inspection results also help commanders identify systemic problems and
improve quality of life for Airmen and their families.
   2.2.1. Internal Inspections. Internal Inspections are the foundation of the AFIS, promoting
   responsibility and accountability within the unit and allowing commanders to control the
   depth, scope and frequency of inspections.
   2.2.2. External Inspections. External inspections ensure the AFIS provides an independent,
   transparent and accountable assessment of readiness, economy, efficiency and state of
   discipline. Additionally, external inspections validate and verify internal inspections.
       2.2.2.1. External inspections include:
           2.2.2.1.1. MAJCOM/IG Inspections.
           2.2.2.1.2. Staff Assistance Visits (SAV). SAVs help a unit better understand the
           intent of higher headquarters policy and gives Functional staffs an opportunity to
           provide training to the unit. SAVs help MAJCOMs and HAF Functional staffs
           identify potential resource constraints and develop accurate guidance/policy. SAVs
           are conducted by MAJCOM or HAF Functional staffs and only at the request of the
           unit commander. All SAVs will be coordinated with the MAJCOM Gatekeeper.
           SAVs will not be given a rating and will not be used as a tool to prepare a unit for a
           formal IG inspection. SAVs will not be mandated by AFI.
           2.2.2.1.3. Other Approved Functional/Staff Assessments listed in Attachment 2 of
           this Instruction.
2.3. Commanders’ Duty to Inspect. IAW 10 USC § 8583, commanders will conduct Internal
Inspections and actively support and participate in External Inspections affecting their unit(s).
Refer to Chapter 6 for further guidance.
2.4. Inspector General Authority. SAF/IG and its subordinate inspectors (to include AFIA,
MAJCOM IG and Wing IG) derive their authority from The Inspector General's statutory and
regulatory authority.
   2.4.1. Inspector Certification. All IG inspectors (to include inspector augmentees) will be
   properly trained (see Chapter 8), certified in writing and sworn-in by oath (See Attachment
   5). The MAJCOM/IG will certify that all inspectors, to include inspector augmentees,
18                                              AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013


  assigned to an inspection team have completed appropriate AF and MAJCOMspecific
  inspector training. Inspector certification requires completion of prerequisite and mandatory
  training, as well as field observation. Field observation requirement is a minimum of one
  over-the-shoulder inspection by a certified inspector.
     2.4.1.1. MAJCOM/IGs can delegate to inspection Team Chiefs the authority to certify
     inspector augmentees on an interim basis for one month. MAJCOM/IGs will review
     Team Chief interim certifications and approve/disapprove full certification based on
     completion of requirements and the Team Chief’s recommendation.
     2.4.1.2. All certifications—interim and full—will be documented and filed IAW the AF
     Records Disposition Schedule in AFRIMS. Until the inspector is certified, the inspector
     must perform their inspection duties under the direct supervision of a certified inspector.
     Assigned IG inspectors must be certified within 6 months of being assigned to the IG.
     2.4.1.3. Non-nuclear MAJCOM inspectors are required to complete the AF Basic
     Inspector Course (BIC) and a field observation of either a Phase 0 Compliance Inspection
     or a Phase 1 & 2 Readiness Inspection.
     2.4.1.4. Nuclear MAJCOM, AFIA and Wing IG inspectors, in addition to the
     requirements in paragraph 2.4.1.3, will also complete the AF Nuclear Surety Inspector
     Course if their duties involve inspection of a nuclear surety mission. An over the
     shoulder Nuclear Surety Inspection (NSI) or Nuclear Operational Readiness Inspection
     (NORI) satisfies the Phase 0 or 1 & 2 requirement.
     2.4.1.5. Wing Inspector General. Wing IGs will receive training IAW paragraph 8.4.2.
     and be certified by their wing commander. Wing IGs will certify that all inspectors
     assigned to the wing’s inspection team have completed appropriate AF and
     MAJCOMspecific inspector training.
  2.4.2. IG Oath. Officers, NCOs, and DAF civilians serving as inspectors will take the IG
  oath. The oath reminds all IG personnel of the special trust and confidence inherent in their
  positions, and of the need for impartial, independent evaluation on behalf of the commander.
     2.4.2.1. Administering the Oath. The commander, as the directing authority, should
     administer the oath to the command IG (at a minimum) and every IG serving in the IG
     staff section, preferably in a public forum where a significant portion of the command
     may witness it. If the commander is unable to administer the oath to all IGs in the staff
     section, the command IG will administer it instead. Assigned IGs will administer the
     oath to IG inspector augmentees. Contractor personnel working in an IG staff section
     will not take the IG oath.
     2.4.2.2. Re-administering the Oath. When a commander departs the command, the
     command IG may choose to execute another IG oath with the incoming commander as a
     way to express to that new commander the special relationship shared by both
     individuals. However, a new oath is not required. If an IG moves to an IG staff section in
     another command, the IG will execute a new oath with his or her new commander. All
     individuals with prior IG experience who are nominated for a second, nonconsecutive IG
     detail must execute the IG oath upon arriving at his or her new command.
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                           19


  2.4.3. Valid Period of Inspector Authority. An inspector’s authority is valid only for the
  period of time he/she is a certified inspector and performing official inspection activities.
  2.4.4. Use of Contractors as IG inspectors. Contractors are prohibited from acting in the
  capacity of an IG inspector since IG duties are an inherently governmental function per the
  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 and IAW the Federal Activities
  Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act of 1998. However, contractors may participate in an
  inspection as subject-matter experts (SME) gathering information for, or providing advice,
  opinions, recommendations or ideas to a government member of the IG. While contractors
  can act as ―sensors‖ providing information to the IG, the IG must make all decisions related
  to the inspection, including schedule, sample selection, deficiency assignment, deficiency
  severity, major graded areas (MGA) grades and overall ratings. Use of contractors must be
  in compliance with DOD Instruction 1100.22, Guidance for Determining Workforce Mix.
  2.4.5. Access to Information and Spaces. To carry out their responsibilities, Air Force IGs
  shall have expeditious and unrestricted access to and, when required, be given copies of all
  records, reports, investigations, audits, reviews, documents, papers, recommendations, or
  other material available to or within any USAF activity. While performing official duties as
  an inspector, IGs will be granted access to any and all documents, records, and evidentiary
  materials needed to discharge their duties, to include data stored in electronic repositories.
  Some examples are classified documents, records of board proceedings, acquisition
  information, medical records, medical quality assurance records, drug and alcohol records,
  financial records, evaluation reports, back-channel messages, security dossiers, criminal
  investigation reports (as permitted by law and applicable regulations), and financial
  disclosure statements. This authority includes direct access to pertinent extracts as allowed
  by applicable regulations.
  2.4.6. Access to medical records. When accessing medical records, IGs must remain aware
  that health care information is sensitive medical information, is protected by Public Law
  104–191, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and must be
  protected. Accordingly, IGs must comply with all HIPAA release forms or requests and
  maintain the information in a safe, secure, and confidential manner.
  2.4.7. Restricted access. IGs are not authorized access to material subject to the attorney
  client privileged or other legal privileged information involving DoD personnel individually
  represented by legal counsel, such as by an Area Defense Counsel or legal assistance
  attorney. However, any such privilege can be waived by the represented individual.
  2.4.8. Access to classified or sensitive information. As part of an inspection, investigation or
  other directed inquiry, assigned IGs have a "need to know" and will forward a visit request
  through the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) to the security management office
  (SMO) determined by the unit, for further distribution throughout the unit. Access to
  classified information will be IAW AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management.
  If compartmentalization or classification restrictions preclude immediate access to
  information required by an IG, the denying commander will immediately report the situation
  to the appropriate access-control authority and obtain an access-eligibility determination. If
  this authority does not grant access to the information, the IG will notify the commander and
  SAF/IGI of the situation. The notice to SAF/IGI will include the location, date, and
 20                                               AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013


   command; scope of the assistance inquiry, inspection, or investigation; who denied access;
   who verified denial and approved denial; and the reason access was denied.
   2.4.9. Special Access Programs. The Air Force Inspector General (SAF/IG) is responsible
   for performing program security, inspection, investigation and counterintelligence functions
   for all AF SAPs and for maintaining a sufficient cadre of inspectors, investigators, special
   agents, analysts and program security officers (PSOs) to do so. Through AFOSI, SAF/IG will
   appoint a SAP Security Director to execute SAP security and security oversight
   responsibilities, under the authority of the Air Force SAP Central Office (SAPCO), for all
   Air Force SAPs and non-AF SAPs where the AF has been assigned responsibility. The
   SAF/IG or a designated representative may attend any Special Access Required Programs
   Oversight Committee (SPOC), Special Programs Review Group (SPRG) and SAP Oversight
   Review Board (SORB) meeting. SAF/IG may propose an inspection, assessment or
   management review of a SAP or SAP function to the Secretary of the Air Force after
   obtaining the views of SAF/AA. SECAF approval of a proposed SAF/IG inspection,
   assessment or management review establishes SAP access ―need to know‖ for the SAF/IG
   assigned and credentialed personnel required to accomplish such inspection, assessment or
   management review activities. In addition to the ―need to know‖, these credentialed
   personnel must meet the SAP access eligibility requirements outlined in AFI 16-701, Special
   Access Programs as do individuals who conduct SAF/IG investigations (SAF/IG
   investigations establish their own ―need to know‖). Unless the Secretary directs otherwise,
   all SAF/IG inspections, assessments or management reviews of a SAP or SAP activity will
   be coordinated with the Director, SAF/AAZ.
   2.4.10. Access Control and Routine Searches. Inspector General personnel properly
   identifying themselves as representatives of the IG and properly identified on a signed,
   authenticated IG Entry Authority List (EAL) shall be authorized entry to Protection Level
   resources via established entry procedures identified in AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense
   (FOUO) and DODS 5210-41-M, Volumes 1-3_AFMAN 31-108, The Air Force Nuclear
   Weapon Security Manual.
2.5. AF Inspection Requirements. MAJCOM/IGs will use Attachment 3 as an authoritative
source of HAF-level inspection requirements and will tailor inspection sampling strategies for
each inspected unit from the requirements listed in Attachment 3. Sampling from Attachment
3 adds a critical no-notice component to the AFIS. MAJCOM/IGs will not divulge the intended
inspection sample to the unit prior to the inspection inbrief. HAF Directorates will periodically
review and update applicable inspection requirements in Attachment 3 through SAF/IGI for
coordination/approval via the Inspection System Governance Process (see paragraph 2.18.).
2.5. (AFSPC) Reference        Attachment     3    for   additional   AFSPC-level      inspection
requirements.
2.6. Inspection Frequency.
   2.6.1. Air Force policy is that commanders at wing level and below should receive at least
   one major IG inspection during their command tour.
   2.6.2. Active Duty Units. CUI Phase 0, 1 and 2 requirements must be completed within 48
   months, while striving to complete these requirements within 24 months.
   2.6.3. Classic-Associate TFI Units.
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                          21


       2.6.3.1. Active Duty Unit in the Classic Association.    CUI Phase 0, 1 and 2
       requirements must be completed within 48 months, while striving to complete these
       requirements within 24 months.
       2.6.3.2. ARC Unit in the Classic Association. CUI Phase 0, 1 and 2 requirements must
       be completed within 48 months and will participate with their AD counterpart during
       scheduled CUI Phase 0, 1 and 2 inspections. MAJCOM/IGs will coordinate with the AD
       and ARC unit CCs of Classic Associate units to determine reasonable/practical scope and
       scale of AD and ARC participation in scheduled inspections.
   2.6.4. Unit-Equipped ARC, Active-Associate TFI and ARC-Associate TFI units. CUI Phase
   0, 1 and 2 requirements must be completed within 60 months, while striving to complete
   these requirements within 48 months.
2.7. Air Force Inspection Scheduling Process. The purpose of the AF Inspection Scheduling
Process is to synchronize inspection efforts to maximize wing training days and inspection
resource utilization; build out-year schedules; and align non-AF inspection requirements with AF
inspection schedules. AFIA will coordinate work with MAJCOM/IGs to publish and update as
necessary a consolidated AF Inspection Schedule NLT 1 Mar each year for the next two fiscal
years, and a tentative schedule for the subsequent 2 fiscal years. For example, by 1 Mar 2012,
AFIA will publish the AF Inspection Schedule via an access-controlled website for FY13-14 and
a tentative schedule for FY 15-16. AFIA will host an annual AF-wide scheduling conference to
facilitate effective and efficient scheduling. MAJCOM/IGs and supporting Functional inspection
team leads will support pre-conference data requests and ensure the Gatekeeper or appropriate
representative attends the conference.
   2.7.1. Scheduling ROE. NGB-IG and MAJCOM/CG/CGG advisors will assist gaining
   MAJCOM/IG Gatekeepers with deconfliction between MAJCOM/IG inspection schedules
   and ANG unit AEF, mobilization and force structure changes.
2.8. MAJCOM Inspection Programs—General Guidelines. MAJCOM/IGs will establish
inspection programs consistent with Mission Directive responsibilities and in accordance with
AF inspection guidelines outlined in this Instruction.
   2.8.1. MAJCOM/IGs will conduct independent inspections to assess unit readiness,
   economy, efficiency, state of discipline and nuclear surety (as applicable) and report results
   of such inspections as required by MAJCOM/CC and this Instruction.
   2.8.2. Gatekeeper. Gatekeepers at all levels must ensure the inspection system is able to
   independently and efficiently inspect units on behalf of the command chain. Gatekeepers
   ensure a commander’s priorities take precedence over non-mission-essential activities of any
   unit/organization. Gatekeepers have the authority to approve or disapprove, schedule, de-
   conflict and eliminate duplication between all inspection-type activities on behalf of their
   commander. Gatekeepers do not have authority to approve or disapprove TJAG Article 6
   inspections, TAG-directed audits, TIG-directed AFIA/SAF/IGI inspections, or inspection-
   type activity conducted by properly authorized DoD or other USG agencies (e.g., OIG, DOD;
   GAO, DISA; DTRA). In these cases, Gatekeepers should attempt to deconflict the
   inspections by offering optimum windows for the appropriate units. MAJCOM/CCs should
   delegate MAJCOM Gatekeeper authority and responsibility to their MAJCOM/IG to perform
   Gatekeeper functions for all inspection-type activity within their MAJCOM.
 22                                               AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013


       2.8.2.1. MAJCOM Gatekeeper functions include the ability to establish/maintain
       situational awareness and to integrate, synchronize and de-conflict unit inspections,
       assessments and evaluations within their MAJCOM. Gatekeeping unit inspections may
       include tracking organizations below the wing level as needed.
       2.8.2.2. Any agency planning to inspect, assess, evaluate, audit, assist, visit, or observe
       an Air Force unit/organization must contact the MAJCOM Gatekeeper as early as
       possible, and no later than 30 days prior to the desired visit.
       2.8.2.2. (AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/IG will notify the host base Gatekeeper prior to
       inspecting AFSPC tenant units.
       2.8.2.3. MAJCOM supplements to this publication may include MAJCOM/CC priorities
       to assist Gatekeepers in their roles (e.g., calendar ―white space‖, inspection frequency
       requirements, and waiver criteria) as well as guidance for inspecting multi-MAJCOM or
       Joint Base installations, if applicable. MAJCOM supplements to this publication will be
       coordinated with SAF/IGI.
       2.8.2.4. Gatekeepers at all levels should refer to Attachment 2 (Table of AF-approved
       inspections) to assist them in their Gatekeeper process.
          2.8.2.4.1. AF Agency Access to Inspect. Any AF agency requesting access to an
          installation for the purpose of conducting inspections (refer to paragraph 1.2.2.)
          must ensure the activity is on the list of AF-approved inspections (Attachment 2). If
          not, contact SAF/IGI IAW the process outlined in paragraph 2.18.2. If the
          Gatekeeper determines the requestor is not on the list of AF-approved inspections, the
          Gatekeeper should deny access to the installation and direct the requestor to follow
          the procedures in paragraph 2.18.2 to request the activity be vetted by the Inspection
          System Governance Process for addition to Attachment 2.
          2.8.2.4.2. Non-AF Agency Access to Inspect. Any non-AF agency (DOD, DTRA,
          DISA, GAO, etc.) requesting access to an installation to conduct inspection-type
          activity should contact AFIA and request liaison with appropriate MAJCOM
          Gatekeeper. Gatekeepers should make every effort to accommodate the request while
          balancing the need to guard wing whitespace through synchronization. Gatekeepers
          will notify SAF/IGI when a non-AF agency requests access for an activity not listed
          in Attachment 2.
          2.8.2.4.3. Non-AF Agency Request for Inspection Observation Access. Agencies
          external to the Air Force will coordinate requests to observe IG inspections through
          AFIA (primary) or SAF/IGI (secondary) for SAF/IG approval. Upon approval, AFIA
          will also serve as the liaison to coordinate with all external agencies requesting
          support and observer actions.
2.9. Pre-inspection considerations.
   2.9.1. Inspection alignment with the AEF-Next battle rhythm. Inspections should be de-
   conflicted with AEF-Next battle rhythm, enabler unit deployments, expeditionary support
   deployments and unit force structure changes. Inspections will be tailored, as necessary, to
   allow requisite unit support to the COCOM. MAJCOM/IGs will make final determination of
   scheduling and tailoring.
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                          23


  2.9.2. All inspection authorities will consolidate inspections to avoid redundancy. Eliminate
  inspections that are not mission-relevant, do not outweigh their costs, or detract from mission
  performance or readiness.
     2.9.2.1. On-site inspections should evaluate areas the MAJCOM/CC determines to be
     essential for commander and mission effectiveness, and particular conditions of the
     command.
     2.9.2.2. Inspections will focus on programs and processes that impact mission readiness,
     economy, efficiency, and state of discipline.
     2.9.2.3. When scheduling inspections for units gained by multiple MAJCOMs,
     MAJCOM/IGs will coordinate the inspection schedules to conduct concurrent MAJCOM
     inspections, to the maximum extent possible.
  2.9.3. IG Reciprocity. If a MAJCOM IG team is inspecting in an area where another
  MAJCOM has a small geographically separated unit (GSU) or Detachment (Det) (as a tenant
  for instance), the tenant/GSU/Det’s owning MAJCOM IG may ask the other IG Team to
  inspect their unit(s) for efficiency. MAJCOM/IGs or their representatives should coordinate
  with one another to ensure the inspection team has adequate subject-matter expertise to
  conduct the inspection IAW this Instruction and MAJCOM/CC direction.
  2.9.4. Limiting factors, simulations and deviations. The inspected unit will submit any
  known limiting factors (LIMFAC), simulations (SIM) and deviations (DEV) that could
  potentially affect the inspection's outcome to the inspection team chief. Any such LIMFAC,
  SIM, or DEV from authorized policy and guidance will be coordinated with the
  MAJCOM/IG. Approved LIMFACs, SIMs and DEVs which may impact inspection
  processes and outcomes will be announced to all inspectors prior to the commencement of
  any inspection activities.
  2.9.5. Entry Authority List. The EAL will be sent to the host the Wing’s Security office at
  the location of the inspection for dissemination to inspected units/organizations.
  2.9.6. Inspection Footprint. IG Team Chiefs will work with the inspected unit prior to the
  inspection to ensure there is a shared understanding of inspection constraints due to space,
  security, escort ratio, etc. The Team Chief will attempt to minimize the inspector footprint to
  the maximum extent practical; however, the Team Chief will make the final determination on
  inspector footprint to ensure adequate access for the inspectors.
     2.9.6.1. MAJCOM/IGs may consider unit activity in conjunction with exercises and
     contingencies, real world operations, self-assessments, other inspections/evaluations,
     sampling techniques, and other measures of sustained performance. These measures can
     be used to grant inspection credit, or adjust the breadth, duration, and incidence of
     inspection activities.
     2.9.6.2. When practical, IG teams may deploy to forward locations and headquarters
     during exercises and contingency operations to evaluate processes and performance.
     Inspectors may observe, but will not interfere with, real world activities unless observed
     actions are in direct violation mandated guidance or if injury to personnel and/or damage
     to equipment could occur.

   2.9.7. IG Team Work Center Requirements. The MAJCOM/IG Team Chief will coordinate
   specific work center requirements with the inspected unit. Additionally, the inspected unit
   will provide at least one dedicated person for the duration of the inspection to answer and
   screen work center calls for the IG inspection team.
2.10. Inspection Notification. For active duty (AD) units, notification for regularly scheduled
inspections will be determined by the MAJCOM/IG for each inspection type. MAJCOM/IGs
will notify ARC units of regularly scheduled inspections with a minimum one year notice.
Additionally, MAJCOM/IGs (or designee) will send an Inspection Commencement Message for
all IG inspections, NLT 24 hours after inspection in-brief. Provide Inspection Commencement
Message to all appropriate agencies through the use of Attachment 4, Figure A4.1 of this
Instruction.
   2.10.1. No-Notice and Minimal-Notice Inspections.        No-notice and minimal-notice
   inspections are conducted to assess a unit’s day-to-day readiness to execute assigned
   missions, compliance with established directives and nuclear surety (as applicable). The
   MAJCOM/CC will determine the need for no-notice and minimal-notice inspections.
   2.10.1. (AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/IG will annually post an inspection schedule (broken out by
   quarters) on the HQ AFSPC/IG SharePoint Portal Website to facilitate unit planning and
   scheduling activities. HQ AFSPC/IG will continue to conduct periodic no-/minimum-notice
   inspections as necessary.
       2.10.1.1. For all units, no-notice is defined as 72 hours or less; minimal-notice is less
       than 45 calendar days.
       2.10.1.2. Trusted Agents.         SAF/IGI, AFIA, AFSC/SEW, NGB-IG and
       MAJCOM/AFISRA/ OSI/AFDW Gatekeepers, and Functional inspection team
       scheduling POCs who participate in the AF Inspection Scheduling Process are the trusted
       agents for no/minimal-notice inspections.
       2.10.1.3. ARC units will participate in MAJCOM/IG no-notice and minimal-notice NSIs
       and NORIs. AFRC/CC may direct no-notice or minimal-notice AFRC inspections.
       MAJCOM/IGs must recognize there may be limited availability of ARC unit personnel in
       some functional areas when initiating no/minimal-notice inspections.
       2.10.1.4. See Chapter 7 for no/minimal-notice inspections for FOAs/DRUs.
       2.10.1.5. MAJCOM/IGs with OCONUS units will make every effort to minimize
       notification to units when inspecting outside regularly scheduled inspections based on the
       host nation and theater limitations.
   2.10.2. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/IG will formally notify Active Duty and integrated
   ARC units approximately 60-days prior to the start of the inspection. For integrated ARC
   units, the HQ AFSPC/IG will only inspect/observe those ARC personnel
   performing/scheduled for duty as an integrated member of active duty team. Non-integrated
   ARC units will receive 12 months notification.
   2.10.3. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/IG will provide a detailed requirements memorandum
   no later than 30-days prior to the inspection start date, which includes inspection team
   composition, final support requirements, etc.
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                          25


2.11. Selection for Performance-Based Evaluations. Inspection teams will randomly select
individuals/teams for executing performance-based evaluations in lieu of the inspected unit self-
identifying individuals/teams for evaluation (maintain team integrity as appropriate).
2.12. Inspecting Contracted Functions.
   2.12.1. Performance Work Statement (PWS). Assess and rate contracted functions against
   Performance Work Statements (PWS). Assess adequacy of PWS to meet mission
   requirements. Functional self-assessment checklists will be tailored to address differences
   between AF inspection requirements and PWS requirements. The Contracting Officer and/or
   Contracting Officer Representative (COR) will accompany the IG during inspections.
   Develop and implement safeguards to prevent contractor claims.
   2.12.2. Rating and Report. Contracted functions will be rated; however, individual
   contractors will not. Emphasis will be placed on the compliance of the function to be
   performed, not on the status of the personnel (military, civil service, or contractor)
   performing the function. Sampling of contracted activity will be coordinated through the
   Contracting Officer and/or Contracting Officer Representative (COR). Contractors may be
   provided with applicable portions of the report in-accordance-with (IAW) DOD Regulation
   5400.7/AFMAN 33-302, Freedom of Information Act Program.
   2.12.3. Validation. Validate observations related to contractor functions with the contracting
   officer. Deficiencies will be tracked IAW paragraph 2.16 Only the Contracting Officer can
   take formal action against the contractor for noncompliance or direct contractors to correct
   deficiencies identified during inspections.
   2.12.4. (Added-AFSPC) The HQ AFSPC/IG may inspect any service contract written or
   managed by an AFSPC contracting activity or funded by an AFSPC unit. Upon formal
   notification, units will provide:
       2.12.4.1. (Added-AFSPC) A list of contracts to include type and whether an award fee
       applies.
       2.12.4.2. (Added-AFSPC) A list of the names and telephone numbers of all Contracting
       Officers and CORs.
       2.12.4.3. (Added-AFSPC) A list of contractors exempt from participating in exercise
       events. Upon notification of a CUI Phase 1/2 or RI each organization will identify those
       contracts that do not include exercise activity participation. If a contract includes a
       Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) or Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) that
       allows for exercise participation, the wing should plan on that CDRL or CLIN being
       exercised during inspections. HQ AFSPC/IG will share those contracts that do not
       include exercise activity participation with all CUI inspection teams.
2.13. Additional Inspections.
   2.13.1. Management Inspection (MI). MIs evaluate organizations or programs above the
   wing level and will normally be accomplished by AFIA. MAJCOM/IGs may only conduct
   an MI if AFIA’s checklist, methodology and grading criteria are used (see Chapter 7). The
   MI will assess the efficiency, effectiveness, economy and discipline of organizations,
   processes and programs based on fundamental principles of well-managed organizations.
   The MI will use a five-tier rating system (OUTSTANDING, EXCELLENT,
26                                                AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013


  SATISFACTORY, MARGINAL and UNSATISFACTORY).                         Refer to Chapter 7 for
  specifics of the Management Inspection.
  2.13.2. Federal Recognition Inspection (FRI). The gaining MAJCOM will conduct a FRI
  of a state unit when the unit is being considered for federal recognition, or when asked to do
  so by the NGB-IG. Conduct the FRI according to AFI 90-201 ANGSUP, The Air Force
  Inspection System.
  2.13.3. Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT) Inspections. AFMC/IG will conduct
  BSAT compliance inspections for all units that are registered by the Centers for Disease
  Control and Prevention in accordance with governing directives (DODI 5210.89_AFI 10-
  3901, Minimum Security Standards for Safeguarding Biological Select Agents and Toxin.
  The inspection is designed to evaluate a unit's compliance with applicable policies for
  laboratory operations within Biological Safety Level III (BSL) facilities which store and use
  BSAT.
  2.13.4. Wounded, Ill, and Injured (WII) Facility Inspections. When applicable,
  MAJCOM/IGs will conduct WII Facility Inspections, as required by National Defense
  Authorization Act (NDAA) Fiscal Year (FY) 2008, House Record (H.R.) 4986, Section
  1662, Access of Recovering Service Members to Adequate Outpatient Residential Facilities.
  WII Facility Inspections may be conducted in conjunction with other inspections (NSI, RI,
  CI) but will be a separate, distinct inspection providing a separate inspection report. WII
  Facility Inspections will utilize a 3-tier rating scale: IN COMPLIANCE, IN COMPLIANCE
  WITH COMMENTS, or NOT IN COMPLIANCE. Refer to Attachment 8 for specific
  information pertaining to WII inspections.
  2.13.5. Functional Evaluations and Assessments. With few exceptions, HAF Functionals
  and/or FAMs should not conduct inspections (ref. paragraph 1.2.2). All inspection-type
  activity should be conducted by IGs, augmented by functional experts from HQ staffs and
  other units. Functional evaluations will be synchronized with IG inspections by the
  MAJCOM Gatekeeper. When requested by the MAJCOM/IG, Functionals should provide
  subject-matter experts (SMEs) as IG inspector augmentees. When absolutely necessary,
  MAJCOM/IGs may elect to use the results of command functional evaluations, assessments,
  and/or audits in lieu of additional IG inspections in those areas, provided the criteria used in
  those evaluations and functional inspector qualifications meet or exceed the requirements of
  this Instruction. When utilized, the MAJCOM/IG will publish the results of the functional
  evaluations and assessments in the appropriate section of the MAJCOM/IG inspection report
  for that unit.
  2.13.6. The Air Force Special Interest Item (SII) Program. SIIs provide a means to focus
  management attention and/or gather data to evaluate the status of specific programs and
  conditions in the field requiring AF senior leader attention. SIIs are used by HAF
  Functionals to make policy adjustments and enhance decision-making. There should be no
  more than five active SIIs at any given time.
     2.13.6.1. SAF/IGI manages the AF SII program by coordinating AF SII topic proposals
     and obtaining SAF/IG approval; distributing approved AF SII to MAJCOM/IGs;
     compiling and forwarding SII data to the sponsoring agency.
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                         27


     2.13.6.2. SAF/IGI will assess every potential SII for its impact on the nuclear enterprise
     and if necessary, coordinate with AF/A10 prior to publication.
     2.13.6.3. SII Sponsors. Only HAF Functionals may sponsor SIIs. Proposed SII topics
     may be initiated at any level but must be submitted by the appropriate HAF Functional to
     SAF/IGI at safigi.workflow@pentagon.af.mil. Submit SII topic proposals in the format
     provided on the SAF/IGI Air Force Enterprise Information Systems (AF EIS) Sharepoint
     website. Sponsors will coordinate with MAJCOM FAMs (to include, Guard/Reserve)
     prior to submitting a proposed AF SII.
     2.13.6.4. MAJCOM/IGs will receive SII notification from SAF/IGI. MAJCOM/IGs will
     notify all subordinate units/organizations (including gained ARC units) of the SII
     requirements as soon as possible following publication of the SII.
     2.13.6.5. MAJCOM/IGs will inspect all applicable active SIIs during formal inspections.
     Units need only be inspected and reported once during the SII’s active period. Gaining
     MAJCOM/IGs will coordinate with owning IGs prior to conducting SII inspections on
     gained units. Document the results of SII inspections as a separate section of the final
     inspection report.
     2.13.6.6. Inspectors will watch for trends and violations in any Air Force SII area,
     though individual functional areas take the lead.
     2.13.6.7. SII Reports. MAJCOM/IGs will document SII results in IGEMS. Units not
     receiving an IG inspection during the active period of the SII will conduct a one-time
     self-inspection on the SII topic using the self-inspection checklist and instructions
     accompanying the SII and forward results to their MAJCOM/IG.
         2.13.6.7.1. (Added-AFSPC) Report results to HQ AFSPC/IG e-mail workflow
         address.
     2.13.6.8. Rating. Normally, SIIs will not be rated/graded; the SII is for gathering data
     for analysis and action as necessary. If a rating is required as part of the SII, the scale
     will be specified in the SII instructions.
  2.13.7. MAJCOM Command Interest Items (CII). Ensure that MAJCOM CIIs do not
  conflict with AF SIIs.
  2.13.7. (AFSPC) Inspection Guidance. CIIs are designed to focus management attention,
  gather data and assess the status of specific programs and conditions in the field. HQ
  AFSPC/IG inspectors conduct CIIs using inspection guides and grading criteria provided by
  the CII sponsoring agency.
     2.13.7.1. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/IGI. Manages the HQ AFSPC CII program,
     coordinates HQ AFSPC CII topic proposals, and obtains HQ AFSPC/IG approval.
     Works with the functional Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) to ensure proposed
     CIIs are coordinated with ANG-IG prior to publication. Following approval, distributes
     to appropriate units, correlates returned data, prepares HQ AFSPC CII reports as
     required, and forwards these reports through HQ AFSPC/IG to the sponsoring agency.
     2.13.7.2. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC CII Sponsors. Only HQ AFSPC FAMs may
     sponsor CIIs. Identify potential HQ AFSPC-wide CII topics and submit topic proposals
     to HQ AFSPC/IG.

          CIIs are active for one year).
          2.13.7.5.4. (Added-AFSPC) Background and Rationale.               Provide sufficient
          background information to give inspectors an insight into the problem and include the
          rationale (i.e., the reason the CII is needed).
          2.13.7.5.5. (Added-AFSPC) CII Inspection Guides. Include a comprehensive
          inspection guide for units to apply in self inspections and MAJCOM/FOA/DRU IGs
          to inspect the CII topic. This guide should include specific questions and procedures
          for evaluating the topic. Ensure that compliance-oriented questions are solidly
          grounded in specific regulatory guidance (e.g., DoDI, AFI, etc.) and include the
          applicable reference with each question.
   2.13.8. (Added-AFSPC) Limited CI and RI. HQ AFSPC/IG conducts Limited Compliance
   Inspections (CIs) to assess areas mandated by law as well as mission areas that are critical or
   important to the health and performance of organizations. HQ AFSPC/IG conducts Limited
   Readiness Inspections (RIs) to evaluate and measure the ability of units to perform their
   conventional wartime, contingency or force sustainment missions. The Limited CI or RI
   may target:
      2.13.8.1. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/CC, HQ AFSPC/IG or HQ AFSPC functionals’
      areas of interest.

      are closed.
      2.14.1.6. All IG deficiencies, and only IG deficiencies, will be entered into IGEMs. IGs
      may enter deficiencies found by non-IG inspectors into IGEMS only after assessing and
      validating the deficiencies IAW AFI 90-201. IG Augmentees from Functional Areas
      may also enter data in functional data systems in addition to, not in lieu of, IGEMS.
      2.14.1.7. Post the final inspection report in IGEMS.
   2.14.2. For classified inspection reporting, use existing reporting methods on the Secret
   Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet). IG teams will fully utilize IGEMS-C within
   six months of IGEMS-C certification and availability for classified inspection reporting.
   2.14.3. Access management. Access to IGEMS will be administered by AFIA, SAF/IGI and
   MAJCOM/IG Administrators.
2.15. Inspection Reports.
   2.15.1. Classification. Review all reports prior to publication to ensure they are properly
   classified and marked IAW DOD 5200.1-R, Procedures Governing the Activities of DOD
   Intelligence Components that Affect United States Persons and AFI 31-401.

   2.15.3. Releasability. TIG is the confidential agent of SECAF and CSAF for obtaining
   uninhibited self-analysis and self-criticism of the internal management, operation, and
   administration of the Air Force. Therefore, Air Force IG reports are internal memoranda and
   constitute privileged information that is not releasable outside the AF except with specific
   approval of TIG. All requests for IG reports, or extracts therefrom, originating from sources
   outside the original distribution, shall be referred to SAF/IGI for coordination and clearance.
   Classifications and restrictions on the disclosure or use of IG reports shall be strictly
   observed.
      2.15.3.1. Release Determination Authority. Before releasing inspection reports outside
      DOD, FOIA offices will receive a final release determination from SAF/IGI. Non-DOD
      parties requesting inspection reports should be referred to the appropriate FOIA office.
      2.15.3.2. Release within DOD. DOD members, DOD contractors, consultants, and
      grantees are permitted access to inspection reports IAW DOD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-
      302. MAJCOM/IGs are authorized to release inspection reports, in whole or in part,

       request access to review HQ AFSPC inspection reports through the HQ AFSPC/IG
       SharePoint Portal.
       2.15.3.3. Release of Inspection Summary to News Media. An inspection summary may
       be released for internal information or in response to news media queries in coordination
       with public affairs. The summary will be limited to the overall rating, inspection
       process/definition and, if desired, personal comments by the commander (e.g. general
       laudatory comments, perception of inspection process). The published summary will not
       contain detailed information (e.g. sub-area ratings, a list of individuals recognized by the
       IG, specific deficiencies, or specific ratings for inspection criteria). The use of HAF and
       MAJCOM Public Affairs Guidance (PAG) are encouraged.
       2.15.3.4. Releasability Statement. The following statement must appear on the cover and
       each page of the report as well as in any transmission, presentation, or document

       from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Do not release or publish, in
       whole or in part, outside official DOD channels without express approval of the Director,
       SAF/IGI.‖ Include similar statements on reports of inspections conducted jointly with
       inspection teams from other DOD agencies.
   2.15.4. NLT 5 work days after the IG team outbriefs the inspected unit, the MAJCOM/IG
   will send an executive summary of the inspection, IAW Figure A4.2 to the inspected unit
   CC and SAF/IGI, unless the final inspection report has already been published and
   distributed.
   2.15.5. NLT 30 days after the IG team departs the inspected unit, the MAJCOM/IG will send
   the final IG inspection report and notify organizations the final IG inspection report is
   available in IGEMS.
   2.15.5. (AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/IG will post an electronic copy of the final inspection report
   on the HQ AFSPC/IG SharePoint Portal/CoP site after all the unit’s rebuttals have been
   addressed and adjudicated. Instructions for accessing electronic reports and trend data are on
   the SharePoint Portal/CoP site.
   2.15.6. (Added-AFSPC) ANG Logistics Compliance Assessment Program (LCAP) team
   will provide HQ AFSPC/IGIP a copy of the inspection report from HQ AFSPC-ANG gained
   units within 2 weeks of final approval.
   2.15.7. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/IG inspection reports will include ARC units whose
   personnel were inspected during a Compliance and/or Readiness Inspection of an HQ
   AFSPC Active Duty unit.
2.16. Inspection Deficiencies.
   2.16.1. All inspection reports will address non-primary inspection activity deficiencies,
   including safety, surety, or issues of military discipline. These concerns may directly affect
   an overall inspection rating at the discretion of the inspection team chief and will be
   documented in the final inspection report. Inspection reports will include only findings
   categorized as Strengths, Deficiencies or Recommended Improvement Areas (RIA). RIAs
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                         31


  will not be used to document procedural deviations or non-compliance; they are only used to
  identify areas where a more efficient or effective course of action is available.
  2.16.2. Safety. Safety is an integral part of every inspection. Inspectors will assess safety
  procedures and workplace hazards during all inspections, notify the appropriate commander
  and safety office of concerns, and document in the report if required.
  2.16.3. Surety. Nuclear surety, at nuclear capable units, is always subject to inspection
  during any IG inspection. A potential nuclear surety deficiency will be brought to the
  immediate attention of the inspection team chief. The team chief will determine the
  appropriate course of action and determine the impact (if any) on the inspection rating.
  2.16.4. Validation. MAJCOM/IGs will establish a validation process that provides the
  inspected unit the opportunity to clarify and/or rebut in a timely manner any potential
  deficiencies identified during the inspection. MAJCOM/IG Team Chief, in coordination
  with the wing or unit under inspection, will coordinate with the appropriate
  MAJCOM/NGB/FOA/DRU FAMs on all critical and significant deficiencies identified
  during the inspection. This process applies to deficiencies levied against other MAJCOM
  units or HHQ organizations.
  2.16.4. (AFSPC) NGB Staff will assist HQ AFSPC/IG with the validation of unit
  deficiencies upon request by the MAJCOM/IG.
     2.16.4.1. Inspectors will validate potential deficiencies at the lowest possible level, but
     no higher than the appropriate FAM at the respective MAJCOM/NGB/FOA/DRU or
     organizations with whom the IG team has a memorandum of agreement.
     MAJCOM/NGB/FOA/DRU FAMs will consult with the appropriate HAF Functional as
     required to ensure proper interpretation of Air Force (or higher) policy.
     2.16.4.2. MAJCOM FAMs or other SMEs will clarify policy and procedures, or validate
     that a potential deficiency does/does not comply with policy, and will not provide
     input/comment on the severity of a validated deficiency; that responsibility resides with
     the MAJCOM/IG. All deficiencies coded CRITICAL or SEVERE that cite "safety"
     should be validated by a qualified safety professional (mil: 1SOXX, 2WXX, 21MX, Civ:
     0018, or MAJCOM FAM-designated SME).
     2.16.4.3. Oversight Deficiencies. MAJCOM/IGs are not required to validate deficiencies
     beyond the appropriate MAJCOM FAMs or agencies with whom the IG has MOA/MOU
     for validation support. If the oversight team independently validates with the HAF
     Functional and receives contradictory information, a deficiency may be levied against the
     MAJCOM and/or HAF Functional.
     2.16.4.4. All validated deficiencies will be documented in the report.
     2.16.4.5. (Added-AFSPC) During an inspection, HQ AFSPC Functionals will not
     provide guidance or policy interpretations to units under inspection without prior HQ
     AFSPC/IG coordination. Additionally, unit personnel will not contact MAJCOM
     Directorates or Higher Headquarters for policy interpretations related to the inspection
     without prior HQ AFSPC/IG coordination.
     2.16.4.6. (Added-AFSPC) As part of the validation process, the HQ AFSPC/IG will
     brief potential deficiencies to unit commanders by providing daily inspection summaries.
32                                               AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013


     Unit commanders may submit a formal rebuttal using the HQ AFSPC/IG rebuttal process
     (see Attachment 14).
  2.16.5. Deficiency Cause Codes. Corrective action OPRs will assign Deficiency Cause
  Codes to all deficiencies in IGEMS IAW Attachment 7.
  2.16.6. Deficiencies External to the Inspected Unit. When a MAJCOM/IG team is
  considering assigning a deficiency to an organization outside their MAJCOM, the inspecting
  IG team chief will notify the owning MAJCOM/IG of the potential deficiency and validation
  details (or AFIA for DRU/FOAs, HAF or non-AF deficiencies) and courtesy copy both the
  tenant and host base units NLT 5 days after completion of the inspection. If possible,
  validate each deficiency with the potential Corrective Action OPR and gain concurrence that
  the OPR will accept the deficiency; however, Corrective Action OPR concurrence with
  deficiency assignment or wording is not required. Once validated, the owning MAJCOM/IG
  (or AFIA) will be responsible for tracking status and notifying the inspecting MAJCOM/IG
  when closed (See paragraph 4.13. for reporting, tracking, and closure reporting of DTRA-
  identified NSI deficiencies). In instances where the inspection involves associate units,
  coordination between the associated and associating MAJCOM/IGs on how deficiencies are
  assigned, assessed, and resolved will be essential to ensuring timely resolution.
  2.16.7. Deficiency write-ups will:
     2.16.7.1. Be assigned a unique tracking number.
     2.16.7.2. Describe, in sufficient detail, the deficiency and contextual facts as necessary to
     clearly convey the defect requiring resolution. The written description alone should be
     adequate for the inspected party to begin corrective action planning.
     2.16.7.3. Be assigned a deficiency severity of CRITICAL, SIGNIFICANT, or MINOR.
     2.16.7.4. Reference the applicable instruction, technical order or other source
     documentation.
     2.16.7.5. Address impact of continued deviation or non-compliance for critical
     deficiencies.
     2.16.7.6. Identify MAJCOM FAM OPRs for CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT
     deficiencies (MAJCOM functional office responsible for coordinating on unit’s
     corrective action plan).
     2.16.7.6. (AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/IG will assign NGB-IGD to the Functional Area
     IGEMS POC line for deficiencies levied against ANG units or the NGB staff. NGB-IGD
     will assign NGB Functional Area POCs. NGB Functional Area POCs may be
     Directorate Primary and/or Alternate IGEMs POC or any member of the NGB Staff as
     appropriate.
     2.16.7.7. Identify the Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR), if applicable.
     2.16.7.8. Deficiencies that involve hosts/tenants outside the inspected unit’s chain-of-
     command, HHQ, other MAJCOMs, DRU/FOA, HAF or non-AF entities will be
     categorized as HHQ/Support Agency Deficiencies.
  2.16.8. Deficiency Corrective Actions.
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                        33


     2.16.8.1. At a minimum, the MAJCOM/IG will track all CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT
     deficiencies and provide the inspected unit with MAJCOM-unique reply instructions as
     part of the final report. Associated corrective action plans will be provided to
     MAJCOM/IGs NLT 45 days and for ARC units NLT 90 days after the final inspection
     report is published. CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT deficiencies require a description of
     the unit’s corrective action to include root cause(s), Cause Code(s) assigned from
     Attachment 7, and countermeasures initiated to mitigate risk and/or preclude deficiency
     recurrence. Minor deficiencies assessed to the inspected unit will be closed at the wing
     level. Minor deficiencies assessed to the MAJCOM-level will be closed by the
     MAJCOM/IG.
        2.16.8.1.1. MAJCOM/NGB/FOA/DRU FAMs will coordinate and approve
        corrective action plans, on behalf of the MAJCOM/CC, for all CRITICAL and
        SIGNIFICANT deficiencies.        Once the corrective action plan is in place,
        MAJCOM/IGs, after review and coordination with the responsible MAJCOM/NGB
        FAM(s), may close the identified deficiencies.
        2.16.8.1.1. (AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/IG is approval authority for closure of ANG unit
        deficiencies.
            2.16.8.1.1.1. (Added-AFSPC) NGB will use IGEMS to coordinate and approve
            corrective action plans for ANG Wings, Groups and Squadrons according to HQ
            AFSPC/IG IGEMS procedures.
            2.16.8.1.1.2. (Added-AFSPC) Corrective Action Plan Process. ANG units will
            use HQ AFSPC/IG CAP process and timelines.
        2.16.8.1.2. All deficiencies not requiring a long-term solution (as determined by the
        MAJCOM/IG) should be closed within 12 months (18 months for ARC).
        2.16.8.1.3. In instances where corrective action responsibility is assigned to both the
        host and tenant unit (or supported and supporting unit), MAJCOM/IGs will assign an
        OPR and an OCR to correct the identified deficiencies.
        2.16.8.1.4. Deficiencies that contain potential Fraud, Waste or Abuse will be
        highlighted in inspection reports and forwarded to the MAJCOM/IG for semi-annual
        reporting.
     2.16.8.2. MAJCOM/IGs will forward MAJCOM-closed root cause(s), Cause Code(s),
     countermeasures, to include OPR(s) and ECD(s), and deficiency closure dates for all
     nuclear-related CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT deficiencies to the AFIA Process
     Integration Directorate (AFIA/PI). For open deficiencies, the corrective action OPR will
     report status to the MAJCOM IG quarterly until closed.
     2.16.8.3. MAJCOM/IGs will forward all HAF-level (FOA/DRU, HAF, and non-AF)
     actionable deficiencies and validation details to AFIA for deficiency processing.
     Validation details include MAJCOM, FOA/DRU, HAF, and non-AF Functional(s) who
     participated in the deficiency validation and contact info. AFIA will forward the
     deficiency and problem solving/corrective action requirements to the responsible HAF-
     level office (O-6/GS equivalent or above) for action or comment and copy the
     MAJCOM/IG.         The corrective action OPR will determine root cause(s) and
34                                                AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013


     countermeasure(s), to include OPR(s) and ECD(s), and assign Cause Code(s) from AFI
     90-201, Attachment 7. AFIA will provide corrective action OPR an electronic template
     to document the required problem solving/corrective action data. Corrective action OPRs
     will include measures or procedures initiated to mitigate risk and/or preclude deficiency
     recurrence and enough detail for the MAJCOM/IG to evaluate whether to close the
     deficiency or keep it open. If corrective action is not complete, the corrective action OPR
     will describe progress and provide updates, as required. The corrective action response,
     i.e., completed template and, if needed, additional documentation, will be returned
     electronically to the MAJCOM/IG and AFIA. After review, the MAJCOM/IG will
     forward a deficiency closure recommendation to AFIA. AFIA will close the deficiency,
     maintain corrective action documentation, and conduct follow-up on open deficiencies.
     2.16.8.4. Commanders of inspected units will ensure that unit OPRs enter deficiency
     resolution data (e.g., root cause analysis results and corrective action plan status
     information) into the IGEMS database in a timely manner.
  2.16.9. Root Cause Analysis. Problem-solving responsibility and the corrective action
  process reside at the lowest appropriate command level. Commanders will ensure root cause
  analysis is completed for all deficiencies using the problem-solving approach/tool and level
  of effort best suited to the situation. Commanders should strongly consider using the rigor of
  the AF 8-Step Problem Solving Model as outlined in the AF Smart Operations for the 21 st
  Century (AFSO21) playbook for CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT deficiencies to determine
  primary and, if applicable, contributing root causes.
  2.16.10. Deficiency Fix Rate (DFR). MAJCOM/IGs and AFIA will monitor DFR for all
  identified CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT deficiencies. DFR is a key measure of
  performance to show the average number of days required to close a deficiency. The DFR
  clock starts on the date of the inspection outbrief. The DFR clock stops when the deficiency
  is closed. For a long-term deficiency (one in which the fix runs through the Future Years
  Defense Plan), once the proper mitigation is in place to effectively manage the deficiency
  risk, deficiency closure may be appropriate. DFR will be incorporated into future IGEMS
  capability.
  2.16.11. MAJCOM/IGs will also provide Cause Codes assigned by the corrective action
  OPR(s) for all nuclear-related MINOR deficiencies via the template. An electronic copy of
  this template can be requested from AFIA/PI workflow at afia.pi@kirtland.af.mil. An
  updated template will be sent to AFIA/PI when all unit level deficiencies are closed. If all
  deficiencies are not closed within 90 days after a published final inspection report, the
  corrective action OPR will report status of all deficiencies to the MAJCOM/IG quarterly
  until complete.
  2.16.12. The Deficiency Cause Codes listed in Attachment 7 apply to all inspections listed
  in this AFI except DNSIs, which have unique codes assigned by DOD (see Chapter 4 for
  nuclear-specific inspection guidance). Assign all Deficiency Cause Codes required to
  describe the deficiency. Commonly, more than one Deficiency Cause Code will be
  applicable. NOTE: If the code ―OT‖ (Other) is used, a full description must be included.
  2.16.13. Write-ups from previous inspections should be reviewed prior to an inspection. At
  the conclusion of the inspection, repeat deficiencies should be considered in the unit’s overall
  rating. Identify the repeat deficiency by stating: ―REPEAT DEFICIENCY,‖ followed by the
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                          35


   updated deficiency write-up. Repeat deficiencies are deficiencies that have been previously
   identified, corrected, and closed, and have recurred following closure.
2.17. Inspection Outbrief. A mass outbrief conducted by the IG following a CUI Phase 0, 1 or
2 or other large-scale unit inspection is mandatory. Commanders should provide a suitable
location to ensure maximum attendance within resource capability.
   2.17.1. Unit outbriefs are considered a version of the inspection report and consequently fall
   within releasability restrictions. DOD members, contractors, consultants, and grantees are
   permitted to attend inspection outbriefs at the discretion of the unit commander. Community
   leaders and the general public are not authorized access to inspection results, to include
   outbriefs, except as permitted by DOD Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supplement (see
   paragraph 2.15.3.)
   2.17.2. (Added-AFSPC) After the unit out-brief, the NAF/Center/Wing Commander will
   conduct an inspection out-brief to the AFSPC/CC when the following criteria are met: a
   critical deficiency is identified, a major graded area is rated ―UNSATISFACTORY‖, a
   significant trend highlights systemic or programmatic wing-wide deficiencies. The HQ
   AFSPC/IG will recommend any other inspection out-brief topics to HQ AFSPC/CV (after
   consultation with HQ functional, NAF/CC and Wing/CC). If this criteria has not been met,
   the inspection will close out without an out-brief. When the inspection is closed-out without
   an out-brief, the unit commander may send a short e-mail to the HQ AFSPC/CC outlining
   inspection perspectives.
   2.17.3. (Added-AFSPC) For Active Duty and ARC squadron and group level inspections,
   commanders will brief the next highest level of command their root cause analysis
   results(reference paragraph 2.16.9).
2.18. The Air Force Inspection System Governance Process.
   2.18.1. The governance process is executed by three groups shown in Figure 2.1. Charters
   for each of the groups will contain detailed duties and functions.
 36                                               AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013


Figure 2.1. AF Inspection System Governance Process.




      2.18.1.1. Inspection System Working Group (ISWG). The ISWG will meet quarterly to
      discuss the adequacy of the AFIS and proposals for improving the AFIS. The ISWG will
      be chaired by SAF/IGI with membership from key HAF 2-letter O-6/Civilian Equivalent
      representatives (AF/A1, AF/A2, AF/A3/5, AF/A4/7, SAF/CIO A6, AF/A8, AF/A9,
      AF/A10, AF/SG, AF/JA, SAF/AA, SAF/IE, AF/SE, NGB/IG, SAF/FM) and
      MAJCOM/IGs. The ISWG will vet proposals and track action items for consideration by
      the Inspector General Advisory Board (IGAB) and/or the Inspection System Council
      (ISC).
      2.18.1.2. Inspector General Advisory Board (IGAB). The IGAB will meet semi-
      annually to discuss issues forwarded by the ISWG and any other inspection related
      business deemed appropriate for this forum. SAF/IG will chair the IGAB, comprised of
      key 2-letter Functionals, or their Deputies. SAF/IGI will act as the Executive Secretary
      for the IGAB.
      2.18.1.3. Inspection System Council (ISC). The ISC will meet semi-annually in
      conjunction with existing MAJCOM/CV meetings to discuss any inspection related
      business and to approve/disapprove suggestions for improving the AFIS submitted by the
      ISWG or IGAB. SAF/IG will chair the ISC, comprised of MAJCOM/CVs and selected
      FOA/DRU CCs. SAF/IGI will be the Executive Secretary for the ISC.
   2.18.2. Process to Change List of Authorized Inspections (Attachment 2) or Inspection
   Requirements (Attachment 3). AF agencies should submit requests to change, add or
   subtract an inspection activity listed in Attachment 2, or an inspection requirement listed in
   Attachment 3, to the appropriate HAF 2-letter for coordination. AF/JA will determine all
   JA Functional inspection requirements. HAF 2-letters may submit the recommendation to
   SAF/IGI at safigi.workflow@pentagon.af.mil for vetting through the AFIS Governance
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                     37


   Process. The request should include a 1-page justification, OPR and phone number for
   further clarification.
      2.18.2.1. Non-AF agencies should contact SAF/IGI with a request to change/add/subtract
      an inspection activity in Attachment 2. SAF/IGI will gain TIG’s approval and notify
      IGAB and ISC members at the next meeting.
   2.18.3. TIG-approved changes. TIG may modify the AFIS to meet SECAF/CSAF intent.
   Decisions reached during an IG conference or IG-led Process Review Group (to include the
   NSI PRG) will be incorporated into AFI 90-201 with SAF/IG approval.
      2.18.3.1. Approved changes to the AFIS will be published via Guidance Memorandum,
      Interim Change, or complete revision of this publication.
   2.18.4. AFIS Suggestion Program. Any Airman may submit an idea for improving the AF
   Inspection System to SAF/IGI at safigi.workflow@pentagon.af.mil with the words ―AFIS
   Improvement‖ in the subject line.
2.19. Future State of the AFIS:
   2.19.1. At a date to be determined, certified IG inspectors will be required to carry
   appropriate credentials.

                                         Chapter 3

                      CONSOLIDATED UNIT INSPECTION (CUI)

3.1. General Information. A CUI is completed when the requirements for a Phase 0, 1 & 2 are
completed. MAJCOM/IGs may tailor the composition and synchronization of CUI elements to
optimize inspection effectiveness and efficiency IAW the intent of this Instruction.
   3.1.1. Phase 0. Phase 0 is an inspection scheduling construct that enables synchronized
   compliance-focused inspections in approximately one week at each unit. During a Phase 0,
   MAJCOM IGs should complete a Compliance Inspection (CI) and AFIA should accomplish
   a Health Services Inspection (HSI). The A4’s Logistics Compliance Assessment Program
   (LCAP) and the JA’s Article 6 inspection should be synchronized to occur during a Phase 0.
   Gatekeepers should offer the opportunity for DISA’s Command Cyber Readiness Inspection
   (CCRI) and DTRA’s Balanced Survivability Assessment (BSA) to be completed as required
   at the inspected unit. MAJCOM/IGs may conduct other IG inspections and compliance-
   focused Functional inspections during Phase 0. Only those synchronized inspections whose
   data will be validated by the IG and entered into IGEMS will be included in the IG’s final
   report. See Figure 3.1.

Figure 3.1. Intended CUI Structure.
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                          39


   3.1.2. Phase 1 & 2. Phase 1 & 2 is a scheduling construct that enables synchronized
   readiness-focused inspections in approximately one week at each unit. During Phase 1 & 2,
   MAJCOM IGs should complete a Readiness Inspection (RI). MAJCOM/IGs may conduct
   other IG inspections and synchronized Functional inspections during Phase 1 & 2 as
   required. Only those synchronized inspections whose data will be validated by the IG and
   entered into IGEMS will be included in the IG’s final report.
   3.1.3. CUI Re-inspection. Units receiving an overall rating of UNSATISFACTORY during
   a CUI Phase 0, 1 or 2 will be scheduled for a re-inspection within 6 months. MAJCOM/CC
   approval is required to exceed the 6-month re-inspection interval. MAJCOM/IG will
   determine whether to reaccomplish the entire inspection or to limit the re-inspection to only
   those MGAs rated MARGINAL or UNSATISFACTORY.
   3.1.3. (AFSPC) Re-Inspection criterion applies to compliance and readiness inspections.
   HQ AFSPC/IG will schedule all ARC units receiving an overall ―UNSATISFACTORY‖
   compliance and/or readiness rating for a re-inspection within 6 months. If ARC leadership
   believes there are issues that potentially impact the established re-inspection date, they may
   submit a waiver request to the HQ AFSPC/IG.
3.2. CUI Scheduling Considerations.
   3.2.1. Extension-Induced Constraints. MAJCOM/CC extension of CUI Phase 0 frequency to
   48/60 months IAW paragraph 2.6 may cause the MAJCOM/IG to conduct a Tailored CI.
   For Active Duty and Classic-Associate units, a Tailored CI is required if a CI is not
   completed at least every 30 months. For unit-equipped ARC, Active-Associate and ARC-
   Associate TFI units, a Tailored CI is required if a CI is not completed at least every 36
   months. Tailored CIs are not applicable to ANG units. The Tailored CI should include an
   HSI and a sample of requirements from NWRM, Weather Operations (formerly
   Standardization and Evaluation Program for Weather Operations (SEPWO)), Airfield
   Operations Certification Inspection (AOCI) (formerly Air Traffic System Evaluation
   Program (ATSEP)), Environmental, Safety, Occupational Health Compliance Assessment
   Management Program (ESOHCAMP), and AF Metrology and Calibration (AFMETCAL)
   areas listed in Attachment 3. MAJCOM IGs may synchronize a Tailored CI with other
   inspections. Figure 3.2 shows one example of a Tailored CI being synchronized with a
   Readiness Inspection.
   3.2.2. Synchronization Constraints. MAJCOM/IGs should attempt to complete all elements
   of CUI Phase 0, 1 & 2 in approximately 2 weeks every 2 years (48 months for ARC).
   However, based on resource constraints (e.g., high-demand/low-density inspection team
   availability, airlift, billeting, vehicles, workcenter size), MAJCOM/IGs may schedule
   portions of CUI elements before/after the primary inspection week.
   3.2.3. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC CUI Scheduling Considerations. The following
   guidelines provide the framework for scheduling HQ AFSPC unit inspections. The HQ
   AFSPC/IG will:
      3.2.3.1. (Added-AFSPC) Schedule CUIs for HQ AFSPC NAFs, Wings and Centers.
      Normally, all other HQ AFSPC units will only be scheduled for a Readiness and/or
      Compliance Inspection.
40                                            AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013


     3.2.3.2. (Added-AFSPC) Inspect NAFs, Wings and units with operational missions as
     well as the 61st Air Base Group (61 ABG) every 24 months (alternating CUI Phase 0
     and1/2). Inspections may include a Limited Compliance or Readiness Inspection off-set
     from the primary CUI (e.g. conduct a Limited Compliance Inspection with a CUI Phase
     1/2).
     3.2.3.3. (Added-AFSPC) Inspect non-operational units (i.e., Space and Missile Systems
     Center (SMC), Air Force Spectrum Management Office (AFSMO) and Air Force
     Network Integration Center (AFNIC)) every 24 months (CUI Phase 0).
     3.2.3.4. (Added-AFSPC) SMC personnel will participate in the 61 ABG CUI Phase 1/2
     as inspection requirements dictate (e.g., Emergency Management Exercises, deployment
     processing).
     3.2.3.5. (Added-AFSPC) Inspect integrated ARC units during the primary wing
     inspection.
     3.2.3.6. (Added-AFSPC) Inspect Air National Guard units every 48 months (combined
     Readiness and Compliance Inspections).
     3.2.3.7. (Added-AFSPC) Inspect Air Reserve units every 48 months through an HQ
     AFSPC-led Readiness Inspection combined with an AFRC-led Compliance Inspection.
     3.2.3.8. (Added-AFSPC) Conduct a CUI Phase 0 or compliance inspection for all
     newly assigned units after a 12 month transition period into the command.
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                         41


Figure 3.2. CUI with Tailored CI made necessary by CUI Frequency Extension.




3.3. Compliance Inspection (CI). CIs are conducted to assess areas mandated by law as well
as mission areas that are critical or important to the health and performance of organizations.
Unit failure to comply with the established directives in these areas could result in legal
liabilities, penalties, or mission impact.
   3.3.1. CI Sampling. During a CI, MAJCOM/IGs will inspect all applicable mandatory AF
   inspection requirements (indicated in Attachment 3 by a thick, dark vertical line in the
   column labeled, ―MANDATORY‖), HAF SIIs, MAJCOM/CC interest items, by-law
   requirements and a sample of the inspection requirements in each applicable MGA (indicated

       mission requirements. Procedures and activities are carried out in an effective and
       competent manner. Resources and programs are efficiently managed. Minor deficiencies
       may exist but do not impede or limit mission accomplishment.
       3.3.2.4. MARGINAL—The rating given to indicate performance or operation does not
       meet some mission requirements. Procedures and activities are not carried out in an
       efficient manner. Resources and programs are not efficiently managed. Deficiencies
       exist that impede or limit mission accomplishment.
       3.3.2.5. UNSATISFACTORY—The rating given to indicate performance or operation
       does not meet mission requirements. Procedures and activities are not carried out in an
       adequate manner. Resources and programs are not adequately managed. Significant
       deficiencies exist that preclude or seriously limit mission accomplishment.
   3.3.3. Major Graded Areas (MGAs) and Sub-areas. MGAs represent key processes,
   procedures, and requirements based on public law, executive orders, DOD, AF, MAJCOM,
   and ARC directives and instructions. MAJCOMs may supplement the requirements of AF
   MGAs and add MAJCOM-specific MGAs. MGAs are organized according to Functional
   policy origin and are identified in Attachment 3 in light blue color. Sub-areas of each MGA
   are identified in gray color.
   3.3.4. Inspection of Nuclear Weapon Related Materiel (NWRM). MAJCOM/IGs will
   coordinate with MAJCOM/NGB FAMs to determine units to be inspected based on the
   official Air Force list of NWRM National Stock Numbers. NWRM requirements are now
   located under the Logistics (A4/7) inspection requirements in Attachment 3. NWRM
   inspection requirements will be accomplished as an MGA during a Phase 0 CI and a Phase
   1&2 Tailored CI.
   3.3.5. ANG conducts safety program assessments during NGB ESOHCAMPs. NGB will
   synchronize the scheduling of ESOHCAMPs with CUI Phase 0 CI to the maximum extent
   possible. MAJCOM/IG inspections of the Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health
   functional areas will not duplicate NGB ESOHCAMP inspection elements. MAJCOM/IG
   should arrange to receive a copy of the NGB ESOHCAMP report. MAJCOM/IG may
   review the status of discrepancies noted in NGB ESOHCAMP reports.
3.4. Readiness Inspection (RI). RIs evaluate and measure the ability of units to perform their
conventional wartime, contingency or force sustainment missions IAW the Defense Readiness
Reporting System (DRRS) Mission Essential Task List (METL), or unit's DOC statement and
Status of Resources & Training System (SORTS) report. For maximum effectiveness in
assessing operational readiness, all readiness MGAs should be assessed during the same visit.
However, if required to divide the inspection into separate visits, the inspection will consist of
two phases.
   3.4.1. RI Phase 1. Evaluates the unit’s transition from peacetime readiness to a wartime
   posture and their ability to maintain and sustain essential home station missions during this

   transition. The MGA of Positioning the Force will primarily be assessed during this phase of
   the inspection.
   3.4.2. RI Phase 2. Evaluates the unit’s ability to meet wartime/contingency taskings
   primarily through the MGAs of Employing the Force and Sustaining the Force. The MGA of
   Ability to Survive and Operate (ATSO) is dynamic and will be applied during conduct of all
   the other MGAs.
   3.4.3. Performance. IG teams will focus on mission performance during Phase 1&2 RIs.
   Academic testing will not be used as a primary measure of readiness unless it serves a
   specific inspection objective or hands-on performance cannot be observed.
   3.4.4. RI Rating. The overall inspection, readiness MGAs and sub-areas will be rated using
   a five-tier scale, as described in paragraphs 3.3.2.1 — 3.3.2.5
3.5. Major Graded Areas (MGAs) and Sub-areas. Units with a wartime or contingency
mission will be rated in four MGAs: 1. Positioning the Force, 2. Employing the Force, 3.

                                           Chapter 4

                   AIR FORCE NUCLEAR INSPECTION PROGRAMS

4.1. Nuclear Weapons Technical Inspections (NWTI). Nuclear weapon systems require
special consideration because of their political and military importance, their destructive power,
and the potential consequences of an accident or unauthorized act. NWTIs are performance and
compliance-based inspections and are conducted to evaluate a unit's ability to manage nuclear
resources while complying with all nuclear surety standards (reference DoD 3150.2-M, DoD
Nuclear Weapons System Safety Program Manual). CJCSI 3263.05 is the governing Instruction
for the conduct of NWTIs. In instances where CJCSI 3263.05 specifies responsibilities for
―Service,‖ MAJCOMs fill that role. The NSI is the AF inspection used to satisfy requirements of
an NWTI. AF inspection teams will conduct NSIs in accordance with CJCSI 3263.05 and
reference this AFI for additional AF-specific inspection requirements. If there is conflict
between CJCSI 3263.05 and this Instruction, CJCSI 3263.05 takes precedence. See paragraph
3.3.4. and Attachment 3 for NWRM inspection guidance.
4.2. Nuclear Surety Inspector Eligibility, Training and Certification. In addition to the
requirements of Chapter 8, to fulfill inspection oversight data collection, MAJCOM/IGs will
provide training and certification status, IG experience level and number of NSIs to AFIA for
tracking and trending.
4.3. Nuclear-Capable Unit Operational Certification and Operational Restriction. Refer to
AFI 63-125, Nuclear Certification Program and AF/A10 guidance.
4.4. Initial Nuclear Surety Inspection (INSI). The INSI is the culminating step both in the
Operational Certification Process for certifying a unit as nuclear-capable as well certifying new
equipment and/or systems requiring nuclear certification. The Lead/using MAJCOM, in
coordination with HQ AFSC/SEW, will determine the need for conducting INSI based upon AFI
63-125 requirements and any HQ/A10 supplemental guidance. Applicable Functional(s) will
develop READY/NOT READY inspection criteria to be used by the MAJCOM/IG during the
INSI. In order to meet Oversight and Core Team responsibilities, MAJCOM/IGs will notify the
AFIA/TI at least 60 calendar days prior to inspection execution (refer to paragraphs 4.14.2 and
7.3.). MAJCOM/IGs will notify Nuclear Enterprise agencies of the inspection commencement
and conclusion using Attachment 4.
   4.4.1. For units not previously nuclear-certified, conduct an INSI prior to employing,
   storing, assembling, maintaining or transporting War Reserve (WR). Conduct an NSI within
   180-calendar days of the unit receiving an INSI READY rating. Unless waived by the
   MAJCOM/CC, the READY rating expires 180-calendar days after the unit receives the
   READY rating.
   4.4.2. For currently certified nuclear-capable units programmed to receive a new weapon
   system/delivery system, conduct an INSI of operations and maintenance supporting the new
   system prior to receipt. Conduct an NSI within 180-calendar days of the unit receiving an
   INSI READY rating. Unless waived by the MAJCOM/CC, the READY rating expires 180-
   calendar days after the unit receives the READY rating.
   4.4.3. For decertified nuclear-capable units, conduct an INSI prior to resuming those
   operations (employing, storing, assembling, maintaining or transporting WR) for which the
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                            55


   unit has been decertified to accomplish, as specified by the MAJCOM/CC in the
   decertification directive. Once an INSI has been successfully accomplished and the nuclear-
   certified status reinstated, conduct an NSI within 180-calendar days of the unit receiving the
   INSI READY rating. Unless waived by the MAJCOM/CC, the READY rating expires 180-
   calendar days after the unit receives the READY rating.
   4.4.4. A READY rating for an EOD team or nuclear airlift unit establishes the NWTI cycle
   for that unit IAW DoD 3150.2M. A READY INSI rating and certification for new and/or
   modified facilities, equipment and/or systems do not alter or reset the unit's existing NWTI
   cycle unless the INSI is accomplished in conjunction with a full-scale NSI.
   4.4.5. INSIs may be conducted in phases. If phased INSIs are conducted, the responsible
   MAJCOM will prepare an inspection plan identifying all required areas to be inspected by
   phase and forward the plan to HQ AFSC/SEW for review and approval. A READY rating
   must be achieved and maintained for the phase of the INSI under evaluation before
   evaluating the next phase. All phases must be rated READY prior to assuming nuclear
   operations. Unless waived by the MAJCOM/CC, a Phased READY rating expires 180-
   calendar days from issuance. Conduct a NSI, on all portions of the unit’s nuclear mission, to
   include the addition of all phases, within 180-calendar days of final INSI completion.
4.5. Nuclear Surety Inspection (NSI). Assesses a unit's ability to accomplish its assigned
nuclear weapons mission and produce reliable nuclear weapons in a safe and secure environment
in compliance with applicable directives. Additionally, an NSI inspects a unit’s capability to
safely and reliably receive, store, secure, assemble, transport, maintain, load, mate, lock/unlock,
test, render safe and employ nuclear weapons. Missile launch crews, aircrews, command post
controllers and release teams must demonstrate (through performance-based assessments,
testing, etc.) their knowledge of weapon acceptance procedures, nuclear weapon system safety
rules, and nuclear weapon control order handling and authentication procedures. In order to
meet Oversight and Core Team responsibilities, MAJCOM/IGs will notify the AFIA/TI at least
60 calendar days prior to inspection execution (refer to paragraphs 4.14.2. and 7.3).
MAJCOM/IGs will notify Nuclear Enterprise agencies of the inspection commencement and
conclusion using Attachment 4.
   4.5.1. Frequency of NSIs.
       4.5.1.1. Inspection Frequency. Conduct NSIs of each nuclear-capable unit IAW DOD
       3150.2M. The frequency (date next scheduled inspection due) is based on the date of the
       unit outbrief.
           4.5.1.1.1. Waiver to Decertification Requirement for Expired NSI. If a nuclear-
           capable unit does not receive an NSI within the timing required by DOD 3150.2M,
           MAJCOM/CCs may elect to continue the certification of a unit by waiving the
           decertification requirement IAW CJCSI 3263.05. The MAJCOM/CC will notify
           agencies required by CJCSI 3263.05 and provide informational copies to the CSAF
           and recipients listed in Table A4.2, Group 1. Waiver notification will include the
           date of the scheduled NSI.
       4.5.1.2. No-Notice and Minimal-Notice NSIs. While not every full-scale NSI needs to
       be no-notice or minimal-notice, the inspection program should implement a measure of
       randomness to scheduled inspections. For each certified nuclear-capable unit, one out of
 56                                               AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013


       every three full-scale NSIs should be no-notice or minimal notice. Refer to paragraph
       2.10.1
   4.5.2. Sequencing with other inspections. MAJCOMs may conduct NSIs sequentially with
   other inspections.
4.6. Limited Nuclear Surety Inspection (LNSI). The LNSI is limited in scope and does not
evaluate all NSI areas applicable to the unit. An LNSI is designed to assess sustained
performance of nuclear surety while minimizing the inspection footprint on a unit’s operations.
In order to meet Oversight and Core Team responsibilities, MAJCOM/IGs will notify the
AFIA/TI at least 60 calendar days prior to inspection execution (refer to paragraphs 4.14.2. and
7.3.). MAJCOM/IGs will notify Nuclear Enterprise agencies of the inspection commencement
and conclusion using Attachment 4.
   4.6.1. MAJCOMs may conduct LNSIs to:
       4.6.1.1. Inspect one or more areas designated by the MAJCOM/CC or IG.
       4.6.1.2. Re-inspect MGA or sub-area(s) of a certified nuclear-capable unit that
       contributed to an overall UNSATISFACTORY or SUPPORT UNSATISFACTORY
       rating during a Defense Nuclear Surety Inspection (DNSI), NSI, or LNSI.
       4.6.1.3. Re-inspect MGA or sub-area(s) of a certified nuclear-capable unit that
       contributed to an adjectival MARGINAL or UNACCEPTABLE rating during a DNSI,
       NSI, or LNSI.
   4.6.2. No-Notice and Minimal-Notice LNSIs. (Refer to paragraph 2.10.1) Each MAJCOM
   will conduct no-notice and/or minimal-notice LNSIs and determine appropriately-sized
   teams to target specific areas of concern or interest (e.g. a planned technical operation,
   logistics movement, security exercise, etc). While LNSIs may be scheduled, no-notice, or
   minimal-notice inspections, each nuclear-capable unit will receive at least one no-notice or
   minimal-notice LNSI between each NSI. MAJCOM/IGs may conduct no-notice or minimal-
   notice LNSIs for a variety of reasons; however the LNSI does not establish a new or alter the
   existing DoD-directed NSI inspection frequency.
       4.6.2.1. MAJCOM/IGs may exempt units from this LNSI requirement if a full-scale NSI
       is conducted at least every 12 months.
       4.6.2.2. Each MAJCOM IG will ensure units not receiving an LNSI between each NSI
       will have a Memo for Record signed by the MAJCOM/CC approving/exempting the unit
       from an LNSI. This memo shall reside with SAF/IGI.
4.7. Nuclear Inspection Rating System.
   4.7.1. For INSIs, assign a Ready or Not Ready rating.
   4.7.2. For NSIs, assign overall unit ratings and MGA adjectival ratings as specified for
   NWTIs in CJCSI 3263.05 with the following exception:
       4.7.2.1. Rate unit weapons denial and recapture/recovery emergency exercise as
       ACCEPTABLE or UNACCEPTABLE (a pass or fail rating).
   4.7.3. For LNSIs, assign overall unit ratings as specified for NSIs in CJCSI 3263.05.
   Assigning MGA adjectival ratings will be at the discretion of the MAJCOM/IG. Unless an
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                            57


   MGA was inspected to the same level/depth of a full-scale NSI, adjectival ratings should be
   limited to ACCEPTABLE, MARGINAL or UNACCEPTABLE.
4.8. Reporting Criteria. For NSIs, LNSIs, and INSIs, reports will only identify Strengths,
Deficiencies, and RIAs. RIAs will not be used to document procedural deviations or non-
compliance; they should be used to recommend a more efficient or effective course of action.
   4.8.1. Nuclear Surety Deficiencies and Corrective Actions. For reporting purposes, each
   NSI, LNSI, or INSI deficiency, as defined in CJCSI 3263.05, will:
       4.8.1.1. Be categorized as CRITICAL, SIGNIFICANT, or MINOR as defined in CJCSI
       3263.05.
       4.8.1.2. Be assigned a unique tracking number.
       4.8.1.3. Reference the applicable instruction, technical order, or other source
       documentation.
       4.8.1.4. Address impact of continued deviation or noncompliance.
       4.8.1.5. Identify the OPR for correcting the deficiency.
       4.8.1.6. Include the OCR, if applicable.
       4.8.1.7. Provide additional comments required to explain deficiency, if applicable.
   4.8.2. Corrective Actions. See paragraph 2.16.
       4.8.2.1. Host and Tenant Deficiencies. When responsibility for corrective actions is
       assigned to both the host and tenant unit (or supported and supporting unit),
       MAJCOM/IGs will communicate to ensure primary (OPR) and collateral (OCR)
       responsibility actions for deficiency resolution have properly occurred.
       4.8.2.2. Deficiencies Outside Inspected Unit’s Control. Deficiencies attributed to
       inspecting MAJCOM staff will be managed by the MAJCOM/IG using the same process
       as described in paragraph 2.16 For deficiencies outside the inspecting MAJCOM’s
       control, the supporting MAJCOM's staff and IG CARS monitor will coordinate replies
       through inspecting MAJCOM/IG and AFIA. AFIA will monitor and request updates
       from the responsible agency.
       4.8.2.3. For deficiencies from DTRA Inspections, see paragraph 4.13.2 and CJCSI
       3263.05 added instructions.
4.9. NSI Inspector Rules of Engagement (ROE).
   4.9.1. ROE #1. Inspectors will use applicable instructions, technical orders (T.O.), etc. as the
   inspection standard for the documentation, operation, process, and procedure observed or
   otherwise inspected.     Absent direct observation, authoritative documentation (e.g.
   maintenance logs) takes precedent. The IG Team Chief bases conclusions on facts collected
   through direct observation (e.g., commission or omission of an act during a technical
   operation) or authoritative documents. Inspectors may consider testimonial inputs, but
   assertions usually do not carry the same weight as direct observation or documentary
   evidence.
 58                                               AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013


   4.9.2. ROE #2. No NSI compliance credit will be given after inspector intervention.
   Inspectors will intervene to ensure safety, security, and reliability of WR. When inspector
   intervention drives eventual unit compliance, the inspected unit does not earn credit for
   compliance for the purposes of the NSI.
   4.9.3. ROE #3. When determining the impact severity of missed tests/inspections, the IG
   Team Chief will consult with SMEs to determine the reliability impact of a specific
   omitted/improper test/inspection.
   4.9.4. ROE #4. IGs cannot postulate that a follow-on test(s) and inspection(s) will be
   accomplished or identify possible malfunction. IG recognizes there are follow-on tests and
   inspections that have a very high probability of detecting possible malfunctions that went
   undetected by the omitted test and inspection. However, designed-in redundancy must be
   weighed against CJSCI 3263.05, C-2.c. Regardless if all follow on tests and inspections are
   accomplished as required, IGs should not postulate the inevitability that such future tests and
   inspections would identify any malfunctions induced by defects that the omitted test and
   inspection is designed to uncover.
4.10. DOD NSI MGAs. This Instruction does not replicate the information contained in CJCSI
3263.05. The criteria below add AF-specific inspection specifications and requirements to
existing DOD criteria:
   4.10.1. Management and Administration.
      4.10.1.1. Management. Evaluate leadership, guidance, communication, and attitude of
      unit commander and key supervisors. When assessing management, consider whether
      deficiencies are the result of individual error or reflect management or supervisory
      training/experience gaps.
      4.10.1.2. Administration.
          4.10.1.2.1. Evaluate weapons loading and management to include loading
          standardization, certification, training programs and schedules. Evaluate for certain
          non-US delivery aircraft, status, certification procedures and records.
          4.10.1.2.2. Reentry system mating management to include standardization, training
          and certification programs, and maintenance plans as required.
          4.10.1.2.3. Status of approved security or safety waivers, exemptions, deviations and
          exceptions.
          4.10.1.2.4. Munitions Control. Evaluate Munitions Control in the planning,
          coordinating, directing and controlling munitions/weapons activities IAW applicable
          AFIs.
          4.10.1.2.5. Munitions/Maintenance Plans and Scheduling (P&S).           Evaluate IAW
          applicable AFIs.
          4.10.1.2.6. Evaluate the certification processes and documentation of unit
          certified/qualified personnel (e.g., aircrew and missile combat crew members)
          assigned to duties involving nuclear weapons. At a minimum, review the records of
          all personnel certified/qualified since the previous NSI. For INSIs, review a
          sufficient sample of records to achieve a 95% statistical confidence rate.
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                         59


  4.10.2. Technical Operations.
     4.10.2.1. Evaluate each type of assigned weapon(s) or weapon system(s) units are tasked
     to support to assess safety, security, reliability and technical performance. These
     evaluations will be limited to those operations on which personnel are required to
     maintain certification. All record actions and reporting normally associated with the
     operation will be evaluated. MAJCOM inspectors will determine the scope and definitive
     start/stop of technical operations. In order to minimize the inspection footprint and
     mirror day-to-day unit operations, this inspection activity will evaluate unit certified
     teams performing NWTI-required technical operations with minimal QA and other unit
     leadership presence.
     4.10.2.2. For all technical operations and/or task evaluations the MAJCOM inspectors
     will brief items in paragraphs 4.10.2.2.3.1 thru 4.10.2.2.3.7. below to all personnel to be
     evaluated prior to the start of the evaluation. Units may be required to submit team
     assignment documents, duty rosters, unit committed munitions lists, maintenance
     capability letters, etc, to the MAJCOM/IG before team arrival to expedite team selection.
     Evaluate individual Career Field Education Training Plans (CFETP), Training Business
     Area (TBA), Load Training and Certification Document (AF IMT Forms 2435), PRP
     status, and work shifts when making team selections (maintain team integrity to the
     maximum extent possible).
        4.10.2.2.1. Unit assessors, QA, and weapons standardization evaluators are also
        subject to evaluation. The MAJCOM/IG may task these personnel to perform an
        evaluation of a maintenance operation within their area of responsibility. MAJCOM
        inspectors will clearly identify technical operations and/or task evaluations that
        require QA participation and evaluation of the QA function.
        4.10.2.2.2. During evaluation of any nuclear-certified procedure, the MAJCOM
        inspectors are to inspect the performance of only those individuals/team required by
        the applicable T.O. or guiding instruction for the procedure. Intervention,
        participation or influence by any other personnel (e.g., QA, Wing Weapons Officer,
        unit leadership) may be cause to terminate the procedure if, in the judgment of the
        Inspector, the outside assistance calls into question the technical proficiency or
        knowledge of the team under evaluation.
        4.10.2.2.3. As a minimum, the MAJCOM inspector task in-brief will include:
            4.10.2.2.3.1. Inspectors will stop an operation or task only after all reasonable
            opportunities to detect the deficient condition have passed or if conditions are
            detected that would jeopardize personnel or weapon safety, security, weapon
            system reliability, and/or cause equipment damage.
            4.10.2.2.3.2. All personnel who perform in process inspections (IPIs), or provide
            technical help IAW AFI 21-series guidance will be included in all evaluations.
            4.10.2.2.3.3. If required, QA or unit supervisors may observe the operation;
            however, inputs will be limited to preventing actual safety, security or reliability
            errors IAW paragraph 4.10.2.2
            4.10.2.2.3.4. If an abnormal situation presents itself and it is not covered in
60                                               AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013


            technical data, consult with your supervision. The MAJCOM inspector will
            expect a full assessment of the nature of the problem and what actions are taken to
            correct or report the problem. All sources of information will be evaluated.
            4.10.2.2.3.5. MAJCOM inspectors may review all paperwork generated as a
            result of the technical operation or task evaluations.
            4.10.2.2.3.6. MAJCOM inspectors will approve all simulations and deviations
            prior to the start of the technical operation or task to include all previously
            complied with (PCW) steps.
            4.10.2.2.3.7. MAJCOM inspectors are not on PRP, therefore, inspectors cannot
            be a part of a TWO-PERSON team. Inspectors will not intentionally violate the
            TWO-PERSON concept.
     4.10.2.3. Weapons Maintenance Technical Operations. Evaluate applicable technical
     operations designated in CJCSI 3263.05, for which the unit is tasked in their Maintenance
     Capability Letters (MCL) and Unit Committed Munitions Lists (UCML). For
     comparable operations evaluate only one weapon system type. Certain operations listed
     individually may be combined for the purpose of inspection. Inspectors will approve the
     starting and stopping configuration before the operation. Inspectors must observe
     technical operations that clearly demonstrate unit’s ability to perform its assigned nuclear
     mission. During weapons maintenance technical operations evaluate adherence to
     technical data, documentation, overall safety, security and reliability of observed
     operations, to include final assembly testing.
     4.10.2.4. Loading and Mating.
        4.10.2.4.1. Aircraft Generation/Flightline Operations. Evaluate ability to conduct a
        complete weapons upload, from initial command post message tasking to weapons
        break-out through aircrew acceptance and applicable post-load procedures. Loading
        operation must encompass each type and upload position (internal and external), as
        weapon system applicable. Loading standardization crew/weapons standardization
        load crews/squadron load crews may be evaluated. Note: For custodial units
        supporting non-US delivery organizations include the US technical load monitor
        activity.
        4.10.2.4.2. Static Loading Operations. Evaluate ability to conduct weapons
        upload/download and applicable post-load procedures. Static loading operations must
        encompass each type and upload position (internal and external), as weapon system
        applicable.       Loading standardization crew/weapons standardization load
        crews/squadron load crews may be evaluated. The environment in which static
        loading is conducted demonstrates technical proficiency and standardization of the
        weapons load crew training program. Units may simulate some aspects of security,
        entry control, approved explosive loading site plans, and/or other operations that
        cannot be reasonably conducted in a load training facility. Note: For custodial units
        supporting non-US delivery organizations include the US technical load monitor and
        associated training activities.
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                           61


  4.10.3. Tools, Test, Tiedown and Handling Equipment.
     4.10.3.1. AF Registered Motor Vehicles and Vehicular Equipment. Evaluate vehicle
     management control, accountability and maintenance practices for ensuring nuclear-
     certified vehicles and vehicular equipment are maintained in a safe and serviceable
     condition. Evaluate vehicle operator/using organization's ability to perform applicable
     operator's maintenance and documentation requirements on nuclear-certified vehicles and
     vehicular equipment to ensure safe and serviceable condition. Evaluate unit operator
     training and certification program to ensure compliance with applicable guidance.
     4.10.3.2. Equipment. Evaluate unit equipment management to ensure only nuclear
     certified software, testers/cables and equipment is used in support of the nuclear mission.
     Evaluate equipment is being maintained in a serviceable condition, current equipment
     calibration dates and equipment limitations/restrictions are adhered to.
  4.10.4. Condition of the Stockpile.
     4.10.4.1. Sample Size.        Examine fifty percent (50%), as a minimum, of the
     active/inactive coded assets and associated bolsters, containers, and records in igloo
     storage and at least twenty-five percent (25%) of active/inactive assets and associated
     bolsters, containers, and records in long term storage facilities and/or weapon storage
     vaults to ensure they are stored in accordance with weapons-specific T.O.s.
     4.10.4.2. Retirement Assets. Examine ten percent (10%), as a minimum, of weapons
     coded for retirement and associated records to ensure safe and secure storage in
     accordance with applicable explosive, nuclear safety and nuclear security criteria,
     weapons-specific T.O.s and retirement unit requirements contained in T.O. 11N-35-51,
     Department of Defense Nuclear Weapons Technical Inspection System.
     4.10.4.3. Ensure weapons are stored in a safe and reliable configuration and in
     accordance with applicable directives. (i.e., properly grounded, chocked, immobilized.)
     Ensure weapons have proper spacing, storage compatibility, and are within explosive and
     active material limits. If defects are discovered on weapons, components or equipment
     during stockpile walkthroughs, ensure evaluation against applicable technical publication,
     technical order, or instruction and ensure appropriate corrective actions are taken and
     documented.
     4.10.4.4. Containers shall not be opened for the purpose of inspection; however, when
     the state of the item or the condition or accuracy of records is suspect, the container shall
     be opened and a visual inspection of the item and record entries made, if required. The
     determination to open containers shall be made by the NWTI Chief Inspector.
     4.10.4.5. For assets with storage bags attached sample a number of bags to ensure all
     required items are located in the storage bag and properly packaged and or sealed.
     Ensure the weapons inspection record card information matches the asset/container
     markings (P/N, Drop Numbers, S/N, ALTs, etc).
  4.10.5. Storage and Maintenance Facilities.
     4.10.5.1. Evaluate roads in storage areas, between storage and loading or missile launch
     areas.
62                                               AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013


     4.10.5.2. Evaluate nuclear-certified hoists to ensure, at a minimum, hoists are
     serviceable, authorized, and have received mandatory load testing and/or safety related
     inspections.
  4.10.6. Security.
     4.10.6.1. Evaluate unit compliance with DOD S-5210.41M_ AFMAN 31-108 and other
     required security standards for protecting WR weapons and weapon systems. Security
     inspection sub-areas and inspection methodology are depicted in Attachment 4, Table
     A4.1. Performance-based criteria, where designated, will be the primary means of the
     inspection. Compliance with existing requirements will be assessed through random
     sampling, and where practical, in conjunction with exercise events and/or task
     evaluations. Compliance with established requirements will be considered when
     determining the overall security area rating.
     4.10.6.2. MAJCOMs will supplement this section to ensure their specific operating
     environments and elements of the published Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Nuclear
     Security Threat Capabilities Assessment (NSTCA, 2005-2015) are addressed while
     ensuring safe exercise conditions to meet exercise objectives.
     4.10.6.3. Weapon Denial and Recapture Exercise Planning:
         4.10.6.3.1. MAJCOM/IGs working with their staff functional counterparts and AFIA
         will develop realistic nuclear weapon security exercise scenarios to determine a unit's
         ability to meet the Nuclear Weapons Security Standards (NWSS). The MAJCOM/IG
         team will determine the exercise scenario and coordinate scenario with DTRA during
         DNSI planning.
         4.10.6.3.2. Risk Management and safety procedures will be used in planning and
         execution of security exercises at all levels of command. When exercises are
         collocated within operational areas, care will be exercised to avoid scenarios that
         could be interpreted as an actual hostile situation that might cause accidental injury or
         illness to personnel or jeopardize the security of nuclear resources.
         4.10.6.3.3. At IG discretion, exercise scenarios resulting in the opposing force
         (OPFOR) gaining access to nuclear weapons may automatically trigger the recapture
         or recovery exercise, as applicable. Inspectors will ensure both the OPFOR and
         exercise controllers know the ―adversary intentions‖ for the planned attack (e.g.,
         sabotage weapon, destruction, theft, etc.).
         4.10.6.3.4. All participants will apply appropriate INFOSEC and OPSEC measures to
         safeguard exercise information, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). Likewise,
         the results of NSIs security exercises, or other like inspections under the auspices of
         the IG, will be appropriately classified, rated, critiqued, and reported for cross-tell
         purposes within the nuclear community.
     4.10.6.4. OPFOR Planning. Exercise scenarios will portray an OPFOR that replicates
     adversaries identified in the published DIA NSTCA. Likewise, OPFOR capabilities will
     be matched as best as possible IAW this document to evaluate the unit’s integrated effort
     to meet the NWSS. Ensure distinct separation of exercise play area from real world
     mission areas using visual identification tools (safety vest/belts, exercise controllers),
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                        63


     safety briefings for trusted agents and normal exercise Command and Control (C2)
     communication announcements. All OPFOR, exercise controllers, and IG trusted agents
     will be under the operational direction of the inspecting IG.
     4.10.6.5. Security Deviations. MAJCOM inspectors will review the number and types of
     MAJCOM-approved security deviations as well as assess the adequacy of and
     compliance with, associated compensatory measures.
     4.10.6.6. Performance-based Assessment Methodology. When measuring performance
     to determine whether a unit meets the NWSS, inspectors shall apply the following
     methodology during their observation:
        4.10.6.6.1. Observe and evaluate the integrated execution of security actions and
        responses (performance), and compliance with technical criteria, as applicable.
        Provide performance-based (Acceptable/Unacceptable) rates for exercises by
        factoring:
            4.10.6.6.1.1. The timeliness/quality/strength of security/support force responses.
            For example, did the unit meet the tenets of the NWSS (i.e., Deny access or
            regain custody?).
            4.10.6.6.1.2. Execution of applicable plans and TTPs. For example, did the unit
            make sufficient effort to immediately deny access or regain custody?
            4.10.6.6.1.3. Effect of active/passive defenses, deployed delay/denial systems,
            and other technology. For example, did the unit use available options to prevent
            the loss of/deny access to nuclear weapons to the adversary to include destruction
            of the weapon?
            4.10.6.6.1.4. Unit application of integrated base defense activities in the overall
            effort to meet the NWSS. For example, did the unit bring available resources to
            bear on the event (e.g., technology, TTPs, EOD, etc.)?
        4.10.6.6.2. Determine the effect (outcome) of executed security action(s) and
        response (performance), in conjunction with the impact of unit compliance with
        technical criteria and contribution of supporting security systems, as applicable, (see
        Attachment 4, Table A4.1) to determine if the NWSS was met. For example:
            4.10.6.6.2.1. Did the unit effectively execute applicable plans and employ
            sufficient forces in their effort to meet the NWSS?
            4.10.6.6.2.2. Was unit C2 effective?
            4.10.6.6.2.3. Did the unit up-channel information in sufficient detail and on time
            to appropriate HHQ agencies?
            4.10.6.6.2.4. Were unit TTPs and applied security technology effective in
            meeting the objective?
            4.10.6.6.2.5. Was unauthorized access denied or weapons custody regained?
        4.10.6.6.3. Modeling and Simulation. As available and applicable, the inspector may
        use computer modeling and simulation as a viable measuring tool for developing
        response force scenarios based on the published DIA NSTCA.
64                                               AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013


  4.10.7. Safety.
     4.10.7.1. Compliance with explosive safety standards, explosives and active material
     limits, and Weapons System Safety Rules.
     4.10.7.2. Nuclear Surety Program. Evaluate compliance, programs, implementation and
     management thereof per AFI 91-101, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program.
     4.10.7.3. Assess Air Force Fire Emergency Services (FES) flights utilizing the FES
     Assessment Program (FESAP).
     4.10.7.4. Nuclear Weapons Intrinsic Radiation Safety Program. Conduct a limited spot-
     check inspection of the Intrinsic Radiation Safety Program to ensure controls are in place
     and personnel practice as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) concepts when
     practical.
  4.10.8. Supply Support. Refer to CJCSI 3263.05.
  4.10.9. Nuclear Weapon Personnel Reliability Program (PRP). Evaluate PRP IAW DOD
  5210.42-R_AFMAN 10-3902. In addition to the areas listed in CJCSI 3263.05, the training
  program for all personnel who are part of the PRP shall be examined.
     4.10.9.1. PRP inspection teams should include an experienced or current certifying
     official, an experienced unit PRP monitor, and an experienced competent medical
     authority.
     4.10.9.2. Inspectors will assess the administrative qualification, certification, continuing
     evaluation, removal from PRP duties, return to duty, training and management processes,
     using record reviews and scenario-based exercises along with certifying official
     interviews to substantiate above processes, employed by the unit. PRP processes, not
     records reviews, will be the primary focus. Records reviews will be based on a 95%
     statistical confidence rate. Record review will be consistent with the time period
     established in the DODM 5210.42.
  4.10.10. Logistics Movement. Evaluate all units supporting or having responsibility for
  logistics movement of nuclear weapons by observing weapon breakout, preparation for
  shipment, transfer/transport, loading, unloading, receipt/verification and custody transfer
  procedures of representative types of weapons. The team should conduct the inspection
  (other than an INSI) during missions involving WR weapons when available. Evaluate:
     4.10.10.1. Convoy operations. Includes operational movements to or from launch
     facilities and weapon movement activities to include security support. For ICBM units,
     the capability to transfer/transport, load/unload, tiedown and transfer custody of weapons
     for payload transfer missions may be evaluated as a logistics movement.
     4.10.10.2. Explosives and active material limits. Observe compatibility of items during
     transportation.
     4.10.10.3. Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) Support. Evaluate PNAF support plans,
     security support, and logistics movement IAW applicable AFIs for PNAF certified units
     and installations supporting nuclear airlift missions. Logistics airlift units must
     demonstrate ability to safely and properly load, transport, unload, and transfer custody of
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                             65


      weapons. Note: For PNAF units, security support will be evaluated for aircrew security
      actions during the PNAF movement as required by the applicable AFIs.
4.11. AF NSI MGAs. In addition to the MGAs outlined in CJCSI 3263.05, the following
MGAs (in bold print) will also be inspected, as applicable:
   4.11.1. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). Evaluate (1) classroom and practical
   training program, (2) condition of facilities and vehicles, (3) availability, serviceability, and
   demonstrated use of nuclear support equipment, (4) maintenance of technical orders,
   operating instructions, Team Chief Guides, AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health
   Record, AF Form 623, Individual Training Record, and other related publications, (5) initial
   and annual certification and decertification documentation, if required, (6) knowledge of
   hazardous and classified weapons components, and (7) render safe procedures (RSP) and
   continuation of RSP.
   4.11.2. Nuclear Control Order Procedures. Evaluate CP, aircrew, Permissive Action
   Link/Code Management System lock/unlock teams, and missile crew responses to nuclear
   control orders as well as effectiveness of applicable C2 functions IAW HHQ directives.
   4.11.3. Emergency Exercises.
      4.11.3.1. Weapons Denial. Rate the weapons denial portion of this area using an
      ACCEPTABLE or UNACCEPTABLE (pass or fail) rating. The evaluation will also
      consider:
          4.11.3.1.1. The wing/installation's assessment of the threat and immediacy of actions
          taken during response.
          4.11.3.1.2. The effectiveness of the planning, training, and exercising of tasked
          agencies and/or activities to counter an overt attack or preparations for an overt
          attack.
          4.11.3.1.3. The use of available wing/installation resources to counter an overt attack.
      4.11.3.2. Weapons Recapture. Rate the weapons recapture portion of this area using an
      ACCEPTABLE or UNACCEPTABLE (pass or fail) rating. The evaluation will also
      consider:
          4.11.3.2.1. The wing/installation's assessment of the threat and immediacy of actions
          taken during recapture/recovery.
          4.11.3.2.2. The effectiveness of the planning, training, and exercising of tasked
          agencies and/or activities.
          4.11.3.2.3. The use of available wing/installation resources to recover from an overt
          attack.
      4.11.3.3. Emergency Evacuation. (USAFE Units only). Rate on an ACCEPTABLE or
      UNACCEPTABLE (a pass or fail rating) basis. Evaluate unit plans and procedures to
      evacuate assets IAW command directives. The unit, as tasked by HHQ, must
      demonstrate the ability to effectively and safely perform and report emergency
      evacuation operations in accordance with HHQ directives.
66                                             AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013


     4.11.3.4. Command Disablement. Rate on an ACCEPTABLE or UNACCEPTABLE (a
     pass or fail rating) basis. Evaluate the unit’s plans and procedures to meet the primary
     objective to render weapons tactically useless and for the removal, storage, and
     destruction of specified WR components according to HHQ directives. The unit must
     demonstrate the ability to effectively and safely perform and report, in accordance with
     HHQ directives, command disablement actions whether tasked by HHQ or to prevent the
     unauthorized use of WR weapons should hostile forces threaten to seize them. The IG
     inspection team will provide the necessary exercise injects that would prompt command
     disablement implementation. The scope of the task evaluation may range from the
     interview of individuals with the responsibility for conducting command disablement
     operations to demonstration of procedures using training munitions.
     4.11.3.5. Emergency Response. Rate on an ACCEPTABLE or UNACCEPTABLE (a
     pass or fail rating) basis. Evaluate the wing/installation's response to any emergency
     situation to determine how effectively base resources are used in areas where WR
     weapons or weapon systems may be located (e.g., in storage, in maintenance, in convoy).
     Use realistic scenarios that are based on the Local Nuclear Security Threat Capabilities
     Assessment (LNSTCA). Emergency response exercise deficiencies, strengths and
     recommended improvement areas will be taken into account for participating parties
     when determining the adjectival ratings for their respective MGA(s). (i.e., Management
     & Administration for leadership guidance and communications; Safety for compliance
     with Weapon System Safety Rules (WSSRs), Nuclear Surety Program and Nuclear
     Weapons Intrinsic Radiation Safety Program/ALARA concepts; EOD for render safe
     procedures; and Security for applicable DoD and USAF supplemented security
     requirements). Note: WR weapons will not be used in emergency exercises.
        4.11.3.5.1. Evaluate the response of tasked agencies including initial-response teams,
        disaster response force (DRF), SF, munitions/maintenance, wing safety, civil
        engineers, Emergency Management, Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Fire Emergency
        Services, medical, C2, and follow-on recovery operations as the exercise scenario
        dictates. The evaluation will also consider:
            4.11.3.5.1.1. The command, control, and communications (C3) of all forces
            involved.
            4.11.3.5.1.2. The implementation of the installation emergency management and
            force protection plans, as applicable.
            4.11.3.5.1.3. Timeliness and accuracy of required reports.
            4.11.3.5.1.4. Emergency Entry to Exclusion/Limited Areas. Evaluate the
            wing/installation's ability to emergency in/out process emergency responders
            to/from exclusion and limited areas.
     4.11.3.6. An UNACCEPTABLE rating will be awarded for the Emergency Exercise area
     when:
        4.11.3.6.1. Unit response forces do not meet DOD S-5210.41M_AFMAN 31-108
        timing criteria.
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                           67


          4.11.3.6.2. Unit response forces do not conduct recapture operations as specified in
          DOD S-5210.41M_AFMAN 31-108, CJCSI 3261.01A, Recapture and Recovery of
          Nuclear Weapons, and CJCSI 3261.02A, Recapture and Recovery Response Force
          Guidance. An ACCEPTABLE grade will be based on either successful denial or
          effective and timely recapture/recovery of affected nuclear weapon(s). When initial
          denial fails and the unit is not capable of regaining custody in a timely manner, the
          overall unit rate will be UNACCEPTABLE. Failure of a unit to initially deny
          unauthorized access or subsequent loss of custody of nuclear weapons does not
          automatically result in a failing grade for exercises. In these cases, IGs must consider
          specific nuclear weapon type, site-specific physical delay/denial mechanisms, site
          topography, climate, location, and adversary objective, as well as the effort of the
          security/support force to disrupt/delay an adversary’s task and cause duress to the
          adversary as the exercise scenario plays out.
          4.11.3.6.3. Unit fails to re-establish adequate security and access control for a WR
          weapon or weapon system.
   4.11.4. Use Control. Evaluate Permissive Action Link/Code Management System,
   Command Disablement System, Positive Enable System and Active Protection System
   operations per CJCSI 3260.01B, Joint Policy Governing Positive Control Material and
   Devices, and other applicable HHQ directives.
      4.11.4.1. Award an UNACCEPTABLE rating when the unit's failure to follow
      authorized procedures for receipt, storage, control, destruction and issue of sealed
      authenticators or class 3 code management system/weapon coding equipment results in:
      loss of positive inventory control, unauthorized destruction or unauthorized issue of
      required materials; or incorrect codes/documents being positioned/installed in
      weapons/weapon control panels.
4.12. Re-inspection of NSI/LNSI Deficient Areas.
   4.12.1. When the unit receives an overall UNSATISFACTORY rating, the deficient areas
   that caused or contributed to the overall UNSATISFACTORY rating must be re-inspected
   using one of the following methods, as determined by the Team Chief:
      4.12.1.1. Re-inspect Prior to Termination. The team chief may conduct an ―on-the-spot‖
      re-inspection prior to terminating the inspection. If the on-the-spot re-inspection
      indicates the deficiency is non-systemic and is sufficiently corrected to permit operations,
      a follow-up inspection is not required.
          4.12.1.1.1. The adjectival rating for the ―on-the-spot‖ re-inspected area(s) will not
          exceed ACCEPTABLE. If all deficient areas are successfully re-inspected, the
          overall unit rating will be UNSATISFACTORY (Re-inspected to SATISFACTORY).
          4.12.1.1.2. Do not re-inspect prior to termination if the Team Chief determines on-
          the-spot re-inspection is inappropriate, or if:
             4.12.1.1.2.1. The failure is due to a systemic problem or a general lack of
             proficiency within the unit.
             4.12.1.1.2.2. Suspension of nuclear weapon operations is in the best interest of
             nuclear safety, security, or reliability.
 68                                              AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013


      4.12.1.2. Re-inspect After Termination. In instances where re-inspection prior to
      termination is not appropriate as determined by the Team Chief or re-inspected area(s)
      are not sufficiently corrected, the MAJCOM/IG will schedule an LNSI re-inspection NLT
      90 days from termination of the NSI.
         4.12.1.2.1. LNSI Re-inspection Rating. If all deficient areas are successfully re-
         inspected, the overall unit rating for this LNSI will be RE-INSPECTED TO
         SATISFACTORY. Assigning MGA adjectival ratings will be at the discretion of the
         MAJCOM. Unless an MGA was inspected to the same level/depth of a full-scale
         NSI, adjectival ratings should be limited to ACCEPTABLE, MARGINAL or
         UNACCEPTABLE. Document re-inspection results IAW Attachment 4 and
         forward to Table A4.2, Group 1 addressees.
4.13. Actions on Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Inspections.
   4.13.1. Throughout the conduct of DNSIs, the MAJCOM/IG team will meet with the DTRA
   team to discuss inspection activities and potential deficiencies.
   4.13.2. DNSI Reports. Units will coordinate replies to DTRA reports through their
   appropriate MAJCOM/IG and AFIA. Take corrective action based on the field report
   provided by the DTRA team at the time of the inspection.
      4.13.2.1. CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT deficiencies require a description of the OPR’s
      corrective action (to include primary and, if applicable, contributing root causes) and a
      discussion of those measures or procedures initiated to preclude their recurrence. Closure
      of deficiencies requires a memorandum from the inspected unit to the MAJCOM/IG
      detailing corrective actions taken, and certification that all corrective actions are
      complete. (For DNSI reports, use CJCSI 3263.05, Encl F deficiency codes).
      4.13.2.2. The MAJCOM CARS monitor will coordinate on the MAJCOM response(s)
      and forward to AFIA/TIO with MAJCOM/IG concurrence. Corrective action response(s)
      are required within 90 days of the DNSI report date. If the corrective action report is not
      closed within 90 days of the date of the report, the MAJCOM CARS monitor will provide
      AFIA an update every 30 days on open deficiencies until the report is closed.
      4.13.2.3. AFIA will review and forward corrective action reports to DTRA
      recommending closure of deficiencies, as applicable.
      4.13.2.4. When all deficiencies are corrected, AFIA will request DTRA close the
      inspection report. AFIA will forward DTRA closure acceptance to MAJCOM/IG and
      CARS monitor.
      4.13.2.5. Deficiencies Outside Inspected Unit’s Control. Deficiencies attributed to
      inspecting MAJCOM staff will be managed by the MAJCOM/IG using the same process
      as described in paragraph 2.16 For deficiencies outside the inspecting MAJCOM’s
      control, AFIA will monitor and request updates from the responsible agency and forward
      to DTRA with the MAJCOM/IG update.
   4.13.3. Defense Nuclear Surety Oversight Inspections (DNSOI).            MAJCOM/IGs will
   courtesy copy AFIA/OV of all responses to DTRA DNSOIs.
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                            69



4.14. NSI Core Team.
   4.14.1. NSI Core Team Roles. (see paragraph 7.3.1). The NSI Core Team, when fully
   manned, has 22 certified NSI inspectors assigned. Core Team members will integrate with
   the MAJCOM/IG team for all NSIs creating a single inspection unit under the direction of
   the MAJCOM/IG Team Chief. When scheduling allows, NSI Core Team will have at least
   one representative for each MGA for which it is manned present at every NSI (e.g., Tech
   Ops, Security, Safety, PRP, NCOP, etc.); for INSIs and LNSIs, the Core Team make-up will
   be contingent upon the MGAs inspected.
   4.14.2. Planning. At least 60 calendar days prior to a scheduled inspection execution, the
   MAJCOM/IG Team and Core Team will begin collaboration on a draft Sequence of Events
   (SOE). For no-notice or minimal-notice NSIs/LNSIs, a tentative SOE will be drafted 60 days
   prior and finalized with the inspected unit upon formal notification.
       4.14.2.1. Ensure the SOE includes all CJCSI 3263.05 and MAJCOM NSI requirements,
       inspector task assignment (area of responsibility), and any inspection-unique
       circumstances or requirements.
       4.14.2.2. At least 15 calendar days prior to inspection execution, the MAJCOM/IG Team
       and Core Team will review and approve the inspected unit simulations and deviations
       and provide DTRA a copy when required by CJCSI 3263.05.
4.15. AF NSI Oversight Team.
   4.15.1. AF NSI Oversight Team Roles and Responsibilities. (see paragraph 7.3.2).
   4.15.2. Interaction with the Inspection Authority. During the course of the inspection,
   MAJCOM/IGs will allow AF Oversight Team members to be present for all in-briefs and
   out-briefs (including executive sessions), daily IG meetings, deficiency validation sessions
   with the inspected unit, and any discussions/validations with MAJCOM FAMs or SMEs.
   Oversight inspectors will be afforded access to all exercise areas and technical operations
   where authorized by EAL. MAJCOM/IG Team Chiefs will immediately notify the Oversight
   Team Chief of any potential CRITICAL deficiencies.
   4.15.3. Planning. The AF NSI Oversight Team may request MAJCOMs provide an
   approved SOE prior to inspection execution (e.g., INSIs).
4.16. Adjudication. Third party adjudication will occur for all types of nuclear surety
inspections when differences exist between inspecting teams and oversight teams when such
differences will affect the final overall rating of the unit. An adjudicated decision on the unit’s
overall rating will be reached before out-briefing the unit. Adjudication efforts will consult, and
may solicit inputs/positions from, all applicable resources available, within the nuclear
enterprise. Adjudication decisions will be resolved at the lowest level possible. Either the
MAJCOM/IG Team Chief or the NSI Oversight Team Chief may enter an overall unit inspection
rating into Level 1 adjudication, if needed.
   4.16.1. Level 1 Adjudication. In the event the MAJCOM/IG Team and the NSI Oversight
   Team cannot agree on an overall inspection rating, the MAJCOM/IG and AFIA/CC will
   collectively adjudicate the overall rating decision and provide that decision to the
   MAJCOM/IG Team Chief. The MAJCOM report will reflect the overall rating stemming
 70                                               AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013


   from this decision, but will neither include, nor disclose, elements of disagreement between
   the teams. The MAJCOM/IG or the AFIA/CC may enter an overall unit inspection rating
   into Level 2 adjudication, if needed.
   4.16.2. Level 2 Adjudication. If a Level 1 adjudication decision cannot be reached by the
   MAJCOM/IG and AFIA/CC, TIG will adjudicate an overall rating decision and provide that
   decision to the SECAF and MAJCOM/CC. The MAJCOM/CC will communicate TIG’s
   final overall rating to the MAJCOM/IG. The MAJCOM report will reflect the overall rating
   stemming from this decision, but will neither include, nor disclose, elements of disagreement.
   The AFIA Oversight report will include the details of the adjudication effort, to include the
   dissenting opinion(s).
   4.16.3. Based on TIG and A10 (NOB Secretariat) recommendation and SECAF/CSAF
   approval, adjudication insights may be included with other IG-related issues as agenda items
   at the NOB. All adjudication decisions decided below TIG will be included as agenda items
   at the next NSI process review.
   4.16.4. In all cases, the MAJCOM/CC will retain unit certification authority.
4.17. NSI Reports and Messages.
   4.17.1. Classification and Marking. Classify and mark all NSI, LNSI, and INSI reports and
   messages IAW CJCSI 3263.05, CG-W-5, Joint DOE/DOD Nuclear Weapons Classification
   Guide, TCG-WPMU-2, Joint DOE/DOD Topical Classification Guide for Weapon
   Production and Military Use, and Executive Order 13526, Classified National Security
   Information. (Reference paragraph 2.15.)
   4.17.2. Inspection Commencement Messages. MAJCOM/IGs will send an inspection
   commencement message to all recipients in Table A4.2, Group 1 NLT 24 hours after IG
   team in-brief of the unit. Use Figures A4.1 and A4.2 as a template.
   4.17.3. Executive Summary. MAJCOM/IGs will send an executive summary to all
   recipients in Figure A4.4, Group 1 within 5 days of IG team departure from inspected unit.
   Use Figure A4.2 as a template. An executive summary is not required if the MAJCOM/IG
   publishes and distributes the final report within the same 5 days.
   4.17.4. Formal Report. Document NSI, LNSI and INSI results in a report and distribute to
   all recipients in Figure A4.4, Group 1 within 30 days of inspection outbrief of the unit.
   Distribute the report to agencies in Figure A4.4, Group 2 as necessary. MAJCOM/IGs will
   ensure agencies not included in Groups 1 or 2 but identified as OPRs for corrective actions
   are included in the report distribution.       MAJCOM/IGs will annotate in their final
   MAJCOM/IG inspection report any associated DTRA inspection or AFIA oversight
   participation.
4.18. Nuclear Operational Readiness Inspection (NORI).
   4.18.1. Purpose. The NORI is a performance-based readiness evaluation of nuclear-tasked
   units which support tasked Combatant Commanders and Joint Chief of Staff (JCS)-directed
   OPLANs. NORIs require units to demonstrate their operational capability of nuclear and
   nuclear-support in a time-constrained environment.
   4.18.2. NORI Frequency. MAJCOMs will conduct NORIs on units with nuclear delivery
   systems at intervals not to exceed 36 months. Nuclear support units will receive a NORI at
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                         71


   intervals not to exceed 48 months, waiverable by MAJCOM/CC to 60 months. USAFE units
   will conform to the NATO Strike Evaluation frequencies. MAJCOM/IGs will notify SAF/IG
   when a unit will exceed the inspection interval and will provide the anticipated inspection
   date(s).
   4.18.3. NORI Rating Scale. Wing/installation overall performance, MGAs, and sub-areas
   will be rated using the five-tier rating system of Outstanding, Excellent, SATISFACTORY,
   Marginal, and UNSATISFACTORY. USAFE may award NORI credit for successful
   completion of the NATO Strike Evaluation (STRIKEVAL). To receive NORI credit from a
   STRIKEVAL, USAFE/IG must ensure specific events are observed by inspector personnel
   either augmenting the NATO team or specifically sent to observe the events.
   4.18.4. AF NORI MGAs. The focus of the NORI is force generation, employment, and
   reconstitution (as applicable). Surety and safety should be addressed in all applicable MGAs.
   All NORI MGAs and sub-areas, to include Surety will be rated.

   4.18.5. NORI Planning. When possible for AD (and required for ARC nuclear support no-
   notice or minimal-notice), inspections should coincide with unit participation in COCOM or
   MAJCOM annual Field Training Exercises (FTX). The MAJCOM/IG will coordinate with
   applicable MAJCOM and/or NAF Exercise Programs, NAF-staff, USSTRATCOM exercise
   planners, and unit trusted agents in developing a realistic exercise scenario that fulfills
   inspection requirements. NORIs will execute to the DOC statement. Written waivers to
   deviate from DOC statement will be submitted to the MAJCOM/IG.
       4.18.5.1. For units with both a nuclear and conventional mission, the NORI may be
       scheduled in conjunction or in sequence with a CUI Phase 1 & 2 or NSI.
       4.18.5.2. If sequential inspections are conducted to assess nuclear surety, conventional
       readiness, and/or nuclear readiness, inspection objectives and criteria must be clearly
       delineated.
       4.18.5.3. If conducted sequentially, each inspection type will have an independent report.
4.19. Re-inspection of NORI Deficient Areas.
   4.19.1. When the unit receives an overall UNSATISFACTORY rating, the deficient areas
   that caused or contributed to the UNSATISFACTORY rating must be re-inspected using one
   of the following methods, as determined by the Team Chief [See paragraph 4.3 for guidance
   concerning unit deficiencies and continued nuclear certification status, if applicable]:
       4.19.1.1. Re-inspect Prior to Termination. The team chief may conduct an ―on-the-spot‖
       re-inspection prior to terminating the inspection. If the on-the-spot re-inspection
       indicates the deficiency is non-systemic and is sufficiently corrected to permit operations,
       a follow-up inspection is not required.
          4.19.1.1.1. The adjectival rating for the ―on-the-spot‖ re-inspected area(s) will not
          exceed SATISFACTORY. If all deficient areas are successfully re-inspected, the
          overall unit rating will be UNSATISFACTORY (Re-inspected to SATISFACTORY).
          4.19.1.1.2. Do not re-inspect prior to termination if the Team Chief determines on-
          the-spot re-inspection is inappropriate, or if:
              4.19.1.1.2.1. The failure is due to a systemic problem or a general lack of
              proficiency within the unit.

              4.19.1.1.2.2. Suspension of nuclear weapon operations is in the best interest of
              nuclear safety, security, or reliability. If necessary, reference paragraph 4.3, for
              decertification guidance.
      4.19.1.2. Re-inspect After Termination. In instances where re-inspection prior to
      termination is not appropriate as determined by the Team Chief or re-inspected area(s)
      are not sufficiently corrected, MAJCOM/CCs will establish re-inspection timelines to
      ensure deficiencies are resolved and unit readiness to support National war plans is
      verified as soon as practical but NLT 90 days from termination of the inspection.
          4.19.1.2.1. If all deficient areas are successfully re-inspected, the overall unit rating
          will be RE-INSPECTED TO SATISFACTORY. Adjectival ratings will not be
          assigned.
4.20. NORI Corrective Actions. See paragraph 2.16.8
4.21. NORI Reports and Messages.
   4.21.1. Classification and Marking. Classify and mark all NORI reports and messages IAW
   CG-W-5, Joint DOE/DOD Nuclear Weapons Classification Guide, TCG-WPMU-2, Joint
   DOE/DOD Topical Classification Guide for Weapon Production and Military Use, and
   Executive Order 13526 as amended, Classified National Security Information. (Reference
   paragraph 2.15.).
   4.21.2. Inspection Commencement Messages. MAJCOM/IGs will send an inspection
   commencement message to all recipients in Figure A4.4, Group 1 NLT 24 hours after IG
   team in-brief of the unit. Use Attachment 4, Figure A4.1 as a template.
   4.21.3. Executive Summary. MAJCOM/IGs will send an executive summary to all
   recipients in Figure A4.4, Group 1 within 5 days of IG team departure from inspected unit.
   Use Attachment 4, Figure A4.2 as a template. An executive summary is not required if the
   MAJCOM/IG publishes and distributes the final report within the same 5 days.
   4.21.4. Formal Report. Document NORI results in a report and distribute to all recipients in
   Figure A4.4, Group 1 within 30 days of inspection out-brief of the unit. Distribute the
   report to agencies in Figure A4.4, Group 2 as necessary. MAJCOM/IGs will ensure
   agencies not included in Groups 1 or 2 but identified as OPRs for corrective actions are
   included in the report distribution. [Exception: All requests for USAFE reports must be
   routed through the appropriate NATO office.]

                                           Chapter 5

                                JOINT BASE INSPECTIONS

5.1. Purpose. This chapter provides general guidance for conducting inspections at a Joint Base
(JB) where the AF is either the supporting or the supported Component. MAJCOM supplements
to this publication will include MAJCOM-specific guidance for JB inspections within their
command.
5.2. Background.
   5.2.1. The Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 2005 law established 12 JBs and,
   simultaneously, directed the relocation of installation support functions from one Service to
   another. At some locations, the installation support is provided by other Services and the AF
   is the Supported Component. At other locations, the AF provides installation support and is
   the Supporting Component. These two variations create different approaches to inspections.
   5.2.2. A key enabler to the success of Joint Basing is the establishment of DOD-wide
   standards for delivery and common definitions of services. DOD has developed JB Common
   Output Level Standards (JB-COLS) for Joint Basing implementation. These JB-COLS
   provide common output or performance level standards for installation support, establishing
   minimum functional support requirements, regardless of which Service provides the
   installation support.
   5.2.3. This chapter outlines an effective way to conduct Service-required inspections while
   keeping Service-Level readiness and compliance considerations intact. Ultimately, any
   inspection process, regardless of which Service provides installation support, must ensure
   unit and command responsibilities are met in the context of the newly established, fully
   operationally capable JB structures.
5.3. Definitions.
   5.3.1. The ―Supporting Component‖ is the component identified in BRAC 2005 as having
   installation support functions transferred to them from one or more supported components.
   The Supporting Component is responsible for providing installation support for the entire JB.
   For JBs with the AF serving as the lead service, all Active and Reserve AF units on the JB
   are considered part of the Supporting Component.
   5.3.2. The ―Supported Component‖ is a component identified in BRAC 2005 as transferring
   installation support functions to another component at a JB. For JBs with the AF serving as
   the lead service, all Active and Reserve Army, Navy, Marine Corps and other non-AF DOD
   units on the JB are considered Supported Components. On non-AF led JBs, all AF is part of
   the Supported Component, Active or Reserve.
   5.3.3. A "Tenant" is defined as all DOD agencies/activities, Guard units and all non-DOD
   entities on a JB. Working Capital Fund units not performing installation management
   functions are also classified as tenants.
   5.3.4. "Installation Support" is any of the twelve categories of services and support activities.
   These are identified in the Cost Performance Visibility Framework (CPVF) quarterly. JBs
   are resourced to provide installation support to the DOD developed JB-COLS performance
 76                                                AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013


   standards.   Examples include Command Support, Community Services, Emergency
   Management, Environmental, Facilities Investment, Facilities Operations, Housing, Human
   Resources Management, Information Technology Services Management, Logistics Services,
   Operational Mission Services and Security Services.
   5.3.5. JB-COLS are output or performance level standards established by the DOD for
   installation support using a common framework of definitions, outputs, output performance
   metrics, and cost drivers for each installation support function. These standards provide a
   description of the capability associated with the particular installation support function.
   These output levels will apply to all DOD Components, including DOD tenants, at JBs. A
   JB, through the Joint Management Oversight Structure (JMOS), can request a deviation from
   the output level. Only a senior-level DOD function, the Installations Capabilities Council
   (ICC), is authorized to approve deviations from JB-COLS.
   5.3.6. JB Implementation Guidance (JBIG).              The BRAC 2005 Joint Basing
   recommendations require detailed guidance to ensure that DOD implements
   recommendations in a way that expeditiously achieves the optimal level of long-term
   savings, while preserving or enhancing DOD’s warfighting capabilities. The JBIG, to
   include all supplemental guidance, directs DOD Components to implement joint basing
   under a common framework. It establishes the Joint Management Oversight Structure
   (JMOS) and confirms that all installation support will be transferred to the supporting
   Component to take full advantage of the efficiencies available from consolidation. Realizing
   the unique nature of our installations, the guidance establishes a governing framework to
   justify and approve variances to the guidance, ensures all Component equities are
   represented, and expeditiously resolves challenges to the fundamental improvement in the
   management of infrastructure resources.
   5.3.7. Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), in terms of JBIG, is the binding document for
   each JB that describes the organization structure, resourcing, output levels, dispute resolution
   and other agreements developed between the Components. Included in the MOA will be the
   JB Implementation Plan. The MOA, signed by the Component Vice Chiefs of Staff, defines
   the relationships between Components, and commits the supporting Component to delivery
   of the approved output levels.
   5.3.8. Inspectors must be aware that other support agreements are possible at the local level
   and fall under the following categories:
      5.3.8.1. Intra-Service agreements are AF to AF, to include AFRC and ANG.
      5.3.8.2. Inter-Service agreements are AF to other DOD Components.
      5.3.8.3. Intra-governmental agreements are AF to other non-DOD Federal activities.
      5.3.8.4. Agreements supporting AF to other non-Federal activities, excluding private or
      commercial enterprises.
5.4. Command Relationships.
   5.4.1. Base Organization and Installation Support (IS).
      5.4.1.1. A standing Joint Management Oversight Structure (JMOS) ensures fairness for
      the JB process by providing oversight of MOA compliance, dispute resolution, and
      equitable allocation of funding requirements to the responsible entities. The JMOS then
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                           77


     serves as a decision chain for JB-specific performance issues, and includes service
     installation management leaders and organizations at every echelon. A JB Partnership
     Council is the foundation of the JMOS with the following key roles: Review quarterly
     CPVF reports prior to submission to OSD and Service HQs and resolve IS delivery
     issues. It does not replicate routine JB decision processes or management functions.
     5.4.1.2. Air Base Wing (ABW)/Group (ABG) or AF Element responsibilities are
     organize, train and equip functions, and apply to Airmen assigned to JBs. Organize
     responsibilities include Command Authorities IAW UCMJ, DRRS, SORTS, AEF UTC
     Reporting Tool (ART), Individual Medical Readiness (IMR) Management, Backfill
     Management, and Military Personnel Management (Performance Reports/Decorations
     and      Functional/Quarterly    Awards).         Train   responsibilities   include
     Expeditionary/Readiness Training and Force Development (Training, Education). Equip
     responsibilities include Deployment/DOC Statement Equipment and Readiness Training
     Equipment.
     5.4.1.3. The JB Commander (JBC) has the authority and responsibility for effectively
     using available resources for planning, organizing, directing, coordinating, and
     controlling the delivery of installation support as detailed in the MOA. The JBC is
     synonymous with the AF term "installation commander," and the JBC exercises the
     authority traditionally associated with the installation commander on non-JB AF
     installations. Consequently, the JBC is the commander who has authority and control
     over JB real property and is responsible for directing installation management and
     support functions IAW the MOA and the established JB-COLS requirement.
        5.4.1.3.1. There may be instances in which the JBC's authority and the authority of
        other commanders on the installation are concurrent. All supporting component and
        supported commanders retain the inherent authority to provide for the health, morale
        and welfare of their assigned personnel and for the good order and discipline of their
        units. Commanders also retain Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) authority
        and administrative control (ADCON) over military personnel under their command
        (assigned Component), regardless of whether the military personnel are being
        operationally directed by the JBC. However, unlike other commanders on the
        installation, the authority of the JBC extends to the entire installation by virtue of his
        or her position as the installation commander.             A list of authorities and
        responsibilities assumed by the JBC are set out in the MOA and in paragraph 4.1.4
        of the DOD Supplemental Guidance for Implementing and Operating a Joint Base (as
        indicated, the list is illustrative and not exhaustive).
     5.4.1.4. Business Office (BO). BOs are part of some JB developmental solutions. As
     such, the BO consolidates responsibilities for agreement management, such as an Inter-
     Service Support Agreement (ISSA). The BO does not have responsibility for any roles
     customarily assigned to a traditional AF MSG or WSAs, but is the action office (or
     supporting office) for "other duties as assigned" that may include demographic data
     gathering, significant event calendar management, Economic Impact Assessment, and the
     Joint Land Use Study.
 78                                               AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013



5.5. COMPLIANCE INSPECTIONS.
   5.5.1. AF IGs will inspect Airmen using AF inspection requirements whether the AF is the
   supporting or supported Service at the JB. MAJCOM/IGs will inspect all Airmen, regardless
   of where they fall in the JB manning structure. When an AF supporting unit is providing
   service to an AF supported unit, the inspection standards applied stem from AFIs and their
   associated HAF Self Assessment Checklists (SAC). When an AF supporting unit is
   providing service to a supported unit from another service (Army, Navy, etc.), the inspection
   standards applied stem from JB COLs.
   5.5.2. Each JB has installation variances based on size, location, mission, etc., that make
   each compliance inspection unique. Additionally, MOAs between services, organizations,
   and entities are fluid, complicating the IG’s inspection planning efforts. In order to execute
   the most effective JB inspections across the spectrum of functional disciplines, a thorough
   inspection planning process is required. ARC units located at JBs will be notified of
   regularly scheduled inspections with a minimum one year notice.
   5.5.3. At JB locations where the AF is the supporting component, the Emergency
   Management (EM) program will be inspected IAW Attachment 3 of this Instruction. At JB
   locations where another Service is the supporting component, the owning MAJCOM will
   develop specific criteria for the lead active duty unit IAW the unit’s role (if any) in the
   installation emergency management program.
   5.5.4. Inspection Rating. Fundamentally, the AF portion of the inspection remains
   unchanged—the IG will inspect any Airman, AF process or function. The IG will inspect
   and rate each distinct unit IAW the IG’s sampling strategy. For example, at JB Lewis-
   McChord (JBLM), the 627th Air Base Group will receive a rating and the 62nd Airlift Wing
   will receive a separate and distinct rating. At JB McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JBMDL), the 87th
   Air Base Wing will receive a unique rating, as will the 305th Air Mobility Wing, and the
   621st Contingency Response Wing.
   5.5.5. Any non-AF issues uncovered during the inspection that affect AF unit compliance
   will be addressed in the report and passed to SAF/IGI for resolution. SAF/IGI will work
   with the other Service IG(s) and the Intermediate Command Summit (ICS) to resolve the
   issue. The final AF report may provide a comprehensive assessment on how the other
   Service’s installation support impacts the AF mission, but it will not deliver a rating to the
   other Services.
5.6. Responsibilities.
   5.6.1. SAF/IGI. Deficiencies that negatively impact AF processes, equipment and/or
   personnel, but are not "owned" by the AF through delegation of installation support
   leadership, will be the responsibility of SAF/IGI for resolution once up-channeled by the
   MAJCOM/IG Team Chief in the IG report.
   5.6.2. MAJCOM/IG Team Chief.
       5.6.2.1. The Team Chief is responsible for final approval of the JB inspection plan.
       5.6.2.2. For deficiencies that negatively impact AF processes, equipment and/or
       personnel, but are not "owned" by the AF, the AF IG Team Chief annotates the issue(s)
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                      79


       in the AF inspection report. Additionally, the Team Chief will debrief the issue(s) to
       senior AF leadership at the inspected unit, as well as the senior supporting component
       leadership at the inspected installation. The MAJCOM/IG Team Chief will then forward
       the issue requiring resolution to AFIA (this process is similar to a write-up against
       another HHQ). AFIA will work with SAF/IGI to resolve the issue.
5.7. Future State. SAF/IGI will coordinate with other Service IGs to establish a joint
inspection schedule. This will maximize calendar efficiencies for the JBs and provide a more
positive, interactive and authoritative inspection.

                                           Chapter 6

                  COMMANDERS’ INSPECTION RESPONSIBILITIES

6.1. General Information. IAW 10 USC § 8583, commanders at every level have a duty to
inspect the conduct of all persons placed under their command. Commanders will inspect to
improve unit performance, military discipline, readiness, efficiency, effectiveness and quality of
life for their Airmen.

Figure 6.1. Key Questions for CCs.




6.2. Sources of Inspection Data. Inspections evaluate unit performance in relation to
established standards of readiness, compliance, and surety. The integration and analysis of
multiple sources of inspection data can provide commanders a comprehensive look at unit
performance. These sources may include, but are not limited to:
   6.2.1. Status reports (e.g., SORTS/DRRS).
   6.2.2. Wing Quality Assurance (QA) programs.
   6.2.3. Wing Standardization/Evaluation.
   6.2.4. Exercise and Evaluation Team (EET). Exercises are a valuable source of evaluation
   for a commander in determining the unit’s ability to meet mission requirements. Exercises
   provide essential feedback for a commander.
   6.2.5. Individual Medical Readiness (IMR) unit reports.
   6.2.6. PRP status meeting minutes.
   6.2.7. Personal Observations.
   6.2.8. Climate Surveys.
   6.2.9. Civil Engineer Readiness Assessments and Reports.
   6.2.10. Self-Assessment Program. Self-assessment provides commanders with a tool for
   internal assessment of unit health and complements external assessments. MAJCOMs will
   ensure self-assessment programs are established for subordinate organizations. DRUs and
   FOAs will develop and implement self-assessment programs that align with HAF intent and
   function in similar fashion as wing programs described in this Instruction.
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                         81


       6.2.10.1. Commanders will appoint a Self-Assessment Program Manager at the Wing,
       Group and Squadron level. The monitor will utilize MICT to record self-assessments.
       Units will use HAF self-assessment checklists (SACs) and Deficiency Cause Codes listed
       in Attachment 7, when conducting self-assessments. Medical Quality Assurance and
       HIPAA data will not be entered into MICT unless/until MICT is certified for this data.
       FOUO, PII and classified information will not be entered into MICT.
           6.2.10.1.1. Commanders will supplement this guidance to define the roles of Group,
           Squadron and Flight Self-Assessment Program Managers.
       6.2.10.2. Problem-solving responsibility and the corrective action process reside at the
       lowest appropriate command level. Problem-solving will be applied using appropriate
       root cause analysis tools, such as the AF 8-Step Problem Solving Model as outlined in the
       AF Smart Operations for the 21st Century (AFSO21) playbook.
6.3. Responsibilities.
   6.3.1. MAJCOM/IG will:
       6.3.1.1. Inspect for compliance with 10 USC § 8583 and this Instruction.
       6.3.1.2. Work with MAJCOM/DRU/FOA leadership to identify a MICT program
       manager to assist Wings in MICT implementation, verify FAM checklist standardization.
   6.3.2. HAF/MAJCOM/NGB/DRU/FOA FAM will:
       6.3.2.1. Monitor and assess MICT data from wings to maintain situational awareness of
       potential problem areas.
       6.3.2.2. Employ AFSO21 tools for large-scale corrective actions. AFSO21 tools can be
       found in the AFSO21 playbook or on the AFSO21 AF Portal website:
       https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
       af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s6925EC13515C0FB5E044080020E329A
       9.
       6.3.2.3. Perform periodic reviews of AF Best Practices, MAJCOM Benchmarks,
       Continuous Process Improvement Management Tool (CPI-MT) and Joint Lessons
       Learned Information System (JLLIS) to identify and employ Enterprise or MAJCOM
       standards when appropriate.
       6.3.2.4. HAF Functionals will develop and publish in MICT a SAC with the unit-level
       compliance requirements for each AFI or AFI-mandated program. HAF Functionals may
       integrate the requirements from more than one AFI or AFI-directed program into a single
       SAC. MAJCOM/DRU/FOA FAMs will supplement HAF SACs when supplements to
       HAF guidance drive compliance by the unit. Unit Commanders may supplement
       MAJCOM supplements. SACs will be approved by the next higher HQ FAM (HAF
       approves MAJCOM, MAJCOM approves Wing, etc.). In addition, HAF and MAJCOM
       SACs will be coordinated through NGB (if applicable).
           6.3.2.4.1. Where there is no HAF SAC for specialized MAJCOM/DRU/FOA
           functions,   MAJCOM/DRU/FOA      FAMs   may     develop  and maintain
           MAJCOM/DRU/FOA-specific SACs.
82                                             AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013


        6.3.2.4.2. All SACs will indicate the degree of criticality for each self-assessment
        item (Tier 1, 2 or 3 below). All HAF Functionals will update affected SACs within
        90 days of guidance changes being posted on the AF e-Publishing website. HAF
        Functionals will review each of their SAC annually: HAF SAC review/updates will
        be conducted NLT 31 Jan with MAJCOM supplement review/updates conducted
        NLT 31 Mar; see Attachment 6 for SAC template and website information.
            6.3.2.4.2.1. SAC Timelines. HAF directorates will comply with the following
            timelines:
               6.3.2.4.2.1.1. Load SAC for each AFI, AFI-mandated program or supplement
               requiring unit compliance into the MICT database; the initial input should
               occur NLT 31 Jul 12 and annual SAC review/update will occur in accordance
               with paragraph 6.3.2.4.2
               6.3.2.4.2.1.2. For each change to an AFI, AFI-mandated program or
               supplement requiring unit compliance, load updated SAC into the MICT
               database NLT 90 days of the publication effective date.
                 6.3.2.4.2.1.2.1. (Added-AFSPC) Checklist Functionals will follow HQ
                 AFSPC/IG business rules for loading checklists into the MICT database.
        6.3.2.4.3. Degrees of Criticality for SACs:
            6.3.2.4.3.1. Tier 1: Non-compliance puts Airmen, commanders, or the USAF at
            risk of mission or program failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable waste.
            6.3.2.4.3.2. Tier 2: Non-compliance degrades mission or program effectiveness
            or efficiency, and has potential, if not corrected, to create risk of mission or
            program failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable waste.
            6.3.2.4.3.3. Tier 3: Non-compliance limits mission or program effectiveness or
            efficiency.
  6.3.3. The Wing Commander:
     6.3.3.1. Will establish and maintain a Self-Assessment Program IAW this AFI and chain
     of command guidance.
     6.3.3.2. Will establish a frequency for the Self-Assessment Program to enable adequate
     awareness by the command chain of the wing’s readiness, compliance and surety.
     6.3.3.3. Will ensure subordinate organizations (i.e., Group, Squadron) establish and
     maintain a Self-Assessment Program that supports the Wing Self-Assessment Program.
     6.3.3.4. Will designate a Wing Self-Assessment Program Manager
     6.3.3.5. Will designate a Wing MICT Lead Manager.
        6.3.3.5.1. (Added-AFSPC) Submit Wing Self-Assessment Program Manager and
        MICT Lead Manager appointment letters to igx.workflow@us.af.mil. Wing Self-
        Assessment Program Manager and Wing MICT Lead Manager may be the same
        person.
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                       83


  6.3.4. The Wing Self-Assessment Program Manager will:
     6.3.4.1. Facilitate compliance with this AFI.
     6.3.4.2. Develop, manage and maintain the Wing Self-Assessment Program
     6.3.4.3. Provide guidance for subordinate organizations (Group, Squadron, other Staff

     6.3.5.1. Act as the Wing’s liaison with the MAJCOM MICT Lead Manager.
     6.3.5.2. Act as the overall member management and permission granting authority for
     the Wing and all subordinate units.
     6.3.5.3. Identify Wing’s MICT administrators at all levels (wing, group, and squadron).
     6.3.5.4. Provide periodic MICT training for commanders, unit administrators and
     checklist assessors.
     6.3.5.5. Identify and consolidate software issues and suggestions for future software
     improvements to be forwarded to the MAJCOM MICT Lead Manager.
     6.3.5.6. Develop MICT guidance (―business rules‖) for subordinate organizations
     (group, squadron, other Staff agencies) for MICT data entry.
     6.3.5.7. Utilize MICT to develop appropriate reporting tools to meet the needs of wing
     leadership.
  6.3.6. (Added-AFSPC) Commanders/Directors of NAFs, Centers and units that do not fall
  under an HQ AFSPC wing will:
     6.3.6.1. (Added-AFSPC) Assume wing              commander     Self-Assessment   Program
     responsibilities as outlined in para 6.3.3.

       6.3.6.2. (Added-AFSPC) Submit unit Self-Assessment Program Manager and MICT
       Lead Manager appointment letters to afspc.mict.wf@us.af.mil. The unit Self-
       Assessment Program Manager and unit MICT Lead Manager may be the same person.
   6.3.7. (Added-AFSPC) When an HQ AFSPC ARC unit does not fall under an HQ AFSPC
   wing, the unit will follow ARC Self-Assessment Program guidelines.
6.4. Future State:
   6.4.1. In Nov 2011, CSAF directed SAF/IG and COMUSAFE to develop and implement a
   new inspection system across USAFE, for possible AF-wide implementation at a later date.
   The guidance for this new system is contained in a separate Guidance Memorandum and is
   for USAFE only. The USAFE system will give wing commanders manpower, training and
   guidance to create an organic inspection capability. As this wing-level inspection capability
   is developed into a mature, trusted component of the AF Inspection System, MAJCOM/IGs
   will increasingly shift their focus away from Compliance Inspections to Unit Effectiveness
   Inspections (UEI), validating and verifying the wing’s own ability to find, fix, report and
   track deficiencies to closure.

assessments and support to improve readiness, discipline and efficiency, to include: oversight of
NSIs; process improvement facilitation and support for AFSO21 initiatives; conducts inspections
of DRUs and FOAs; and conducts AF HSIs. (see paragraph 1.5.3).
7.2. Management Inspection (MI). An MI is an inspection above wing level that assesses the
efficiency, effectiveness, economy, and discipline of organizations, activities, or programs based
on the fundamental principles of well-managed organizations. An MI uses a five-tier rating
system that measures the seven major graded areas discussed below.
   7.2.1. Execution. MIs are conducted to assess areas mandated by law as well as
   management functions above the wing level against the fundamental principles of well-
   managed organizations.
   7.2.2. MI Rating. Overall management performance and management MGAs will be rated
   using the five-tier scale OUTSTANDING, EXCELLENT, SATISFACTORY, MARGINAL,
   and UNSATISFACTORY. This tier system will be the same whether inspecting an
   organization, agency, FOA, DRU or an AF-level program.
   7.2.3. AF Management Inspection MGAs.

          7.2.3.7.3. Assess the organization’s outcomes to ensure they satisfy their own
          strategic goals/objectives.
          7.2.3.7.4. Assess if the organization is functioning within its authority, doing work
          outside its scope, duplicating a role of another organization or section internal to itself
          and if the work could be more efficiently accomplished by another organization.
7.3. Nuclear Surety Inspection (NSI).
   7.3.1. AF NSI Core Team (AFIA/TIN). A core team of certified NSI inspectors centralized
   at AFIA will integrate with the MAJCOM/IG Teams on all scheduled and no-notice NSIs
   used to operationally certify and verify nuclear-capable units. The Core Team will also
   support NSI re-inspections and select LNSIs and INSIs. See paragraph 4.14
      7.3.1.1. The Core Team provides expertise across various nuclear surety MGAs as
      outlined in Chapter 4. The Core Team will support NSIs across the nuclear-capable
      MAJCOMs (AFGSC, AFMC, AMC and USAFE).
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                           87


     7.3.1.2. The Core Team will combine with the MAJCOM/IG Team to form a single unit,
     under the direction of the MAJCOM/IG Team Chief. The MAJCOM/IG Team Chief
     retains the authority as the on-scene director and is responsible for determining the
     inspection grade and completing the inspection report to the MAJCOM/CC. The Core
     Team will provide the Deputy Team Chief.
     7.3.1.3. Primary objectives of the Core Team are to improve standardization of NSIs,
     elevate the MAJCOM/IG Team’s inspector experience and expertise and contribute to
     NSI lessons learned and trend analysis processes. Additionally, Core Team members will
     support the semi-annual NSI process review, the NSI inspector training and certification
     program, applicable conferences and meetings held throughout the nuclear enterprise,
     and/or duties assigned by AFIA/CC.
     7.3.1.4. The MAJCOM/IG Team Chief and the Deputy Team Chief from the Core Team
     are responsible for developing full team complement consisting of permanent party, Core
     Team members, and required SME augmentees.
  7.3.2. AF NSI Oversight Team.               AFIA/OV provides oversight assessments to
  MAJCOM/CCs and TIG on the consistency of MAJCOM NSIs. Conducts in-depth trend
  analysis, assesses the sufficiency of corrective actions to inspection deficiencies and provides
  deficiency status and metrics to personnel in the AF nuclear surety arena. See paragraph
  4.15
     7.3.2.1. The Oversight Team will not perform inspections but has the authority to
     intervene in an inspection for reasons of safety or critical non-compliance.
     7.3.2.2. Acts as the AF clearinghouse for MAJCOM responses to DTRA Nuclear
     Weapon Technical Inspection deficiencies.         AFIA/OV reviews CRITICAL and
     SIGNIFICANT nuclear surety deficiencies identified in DTRA inspection reports and
     requests clarification of deficiencies. AFIA/OV also reviews MAJCOM actions taken to
     correct these deficiencies and endorses them to DTRA. In cases where AFIA or DTRA
     non-concurs, AFIA/OV returns corrective action responses to MAJCOM for clarification.
     Seeks consultative assistance from AFSC/SEW as needed.
     7.3.2.3. Provides nuclear surety-related oversight of MAJCOM-conducted NSIs, LNSIs
     and select INSIs, to include re-inspections and no-/minimal-notice NSIs and LNSIs.
     Additionally, provides observer(s) when the Defense Threat Reduction
     Agency/Committee on the Safety of Nuclear Installations (DTRA/CSNI) inspects AF
     units under the auspices of CJCSI 3263.05. AFIA will coordinate each NSI visit with the
     respective MAJCOM/IG Gatekeeper and will honor the IG trusted agent system to
     protect the minimum or no-notice aspect of the inspection. In the course of directly
     observing MAJCOM inspectors conducting their activities, AFIA/OV team members will
     not intervene in the inspection process unless the safety, security, or reliability of a
     weapon is in jeopardy, or injury to personnel, and the MAJCOM inspectors fail to take
     appropriate actions to correct the situation.
         7.3.2.3.1. Upon inspection conclusion, the AFIA Oversight Team Chief will provide
         a separate non-collaborative report, routed through AFIA/CC and TIG to SECAF,
         MAJCOM/CC and MAJCOM/IG. The report provides an assessment of the
         MAJCOM/IG team and their conduct of the inspection, and an independent
88                                              AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013


        perspective of the inspected unit's nuclear surety. Specific areas to be addressed in
        each report include:
            7.3.2.3.1.1. Concurrence or non-concurrence with the MAJCOM/IG assessment
            of nuclear surety.
            7.3.2.3.1.2. Contentious issues (include areas requiring level 1 or 2 adjudication,
            reference paragraph 4.16).
            7.3.2.3.1.3. Composition of the qualification and training of MAJCOM
            inspection team.
            7.3.2.3.1.4. Use of current AF and MAJCOM checklists and inspection guides as
            per paragraph 1.5.7.4
            7.3.2.3.1.5. Implementation and understanding of policy and guidance.
            7.3.2.3.1.6. Adequacy of MAJCOM/IG validation.
            7.3.2.3.1.7. Sufficiency of MAJCOM/IG report.
            7.3.2.3.1.8. Sufficiency of MAJCOM/IG team’s deliberative process.
     7.3.2.4. Coordinates the proposed DTRA NSI inspection schedule for AF units.
     7.3.2.5. AFIA Inspection Observations. AFIA will observe MAJCOM/IG teams
     conducting inspections (all types) and provide feedback to the MAJCOM/IGs and
     SAF/IG. Feedback is derived from over-the-shoulder observation of inspection planning
     (when able), and execution focusing on the quality, standardization, objectivity,
     thoroughness and conduct of the MAJCOM/IG team.
        7.3.2.5.1. Inspection observations will be administered by AFIA/OV and should be
        no-notice. AFIA/OV will selectively determine which inspections to observe with the
        goal of providing each MAJCOM/IG feedback across the spectrum of inspection
        activity over a 24-month period.
            7.3.2.5.1.1. Observation teams should have a minimal footprint and be
            nonintrusive into the MAJCOM inspection process unless safety or security are
            jeopardized.
            7.3.2.5.1.2. AFIA Oversight Team Chief will brief the MAJCOM/IG Team Chief
            of the AFIA role in the inspection process during the inspection inbrief.
            7.3.2.5.1.3. AFIA Observation members should be present at the MAJCOM/IG’s
            daily team meeting/event recap unless actively observing MAJCOM/IG
            inspectors.
            7.3.2.5.1.4. AFIA Observation Team Chief (or representative) should be present
            at all MAJCOM/IG Team Chief briefs and meetings with the Unit Commander.
            7.3.2.5.1.5. The MAJCOM/IG Team Chief will provide the AFIA Observation
            Team Chief a draft copy of their inspection report prior to the unit outbrief.
        7.3.2.5.2. AFIA/OV will provide an observation report for each observed inspection
        within 30 days of the inspection outbrief. The report will be approved by the
        AFIA/CC and provided to SAF/IG and MAJCOM/IG. The report will provide
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                          89


           feedback on the MAJCOM/IG team planning and performance in the conduct of the
           inspection. The report will not contain AFIA’s assessment of the inspected unit’s
           compliance with policy or readiness posture, but may comment on AFIA observations
           related to significant unit non-compliance with policy or readiness deficiencies that
           the MAJCOM/IG team does not identify or address.
7.4. DRU and FOA CIs. AFIA/TIC conducts CUIs of the Air Force District of Washington
and the United States Air Force Academy IAW Chapters 1, 2 and 3. However, AFIA/TIC
conducts CIs only for all the other AF-level DRUs and FOAs IAW Chapters 1 and 2 and the
paragraphs below.
   7.4.1. Inspection Scope. These inspections will be conducted on either a scheduled or a no-
   notice basis at an interval of no more than 24 months. SAF/IG approval is required to exceed
   the 24-month inspection interval. All applicable areas from Attachment 3 (CUI Ph 0
   column) will be inspected at each unit, grouped into appropriate MGAs. Inspected units may
   rely on host wing support for management of some programs. Since the host wings are
   subject to inspection by their own MAJCOM, AFIA will not inspect the host; however, AFIA
   will assess the adequacy of host wing support to the inspected unit. On the other hand, if
   program support is provided by a FOA’s parent organization, the program management by
   the parent is subject to inspection by AFIA.
   7.4.2. Reports and Follow-up. Official reports will be published on the final day of the
   inspection, directly following the commander’s outbrief.
   7.4.3. CI Re-inspection. Units receiving an overall rating of UNSATISFACTORY during a
   CI will be scheduled for a re-inspection within 6 months. SAF/IG approval is required to
   exceed the 6-month re-inspection interval. Only MGAs receiving a MARGINAL or
   UNSATISFACTORY will be re-inspected.
7.5. HSI. HSIs assess the functioning and execution of AF Medical Service (AFMS) programs
and processes at the local level in order to provide senior leadership with accurate data upon
which to base policy decisions. HSIs also assess the ability of AF medical units to fulfill their
health service support missions by providing required capability, including provision of medical
care, success in training and equipping deployable personnel, and support of the host wing
mission.
   7.5.1. Criteria and Inspection Guides. HQ AFIA/SG, in collaboration with HAF, AFMSA
   and AFMOA functional SMEs, derives criteria from health care policies of the Office of the
   Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs (SAF/IE), the office of the AF/SG,
   MAJCOM SG, OSHA public Law, various civilian medical oversight agencies [such as the
   Joint Commission and the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care
   (AAAHC)], the NGB, and the AFRC. Air Force Inspection Agency, Medical Operations
   Directorate (AFIA/SG), based on changes in health care policies, regulatory guidance and
   coordination with AF/SG, NGB/SG and AFRC/SG staffs, annually updates the next year’s
   inspection guide and posts to the AFIA SharePoint site. Inspectors assess sustained
   performance by reviewing substantiating documents created since the last inspection.
       7.5.1.1. Certification.   Comply with applicable portions of paragraph 2.4.1 and its
       subparagraphs.
90                                              AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013


  7.5.2. Ratings. Each medical unit receives an overall rating of OUTSTANDING,
  EXCELLENT, SATISFACTORY, MARGINAL, or UNSATISFACTORY.
  7.5.3. HSI Frequency. HSIs will occur with CUIs (see Chapter 3).
     7.5.3.1. AD medical units update their demographics whenever they become aware of an
     event that may affect the scheduling process. AD bedded medical units must update their
     electronic Joint Commission application upon notification from The Joint Commission,
     which occurs 15 months prior to their anniversary date. Significant changes should be
     reported to the Joint Commission within 30 days of change. The Joint Commission also
     requires an annual self-assessment Periodic Performance Review (PPR) via electronic
     submission. Notification for e-application and PPR submission requirements are
     provided per email to the Military Treatment Facility (MTF) CC 15 months prior to the
     accreditation anniversary date. AD non-bedded medical units must submit a new
     application with AAAHC which must be received no later than 90 days prior to their
     reaccreditation survey date. During the term of accreditation, AAAHC also requires
     written notification within 30 days of any significant organizational, operational or
     financial changes that can occur.
         7.5.3.1.1. MAJCOM IGs contact the AFIA Gatekeeper for HSI scheduling concerns
         according to MAJCOM-specific notification procedures.
         7.5.3.1.2. MTFs requesting postponement/re-schedule of a scheduled AD inspection
         must be forwarded to AFIA/SG for approval following Wing CC (or equivalent),
         MAJCOM/IG, MAJCOM SG coordination and AF/SG concurrence. MTFs should
         allow sufficient time to process and coordinate postponement requests ensuring
         AFIA/SG has appropriate information to make a decision to approve/disapprove the
         request.
     7.5.3.2. ARC units are inspected on average every 48 months not to exceed 60-months
     from the date of the last HSI. AFIA/SG publishes a calendar year ARC HSI schedule in
     coordination with AFRC/IG/SG and NGB/IG/SG. In keeping with AF policy regarding
     inspection footprint, AFIA/SG will, to the greatest extent possible, schedule medical unit
     HSIs simultaneously with other scheduled wing inspections and assessments (e.g., CI,
     ASEV). Unit requests for postponement/re-schedule of a scheduled ARC or AES HSI
     must be forwarded to AFIA/SG following MAJCOM coordination and policies. Units
     should allow sufficient time to process and coordinate postponement requests ensuring
     AFIA/SG has the time and appropriate information to make a decision to
     approve/disapprove the request. ANG Medical Groups are the medical force provider for
     CBRNE Enhanced Response Force Packages (CERFP). These medical elements have a
     separate, joint mission within their state and may not drill with or participate in MDG
     activities. CERFP training requirements are delineated in AFI 41-106. Host MDG is
     responsible for maintain credentials and training documentation. Otherwise, the CERFP
     Medical element should be considered a separate entity for HSI purposes. Note: For
     purposes of this Instruction, NGB/SG is a MAJCOM equivalent.
     7.5.3.3. Certain events or circumstances may affect inspection scheduling for AD and
     ARC units. Follow the guidance listed in Chapter 3 of this Instruction.
     7.5.3.4. Follow-up inspections.
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                          91


          7.5.3.4.1. All units receiving an overall rating of ―Unsatisfactory‖ or ―Marginal‖
          during an HSI will be scheduled for a re-inspection within 18 months or for ARC
          units not to exceed 24 months. The unit’s rating for a re-inspection will be capped at
          a ―SATISFACTORY‖ rating.
              7.5.3.4.1.1. The MAJCOM SG or equivalent will conduct a staff assistance visit
              within six months to assess status. This report will be forwarded to AFIA/SG.
          7.5.3.4.2. For ARC and ARC AE units, the next scheduled HSI will be conducted in
          conjunction with the next scheduled CUI not to exceed 60 months from the date of
          the initial unsatisfactory/marginal HSI.
   7.5.4. Reports and Follow-up Responses. An electronic and/or paper copy HSI report will
   be included in the overall IG report and left with the unit CC at the conclusion of the
   inspection. A final copy is distributed to AF/SG, MAJCOM/SG, SAF/IGI and other
   interested staff agencies after review at AFIA.
       7.5.4.1. ―Critical‖ and ―Programmatic Failure‖ (Scores of 0 and 1) assessments for all
       units require a response (close-out or interim update) within 3 months of the inspection.
       These assessments are expected to be completely resolved within 12 months. Units are
       required to provide follow-up replies, including estimated completion dates, every 90
       days until closure to their respective MAJCOM/SGs (or equivalent) IAW instructions
       outlined in the HSI final report.
       7.5.4.2. ―Critical‖ and ―Programmatic Failure‖ (Scores of 0 and 1) assessments for ARC
       units and AESs require a response (close-out or interim update) within 6 months of the
       inspection. Units are required to provide follow-up replies, including estimated
       completion dates, every 3 months until closure to their respective MAJCOM/SGs IAW
       instructions outlined in the HSI final report. These assessments are expected to be
       completely resolved within 12 months.
       7.5.4.3. MTF or ARC medical units or AE Squadrons with assessments of "CRITICAL"
       or "Programmatic Failure" (Scores of 1 or 0) in any element, or assessments of "MAJOR"
       (Score of 2) in any element that is a repeat deficiency from the previous HSI will conduct
       AF 8-Step Problem Solving as outlined in the AFSO21 Playbook, determining root-
       causes and countermeasures to deficiencies. AF 8-Step Problem Solving documentation
       (preferably in AFSO21 A3 template) will be forwarded within 90 days for Active-Duty
       units and 6 months for ARC units and AESs to their respective MAJCOM/SGs (or
       equivalent), who will track and provide follow-up guidance until resolution. Once
       resolved, informational copies of the problem solving documentation will also be sent by
       units to AFIA/SG.
   7.5.5. Special Emphasis Items (SEI). SEIs are limited studies performed during HSIs whose
   purpose is to gather information on specific issues. Topics to be researched are submitted by
   field or HQ personnel to AFIA/SG for approval/disapproval. SEIs are normally terminated
   within 6-12 months, and the results are briefed at the annual IG-SG Annual Review. There
   should be no more than 3 active SEIs at one time.
7.6. Field Inspection. As applicable, these inspections provide SAF/IG credible, independent
assessments of AF operational readiness, efficiency, discipline, morale, economy, and
effectiveness, as well as assist in oversight of the AF inspection system.

   7.6.1. IG Team Augmentation. On request, AFIA inspectors may augment MAJCOM/IG
   teams during inspections of field units. AFIA augmentees do not write a separate report.
   Rated inspectors with current medical and physiological training prerequisites may fly as
   observers in unit aircraft when appropriate to their inspection role.
   7.6.2. Contingencies and Combat. AFIA inspectors may deploy to forward locations and
   field HQs during contingency and/or combat operations to observe processes and recommend
   solutions to readiness problems beyond the control of the local AF field commander. These
   visits require approval by the appropriate unified command. This is not an inspection, but is
   an opportunity for an independent and impartial AF-level team to analyze systemic readiness
   problems that may need HAF or higher-level attention. Refer also to War Mobilization Plan,
   Volume 1, Annex O.
7.7. Inspector General Directed Investigation (IGDI). An IGDI is a high-priority
investigation directed by TIG. These investigations are usually time sensitive and deficiencies
and recommendations are of significant interest to the AF, members of Congress, or the general
public. TIG approves all requests for IGDIs.
7.8. The AFIA MI and Analysis Division. Will collect, monitor, analyze and report on key
inspection data from across the USAF and compile the data into meaningful information to
support Air Force Senior Leader decision making.
   7.8.1. Support SAF/IG with analysis for SECAF/CSAF level briefings.
   7.8.2. Provide AF wide inspection analysis for Air Force Enterprise Dashboard.
   7.8.3. Collect Root Cause Analysis (RCA) data from the MAJCOMS for analysis.
   7.8.4. Report on inspection trends to SAF/IG and other Senior leaders across the Air Force.
7.9. TIGIRS Lead Command. Acts as Lead Command for all components of the TIGIRS
family of systems. At this time those components are IGEMS, MICT and AFICS.
   7.9.1. Develops, validates, prioritizes and documents all requirements for each component.
   Provides all requirements to the TIGIRS Program Office (AFPEO EIS/HIBI).
   7.9.2. Monitors the activities of the TIGIRS Program Office to modify, sustain and support
   each component.
   7.9.3. Acts as the single voice of the customer to communicate and represent user issues and
   concerns to the TIGIRS Program Office.
   7.9.4. Directs the operational testing of upgrades to each TIGIRS component.
   7.9.5. Manages the TIGIRS program, to include reporting status to AFIA/PI, AFIA/CC and
   SAF/IG; identifying and resolving program issues; and identifying and programming for the
   resources required to support the upgrade and sustainment of each component.
7.10. TIG Brief Magazine. AFIA publishes TIG Brief (Air Force Recurring Publication
[AFRP] 90-1) which provides authoritative guidance and information to CCs, IGs, inspectors,
and AF supervisors and leaders at all levels of command. Anyone may submit articles to
AFIA/PI. Articles should relate to anticipated or actual problems, recommendations to improve
management, safety, security, inspection or operational techniques, cross tell of lessons learned,
best practices, or contemporary issues of interest to the AF.

                   IG FORCE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT

8.1. Air Force Inspector General Duty. IG duty is a position of high public trust. Personnel
selected for an Air Force Inspector General assignment are functional experts selected from Air
Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) across the Air Force. They possess attributes of the highest
professional standards and moral character; demonstrate potential for future service and
continued promotion; and provide credibility for those Airmen, family members, and civilians
who seek IG assistance. In addition to these qualities, Airmen selected for IG service will:

   Course at the Pentagon within 60 days of being appointed. MAJCOM/IG Deputies and
   MAJCOM/IG Superintendents may attend at the discretion of the MAJCOM/IG.
   MAJCOM/IGs, Other IG senior officers, civilian equivalents and senior NCOs must be
   nominated by their MAJCOM/IG in order to attend on a space-available basis.
   MAJCOM/IGs will submit requests for training to SAF/IGI.
   8.4.2. Mandatory Training. All permanent party AFIA, MAJCOM and Wing Inspection
   IG team members will complete the USAF Basic Inspectors Course within 90 days (180 days
   for ARC) of assignment to an IG position. All permanent party AFIA, MAJCOM and Wing
   Inspection IG team members that complete NWTI will complete the USAF Nuclear
   Inspectors Course within 180 days of assignment to an IG team. Additionally, PRP medical
   inspectors are required to complete the AFMS Medical PRP Course within 180 calendar days
   after assuming inspector duties. MAJCOM/IG inspector augmentees will receive proper
   education and training equivalent to the mandatory inspector courses prior to assuming duties
   as an inspector augmentee. While designed and required for newly assigned MAJCOM/IG
   team members, other MAJCOM/unit-level inspectors and Wing Inspection Team (WIT)
   members may attend both courses on a space-available basis. Additional information
   regarding the Inspectors Course may be obtained from the AFIA SharePoint/Inspector
   Management Site; https://cs.eis.af.mil/afia/TI/default.aspx.
       8.4.2.1. AFIA/TII will post a yearly schedule in the SharePoint/Inspector Management
       Site NLT 1 Sep each year for the USAF Basic Inspector Course and Nuclear Surety
       Courses. For special circumstances (i.e., Mobile Training Team for either course) contact
       the TII Division Chief. AFIA inspector training can be found at the AFIA
       SharePoint/Inspector                            Management                          Site;
       https://cs.eis.af.mil/afia/TI/afiaic/Lists/Inspector%20Course%20Events/Active%20
       Courses.aspx
       8.4.2.2. AFIA Instructors will train and certify designated MAJCOM/IG inspectors to
       teach the Air Force Basic Inspectors' Course. MAJCOM/IG instructors will administer
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                           95


     the Air Force Basic Inspectors' Course to Wing/IG team members. AFIA will perform
     periodic audits of MAJCOM/IG training as required. To ensure currency and
     standardization in training, AFIA will provide updated training materials to all
     MAJCOMs (as required); certified MAJCOM/IG instructors are responsible for ensuring
     they are using current training materials.
     8.4.2.3. MAJCOM/IG Instructors may utilize a video-teleconferencing or Direct Connect
     Online (DCO) means to conduct Basic Inspectors Course training.
  8.4.3. MAJCOM/IG-Specific Training. MAJCOM/IGs will develop and provide all
  required specialized team, functional area, host-nation, or MAJCOM-specific training to
  augmentees as required.
  8.4.4. For required inspector training prior to assessing contractor functions, IG Team Chiefs
  will ensure inspectors complete training IAW the following guidance:
     8.4.4.1. Inspectors may receive Contracting Officer’s Representative training IAW
     AFFARS Mandatory Procedure 5301.602-2 (d), Designation, Assignment, and
     Responsibilities of a Contracting Officer’s Representative. MAJCOMs will document in
     their supplement to this AFI if additional contract-specific training is required. Additional
     on-line training shall consist of the following courses:
         8.4.4.1.1. Defense Acquisition University (DAU) CLC106, ―COR (Contracting
         Officer Representative) with a Mission Focus‖, available on-line at:
         https://www.atrrs.army.mil/channels/acqnow/default.asp?page=main.asp.
         8.4.4.1.2. DAU COR 206, COR in a Contingency Environment (when applicable),
         available                             on-line                           at:
         https://www.atrrs.army.mil/channels/acqnow/default.asp?page=main.asp.
         8.4.4.1.3. Continuous Learning Modules (CLM) 003, Ethics Training For
         Acquisition     Technology    and     Logistics,   available  on-line at:
         https://www.atrrs.army.mil/channels/acqnow/default.asp?page=main.asp.
         8.4.4.1.4. Inspectors performing EMS audits must successfully complete EMS Lead
         Auditor training. This training can be satisfied through AFIT's WENV 350
         Environmental Management Systems Auditing Course or from commercially offered
         US Registration Advisory Board (RAB) certified ISO 14001 lead auditor training
         courses.
     8.4.4.2. The ESOHCAMP inspectors should be qualified in their respective areas of
     expertise. A MAJCOM or FOA member of the Safety Office will be considered
     qualified in their respective areas. The Environmental programs will be evaluated by a
     MAJCOM or FOA member of the Environmental Function who also has completed
     Environmental management Systems auditor training. Occupational health programs will
     be evaluated by either a certified industrial hygienist or fully qualified Bioenvironmental
     Engineer (43E3). If base level personnel are used to support an inspection they must be
     approved by the MAJCOM Safety, Surgeon or Civil Engineering office respectively in
     addition to the above AFSC and training requirements.
  8.4.5. Recurring Training. All AF inspectors will accomplish mandatory refresher training
  every 48 months after certification, to include, AFIA, MAJCOM/IG, and Wing/IG inspectors
 96                                                  AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013


   and those inspector augmentees who augment AFIA and MAJCOM/IG and Wing IG teams.
   Those inspectors who do not inspect on a regular basis (i.e., at least two inspections annually,
   not including field observation training) will re-accomplish the basic inspector course.
   MAJCOM/IGs may provide refresher training with an AFIA-approved course. Recurring
   training does not require field observation by a certified inspector.
   8.4.6. Optional Training. NSI Inspectors are highly encouraged to attend other nuclear
   and/or inspection courses to add breadth and depth to their nuclear experience.
8.5. Inspector General Certification. See paragraph 2.4.1 and its sub-paragraphs.
8.6. Civilian Inspector General Requirements. In accordance with civilian personnel rules
and regulations, commanders or command IGs may hire Air Force civilians to serve as IG
personnel. Hiring authorities must ensure that these employees, like their uniformed
counterparts, understand the nature of IG work. MAJCOM/IGs must understand that civilian
employees who perform IG duties have access to sensitive and confidential IG information and
hold a position of high public trust. To protect those who seek assistance from the IG and to
safeguard the integrity of the IG system, civilian employees performing IG duties must display
moral attributes and personal traits that demonstrate adherence to Air Force Core Values.
   8.6.1. During the hiring process, hiring authorities will screen potential civilian employee
   candidates, to include current IGs applying for another IG position. These elements will be
   incorporated into hiring announcements and civilian position descriptions. Failure to
   maintain attributes in paragraphs 8.6.2.4, 8.6.2.5 and 8.6.2.6 below will serve as grounds for
   revocation of IG certification, credentials, and possibly termination from government service.
   8.6.2. Civilians selected for Inspector General Inspections duty will:
       8.6.2.1. Be a citizen of the United States.
       8.6.2.2. Be in the grade of GS–11 or above. Team Chiefs will be in the grade of GS-13
       or above.
       8.6.2.3. Have broad, contemporary Air Force experience and background that reflects
       outstanding performance. Civilian NSI inspectors must have prior nuclear experience.
       Civilians inspecting technical operations will also be required to have a nuclear munitions
       background. This experience is crucial to gain and maintain credibility with Airmen and
       civilians when conducting IG functions.
       8.6.2.4. Display moral attributes and personal traits that demonstrate adherence to Air
       Force Core Values.
       8.6.2.5. Be able to attain and hold a security clearance commensurate with the duties
       required as an IG inspector.
       8.6.2.6. Have no record of civil conviction except for minor offenses.
8.7. Future State.
   8.7.1. 1 Wear of Inspector General Insignia. This policy is under development and awaiting
   approval by SECAF and CSAF.

           conduct unit JTAC S/E program inspections.
           Inspections consist of two parts, the
           Individual JTAC Evaluation Program and the
           Operational JTAC Evaluation.
           Items are evaluated for compliance and
           inspections conducted through audits and
           interviews with leadership and program
           managers. SEE Objectivity Evaluations are
           conducted through performance evaluations
           and previous evaluations are reviewed. For
           Operational JTAC Evaluations, written
           examinations are administered to 100% of
           available JTACs and 25% of total assigned
           JTACs are administered performance
           evaluations.

A4.4. AF NUCLEAR WEAPON SECURITY INSPECTION GUIDE
   A4.4.1. Utilization. The inspection areas and items in this guide identify minimum-security
   standards and capabilities outlined in DOD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108. When assessing
   whether a unit complies with applicable technical criteria, inspectors use this guide to
   identify areas/items to conduct performance test(s), compliance validation, or security
   exercises. Inspectors also use this guide during security exercises to assess how applicable
   areas/items contribute to a unit’s ability to meet the NWSS and provide effective response to
   emergencies. Inspectors will use the published Integrated Base Defense Security System
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                327

                                        Attachment 8
       WOUNDED, ILL, AND INJURED (WII) INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS

A8.1. Background. Congress, as part of the FY08 National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA), requires Inspectors General to inspect government-provided facilities that house
patients on medical hold. Section 1662, Access of Recovering Service Members to Adequate
Outpatient Residential Facilities, outlines the requirement for inspecting and reporting. In
September 2007, DOD issued standards for inspection of facilities for outpatient service
members. To ensure compliance with DOD standards, inspectors will use the checklist at the
end of this Attachment when performing the WII inspection.
A8.2. Notification of Inspection Requirement: SAF/IGI will receive a monthly listing of
recovering Air Force wounded warriors from AF/A1S; after informing TIG of current Air Force
wounded warrior inspection requirements, SAF/IGI will forward the list to AFIA for formal
inspection coordination. If an installation will be expecting a recovering wounded warrior to
reside in government-owned housing (base housing, on-base dorms, billeting), the MAJCOM/IG
will be personally notified by e-mail and/or phone by AFIA. The notification will include the
wounded warrior’s name, their Recovery Care Coordinator (RCC), the wounded warrior’s
prospective address (government-provided housing facility), and any other pertinent information
deemed necessary to facilitate the inspection coordination process.
A8.3. Frequency. The inspection requirement is to perform an annual inspection on the
government-owned housing facility for as long as the recovering Airman is in wounded warrior
status. The initial inspection should be performed during the next scheduled inspection at that
base where the recovering wounded warrior will reside (if that base is not due an inspection
within a year, then the MAJCOM/IG will perform the inspection as soon as possible).
Subsequent inspections will be accomplished annually thereafter, for as long as the recovering
Airman remains in a wounded warrior status.
A8.4. Pre-Occupancy Inspection. In addition to the scheduled WII inspection, MAJCOM/IGs
will instruct the wounded warrior’s commander to perform a pre-occupancy inspection of the
residence, to take place before the recovering wounded warrior takes occupancy (or as soon as
possible if notification from A1 to SAF/IGI is not timely enough to allow an inspection before
the wounded warrior physically moves into the government-owned housing). Additional
personnel deemed necessary shall accompany the commander on the pre-occupancy inspection
(the individual's commander, first sergeant, CE commander, housing/dorm manager, and local
medical RCC). The goal is to ensure the individual's medical and housing needs are being met—
if not, then the commander is responsible for ensuring appropriate steps are taken to meet them.
Submit a copy of the completed checklist and all documentation addressing deficiencies to the
IG Team Chief upon their arrival for the inspection.
A8.5. Contracted Housing Management. If housing is managed by contracted personnel, the
MAJCOM/IG and the installation leadership will work with the contractor to ensure the
inspection takes place in a timely manner.
A8.6. Personal Interview. As part of the formal WII inspection, the MAJCOM inspection
Team Chief will interview the recovering Airman one-on-one to get a sense of their overall care;
this should be documented in the report.
       342                                             AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013


   A8.7. Joint Base Housing Facility Inspections. It has been agreed that regardless which
   Service "owns/manages" the government-provided housing, Air Force inspectors will inspect
   housing occupied by Airmen; Army inspectors will inspect housing occupied by Soldiers; Navy
   inspectors will inspect housing occupied by Sailors; and Marine inspectors will inspect housing
   occupied by Marines. There is no requirement to inspect quarters already identified/certified as
   DOD compliant for recovering wounded warriors (e.g., Fisher House, Malone House); however,
   the IG Team Chief will interview the wounded warrior to ensure their needs are being met.
   Although most ADA compliant quarters meet DOD standards for the wounded warrior program,
   the IG Team Chief will interview the wounded warrior to ensure the quarters are sufficient and
   that their needs are being met. This interview need not be conducted in person.
   A8.8. Final Report Disposition. In accordance with House Resolution 4986, Section 1662, the
   MAJCOM/IG will forward copies of the final report to the installation commander, the
   commander of the affiliated Medical Treatment Facility, AF/SG and SECAF. Additionally, a
   copy of the final report will be posted on the MAJCOM/IG public web site.
         A8.8.1. AFIA/SG will build an annual consolidated AF report from all MAJCOM WII
         inspections. NLT 30 days prior to the OSD-established close-out date, AFIA will staff the
         AF WII Housing Facility Inspections report, congressional letters and ASD(HA) letter
         through SAF/IGI, SAF/FMBL, SAF/LL, AF/A4/7 and AF/SG to SAF/IG for signature.
         A8.8.2. The MAJCOM/IG will also forward a copy of the report to AFIA to assimilate data
         for the annual report to Congress. At the end of the calendar year, AFIA will prepare letters
         to select members of Congress for TIG’s signature. Letters to OSD, Senators and
         Congressmen indicate the Air Force's WII inspection requirements for the year and any
         deficiencies noted (TIG will send signed letters to the Chairman and Ranking Members of
         Senate/House Armed Services Committees). After TIG signs the letters, SAF/IGI will route
         them through DOD accordingly.
   A8.9. Inspection Checklist: The inspection checklist (Table A8.1) incorporates requirements
   set forth by DOD and is designed for a combination of interview, physical inspection and
   documentation review. It should be executed at the location to be inspected with the patient,
   case manager, and base housing facility representative present. The primary point of contact for
   scheduling the inspection should be the case manager. When possible, the inspector should
   either review applicable documents prior to the inspection or request the housing facility
   representative to bring such documents with him/her to the inspection. Documentation may
   include (but is not limited to) Pre-Occupancy Inspection checklist with associated documents,
   pending work orders on the housing facility, work orders executed within the past six months,
   asbestos documentation, lead paint documentation, pest control documentation & procedures,
   and mold documentation. Inspected areas will be rated IN COMPLIANCE, NOT IN
   COMPLIANCE, or IN COMPLIANCE WITH COMMENTS.

                          GATEKEEPER EXTERNAL PROCESS

A10.1. (AFSPC) Unit Gatekeeper Responsibilities. Unit Gatekeepers report information on
activities occurring both on- and off-base that would potentially impact the execution of a
successful inspection. Gatekeeper inputs will include activities at all GSUs and other ―attached‖
units (e.g., the 21 SW Gatekeeper would report for Cape Cod AFS, MA). The HQ AFSPC
Gatekeeper’s Master Schedule will capture all inputs, provide improved situational awareness
and help resolve conflicts. If contacted by any agency wishing to conduct an inspection related
activity at your location, the Gatekeeper will ensure the agency has coordinated the inspection
with the         HQ AFSPC Gatekeeper before you capture them in your report. Local activities
do not require prior coordination with the HQ AFSPC Gatekeeper.
A10.2. (AFSPC) Gatekeeper Appointment. Each NAF/Wing/Center will appoint                       a
Gatekeeper and Alternate Gatekeeper to monitor, coordinate and provide schedule updates.
   A10.2.1. (AFSPC) Appointment Memorandum. Unit Commanders or their designated
   representatives will appoint gatekeepers in writing according to the template on the HQ
   AFSPC/IG SharePoint Portal/CoP site.          Units will email the memorandum to
   afspc.ig.gatekeeper@us.af.mil and provide updates as changes occur.
A10.3. (AFSPC) Reporting Requirements. As a minimum, NAF/Wing/Center Gatekeepers
will update unit schedules on a quarterly basis and post to the HQ AFSPC/IG SharePoint
Portal/CoP site (i.e. by 1 Jan update will identify Jan – Mar events). If the beginning of the
quarter falls on a non-duty day, inputs are then due on the next duty day.
A10.4. (AFSPC) On-base Activities. On-base activities include anything affecting manning
availability, the unit’s mission capability or potential inspections. Examples:
   A10.4.1. (AFSPC) Exercises (e.g., any level…Joint, MAJCOM, Wing, etc).
   A10.4.2. (AFSPC) Inspections/Staff Assistance Visits (e.g., any level…AFIA, Health
   Services Inspections, ESOHCAMP Assessments, etc).

                                   REBUTTAL PROCESS

A14.1. (AFSPC) General. The HQ AFSPC/IG has developed a rebuttal process that begins
when the unit commander receives a daily summary of potential deficiencies. The commander
then has the opportunity to rebut any finding contained in the summary. The separate non-
integrated CUI teams have different rebuttal processes and will identify their requirements
through formal inspection communication with the units.
A14.2. (AFSPC) Inspection Summaries/Validation. The HQ AFSPC/IG will provide a
summary of inspection findings to the wing or unit leadership on a daily basis. Summary will
list all potential deficiencies and Recommended Improvement Areas. Findings will include a
reference which serves as the basis for the deficiency. Each finding will contain a unique
tracking number (e.g., F.4754.786227). All ―Critical‖ and ―Significant‖ findings are validated
by the appropriate HAF or HQ functional (e.g., MAJCOM OPR: HQ AFSPC/A1K).
A14.3. (AFSPC) Rebuttal Mechanics.
   A14.3.1. (AFSPC) Timeline. Submit rebuttals to potential findings within 24-hours of the
   wing or unit commander’s receipt. E-Mail rebuttals to the HQ AFSPC/IG Inspection Support
   Manager (e-mail address will be provided) as soon as they are approved by the wing or unit
   commander.
   A14.3.2. (AFSPC) Submitting rebuttals. Only the wing commander or unit commander (if
   inspecting at the unit level) can submit rebuttals.
   A14.3.3. (AFSPC) Rebuttal format. Use the provided rebuttal worksheet (an electronic
   copy will be provided) or download from the HQ AFSPC/IG SharePoint Portal/CoP website.
   Submit the rebuttal worksheet in Word format; do not convert to a .pdf format. Use the
   Major Graded Area (MGA) and tracking number assigned to each finding to uniquely
   identify a rebuttal (example: Force Support-F.4754.786227). Submit one rebuttal per
   deficiency. If one or more bullets listed under a deficiency are being rebutted, capture the
   rebuttals to each bullet on the same form. Use continuation sheets if required. Attach only
   specific references, excerpts and documentation relevant to the unit position (do not submit
   entire AFI, TO, etc.).
   A14.3.4. (AFSPC) Review process. The inspector who identified the deficiency reviews
   the information provided in the unit rebuttal, contacts the HAF or MAJCOM Functional Area
   Manager (if required), revisits the work center (if required), assesses the implications of the
   information provided and then submits a recommendation to the HQ AFPSC/IG FAM POC.
   Recommendations could include: deficiency stands as written; delete the finding; delete
   elements of the finding; revise the wording in the finding; change the severity of the finding;
   reassign the finding to a HHQ agency. The HQ AFPSC/IG FAM POC reviews the
   information provided by the unit and the inspector recommendation and provides a
   recommendation to the HQ AFSPC/IG Team Chief for final determination.
   A14.3.5. (AFSPC) What warrants a rebuttal. A Commander can rebut any finding;
   however, units should be judicious in their submission of rebuttals to maintain the integrity
   of the system.
AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I 02 January 2013                                                387


     A14.3.5.1. (AFSPC) Examples of Effective Rebuttals:
        A14.3.5.1.1. (AFSPC) If new information arrives that was not presented to the HQ
        AFSPC/IG inspector during the inspection.
        A14.3.5.1.2. (AFSPC) Evidence of conflicting guidance (e.g., the HQ AFSPC/IG
        reference conflicts with other guidance the unit is following).
        A14.3.5.1.3. (AFSPC) Accuracy (e.g., the number of records cited as being non-
        compliant is inaccurate).
  A14.3.6. (AFSPC) Closure actions on Rebuttals/Validation. HQ AFSPC/IG will provide a
  final assessment of each rebuttal to the wing or unit commander during the final daily
  summary.
