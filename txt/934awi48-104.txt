                                                                                           Pages: 11

This instruction implements AFPD 48-1, Aerospace Medical Program. It provides Blood Borne Pathogen
Exposure Control Procedures (ECP) for the 934th Airlift Wing. It establishes guidelines for the elimina-
tion or minimization of employee exposure to blood and other potentially infectious material and is
intended to comply with the requirements of OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.1030, Blood Borne Patho-
gens. The Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, Public Law 106-430 requires that this procedure be
reviewed and updated at least annually and whenever necessary to reflect new or modified tasks and pro-
cedures which affect occupational exposure and to reflect new or revised employee positions with occu-
pational exposure. The annual review shall reflect changes in technology that eliminate or reduce
exposure to blood borne pathogens and document consideration and implementation of appropriate com-
mercially available and effective safer medical devices designed to eliminate or minimize occupational
exposure. It applies to all military and civilian workers at the 934 AW who may encounter routine or
non-routine occupational exposure to blood borne pathogens including Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).


1. Scope. The Federal OSHA Blood Borne Pathogens Standard covers all employees who could "reason-
ably anticipate", as the result of performing their job duties, to have contact with blood and other poten-
tially infectious materials. "Good Samaritan" acts such as assisting a coworker with a nosebleed would
not be considered occupational exposure. For AFRC, this includes personnel designated by the com-
mander as responsible for medical assistance as part of their job.

2. Definitions:
   2.1. Biohazard Label: The biohazard label shall have the biohazard symbol, the word BIOHAZARD,
   and be fluorescent orange or orange-red, with lettering or symbols in a contrasting color.
   2.2. Blood: Human blood, human blood components, and products made from human blood.
2                                                                           934AWI48-104 3 JUNE 2005


    2.3. Blood Borne Pathogens: Pathogenic microorganisms that are present in human blood and can
    cause disease in humans. These pathogens include, but are not limited to, HBV and HIV.
    2.4. Contaminated: The presence or the reasonable anticipated presence of blood or other potentially
    infectious materials on an item or surface.
    2.5. Contaminated Sharps: Any contaminated object that can penetrate the skin including, but not
    limited to, needles, scalpels, broken glass, broken capillary tubes, and exposed ends of dental wires.
    2.6. Contaminated Laundry: Laundry that has been obviously soiled with blood or other potentially
    infectious materials or contains sharps.
    2.7. Decontamination: The use of physical or chemical means to remove, inactivate, or destroy blood
    borne pathogens on a surface or item to the point where they are no longer capable of transmitting
    infectious articles and the surface of item is rendered safe for handling, use, or disposal.
    2.8. Engineering Controls: Controls (e.g. sharps disposable containers, self-sheathing needles) that
    isolate or remove a blood borne pathogen hazard from the workplace.
    2.9. Exposure Incident: A specific eye, mouth, other mucous membrane, non-intact skin, or
    parenteral contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials that results from the perfor-
    mance of an employee's duties.
    2.10. Health Care Professional: A person whose legally permitted scope of practice allows him/her to
    independently perform the activities required such as giving Hepatitis B Vaccination and accomplish-
    ing Post-Exposure Evaluations and Follow-ups.
    2.11. Occupational Exposure: Employee skin, eye, mucous membrane, or parenteral contact with
    blood or other potentially infectious materials that results from the performance of duties.
    2.12. Other Potentially Infectious Materials:
       2.12.1. The following human body fluids: semen, vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial
       fluid, plural fluid, pericardial fluid, peritoneal fluid, amniotic fluid, saliva in dental procedures,
       any body fluid that is visibly contaminated with blood, and all body fluids in situations where it is
       difficult or impossible to differentiate between body fluids.
       2.12.2. Any unfixed tissue or organ (other than intact skin) from a human (living or dead).
       2.12.3. HIV-containing cell or tissue cultures, organ cultures, and HIV or HBV containing culture
       medium or other solutions; and blood, organs, or other tissues from experimental animals infected
       with HIV or HBV.
    2.13. Parenteral: Piercing mucous membranes or the skin barrier through such events as needle sticks,
    human bites, cuts, and abrasions.
    2.14. Personal Protective Equipment: Specialized clothing or equipment worn by an employee for
    protection against a hazard. General work clothes (e.g. uniforms, pants, shirts, and blouses) not
    intended to function as protection against a hazard are not considered to be personal protective equip-
    ment.
    2.15. Regulated Waste: Liquid or semi-liquid blood or other potentially infectious material; contami-
    nated items that would release blood or other potentially infectious materials in a liquid or semi-liquid
    state if compressed; items that are caked with dried blood or other potentially infectious materials and
934AWI48-104 3 JUNE 2005                                                                               3

   materials may be a source of occupational exposure to the employee.
   2.17. Sterilize: The use of a physical or chemical procedure to destroy all microbial life including
   highly resistant bacterial endospores.
   2.18. Universal Precautions: According to the concept of Universal Precautions, all human blood and
   certain human body fluids are treated as if known to be infectious for HIV, HBV, and other blood
   borne pathogens.
   2.19. Work Practice Control: Controls that reduce the likelihood of exposure by altering the manner
   in which a task is performed (e.g. prohibiting recapping of needles by a two-handed technique).

       5.1.1. Each building should have clean-up equipment in the janitorâ€™s closet (gloves, antiseptic
       soap, mop and bucket).
       5.1.2. Wear rubber, neoprene or waterproof work gloves during the cleaning process.
       5.1.3. Wear shoe covers and apron if you suspect potential exposure to blood during the cleaning
       operation.
       5.1.4. Wash the area with plenty of antiseptic soap and cold water (or 1 to 10 ratio of bleach and
       water). Do not use hot water on clothes and laundry, because stains will set with hot water.
       5.1.5. After the clean up, dispose of gloves and wash hands with antiseptic soap and water (or 1 to
       10 ratio of bleach and water). The clean-up solutions can be poured down the sanitary drain.

       and water (or 1 to 10 ratio of bleach and water) as soon as feasible following contact of such body
       areas with blood or other potentially infectious materials and/or after removal of gloves or other
       personal protective equipment. If hand-washing facilities are not available the employee shall use
       antiseptic hand cleanser in conjunction with clean cloth/paper or antiseptic towelettes. When anti-
       septic hand cleansers or towelettes are not available, hands shall be washed as soon as feasible.
       5.2.4. Containers: Specimens of blood or other potentially infectious materials shall be placed in
       a container that prevents leakage during collection, handling, processing, storage, transport, or
       shipping. Biohazard labels must be affixed to containers of regulated waste, refrigerators and
       freezers and other containers that are used to store or transport blood or other potentially infectious
       materials. Red bags or containers may be used instead of labeling. Blood that has been tested and
       found free of HIV or HBV and has been released for clinical use and regulated waste that has been
       decontaminated need not be labeled.
       5.2.5. Contaminated Sharps: Contaminated needles and other contaminated sharps shall not be
       bent. No routine recapping of needles. Exception to the recapping of the needle rule: where no
       alternative exists, one-handed or device assisted recapping can be done. Shearing or breaking of
       contaminated needles is prohibited. Contaminated sharps shall be placed in a sharp disposable
       container. The container shall be closable, puncture resistant, biohazard label, and leak-proof on
       the sides and bottom.
       5.2.6. Contaminated Wastes Other Than Sharps:

        tents from spilling. If the outside of a container becomes contaminated, it must be placed
        within a second suitable container. The second container will have a biohazard label.
        5.2.6.2. Equipment that may become contaminated with blood or other potentially infectious
        materials will be examined post-use and prior to servicing or shipping and be decontaminated
        as necessary. A biohazard label shall be attached to the equipment stating portions that remain
        contaminated.
        5.2.6.3. Contaminated laundry shall be placed in bags or containers that are closable, prevent
        leakage, and display a biohazard label.
     5.2.7. Eating Food, Drinking, Smoking, etc.: Eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics or lip
     balm, and handling contact lenses are prohibited in work areas where there is a reasonable likeli-
     hood of contact with infectious material. Food and drink shall not be kept in refrigerators, freezers,
     shelves, and cabinets or on countertops or benchtops where blood or other potentially infectious
     materials are present.
     5.2.8. Mouth Pipetting: Mouth pipetting/suctioning of blood or other potentially infectious mate-
     rials is prohibited.
     5.2.9. Personal Protective Equipment: If there is reasonable potential for occupational exposure to
     blood borne infectious materials, the employee will use appropriate personal protective equip-
     ment. This equipment will be provided to the employee at no cost. The equipment may be gloves,
     gowns, laboratory coats, face shields or masks, eye protection, mouthpieces, resuscitation bags,
     pocket masks, and/or other ventilation devices. The supervisor shall determine the appropriate
     personal protective equipment to be used and ensure that the employees use them.
        5.2.9.1. The supervisor maintains the personal protective equipment by repair or replacement
        as needed.
        5.2.9.2. If blood or other potentially infectious materials penetrate a garment, the garment
