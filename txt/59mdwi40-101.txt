SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include changing the 59 MDW to a smoke-free facility.
1. General Policy. All buildings in the 59 MDW are tobacco free facilities; use of tobacco is
not authorized at any 59th Medical Wing campus or surrounding medical facilities. Tobacco
includes, but is not limited to, cigars, cigarettes, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), stem pipes,
water pipes, hookahs, and smokeless products that are chewed, dipped, or sniffed. Commanders
and supervisors are responsible for enforcement to include appropriate disciplinary measures of
personnel.

     1.1. The intent of this policy is to reduce risks of possible adverse affects on care, treatment
     and services, passive smoke exposure risk to others, and to reduce threat of fire in 59 MDW
     facilities.
     1.2. The Air Force prohibits tobacco use in the workplace to protect the health of all
     individuals. All 59 MDW visitors, patients and employees, including contractors, will
     comply with this policy.
     1.3. The 559th Medical Group will ensure tobacco product cessation classes are made
     available to active duty members, retirees, and family members. Cessation classes can be
     made available to Federal government employees on a space available basis.
2. Tobacco Use Policy for Patients.
     2.1. The Air Force prohibits tobacco use in the medical treatment facility.
     2.2. The 59 MDW medical care providers may offer tobacco cessation counseling at all
     patient encounters as clinically indicated. Dental care providers will ask individuals about
     their tobacco use history at annual examination.
     2.3. The 59 MDW medical care providers shall coordinate with 559th Medical Group Health
     Promotion Flight to obtain materials and promote tobacco cessation in accordance with AFI
     40-102, Tobacco Use in the Air Force.
3. Designated Outdoor Tobacco Use Areas.
     3.1. There is one designated tobacco use area at Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center
     (Building 4550). This area is located on the exterior of the 4th floor and its unique
     designation was granted to the Aeromedical Staging facility due to its Wounded Warrior
     patient population.
     3.2. The 59 MDW staff shall ensure medical personnel, patients and patient family members
     are aware of the no smoking policy and enforce compliance.
4. Responsibilities.
     4.1. Commanders, supervisors, and staff shall enforce tobacco use policy to include
     reporting violations and appropriate disciplinary measures of personnel, if required.
     4.2. The 59 MDW Facilities and Environment Committee will provide oversight for tobacco
     use policy compliance including periodic processes for tracking compliance and development
     of strategies to eliminate violations.
     4.3. The 59 MDW Public Affairs Office (59 MDW/PA) shall periodically disseminate
     tobacco use policy information and conspicuously post tobacco cessation information for
     patients and staff.

  4.4. The 59 MLRS Facilities Management Office (SGSKF) shall ensure there are no
  designated smoking areas marked and assist in enforcing compliance in the parking areas.
  The 59 MDW parking warden program will be utilized to enforce compliance on the medical
  campus and outlying facilities.
