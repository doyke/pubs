This Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) Instruction implements Air Force Policy
Directive 32-70, Environmental Quality. This instruction does not apply to the Air National
Guard or US Air Force Reserve units and members. The instruction is in addition to Air Force
Instruction (AFI) 32-7042, Waste Management, and establishes hazardous waste (HW)
management requirements for all WPAFB activities including host, tenants, and contractors. It
implements the requirements set forth by the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(USEPA) as authorized by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Title 40 Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 260-271, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Title
49 CFR Parts 171-179, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations
Title 29 CFR 1910 and Headquarters Air Force Materiel Command (HQ AFMC) AFI 32-7042,
Waste Management. WPAFB operates a RCRA Part B Permitted facility (Building 479, Area B)
where very specific permit conditions govern the management of HW which may be stored for a
period of up to one year. WPAFB also operates a 90-day waste storage area within Building 247,
Area C that receives waste from Area C only. Activities that generate, manage and store HW
must obtain an internal 88 ABW Environmental Management Division permit. These laws,
regulations and policies place stringent requirements on the generation, management and
disposal of HW and must be adhered to at all times. Send comments and suggestions about this
publication for improvements on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to
the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). Ensure that all records created as a result of
processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction is revised to indicate the updated document name for AFI32-7042 and the new
88 ABW Asset Management Division (88 ABW/CEA).
1. Definitions: Selected definitions are provided here. Additional applicable definitions are
provided in the RCRA regulations (40 CFR Parts 260-271), DOT Hazardous Material
Transportation regulations (49 CFR Parts 171-179) and OSHA regulations (29 CFR Part 1910).
    1.1. Accumulation Site (ACCS): An area where hazardous waste from Initial
    Accumulation Points (IAPs) is consolidated. Waste may be stored at this location in
    unlimited quantities for a period of up to 90-days. Management of ACCSs must be done in
    accordance with the procedures outlined in the WPAFB HW Management Plan.
    1.2. Characteristic Hazardous Waste: A waste exhibiting one or more of the following
    properties: ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity as defined in 40 CFR Part 261.20-
    24.
    1.3. Compatible Wastes: Wastes that can be safely stored together and under normal
    conditions will not adversely react with one another.
    1.4. Empty Container: Containers which are emptied by normal means and contain less
    than 2.5cm of residue or no more than 3 percent product by volume in a container of 110
    gallons or less. Containers used to store acutely hazardous waste must be triple rinsed before
    being considered empty. Empty containers must be managed in accordance with the
    Installation Container Management and Storage Policy which is included as part of the
    WPAFB HW Management Plan.
    1.5. Field Compliance Liaison: A member of the Environmental Management Division,
    Support Branch (88ABW/CEVS) that is responsible for hazardous waste compliance at all
    IAPs and ACCS of the base.
    1.6. Generator: Any person, contractor, or organization on base whose actions result in the
    generation of a regulated hazardous waste.
    1.7. Hazardous Waste (HW): Wastes that are listed by chemical name in 40 CFR 261
    Subpart D, and/or exhibit one or more of the characteristics described in 40 CFR 261 Subpart
    C.
    1.8. Hazardous Waste Site Inspection Team (HWSIT): Rescinded per AFMC policy
    directive dated November 2004.
    1.9. Initial Accumulation Point (IAP): A specified storage area at or near the site where
    HW is initially generated. The site must be under the control of the first line supervisor of the
    operator of the process generating the waste. This site must be formally established with a
    WPAFB Form 1433, Installation Hazardous Waste Storage Permit, issued by the
    Environmental Management Division. A volume limitation of 55 gallons of HW or 1 quart of
    acutely HW is applicable at the IAP. When the volume limitation is exceeded, the site
    manager has 72 hours to remove waste and reduce the amount of waste stored at the IAP to
    less than 55 gallons. IAPs must be managed in accordance with the WPAFB HW
    Management Plan.

   1.10. Listed HW: A waste that is specifically listed by name in 40 CFR Part 261.30-34 or is
   a spill residue thereof.
   1.11. Site Manager: An individual who is appointed by the organizational commander to
   manage a HW storage location (i.e., Initial Accumulation Point (IAP) or Accumulation Site
   (ACCS)).
   1.12. Spill: A "Spill" means the spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, or dumping
   of hazardous wastes or materials which, when spilled, become hazardous wastes, into or on
   any land or water.
   1.13. Unit Environmental Coordinator (UEC): An individual appointed by the
   organizational commander to be the focal point for all HW issues within their respective
   organization. At a minimum one UEC and an alternate shall be appointed for each
   organization that handles HM and subsequently generates HW.
   1.14. Used Oil/Waste Liquid Petroleum Products (WLPP): Used oil is any oil that has
   been refined from crude oil or any synthetic oil that has been used and as a result of such use
   is contaminated by physical or chemical impurities. WLPP are waste fuels and spent non-
   halogenated petroleum products with a flash point >140 degrees Fahrenheit. To initiate the
   turn-in of used oil/WLPP, WPAFB Form 1434, Used Oil and Waste Liquid Petroleum
   Products, must be completed and forwarded to the Environmental Management Division in
   accordance with the Used Oil and WLPP Management Policy.
   1.15. Waste Minimization: Procedures implemented to reduce the amount of HW in
   volume, quantity and toxicity and to ensure that proposed methods of treatment, storage and
   disposal of HW are those best methods currently available that minimize present and future
   threat to human health and the environment. These procedures are required of all HW
   generators by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984.
2. Responsibilities: All individuals, organizations, and contractors on base must manage their
HW according to the most current installation HW Management Plan developed and maintained
by 88 ABW/ CEV as required by AFI 32-7042. Also specific organizations and individuals have
additional responsibilities for the proper management of HW as follows:
   2.1. Installation Commander (88 ABW/CC): In accordance with AFI 38-
   101_AFMCSUP, Air Force Organization, paragraph 2.3.1.3.1, at WPAFB the Wing

   and implementing the HW management program on the installation. This responsibility
   includes ensuring that all installation activities maintain compliance with all applicable
   regulations and administering the installation HW storage permit system and the installation
   HW training program. CEV also manages the EPA permitted storage facility (479) and
   serves as the base liaison to the regulatory community.
   2.3. Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO/VBD): Responsible for the
   procurement and administration of the HW disposal contract.

    regulations and/or laws.
    2.9. Legal Office (ASC/JAE): Interprets laws and regulations that govern the management
    of HW. Provides legal support for the prosecution of individuals who violate environmental
    regulations.
    2.10. Generators: Organizations that generate HW have the following responsibilities:
       2.10.1. Appoint a Unit Environmental Coordinator (UEC) and alternate by the
       organization/unit commander. The UEC will serve as an environmental coordinator to
       manage HW activities within their organization. Both the primary and the alternate UEC
       must, within 90 days of such appointment, attend the installation HW Management
