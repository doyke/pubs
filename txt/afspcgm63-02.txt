                                       Guidance Changes

         HQ AFSPC/A4S is the MAJCOM modification control point (MCP) responsible for
receiving and tracking all AF Form 1067 Modification Proposals from initiation to certification
for all space programs except Special Access Programs/Special Access Required (SAP/SAR)
programs. HQ AFSPC/A4C is the MCP responsible for receiving and tracking all AF Form
1067 Modification Proposals from initiation to certification for cyber programs except Air Force
Network/Information Transport System(AFNET/ITS) and SAP/SAR programs. AFSPC
CYSS/SCO is the MCP for AFNET/ITS programs and HQ AFSPC/A4CD is the MCP for all
SAP/SAR programs.

       All AFSPC subordinate units and other “Using Commands” will process AFSPC
modification proposals IAW AFI 63-131, Modification Management, and this guidance memo.

        Wing organizations will validate AF Form 1067, Part II as the Using Command
validation and forward to the MCP for all modification proposals for which AFSPC is the lead
command.

       Maintenance actions do not require use of AF Form 1067s or Lead Command notification
or coordination. Modifications must be approved at MAJCOM-level prior to execution.

1. HQ AFSPC Modification Proposal Process

1.1. All AF Form 1067 Modification Proposals will meet a monthly configuration review board
(CRB) for Part III Lead Command Validation and Part V Lead Command Certification/
Approval. All 1067s must be submitted to the MCP in standard e-form format no later than 10
business days prior to the board.

1.1.1. HQ AFSPC/A4/7 (sustainment modifications) and A5 (capability modifications) or their
designated representative(s) will co-chair the CRB and establish the CRB with voting members
that are key stakeholders of the system being considered for modification/change. The CRB is
the AF Form 1067 Part III validation authority and Part V certification/approval authority for all
Space and Cyber modification proposals with the exception of SAP/SAR and AFNET/ITS
programs.

1.1.2. HQ AFSPC CYSS/SCO or his or her designee will chair a Validation Certification Board
and is the AF Form 1067 Part III validation authority and Part V certification/approval authority
for all modification proposals for AFNET/ITS modification proposals.

1.1.3. HQ AFSPC/A3S and HQ AFSPC/A5C (for space systems) and HQ AFSPC/A3I and HQ
AFSPC/A5J (for cyber systems) or their designated representative(s) will co-chair the CRB and
is the AF Form 1067 Part III validation and Part V certification/approval authority for all
modification proposals regarding SAP/SAR programs.


                                GUARDIANS OF THE HIGH FRONTIER
1.2. Assigned lead command action officers (Block 13, AF Form 1067) from HQ AFSPC/
A4S/C will coordinate modification proposals through appropriate MAJCOM A-Staff
organizations prior to the CRB.

1.2.1. Lead command action officers will coordinate with HQ AFSPC/A3S and A3X for
modifications to Integrated Tactical Warning and Attack Assessment systems to comply with
Strategic Command Instruction 534-22 and NORAD Instruction 10-3 requiring the AFSPC
Operations Approval Panel and other oversight panels when modifications may impact the
Missile Warning/Missile Defense; United States Nuclear Detonation (NUDET) Detection
System (USNDS); Situational Awareness (SA); and/or Command and Control missions (i.e.,
missile warning/missile defense systems with a secondary SA mission).

1.3. Out-of-cycle AF Form 1067s will only be accomplished under urgent, emergency or safety
conditions, when time does not permit waiting for the next CRB to meet. The initiating
organization will submit out-of-cycle 1067s to the MCP for processing. The MCP will
coordinate modification proposals through appropriate MAJCOM A-Staff organizations with a
2-business day suspense. The out-of-cycle CRB will be conducted electronically via e-mail
and/or telecon.

1.4. Criteria for approval of each AF Form 1067 is based on addressing operational, technical
and economic factors. This may include: documented requirement, operational performance or
effectiveness benefit, safety and practicality for validation and estimated life-cycle cost, return
on investment and estimated impact on total ownership cost over the expected service life of the
weapon system for certification.

2. HQ AFSPC Modification Control Point Responsibilities:

2.1. Review AF Form 1067s for proper format, completeness and sufficient justification.

2.1.1. Ensure each AF Form 1067 covers no more than one configuration item (i.e., AN/FRC-
178, AN/FPS-85, etc.). Should the configuration item modification, in turn, modify the end
item, a separate AF Form 1067 is required for the end item. If a single configuration item has
fielded systems under different lead commands, a separate AF Form 1067 must be processed for
each lead command. Ensure each AF Form 1067 spells out the requirement and is not simply a
request for a particular piece of equipment.

2.2. Assign a using/lead command control number in block 17 as appropriate to modification
proposals and log each AF Form 1067 into a centrally managed database. Incomplete AF Form
1067s or forms with inadequate justification will be returned to the initiating organization.

2.2.1. Consolidate all 1067s received from lead command action officers and forward to the CRB
co-chairs and other members NLT 5 days prior to meeting of the CRB. Lead command action
officers, in coordination with the initiating organization, will be responsible to brief the CRB and
answer any questions justifying validation of the proposal.




                                GUARDIANS OF THE HIGH FRONTIER
2.3. Schedule and conduct the CRB monthly.

2.4. Forward all validated proposals to the Single Manager Office identified in Block 15 for Part
IV processing.

2.5. Forward certified AF Form 1067 modification proposals projected to exceed dollar
thresholds identified in AFI 10-601 to HQ AFSPC/A5X. HQ AFSPC/A5X will forward to
AF/A5R for approval.
