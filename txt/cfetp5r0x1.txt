                   CAREER FIELD EDUCATION AND TRAINING PLAN

Part I

Preface

1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and
training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support
resources, and minimum core task requirements for this specialty. The CFETP will provide
personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field training.
NOTE: Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position
qualification training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts; supervisors plan, manage, and control training within the
specialty using both parts of the plan.

2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A
explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression
information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C
associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, experience, training,
and other); and Section D indicates resource constraints. Some examples are funds, manpower,
equipment and facilities. Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt
through MSgt.

2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A: identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS)
and includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training
Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course and core task and correspondence course
requirements. Section B: contains the course objective list (COL) and training standards
supervisors will use to determine if Airmen satisfied training requirements. Section C: identifies
available support materials. An example is a Qualification Training Package (QTP), which may
be developed to support proficiency training; Section D: identifies a training course index
supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training. Included here are both
mandatory and optional courses; Section E: identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements
supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification
needs. At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan and conduct
training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.

3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive
effective and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career. This plan will enable us
to train today’s work force for tomorrow’s jobs.




                                                   1
ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED

Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL)  An evolving, outcomes-focused approach to
education, training and performance aiding that blends standards-based distributed learning
models emphasizing reusable content objects, content and learning management systems,
performance support systems/devices, web applications services and connectivity. ADL is an
evolution of distributed learning (distance learning) that emphasizes collaboration on standards-
based versions of reusable objects, networks and learning management systems, yet may include
some legacy methods and media. ADL is structured learning that takes place without requiring
the physical presence of an instructor. Although the AF uses the term advanced distributed
learning, some federal agencies and DoD components may use the term distance learning. These
terms refer to the same basic concept.

Advanced Training (AT)  Formal course that provides individuals who are qualified in one or
more positions of their Air Force Specialty (AFS) with additional skills and knowledge to
enhance their expertise in the career field. Training is for selected career Airman in the
advanced level of the AFS.

Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM)  Representative appointed by the respective HQ
USAF Deputy Chief of Staff or Under Secretariat, to ensure assigned AF specialties are trained
and utilized to support AF mission requirements. AFCFM is the OPR; however, works in
concert with MAJCOM Functional Managers (FMs) as required.

Air Force Specialty (AFS)  A group of positions with the same title and code that require
common qualifications.

Air Reserve Component (ARC) – This term is used as an overarching term when referring to
both the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve component together.

Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP)  CFETP is a comprehensive core
training document that identifies: life-cycle education and training requirements; training support
resources; and minimum core task requirements for a specialty. The CFETP aims to give
personnel a clear path and instill a sense of industry in career field training.

Chaplain Assistant Apprentice Course (CAAC) – The Chaplain Assistant Apprentice Course
is a technical training course (Type-3) that provides initial skills training to newly assigned
Chaplain Assistants. Upon graduation, students are awarded the 3-skill level.

Core Task  Tasks the AFCFM identify as minimum qualification requirements for everyone
within an AFSC, regardless of duty position. Core tasks may be specified for a particular skill
level or in general across the AFSC. In this CFETP, core tasks are identified with a 5 or 7 in
column 2 of the STS.

Course Objective List (COL)  A publication derived from initial and advanced skills course
training standard, identifying the tasks and knowledge requirements and respective standards
provided to achieve a 3- or 7-skill level in this career field. Supervisors use the COL to assist in
conducting graduate evaluations.

Direct Reporting Unit (DRU) - A subdivision of the Air Force, directly subordinate to theChief
of Staff, US Air Force. A DRU performs a mission that does not fit into any of the MAJCOMs.
A DRU has many of the same administrative and organizational responsibilities as a MAJCOM.

Distributed Training  Structured learning mediated with technology that does not require the
physical presence of the instructor. Distributed learning models can be used in combination with
other forms of instruction or it can be used to create wholly virtual classrooms.

Duty Position Tasks  Tasks assigned to an individual for the position currently held. These
include as a minimum all core tasks that correspond to the duty position as directed by the
AFCFM or MFM, and tasks assigned by the supervisor.

Field Operating Agency (FOA) – FOAs are subdivisions of the Air Force directly subordinate
to a headquarters US Air Force functional manager. A FOA performs field activities beyond the
scope of the MAJCOMs. The activities are specialized or associated with an Air Force-wide
mission and do not include functions performed in management headquarters (such as AMC),
unless specifically directed by a DoD authority. Two examples are the Air Force Personnel
Center (AFPC) under the DCS, Personnel, and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations
(AFOSI) under The Inspector General. Similar organizations at MAJCOM level are called
MAJCOM FOAs.

Functional Manager – Senior leaders, designated by the appropriate functional authority (FA)
who provide day-to-day management responsibility over specific functional communities at the
MAJCOM, FOA, DRU or ARC level. While they should maintain an institutional focus in
regards to resource development and distribution, FMs are responsible for ensuring their
specialties are equipped, developed and sustained to meet the functional community’s mission as
well as encourage force development opportunities in order to meet future needs of the total Air
Force mission.

Go/No-Go  The “Go” is the stage at which a trainee individual has gained enough skill,
knowledge and experience to perform the tasks without supervision, meeting the task standard.
“No-Go” is the stage at which the trainee has not gained enough skill, knowledge, and
experience to perform the task without supervision, does not meet task standard.

Initial Skills Training  A formal school course that results in an AFSC 3-skill level award for
enlisted or mandatory training for upgrade to qualified officers.

Master Task List (MTL) – A comprehensive list (100%) of all tasks performed within a work
center and consisting of the current CFETP or Air Force Job Qualification Standard (AFJQS)

deployment and/or UTC requirements.

                                                 3
Master Training Plan (MTP) – Employs a strategy for ensuring the completion of all work
center job requirements by using a Master Task Listing and provides milestones for task, Career
Development Course (CDC) completion and prioritizes deployment/UTC, home station training
tasks, upgrade and qualification tasks.

Occupational Survey Report (OSR)  A detailed report showing the results of an occupational
survey of tasks performed within a particular AFS.

On-The-Job Training (OJT)  Hands-on, “over-the-shoulder” training conducted to certify
personnel in both upgrade (skill level award) and job qualification (position certification
training).

Proficiency Training  Additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training
courses, or on-the-job training, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge
beyond the minimum required for upgrade.

Qualification Training (QT)  Hands-on performance training designed to qualify personnel in
a specific position. This training occurs both during and after upgrade training to maintain up-to-
date qualifications.

Resource Constraints  Resource deficiencies, such as money, facilities, time, manpower and
equipment that preclude desired training from being delivered.

Specialty Training  The total training process used to qualify Airmen in their assigned
specialty.

Specialty Training Standard (STS)  An AF publication that describes an AFS in terms of
tasks and knowledge an Airman in that specialty may be expected to perform or to know on the
job. Also identifies the training provided to achieve a 3-, 5- or 7-skill level within an enlisted
AFS. It further serves as a contract between AETC and the functional user to show which of the
overall training requirements for an AFSC are taught in formal schools and correspondence
courses.

Standard  An exact value, a physical entity, or an abstract concept, the appropriate authority,
custom, or common consent sets up and defines to serve as a reference, model, or rule in
measuring quantities or qualities, developing practices or procedures, or evaluating results. A
fixed quantity or quality.

Total Force  All collective Air Force components (active, reserve, guard, and civilian
elements) of the US Air Force.

Training Capability  The ability of a unit or base to provide training. Authorities consider the
availability of equipment, qualified trainers, study reference materials, and so on in determining
a unit’s training capability.

Type 3 Training – This is the more common AFS-centered training of a continuing nature
conducted at an AETC base, location, or station. It includes courses designed for initial training,
retraining from one AFS to another, training on special or new equipment and procedures,
advancement within an AFS, and initial skill multiphase AFSC awarding courses.

Type 5 Training – This training includes training conducted by the Army, Navy, Air Force
agency or unit other than AETC, and other government agencies inside or outside of the
Department of Defense (DoD).

Type 6 Training – Formal courses developed for export to a field location (in place of resident
training) for trainees to complete without the on-site support of the formal school instructor.

Upgrade Training (UGT)  Mandatory training that leads to attainment (award) of higher level
of proficiency (skill level).

Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW)  A forum used to determine education and
training requirements, by bringing together the expertise to establish the most effective mix of
formal and on-the-job training for the AFS skill level. The U&TW process begins with a
Specialty Training Requirements Team (STRT) meeting that is conducted prior to the U&TW
and results in the development of a Course Resource Estimate (CRE). The primary participants
in the U&TW process include AFCFM, AETC Training Program Manager (TPM), AETC
Training Manager (TM), MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFMs), ARC personnel, and AFS
Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). Other participants may include representatives from Air
University/A4L (formerly Air Force Institute for Advanced Distributed Learning [AFIADL]) for
CDCs, AETC CDC Writers, Air Force Occupational Measurement Squadron (AFOMS) for
Occupational Survey Report (OSR) and briefings, Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC)
Education, Training, and Classification, and AETC Instructional Technology Unit (ITU)
Representative.

Wartime Course  Comprised of those tasks that must be taught when courses are accelerated
in a wartime environment. Wartime tasks are the tasks to be taught in the 3-level course when
the wartime courses have been activated. In response to a wartime scenario, these tasks will be
taught in the 3-level course in a streamlined training environment. These tasks are only for those
career fields that still need them applied to their schoolhouse tasks.




                                                 5
Section A - General Information

1. Purpose: This CFETP provides information necessary for the Air Force Career Field
Manager (AFCFM), MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFM), commanders, training managers,
supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage and conduct an effective and efficient career
field-training program. This plan outlines the training that individuals in this AFS should receive
in order to develop and progress throughout their career. This plan identifies initial skills,
upgrade, qualification, advanced and proficiency training. Initial skills training is the AFS
specific training an individual receives upon entry into the AF or upon retraining into this
specialty for award of the 3-skill level. Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one of
the technical training centers. For AFSC 5R0X1, initial skills training is conducted at the USAF
Chaplain Corps College at Fort Jackson SC. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses,
task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award
of the 3-, 5-, 7- and 9-skill levels. Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance
training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position. This training program occurs
both during and after the upgrade training process. It is designed to provide the performance
skills and knowledge required to do the job. Advanced training is formal specialty training used
for selected Airmen. Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable
advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to personnel to increase their skills
and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade. The CFETP has several purposes,
some are:

1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct and evaluate a career field-training
program. Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an
individual’s career.

1.2. Identifies task and knowledge requirements for each skill level in the specialty and
recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.

1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the
training delivery method.

1.4. Identifies major resource constraints which impacts full implementation of the desired
career field training process.

2. Uses. The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive
and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.

2.1. AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, non-resident, field and
exportable training based upon requirements established by the users and documented in Part II
of the CFETP. They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for
obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.

2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial,
upgrade, and proficiency requirements. OJT, resident training and contract training or



                                                  6
exportable courses can satisfy identified requirements. MAJCOM-developed training to support
this AFSC must be identified for inclusion into this plan.

2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.
The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.

3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is approval authority. Also, the AFCFM will
initiate an annual review of this document (through Eaker Center/MSOT) to ensure currency and
accuracy. MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate
on the career field training requirements. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate
duplicate training.

Section B - AFS Career Progression and Information

4. Specialty Description.

4.1. Specialty Summary. The Chaplain Assistant Career Field builds a culture of spiritual care
and facilitates the free exercise of religion of Air Force members, their families and other
authorized personnel. As experts in principles of religious diversity, religious accommodation,
major faith group requisites, privileged communication and religious program management,
Chaplain Assistants advise leaders at all levels on religious accommodation, ethical, moral and
morale issues, especially for the enlisted force. As the enlisted component of Religious Support
Teams (RST), Chaplain Assistants are uniquely trained in crisis intervention to include
intervention counseling in moments of crisis, response to crises and suicide prevention and
intervention. In addition, Chaplain Assistants are actively engaged and intentionally integrated
into unit engagement plans to include unit meetings, commander calls, training with the unit and
other unit activities. They also are trained in religious support to hospitals and mortuaries.
Chaplain Assistants meet the diverse needs of military communities by managing religious
programs, administrative, financial, and facility support. They recruit, train and organize
volunteers for specific religious ministries. Chaplain Assistants conduct themselves in a manner
that brings credit, pride and honorable distinction to the United States Air Force and its Chaplain
Corps. Related DoD Occupational Subgroup: 156100.

4.2. Duties and Responsibilities.

4.2.1. Manage religious programs. Chaplain Assistants partner with chaplains to develop,
manage, control and evaluate religious programs to ensure effectiveness. This capability is
critical to Airmen and their dependents in contingency and steady state environments.

4.2.1.1. Resource and manage support of religious observances to include worship, liturgies,
rites and other religious requirements for all faith groups.

4.2.1.2. Manage, in conjunction with Chaplain Corps personnel (e.g., Chaplains, GS [General
Service] employees) manage manpower positions, personnel, lay volunteers, appropriated funds,
Chapel Tithes and Offerings Funds (CTOF), non-appropriated and Morale, Welfare and
Recreation (MWR) funds, religious facilities, supplies and equipment.

4.2.1.3. Manage chapel administration to include records management, forms, publications,
publicity, professional correspondence, background checks, operating instructions, suspense
actions and other administrative needs of the Chaplain Corps mission.

4.2.2. Advise leadership at all levels on religious accommodation, ethical, moral, morale issues
and needs, primarily for, and regarding, the enlisted force. Commanders, Command Chiefs,
group superintendents, first sergeants and supervisors at all levels should know the issues
affecting their Airmen and how to best address them. Chaplain Assistants are a trusted source
for valid, real-time information. As the faces and voices of our enlisted Airmen, Chaplain
Assistants integrate into units and appropriately advise leaders on the issues and challenges
Airmen face.

                                                 8
4.2.3. Conduct crisis intervention counseling. The Chaplain Corps is the only function with
100% privileged communication (see 10 U.S.C. Chapter 47A, Military Rules of Evidence, Rule
503) and Chaplain Assistants are commonly the first line of care for Airmen in need. Facilitating
care for Airmen early in a crisis enhances resiliency, mission readiness and capability. Crisis
intervention counseling is an immediate, interventional approach to providing mental and moral
support with the aim of restoring the person to the level of functioning prior to the crisis. This
capability includes counseling in moments of crisis, response to crises and suicide prevention
and intervention. While every NCO performs counseling (see AFPAM 36-2241, Professional
Development Guide, Section 10E), Chaplain Assistants possess the core capability to care for
Airmen at the point of crisis. They are specially trained to identify potential problems and assist
individuals get the professional help they need. Through crisis intervention counseling, Chaplain
Assistants mitigate crises such as suicide, grief, traumatic stress or other forms of crisis.
Chaplain Assistants will not, at any time, conduct spiritual counseling and will immediately refer
people in need of spiritual counseling to a Chaplain. Chaplain Assistants may make referrals to
other agencies for issues not of a spiritual nature as appropriate.

4.2.4. Intentionally integrate, as part of the RST, into unit ministry and engagement plans as a
resource for meeting the spiritual needs of Airmen. Unit Engagement is best defined when unit
members embrace chaplain assistants as “one of them” through participation in unit meetings,
commander calls and other unit activities. Chaplain Assistants conduct unit engagement jointly
with their RST partner(s) or independently.

4.2.5. Manage RST functions, personnel readiness and deployment taskings. Develop,
coordinate and review operations plans and annexes. Coordinate religious and pastoral support
requirements with base supporting agencies. Manage religious support during contingencies for
combat or humanitarian relief operations. Coordinate religious and pastoral support
requirements with base agencies. Prepare and present religious customs and culture briefings.
Respond to aircraft crash and mass casualty sites, hostage situations, casualty collection points,
evacuation and deployment processing points and work centers. Conduct spiritual triage by
applying listening, observation and interviewing skills. Protect privileged communication
obtained through chaplain pastoral counseling and intervention counseling. Coordinate and
facilitate force protection.

5. Skill and Career Progression.
Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to the superintendent skill level
play an important role in the Air Force's ability to accomplish its mission. It is essential that
everyone involved in training must do his or her part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective
training program. The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure each individual
receives viable training at appropriate points in their career.

5.1. Apprentice (3) Level. The initial skills course, Chaplain Assistant Apprentice, must be
completed for the award of AFSC 5R031. Initial skills training requirements were identified
during the 5R0X1 STRT meeting held on 26-27 June 2013 and finalized during the U&TW
teleconference held on 19 September 2013. The decision to train specific tasks and knowledge
items in the initial skills course was based on a review of the Occupational Survey Report (OSR)
data and subject matter expert (SME) inputs. Task and knowledge training requirements are


                                                9
identified in the specialty training standard, at Part II, Sections A and B. Individuals must
complete the initial skills course to be awarded AFSC 5R031.

5.2. Journeyman (5) Level. Upgrade training to the 5-skill level in this specialty consists of
task and knowledge training provided in CDC 5R051; completion of the core task requirements
identified in the STS (Part II, Section A of this CFETP); and all duty position tasks identified by
the supervisor. Qualification in and possession of AFSC 5R031 is mandatory for award of
AFSC 5R051. Mandatory experience consists of religious program management, advising
leadership, crisis intervention counseling and unit engagement.

5.3. Craftsman (7) Level. Begin upgrade training to the 7-skill level upon selection to SSgt.
UGT consists of completing all core task requirements identified in the STS (Part II, Section A
of this CFETP) and all duty position requirements identified by the supervisor. Qualification in
and possession of AFSC 5R051 is mandatory for award of AFSC 5R071. Mandatory experience
consists of managing personnel and resources to advise leadership, conducting crisis intervention
counseling, engaging in units and managing religious programs.
5.4. Superintendent (9) Level. SMSgts are awarded AFSC 5R091 upon assuming the required
grade, completion of USAF Senior NCO Academy, and recommendation of the supervisor.
Qualification in and possession of AFSC 5R071 is mandatory for award of AFSC 5R091.
Mandatory experience consists of leading and managing Chaplain Corps activities.

6. Training Decisions

The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire
spectrum of training requirements for the Chaplain Assistant career field. The spectrum includes
a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements. The strategy must be
apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to
training. Training decisions were made during the 5R0X1 STRT meeting held 26-27 June 2013
and finalized during the U&TW teleconference held on 19 September 2013.

6.1. Initial Skills. The initial skills course is developed by Eaker Center/MSOT at Maxwell
AFB to provide training needed to prepare graduates for Chaplain Assistant apprentice related
positions.

6.2. Five Level Upgrade Requirements. The 5-level CDC 5R051 is developed to provide
required training for upgrade in Chaplain Assistant related positions.

6.3. Seven Level Upgrade Requirements. No course is required for 7- level upgrade.

6.4. Task Qualification Training (TQT). Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and
High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Defense Functional Area Task Qualification Training (TQT)
provides personnel the ability to demonstrate proficiency in performing mission-critical tasks in
a CBRNE environment. TQT is accomplished after CBRNE Defense Awareness and Survival
Skills. Additional information can be found in AFMAN 10-2503, Operations in a Chemical,
Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Environment.



                                                10
6.4.1. To fulfill chaplain assistant TQT, wing chaplains and NCOICs should ensure Chaplain
Corps specific inputs are incorporated into local exercise scenarios. Chaplain Corps members on
the Exercise Evaluation Team should evaluate the Religious Support Team (RST) members
participating in the exercise.

6.4.2. The following STS items will constitute the TQT requirements for chaplain assistants:
item 6.3. Develop Deployed Ministry Plan; 6.4. Support Field Religious Observances; 6.10.1.
Operate Control Center; 6.10.3. Obtain Resources; and 6.12. Participate in Field Training
Exercise.

7. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF). CCAF provides the opportunity to earn an
Associate in Applied Science Degree. Enrollment in CCAF occurs automatically upon
completion of basic military training and assignment to an Air Force career field. Note:
Chaplain Assistant retrainees must request enrollment into the Social Services degree program
whereas non-prior service (NPS) are automatically enrolled. In addition to the associate degree
program, CCAF offers the following:

7.1. CCAF Instructor Certification (CIC). CCAF offers the CIC Program for qualified
instructors who teach CCAF collegiate-level credit awarding courses at a CCAF affiliated
school. The CIC is a professional credential that recognizes the instructor’s extensive faculty
development training, education and qualification required to teach a CCAF course, and formally
acknowledges the instructor’s practical teaching experience. Qualified officer, enlisted, civilian
and other service instructors are eligible for this certification.

7.2. Instructional Systems Development (ISD) Certification. Upon completion of ISD
training and certification requirements, individuals who develop CCAF courses and curriculum
at CCAF affiliated schools may be nominated by their school commander/commandant for ISD
certification. See the CCAF General Catalog for more information.

7.3. Degree Requirements All Airmen are automatically entered into the CCAF. Prior to
completing an associate degree, the 5-skill level must be awarded. For current degree
requirements, see the online CCAF General Catalog.

7.4. Additional off-duty education is a personal choice that is encouraged for all. Individuals
desiring to become an AETC Instructor should possess or be actively pursuing an associate
degree. Special Duty Assignment (SDA) requires an AETC instructor candidate to have a CCAF
degree or be within one year of completion (45 semester hours). A degreed faculty is necessary
to maintain accreditation through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS:

2.1. Lists in column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks,
knowledge, and Technical References (TR) necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 3, 5,
and 7-skill level. Column 2 (Core/Wartime Tasks) identifies by “5” and “7” the core task
training requirements, and by “W” the wartime training requirements.

NOTE: Tasks are functionally grouped by subject and/or job position to aid task selection and
reduce duplication. Supervisors may select tasks from any attachment to accurately define a job.

2.2. Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and
knowledge training requirements. Use automated training management systems to document
technician qualifications, if available. Task certification must show a certification or completed
date. (As a minimum, use the following column designators: Training Start, Training Complete,
Trainer Initials, and Trainee Initials).

2.3. Shows formal training requirements. Column 4 shows the proficiency to be demonstrated
on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task and knowledge and the career
knowledge provided by the correspondence course.

Measurement Squadron, by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career
fields. The test samples knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team
members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based on study
references listed in the WAPS catalog. WAPS is not applicable to the Air Reserve Component.

2.7. Documentation. Using the MTL, identify all duty position requirements, including those
core tasks associated with the current duty position, by circling the sub-paragraph number next to
the task statement.

                                            Explanations

* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to
define a level of knowledge for a specific task. (Example: b and 1b)

** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not
directly related to any specific task, or for a subject common to several tasks.

- This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided
in the course or CDC.

Section B--Course Objective List

1. Measurement. Each objective is indicated as follows: W indicates task or subject
knowledge which is measured using a written test, PC indicates required knowledge or task
performance which is measured with a performance progress check, and PC/W indicates
separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a performance
progress check and a written test. P indicates required task performance, which is measured with
a performance test, while P/W indicates separate measurement by a performance test and a
written test. PC/P/W indicates separate measurement by a progress check, performance test and
a written test.

2. Standard. The standard is 70% on written examinations. Standards for performance
measurement are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist.
Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check, and students may be
required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained. A student
will undergo academic review upon failing their second written examination or a written
examination and two performance tests or four performance tests. The range of actions includes
probationary continuation, special individualized assistance/re-test, wash-back or elimination.

3. Proficiency Level. Most task performance is taught to the "2b" proficiency level which
means the student can do most parts of the tasks, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of
the task (partially proficient). The student can also determine step by step procedures for doing
the task.
