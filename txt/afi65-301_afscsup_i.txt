                                          Chapter 1

                                     AUDIT REPORTS

1.1. Overview. The Air Force Audit Agency (AFAA) is the sole provider of internal audit
services to the Air Force, and a report is the usual product of an AFAA audit. This chapter
provides information on processing AFAA audit reports and tracking the implementation of
report recommendations. Attachment 3 identifies report processing responsibilities. In addition,
public accountants audit nonappropriated fund (NAF) activities and issue reports following
policy in AFPD 65-3. Chapter 5 contains information on public accountant audits and reports of
NAF activities.
1.2. Audit Process. AFAA uses an audit process that attempts to make the most efficient and
effective use of audit resources. Prior to announcing an audit, AFAA conducts substantial
preliminary research to identify appropriate audit subjects that AFAA includes in a plan it
provides to management annually. The process permits flexibility and timely adjustment of audit
requirements due to changes in Air Force policy and emphasis.
   1.2.1. Audit Phases. Each audit consists of three phases: research, application, and report
   processing. The research phase encompasses all actions needed to define audit objectives
   and thoroughly plan the audit. The research phase culminates with development of the audit
   program which provides the analytical methodology for a thorough examination designed to
   disclose deficiencies and their underlying causes and impact. During the application phase,
   auditors gather adequate evidence to support audit results and provide a basis for specific
   recommendations. At the conclusion of field work, the AFAA prepares a draft report that
   presents identified audit results and recommendations so management can take appropriate
   corrective actions without the need for further review or study. AFAA releases the draft
   report to management for formal comments. After receiving the management comments,
   AFAA adds them to the final report, along with an AFAA evaluation, and distributes the
   final report. Designated activities formally track the final report until management indicates
   it has implemented all the agreed-to actions. Follow-up audits determine whether actions
   taken by management corrected cited deficiencies.
   1.2.2. Deconflicting Audits. Before starting each audit, AFAA first determines if conducting
   the audit would adversely affect the units involved. AFAA will defer the audit start or select
   other locations when the unit is experiencing significant operational demands (i.e.,
   deployments, exercises, or inspections) and conducting the audit would conflict with the
   unusual workload demands. Deconflicting audits is accomplished through coordination
   between AFAA and the base, major command (MAJCOM), field operating agency (FOA),
   direct reporting unit (DRU), and Air National Guard (ANG) management. NOTE:
   Throughout the remainder of this instruction, MAJCOM is used as a collective term to
   denote “MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, and ANG.”
   1.2.3. Audit Limitation. Internal audits do not criticize responsible management decisions.
   Most management decisions involve some degree of risk and uncertainty. Even when later
   events show the wrong decision was made, this, by itself, does not mandate an audit report.
   Unsuccessful decisions become subject to audit when they result in inefficient operations,
 6                                               AFI65-301_AFSCSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2014


     inadequate procedures, or other deficiencies and when reporting them would lead to
     improving systems, procedures, or avoiding future errors.
1.3. Types of Reports.
     1.3.1. Air Force-Level Reports. AFAA Air Force-level audit reports are the result of
     centrally managed, single or multi-site, audits that the AFAA addresses to the Secretariat, Air
     Staff, or MAJCOM. AFAA also provides these reports to the Assistant Secretary for
     Financial Management and Comptroller (SAF/FM) for tracking recommendations and to the
     Department of Defense Inspector General (DoDIG) for information. The AFAA issues two
     types of Air Force-level reports: standard and interim.
        1.3.1.1. Standard Report. The standard report (also known as a “blue book”) represents
        the normal reporting vehicle for conveying the results of Air Force-wide audits.
        1.3.1.2. Interim Report. AFAA issues interim reports (a) when audit results require
        prompt management attention and timeliness is critical (quick-reaction) or (b) to convey
        the audit status for a lengthy audit (preliminary). The interim report provides
        management an opportunity to initiate early corrective actions on identified findings and
        for AFAA to acknowledge those actions in the audit report.
     1.3.2. Installation-Level Reports. AFAA installation-level audit reports usually result from
     single-site audits covering issues specific to an activity or installation. The AFAA issues
     three types of installation-level reports: regular and interim.
        1.3.2.1. Regular Report. The regular report is the most commonly issued installation-
        level report. AFAA area audit offices use regular reports to convey the results of
        installation-level audits.
        1.3.2.2. Interim Report. AFAA area audit offices issue interim reports for the reasons
        cited in paragraph 1.3.1.2.
1.4. Draft Report Processing. The AFAA sends draft reports to tenant, installation, MAJCOM,
Air Staff, or Secretariat officials, as appropriate, for comments. Attachment 3 provides a list of
responsibilities for processing draft Air Force-level reports.
     1.4.1. Air Force-Level Reports. AFAA simultaneously distributes draft reports to the
     Secretariat, Air Staff, or MAJCOM office of primary responsibility (OPR) and applicable
     offices of collateral responsibility (OCRs).
     1.4.2. Installation-Level Reports. The AFAA distributes each draft report to the designated
     unit audit focal point who forwards it to the functional OPR for comment. The audit focal
     point acts as a liaison officer between management and AFAA and monitors audit project
     and report processes, including follow-up tracking. AFAA addresses installation-level
     reports to the appropriate commander and to other units having oversight authority (e.g.,
     MAJCOM).
1.5. Management Comments. Management will respond in writing to all draft audit reports
containing recommendations or potential monetary benefits (PMB). Reference paragraph 1.5.3
for potential responses. AFAA includes management comments verbatim, along with an audit
evaluation, in the final report. The management OPR and AFAA auditors will coordinate closely
so the final report fully documents management’s position on issues in the report. Note:
Management may verbally coordinate on reports that do not contain recommendations or PMB.
AFI65-301_AFSCSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2014                                                        7


  1.5.1. Comment Requirements. Management will write comments concisely and include:
     1.5.1.1. A statement of       concurrence    or   nonconcurrence    on   each    finding,
     recommendation, and PMB.
     1.5.1.2. Appropriate comments describing intended or completed corrective actions and
     an actual or estimated completion date for each corrective action. If corrective actions
     will take longer than a year, the management comments should contain interim
     milestones for completing major segments or action.
     1.5.1.3. Rationale for any disagreements.
     1.5.1.4. Comments on the reasonableness of all auditor-estimated PMB. See Chapter 4
     for further information on PMB. Note: When management corrects deficiencies during
     the audit, the draft report normally presents the findings and recognizes management's
     actions in lieu of a recommendation. If the report contains PMB, management must still
     comment on the reasonableness of the PMB estimate.
  1.5.2. Suspense Dates. For reports with recommendations or PMB, AFAA normally allows
  management 30 calendar days from the date of the draft report to provide written comments.
  For interim reports, AFAA normally allows management 15 calendar days. For reports with
  no recommendations or PMB, AFAA normally allows management 15 calendar days to
  provide a verbal or e-mail concurrence and 30 days to provide a written response.
     1.5.2.1. The AFAA can grant extensions for management comments in unusual
     circumstances. If management cannot respond by the due date, the management OPR
     telephones or e-mails the AFAA and requests an extension. AFAA can grant extensions,
     usually in 15-day increments, not to exceed 30 days from the original suspense date.
     1.5.2.2. For oral requests exceeding 15 days from the original suspense date, the
     management OPR will follow up with a written request that includes both the reasons for
     the delay and a firm date when AFAA can expect to get management comments.
  1.5.3. Potential Responses. The following list provides potential responses to audit
  recommendations. See Attachment 2 for specific examples of management comments.
     1.5.3.1. If management agrees with the findings, recommendations, and PMB, the
     management comments will describe corrective actions, both taken or planned, and give
     actual or planned completion dates. Planned completion dates should be at least 90 days
     from the date comments are provided. Reference paragraph A2.1.
     1.5.3.2. If management agrees with the findings and agrees action is required but not the
     actions recommended in the report, management can concur with intent and propose
     other ways to correct the reported deficiencies. The response must explain what action
     management will take to correct the problem. AFAA evaluates the responses and does
     not consider such responses as nonresponsive if the alternative action would correct the
     problem. Reference paragraph A2.2.
     1.5.3.3. If management agrees with the findings and recommendations but disagrees with
     the PMB amount, management must clearly state the reason for disagreement and give a
     revised PMB estimate. If management disagrees there will be any PMB, the AFAA will
     elevate the entire amount as a nonconcurrence for resolution in accordance with Chapter
     3. If management agrees there will be a PMB, but specifies a lesser amount, the AFAA
 8                                             AFI65-301_AFSCSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2014


        will elevate only the difference between the management estimate and the AFAA
        estimate. Reference paragraph A2.3
        1.5.3.4. If management nonconcurs with any finding, management comments should
        specify the reason for the nonconcurrence. The AFAA may elevate the nonconcurrence
        for resolution in accordance with Chapter 3. Reference paragraph A2.4.
        1.5.3.5. If management concurs with the finding but does not agree corrective actions are
        necessary, management should explicitly agree with the finding and explain the reason
        corrective actions are not appropriate. The AFAA audit team may elevate the
        nonconcurrence for resolution in accordance with Chapter 3. Reference paragraph A2.5.
     1.5.4. Disagreements. Management will notify AFAA immediately if they disagree with any
     report finding, recommendation, or PMB. Management will meet with AFAA and explain
     their position on the points of disagreement or introduce new information. These discussions
     promote effective corrective action by clarifying audit findings, recommendations, and PMB.
     AFAA may revise the draft report after discussions with management.
1.6. Management Comments Evaluation. After the management OPR provides comments to
AFAA, the AFAA audit team will evaluate the comments to determine if they meet the
requirements of paragraph 1.5.1. and corrective actions, taken or proposed, are adequate and
timely. When management comments are not responsive or when management does not provide
comments within the required time, AFAA follows the procedures described in Chapter 3. When
management comments are responsive, the AFAA audit team inserts the comments and an
AFAA evaluation into the final report and distributes the report.
1.7. Revised Report Procedures. If, after issuing a draft report for comment, the audit
management team revises the report (paragraph 1.5.4.), the audit team will reissue the report for
comment. AFAA will allow management an appropriate amount of time to comment on the
revised report, not to exceed 30 days.
     1.7.1. Air Force-Level Reports. The Air Force Audit Agency, Pentagon Liaison Office
     (SAF/AGA) distributes copies of the revised draft Air Force-level report to the HQ USAF
     OPR and all other activities that received the initial draft report.
     1.7.2. Installation-Level Reports. The AFAA team chief distributes the revised draft report
     to the unit audit focal point and other activities that received the initial draft report.
1.8. Final Report Distribution.
     1.8.1. Air Force-Level Reports. AFAA distributes final reports to applicable HQ USAF
     offices, SAF/FM, the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff, applicable MAJCOMs, and the DoDIG.
     AFAA also prepares follow-up tracking sheets and forwards them to the Deputy Assistant
     Secretary for Financial Operations (SAF/FMP). SAF/FMP personnel monitor and report on
     the implementation of corrective actions agreed to in Air Force-level audit reports.
     1.8.2. Installation-Level Reports. AFAA distributes final installation-level reports to
     responsible unit officials and to applicable MAJCOM audit focal points. Both the unit and
     MAJCOM audit focal points, in turn, track the recommendations and ensure management
     implements all agreed-to corrective actions.
1.9. Report Availability. The draft report is an internal Air Force action document and is not
widely distributed. However, the final audit report is a historical document for use by internal
AFI65-301_AFSCSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2014                                                            9


and external organizations. Within the Air Force, management and auditors use the final report
for reference. Outside the Air Force, government agencies such as the DoDIG, the Government
Accountability Office, and the Congress have access to the report. AFAA releases final reports
to the public, when requested, under the Freedom of Information Act.
1.10. (Added-AFSC) Tracking Audit Reports. The AFSC EIM audit database was created in
order to effectively manage each phase in the audit process. The database contains tabbed
sections that allow the AFPs to enter data associated with each phase of the audit. The binder
contains every item of audit documentation as it happens during the audit, (i.e. announcement
letter, request for management comments, draft report, final report, any and all updates). The
AFP uses the AFSC EIM audit database to document “real time” status on AFSC enterprise
audits from cradle to grave. The quality of the database hinges on the AFP’s willingness to
effectively annotate each phase of the audit as it occurs. Accurate audit documentation in the
database will allow the wing/complex/group AFPs to leverage the query function which is the
strength of the database. The AFSC EIM binder and database can be accessed at: Binder
hyperlink: ttps://cs4.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/1489/FZP_Binder/Forms/AllItems.aspx.. Database
hyperlink
   1.10.1. (Added-AFSC) All AFPs that fall under the AFSC enterprise are required to utilize
   the audit database. It is the responsibility of every AFP to ensure every audit issued from
   AFAA is properly documented in the audit database. Each tab in the AFSC EIM audit
   database represents a phase of the audit and contains information describing the status of the
   audit. The tabs are listed as:
       1.10.1.1. (Added-AFSC) Item of Interest (IOI): Current status of audit. In this tab, the
       AFP will document current phase, month, and year of audit. Data for audit fact sheet is
       retrieved from IOI tab. (Reference IOI tab sample in Attachment 4.)
       1.10.1.2. (Added-AFSC) New Announcement: Announcement of a new audit from the
       AFAA. In this tab, the AFP will document the audit title, project number, organization
       associated with the audit, binder location for audit documentation, audit objectives, audit
       focal point, date announcement received, audit point of contact (POC), phase status, type
       of audit, date of scheduled inbrief, auditor(s), and inbrief attendees. (Reference New
       Announcement tab sample in Attachment 5.)
       1.10.1.3. (Added-AFSC) Planning and Research: Actions performed by the auditor to
       determine if an actual audit is warranted for the subject matter. In this tab, the AFP will
       document any collateral engagements that may be needed to complete planning and
       research phase, pre-audit collaboration, and limiting factors that could affect the
       execution or outcome of the audit. (Reference Planning and Research tab sample in
       Attachment 6.)
       1.10.1.4. (Added-AFSC) In-Progress: Once the planning and research phase begins,
       the AFP will use this tab to document the date inbrief conducted and date when audit
       field work occurred. The last day of audit field work is identified in the “Scope”
       paragraph of the draft report of audit (ROA). (Reference In Progress tab sample in
       Attachment 7.)
       1.10.1.5. (Added-AFSC) Draft: Once the draft ROA has been issued, the AFP will use
       this tab to document the Senior Officer Communication and Coordination Electronic
10                                          AFI65-301_AFSCSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2014


     Response (SOCCER) number, draft report date, comments due date, extension date (if
     applicable), extension request comments (if applicable), organization POC for
     management comments, management comments estimated completion date (ECD), and
     open recommendations. The SOCCER number can be obtained prior to the draft ROA
     being issued for those units utilizing the SOCCER system. Management comments are
     due 30 days after the draft ROA is published. (Reference Draft tab sample in
     Attachment 8.)
     1.10.1.6. (Added-AFSC) Final: Once the final report is issued, the AFP will use this
     tab to document the final audit report number, date of final report, condition statement
     from the ROA, status of corrective actions (if applicable), ECD for management actions,
     management actions taken, final management comments, PMB identified in the report,
     actual PMB realized, date audit closed, date file should be moved to the Electronic
     Records Management System (ERMS), status of audit (Open/Closed), and local remarks.
     (Reference Final tab sample in Attachment 9.)
     1.10.1.7. (Added-AFSC) Follow-Up: A local follow-up on the audit will be conducted
     120 days after the last recommendation has been closed. The follow-up is an internal
     action that allows the affected organization(s) to re-examine management actions taken to
     ensure their effectiveness. The audit POC identified in Tab 2, New Announcement,
     cannot be the POC for the follow-up. However, a fellow colleague, not involved with
     implementing the original audit recommendations, may conduct the follow-up. The
     follow-up report will be used by the AFP to report to leadership any completed
     management actions that did not mitigate the deficiency identified during the audit. The
     AFP will use this tab to document issues identified during the follow-up that warrant
     leadership attention, date the follow-up was conducted, POC responsible for reporting
     and implementing actions required to resolve deficiencies during the follow-up phase,
     date unresolved deficiencies completed, and date audit retired. (Reference Follow-Up tab
     sample in Attachment 10.)
     1.10.1.8. (Added-AFSC) Binder: All audit documentation is filed for complete audit
     records electronically. When the new announcement letter data is entered into the
     database, the AFP will be asked if they want to create a documentation folder. Click on
     the blue square (documentation folder) and answer okay. The documentation folder will
     automatically be made. If any problems exist, you may have entered too many
     dots/periods in the Project Number or Sequence Number field.
     1.10.1.9. (Added-AFSC) Training: Training for the EIM site has been provided to all
     eight wings under AFSC. Upon notification of a new Wing AFP or alternate, training
     will be arranged. Please notify the AFSC AFP of any and all changes. EIM site training
     takes about one hour.

                                          Chapter 2

                               ACCESS TO INFORMATION

2.1. Overview. Air Force management grants AFAA auditors access to information according
to AFPD 65-3. This chapter provides guidance for resolving access-related disagreements.
2.2. Elevation of Disagreements.
   2.2.1. If an installation refuses to allow access to needed information, the auditor sends
   written notice to the AFAA representative who attempts to resolve the issue with the
   MAJCOM OPR. If discussions with the MAJCOM OPR do not result in access to requested
   information within 5 work days of the disagreement, the AFAA representative forwards the
   request and the MAJCOM position to SAF/AGA, for immediate action.
   2.2.2. If management denies access for an Air Force-level audit and the AFAA directorate
   does not resolve the issue, the applicable Assistant Auditor General forwards the request and
   the results of any discussions to SAF/AGA, for immediate action.
2.3. HQ USAF Discussions. SAF/AGA refers access disagreements to the HQ USAF OPR for
review and possible resolution. If these discussions do not resolve the problem within
15 calendar days of the disagreement, SAF/AGA refers the request, along with MAJCOM and
HQ USAF positions, to SAF/AG who submits the package to the Secretary of the Air Force
(SECAF) for decision.
2.4. SECAF Decision. The SECAF makes a decision on the access denial within 30 calendar
days of the disagreement and advises applicable Air Force activities of the decision. In
accordance with provisions of DOD Instruction 7600.02, Audit Policies, SECAF advises the
DoDIG when the SECAF denies access to AFAA auditors.
2.5. Access to Joint Staff Information. Requests for joint information should be coordinated
through SAF/AGA (HQ AFAA/DOO) and DoDIG. Pursuant to the Inspector General Act of
1978, as amended, the Joint Staff must either provide access to the information or forward a
recommendation for denial to the Secretary of Defense for a determination within 30 calendar
days.
 12                                           AFI65-301_AFSCSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2014


                                          Chapter 3

                      NONCONCURRENCES (DISAGREEMENTS)

3.1. Required Resolution. Air Force management and audit officials must resolve all
disagreements within 6 months of the final report date according to AFPD 65-4, Followup on
Internal Air Force Audit Reports and Liaison with External Audit Organizations. Management
and audit must try to resolve any disagreements at the lowest management level possible. If they
cannot resolve the problem, AFAA must move the issues to the next higher level of authority,
where they will discuss and resolve the disagreements.
3.2. Final Air Force-Level Reports with Disagreements. SAF/AGA (HQ AFAA/DOO) refers
final reports to SAF/FMP for resolution whenever disagreements exist between the AFAA and
management officials. SAF/FMP submits final reports with unresolved issues to the Under
Secretary of the Air Force (SAF/US) for final resolution. See AFI 65-403, Follow-up on
Internal Air Force Audit Reports, for additional information.
3.3. Nonconcurrences with Installation-Level Reports. If local auditors and management
officials disagree on matters in a report and they cannot resolve the disagreement, the auditors
will prepare and issue the final report containing management’s non-responsive comments and
an audit rebuttal. The auditors will send the report within 5 work days to the AFAA MAJCOM
representative for resolution with the MAJCOM functional OPR.
   3.3.1. The MAJCOM OPR will evaluate the audit and local management positions and
   provide written comments to the AFAA MAJCOM representative and installation officials
   within 60 calendar days explaining the MAJCOM position.
       3.3.1.1. When MAJCOM supports the audit position, the OPR can, with AFAA
       representative concurrence, include proposed alternative actions to correct the problem.
       3.3.1.2. When MAJCOM supports the management position, the AFAA representative
       will evaluate the MAJCOM position and either close out the disagreement or elevate it to
       SAF/AGA for resolution.
   3.3.2. When elevating a disagreement for resolution, the AFAA MAJCOM representative
   will send SAF/AGA a copy of the report, applicable management comments, the MAJCOM
   written position, and other information derived from previous resolution efforts within 90
   calendar days of the final report date. The AFAA MAJCOM representative will advise the
   MAJCOM OPR of this action.
   3.3.3. Working with HQ USAF, SAF/AGA may take an additional 90 calendar days to
   resolve the nonconcurrence. The SAF/AGA representative will evaluate the HQ USAF OPR
   position and either close out the nonconcurrence or elevate through SAF/FMP for a final
   decision.
   3.3.4. SAF/US is the final resolution authority. While SAF/US has delegated authority to
   decide nonconcurrences in installation-level issues to SAF/FMP, management or AFAA can
   appeal the SAF/FMP decision to SAF/US.
AFI65-301_AFSCSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2014                                                            13


3.4. Late or Not Received Management Comments.
   3.4.1. Air Force-Level Reports. If management does not provide comments for Air Force-
   level reports by the last revised due date (not to exceed 60 calendar days from the date of
   draft report issuance), the AFAA audit team, in coordination with SAF/AGA, will contact the
   Air Force action officer weekly to discuss (a) problems encountered, (b) the potential for
   resolution, and (c) the estimated date to receive signed comments. After 75 calendar days,
   the applicable Assistant Auditor General may get involved to resolve the problems delaying
   receipt of management comments. After 90 calendar days, the AFAA may issue the final
   report without management comments and submit the report to SAF/FMP for resolution in
   accordance with paragraph 3.3.
   3.4.2. Installation-Level Reports. If management does not provide comments to the draft
   report within 30 calendar days, the AFAA audit team will meet with unit officials to
   determine the specific cause for the delay and, if appropriate, provide additional time for unit
   officials to prepare their response. If management comments are not received after
   60 calendar days, the AFAA will issue the final report without management comments.
      3.4.2.1. If it becomes necessary to issue a final report without management comments,
      the MAJCOM OPR must act immediately to ensure the subordinate unit commander
      responds to the audit report. If the unit commander provides comments within
      30 calendar days after the final report date, AFAA will evaluate the comments. If the
      comments are responsive (either concurrences or nonconcurrences), AFAA will reissue
      the final report with the management comments and AFAA evaluation inserted. If the
      comments are not responsive, AFAA will send the comments to the AFAA MAJCOM
      Representative for resolution in accordance with paragraph 3.3. Concurrently, the unit
      audit focal point will provide the comments to the MAJCOM audit focal point to
      facilitate the resolution process.
      3.4.2.2. If the AFAA receives no comments within 30 calendar days following the final
      report date, the AFAA will, within 5 work days, elevate the report to the AFAA
      MAJCOM Representative for resolution. If not done previously, the unit audit focal
      point will elevate the report to the MAJCOM audit focal point for resolution.

                                           Chapter 4

                           POTENTIAL MONETARY BENEFITS

4.1. Definition. Potential monetary benefits:
   4.1.1. Are an estimate the AFAA measures and expresses as a dollar value and expects the
   DOD or the Federal Government overall to save if management implements audit
   recommendations.
   4.1.2. Represent the best estimate or an actual known amount at the time the auditor
   prepared the audit report.
   4.1.3. Can be either funds put to better use or questioned cost, but not both.
4.2. Funds Put to Better Use. Most PMB resulting from internal audit are classified as “funds
put to better use.” “Funds put to better use” means that if management implements the audit
recommendations, funds could be used to meet other requirements. The following list shows
examples of actions that result in “funds put to better use”:
   4.2.1. Reductions in outlays.
   4.2.2. Allowing funds from programs or operations to be deobligated and used in programs
   or operations other than that for which they were originally budgeted.
   4.2.3. Withdrawal of interest subsidy costs on loans or loan guarantees, insurance, or bonds.
   4.2.4. Costs avoided by implementing recommended improvements for the operations of the
   establishment, a contractor, or a grantee.
   4.2.5. Avoiding unnecessary spending noted in pre-award reviews of contract or grant
   agreements.
   4.2.6. Reduction to any requirement with an ongoing or planned procurement.
4.3. Questioned Cost. When an auditor questions an incurred cost because of one of the
following factors, it is known as “questioned cost”:
   4.3.1. An alleged violation of a provision of a law, regulation, contract, grant, cooperative
   agreement, or other agreement or document that governs the expenditure of funds.
   4.3.2. A cost that, at the time of the audit, is not supported by adequate documentation.
   4.3.3. An expenditure of funds that is unnecessary or unreasonable for the intended purpose
   (applicable to incurred cost audits, such as those for defective pricing on defense contracts).
4.4. Disallowed Cost. When management, in a management decision, sustains or agrees a
questioned cost should not be charged to the government, it is known as a “disallowed cost”
(applicable to incurred cost audits, such as those for defective pricing on defense contracts).
4.5. Computation. Auditors compute estimated monetary benefits from the most reasonable
data available. Actual monetary benefits are often impossible or impractical to determine.
Therefore, auditors base estimates on generally accepted principles, models, or formulas. For
example, AFAA auditors use the lower limit when expressing a single amount for a statistically
projected range of values.
AFI65-301_AFSCSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2014                                                            15


   4.5.1. Monetary benefit computations include any appropriate offset costs. Offset costs
   include all direct or indirect costs incurred in implementing the action that will result in the
   monetary benefit.
   4.5.2. PMB can be one-time or annual. Annual benefits recur for an indefinite period of
   time, but AFAA limits computations to a 6-year period; that is, the current year plus five.
4.6. Coordination. AFAA personnel coordinate PMB amounts of $50,000 or more with the
audited organization during the normal draft report discussion period.
4.7. Summary of Audit Results (SAR) Statement. The AFAA attaches a SAR statement to
each draft report given to management. The SAR statement explains PMB of $50,000 or more.
The report will normally explain PMB amounts of less than $50,000, or management can ask for
an explanation from the auditor. The amount included in the SAR statement will agree with the
amount in the report.
4.8. Management Response.
   4.8.1. Management can agree or disagree with the estimated PMB in reports of audit.
   However, management should not disagree with the audit estimate solely to defer the
   decision until actual benefits materialize.
   4.8.2. Management should comment on the reasonableness of the auditor's estimate and
   must justify disagreements with evidence that supports an alternate estimate.
4.9. Reporting Potential Monetary Benefits. AFAA includes all PMB in the Semi-Annual
Report to the Congress and the Follow-up Status Report.

                                           Chapter 5

                          NONAPPROPRIATED FUND AUDITS

5.1. Nonappropriated Fund Audit Requirements.
   5.1.1. HQ Air Force Services Agency (AFSVA) arranges for annual financial audits of
   central NAF instrumentalities and individual NAF activities with annual revenues or
   expenses exceeding $7 million. Groups of activities, such as the installation Morale,
   Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) Fund, are not subject to this audit requirement even if
   revenues or expenses exceed $7 million. However, individual entities in an MWR Fund
   (installation, MAJCOM, or Air Force) with annual revenues or expenses exceeding
   $7 million must have annual financial audits. Exceptions to these audit requirements must be
   approved by the DoDIG.
   5.1.2. Annual audits are also required for highly sensitive situations, such as potential fraud
   or large public exposure. Other audits, as deemed necessary by management and the Air
   Force Services Audit Committee (paragraph 5.2), are conducted based on assessed risk and
   resource availability.
   5.1.3. ANG NAF activities that are properly approved, operated in accordance with ANG
   regulations, and receive no appropriated fund support need not undergo an audit by federal
   entities or audits contracted by those entities.
5.2. Air Force Services Audit Committee. Air Force will establish and maintain an audit
committee made up of senior officials independent of NAF management to oversee audits of
NAF activities. The audit committee shall establish requirements for all NAF audits and base the
requirements upon the application of risk assessments. The Auditor General of the Air Force
will serve as an advisor to the audit committee, but shall not be part of the committee.
5.3. Audit Coverage of Nonappropriated Fund Activities.
   5.3.1. Public Accountant Audits. Each year, NAFs are budgeted and approved for certified
   public accountant firms to audit Air Force NAF activities. The audit committee shall
   establish requirements and identify contract deliverables for the public accountant audits and
   assist in monitoring the conduct of financial statement audits. Certified public accountant
   audit responsibilities are listed in Attachment 3, Section A3B.
   5.3.2. AFAA Audits. In addition to the public accountant audits, the AFAA performs audits
   of NAF activities. Much like the Air Force Inspector General and other appropriated fund
   organizations, AFAA is considered “oversight” and the use of AFAA is authorized to provide
   audit support to NAF activities. Moreover, audit is a necessary component of oversight to
   ensure Air Force resources are properly and efficiently used to support NAF activities.
   Accordingly, AFAA “oversight” audits will be performed without NAF reimbursement. The
   AFAA:
       5.3.2.1. Does not have internally or externally established NAF limits of audit coverage.
       The AFAA schedules and performs NAF audits as deemed appropriate.
       5.3.2.2. Includes Air Force-wide system and functional reviews of NAF activities in the
       AFAA annual audit plan when appropriate.
AFI65-301_AFSCSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2014                                                            17


       5.3.2.3. Includes installation-level audits of NAF activities in area audit office annual
       audit plans, based on audit priorities.
       5.3.2.4. Notifies HQ AFSVA of planned audits on NAF activities to avoid duplicate
       audits.
       5.3.2.5. Provides copies of installation-level reports on NAF activities to the installation
       audit focal point, HQ AFSVA/SVFR, SAF/FMCEB, and the applicable MAJCOM audit
       focal point.
       5.3.2.6. Should be used for audits of NAF activities involving suspected fraud and other
       serious improprieties rather than public accountants.
5.4. Audits of Private Organizations. The Air Force does not provide appropriated funds,
NAFs, or personnel supported by these funds to audit private organizations such as museum
foundations, thrift shops, Air Force Aid Societies, scouting groups, spouses’ clubs, and
auxiliaries on Air Force installations, unless authorized by the SECAF. When indications of
fraud or other improprieties exist, regardless of the amount of revenues, the commander can
request an AFAA audit to protect Air Force interest.
5.5. Processing Public Accountant Reports. The Public Accountant Contract Audit (PACA)
program requires public accountants to issue a separate report for each audit.
   5.5.1. Reporting Level. The PACA program requires public accountants to prepare and
   distribute NAF activity reports based on the terms of the contract.
       5.5.1.1. When findings and recommendations are system-wide or procedural, public
       accountants consolidate installation-level audit results and issue a report to HQ AFSVA
       which will work with the appropriate oversight board or committee to correct any
       deficiencies.
       5.5.1.2. Public accountants should promptly report any findings that suggest irregular
       conduct or the possibility of fraud to the Air Force Services Agency, Contract Audit
       Management Office, and the installation’s servicing Air Force Office of Special
       Investigations (AFOSI) detachment.
   5.5.2. Management Comments. Commanders of audited activities prepare management
   comments for each finding and recommendation in the audit report and give them to the
   public accountant firm within 35 calendar days (50 days for overseas) from the date they
   receive the draft audit report.
   5.5.3. Evaluation of Management Comments. In the installation-level report, public
   accountants evaluate the responsiveness and adequacy of management comments for each
   finding and recommendation. They state whether the actions taken or planned respond to the
   recommendations and if any alternative management actions correct the reported deficiency.
   When public accountants evaluate management comments as nonresponsive, the accountant
   explains why management actions are inadequate. These evaluations follow each
   management response in the final report.
   5.5.4. Report Distribution. The contract quality assurance evaluator normally receives and
   distributes the public accountant report to the following:
       5.5.4.1. Installation commander.
 18                                            AFI65-301_AFSCSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2014


       5.5.4.2. Local audit focal point.
       5.5.4.3. Manager of the activity audited.
       5.5.4.4. Servicing AFAA area audit office and AFOSI detachment.
       5.5.4.5. NAF Accounting Office.
       5.5.4.6. Base liaison between FM and SV (usually the NAF Financial Analyst).
   5.5.5. Command Review. MAJCOM Services staffs review public accountant reports,
   advise activity commanders on preparing management comments, suggest or direct
   corrective actions where necessary, and monitor implementation of corrective actions.
   HQ AFSVA also periodically crossfeeds internal control weaknesses, findings, and
   recommendations that public accountants identify during audits to Services
   Commanders/Division Chiefs within the Air Force.
   5.5.6. Resolution of Nonconcurrences. SAF/FM works with HQ AFSVA and the
   appropriate oversight board or committee to resolve disagreements with findings or
   recommendations in public accountant audit reports that cannot be resolved at MAJCOM
   level. If SAF/FM cannot resolve the disagreements, they follow policy in AFPD 65-4. The
   resolution period is 6 months from the date the public accountant issues the report.
5.6. Processing Air Force Audit Agency Audit Reports. AFAA addresses, processes, and
distributes reports on NAF activities according to the requirements detailed in Chapter 1 of this
instruction. AFAA reports on NAF activities receive management follow-up attention as
specified in AFPD 65-4.

Terms

Audit Focal Point (AFP)—Liaison between AFAA and the wing/complex/staff office.

Closed Recommendation—The status of a recommendation when cognizant managers give
explicit written confirmation that management has completed all corrective actions or received
on-site verification for completed actions. Follow-up files must contain all confirmation
documents. Authorized officials may not close audit recommendations until management
completes all corrective actions and documents realized monetary benefits, when applicable.

Follow-Up Program—A program ensuring that management implements agreed-on audit
recommendations, corrects agreed-on deficiencies and, if applicable, documents realized
monetary benefits. The follow-up program officially begins when the audit is published and
 22                                            AFI65-301_AFSCSUP_I 11 FEBRUARY 2014


ends when management gives explicit written confirmation that the corrective action or on-site
verification is complete.

Funds Put to Better Use—The financial impact of an audit recommendation. Funds that
organizations could use more efficiently if management takes action to implement an audit
recommendation. The vast majority of PMBs resulting from internal audits fall into this
category. Examples are reducing outlays; deobligating funds from program or operations;
withdrawing interest subsidy costs on loans or loan guarantees, insurance, or bonds;
implementing recommended cost-saving improvements related to operations of the establishment,
a contractor, or grantee; avoiding unnecessary expenditures noted in preaward reviews of
contract or grant agreements; or gaining any other specifically identified savings. Calculate
these savings on the basis of statistical projections, when appropriate.

Potential Monetary Benefits—Questioned costs or funds put to better use.

Realized Monetary Benefits—The measurable and documented amount of monetary benefits
actually achieved after the cognizant manager has completed corrective actions. Documentation
normally includes references to official budget and accounting data. If such documentation isn’t
feasible, managers may use an update estimate and its rationale as support for the realized
amount. Management considers monetary benefits that are associated with specific
recommendations as closed (actually realized) after the cognizant manager completes the related
corrective actions and furnishes explicit written confirmation of the amount actually realized.
