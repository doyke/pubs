                                          GENERAL

1.1. Scope and Purpose.
   1.1.1. The purpose of this instruction is to establish procedures to govern all vehicle
   operations on the airfield. Only trained personnel will be assigned duties that include driving
   on the airfield. Trained personnel must have the necessary knowledge base to comply with
   this instruction. The use of vehicles on the airfield will be limited to the absolute minimum
   necessary to accomplish the mission. Safe operation of vehicles on the airfield is absolutely
   essential to normal aircraft operations and maintenance.
   1.1.2. Vehicles present a clear and definite danger to both aircraft and ground personnel.
   Carelessness, haste, and a disregard for established safety standards are major factors in
   aircraft/vehicle collisions, incidents, and personal injuries. Airfield drivers must be familiar
   with the provisions of this instruction and exercise their best judgment if they encounter
   situations that are not covered by published guidance.

   3.4.7. Personnel who lose their KAFB Form 610 and still have a valid AF IMT 483 for
   KAFB may be recertified to drive on airfield by the unit ADPM. The ADPM will complete a
   new KAFB Form 610 and make a statement on the form to indicate it is a replacement for a
   lost original and verify all training requirements are current.
   3.4.8. Runway access will only be allowed when mission requirements dictate and will be
   annotated on the AF IMT 483 when issued. All other personnel will have an AF IMT 483
   with restrictions annotated on the AF IMT 483 (e.g., PARKING RAMP ONLY). Personnel
   with an AF IMT 483 before the date of this instruction will be ―grandfathered until annual
   refresher training is due. After completing annual refresher training all personnel will be
   issued a license with the appropriate restrictions by Airfield Management.
       3.4.8.1. Personnel with restrictions will coordinate with the ADPM and AMOPS for a
       new AF IMT 483 when access to additional areas is required.

                     OPERATING PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS

4.1. Operating Procedures and Standards.
   4.1.1. All ground vehicles will comply with the airfield driving procedures outlined in this
   instruction and AFMAN 24-306, Chapter 25.
   4.1.2. All personnel operating a vehicle on the KAFB airfield will have a valid AF IMT 483,
   issued by AM with the appropriate endorsement stamped on it, or be escorted by a vehicle
   driver possessing a valid AF IMT 483 prior to entry to the airfield, except as identified in this
   instruction (i.e., TDY personnel).
   4.1.3. Personnel operating within any CMA area will have two-way radio contact with
   Albuquerque Control Tower at all times.
   4.1.4. Two-way radio is the only means of communications with Air Traffic Control (ATC)
   personnel while operating in the CMA. Correct terminology will be used when talking to
   ATC personnel over radios. Light gun signals will only be used due to radio failure.
   4.1.5. Vehicles without contact with ATC will not enter any CMA. See Attachment 2.
   4.1.6. If following a taxiline entering a restricted area or CMA into which the operator
   cannot obtain approval to drive, the operator will continue along the side of the area
   (remaining outside the CMA) until intersecting another usable taxi line or entry control point.
   4.1.7. Vehicles will stop and yield the right-of-way to all emergency response vehicles
   responding to emergencies. NOTE: During an emergency all non-response vehicle traffic
   should cease to the maximum extent possible.
   4.1.8. During an aircraft accident/incident, all vehicles not directly involved with emergency
   response will immediately exit the affected area, and proceed to a location of at least 2,000
   feet away from the area unless otherwise directed by the on scene commander.
   4.1.9. All vehicle operators will yield to taxiing or towed aircraft. Drivers will not drive in
   front of taxiing aircraft or between a “Follow-Me” vehicle and an aircraft, or between an
   aircraft marshaller and the aircraft they are marshalling.
   4.1.10. Do not enter barricaded airfield construction sites. The barricades are set up to keep
   personnel and vehicles out of hazardous areas and allow for pavement cure times.
   4.1.11. Procedures for vehicles equipped with supplemental traction devices. Note: To
   reduce spark producing potential, only non-sparking materials can be used.
      4.1.11.1. Tire chains may only be used on airfield pavements after obtaining
      coordination/approval from Airfield Manager, Wing Safety, and Civil Engineering. The
      requesting agency will conduct a risk assessment with the above agencies when
      evaluating the need for tire chains to minimize pavement damage and FOD.
      4.1.11.2. Vehicles equipped with studded tires are not permitted to operate on the airfield
      without prior coordination with the Airfield Manager, Wing Safety, Civil Engineer,
      Transportation, and installation commander approval.

4.2. Airfield Vehicle Traffic Flow.
   4.2.1. Standard traffic flow will be observed at all times. Vehicles will proceed on the
   extreme right hand side of all taxiways and movement areas giving way to aircraft and
   emergency vehicles at all times.
   4.2.2. Operators of vehicles and servicing equipment will approach aircraft so that the
   operator’s side is adjacent to the aircraft (driver’s side door to the aircraft).
   4.2.3. All vehicles operating on the airfield will utilize the airfield access roads designated
   on the pavement to the maximum extent possible.
   4.2.4. Perimeter access roads are restricted to specific agencies; crash, fire and rescue, fuels
   (POL), ambulance, Transient Alert (TA), SFS, NMANG, Auxiliary Ground Equipment
   (AGE), sweeper, and Airfield Management personnel. These roads are designed to reduce
   the amount of vehicle traffic on the taxiways and taxi lanes.
4.3. Airfield Speed Limits.
   4.3.1. Only emergency response vehicles responding to an actual emergency may exceed
   speed limits. Those agencies responding to an emergency and exceeding the speed limit will
   take into account the current road conditions (nighttime, precipitation present) and adjust
   their speed accordingly.
   4.3.2. The following are the airfield speed limits:
       4.3.2.1. General Purpose Vehicles....................15 MPH
       4.3.2.2. Special Purpose Vehicles.....................10 MPH
       4.3.2.3. AGE Towing Single Units...................10 MPH
       4.3.2.4. AGE Towing Multi Units..................... 5 MPH
   4.3.2.5. Within 25 feet of Aircraft......................5 MPH
4.4. Operations in Vicinity of Aircraft (See Attachment 4).
   4.4.1. All vehicles will approach a parked aircraft with the driver’s side of the vehicle
   toward the aircraft.
   4.4.2. Except for servicing operations, no vehicle will stop, park, or be driven closer than 25
   feet to the front or side of an aircraft, or less than 200 feet from the rear of an aircraft whose
   engines are running or about to be started. For larger aircraft i.e., C5, 747, drivers should
   increase the distance to 500 feet from the rear of the aircraft.
   4.4.3. Do not drive vehicles within 10 feet of a parked aircraft, except when the aircraft is
   being serviced, loaded, or off-loaded. Use spotters to guide the vehicle’s approach to the
   aircraft during loading operations.
   4.4.4. Never drive vehicles under any part of the aircraft. Do not drive any vehicles directly
   toward any aircraft, except as authorized in certain loading, unloading, or fueling operations.
   In these cases, place pre-positioned wheel chocks between the aircraft and the approaching
   vehicle to keep vehicles from striking the aircraft. Post guides as a required safety measure.
   Keep chocks in position until vehicles leave from within the 10-foot safety distance
   requirement.
KIRTLANDAFBI13-201 5 MARCH 2013                                                                19


   4.4.5. Vehicles will not operate in the fuel servicing safety zone unless authorized for
   concurrent servicing component (i.e., servicing hose, fuel nozzle single-point receptacle,
   hydrant cart, ramp hydrant connection point) and 25 feet around fuel vent outlets of aircraft.
   The fuel servicing safety zone is established and maintained during pressurization and
   movement of fuel.
4.5. Vehicle Parking Requirements.
   4.5.1. When parking on the airfield the following standards will be followed:
      4.5.1.1. The vehicles engine will be turned off with the keys left in the ignition, with the
      doors unlocked.
      4.5.1.2. Select reverse (standard shift) or park (automatic). Hand brake or parking brake
      will be set. Chocks will be used when the vehicle does not have an integral braking
      system.
      4.5.1.3. When in the vicinity of an aircraft parked vehicles will have the driver’s side
      toward the aircraft.
   4.5.2. In the event a vehicle should become disabled, move the vehicle at least 200 feet from
   taxiway centerline. At least 125 feet from aircraft parking apron, leave exterior flashing
   lights on, and remain with the vehicle. Attempt to flag down a passing vehicle or contact
   AM at 846-8335/6 as soon as possible.
   4.5.3. All motor vehicles will use emergency flashers when parked on the airfield during the
   hours of darkness or inclement weather.
   4.5.4. Do not park or pre-position vehicles adjacent to refueling pits while aircraft are being
   taxied or towed into the pit complex.
   4.5.5. Emergency vehicles may be left unattended with engine running (if absolutely
   necessary) at the emergency site, but must select park (neutral for manual transmissions), set
   hand brake, and use chocks.
4.6. Vehicle Chocking Requirements.
   4.6.1. All vehicles and wheeled equipment which do not have integral braking systems when
   they are left parked and unattended on a ramp will have one wheel chocked.
   4.6.2. Vehicles used in loading operations will be chocked to prevent their movement and
   possible collision with aircraft.
   4.6.3. Vehicles with mobile ramp steps need not be chocked if the driver remains at the
   wheel and exercises extreme caution. NOTE: Mobile ramp steps are considered to be
   chocked when the stabilizers are in the “down” position.
4.7. Procedures for operating a vehicle in the CMA.
   4.7.1. No vehicle or person may enter the CMA without specific approval from ATC.
   4.7.2. Identify procedures for emergency removal of vehicles in the event of vehicle/control
   tower radio failure.
   4.7.3. Vehicles operating in the CMA must use rotating beacon lights or emergency flashers.

4.8. Phraseology Training.
   4.8.1. It’s up to every individual talking on the radio to ensure transmissions are done in a
   professional manner, because slang, Citizen Band (CB) jargon, and incorrect radio
   procedures can compromise safety.           One of the most important items in radio
   communications is for you to speak in a manner ensuring others understand what you have
   said.
   4.8.2. Radio Operations. Before depressing the microphone button to talk, first think of what
   you will say. Radio transmissions should be brief and clear. Ensure someone else is not
   already talking on the frequency or waiting for a response.
   4.8.3. Phraseology. Due to the high risk involved with operating vehicles in the vicinity of
   aircraft taking off and landing, phraseology plays a key role during radio communications
   with ATC, in keeping personnel and equipment safe. Every driver operating a vehicle in the
   CMA or communicating via radio will be trained on the following phrases:

Table 4.1. Phraseology
                  Verify                      Please confirm
                  Say again                   Repeat

                  Standby                     Wait
                  Words twice                 Repeat every word again (twice)
                  Acknowledge                 I copy and understand

                                              correct way
                  Go Ahead                    Proceed with message

                  Wilco                       Understood message and will be
                                              complied with
   4.8.4. The phonetic alphabet was developed to avoid misunderstanding of communications.
   Because letters such as "B," "C," "D," and "E" all have similar sounds, they can easily be
   mistaken for one another, especially during radio transmissions. The following is the
   phonetic alphabet:
KIRTLANDAFBI13-201 5 MARCH 2013                                                               21


Figure 4.1. Phonetic Alphabet




   4.8.5. Use a two-way radio capable of communicating with ATC. Each vehicle must have a
   unique call sign identifying the vehicle (i.e., no two vehicles will have the same call sign).
   Use the proper sequence in calling the tower.
   4.8.6. Before you start talking, make sure no one else is already talking and or waiting for a
   reply. Then key your microphone and do the following:
      4.8.6.1. State whom you are calling and identify yourself by using your vehicle call sign.
      For example, “Albuquerque tower, vehicle 1.” Table 4.3 lists approved call signs.

Table 4.2. Approved Call Signs
             Call Sign                            Owning Unit

             FSO1 & 2                             Flight Medicine
   4.8.7. Wait for ATC to respond. Be patient, as it sometimes takes a while if the controller is
   busy. When the controller responds, “Vehicle 1, Albuquerque tower,” state where you are
   and where you want to go. For example: “Vehicle 1 on Alpha 6, Request permission onto
   runway 26.” NOTE: The order in which you state where you are and where you are going

   is unimportant. For example, “Vehicle 1 requests permission onto runway 26 from taxiway
   A6.” The important thing to remember is both pieces of information are required, where you
   are and where you’re going.
   4.8.8. Wait for the controller’s response. The controller will either approve or deny your
   request, or give you modified instructions. For example, “Vehicle 1, proceed onto runway 26.
   Report when off.”
       4.8.8.1. ALWAYS read back instructions from the tower. For example: “Vehicle 1
       proceeding onto runway 26. Will report when off.”
   4.8.9. All non-radio equipped vehicles operating within the CMA will be escorted by a two-
   way radio-equipped vehicle monitoring the ATC frequency at all times.
   4.8.10. The escort is responsible to ensure positive control of all vehicles/personnel under
   his/her escort while operating in the CMA, and shall not leave the immediate vicinity.
   4.8.11. The escort will inform ATC of the number of vehicles under escort when requesting
   clearance on the CMA and again if crossing or requesting on the runway.
   4.8.12. The escort will ensure all vehicles clear the runway or controlled area at the nearest
   exit, when directed by tower.
   4.8.13. The escort shall ensure all vehicles and FOD are clear of the CMA and/or runway
   prior to reporting off.
   4.8.14. Use extreme caution when you hear the phrase “go ahead.” Tower controllers use
   this to mean “state your request.” It NEVER means “proceed.”
   4.8.15. Avoid use of the word “CLEAR” when reporting off the CMA or runway(s). This
   word is reserved for pilots and air traffic controllers only.
   4.8.16. Use same procedures for any closed portion of CMA or runway(s).
   4.8.17. During emergencies stay off the ATC frequency, unless absolutely necessary.
4.9. Vehicle Decals and Diagrams.
   4.9.1. All vehicles that operate on the airfield will contain the following AFVA/decals and
   diagrams: Note: Decals may be permanently affixed in plain view of the driver or clipped to
   the inside of the sun visor on the driver’s side of the vehicle so it can be flipped down for
   ready reference:
       4.9.1.1. AFVA 11-240
       4.9.1.2. AFVA 13-221
       4.9.1.3. AFVA 13-222
       4.9.1.4. A current locally developed airfield diagram (provided by DAFM).
4.10. Cell Phone Use on the Airfield.
   4.10.1. Cell phones will not be used while driving on the airfield.
   4.10.2. Cell phones should not be used during aircraft servicing unless specified in the
   appropriate Technical Order or guidance for the particular operation being conducted. Cell
   phones should not be used:
KIRTLANDAFBI13-201 5 MARCH 2013                                                            23


     4.10.2.1. Within 50 feet of any pressurized aircraft fuel or oxygen servicing components.
     4.10.2.2. Within 25 feet of any aircraft fuel vent outlet during fuel transfer.
     4.10.2.3. Within 10 feet of any aircraft fuel vent outlet at any time.

7.1. Airfield Markings, Signs, and Lighting (see Attachment 3)
   7.1.1. Taxiway centerlines are solid yellow lines. The runway centerline is a large dashed
   white line.
   7.1.2. Hold lines are indicated by two solid yellow lines parallel to two dashed yellow
   parallel lines. These lines indicate that a runway is ahead. The markings are approximately
   125 feet from the runway edge and are located at the intersection of each taxiway and
   runway.

Figure 7.1. Hold Lines




   7.1.3. The hold line indicating the CMA on the Helo pads (between Delta and Expire
   Ramps) consist of two solid yellow lines parallel to two dashed yellow parallel lines.
   Individuals must have 2-way communications with the Control Tower to enter.
   7.1.4. Instrument hold lines are indicated by two solid yellow parallel lines with
   perpendicular lines at intervals between (similar to a ladder). These lines are utilized to stop
   aircraft and vehicles from interfering with the signal of the Instrument Landing System (ILS).
   Albuquerque Control Tower has ultimate authority over all traffic entering the CMA and will
   issue, by radio specific instructions which approve or disapprove the movement of aircraft,
   vehicles, equipment, or personnel on the movement area.

Figure 7.2. Instrument Hold Lines




   7.1.5. Restricted areas are identified by a solid red line or a red rope with rubber donuts, or
   both. Be alert for warning signs around these areas. Entry/exit into restricted areas can only
   be made through the Entry Control Points (ECP). Entrance is limited to those personnel
   authorized and displaying an Air Force Entry Control Card/USAF Restricted Area Badge.
   Personnel escorting individuals into the restricted areas are responsible for the personnel
   being escorted and must keep these people in close proximity. Escorted personnel must be
   visible at all times by the escort official.
   7.1.6. At night, the taxiways lights are blue and runway lights are white.

                 RUNWAY INCURSION PREVENTION PROCEDURES

8.1. Runway Incursion Prevention Procedures.
   8.1.1. Vehicles will use the Access Road and adjacent taxiways whenever possible instead of
   crossing any runway. Only in extreme circumstances will a vehicle operator cross an active
   runway and then only after approval of ATC.
   8.1.2. Albuquerque Control Tower is responsible for the control of all vehicular traffic
   operating within the CMA/AIAO. All vehicles intending to cross active runways must have
   radio contact with and approval from Albuquerque Control Tower.
   8.1.3. Personnel crossing runways must have a working radio with the ability to
   communicate on the appropriate frequency to ATC and be sure of the instructions. Approval
   to cross a runway does not relieve an operator from visually checking for approaching
   aircraft or vehicles. Vehicles will not proceed beyond runway hold lines and instrument hold
   lines where applicable without ATC approval. To avoid a misunderstanding, the approval
   issued by the tower will be repeated.
   8.1.4. Vehicles will not cross the runway in front of landing aircraft, regardless of approval,
   until approval is reconfirmed with tower and a safe crossing is assured.
   8.1.5. These restrictions apply to all runways regardless of whether they are active or
   inactive.
   8.1.6. When directed to exit a runway, all vehicles will immediately depart the runway, and
   report to ATC that they are off the runway. Vehicles will operate their emergency
   beacon/flashers when operating on any portion of a CMA. The use of emergency
   beacon/flashers help to highlight the vehicle's location and make it easier to be detected by
   ATC personnel and aircraft.
KIRTLANDAFBI13-201 5 MARCH 2013                                                                  31

10.1. Night and Inclement Weather Operations.
   10.1.1. Flashing lights or parking lights will be used at night and during inclement weather
   when vehicles are temporarily parked on any part of the airfield. This directive does not
   apply if vehicles are parked in a designated area.
   10.1.2. Headlights of a stopped vehicle shining towards a moving aircraft at night will be
   turned off immediately so the pilot’s night vision will not be affected. The vehicle parking
   lights or emergency flashers will be turned on so its position will be known. The headlights
   of the vehicle will remain off until the aircraft is out of range. Headlights will be turned on
   prior to putting the vehicle in motion. NOTE: Vehicles with daytime running lights will
   park in a safe location with ignition off, parking brake set, and emergency flashers on.

      ACCESS TO ALBUQUERQUE INTERNATIONAL AREA OF OPERATION

11.1. Access to Albuquerque International Area of Operations (AIAO)
11.1.1. All operators of vehicles on the AIAO will have in their possession a valid AF Form
483, with “AIAO” stamped on it.
   11.1.2. Vehicles operating on the CMA will be in radio contact with the ATC or be escorted
   by a vehicle having contact with the ATC.
   11.1.3. Airfield vehicle operators are required to have two-way radio contact and permission
   from ATC to enter or drive within any CMA, and must monitor the ATC frequency at all
   times while in a CMA. Both vehicle operators and the tower controller must ensure
   communications is understood, never assume anything, and always ask for assistance when
   in doubt. If the instructions you receive from the tower are unclear, ask that they be repeated
   by stating, “Say Again.”
   11.1.4. When on any runway, turn on rotating beacon or use hazard flashing lights.
   11.1.5. Vehicle operators located near the vicinity of the runway that need access to the
   runway and overruns will stop at least 125 feet from the edge of the runway and overruns and
   contact control tower for permission to proceed. No vehicle or personnel will proceed closer
   than 125 feet to the edge of the runway or overrun without tower approval.
   11.1.6. Ensure entry into the runway is necessary. Runway crossing for convenience is
   strictly prohibited. Look out for aircraft and emergency vehicles and operate in a safe
   manner at all times.
   11.1.7. Contact ATC stating radio call sign, location and intentions. ATC will approve or
   disapprove request. Always follow ATC instructions and always repeat instructions back to
   ATC to ensure proper understanding. NOTE: Permission in the CMA does not
   automatically mean you have runway/taxiway access. You must stop at each hold line, and
   request permission and approval from the control tower prior to proceeding. Failure to
   obtain permission onto the runway/taxiways is a serious offense and jeopardizes human lives
   and valuable assets.

Terms
Airfield— A general term encompassing the runways, taxiways, aircraft parking ramps, access,
service, and perimeter roads, hangars, and all open areas immediately adjacent to the runways,
taxiways, and aircraft parking ramps.
Albuquerque Ground— Air Traffic Control agency controlling aircraft and vehicles on the
ground
Controlled Area— An area in which permission from the installation commander is required
before access is granted. The airfield is considered a Controlled Area. Only personnel conducting
official military business are allowed on the airfield. All personnel driving on the airfield must
possess a valid AF IMT 483.
Controlled Movement Area— Any portion of the airfield requiring aircraft, vehicles, and
pedestrians to maintain two-way radio contact with the Control Tower. The CMA encompasses
active runways, overruns, Taxiways Alpha, Foxtrot, Juliet, Interior Access Road (between the
runways) and areas within 100 feet laterally from the edge of the runway.
Critical Areas— Areas whereas safety of flight concerns are greatest. Within 100 feet of a
runway and overruns, runway primary surfaces, clear zones, within 200 feet of a taxiway, within
10 feet of a parked aircraft, or 25 feet in front of or 200 feet to the rear of an aircraft with engines
operating.

endangers an airborne aircraft or an aircraft on the ground.
Instrument Hold Lines— These markings consist of two solid yellow lines, two feet apart,
extending across the width of the taxiway, connected by pairs of solid yellow lines ten feet apart
and are used in conjunction with an instrument runway when the INST is active. This is to
protect the INST critical area so that an aircraft’s instrument reception is not disrupted while in
flight. A vehicle may not cross these lines without clearance from the Control Tower any time
the weather falls below a ceiling of 800 feet above ground level (AGL) and/or a visibility of two
statute miles and at any other time ATC deems necessary.
Movement Areas— Consists of the taxiways (excluding Twy A) and aircraft parking aprons,
where aircraft and vehicles operate without direct ATC control. Caution must be used when
operating vehicles in these areas. Note: This is NOT the same as the Controlled Movement Area
(CMA).
Privately Owned Vehicle (POV)— Any vehicle not owned or leased by the U.S. Government.
Contractor vehicles are treated as POVs.
Rental Vehicles— Rental vehicles may be operated on the airfield by personnel with a valid
POV pass and AF IMT 483.
Runway Environment— The runway, overruns, any taxiway leading to the runway beyond the
runway holdline, or within 100 feet of the runway, including grassy areas adjacent to the runway.
Runway Incursion/Controlled Movement Area Violation— Entry by an individual, on foot or
in a vehicle, into the runway environment, as defined above, without approval from the Control
Tower. All runway incursions/CMAVs will be assigned an operational category (Operational
Error, Pilot Deviation or vehicle/pedestrian).

operate on the airfield at KAFB. Airfield vehicle operations are covered in AFMAN 24-306,
Chapter 25, AFOSH Standard 91-100, and KIRTLANDAFBI 13-201, and must be strictly
complied with. Keep this letter, a copy of the airfield diagram, and a copy of your orders with
you while driving on the airfield at KAFB. Airfield driving privileges are good only for the
duration of the TDY and/or contract.

TDY/Contract personnel will have limited access to airfield. Access will be permitted only to
areas that are necessary to accomplish mission/project.

Commercial vendors requiring access to Hangars 1000, 1001, and 1002 will be escorted and
briefed by supporting unit. If a vendor’s vehicle is left on airfield, it must be parked in
designated area and must not interfere with airfield operations.

TDY personnel must possess a valid airfield driver’s license from home station in order to drive
on KAFB transient ramp. Contractors must have a valid state driver’s license, receive this
briefing and remain in designated areas specified by Airfield Management or UFDPM. Before
starting work, and after completion for the day, contractors who drive on the airfield must check
in with Airfield Management and advise of location.

All non-government owned vehicles (rentals, contract vehicles) must have a temporary vehicle
airfield pass before driving on the airfield.

Vehicles will not be driven across any movement areas (helipads) without two-way radio contact
with Albuquerque Ground Control.

Vehicles will not be driven onto Albuquerque International Airport (AIA) area
(taxiways/runways/access roads) unless project/mission dictates. If your mission requires access
onto AIA, Airfield Management Ops will brief you on additional requirements.

All vehicles operators will yield to aircraft being taxied or towed. Do not drive in front of
taxiing aircraft or between a “Follow Me” vehicle and aircraft being towed or marshaled.

All vehicle operators will approach parked aircraft with driver’s side toward aircraft and remain
at least 25 feet in front of and 200 feet behind aircraft about to start engines or have engines
running.

Vehicles will not be driven within 10 ft of parked aircraft, except servicing, loading, or off-
loading, and will not pass under any part of the aircraft. Spotters will be used to guide a

vehicle’s approach to aircraft. Vehicles will not be backed in the direction of any aircraft except
as authorized in certain towing/loading/refueling ops only when using a guide and pre-positioned
wheel chocks.

Do not leave equipment or vehicles unattended on the airfield.

Vehicles will be parked with engines off, parking brake set, transmission in gear (park of
automatic transmissions), wheels chocked, and keys left in ignition.

Conduct a FOD check prior to entering airfield.

Check tire treads for debris and secure any loose articles in truck beds. If forced to leave paved
areas, accomplish FOD check before returning to useable pavement.
