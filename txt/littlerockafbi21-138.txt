SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This change implements new responsibility for funding/maintain of GITA.
1. User Responsibilities:
   1.1. Each individual with access to training equipment is responsible to ensure its safe
   operation, configuration, integrity, and that it is used as intended.
 2                                                      LITTLEROCKAFBI21-138 9 JULY 2013


     1.2. Sign out aircraft key from the 19 MOS Maintenance Training Flight (MTF).
     1.3. Forms for the GITA will be kept in the 19 MOS MTF CTK and will be issued to users
     with the aircraft key.
     1.4. Complete a 19 MOS/MTF-provided “GITA Before/After Use Responsibilities”
     checklist with each use of GITA. See attachment 3 for sample format.
     1.5. Document and clear all maintenance actions IAW applicable 00-20 series T.Os and this
     instruction.
     1.6. Notify 19 MOS/MTF personnel if GITA systems are not operational. Provide
     information detailing suspected cause of the malfunction or schedule troubleshooting time.
     Document discrepancy in aircraft forms in accordance with applicable technical data.
     1.7. If an aircraft part is required to repair a malfunction, the user will provide a completed
     GITA Parts Request worksheet to the 19 MOS/MTF. See attachment 4 for sample format.
     1.8. When an ordered part is received, the 19 MOS/MTF will notify an instructor from the
     19 MOS/MTF or 373 TRS/Det 4 within 1 duty day. The 19 MOS/MTF or 373 TRS/Det 4
     instructors will install the part as part of their class when possible, but in a time not to exceed
     7 calendar days. Ideally, all maintenance will be performed in conjunction with classes.
     However, to avoid excessive DIFM time, parts are required to be installed within 7 calendar
     days of issue regardless of class schedule. The instructor will perform all operational and
     leak checks required in accordance with applicable technical data. All applicable tags will be
     completed for turn-in of the part when maintenance in complete.
     1.9. A maintenance instructor will review the forms for proper work procedures and
     documentation before accepting turn-in of the forms and key.
     1.10. Ensure the aircraft is correctly moored and a serviceable fire bottle is on hand.
2. Maintenance Responsibilities:
     2.1. The 19 MOS/MTF personnel will perform crew chief duties, maintain aircraft forms,
     update G081 as required, transcribe forms, and coordinate with appropriate agencies for
     specialist support when required.
        2.1.1. The 373 TRS/Det 4 instructors will assist with GITA maintenance, as instructor
        availability permits, when requested by the 19 MOS/MTF.
            2.1.1.1. Instructors are responsible for repairing any discrepancies created during
            their use of the GITA unless other arrangements are made with 19 MOS/MTF
            personnel.
        2.1.2. When specialists are unavailable through the 19/MTF, or 373 TRS/Det 4, the 19
        MOS/MTF will enter unscheduled maintenance discrepancies into G081 and notify the
        Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) of unscheduled maintenance requirements.
        When appropriate, the 19 MOS/MTF will coordinate directly with the maintenance
        provider. The    19 EMS will perform maintenance and will assist with GITA support
        when required.
     2.2. The 19 EMS Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) section will deliver AGE as needed
     by GITA users to ensure efficient use of scheduled training time.

   2.5. The 19 MXG resource advisor has responsibility for coordinating flying hour funding
   (CPFM) for required parts, supplies, and equipment to maintain the GITA in operational
   condition for training.
3. GITA Configuration:
   3.1. The 314 MOS/MTF and 373 TRS/Det 4, will provide the 19 MOS/MTF with any
   changes of utilization of systems and subsystems that must be maintained in operational
   configuration. See attachment 2 for sample format.
   3.2. GITAs will be moored at all times IAW T.O. 1C-130H-2-10JG-00-1. Any
   organization, that tows a GITA, is responsible for mooring it when placed on a parking
   location.
   3.3. A master listing of items exempted by the 19 MXG from inspection requirements will
   be reviewed annually by the 19 MOS, MTF, Plans, Scheduling and Documentation (PS&D)
   and 19th Maintenance Group Commander (19 MXG/CC). The 19 MOS/MTF will maintain
   a copy on file in the GITA continuity book.

      Day Inspection for GC130E.
      3.3.2. Due to GITA non-flyable status, aircraft tire pressure will be maintained at a
      minimum of 75 percent for aircraft minimum gross weight, but no less than 57 PSI for
      MLG and 42 for NLG regardless of minimum gross weight.
      3.3.3. Aircraft wheels will be removed and inspected by NDI every 36 months IAW T.O.
      4W-1-61, page 2-18, para 2.31.1 sub para b., (2), (3), and (4). Additionally, if the tires are
      not unserviceable IAW T.O. 4T-1-3 they shall be reused for the GITA.
   3.4. Aerospace vehicle inventory reporting of GITAs is not required for non-technical school
   training equipment IAW AFI 21-103.
4. Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 781 Series Documentation Procedures:
   4.1. Documentation of AFTO Forms 781 is the responsibility of both the using agency and
   the 19 MOS/MTF personnel. All maintenance actions, for training or actual maintenance,
   will be documented in the AFTO forms 781 IAW AFI 00-20-1 AMC Sup 1 and AFI 21-101
   AMC Sup 1 unless otherwise noted in this instruction.
      4.1.1. Maintenance performed by maintenance training personnel for training purposes
      only, will not be entered into the G081 system. A manually created job control number
      will be provided by the 19 MOS/MTF to be entered into the 781 forms. Actual
      maintenance performed, i.e. repair, TCTO, or required inspection, will be entered into the
      G081 system.
 4                                                    LITTLEROCKAFBI21-138 9 JULY 2013


     4.2. A separate locally devised form, similar to the AFTO Form 781A, will be maintained to
     include permanently induced malfunctions and permanently induced/permanently delayed
     discrepancies. These items shall not affect safety, outward appearance, or tow capability.
     They may be entered into G081 and assigned a GO81 job control number.
        4.2.1. Only 19 MOS/MTF personnel will enter discrepancies in this section of the
        aircraft forms. When a discrepancy in the 781A is transferred to this section of the forms,
        the individual transferring a discrepancy will: sign their minimum signature in the
        corrected by block, mark the “Xfer 781K” box and annotate “Transferred to permanently
        induced/permanently delayed discrepancy list” or “TPDD”. If a discrepancy is corrected,
        the 19 MOS/MTF personnel will transfer the discrepancy to the AFTO Form 781A,
        where it will be cleared IAW AFI 00-20-1 AMC Sup 1.
        4.2.2. The permanently induced/permanently delayed discrepancies form will be placed
        in the AFTO Form 781 series binder behind the AFTO Form 781K, Aerospace Vehicle
        Inspection, Engine Data, Calendar Inspection and Delayed Discrepancy Document.
        4.2.3. The top margin of the permanently induced/permanently delayed discrepancies
        form will be annotated in RED with the following statement:          “Permanently
        induced/permanently delayed discrepancies.”
        4.2.4. Permanently induced malfunctions for student training are discrepancies induced
        on the equipment by 19 MOS/MTF or 373 TRS/Det 4 instructors as a learning situation
        for students to discover during maintenance/inspections.
        4.2.5. Permanently delayed discrepancies are those discrepancies deemed unnecessary or
        not viable for repair by MTF personnel that will not be corrected due to the age of the
        GITA, excessive costs/work hours, or lack of support capability to repair the discrepancy.
     4.3. Discrepancies that are continuously repeated (i.e. temporarily installed panels) will be
     entered in the AFTO form 781A by training personnel, but will not become permanent
     malfunctions. The words “Temp Installed” must be included in the discrepancy block.
5. Management of Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTO):
     5.1. The 19 MOS/MTF will ensure timely completion of applicable TCTOs on systems
     maintained in operational status and that proper configuration status accounting is
     maintained.
     5.2. The determination of TCTO applicability is the responsibility of 19 MOS/MTF
     personnel, with 19 MOS/CC as approval authority. 19 MXG/Quality Assurance (QA) will
     be consulted if necessary.
     5.3. The 19 MOS/MTF requisitions the TCTO kits and prepares all documentation. If
     TCTO kits are unavailable and it pertains to safety, then the affected system will be disabled.
     5.4. The 19 MOS PS&D and Engine Management section will notify 19 MOS/MTF
     personnel of all aircraft and engine TCTO meetings. 19 MOS/MTF personnel will attend
     meetings and ensure compliance of all applicable TCTOs.

      6.1.1. All units requiring aircraft for training purposes will submit their requests to the 19
      MOS/MTF before the 15th day of the second preceding month (i.e.- August requirements
      are due by 15 June). Late and short-notice requests will be allocated solely on the
      availability of aircraft.
      6.1.2. The 19 MOS/MTF will submit the aircraft schedule to PS&D on or before the 20th
      of the preceding month.
   6.2. The 19 MOS/MTF will ensure Little Rock AFB operational aircraft are used as training
   platforms only as a last resort.
7. Cannibalization Actions:
   7.1. Cannibalization actions are not authorized unless approved by the System Program
   Office. See AFI 21-101 AMC Supp 1, para 14.8.10.1 for further guidance.
8. GITA declared excess to training needs.
   8.1. The 19 MOS PS&D will notify HQ AMC and request disposition when GITA are
   declared excess to training needs.
   8.2. Once disposition is determined, i.e. reclamation via Defense Reutilization Management
   Office (DRMO) or reassigned under a static display program, the 19 MXG/CC will appoint a
   maintenance officer or SNCO as project official to oversee completion of all logistics support
   operations necessary to facilitate removal or transfer of the GITA. Requirements include the
   following measures.
      8.2.1. Request a non-programmed save list from the owning Air Logistics Center (ALC).
      8.2.2. Coordinate with the Aircraft Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMARC) and
      request demilitarization instructions and radiation handbook.
          8.2.2.1. When the save list is released from the ALC, it is not updated as changes in
          demand levels occur; i.e. no other inputs are made to it even though other items on
          the aircraft NOT on the list may have military value. To prevent the demilitarization
          of reclaimable i.e. valuable items, all demilitarization instructions must be screened.
          When items are determined to be reclaimable, contact the appropriate item manager
          for disposition instructions.
              8.2.2.1.1. The 19 MXS and 19 AMXS will provide maintenance support for
              GITA save list removals and demilitarization when outside of 19 MOS/MTF and
              373 TRS Det 4 capabilities.
              8.2.2.1.2. The 19 MOS/MTF will provide a copy of the reclaimable items listing
              to WRALC-LRBSI, and provide necessary coordination to ensure that item-
              removal actions will not impede processing of the excess GITA.
      8.2.3. The 19 MOS/MTF will process configured save list items through supply, and
      perform and document a limited demilitarization. The 19 MOS/MTF will coordinate
      with Bioenvironmental Engineering (19 MDG) to ensure that the GITA is hazard free as
      per radiation handbook and applicable messages. An AF Form 3580 will be
      accomplished to certify the GITA. If the GITA is being processed via AMARC, an
      AMARC Form 76 will also be accomplished.

    8.2.4. The 19 MOS/MTF will file a copy of the completed save list and demilitarization
    listing in the aircraft jacket file and provide it to the appropriate agency in accordance
    with disposition instructions, i.e. DRMO, AMARC or USAF Museum.
    8.2.5. The 19 MOS/MTF will forward a copy of the completed save list with supply
    turn-in documents to the appropriate ALC for processing.
    8.2.6. The 19 MOS/MTF will notify the 19 MXG/CC within 24 hours, or next duty day,
    when a GITA is accepted by DRMO or is shipped for static display purposes.
