SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This publication designates the Ramstein Air Base 24-hour arrival point and provides the Base INTRO
Manager procedural guidance for personnel data system support (Table 1 Line 5).
1. Table 1 Line 5. Billeting offices throughout the Kaiserslautern Military Community serve as the
Ramstein Air Base 24-hour arrival point. These facilities will function as the initial points of contact for
unexpected gains or newcomers who arrive after duty hours.
2. Table 1 Line 6. The Base INTRO Manager will ensure each arrival point has an up-to-date copy of the
INTRO Inbound Roster and the Unit Sponsor Monitor listing. These products offer a quick point of ref-
erence when no sponsor has been appointed and immediate assistance is needed.
