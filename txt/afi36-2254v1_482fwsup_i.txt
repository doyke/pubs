SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This change completely revises AFMAN 36-8001, Reserve Personnel Participation and
Training Procedures. It converts it back into an Instruction and breaks it out into Volumes.
Volume I covers Reserve Participation. Volume II covers Reserve Training. Volume III covers
Telecommuting/Advanced Distributed Learning. The numbering has changed to 36-22XX due
to the elimination of AFPD 36-80, Reserve Training and Education.

     Section Codes MA, MB, ME, or MR establishes a four-point requirement. Every month
     spent as an IMA in Reserve Sections MC, MD, or MH establishes a two-point monthly
     requirement. There remains an annual maximum of forty-eight points.
AFI36-2254V1_482FWSUP_I 23 JUNE 2011                                                           7


   1.2.3. All training must be scheduled and approved in advance. The supervisors of Reserve
   members (as determined by the commander) will track all training and participation needs.
   The supervisors may use any documentation method that best meets their needs and the
   needs of their members.
   1.2.4. Reservists assigned after 1 April (except those gained from another Selected Reserve
   Program) may prorate the number of IDTs for the remainder of that FY. All FY
   requirements must be met the following FY. Prorate the number of IDTs as follows: For
   IMAs assigned to reserve section MB, ME, and MR there is a four paid IDT requirement per
   month. For IMAs assigned to reserve section MC, there is a two paid IDT requirement per
   month. For IMAs assigned to reserve section MA there is a three paid and one nonpay IDT
   requirement per month.
1.3. Unsatisfactory Participation. Unsatisfactory participation is failure to meet requirements
of Table 1.1, and all general requirements. This is a basis for discharge or involuntary transfer
to the IRR (see AFI36-3209, Separation and Retirement Procedures for Air National Guard and
Air Force Reserve Members; AFI36-2115, Assignments Within the Reserve Components). See
also paragraph 4.14.
   1.3.1. A unit member who has nine or more unexcused IDT absences, in a 12-month period
   with the first month missed as month one, or has not completed a scheduled Annual Tour in
   an FY (unless substituted or excused) is considered an unsatisfactory participant.
   1.3.2. IMA unsatisfactory Participants.
       1.3.2.1. An IMA, who is required to perform 24 IDTs per FY, with four or more
       unexcused IDT absences, or who has not completed a scheduled Annual Tour in an FY
       (unless substituted or excused by the PM) is considered an unsatisfactory participant.
       1.3.2.2. An IMA, who is required to perform 48 IDTs per FY, with nine or more
       unexcused IDT absences, or who has not completed a scheduled Annual Tour in an FY
       (unless substituted or excused by the PM) is considered an unsatisfactory participant.
       1.3.2.3. The RMG distributes a list annually of unsatisfactory IMA FY participants to the
       PM. PMs must provide RMG written justification on each individual within 90 days in
       order to retain the member. PMs have the authority to approve a first and second time
       waiver. For centrally managed IMAs, the PM must obtain concurrence of the member’s
       functional manager. RMG/CC is the authority for all subsequent waivers. ARPC/DPAO
       provides a listing of participants who have not met FY requirements on Mobilization
       Assistants to the MA to AF/RE.
   1.3.3. Disposition of United States Air Force Reserve (AFRC) Unsatisfactory Participants.
   AFRC Commanders are authorized to take the following actions when necessary and
   appropriate:
       1.3.3.1. Delay or defer promotion.
       1.3.3.2. Administrative demotion.
       1.3.3.3. Involuntary 45 manday recall. Members who have not fulfilled their Military
       Service Obligation (MSO) in accordance with Title 10 U.S.C., Section 651, may be
       ordered to active duty for training (ADT), regardless of the length of prior AD or ADT,
       for a period of not more than 45 days under Title 10 U.S.C., Section 10148. Recall will

        be in a special Reserve Personnel Appropriation (RPA) tour status and must be
        performed at the unit of assignment/attachment. Enlisted members assigned to the
        Selected Reserve who are ordered to AD or ADT may be returned to their previous unit
        of assignment or transferred to the IRR. The member’s term of enlistment may be
        extended up to 6 months to permit completion of the designated period of AD in
        accordance with Title 10 U.S.C., Section 10148.
        1.3.3.4. Ordered to AD. Members in the Selected Reserve who have not fulfilled their
        MSO in accordance with Title 10 U.S.C., Section 651, and have not served on AD, or
        ADT for a total of 24 months, for such period of time the Secretary deems appropriate,
        may be required to serve on AD until their AD or ADT equals 24 months (Title 10
        U.S.C., Section 12303).
        1.3.3.5. Reassign unsatisfactory participants to the appropriate subcategory of IRR or
        Standby Reserve (with unit or PM authority respectively) in accordance with AFI 36-
        2115. Ensure that on transfer to the IRR, members understand their MSO as a member of
        the IRR, including the requirement for satisfactory participation in the annual reporting
        (Muster Duty and/or Push/Pull) program. Failure to satisfactorily participate in annual
        screening requirements may result in an involuntary recall to ADT for 45 days regardless
        of the length of prior AD or ADT.
        1.3.3.6. Initiate discharge action according to AFI 36-3209.
1.4. Excusing Members for Failure To Perform Minimum Prescribed Duties.
     1.4.1. Minimum Retention/Retirement (R/R) requirements. Unless permitted by other
     authority, a member qualified for retirement under the guidelines of AFI 36-3209, (except for
     having reached age 60) must accrue 50 total retirement points (including 15 membership
     points) during the full R/R year to stay in the Ready Reserve. Membership points are
     prorated for periods less than 1 year. If the points are not accrued, an officer or an enlisted
     member may be transferred to the IRR according to AFI 36-2115, or discharged according to
     AFI 36-3209. The member may be excused for failing to accrue the 50-point minimum due
     to personal hardship or other extraordinary circumstances. NOTE: Members do not receive
     credit for a satisfactory year of service for the year that is excused.
     1.4.2. Minimum FY requirements. Excusals for Annual Training (AT) must be obtained by
     1 June each FY. For IMA, excusal approval authority rests with the PM for the first two
     excusals, thereafter with the RMG commander. For centrally managed IMAs, the PM must
     obtain concurrence of the member’s functional manager. Unit commanders may excuse any
     part of AT or IDT. Excusals for IDT must be obtained before the scheduled training starts.
1.5. Excusable Authority for Failure To Perform Prescribed Training. Table 1.2 shows
approval authority to excuse members for failure to perform the minimum prescribed training
duties.
1.6. Medical Qualifications.
     1.6.1. All members must meet the medical standards in AFI 48-123, Volume I, and
     applicable Reserve medical guidance to be considered medically qualified to participate in
     any pay or point gaining activity.
AFI36-2254V1_482FWSUP_I 23 JUNE 2011                                                           9


   1.6.2. Members with expired medical or dental requirements (to include Reserve Component
   Periodic Health Assessment (RCPHA) are determined not in compliance with medical
   standards in AFI 48-123, Volume 1, or applicable Reserve medical guidance and, unless
   authorized by AFRC/SGP, may not participate in any pay or point gaining activities. Any
   IDT which is missed due to noncompliance will be considered excused; however, the
   commander may initiate involuntary transfer to the IRR in accordance with AFI 36-2115.
   1.6.3. A member identified as having a potentially disqualifying condition in accordance
   with AFI 48-123, Medical Exminations and Standards, attachment 2 notated on an AF Form
   469, Duty Limiting Condition Report, by any Air Reserve Component (ARC) or AD
   medical squadron will not be allowed to participate in any pay or point gaining activity until
   the disqualifying condition has been removed or an approved waiver is received from
   AFRC/SG in accordance with AFI 48-123. Any IDT which is missed due to this medical
   limitation will be considered excused. Member will be excused from any type of military
   duty requirements until the profile has been finalized by AFRC/SGP or removed. When
   applicable, the Personnel Data System (PDS) will be updated to reflect the member as
   excused.
   1.6.4. Pregnant reservists may volunteer to participate during UTAs and Reserve
   Management Periods (RMPs) during pregnancy when the following criteria are met:
      1.6.4.1. The decision is supported by the member, unit commander, military medical
      authorities, and obstetric care provider.
      1.6.4.2. The reservists home is located within 50 miles of the UTA location and the
      member commutes home during the UTA.
   1.6.5. Reservists may be placed on military orders for the purpose of receiving military
   medical/dental evaluation, or examination as identified in AFI 48-123, Volume I and AFI 41-
   115, Authorized Health Care and Health Care Benefits in the Military Health Services
   System (MHS), or treatment for in Line of Duty Conditions (LOD). This does not apply to
   the RCPHA. Reservists receiving medical/dental care during a tour of duty will be
   voluntarily retained on AD orders to continue treatment as identified in DoD Directive
   1241.1, Reserve Component Medical Care and Incapacitation Pay for Line of Duty
   Conditions.
      1.6.5.1. Reservists not on military orders may be placed on invitational travel orders
      when directed by appropriate military medical authority to receive an examinationor
      evaluation by military medical/dental facilities to meet military requirements.
      Invitational travel orders may also be issued to those reservists receiving military
      medical/dental care at military medical treatment facilities for the purpose of
      medical/dental appointments.
      1.6.5.2. Reserve or AD medical units do not extend, authorize the extension of, or issue
      military orders, or invitational travel orders. Order issuance or an extension is the
      responsibility of the commander.
1.7. Air Reserve Technician (ART) Status When Performing Military Duty. An ART must
be in an off duty or official leave status from their civil service position when they are
performing military duty. ("Official leave" includes annual leave, military leave, LWOP-US,
accrued compensatory time off, accrued travel compensatory time or accrued credit hours.)

1.8. Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Jurisdiction.
    1.8.1. The UCMJ applies to AFRC members during any IDT or AD. An AFRC member
    subject to Title 10 U.S.C, Section 802 may be placed or extended on AD without the consent
    of the member for UCMJ action for activities that occurred during an AD tour or during IDTs
    in accordance with AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice.
    1.8.2. General court-martial convening authority rests with designated AD and AFRC
    commanders. Reserve members are subject to UCMJ action by either of these authorities.
    1.8.3. When a reserve member is suspected of committing a UCMJ offense, update the
    member’s record to reflect ―under investigation or pending separation‖ in the PDS. The
    Reserve unit commander must notify HQ AFRC/A1 to take this action. The RMG/PM will
    ensure RMG/DP is notified to do the updates for individual reservists.
    1.8.4. When a reservist is on AD, the active duty commander or reserve commander
    exercising UCMJ authority must inform the member’s assigned/attached organization upon
    initiating an investigation.
    1.8.5. A Reservist pending investigation or court-martial may remain on existing orders
    through completion of the investigation and/or court-martial up until expiration of the order.
    The Reservist may be released at that time pending recall at a later time. If it is determined
    that the member should be retained on AD involuntarily under Title 10 U.S.C., Section 802,
    orders will be updated with the appropriate MPA fund cite. Orders must reflect ―disiplinary
    action against member.‖
    1.8.6. Reserve members who are being court–martialed after coming off of orders or from
    IDT service, must be recalled involuntarily under Title 10 U.S.C., Section 802 citing MPA
    funds. Involutary recall authority for this type of action rests with the Secretary of the Air
    Force and will be processed pursuant to AFI 51-201.
1.9. Leave Entitlement. Accrued leave must be included in tour orders of 30 days or more.
Barring unforeseen circumstances, the member must be afforded the opportunity to take unused
leave. Reference AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program.

NUMBERS IN PARENTHESIS REFERENCE NOTES
NOTES:
1. Do not credit AD as IDT. The commander of a Reserve medical unit or HQ AFRC/SG may permit an
assigned health service officer to attend one continuing health education (CHE) activity each year in place of a
portion of the AT requirement with concurrence of the unit of assignment. Do not authorize if the action would
have a negative impact to the member's primary mission.
2. Prorate the maximum allowable paid points in an FY for members who move between categories (to include
accessions from AD). Calculate as follows: Every month as a unit reservist or IMA in Reserve Sections MA,
MB, ME, or MR establishes a four point requirement. Every month spent as an IMA in Reserve Sections MC,
or MD, establishes a two point monthly requirement. There remains an annual maximum of 48 points.
3. Each Reserve unit must schedule at least one UTA each month (a UTA consists of two 4-hour periods per
day for 2 days). When the unit's AT precludes scheduling a UTA within the same month, the commander may
schedule the UTA the month prior to or after the AT even though two UTAs are performed in the same month.
Wing commanders may approve split UTAs when a unit deploys to an alternate training location or approve
deviations from the monthly UTA requirement to conduct staff assistance visits (SAVs), prepare for, or
participate in, an operational readiness inspection, or cancel a UTA because of severe weather conditions.
4. An additional flying training period (AFTP) does not count toward the maximum paid TPs for the FY.
5. Unit reservists must perform at least 14 ATs. However, the maximum they can earn in a FY is 15 days.
Numbered Air Force (NAF)/CC may authorize AT up to 20 days, if funding is available (excluding authorized
travel time) to support training requirements. If the deployment is less than 20 days, AT approval is for that
specific deployment time. However, due to departing/returning transportation delays, the Deployment Review
Board (DRB) approval letter serves as the approval waiver request for the additional unscheduled AT days, not
to exceed 20 days. For example, if a deployment is approved for 16 days of AT and due to transportation
delays the deployment lasted 19 days, the additional 3 days do not require a separate AT waiver. The approved
DRB letter will serve as the approval waiver request. Any deployment exceeding 20 days will require an
approved AT waiver from HQ AFRC/CV. The MPF will update PDS accordingly.
6. If funding is available, an IMA in Reserve Section MA, MB, ME, or MR, may perform up to 15 days AT in
an FY with approval of the PM. IMAs in Reserve section MC, or MD, normally perform 12 days AT in an FY,
unless a waiver is obtained in advance from the PM. If training opportunities are available, a member may
perform up to a 14-day tour if funding is available. Provide justification in the "Remarks" section of the order
request.
7. This block includes weapons controllers, ground radar operators, base disaster preparedness/air base
operability officers, members assigned to rated positions not requiring active flying, and Federal and state
preparedness liaison officers, Critical Medical specialties in 9026 ARS. For purposes of this AFI only, the term
―aircrew‖ will encompass all officer and enlisted flyers operating manned or unmanned aerial vehicles,
Guardian Angel, Aeromedical and space personnel.
8. Members of the 9019 ARS and 9026 ARS accomplish their training at the unit of attachment.

         ALLOWABLE FEDERAL SERVICE FOR MEMBERS OF THE AFRC

2.1. Definition of Points. Points are a unit of measurement for tracking a member’s
participation. They are also used to calculate the amount of participation for retirement
purposes. The number of earned points determine a member's eligibility for retention both in
Ready Reserve programs and in an active Reserve status. Active Reserve status means any
status other than an assignment to the ISLRS, the Temporary Disability Retired List, the Inactive
National Guard, or the Retired Reserve Section. See AFI 36-3209 for the minimum amount of
service required for a Reserve retirement.
2.2. Crediting Points and Satisfactory Federal Service. Award one point for each day of AD.
Award one point for 4 hours of IDT, not to exceed two points per calendar day. AFIADL
determines the number of study hours awarded for AFIADL courses, and normally awards one
point for each 3 study hours. Membership points are credited, up to 15 points (prorate points for
periods less than a year) for active Reserve status for each R/R year. Points may only be credited
to the date a member actually performed the duty, except in those activities where the cumulative
method is authorized, such as telecommuting.
2.3. Maximum Points Creditable. No more than 365 points (366 for a leap year) are creditable
in one R/R year. Credit a combined total of no more than 130 retirement points for IDT,
Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) courses, and membership points for members whose R/R
year ends on or after 30 October 2007. For members whose R/R year ends between 23
September 1996 and 29 October 2000, no more than 75 IDT retirement points may be credited.
For members whose R/R year ends prior to 23 September 1996, no more than 60 IDT retirement
points may be credited. Satisfactory Federal service cannot exceed the actual number of
calendar days. Award a year of satisfactory Federal service for retirement when a member earns
a minimum of 50 points (including membership points) in their full R/R year. Award a partial
year of satisfactory Federal service for retirement when the member earns the minimum number
of required points (including prorated membership points) during a partial R/R year (see AFI 36-
3203, Service Retirements.
2.4. AD Points. Points may be earned for serving on AD during peacetime or mobilization.
These points are credited under other armed forces or uniformed services directives and are
creditable toward Reserve satisfactory service for retirement.
2.5. Training, Pay, and Point Activities. Table 2.1, Table 2.2, and Table 2.3 specify the
training and retired categories entitled to earn points.
   2.5.1. IDT points may be earned as shown in Table 2.1, Table 2.2, and Table 2.3.
       2.5.1.1. RMPs are additional IDT periods which are used to improve unit readiness by
       providing the required and necessary training to attain and maintain designated readiness
       levels. Additional guidance provided in paragraph 4.1.4.3.
       2.5.1.2. Equivalent Reserve Instruction (ERI). An AFRC member may receive ERI non-
       pay points for attending a professional or trade convention that will increase the
       member's professional development or mobilization readiness. The member must have
AFI36-2254V1_482FWSUP_I 23 JUNE 2011                                                        19


     prior approval of the unit commander for unit reservists or PM for IMAs/Participating
     Individual Ready Reserve (PIRR) to perform ERI.
         2.5.1.2.1. Send ERI point eligibility requests, in advance, through the member's unit
         of assignment/RMG PM for approval. Award points when:
         2.5.1.2.2. The member signs in with a designated military monitor or conference
         official.
         2.5.1.2.3. The meeting must be at least 4 hours in duration before a member receives
         point credit. Award a maximum of one point per day for these activities. For medical
         personnel to earn points only for continuing medical education, the meeting must be
         for at least 6 hours.
  2.5.2. ATPs. ATPs is another category of additional IDT that is intended for use by units,
  components of units, and individuals, and are also intended for accomplishing additional
  required training, as defined by post-mobilization mission requirements. Commanders must
  consider statutory funding requirements prior to approving ATPs. ATPs cannot exceed more
  than 36 periods per each member per FY. A combination of ATPs and RMPs cannot exceed
  54 periods per FY.
  2.5.3. AFTPs are authorized for primary aircrew members for conducting aircrew training
  and combat crew qualification training to attain and maintain aircrew flying proficiency and
  sustain required readiness. These AFTPs cannot be in addition to the ATPs in
  subparagraph 2.5.2. Except for aircrew members, the combination of ATPs and RMPs shall
  not exceed 54 in each FY for each person. Combinations of ATPs, AFTPs, and RMPs for
  aircrew members shall not exceed 72 in an FY, with the Secretary concerned authorized to
  provide a waiver to a maximum of 96 additional IDT periods for an aircrew member in an
  FY.
  2.5.4. Special Projects and Training. Commanders, PMs, and supervisors of MAJCOM
  assigned IMAs/PIRRs may authorize other point gaining activities. Members must get
  written authorization in advance for such activities. For centrally managed IMAs/PIRRs, the
  PM must obtain concurrence of the member’s functional manager. The following are
  examples that may earn additional IDT point credit:
     2.5.4.1. Liaison and Counseling. This entails face-to-face contact with the person for
     whom a specific program is planned. EXAMPLES: a meeting with an applicant for the
     Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps; the ALO Program; or the Air Force Health
     Professions Scholarship Program.
     2.5.4.2. Public Information. Activities in this category bring favorable publicity to the
     Air Force or the AFRC. Examples include a presentation about the Air Force to a civic
     group or taking part in an Armed Forces Day activity.
     2.5.4.3. Administration and Management. A member may earn points by preparing
     approved correspondence (studies, charts, analyses, etc.) that supports the mission of the
     individual program; writing or processing officer or enlisted member performance
     reports; coordinating or supervising personnel who support MAJCOM, HQ ARPC; or
     individual PM directed activities.

                                          Chapter 3

                    INITIAL ACTIVE DUTY FOR TRAINING (IADT)

3.1. IADT.
   3.1.1. A non-prior service (NPS) enlistee must perform IADT for a period of at least 84
   days. Before being released from IADT, each enlistee must attend basic military training
   (BMT) and attend technical training (TT) to obtain the 3-skill level of the assigned Air Force
   Specialty. This may take place over consecutive days, or due to lack of available TT,
   member may be returned home and removed from IADT after completion of BMT, and
   return to IADT status later when TT is available (Split Training Option (STO)). Waivers
   may be granted from the Air Force Reserve functional managers for award of 3-skill level, if
   warranted, and will be initiated by HQ AFRC/RS. NOTE: For the purpose of this
   instruction, NPS is defined as any member/applicant who had not previously completed
   IADT in it’s entirety (BMT follow on TT).
   3.1.2. MPF Relocations will publish IADT orders at the time of enlistment, but not later than
   60 days before the reporting date. They must cite Title 10 U.S.C., Section 12103 as the
   authority. Non-prior service members must start, in so far as practical, the IADT within 270
   days. For all practical purpose, all NPS members are to begin IADT within 270 days after
   enlistment, and only those with extenuating circumstances should be allowed longer time to
   begin IADT. Under no circumstances are members to go beyond 365 days after enlistment
   before beginning IADT, otherwise, they are to be discharged. (NOTE: The 60 days are for
   publication of the IADT order; not for accessing the member’s record. Member’s record
   must be established within 5-working days after enlistment.)
   3.1.3. To establish a pay date an NPS member must participate prior to IADT. NPS
   members are restricted to no more than 2 IDT periods prior to IADT in order to establish pay
   date.
   3.1.4. Enlistment Options:
       3.1.4.1. STO is available to meet command end strength goals when sufficient amount of
       BMT quotas are avialable but without immediate follow-on TT class dates. Detailed
       instructions on how to administer STO are located in Attachments 3 through 6.
       3.1.4.2. Enlistments without BMT option is authorized only when there are insufficent
       BMT dates/exhausted follow-on technical school dates within the Command and will be
       administered with AFRC/A1/RS coordination and AFRC/CV approval.
3.2. Responsibilities for IADT.
   3.2.1. The Formal Schools Branch, HQ AFRC/A1, in concert with HQ AFRC/RS and HQ
   AFRC Functional Managers, determines the program requirements and student flow for
   BMT and for TT. Training requirements will be identified through established Formal
   School Forecast Tool available on HQ AFRC/A1 web site. Only HQ AFRC, not subordinate
   units, may communicate directly with course owners (i.e., Air Education and Training
   Command (AETC), Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Mobility Command, etc.). Annually
   HQ AFRC verifies and projects their trained personnel requirements by Air Force Specialty
30                                                 AFI36-2254V1_482FWSUP_I 23 JUNE 2011


  Code (AFSC), for the current and following 3 years; identifies and processes requirements by
  AFSC according to guidance received from HQ AETC/DO and/or AF/A1.
  3.2.2. Responsibilities of the Enlisting Unit:
     3.2.2.1. If the attachment and training outlined above are not possible, do not enlist the
     applicant. Send the recruiting quotas back to HQ AFRC with a letter of explanation.
     3.2.2.2. Ensures that the member meets Air Force fitness standards (AFI 10-248)
     immediately before departure for IADT.
     3.2.2.3. Immediately upon enlistment, begins processing the member for the appropriate
     security clearance required for the technical school or unit assignment.
  3.2.3. Substandard Performance While on IADT/BMT/TT.
     3.2.3.1. If an AFRC member commits an offense that demonstrates substandard
     performance the attached commander may initiate UCMJ or administrative discharge
     action under AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen. If UCMJ or discharge
     action is initiated, the unit of attachment will notify the unit of assignment and conclude
     UCMJ or discharge processing. If the AFRC member is to be returned to the unit of
     assignment for processing and action, the unit of attachment publishes orders relieving
     the member from attachment and directs him or her to the assigned servicing MPF, at
     which time the member reverts to inactive status.
     3.2.3.2. Examples of substandard performance are:
         3.2.3.2.1. Failure to comply with IADT orders.
         3.2.3.2.2. Absence without leave.
         3.2.3.2.3. Failure to complete a training course due to lack of effort or failure to
         achieve a 3-skill level AFSC. (EXCEPTION: Failure to achieve a 3-skill level due
         to incomplete processing of a security clearance required for award of an AFSC.)
         3.2.3.2.4. Commission of an offense under the UCMJ leading to administrative
         actions including discharge action (per AFI 36-3208) or a court-martial conviction.
         Air Force Reserve TT liaisons must notify parent unit commanders immediately upon
         learning of a member’s commission of an offense.
         3.2.3.2.5. Lost time, unless it is made up with the approval of HQ AFRC/A1.
     3.2.3.3. Upon a member's elimination from TT school, the commander's options are:
         3.2.3.3.1. Reclassify. Force Utilization (AFRC/A1), is the office of primary
         responsibility (OPR) for reclassifying members into another AFSC according to AFI
         36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officers and Enlisted). The commander can
         request a school quota for the new AFSC, if AETC concurs. When possible,
         accomplish reclassification actions before the member leaves the TT center. The HQ
         AFRC Liaison non-commissioned officer (NCO) at the TT center will assist in this
         situation.
         3.2.3.3.2. Administrative Discharge. Commanders should contact the Personnel
         Relocation Element, DPMSA, when discharging members according to AFI 36-3209.
AFI36-2254V1_482FWSUP_I 23 JUNE 2011                                                            31


3.3. Personal Hardship While on IADT. The unit of attachment commander may initiate
action to relieve Reserve members from IADT and discharge them for personal hardship. The
commander may also relieve the member from TT without relieving them from IADT, and return
them to their designated unit. Upon resolution of the personal hardship, the respective wing
training office will coordinate with HQ AFRC/A1 to facilitate the return of the member to the
appropriate TT. If return to the appropriate TT is not possible, the member will be reclassified or
discharged.
3.4. Retention on IADT. The unit of attachment commander may involuntarily retain the
member on IADT beyond the planned time span without the member's consent.
   3.4.1. Retain an individual on IADT when: scheduled for a later TT start date, through no
   fault of their own; HQ AETC is unable to provide training on some 3-level tasks (Authority:
   Title 50 U.S.C., App 454 (a)), or for other reasons required by law.
   3.4.2. Release members processed for court martial under AFI 51-201, or discharge under
   AFI 36-3209, from TT, but retain on IADT orders and return them to their designated unit for
   discharge processing.
   3.4.3. When retaining members beyond the date specified for the end of their tour, the MPF
   at the unit of assignment will amend the IADT orders to extend the tour. IADT orders will
   not be extended once the member has been awarded their 3-skill level.
   3.4.4. Retain members on IADT orders who are undergoing disability evaluation, are
   receiving ongoing medical treatment or identified as having a disqualifying condition in
   accordance with AFI 48-123, Volume 2, attachment 2 notated on an AF IMT 422a or AF
   IMT 469 . Retain members on orders until final disposition of their medical condition,
   disability evaluation, or removal of the disqualifying condition by appropriate medical
   authority.
3.5. Hospitalization and Disability. Members receive the same medical care as regular Air
Force members receive during an IADT tour. A member's dependents may receive medical care
if the IADT order specifies that the AD tour is for 30 days or more (authority AFI 41-115), and
other applicable directives). A member receives pay and allowances while undergoing medical
treatment or hospitalization, including processing under AFI 36-3212, Physical Evaluation for
Retention, Retirement, and Separation. AFI 36-3212 contains requirements for evaluating a
member on IADT who may have a physical defect that interferes with their availability for
worldwide service (refer to AFI 36-2910, Line of Duty (Misconduct) Determination, for LOD
determinations).
3.6. Issuing Uniforms. AFI 36-3014, Clothing Allowance for Air Force Personnel, covers
uniform item issue. RPA funds cover the clothing costs.
3.7. Master Personnel Record (MPerR).
   3.7.1. HQ ARPC maintains the MPerR for AFRC members.
   3.7.2. The unit of assignment maintains the field personnel record (FPerR). When the
   member attends IADT, the unit of assignment sends the FPerR and 25 copies of the IADT
   orders to the MPF at the unit of attachment. AFI 36-2608 covers distribution of records.
3.8. Procedures for Catastrophic or other Extreme Events. Refer to Volume 2, Chapter 1,
of this AFI, Reserve Personnel Training.

3.9. Release From IADT.
   3.9.1. Release members after completing their tour, award of the 3-skill level. Do not
   release members from IADT unless they meet the medical standards for retention in
   accordance with AFI 48-123, Volume I, have a DD Form 2697, Report of Medical
   Assessment completed as required by AFI 48-123, Volume I, and have no ongoing medical
   conditions which would interfere with performance of their Reserve military duty. Members
   completing BMT and TT with:
      3.9.1.1. Seven or more days left to complete the minimum 84 days IADT time specified,
      are returned to their unit of assignment unless otherwise specified in the tour order, for
      on-the-job training (OJT). Release members upon tour completion.
      3.9.1.2. Less than 7 days remaining on the tour, are held at the unit of attachment and
      released after completion of the tour.
   3.9.2. The MPF at the unit of attachment must publish orders as prescribed by AFI 65-109,
   Preparation of AF Form 938, for members released from their tour for reasons other than the
   normal end of tour. Send five copies to the servicing MPF at the unit of assignment.
   3.9.3. The MPF servicing the unit that ends the tour must either complete or arrange for the
   entire separation processing of the member. Before release of the member from IADT,
   ensure a thorough review of the member's health records.
   3.9.4. Issue the DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge From Active Duty,
   according to instructions in this chapter and AFI 36-3209. The servicing HQ AFRC MPF for
   the unit of assignment issues the form. The completion date for the IADT tour is when the
   member returns to the place of entry. (NOTE: For members performing IADT via Split
   Training Option, DD Form 214 will be completed upon award of 3-level or release from
   training after 90 days or more. DD Form 214 should reflect time spent in BMT within the
   Remarks section of the form.) Include authorized travel days on the DD Form 214. The 37th
   Mission Support Squadron accomplishes the form for members who fail to complete BMT.

                            INACTIVE DUTY TRAINING (IDT)

4.1. Crediting IDT. A member may not perform inactive duty and AD on the same day.
Reference the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR) for IDT travel entitlements outside
normal commuting distance. The types of IDT are:
   4.1.1. TP. A 4-hour period of training, duty, or instruction. A TP is typically 4 hours in
   duration (no less than 2 hours if training must be interrupted for unusual circumstances (e.g.,
   inclement weather), but can be longer at Commander’s/RMG PM’s discretion. This
   exception must only be used for unusual circumstances (not for individual needs) and is not
   to be used indiscriminately. Under no circumstances will the waiver be authorized when
   accumulation of time is used.
   4.1.2. UTA. A planned period of training, duty, instruction, or test alert completed by a
   Reserve unit.
   4.1.3. Equivalent Training (ET). A TP accomplished in place of a scheduled UTA or TP.
   4.1.4. Additional IDT (as specified by DoDI 1215.06) periods are authorized training in
   excess of statutorily prescribed training.
      4.1.4.1. ATPs. ATP is another category of additional IDT that is intended for use by
      units, components of units, and individuals, and are also intended for accomplishing
      additional required training, as defined by post-mobilization mission requirements.
      AFRC restricts use of ATPs to rated officers, career enlisted aviators and non-rated
      aircrews. Commanders must consider statutory funding requirements prior to approving
      ATPs. ATPs cannot exceed more than 30 periods per each member per FY. A
      combination of ATPs and RMPs cannot exceed 54 periods per FY. NOTE: Inactive
      flight surgeons may be authorized to fly and log time without ACIP on a noninterference
      basis with unit training and flying schedules in accordance with AFI 11-401.
      4.1.4.2. AFTP. A flying TP authorized for an individual assigned to an authorized active
      flying position. No more than 48 AFTPs per member are allowed per FY, and cannot be
      used in addition to ATPs.
          4.1.4.2.1. AGTP. A Ground TP which is a participation category unique to Air Force
          Reserve, and is a sub-set of AFTPs. AGTPs are restricted to use by individuals
          assigned to an authorized flying position, and is used in performance of or to support
          required ground and flying training, simulator training, and other readiness training
          required by MAJCOM. AGTPs count against the 48 AFTPs per FY limitation.
      4.1.4.3. RMPs. RMPs are primarily used by unit personnel and are to be used to support
      ongoing day-to-day operations of the unit, accomplishing unit administration, support
      activities, and maintenance functions all with the sole purpose of preparing the unit for
      training. RMPs are not to be used to satisfy individual training requirements.
          4.1.4.3.1. Members are authorized to perform no more than 24 paid RMPs per FY.
          Except for aircrew members, the combination of ATPs and RMPs shall not exceed 54
          in each FY for each person. Combinations of ATPs, AFTPs, and RMPs for aircrew
 34                                            AFI36-2254V1_482FWSUP_I 23 JUNE 2011


          members shall not exceed 72 in an FY, with the Secretary concerned authorized to
          provide a waiver to a maximum of 96 additional IDT periods for an aircrew member
          in a FY.
          4.1.4.3.2. RMPs will not be performed in conjunction with another TP (i.e., IDT,
          ATPs, AGTP, or AFTP).
          4.1.4.3.3. Members are authorized only one RMP per calendar day (a minimum 4
          hours duration for one point).
          4.1.4.3.4. RMPs may not be used as a substitute for completion of FY statutory IDT
          requirements. Missed RMPs will not be coded as excused or unexcused.
          4.1.4.3.5. Travel days are not authorized for RMPs
4.2. IDT Authorization.
   4.2.1. All IDT must:
      4.2.1.1. Have advance written authorization from the member's commander (or
      designated representative). A signature is required in Block III of the AF Form 40A
      (http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AF40a.xfdl). For AFTP/AGTP,
      written authorization includes the flight authorization and approved AGTP forms.
      4.2.1.2. Ensure appropriate and adequate training is provided. IMAs in Reserve Sections
      MA, MB, ME, and MR are authorized 48 IDT periods per FY. IMAs in Reserve Section
      MC are authorized 24 IDT periods per FY. PIRR members in Reserve Sections MD,
      MT, MX are authorized to perform unpaid IDT periods to obtain minimum R/R year
      requirements. IMA members will develop a schedule of IDTs with their supervisors no
      later than (NLT) 15 August for the upcoming FY. All IDT periods for both IMA and
      PIRR members must be approved in advance, in writing, by the member's supervisor with
      an information copy to the appropriate assigned PM, prior to the member performing any
      IDT period.
      4.2.1.3. Be performed for pay and points, or points only as an USAFR member without
      pay from another United States (US) government source (i.e., no dual compensation).
   4.2.2. IDT performed for pay must prepare a USAFR member for mobilization. Authorized
   IDT activities are shown in Table 2.1, Table 2.2, and Table 2.3. The certifying official
   documents all IDT on a mechanized AF IMT 40, Authorization for Inactive Duty Training
   (http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/formfiles/af/af40/af40.xfd), for unit members or an AF
   Form 40A (http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/formfiles/af/af40a/af40a.xfd) for individual
   reservists.
   4.2.3. Reference the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR) for IDT travel entitlements
   outside normal commuting distance. Generally, travel pay is not authorized for travel to or
   from the place of IDT. Unit members, except for aircrew performing flight duty, are not
   authorized to perform travel while in IDT status, and/or for the sole purpose of pre-
   positioning a member, for an ADT or AT tour unless approved by the NAF commander or
   HQ AFRC/CVA (for example conducting SAVs).
   4.2.4. See AFI 36-2504, Officer Promotion, Continuation and Selective Early Removal in
   the Reserve of the Air Force, for additional IDT requirements for general officers.
AFI36-2254V1_482FWSUP_I 23 JUNE 2011                                                           35


   4.2.5. Only members in authorized positions may take part in aircrew flying training
   activities.
   4.2.6. IDT can be performed in conjunction with AT, ADT, or ADOS. Under no
   circumstances should ADT or ADOS be combined with IDT for the purpose of providing
   travel expenses to the IDT location. Commanders and supervisors should ensure that all
   ADT or ADOS tours performed in conjunction with IDT can be substantiated by a valid
   support or training requirement.
   4.2.7. Overseas IDT. Members assigned/attached Continental United States (CONUS) are
   not allowed to perform IDT overseas. For the purpose of this section, ―overseas‖ is defined
   as ―outside the US and its territories and possessions and Guantanamo Bay Naval Station,
   Cuba.‖
       4.2.7.1. Members who reside within the US and its territories and possessions may not
       perform IDT overseas unless assigned/attached overseas.
       4.2.7.2. A member who resides overseas may perform IDT in the country in which they
       are assigned/attached.
       4.2.7.3. Members must be covered during the entire period at the foreign overseas
       location       by         the          AF        Form        40A   (http://www.e-
       publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AF40a.xfdl). Under no circumstances are IDTs
       to be performed in areas of hostile fire or imminent danger.
       4.2.7.4. If departing CONUS in IDT status, member must convert to civilian status
       (ARTs only, see para 4.11.1.16) or AD status prior to landing overseas. In-flight duty
       status conversions to AD status are permitted in accordance with scheduling documents
       such as an AF Form 938, Request and Authorization Forc Active Duty
       Training/Active Tour. No more than one duty status conversion may be made in one
       crew duty day for aircrew personnel or 1-calendar day for non-aircrew personnel.
       Complete AFTO Forms 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document
       (http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFTO781.xfdl), in accordance
       with applicable Air Force and local directives. Include separate lines to record the flying
       time accomplished in each duty status.
4.3. Constructively Present. The term constructively present applies to unit reservists who are
on tours of AD which overlap scheduled UTA.
   4.3.1. If, as a condition of approving a member for a special tour of AD, the respective
   commander requires the member to attend regularly scheduled UTA, then the agency using
   the member on AD must first agree to address the AD order allowing variations (to include a
   specific itinerary) in travel reimbursement to permit travel. The member will not be
   compensated or credited for UTA since they are already in military status. If such an
   agreement is not reached, the member is not to be placed on AD orders.
   4.3.2. If the commander does not require the member to attend scheduled UTA while
   performing a tour of AD, the commander will consider the member constructively present
   (which effectively excuses the member from scheduled UTA).
4.4. Authorizing Official. The authorizing official for IDT is the commander or a
representative designated in writing.
 36                                               AFI36-2254V1_482FWSUP_I 23 JUNE 2011


4.5. Scheduling UTAs.
   4.5.1. Unit commanders prepare an FY schedule for monthly UTAs NLT 15 March for the
   upcoming FY. Commanders may authorize up to a maximum of 16 TPs per quarter, not to
   exceed 48 periods per FY. Exception to this policy will be forwarded to NAF/CC for
   approval. The commander may extend a UTA beyond the normally scheduled time to meet
   mission needs.
   4.5.2. Training Flights or Teams. Publish training orders or a rescheduling letter before the
   date of the UTA. The orders or letter must list every member on the flight or team, specify
   who will supervise the training, and specify who will certify the attendance. The unit
   commander may grant the authority to set up these flights or teams.
4.6. UTA Schedule Reports. The Wing Commander submits a consolidated schedule for all
assigned units through the MPF/CC, for NAF/CC approval not later than 15 May for the
upcoming FY.
   4.6.1. A wing or separate unit organized and trained to serve as a unit when mobilized may
   be divided into flights or teams. The flight team commander may schedule a UTA to permit
   better use of equipment or facilities, or to train with a flying squadron.
   4.6.2. The Wing Commander submits notification of changes to the master schedule to the
   MPF/CC, for NAF/CC approval at least 90 days before the proposed date. Forward an info
   copy of all changes involving HQ AFRC airlift to the functional OPR.
4.7. Rescheduling UTAs. Unit commanders may reschedule UTAs for an entire unit, an
individual or groups of individuals. Commanders must use discretion and sound judgment in
employing this option. Do not use rescheduled training as a substitute for equivalent training
(reference para 4.10). Training performed during the rescheduled UTA must benefit individual
training, unit training, and unit readiness to the same extent as the originally scheduled UTA. At
a minimum, commanders must clearly document that the rescheduled training is as effective for
the member and unit readiness as the scheduled training. Training flight orders or the remarks
section      of       AF      IMT       40       or    AF       Form        40A      (http://www.e-
publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AF40a.xfdl) or Unit Training Assembly Processing
System (UTAPS) AF Form 40A as appropriate will contain the statement, "Rescheduled UTA
will provide the same type and quality of training as the originally scheduled UTA." Each
commander will keep all related participation documents to support excused and unexcused
absences and rescheduled UTAs or IDTs.
   4.7.1. Rescheduled UTAs must be approved in advance and documented on a training flight
   order or AF Form 40A (http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AF40a.xfdl).
   Rescheduling must be in the best interest of the Air Force Reserve mission accomplishment.
   Its primary purpose is not for personal convenience. A decision to reschedule may be based
   on the unit mission needs, training opportunities, and member’s availability. Rescheduled
   training may be performed at any time during the same FY. DO NOT HONOR AFTER THE
   FACT RESCHEDULING REQUESTS. Commanders may excuse missed TPs or approve
   ET. Commanders may grant an excused absence of a member based on the member's
   submission of adequate justification within 30 days prior to or 30 days following the missed
   UTA. Do not authorize excusals outside the 30-day period. At the fourth unexcused
   absence, an automated participation status report is generated. The unit commander has 30
AFI36-2254V1_482FWSUP_I 23 JUNE 2011                                                              37


   days from the date of the ninth unexcused absence to excuse those absences from the
   previous UTA, authorize ET, retain as a mobilization resource, initiate involuntary
   reassignment in accordcance with AFI 36-2115, or administrative discharge in accordance
   with AFI 36-3209. It is possible to retain individuals as a mobilization resource only under
   the conditions authorized by AFI 36-2115).
   4.7.2. Do not reschedule UTAs after a member’s loss date. (A Reserve member is not
   authorized participation privileges after their effective loss date.) Example 1: UTA is 26-27
   October, retirement, HQ ARPC reassignment, or Expiration Term of Service (ETS) discharge
   effective date is 26 October, member wants to reschedule to perform on 24-25 October; NOT
   AUTHORIZED. Example 2: Retirement, HQ ARPC reassignment, or ETS discharge
   effective date is 21 June, member wants to reschedule Jul, Aug, Sep, UTAs to perform prior
   to 21 June retirement effective date; NOT AUTHORIZED.
   4.7.3. Do not reschedule UTAs before a member is assigned to the unit program. (A Reserve
   member is not authorized participation privileges before their effective assignment date).
   EXAMPLE: A member assigned in December will not be allowed to reschedule October
   and November UTAs, which were prior to effective gain date to the unit.
4.8. Training Attachments. To best meet training goals, a member (other than one assigned to
a general officer position) may be attached for duty to other than the unit of assignment,
provided the member can be trained in duty AFSC. For centrally managed IRs, the PM
implements the decision of the functional managers.
   4.8.1. In most cases, IDT takes place at the unit of assignment or attachment. To enhance
   unit readiness or support a mission need, a unit (or part of a unit or individuals) may be sent
   to an alternate training site, if adequate facilities or equipment are not available at either the
   unit of assignment or unit of attachment. Assign most IMAs to a single training location
   (STL) where all training (IDT and AT) is conducted. Regardless of training location, the
   member may be mobilized to the position to which they are assigned. The STL may be
   within the same command that has the manpower need or within another command. The
   RMG Detachment PM makes the final decision as to the location of the STL. In those cases
   where the STL policy is not feasible, IMAs may, at the discretion of the RMG Detachment
   PM, perform IDT at an attached location, and perform AT and mobilization requirements at
   the assigned location.
   4.8.2. The unit of assignment gives the unit of attachment sufficient information about the
   member's mobilization duties so that training may be structured to allow for the performance
   of those types of tasks. The commander of the unit in which training is desired approves the
   request for such training in writing. This letter should describe available training and state
   whether there is any objection to the member’s training with the unit. The letter is then sent
   to the member’s immediate commander who approves the request. If a member is attached
   to another unit for training, the unit of assignment authorizes the unit of attachment to
   prepare            an            AF           Form             40A             (http://www.e-
   publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AF40a.xfdl).         In this case, the ―Authorizing
   Activity‖ shown on the form is the unit of attachment, and the ―Organization‖ is the unit of
   assignment. Write ―Training Attachment‖ in parenthesis in Item 10, Training Unit of
   Activity. Three signatures are required on the AF Form 40A; the member taking part in the
   training, the official authorizing the training, and the certifying official (commander or
 38                                             AFI36-2254V1_482FWSUP_I 23 JUNE 2011


   person, military or civilian) who supervised the training for the dates and periods
   accomplished). Send a copy of the AF Form 40A to the unit of assignment after the training
   is performed for appropriate action.
   4.8.3. Approval Authority for Training Attachments.
       4.8.3.1. The unit commander must approve training attachment before the training
       begins. The unit of assignment must publish an assignment/attachment order to include
       reporting official, unit of attachment and unit of assignment, and duration of attachment.
       Attachment must not normally exceed 6 months.
       4.8.3.2. For IRs, the RMG Detachment PM and the unit of attachment commander must
       approve training attachment before the training begins. For centrally managed IRs, the
       PM must obtain concurrence of the member’s functional manager.
   4.8.4. If an Air Force Reserve member is attached to a nonAir Force agency, the member's
   unit of assignment must provide the attached unit with instructions for preparing AF Form
   40A (http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AF40a.xfdl).
   4.8.5. Reserve component members of other US armed services may be attached for training
   with an AC unit, under the following conditions:
       4.8.5.1. Proper training is not reasonably available in their own component, but is
       available in an AC unit.
       4.8.5.2. The commander of the unit in which training is desired approves a request for
       the training in writing. The commander must include a statement relative to the type of
       available training for requests that are approved. Process approved applications
       according to the requirements of the individual's service.
   4.8.6. With the concurrence of both commanders, a member of a Reserve unit may be
   attached to another HQ AFRC unit, ANG unit, or to an AC unit that is equipped with similar
   aircraft or performs a similar mission.
   4.8.7. Centrally managed IRs will be attached for training to a Reserve unit upon the
   functional manager’s approval and RMG Detachment PM implementation.
   4.8.8. Do not designate a Military Advisory Assistance Group as a unit of attachment.
4.9. IDT Duration. The length of each IDT coincides with the local duty hours. Base IDT on a
4-hour minimum for the award of one point, not to exceed two points per calendar day. Each
member is required to be present for duty at the start of each TP. The 4-hour period does not
include meal breaks. Paid IDT periods shall not be under 4 hours. Points only IDT periods shall
not be under 2 hours.
   4.9.1. The RMG Detachment PM may designate activities for which the member may
   accumulate time spent (over 1 or more days) until reaching the 4-hour standard for one
   point. A member assigned to Air Force Office of Special Investigations may perform
   IDT by the cumulative method of time accounting for a maximum of 16 paid TPs per
   R/R.
   4.9.2. For members performing IDT on a mid-shift basis (shift starts 1 calendar day and ends
   on the next calendar day), award two points for completing 8 or more consecutive hours of
AFI36-2254V1_482FWSUP_I 23 JUNE 2011                                                         39


   IDT in a 24-hour period. Firefighters and others performing 24 hour shifts are an exception.
   Shifts exceeding 12 hours must be approved by the unit commander.
   4.9.3. A member earns one non-pay point for completing a routine physical examination
   during other than regularly scheduled IDT. Give credit for one TP to a member found not
   qualified for duty under a special physical examination given during a scheduled IDT.
4.10. Equivalent Training. Unit commanders may approve ET for individuals to make up an
excused absence from a scheduled UTA. The following policies apply to ET:
   4.10.1. Use ET when an individual is approved to make up an excused absence from a
   missed UTA. ET is appropriate when the criteria specified for rescheduled training cannot
   be met. ET must be performed after the missed UTA.
   4.10.2. The training furnished during ET must meet at least the minimum standards set up

     commanders at group/wing level and above, who maintain currency in one type of
     aircraft, but have other types assigned to their units, are allowed to log AFTPs while
     flying in observer status or in a primary crew position.
     4.11.1.8. When performing consecutive or dual AFTPs, the first AFTP must be
     completed before the second is started, e.g., some flying time must be logged and four
     hours of training completed.

     when performing preflight, flight, or post flight duties in connection with an AFTP or in
     the performance of ground training, simulator training, duty, or instruction associated
     with an AGTP.
     4.11.1.10. All AFTPs are to be logged in reference to home station time, date, and
     location that the crew duty day begins. There is no requirement to average AFTP flying
     time in order to qualify for payment.
     4.11.1.11. Operations Group Commanders will establish written local procedures for the
     management of AFTPs and AGTPs to include certifying and approving payment.
     4.11.1.12. Consecutive or dual AFTPs must be approved in advance on the flight
     authorization by the Operations Group Commander, squadron commander or squadron

   weapons and tactics, and threat awareness training.
   4.11.5. Wing commanders may request a list, beyond those stated above, of additional
   activities or duties which qualify for AGTPs. Preflight activities qualify as approved ground
   training activities. If the mission is cancelled before 4 hours of duty time, other approved
   training must also be accomplished for the remainder of the period. Wing commanders may
   submit recommended additions to their respective NAF/CC for approval. Once approved,
   these additions will be revalidated each January by the appropriate NAF.
4.12. Documenting IDT Participation.

AFI36-2254V1_482FWSUP_I 23 JUNE 2011                                                          43


4.13. Reserve Personnel Actions for Involuntary Reassignment or Administrative
Discharge of Unsatisfactory Participants.
   4.13.1. After the member has been determined as an unsatisfactory participant, ensure that
   involuntary reassignment or administrative discharge is processed in compliance with AFI
   36-2115 and AFI 36-3209 respectively. Training office must be notified of the commander’s
   final determination. If the commander makes a determination that the member is an
   unsatisfactory participant, Report of Individual Personnel (RIP) must be attached to the DD
   Form 2384-1, Notice of Basic Eligibility (NOBE), in the UPRG.
   4.13.2. HQ AFRC/A1BR must terminate bonus participation prior to the MPF projecting an
   approved involuntary reassignment. The MPF will file a copy of the bonus termination RIP
   in the member’s reassignment folder.
   4.13.3. For unit members, file documents in the Commander's Personnel Information File.
   Such documents include letters, medical certificates, orders, memorandum of telephone calls,
   etc. Retention of participation documents could become critical for some administrative
   actions (i.e., discharges, demotions, recall, etc.). Retain documentation at least for the
   current, plus previous FY.
   4.13.4. For IRs, RMG will furnish the PM a list of members who failed to meet the
   minimum training category requirements outlined in Table 1.1, and members who are
   qualified for retirement, but did not earn the required 50 points in their R/R year. PMs must
   submit appropriate waivers as required in Table 1.2. The PM determines what action to take
   in accordance with AFI 36-2115, Chapter 4.
4.14. Reservist Nonparticipation.
   4.14.1. For unit reservists the commander or designated representative will be responsible
   for exercising sound judgment in authorizing excusal, ET, or rescheduling actions. A
   commander or supervisor must consider the impact on training readiness and mission
   effectiveness when considering requests for excusals.
   4.14.2. If for any reason the member fails to notify their unit commander or supervisor of the
   circumstances regarding the absence, the individual’s commander or supervisor contacts the
   individual, documenting such effort with Memorandum for Record or email. Every effort
   must be made to make personal contact during the first period of the UTA/IDT, but not later
   than the end of the UTA/IDT. If contact is made anytime during the UTA/IDT, the
   commander may excuse, unexcuse, or authorize other training as appropriate, based upon the
   merits of the case.
4.15. Palace Chase Obligators. A Palace Chase obligator who fails to satisfactorily participate
must be reported in accordance with AFI 36-3205, Applying for the Palace Chase and Palace
Front Programs, to HQ AFPC for possible recall to AD.
4.16. Illness or Injury During IDT. If a member should be injured or become ill during IDT,
they may report (if capable) to the Reserve Medical Unit (RMU) or active duty Military
Treatment Facility (MTF) where a determination on the member’s ability to complete the
UTA/IDT is made. An LOD determination must be considered when a member reports for
medical care. See AFI 36-2910, for guidance on LOD. Sick call is not provided by the RMUs.
Their mission is to train and provide physical exam support, however, they will be able to make
 44                                            AFI36-2254V1_482FWSUP_I 23 JUNE 2011


the above determination with regard to completion of UTA. Individual reservists should report
to the nearest MTF.
   4.16.1. If member is determined to not be medically capable of completing UTA/IDT based
   upon the illness or injury, the RMU/MTF should refer the member to the member’s private
   health care provider and notify the respective commander of this determination. A change to
   member’s physical profile is not necessary unless the medical/dental condition is considered
   disqualifying for continued military duty (beyond the UTA/IDT).
   4.16.2. Commanders should excuse the remaining portion of the UTA/IDT which the
   member is incapable of performing. Member will receive point credit for IDT provided the
   duration of training has met or exceeded two hours in duration (see para 4.9).

                                           Chapter 5

                                 ANNUAL TRAINING (AT)

5.1. AT. AT is a category of ADT and is used to provide structured individual and/or unit
training to Reserve Component members. AT is the minimal period of training Reserve
members must perform each year to satisfy the training requirements associated with their
Reserve assignment, exclusive of travel time. The primary purpose of AT is to provide
individual and/or unit readiness training, but AT may support active component missions and
requirements.
5.2. Eligibility for AT. See Table 1.1 for the AT authorizations and requirements. Table 2.1,
Table 2.2, and Table 2.3 show pay eligibility. A member assigned after 1 April or after the unit
completed its AT for that FY does not have to perform an AT in that FY (except those gained
from another Selected Reserve program). Commanders will determine AT schedule. For IMAs,
the supervisor will determine AT schedule in coordination with the RMG Detachment PM.
5.3. Ineligibility for AT. A member is not eligible for an AT if the member will reach
mandatory separation date or the end of their term of enlistment before the tour ends.
5.4. Travel Restrictions. Travel restrictions are contained in Table 5.1.
5.5. Travel Limitations. Limit travel to a maximum of 4-calendar days per FY. To save travel
days, supervisors may permit late reporting during the morning of the first duty day, and early
release during the afternoon on the last duty day.
5.6. Approval Authority for AT. Approval authority for AT for unit members is the unit
commander. Approval authority for IMAs is the RMG Detachment PM. For centrally managed
IRs, the PM must obtain concurrence of the member’s functional manager. RMG Detachment
PMs may delegate approval authority to Base Individual Mobilization Augmentee
Administrators (BIMAAs) for routine tours. Routine ATs are limited to normal expenses
incurred to send the IMA to their authorized training location. BIMAAs may not approve split
tours. AT funding management is still the responsibility of RMG PMs and unit commanders,
and they are held accountable for misuse.
5.7. Requesting AT.
   5.7.1. All reservists must have annual tour orders published by 30 June each FY unless
   otherwise directed by the command Financial Management Board.
   5.7.1. (482FW) All reservists must have annual tour orders published by 30 June of each
   fiscal year. For this wing, the definition of published will require that the orders have gone
   through the entire routing process and have been certified.
   5.7.2. IMAs request AT through the Air Reserve Orders Writing System-Reserve (AROWS-
   R) Final approval is by the RMG Detachment PM. AROWS-R requests input after 1 June
   must include justification/explanation for the late request for approval from RMG/CC or
   designated representative. The tour should conform with the duty hours of the unit involved,
   and be scheduled to avoid loss of a productive day due to a legal holiday.
   5.7.2. (482FW) If circumstances arise that cause the orders not to be certified in the
   AROWS-r system by 30 June, the unit commander must send a justification letter, through
 46                                              AFI36-2254V1_482FWSUP_I 23 JUNE 2011


   their respective group, to the wing commander explaining why the member’s orders should
   be approved. Approvals after the 30 June suspense will be handled on a case by case basis
   and will require compelling justification of the circumstances that caused the orders not to be
   completed as required.
   5.7.3. If a member completes an AT, but later in the same year is reassigned to a category A
   unit that would serve as a mobilized unit, and that unit has not yet had it’s AT, the Reserve
   NAF may waive the 15 day FY limitation rule so the member may train with the new unit.
   AT, including travel, may not extend from one FY to the next FY.
   5.7.4. Direct an individual to perform AT prior to the issuance of a written order only in
   unusual circumstances. The unit commander or RMG Detachment PM must give verbal
   approval prior to performance of AT.
5.8. School Substitution of AT. Members will not attend formal schools in AT status. It is not
recommended to substitute school tours for AT. However, there are circumstances when it may
be warranted. Substitutions must be approved in advance. To substitute for entire AT (exclusive
of travel days), the ADT tour must be for the same consecutive length of time as the member’s
AT requirement. Partial AT substitutions are authorized, however, the remainder of the AT
requirement must still be performed. Approval authority for substitution rests with the
RMG/CC, or designated representative, for IRs. For centrally managed IRs, the PM must obtain
concurrence of the member’s functional manager. For unit assigned reservists, approval rests
with the wing commander or higher.
5.9. AEF Substitution of AT.
   5.9.1. Substitutions must be approved in advance by the unit commander. IRs must obtain
   approval from RMG Detachment PM for the first and second substitution and thereafter
   RMG/CC. For centrally managed IMAs, the PM must obtain concurrence of the member’s
   functional manager. The excusal process may be used for after-the-fact submissions (see
   para 1.4).
   5.9.2. MPA tours in support of AEF missions may be substituted for the AT requirement if
   approved in advance. Commanders having a need for reservists to perform an AT, in
   addition to the AEF deployment, may do so only as a voluntary action. AEF tour is defined
   as any tour of duty in which an ARC member deploys in support of contingency operations.
   The member may augment base support operations for an assigned member that is forward
   deployed on an AEF tour and this is called home station support. Home station (or backfill)
   support for AEF occurs when the AD, ANG or AFRC requests an augmentee for base
   support operations to replace an assigned AD or unit member who is deployed forward in
   support of an AEF tasking. Whenever low density/high demand assets (i.e., Rivet Joint)
   participate with the AEFs, this tour falls under the definition of an AEF tour. Any member
   fulfilling the above criteria is credited with an AEF tour.
5.10. Ordering a Member to AT. The member is encouraged to volunteer for AT tours.
However, pursuant to Title 10 U.S.C., Section 12301 (b), an AT tour may be ordered
involuntarily by the commander. In such cases, the member must be given at least 30 days
advance notification.
AFI36-2254V1_482FWSUP_I 23 JUNE 2011                                                         47


5.11. Split AT. Split tours are a management tool allowing Reserve unit commanders or PMs to
split a member’s AT when it is in the best interest of the Air Force. Use split AT only to
accommodate special mission or training requirements.
    5.11.1. Do not schedule tours of ADT, ADOS, or split tours of AT with IDT solely for the
    purpose of reimbursing members for travel to or from the place of IDT. For IMAs, the
    supervisor must provide justification for the split tour in the remarks section of the order
    request (for travel limitations see para 5.4). For IMAs, IDTs may be performed with split AT
    tours a maximum of 2 times per FY when travel is involved.
    5.11.2. An IMA may not perform a split tour when travel overseas is involved (except
    Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and posessions). The assigned/attached unit commander may
    request an exception by submitting full justification to member’s RMG PM who will forward
    to RMG/CC for approval. For centrally managed IRs, the PM must obtain concurrence of
    the member’s functional manager.
    5.11.3. AT for the unit program is the responsibility of the unit commander. Unit
    commanders will establish and maintain a written method for tracking each member who
    splits their AT. Unit commanders may delegate down to branch chiefs the authorization to
    monitor, project, and report any discrepancies to the unit commander for waiver
    approval/disapproval.

NUMBERS IN PARENTESIS REFERENCE NOTES
NOTES:
1. Except when this table authorizes, a commander may not order a member to duty and then
place the member on temporary duty (TDY) at another location for the full period of ADT,
ADOS, or AT. When a member reports to a location for the sole purpose of transportation to
an ADT, ADOS, or AT training site, the AD order must contain reporting instructions in the
"Remarks" section (see note 3 for the deployment of unit on AT).
2. A training requirement programmed in advance is primarily mission related and
independent of the individual member who is to receive the training. Also, program travel
funds in advance (included in the current year appropriation) to support such a requirement.
For an MA assigned to a general officer position, send a request for advanced approval to
AF/RESOMO, through HQ ARPC/DP.
3. Include time required for unit deployments in the duration of AT and credit toward the 14
day requirement.
4. Waiver Authority: IMAs assigned/attached to overseas locations do not require a waiver to
travel to their unit. For ATs at a location other than the assigned/attached unit, a waiver is
required. For IMAs not assigned to overseas locations, the PM must provide justification to
HQ RMG/CC for approval, unless the agency requesting overseas training uses military air
space available travel or otherwise funds the overseas travel and per diem. Justifications must
include unique nature of training and reasons why similar training cannot be provided at unit
of assignment/attachment or without incurring overseas travel.
5. Variations in itinerary are not to be used in lieu of adequate planning, nor is it interpreted as
granting blanket travel authorization. They should be authorized only when essential for
training or the success of the mission. Do not authorize variations in an order when the
purpose is to attend a school or course of instruction except when unspecified field trips or
flight training courses are required and authorized in the training outline or education and
training      course     announcements         that      can     only     be       accessed       at
http://hq2af.keesler.af.mil/ETCA.HTM. The approval authority cited in the AF IMT 1289,
Application for Active Duty Training (RPA Tour), section IV, and web orders transaction
system request must provide justification for "Variations in Itinerary" or travel to more than
one location and forward with the AT application. Variations required after publication of
orders are the responsibility of the unit and will be accomplished using DD Form 1610,
Request and Authorization for TDY Travel of DoD Personnel.

                                          Chapter 6

                ACTIVE DUTY FOR OPERATIONAL SUPPORT (ADOS)

6.1. Definition ADOS. ADOS can refer to both RPA and MPA tours. ADOS tours may be
used for projects that directly support Reserve component programs in which training for the
member itself is not the primary objective, but a significant outcome. ADOS projects include
annual screening, unit conversion to new weapons systems, projects supporting study groups,
training sites and exercises, short-term mission projects, administrative support functions,
conferences, staff visits, and counter drug tours.
6.2. AD Sanctuary. ―Sanctuary‖ means that any member who attains 18 (but less than 20)
years of AD while serving on AD (other than for training) must be retained on AD unless
voluntarily separated, is medically disqualified for continued service, or is separated or
discharged for cause. Members must waive sanctuary entitlement prior to the beginning of an
AD tour (other than for training) of less than 180 days, or the member may not be authorized to
perform the tour. To provide oversight, AROWS-R initiates a Commander’s Hard Hold for
approval of Active Duty Orders if the member has more than 16.5 years Total Active Federal
Military Service (TAFMS). Sanctuary Statements of Understanding will be required for
members performing ADOS (other than for training) tours that have accrued 16.5 years of
TAFMS. See AFI 36-2131, Administration of Sanctuary in the Air Reserve Components).
6.3. Eligibility ADOS.
   6.3.1. Only members in training categories A, B, E, and J (see Table 2.1 and Table 2.2) are
   authorized to take part in ADOS tours. FY requirements (Table 1.1) will be performed,
   scheduled, substituted, or waived prior to a member performing an ADOS tour. On ADOS
   orders requests, the requester will place the statement ―All FY requirements of Table 1.1, of
   this instruction have been performed, scheduled, substituted, or waived.‖
   6.3.2. Members who belong to the ORS, NARS, ISLRS, the Retired Reserve, or NNRPS
   may not take part in ADOS tours. A member of NARS who has been transferred from the
   Ready Reserve because the member is a key employee may take part in ADT and ADOS as
   long as it is at no cost to the government.
   6.3.3. End-strength accounting laws limit Air Force reservists serving on mandays. In
   accordance with the FY05 National Defense Authorization Act, reservists serving on ADOS
   mandays for Operational Support, for a cumulative period exceeding 1,095 mandays
   (includes both MPA and RPA) in the previous 1,460-calendar day period (3 years in the last
   4), must be counted on the Air Force AD end-strength. NOTE: The 4-year period is a
   revolving time frame. The same as that used for Personnel Tempo accounting. The change
   in law does not apply to general officers, who are still restricted by direction of AF/RE.
       6.3.3.1. ADOS is defined as all AD under Title 10 U.S.C., Section 12301(d) (except
       Active Guard/Reserve (AGR) duty and periods of mobilization); and ADT performed at
       the direction of an organizational or operational commander (active or reserve); or as a
       result of reimbursable funding. All other forms of training AT; IADT; and school Tours
       (ADT), are exempt from the count. Presidential Recall and mobilization are exempt IAW
       Title 10 U.S.C. Section 12302, and are not considered ADOS. All other ADOS periods
AFI36-2254V1_482FWSUP_I 23 JUNE 2011                                                           51


       are counted. The 1,095 day count is retroactive to 28 October 2004. Days served prior to
       that date are not considered.
       6.3.3.2. The cumulative periods of AD performed by the member exceeding 1,095 days
       in the previous 1,460 days, are accountable against AD strengths (active component, or
       AGR end strength, consistent with pay appropriations) when the 1,095 day threshold is
       crossed, pursuant to Title 10 U. S. C., Section 115. A member whose order to AD that
       specifies a period of greater than 3 years shall be included in the strength authorized, as
       stated above, commencing on the first day of the orders.
6.4. Training Category Codes (TCC). Commanders or their designated representatives have
the authority to determine the appropriate TCC to be used for ADOS tours and must make sure
appropriate TCCs are placed on all ADOS orders. The TCCs are listed in Attachment 2.
6.5. Scheduling ADOS Tours.
   6.5.1. Schedule ADOS tours to conform with the local duty hours. Tours are usually
   planned to coincide with the availability of training supervisors, aircraft, or equipment.
   Reservists on ADOS for a period of time for which the requirement will overlap holidays or
   weekends, must be on continuous orders until completion of training or requirement. This
   does not negate the requirement for any necessary manday waiver authority. Under no
   circumstances are members performing tours of ADOS to be taken off of orders during
   holidays or weekends and returned on orders the following duty day to resume augmentation
   for the same duty/project. This is to ensure no disruption of associated benefits and
   entitlements to protect the member and his/her family members.
   6.5.2. Under no circumstances should ADOS be combined with IDT solely for the purpose
   of providing travel expenses to the IDT location. Commanders and supervisors should
   ensure that all ADOS tours performed in conjunction with IDT can be substantiated by a
   valid support or training requirement.
   6.5.3. Accrued leave days used (not sold and paid back to the member) during ADOS count
   against the 1095/1460 and MA tour maximums. ADOS for RPA tours will not be used in
   combination with any other MPA, and will not be used for the same mission. In other words,
   Air Force MAJCOMs, units, or agencies cannot circumvent manpower authorization levels
   through continuous manday application, using a combination of ADT and ADOS (RPA and
   MPA). AFI 36-2619, Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA) Manday Program, provides
   further guidance.
   6.5.4. ADOS tours will be processed through AROWS-R. IMAs will submit an orders
   request electronically through AROWS-R at least 30 days before the tour start date for
   publication of orders.
   6.5.5. Procedures for Officers in MA positions.
       6.5.5.1. An MA general officer or colonel, who is assigned to an MA general officer
       position, must process a request for an ADT or ADOS tour to HQ ARPC/DP for action.
       6.5.5.2. An AF Form 1289, a letter or message containing all the same pertinent data,
       including the primary point of contact (name and telephone number), may be used to
       request an ADT or ADOS tour.
 52                                             AFI36-2254V1_482FWSUP_I 23 JUNE 2011


       6.5.5.3. Special tour funds to support an MA general officer position are monitored by
       HQ ARPC/DPAO. Except in an emergency or unusual situation, a tour request that
       contains a variation in itinerary should arrive at HQ ARPC/DP at least 30 days before the
       tour start date.
       6.5.5.4. Send a copy of all orders of MAs who are in commander and general officer
       positions to HQ USAF/RESOMO.
       6.5.5.5. Send a copy of all ADOS orders on HQ AFRC commanders in general officer
       positions to HQ USAF/RESOMO.
6.6. Specific ADOS Tour Exceptions.
   6.6.1. Procedures for Counter Drug Tours.
       6.6.1.1. HQ AFRC/A3OU is funded by DoD with a separate counter drug account.
       Expenditures from this account can only be authorized by HQ AFRC/A3.
       6.6.1.2. If approved the tour is charged to the AROWS-R work center code for counter
       drug tours and forwarded to HQ AFRC/A3 for personnel selection process, coordination,
       and approval.
   6.6.2. Special Restrictions on Utilization of RPA ADT in Conjunction With Commercial or
   Contract Activities. When OJT or proficiency training is available only through participation
   with a commercial, contract activity:
       6.6.2.1. Conduct the training under the supervision of a qualified trainer designated by
       the applicable performance work statement.
       6.6.2.2. The reservist's military or Department of the Air Force civilian supervisor
       certifies duty pay.
6.7. Action Taken on Completion of ADOS Tour. A Statement of Tour of Duty, AF IMT 938
(computer-generated or hard copy), must be signed by the member, certified by the member
supervising training, and sent to the member's designated RPO within 5-workdays after the tour
is completed.

have faithfully defended our Nation. MFH consists of (at a minimum) the folding and
presentation of the national flag and the playing of Taps.
7.2. Definition of FHD. FHD is the term used for duty or training associated with the
performance/provision of MFHs.
   7.2.1. Responsibility for MFH/FHD. HQ AFRC/A1 is the command function that provides
   command oversight and program management. AFSVA/CCR is designated to provide
   oversight for IRs, including centralized MPA Mandays for volunteer support.
   7.2.2. Program management and procedures for conducting FHD can be found in AFI 34-
   242, Mortuary Affairs Program.
7.3. Eligibility to Perform FHD.
   7.3.1. Only AFRC members in training categories A, B, and E are authorized to participate
   in FHD.
   7.3.2. FHD Status. Within the AFRC, a period of inactive duty status may be used expressly
   for satisfying FHD and/or preparation for FHD. Although support of FHD is authorized for
   the Ready Reserve, command determination has limited FHD to members in the Selected
   Reserve and PIRR based on practical use of its resources. Although FHD status is a form of
   inactive duty, it is not to be confused with IDT. No TPs will be used in support of FHD.
7.4. Use of FHD Status (Inactive Duty).
   7.4.1. Use of FHD status in the AFRC for the purpose of providing FHD support is strictly
   voluntary and may be paid or nonpaid.
   7.4.2. Election of performing FHD in paid status entitles volunteer to 1 day base pay for
   each day of FHD and/or preparation for FHD.
   7.4.3. Use of FHD status in the AFRC entitles volunteer to one retirement point for each day
   FHD and/or preparation for FHD is performed. Retirement points earned in support of FHD
   can exceed the 130 point limitation for retirement currently restricted for each member’s R/R
   year. For accounting purposes, this retirement point will be tracked separately under
   PCARS.
7.5. Authorization for FHD Status.
   7.5.1. Members in the Ready Reserve will be authorized to perform in FHD status via AF
   IMT 40b.
       7.5.1.1. FHD status is restricted to no less than 2 hours for each day FHD and/or
       preparation for FHD is performed.
       7.5.1.2. For AFRC, use of the FHD status will be limited to members who reside within
       50 miles of the site where FHD is to be performed, or where they are to be trained. Any
 54                                              AFI36-2254V1_482FWSUP_I 23 JUNE 2011


       FHD training or duty 50 miles or beyond the participant’s residence is to be performed
       via MPA mandays to be provided by the Air Force Services Agency (AFSVA/CCR).
   7.5.2. AF IMT 40b will be used to submit for pay (if elected) and points.
       7.5.2.1. AF IMT 40b should be submitted to member’s respective RPO, with copy to unit
       commander or PM (IR). A copy of this form should be provided to AFSVA/CCR for
       accounting purposes as well.
       7.5.2.2. One AF IMT 40b will suffice for consecutive days in which FHD is performed.
   7.5.3. There is no limitation (other than fiscal constraints) on the number of FHD
   opportunities that may be performed by any one member in the Ready Reserve.
   7.5.4. FHD status will not be used to substitute for any statutory participation requirement.
   7.5.5. Standard Form 1164, Claims for Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official
   Business (http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/eforms/sf1164o.pdf), may be
   submitted for reimbursment for travel in conjunction with FHD.
7.6. Status of AFRC Members Conducting MFH. MFH and preparation for MFH may be
performed in variety of military status. ARTs are permitted to perform FHD, but cannot do so
on official time (Civil Service Status). ARTs must be in a military status other than IDT, ADT,
or AT. ARTs will not be permitted to use military leave to perform in FHD status, however,
military leave is permitted if the ART is performing FHD in an AD capacity other than for
training (MPA mandays). All statuses listed below are permitted to perform FHD.
   7.6.1. AGR status. AGR members may perform FHD similar in manner as AD members
   currently support FHD (additional duty).
       7.6.1.1. AGR members are not entitled FHD compensation. They draw their normal pay
       and allowances for the duty day in which FHD is performed.
       7.6.1.2. AGR members will be entitled to travel (unless government transportation is
       provided) and per diem expenses in support of FHD or preparation for FHD.
       7.6.1.3. AGR members will be put on travel orders in support of FHD. Lodging and per
       diem is authorized if overnight travel is necessary to preposition member for FHD or if
       FHD extends beyond normal duty hours (including travel to and from FHD site).
   7.6.2. MPA Mandays. Only AFRC members in training categories A, B, and E (see Table
   2.1 and Table 2.2) are authorized to take part in ADOS tours. Thereby, only AFRC
   members in these training categories may use ADOS to support FHD. For the sake of clarity,
   this ADOS for FHD is limited to MPA mandays, which will be provided by AFSVA/CCR.
   7.6.3. MPA authority is subject to limitations outlined in AFI 36-2619.
       7.6.3.1. Members on an MPA tour not for FHD are not entitled the FHD compensation
       authorized for members performing in FHD status. They draw their normal pay and
       allowances for the duty day in which FHD is performed.
       7.6.3.2. Members on MPA tour to support FHD will be entitled to travel (unless
       government transportation is provided) and per diem expenses. Lodging and per diem is
       authorized if overnight travel is necessary to preposition member for FHD or if FHD
       extends beyond normal duty hours (including travel to and from FHD site).

                                   PROGRESSION TOURS

8.1. AFRC Progression Tours. A “progression tour‖ outlines the training an aircrew requires
to become mission ready. Progression tours include initial qualification/re-qualification (as
appropriate) training, mission qualification training, and seasoning. The intent of a progression
tour is to allow an aircrew to be placed on continuous orders and ensure they are mission ready.
A progression tour also allows a wing to forecast funding in their Financial Plan (FINPLAN) or
through an Unfunded Requirement (UFR) as appropriate.
   8.1.1. Direct all questions concerning progression tours to HQ AFRC/A3.
   8.1.2. As the training class days change frequently with new/deleted syllabus requirements,
   progression tour tables for all aircrew qualifying for progression tours will be located at the
   AFRC/A3T website.
   8.1.3. The order of the courses listed in the tables is an outline for planning purposes only.
   Units may prefer a certain order of course attendance concerning survival schools and
   weapons systems specific school. This should be clearly identified on the unit training
   request to their wing/DPMT. Units should remain flexible in their expectations of course
   alignment. It may not be possible to accommodate all requests due to the lack of availability
   of training slots. Additionally, units should plan for the possibility of short breaks between
   courses to make the most efficient use of their days allocated.
   8.1.4. The student’s unit of assignment will prepare one progression tour order after
   submitting a single AF Form 101, Reserve Requirements for School Tours of Active Duty
   for Training. Upon completion of each school/training, a new DD Form 1610, Request and
   Authorization for TDY Travel of DoD Personnel, will be cut for the next training. The
   total combined length of the orders should not exceed the time identified in the table listed in
   the tables on the A3TB website unless there are breaks in training that need to be addressed.
   8.1.5. Progression tours are authorized for in-unit training. In-unit training should only be
   used when formal training is unavailable. Units should have student’s complete academic
   training at a formal school if a formal school can accommodate only this portion of the
   training. Utilize the applicable training days authorized for the specific training in the tables
   listed on the A3 website when forecasting for progression tour unit funding for in-unit
   training. Units will ensure they will be authorized to allow a student to accomplish in-unit
   training before requesting progression tour funding.
   8.1.6. If the number of training days for a particular training course listed on a table at the
   A3TB website is different from the number of days listed in the Education and Training
   Course Announcement (ETCA) (https://etca.randolph.af.mil), the days listed in ETCA will
   take precedence.
8.2. Progression Tour Funding. Progression tours are a combination of school tour funds for
formal schools that are issued a TLN and special tour funds for all other training to include
seasoning. Orders will be identified using TCC "FA" for the formal UPT/UNT school portion
and TCC ―FD‖ for the unit funded continuation portion.
AFI36-2254V1_482FWSUP_I 23 JUNE 2011                                                                 57


    8.2.1. Units must submit progression tour requirements to their wing/FM in their annual
    FINPLAN for special tour funds. Wings will use the applicable table and aircrew position
    located on the AFRC/A3TB website under ―Progression Tour‖ tables to determine the
    number of days authorized for progression tours.
    8.2.2. When requirements occur outside of the normal financial planning process and cannot
    be forecasted in the units FINPLAN, wings will submit UFR to the appropriate NAF. The
    NAF/FM will review the UFR for possible realignment of funds within the NAF. If the
    NAF/FM can not fund the requirement an out of cycle UFR may be submitted to HQ
    AFRC/FMAR for consideration.
8.3. Eligibility for Progression Tours. Progression tours do not include aircrew who are
upgrading to instructor, flight examiner, or flight lead status. Upgrade training to an instructor,
evaluator, or flight lead is not part of the flying transition training school tour and thus not part of
a progression tour. EXCEPTION: Aircrew joining Flight Training Units (FTUs) are allowed
progression tour funding for instructor training if required.
8.4. Student Progression in Training. Each wing is responsible for monitoring the students
training progression. Progression tours should be accomplished on a continuing basis. If an
aircrew member is unable to complete the required training within the number of days identified
on the A3 Web Site (https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=RC-OP-02-
97), the wing will contact HQ AFRC/FMAR for the additional expense. A student's progress
will be reported in the unit's Training Review Panel.
    8.4.1. Any time a student’s formal school training is extended for any reason, the respective
    wing training office must be notified.
    8.4.2. The wing training office will then coordinate with HQ AFRC/A1 any required
    additional school tour funding to cover the extended period. Students completing formal
    training earlier than anticipated must notify the wing training office who will then notify HQ
    AFRC/A1TF who monitors return of unused funds.
8.5. Breaks in Training. If there is a large break (30 days or more) between the graduation date
of UPT/UNT and the first formal class, the unit, at the discretion of the wing commander, may
elect to have the individual begin training at home station. Breaks in training may require an
individual to remain in-place to ensure perishable skills are not lost and facilitate refresher
training until the next training course becomes available. This period of training is in excess of
the progression tour requirements and will therefore be an additional expense to the unit.
8.6. Unsatisfactory Student Performance. If a student is not progressing satisfactorily or
meeting the required milestones while on a progression tour, a review board from the unit must
be convened to review that individuals training. If it is decided that there are no mitigating
factors that have led to the unsatisfactory progression, the individual will be dropped from the
progression tour.
8.7. Seasoning. Wing’s are allowed to season an aircrew after completing formal qualification
courses.
    8.7.1. An aircrew who receives an ART or AGR position after their initial qualification or
    re-qualification training while in their mission qualification will not be authorized seasoning
    days.
 58                                             AFI36-2254V1_482FWSUP_I 23 JUNE 2011


   8.7.2. Information for seasoning days for each weapon system’s authorized progression tours
   are at the AFRC/A3TB website.
   8.7.3. The number of seasoning days referenced in the table located at the AFRC/A3 website
   is the maximum number of seasoning days authorized. An aircrew does not have to utilize
   all their seasoning days. Commanders may split seasoning days into manageable blocks to
   maximize training.
   8.7.4. The unit training monitor will ensure seasoning days are well utilized to ensure the
   student becomes mission qualified.
8.8. Mission Qualification Training (MQT). MQT encompasses the days required to
complete all ground, flying, and simulator training. It will also cover all unit indoctrination
training. MQT will normally be conducted by the unit of assignment after the aircrew has
completed their initial formal training. MQT will ensure the aircrew is fully mission capable to
accomplish the mission unsupervised.
