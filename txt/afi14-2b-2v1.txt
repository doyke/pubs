        1.1.1.1. Develop baseline training materials for Initial Qualification Training (IQT),
        Mission Qualification Training (MQT), Continuation Training (CT), and Specialized
        Training (ST) (e.g., Capabilities Briefs, Visual Recognition (VR), and Threat of the Day
        (TOD) materials, exercise scenarios, training scenarios, etc.). B-2 unit Senior
        Intelligence Officers (SIO) are authorized to modify the baseline training materials to
        meet unit needs.
        1.1.1.2. Develop and maintain a B-2 Intelligence Master Question File (MQF).
        Coordinate with other organizations to obtain inputs, as required. Periodically review
        MQF questions to certify clarity, accuracy of content and relevance to B-2 unit missions.
        B-2 unit SIOs are authorized to augment the baseline MQF with locally generated
        questions to meet unit needs.
        1.1.1.3. Chair a biennial training conference to review B-2 unit intelligence training
        requirements and programs. Conference participants will include applicable active and
        air reserve component (ARC) representatives.
        1.1.1.4. Act as the waiver authority for specific intelligence training requirements
        outlined in this publication. Courtesy copy AF/A2D on any waiver correspondence.
        1.1.1.5. Coordinate with other MAJCOMs, as applicable, on B-2 intelligence training
        involving participation of non-AFGSC organizations in support of global strike mission
        execution.
     1.1.2. All user MAJCOMs will:
        1.1.2.1. Determine specialized combat mission qualification requirements to meet unit
        Operations Plan (OPLAN)/Concept Plan (CONPLAN) tasks exist and coordinate with
        AFGSC/A2 for supporting training materials as needed.

     SIO will:
        1.1.3.1. Ensure programs are developed and executed to meet combat mission
        qualification requirements for B-2 intelligence. Provide guidance to flying squadron
        intelligence and subordinate units regarding execution of training. (T-2)
AFI14-2B-2V1 30 January 2012                                                                 5


      1.1.3.2. Appoint in writing an Intelligence Personnel Training Program Manager to
      oversee program execution. Where assigned, the USAF Intelligence Weapons Instructor
      Course graduate will provide input into the training programs. (T-3)
      1.1.3.3. Designate the qualification to which each intelligence position will train. Upon
      request, provide MAJCOM/A2 and operational commander(s), as appropriate, with a list
      of Basic Mission Capable (BMC) and Combat Mission Ready (CMR) manning positions.
      (T-2)
      1.1.3.4. Review programs and manning position designations annually. (T-3)
      1.1.3.5. Monitor currencies and training requirements for all assigned/attached
      intelligence personnel. Assigned Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMA) will be
      trained and equipped to established command standards for the positions they will
      assume. (T-2)
      1.1.3.6. Ensure personnel accomplish ancillary training IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force
      Training Program. Consult with the local unit training manager and Unit Deployment
      Manager for ancillary training requirements specific to the unit and base. (T-3)
      1.1.3.7. Ensure intelligence personnel are under the direct supervision of qualified and
      current intelligence personnel when required to participate in operational events or
      perform tasks for which they are not qualified and current. (T-2)
      1.1.3.8. Identify and report to MAJCOM/A2 any training shortfalls that have negative
      impact on operations. (T-3)
   1.1.4. The unit Intelligence Personnel Training Program Manager will:
      1.1.4.1. Develop intelligence personnel training programs with written guidance
      detailing how the program will be conducted. Design training programs to achieve the
      highest degree of mission readiness consistent with safety and resource availability.
      Training must balance the need for realism against the expected threat, unit mission and
      capabilities. (T-2)
      1.1.4.2. Ensure that unit intelligence mission qualification training is executed with
      sufficient frequency, consistency and accuracy, IAW standards approved by the SIO, to
      ensure personnel knowledge, skills and abilities relevant to the B-2 mission remain
      current. (T-2)
      1.1.4.3. Use lead MAJCOM-developed training materials to assist in the development
      and conduct of unit training programs, as applicable. (T-3)
      1.1.4.4. Review training and evaluation records of newly-assigned intelligence personnel
      and those completing formal training to determine the training required for them to
      achieve CMR or BMC status and to ensure provisions of this instruction have been met.
      (T-2)
      1.1.4.5. Monitor intelligence personnel currencies and requirements and
      notify/coordinate with individual’s chain-of-command on all combat mission
      qualification issues, to include delays, BMC/CMR status, and selection for upgrade
      training. (T-2)
 6                                                               AFI14-2B-2V1 30 January 2012


        1.1.4.6. Provide a written evaluation of the intelligence personnel training program to the
        SIO at the end of each training cycle. Submit reports as required by local procedures for
        tracking overall training status of intelligence personnel. (T-3)
     1.1.5. Individual intelligence personnel will:
        1.1.5.1. Complete training and maintain currency requirements within the guidelines of
        this instruction. (T-2)
        1.1.5.2. Notify supervisor of any issues that affect training events, qualification status, or
        the ability to participate in MQT or CT. (T-2)
        1.1.5.3. Only participate in operational activities for which they are qualified and current,
        unless under the direct supervision of qualified and current intelligence personnel. (T-2)
        1.1.5.4. Hand-carry a digital copy of qualification training and evaluation records when
        changing station or assignment to assist the gaining unit in assessing qualifications and
        training requirements. (T-3)
1.2. Qualification Training. Qualification training programs are designed to progress
intelligence personnel from IQT to MQT in order to achieve BMC or CMR status, which will be
maintained via continuation training and validated by periodic intelligence evaluations.
Qualification training is separate from skill- level upgrade training, although qualification
training may fulfill some skill- level upgrade training requirements.
     1.2.1. IQT provides the initial training necessary to qualify intelligence personnel for basic
     duties in an intelligence position without regard to a unit’s specific mission. Upon
     completion of IQT, intelligence personnel attain Basic Qualification (BQ) status. BQ is not a
     long-term qualification status. IQT is discussed further in Chapter 2 of this instruction.
     1.2.2. MQT provides the training necessary to qualify or re-qualify intelligence personnel in
     a specific duty position to perform the missions assigned to a unit. BQ is a prerequisite for
     MQT; intelligence personnel maintain BQ status until they complete MQT. Completion of
     MQT is a prerequisite for both BMC and CMR status. MQT is discussed more extensively
     in Chapter 3 of this instruction.
     1.2.3. Continuation Training provides the volume, frequency and mix of training necessary
     for intelligence personnel to maintain proficiency, currency and qualification. The Ready
     Intelligence Program (RIP) is designed to focus training on capabilities needed to accomplish
     a unit’s core tasked missions. CT is separate from skill-level upgrade training, although CT
     may fulfill some skill-level upgrade training requirements. CT and RIP are discussed further
     in Chapter 4 of this instruction.
     1.2.4. Specialized Training (ST) addresses skills necessary to carry out a unit’s assigned
     missions but are not required for every intelligence unit member. ST is accomplished after
     the member has attained BMC or CMR status, and is in addition to BMC or CMR
     requirements. ST is discussed further in Chapter 5 of this instruction.
1.3. Position Qualification. The SIO will designate intelligence positions as either BMC or
CMR. All personnel must maintain at least BMC qualification; flying squadron intelligence
personnel will be CMR. (T-2)
AFI14-2B-2V1 30 January 2012                                                                7


   1.3.1. Basic Mission Capable (BMC) is the status of intelligence personnel who have
   satisfactorily completed MQT, are qualified in the unit mission, but do not maintain the
   same frequency of training as those in CMR status. BMC personnel are typically those who
   primarily perform wing supervision or staff functions that directly support intelligence
   operations. Personnel must be able to attain CMR currency within 30 days.
      1.3.1.1. BMC personnel must maintain currencies by accomplishing all designated tasks
      within the prescribed timelines. See Chapter 4, Tables 4.1 and 4.2, for RIP currency
      requirements and Chapter 5, Table 5.1, for Specialized Training currency requirements.
      Failure to complete BMC-required training results in regression to non-BMC (N-BMC)
      status. While N-BMC, personnel may only perform individual tasks in which they are
      current and qualified. (T-2)
   1.3.2. Combat Mission Ready (CMR) refers to the status of intelligence personnel who have
   satisfactorily completed MQT and maintain qualification and currency in the mission
   qualification tasks and knowledge outlined in this instruction.
      1.3.2.1. CMR intelligence personnel must maintain currency by accomplishing all
      designated tasks within the prescribed timelines. See Chapter 4, Table 4.1, for RIP
      currency requirements and Chapter 5, Table 5.1, for ST currency requirements. Failure
      to complete this training or maintain these currencies will result in regression to non-
      CMR (N-CMR) status unless waived by the SIO. While N-CMR, personnel may perform
      only individual tasks in which they are current and qualified. (T-2)
      1.3.2.2. Intelligence personnel must be CMR to support a B-2 deployment in support of a
      conflict. At the discretion of the SIO, a unit may deploy any current and qualified
      individual on deployments not tied to an active conflict. (T-2)
          1.3.2.2.1. Joint Expeditionary Taskings (JET). Currency requirements are not
          applicable for JET deployment outside an individual’s assigned airframe.
   1.3.3. N-BMC/N-CMR. Intelligence personnel who regress to N-BMC or N-CMR status
   must accomplish the requirements IAW Chapter 4 before being returned to BMC or CMR
   status. (T-2)
1.4. Documentation. All intelligence training must be documented. Units will document
training on the AF Form 4381, Intelligence Gradesheet, and in coordination with AF/A2
approved processes regarding on-line documentation. (T-2)
 8                                                                 AFI14-2B-2V1 30 January 2012


                                              Chapter 2

                            INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General. This chapter outlines IQT for B-2 unit intelligence personnel. IQT for
intelligence personnel begins after initial skills training is completed (i.e., the Air Force Specialty
Code awarding courses) and will consist of the Global Strike Intelligence Formal Training Unit
(IFTU). In exceptional circumstances, when IFTU training is not available within a reasonable
time period, the IFTU portion of IQT may be conducted at the local unit. Local IQT will be
conducted by unit intelligence training personnel using the Global Strike IFTU syllabus and
training courseware provided by AFGSC/A2. After successful completion of the IFTU course,
the individual has met the training requirements for Basic Qualification (BQ). The following
guidance only applies to training other than the formal Global Strike IFTU IQT course. (T-2)
2.2. Waiver approval for in-unit IQT. AFGSC/A2 is approval authority to conduct in-unit
IQT. All user MAJCOMs will route waiver requests through AFGSC/A2Q. Requests to conduct
local IQT will include: (T-2)
     2.2.1. Justification for the in-unit training in lieu of formal course training attendance.
     2.2.2. Summary of the individual’s intelligence career field experience.
     2.2.3. Date training will begin and expected completion date.
     2.2.4. Requested exceptions to the formal course syllabus, with rationale.
2.3. Prerequisites. Course prerequisites will be IAW the appropriate formal course syllabus
and the USAF Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA). (T-2)

                          MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. MQT is training necessary to qualify intelligence personnel in assigned duty
positions supporting B-2 missions/operations. Guidance in this chapter is provided to assist SIOs
in developing and executing their MQT program. MQT execution will take into account the
assigned duty position, current qualifications, prior experience, currency, documented
performance and/or formal training of each individual. MQT can be accomplished through
internal training sessions, external courses, or one-on-one instruction from a qualified trainer or
supervisor. Applicable portions of MQT will be used to create a re-qualification program for
personnel who have regressed from BMC/CMR to specifically address deficiencies which
caused regression. (T-2)
3.2. Timelines. MQT should typically begin upon completion of IQT, however in special
situations determined by the SIO, intelligence personnel may begin MQT before completion of
IQT and award of BQ status where training events and timelines make this option practical.
MQT will be completed within the time specified below. (T-2)
   3.2.1. MQT timing starts within 60 days (90 days for IMAs) of the individual’s first duty day
   at the gaining unit. If the individual has not attended the IFTU and will complete local IQT,
   MQT will begin no later than 90 days after arrival or after the completion of IQT. If
   personnel take leave prior to being entered into MQT, the timing will begin on the first duty
   day upon returning from leave. For first term airmen being entered into MQT, the timing
   will begin upon completion of the First Term Airman Course (or equivalent) at their gaining
   unit. MQT is complete upon successful accomplishment of MQT tasks, a successful INIT
   MSN evaluation IAW AFI 14-2B-2, Volume 2, and AFI 14-202, Volume 2, and SIO
   certification to BMC or CMR, as appropriate. (T-2)
   3.2.2. For Active Duty personnel, MQT will be completed within 120 days.                 Notify
   MAJCOM/A2 if training exceeds this timeline. (T-2)
   3.2.3. For IMAs and reserve personnel, notify MAJCOM IMA Program Manager and
   AFRC/A2 if training exceeds 180 calendar days. Assigned IMAs will be trained and
   equipped to established command standards for the positions they will assume. (T-2)
   3.2.4. MAJCOM/A2s will consolidate unit reporting of personnel exceeding allowable times
   lines and notify AFGSC/A2 on an annual basis. (T-2)
3.3. Training Completion and Qualification. Completion of MQT tasks will be annotated on
the AF Form 4381, Intelligence Gradesheet IAW AF/A2 guidance regarding online
documentation. Specific B-2 MQT Intelligence Gradesheet task elements are listed in
Attachment 4. (T-2)
   3.3.1. Personnel are certified BMC/CMR upon successful completion of MQT, a successful
   initial mission qualification evaluation (INIT MSN) IAW AFI 14-202, Volume 2, and AFI
   14-2B-2, Volume 2, and endorsement from the SIO. Reference AFI 14-2B-2, Volume 2, for
   a more detailed explanation of evaluations. (T-2)

       4.2.3.9. Debriefing – to include theater specific requirements, techniques and applicable
       follow on questions.
       4.2.3.10. Reporting – to include theater intelligence reporting directives, software
       applications and transmitting.
       4.2.3.11. Personnel Recovery (PR) – to include theater specific techniques, academics,
       ISOPREP requirements, and EPA requirements.
       4.2.3.12. Force Protection (FP) – to include intelligence principles and procedures for
       force protection; summary of hostile forces in AOR and other hot spot areas; examples of
       hostile forces tactics and weapons employment; intelligence FP resources; terrorist threat
       levels; unit FP considerations.
   4.2.4. Internal intelligence training examinations will be compiled from the MQF, as a
   minimum. The Intelligence Personnel Training Program Manager should augment the MQF
   with specific questions relevant to the unit’s mission. (T-2)
4.3. Ready Intelligence Program. The RIP consists of specific mission-related training
required to accomplish the unit’s tasked missions. The intent of RIP is to ensure intelligence
personnel perform specific mission-essential tasks with sufficient frequency to maintain
proficiency in their duty positions. In order to maximize training opportunities and minimize
artificiality, RIP tasks should be conducted in conjunction with day-to-day missions as much as
possible. Individuals are responsible for documenting RIP task completion. (T-2)
   4.3.1. The standard task requirements listed in Tables 4.1 and 4.2, B-2 Ready Intelligence
   Program Currency Requirements, establish the minimum frequency requirement for BMC
   and CMR personnel. Failure to accomplish these requirements will affect the individual’s
   BMC or CMR currency status. Any additional training requirements will be determined by
   the SIO. (T-2)
   4.3.2. Intelligence personnel must complete appropriate RIP tasks and successfully
   accomplish periodic mission qualification evaluations (MSNs) IAW AFI 14-202, Volume 2,
   and AFI 14-2B-2, Volume 2 to maintain currency and qualification. If an intelligence
   specialist loses currency in a particular area, the individual may not perform that task
   unsupervised until currency is regained. (T-2)
4.4. Currency. Table 4.1 and Table 4.2 define frequency requirements for all intelligence
personnel required to maintain current BMC or CMR status. Intelligence personnel must
demonstrate proficiency in all delinquent RIP items with an SIO-designated supervisor to regain
currency. For example, if an individual accomplished a quarterly RIP item (e.g., Debriefing) on
15 Jan 14, he/she must accomplish that task again by 15 Jul 14 to remain current. If the task is
not completed within the specified timeframe, the individual becomes non-current and must
demonstrate proficiency of the task with an SIO-designated supervisor prior to conducting the
task unsupervised. (T-2)

Terms
Basic Mission Capable (BMC)—The status of unit intelligence personnel who have
satisfactorily completed MQT, are qualified in the unit missions but do not maintain the same
training frequency required of those in CMR status.
Basic Qualification (BQ)—The status of intelligence personnel who have satisfactorily
completed IQT and are qualified to perform basic duties, but may not perform mission duties
unsupervised. The member must perform at a minimum level as established in this volume. BQ
is not a long term qualification status.
Certification—Procedure used to document competency in a particular task. Not
interchangeable with “qualification”, which requires AF Form 4350 documentation.
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)—The status of intelligence personnel who have satisfactorily
completed MQT and maintain CMR qualification and currency as outlined in this instruction, see
Table 4.1. and Table 4.2.
Continuation Training (CT)—Continuation training provides the volume, frequency and mix
of training necessary for intelligence personnel to maintain proficiency, currency and
qualification. RIP outlines the minimum CT requirements. RIP is designed to focus training on
capabilities needed to accomplish a unit’s core tasked missions. CT is separate from skill level
upgrade training, although CT may fulfill some skill level upgrade training requirements.
Currency—A measure of how frequently and/or recently a task is completed. Currency
requirements should ensure intelligence personnel maintain a minimum level of proficiency in a
given event.
External Intelligence Trainer (EIT)—Current and qualified (CMR or BMC) intelligence
personnel who have completed the EIT Specialized Training and maintain currency as an EIT.
Only EITs may conduct unsupervised intelligence training for aircrews or other non-intelligence
AFSC personnel.
External Intelligence Trainer Evaluation—An evaluation that qualifies an individual as an
external intelligence trainer. Includes evaluations that initially qualify and requalify an
intelligence member as an external intelligence trainer (i.e., initial {INIT} EIT and
requalification {RQ} EIT) as directed in AFI14-2B-2, Volume 1. The designator for the external
intelligence trainer evaluation is “EIT” as used with the AF Form 4349 and AF Form 4350.
External Intelligence Training—Intelligence training given by intelligence personnel to
aircrews or other non-intelligence AFSC personnel.
Initial Qualification Training (IQT)—Initial training necessary to qualify intelligence
personnel in a basic intelligence position without regard to a unit’s specific mission. IQT for
intelligence personnel begins after initial skills training is completed (i.e. the AFSC-awarding
courses) and typically consists of a formal course IFTU. In the event IFTU training is not
available, IQT will be conducted in-house by the assigned unit with MAJCOM approval.
Intelligence Evaluator (IE)—Current and qualified (CMR or BMC) intelligence personnel who
have completed the IE specialized training. Only IEs may conduct intelligence qualification
(mission or specialized) evaluations (initial or periodic).
AFI14-2B-2V1 30 January 2012                                                                   31


Intelligence Evaluator (IE) Evaluation—An evaluation that qualifies the individual as an
intelligence evaluator. Includes evaluations that initially qualify and requalify an intelligence
member as an intelligence evaluator (i.e., INIT IE and RQ IE) as directed in this volume. The
designator for the intelligence evaluator evaluation is “IE” as used with the AF Form 4349 and
AF Form 4350.
Intelligence Qualification Trainer—Intelligence personnel designated by the SIO to conduct
qualification training for other intelligence personnel. Intelligence Qualification Trainers must
meet requirements as outlined in AFI 14-202 Volume 1, paragraph 2.
Internal Intelligence Training Program—The internal intelligence training program is a unit-
developed and maintained program. It is intended to facilitate personnel maintaining their
qualifications and currencies. This volume provides a basic starting point for B-2 intelligence
units and may be modified by the SIO based on the unit’s requirements.
Intelligence Personnel Training Program Manager—The Intelligence Training Program
Manager is appointed by the SIO to oversee the execution of the Internal Intelligence Training
Programs.
Mission Qualification Evaluation (MSN)—An evaluation that qualifies an individual as CMR
or BMC. Includes evaluations that initially qualify and requalify an intelligence member (i.e.,
INIT MSN, ReQual (RQ) MSN). The mission qualification evaluation is administered to ensure
the individual’s ability to support full mission planning and employment in accomplishing the
unit’s operational mission. The designator for the mission qualification evaluation is “MSN” as
used with the AF Form 4349 and AF Form 4350.
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)—Training needed to qualify intelligence personnel to
perform their specific unit mission in an assigned position. This training is a prerequisite for
CMR or BMC status.
Proficiency—The quality of having competence and a command of the fundamentals derived
from practice and familiarity. A measure of how well a task is completed. An individual is
considered proficient when he/she can perform tasks at the minimum acceptable levels of speed,
accuracy, and safety.
Qualification Evaluation (QUAL)—The qualification evaluation is administered to ensure
basic qualification in support to the (BQ) of the examinee. The QUAL is administered to ensure
basic qualification in support to the MDS and duty position of the intelligence professional. The
designator for the qualification evaluation is “QUAL” as used with the AF Form 4349 and AF
Form 4350.
Ready Intelligence Program (RIP)—Task requirements that apply to CMR and BMC
intelligence personnel. The RIP outlines minimum CT requirements and is designed to focus
training on capabilities needed to accomplish the unit’s core tasked missions. RIP establishes the
minimum number of task requirements per training cycle for CMR and BMC qualified
personnel.
Senior Intelligence Officer (SIO)—The SIO is the highest-ranking Air Force officer holding
the 14N3 or 14N4 AFSC or Series 0132 Civilian serving in an Air Force intelligence position.
The SIO's authority extends to all directly subordinate intelligence units. Installations with
intelligence activities in different chains of command will have separate SIOs. In this capacity,
 32                                                            AFI14-2B-2V1 30 January 2012


the SIO provides senior guidance on all policy development, interpretation, and application.
Further, the SIO serves as the chief advisor and mentor for AF intelligence officers, enlisted and
civilians (as appropriate) in terms of career development and progression.
Specialized Qualification Evaluation—An evaluation that qualifies a trainee in a specialized
area. Includes evaluations that initially qualify and requalify an intelligence member for a
particular skill or duty position. Specific types of specialized qualification evaluations will be
identified in the applicable MDS AFI 14-2, Volume 1.
Specialized Training—Training in any skills necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned missions
but is not required for every intelligence specialist. Specialized training is accomplished after
MQT and after the member has attained CMR or BMC status, and is in addition to CMR or
BMC requirements.
Tier 2 (T-2)—Non-compliance has the potential to create moderate risk of mission or program
degradation or failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse. Waivers
may be granted at the MAJCOM/CC level, but may not be delegated lower than MAJCOM
Director.
Tier 3 (T-3)—Non-compliance has a relatively remote potential to create risk of mission or
program degradation or failure, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable fraud, waste or abuse.
Waivers may be granted at the Wing/DRU/FOA commander level.

A4.1. Gradesheets. The AF Form 4381, Intelligence Gradesheet, will be used by Intelligence
Qualification Trainers to record completion of Initial Qualification Training (IQT), Mission
Qualification Training (MQT) and Specialized Training events. Gradesheets will be filed in the
trainee’s qualification training record. Intelligence Evaluators will use the gradesheets to assist
in the completion of the AF Form 4350. After the AF Form 4350 is complete, the used
gradesheets are no longer required to be maintained and may be destroyed by the IE. (T-2)
A4.2. Required Task Elements. The following tables in this attachment include the minimum
task elements to be graded during each MQT event. As a minimum, each numbered element
(i.e., “1. B-2 Systems”) will receive a grade of 1-3. Grades will be considered in aggregate to
determine the overall grade for the event. Sub-elements are listed to provide additional detail as
necessary. For the B-2 Intelligence Academics Gradesheet all knowledge events are represented
on this one gradesheet. The trainer will use a separate gradesheet when grading each knowledge
event. Therefore, the trainee will have, at a minimum, a B-2 Intelligence Academics Gradesheet
on file for each event: B-2 Weapons Systems Academics; Intelligence Support to the Nuclear
Mission; AOR Threat Training; Personnel Recovery; Intelligence Integration in Force
Protection; Research, Analysis and Dissemination (RAD); Intelligence Preparation of the
Operational Environment (IPOE). (T-2)
