      1.1.1.2. Field Elevation: 1197ft Mean Sea Level (MSL).
      1.1.1.3. Runway: Single runway 05/23 with dimensions 10,007ft x 148ft. The runway
      surface is asphalt; it is not a porous friction surface. The first 986ft of RWY 23 and first
      493ft of RWY 05 are grooved concrete. The runway has a down slope of .7 percent
      northeast to southwest. The runway has 26ft wide asphalt shoulders.
      1.1.1.4. Overruns: RWY 05 overrun is 988ft x 148ft and RWY 23 overrun is 986ft x
      148ft. Half of the RWY 05 and RWY 23 under runs are composed of concrete with a
      black epoxy coating and the other half asphalt. No landings/departures are authorized on
      any portion of the under runs/overruns. Note: A near-field Instrument Landing System
      (ILS) monitor is located 659ft into the 23 overrun on centerline and is 4.5ft tall.
   1.1.2. Taxiways (Attachment 3).
      1.1.2.1. The airfield has eight taxiways: Taxiways (TWY) Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta,
      Echo, Foxtrot, Golf and Papa. All taxiways west of TWY Papa are considered taxi tracks
      for airfield criteria.
      1.1.2.2. Airfield Surface: All taxiways are asphalt except TWY A (from TWY P to the
      runway), F, G, C from TWY P to the Alpha Taxi track and TWY A and E east of the
      runway.
      1.1.2.3. Widths: All taxiways east of the runway are 75ft wide. TWY A between the
      runway and TWY P is marked as 80ft wide. Taxi Track A is 39ft wide. TWY B is 75,
      TWY C west of the runway is 73ft, TWY D west of the runway is 75ft wide, TWY E
      west of the runway is 50ft wide, TWY F is 39ft wide and TWY P is 74ft wide. Taxiways
      west of the runway are not equipped with paved shoulders.
   1.1.3. Restrictions:
      1.1.3.1. Precision approach critical areas cover parts of TWY A, B, C, D, E, F, G, P, a
      portion of the runway and Ramp 5 (see Precision Approach Critical Areas depicted in
      Attachment 4).
      1.1.3.2. Aircraft with a wingspan smaller than 125ft, to include helicopters, may taxi
      across TWY A between ramps 3 and 4.
      1.1.3.3. Aircraft with wingspans of 125ft and larger aircraft must use TWYs on the east
      side of the runway and park on Ramp 5/6.

        1.1.3.4. TWY F is for 52d Fighter Wing (52 FW) F-16 aircraft use only and will not be
        used on a regular basis. Prior coordination with Airfield Management is required to
        prepare the taxiway for F-16 operations. When not in use, the 52 FW Commander (52
        FW/CC) has waived Foreign Object Debris (FOD) checks at the access road crossing
        TWY F.
        1.1.3.5. A-10s are not allowed north of Ramp 4 on Alpha Taxitrack without wing
        walkers due to obstructions.
        1.1.3.6. Maintenance must notify Airfield Management (OSAM) when RADAR
        Warning Receiver (RWR) pits are in use. Specify location and duration of use. All
        equipment must be removed upon completion of RWR operations. If equipment violates
        wing-tip clearance criteria for the location, wing-walkers will be used.
1.2. Runway Selection Procedures.
     1.2.1. Runway Selection: When the winds are 5 knots or more, the tower WS shall determine
     the runway in use based on the current and forecasted winds (within a two hour window).
     During wing flying the Supervisor of Flying (SOF) may, after coordination with the Tower
     watch supervisor (WS), determine the runway in use based on higher mission requirements.
        1.2.1.1. Calm Wind Runway: RWY 23 is designated the primary runway for use when
        sustained wind velocity is or forecast to be 5 knots or less.
        1.2.1.2. Runway Change Procedures: Tower will coordinate runway changes with
        Langen Area Control Center (ACC), Ground Control Approach (GCA), SOF, AM Ops,
        Barrier Maintenance (BM) as required, Weather and Fire Department. Tower will notify
        Langen ACC, GCA, SOF, AM Ops, Weather and CEF when the runway change is
        complete and new barrier configuration, as required.
     1.2.2. See Noise Abatement procedures section for additional runway selection criteria.
1.3. Controlled Movement Area (CMA).
     1.3.1. Parameters: The CMA boundary is defined by the instrument, visual flight rule (VFR)
     and non-movement area hold lines surrounding the runway environment (Attachment 3). It
     consists of a large semi rectangular area surrounding the runway. West of the runway, the
     area spans from approximately 100ft west of TWY P. East of the runway, the area is defined
     by the CAT II instrument hold line adjacent to the northeast corner of Ramp 5 and the
     runway hold lines at TWY A, B and C. To the north and south, the CMA extends 100ft
     beyond each overrun.
     1.3.2. Procedures: Only those having official business on the CMA will be approved access.
     Detailed instructions for gaining access to and exiting the CMA are outlined in the
     Spangdahlem Air Base Instruction (SPANGDAHLEMABI) 13-203, Airfield Driver
     Familiarization Program. Crossing the runway for convenience is strictly prohibited. Use
     of perimeter road is the recommended route for getting to the opposite side of the airfield.
     1.3.3. Requirements: General responsibilities, airfield driving requirements, authorization of
     Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) passes, vehicle call signs and traffic procedures are outlined
     in SPANGDAHLEMABI 13-203.
SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                          9


   1.3.4. Incursions: Tower will immediately notify AM Ops of any CMA and/or runway
   intrusions. Airfield Management will immediately respond and escort the individual to AM Ops.
   Penalties for a CMA/runway intrusion are contained within SPANGDAHLEMABI 13-203.
   1.3.5. Control: When the airfield is open the Tower has control of the CMA. Tower
   transfers CMA vehicle access responsibilities to the Command Post (CP) when the Tower is
   closed. Tower will advise the CP of any vehicles or personnel remaining on the CMA as part
   of Tower closing checklist. The CP will maintain accountability of all vehicles and
   personnel they approve on the CMA. When Tower opens, the CP will advise Tower of all
   vehicles and personnel approved on the CMA before Tower will assume CMA responsibility.
   During snow removal operations Tower will retain control of the CMA, however, Tower
   may allow lead snow control vehicle to maintain control and accountability of all snow
   removal vehicles/personnel on the CMA and Runway. Detailed procedures are outlined in a
   Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between Tower and CP. Note: 52 FW/CP does not
   have visibility of the flightline areas and is extremely limited to ensuring total control of
   flightline. CP is entirely reliant on outside user communication.
1.4. Airfield Lighting Systems.
   1.4.1. High Intensity Approach Lights: Approach lighting systems are depicted in the
   Department of Defense FLIP, Flight Information Handbook. Standard Approach Lighting w/
   Sequenced Flashing Lights (ALSF)-2 to RWY 23 (2400 feet length) and Standard ALSF-1 to
   RWY 05 (3000 feet length).
   1.4.2. Precision Approach Path Indicators (PAPI): RWY 05/23 PAPI angle is 3.0 degrees
   and is coincidental with ILS.
   1.4.3. Touch Down Zone Lights: RWY 05/23.
   1.4.4. Threshold Lights: RWY 05/23.
   1.4.5. Runway End Lights (red): RWY 05/23.
   1.4.6. High Intensity Runway Lights (HIRL): 200ft spacing. Lights are located 13ft from
   the usable runway surface.
   1.4.7. Runway End Identifier Lights: RWY 05/23.
   1.4.8. Runway Centerline Lighting.
   1.4.9. Rotating Beacon.
1.5. Permanently Closed/Unusable Portions of the Airfield.
   1.5.1. Hardstand adjacent to Protective Aircraft Shelter (PAS) 3070.
   1.5.2. Hardstand adjacent to Bldg 920 (Hush House 2).
   1.5.3. Extended shoulder on Alpha taxi track adjacent to PAS 3086.
1.6. Aircraft Arresting Systems.
   1.6.1. Aircraft Arresting Systems Management and Use.
       1.6.1.1. The office of primary responsibility (OPR) for aircraft arresting systems will be
       the Civil Engineer NCOIC of Electrical Power Production and the Crew Chief, BM. BM
       will ensure certified personnel are on duty whenever wing flying is in progress. BM will
10                                        SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010


     normally be on duty and available during wing flying, however, they may be released
     whenever 52 FW tail hook equipped aircraft are not flying and no other tail hook aircraft
     are projected to arrive. BM will request permission from the SOF or AM Ops when no
     SOF is on duty to be released from standby.
  1.6.2. Inspections: BM will inspect aircraft arresting systems prior to local flying operations and
  notify AM Ops of cable status. Additional checks may be required when notified by AM Ops.
  1.6.3. Type and location: Six cable barrier arresting kits (BAK) are available on the runway:
  four BAK-12 cables and two MB 100.10C (textile brake) systems (Attachment 3). For
  reporting purposes, cables are numbered from one to six starting at the approach end of
  runway (EOR) 23. When removed, BAK-12 cables have a 20-minute or less response time
  for reconnection during wing flying. All cables are bi-directional, however, cables 1 and 6
  will only be engaged at the departure end. Locations are as follows:
     1.6.3.1. Cable number 1 - Textile Brake - 60ft into the RWY 05 overrun.
     1.6.3.2. Cable number 2 - BAK-12 - 1478ft from RWY 23 app end.
     1.6.3.3. Cable number 3 - BAK-12 - 2505ft from RWY 23 app end.
     1.6.3.4. Cable number 4 - BAK-12 - 2120ft from RWY 05 app end.
     1.6.3.5. Cable number 5 - BAK-12 - 1090ft from RWY 05 app end.
     1.6.3.6. Cable number 6 - Textile Brake - 60ft into the RWY 23 overrun.
     1.6.3.7. When BM is off the runway in an arresting system shelter, the location of the
     shelter is described by the cable number and west for the west side of the runway or east
     for east side of the runway.
  1.6.4. Normal Cable Configurations for Wing Flying.
     1.6.4.1. Normal Cable Configurations for Wing Flying will be: cables 1, 2, 5, and 6
     configured. Cable configurations may be altered at the discretion of the 52 OG/CC or
     SOF for wing flying. Tower WS can alter barrier configuration as required outside wing
     flying, but may not remove barrier 1/6 except for snow removal operations. Aircraft with
     centerline ECM/travel pods will normally taxi past the approach end barrier prior to
     starting take-off roll.
  1.6.5. Coordination.
     1.6.5.1. The 52 CES/CEF will provide assistance to BM when configuring cables. BM
     will request this assistance through Tower. Only BM and qualified fire protection
     personnel are authorized to pull cables across the runway. Only BM will recertify cable
     systems. If BM personnel are not present during system rewind, a post-arrestment
     inspection (tape inspection) must be performed by BM which requires approximately 1
     hour on the runway. The cable will not be certified for continued use until after the
     inspection.
     1.6.5.2. Any change in cable status, such as runway changes or outages, will be
     coordinated immediately between Tower, AM Ops, SOF as required, CEF and BM.
     During arresting system maintenance and configuration changes on the runway surface,
     runway operations must be suspended (excluding maintenance within the barrier shacks;
SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                           11


     i.e. oil/hydraulic changes, etc). Note: Only AM Ops is authorized to resume runway
     operations.
  1.6.6. Successive Engagement Time Intervals.
     1.6.6.1. BAK-12: The average time interval between an engagement and resuming
     normal operations is 30 minutes (dependent on the aircraft’s condition after engagement).
     Once the aircraft is out of the cable, re-certification can be accomplished in 15 minutes.
     1.6.6.2. Cables 1 and 6 can take up to 4 hours to replace. There is no average time
     interval between engagements.
  1.6.7. Slack Arresting Cables, Broken Supports, or Broken Tie Downs:
     1.6.7.1. Immediately report slack cables, broken supports or broken tie downs to Tower.
     This condition may require suspension of normal runway operations. Tower will
     coordinate with the SOF, notify AM Ops and advise aircraft accordingly.
     1.6.7.2. When a slack cable is reported, AM Ops will immediately advise BM. BM will
     inform AM Ops and Tower when the cable is reset and of any status affecting its
     continued use.
     1.6.7.3. A cable check is required when a heavy aircraft arrival or departure impacts a
     cable. A cable is impacted when the aircraft makes high-speed contact with the cable.
     No cable inspection is required when a departure rolls over an approach end cable, an
     arrival rolls over the departure end cables or the aircraft is at taxi speed. Additionally, no
     check is required between sequential heavy aircraft operations. After normal duty hours,
     on weekends/holidays and during emergencies, AM Ops will perform the checks and if
     discrepancies are found, notify CEF to call standby BM personnel to respond.
  1.6.8. Systems Engagements.
     1.6.8.1. Emergency Engagements.
         1.6.8.1.1. The aircraft commander shall notify the SOF or Tower as soon as possible
         with intention to make a cable engagement to ensure the cable is operational and
         ready for engagement. Tower will advise agencies of expected cable engagements
         via the primary crash net. AM Ops will notify BM via the ramp net and/or the
         secondary crash net.
         1.6.8.1.2. In-flight Emergency (IFE) aircraft anticipating a barrier engagement are
         normally given landing priority. However, if the nature of the emergency is such that
         landing may be delayed, the SOF may direct the recovery of other aircraft prior to
         recovery of the emergency aircraft.
     1.6.8.2. Scheduled Engagements.
         1.6.8.2.1. Tower will notify the following agencies prior to system engagement:
            1.6.8.2.1.1. Fire Department.
            1.6.8.2.1.2. Barrier Maintenance.
            1.6.8.2.1.3. Airfield Management.

          1.6.8.2.2. ATC will switch aircraft conducting barrier certifications to Channel 5
          prior to engagement for post-engagement coordination with the Fire Department.
          1.6.8.2.3. 52 CES/CEF will request aircraft tail number, engagement speed and
          weight from the pilot and pass this information to BM for re-certification of the
          arresting system.
1.7. Parking Plan/Restrictions.
   1.7.1. Parking locations for ramp 4 and squadron areas will be determined by Transient Alert
   (TA) and Airfield Management on a case-by-case basis. Airfield Management will inform
   Tower of all transient aircraft parking locations. 726 Air Mobility Squadron’s (726 AMS)
   maintenance operations center (MOC) will notify TA of parking locations for all aircraft
   parking on ramp 5 and hot cargo ramp 6.
   1.7.2. Ramp 4 is the primary parking location for transient aircraft with wingspans less than
   125ft. Secondary parking locations are Ramps 1 and 2 with MOC as the scheduling agency
   and AM operations will coordinate with Air Mobility Control Center (AMCC) for use or
   ramp 5 and 6. Flying squadron ops will contact TA daily to determine the availability of
   ramp 4 for lower refueling pit operations.
   1.7.3. Transient aircraft may be parked in the squadron areas after coordination with the 52d
   Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (52 AMXS) when aircraft size and parking space permit.
   Parking plan must be approved by Airfield Management.
   1.7.4. For approval to use Ramp 1/2 for Physical Fitness Testing (PFT) coordinate with 52d
   Maintenance Group and contact AMCC for PFT use of Ramp 5.
1.8. Air Traffic Control Facilities – Operating Hours, Frequencies, Designated Airspace.

   1.8.2. Base assigned aircraft out of hours operations and air traffic control (ATC) facility
   opening/closing procedures.
       1.8.2.1. Operations outside normal operating hours must be approved by the 52 OG/CC.
       To open the airfield outside normal operating hours, CP and squadron operations will
       advise 52 Operations Support Squadron/ Airfield Operations Flight of after-hour support
       requirements at least 24 hours prior to the planned operation to help ensure the airfield is
       open when required. Note: ATC manning and crew rest requirements limit support of
       out-of-hour operations. Individual operations must be approved/ disapproved due to host
       nation noise abatement procedures.
       1.8.2.2. During normal operating hours, the CP, or squadron operations must notify the
       Airfield Operations Flight Commander (AOF/CC) or Airfield Operations Flight
       Operations Officer (AOF/DO) of known out of hours support requirements to ensure the
       airfield is opened for the planned operation. The AOF/CC or DO will notify the Tower,
       GCA, and AM Ops of the out of hours requirements.
       1.8.2.3. Outside normal operating hours for arrivals/departures, the CP must notify the
       AOF/CC or AOF/DO who will in-turn notify Tower, GCA, and AM Ops personnel.
SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                        13


          1.8.2.3.1. 52 OSS/OSA will provide the CP with a key personnel roster of contact
          information as needed. The list will indicate notification priority.
   1.8.3. When the airfield must be opened outside of published operating hours, AM Ops,
   Tower, and GCA shall be opened at least 30 minutes prior to any scheduled aircraft
   operations. The AOF/CC will determine if conditions require the opening of the GCA. If
   requested, AM Ops may open earlier for flight planning, notice to airman (NOTAM)
   assistance and general customer service assistance. Specific procedures for opening and
   closing ATC and Airfield Management Operations (AM Ops) facilities can be found in the
   appropriate facility OIs.
   1.8.4. For departures, AM Ops, Tower, and GCA shall not close until 15 minutes have
   elapsed following the last departure. For arrivals, AM Ops and Tower shall not close until
   the last aircraft has shut down engines; GCA may close after the last aircraft has landed.
   Tower shall advise GCA when the last aircraft has landed and AM Ops when the last aircraft
   shuts down engines.
   1.8.5. Frequencies are addressed at para 1.9 and Spangdahlem AB’s GCA and Class D
   airspace is depicted in Attachment 2.
1.9. Local Frequencies.

       station load automatically. The testing must be done without special adjustment to the
       auxiliary power system. Tests will be coordinated with the GCA and Tower chief
       controllers. Personnel conducting the test must obtain approval from the GCA and
       Tower watch supervisor before transferring power at building 45 and 77.
       1.10.3.2. Since commercial power is considered reliable and has auto-start
       equipment/uninterruptible power supplies, ATCALS are not normally placed on
       generator power prior to the estimated arrival of severe weather. Unusual situations may
       make a transfer to generator power advisable and will be handled on a case-by-case basis.
1.11. Transient Alert. See current Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) supplement for Transient Alert
Services provided. The CP will provide for storage of classified documents/equipment for transient
aircrews. AMCC will provide for storage of classified documents/equipment for AMC aircraft.
1.12. Automated Terminal Information Service (ATIS) Procedures.
   1.12.1. ATIS frequencies are published in the DoD FLIP, Enroute Supplement. Contents of
   the ATIS shall be IAW FAAO JO 7110.65, Besondere Anweisung Militaerischer
   Flugsicherungsdienst (BesANMilFs) 2-100, AFI 13-204v1-3, 52 OSS/OSAT OI 13-1 and
   this instruction. ATIS operating hours coincide with local wing flying.
       1.12.2. Aircraft will advise air traffic control of ATIS code on initial contact.
1.13. Aircraft Special Operations Areas/Ramps – Arm/De-Arm Areas, Engine Run-up
Areas, Drag Chute Jettison Areas, Hot Pit Refueling Areas.
       1.13.1. Arm/De-Arm and Hot Pit Refueling Areas (Attachment 3). SAB has no drag
       chute equipped aircraft. Engine Run-up procedures discussed in section 1.19.
1.14. Aircraft Towing Procedures.
   1.14.1. Aircraft tows do not require either the Tower or airfield to be open.
   1.14.2. All aircraft must be towed to Hush House 2 (bldg 920).
   1.14.3. When able, contact the Tower via landline when towing aircraft on Alpha taxi track.
   This communication allows de-confliction with taxiing aircraft.
1.15. Aircraft Taxiing Requirements/Routes (to include Heavy Aircraft Jet Thrust
Avoidance Procedures).
   1.15.1. The airfield must be open prior to aircraft taxiing.
   1.15.2. Standard Taxi Routes (Attachment 13)
       1.15.2.1. Unless otherwise advised, pilots will follow these designated taxi flows.
       Instruct aircraft to taxi via the applicable taxi flow. Phraseology:
       “(Callsign) TAXI TO RUNWAY 05 VIA THE A10 TAXI FLOW.”
       1.15.2.2. In cases where there are multiple options, Tower will specify the flow and
       which intersection the aircraft should utilize. This will give the specified taxi route to the
       perpendicular access taxi way and then on to destination. Phraseology:
       “(Callsign) TAXI TO RUNWAY 05 VIA THE F16 TAXI FLOW, UTILIZE CHARLIE.”
       “(Callsign) TAXI TO PARK VIA THE A10 TAXI FLOW, UTILIZE ALPHA.”
SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                           15


   1.15.3. Aircraft taxiing to Hush House 920 is prohibited.
   1.15.4. Large/heavy cargo aircraft must use minimum power setting during taxi operations,
   inboard engines only.
   1.15.5. All aircraft should make 180-degree turns on concrete portions of the runway only.
   1.15.6. The concrete half of the overrun turn-around adjoins the runway, is stressed and is
   used for daylight taxiing only.
   1.15.7. Aircrew that change aircraft and/or HAS must transmit the new HAS number
   (parking location) to the Tower.
1.16. Airfield Maintenance – Sweeper Operations, Grass Mowing, etc.
   1.16.1. Escorts and supervisors of grass cutting operations on or near the runway and
   taxiways will coordinate with AM Ops on their location and work schedule prior to
   commencing and ensure a sweeper is present during their operation.
   1.16.2. Sweeper Operations.
      1.16.2.1. The 52 CES Pavements and Grounds section (CEOHP) will:
          1.16.2.1.1. Ensure one sweeper is dedicated to the airfield during 52 FW flying
          operations and begins operations at least 1 hour prior to operations. A second
          sweeper will be made available during 52 FW operations if conditions or requests
          exceed the airfield sweeper capabilities. Requests for additional sweeper support by
          the Control Tower, AM Ops or the airfield sweeper operator will have a 20-30 minute
          response time. Due to low manning, the Pavements and Grounds section will support
          additional sweeper requests from AM Ops to ensure flight safety and mission
          integrity.
          1.16.2.1.2. See Airfield Management/52 CES Sweeper Ops Letter of Agreement
          (LOA) for more detailed operation information.
1.17. Runway Surface Condition (RSC) and/or Runway Condition Reading (RCR) Values.
   1.17.1. The RCR and RSC, as applicable, will be determined and recorded IAW Technical
   Order (T.O.) 33-1-23, Procedures for use of Decelerometer to Measure Runway Slickness,
   AFI 13-204v3, as supplemented and by established local procedures. Note: RCR can only be
   determined for the RWY, TWY P and TWY G.
   1.17.2. Applicable checks will be completed upon opening the airfield and again when it
   appears that the RSC has changed from what was previously determined or when conditions
   require a RCR check. Revised data will be disseminated to aircrews and other operational
   agencies as significant changes occur. RCRs will be conducted hourly during rapidly
   changing weather conditions and when a potential for freezing conditions exists.
   1.17.3. RCRs can only be conducted when the current surface condition is either snow or ice
   on the runway. If the current RSC is either wet, dry or slush, only the RSC will be reported.
   Note: At the end of wing flying, the reported RCR for that day will revert back to ―not
   reported‖ so as to prevent an outdated RCR being passed.
   1.17.4. If there is no RCR reported the current RSC will be disseminated to:

      of one airfield inspection per day.
   1.18.2. Airfield Checks.
      1.18.2.1. Opening the runway: AM Ops opening airfield checks, at a minimum, must
      determine: the primary take-off, landing and taxi surfaces are FOD free; the current bird
      condition; the runway surface condition; and a visual check of the aircraft arresting
      system configuration.
      1.18.2.2. Additional checks will be conducted:
          1.18.2.2.1. When requested by the SOF or Tower.
          1.18.2.2.2. After C-5, B-747 or AN-124 aircraft land or depart, but is not required
          between sequential C5/B747/AN-124 operations. Note:, Tower will notify AM Ops
          when C-5, B-747 or AN-124 aircraft are 15 miles from landing or as soon as possible.
          When runway operations are suspended for C-5, B-747 or AN-124 landings or
          departures operations will be resumed by Airfield Management.
          1.18.2.2.3. After IFEs, except those involving emergency fuel and physiological
          conditions. Note: Unless a runway check has been specifically waived by the SOF,
          runway operations will be suspended after all IFEs until resumed by Airfield
          Management.
          1.18.2.2.4. After a barrier change or maintenance on the runway surface has been
          accomplished.
SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                        17


          1.18.2.2.5. Nighttime/evening for airfield lighting serviceability checks. If airfield
          lighting is not activated and airfield operating hours have been reduced and/or do not
          extend into periods of darkness a lighting serviceability check is not required.
          1.18.2.2.6. As required by Airfield Management.
1.19. Engine Test/Run-up Procedures.
   1.19.1. MOC and 726 AMS/MOC will provide Tower with aircraft tail number and location
   for all engine runs. Maintainers will contact Spangdahlem Ground Control before start and
   at termination of engine runs. When the Tower is closed, MOC and 726 AMS/MOC will
   coordinate engine runs with 52 FW/CP. Idle engine runs may be accomplished on
   hardstands or ramps. Maximum power engine runs will be accomplished in a hush house for
   52 FW aircraft and in front of the noise barrier on Ramp 5 for AMC aircraft. 52 MXG/CC
   approval is required for all 52 FW deviations. 726 AMS/DO approval is required for 726
   AMS engine runs prior to requesting approval from 52 FW as directed by Figure 1.1. Note:
   Aircraft must be towed to/from the hush houses.
   1.19.2. 726 AMS Aircraft Maintenance Operations Ramps 5 & 6.
      1.19.2.1. Engine Run(s): 726 AMS/MOC will coordinate and track all engine runs on
      Ramps 5 and 6. Run supervisors will contact Spangdahlem Ground prior to start and at
      termination of engine run(s).
      1.19.2.2. 726 AMS/MOC will coordinate and receive authorization for all runs outside of
      the Air Traffic Act Permit (ATAP) Operating Hours window identified in the following
      chart:

Figure 1.1. Engine Run Approval Chart
   1.19.3. Engine Run Supervisor Responsibilities:
      1.19.3.1. Thoroughly review aircraft forms prior to any engine run.
      1.19.3.2. Notify the Production Superintendent/Expediter who will notify the 726
      AMS/MOC prior to and upon completion of all engine runs to include estimated run
      time, tail number, parking spot, name and employee number of the run supervisor,
      number of engines to run, power or idle and engine shutdown time.
   1.19.4. Ramp 5 & 6 Run Location.
      1.19.4.1. C-5 & C-17: Idle runs may be accomplished on all designated parking spots on
      both ramps 5 & 6.
      1.19.4.2. C-5: When throttles are to exceed the ―ground idle‖ range the primary run
      location is the engine run spot on Ramp 5; all exceptions will be approved IAW 1.19.1.
      1.19.4.3. C-17: When throttles are to exceed the ground idle range, and the T.O. allows
      engine operation in reverse, Ramp 5 may be used with 726 AMS Operations Officer for
      Maintenance approval. Extended power runs will be accomplished on the engine run spot
      on Ramp 5.
      1.19.4.4. EXCEPTIONS: In cases when the designated run spots on ramp 5 will not
      suffice (i.e. high winds, improper wind direction), aircraft parking and positioning may
 18                                      SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010


      be used outside the above guidance as long as minimum safe distances are maintained
      and the 726 AMS Operation Officer for Maintenance approves. The 52 OG/CC is the
      approval authority for high-power and reverse thrust engine runs on ramp 6. This option
      is only reserved for when the primary parking spot on ramp 5 is unavailable and the
      engine run is essential for mission accomplishment. Requests for these high powered
      engine runs will be coordinated in the same manner as quiet hour waiver requests to the
      52 OG/CC and only conducted within published airfield operating hours. If approved,
      aircraft with HAZ cargo cannot be on Ramp 6. Also, the jet blast must face toward the
      south. This non-standard parking configuration for engine runs requests will be kept to
      the absolute minimum.
      1.19.4.5. All aircraft not otherwise identified above can run in idle on ramp 5 & 6
      parking spots.
1.20. Noise Abatement Procedures
   1.20.1. To minimize disturbance to the public caused by aircraft conducting ground and
   flight operations noise abatement policies have been established and are outlined in the
   Enroute Supplement and FLIP, Area Planning (AP) 2, General Planning/Route and Area
   Restriction Section.
   1.20.2. Deviations from published noise abatement procedures must be approved by the 52
   OG/CC through the SOF during wing flying. The SOF (if applicable) will notify AM Ops
   and Tower of all approved deviations. AMC will obtain approval from 52 OG/CC through
   the 52 OSS/OSA flight commander for each operation outside published facility hours.
   1.20.3. Transient aircraft are subject to the published noise abatement and engine run
   procedures.
      1.20.4. Noise Complaints: Direct noise complaints to the Community Relations
      Advisory (CRA). The CRA will gather information and investigate complaints as
      required.
   1.20.5. Approach Restrictions (Noise Abatement). Note: The 52 OG/CC is the waiver
   authority for noise abatement policies and may approve deviations for mission
   accomplishment. Operations before/after normal operating hours must be approved by the
   52 OG/CC with the exception of paragraph 1.20.10 below.
   1.20.6. Quiet hours:
      1.20.6.1. On weekends, German holidays, and between 2200L-0800L on weekdays, only
      straight in, full stop landings are authorized (unless waived by the 52 OG/CC).
   1.20.7. RWY 23: Aircraft should not overfly Spangdahlem village. When traffic permits,
   the Tower should avoid breaking four-ship flights at departure end. Fuel and traffic
   conditions permitting, one to three-ship formations that break departure end will avoid
   Beilingen village by following noise abatement procedures or request re-entry for the entire
   formation.
   1.20.8. Closed Pattern: Aircraft will initiate the closed pattern no earlier than departure end
   unless instructed otherwise. On RWY 23, if a closed pattern is delayed until past the
   departure end, aircraft will initially turn left to 200 degrees at the departure end to avoid
   Beilingen.
SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                             19


      1.20.8.1. Controller instructions to extend upwind/downwind or break departure end do
      not alleviate pilot requirements to not overfly local villages.
   1.20.9. Headquarters United States Air Force Europe/A3 (BesANMilF) has granted a
   standing Quiet Hour Waiver for specified Distinguished Visitors (DV) flights at all USAFE
   installations effective 6 January 2005. Commander, United States Air Force in Europe
   (COMUSAFE) directs flights by Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), Deputy
   Commander United States European Command (DCDR USEUCOM), Component
   Commanders, Numbered Air Force Commanders, USAFE/CV and Deputy Commander Air
   Headquarters Ramstein (DCOM) to be granted standing waiver authority for operations
   during NAF, Wing or lower echelon organization quiet hours at all USAFE installations.
   1.20.10. Quiet hours for ceremonies require 52 OG/CC approval. Requests will be
   submitted to 52 OSS/Current Operations (OSO) who will coordinate approval. Once
   approved, 52 OSS/OSO will notify 52 OSS/OSA to process appropriate NOTAMs.
1.21. Protecting Precision Approach Critical Areas (Attachment 4).
   1.21.1. Due to possible localizer and glide slope signal interference, SAB applies
   International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) ILS Critical Area criteria IAW
   BesAnMilFS 2-100. CAT I ILS critical area protection standards will be used for 52 FW F-
   16 and A-10 aircraft only, as per a waiver from the Bundeswehr Air Traffic Services Office
   (AFSBw), when a CAT I ILS approach is in progress. Per the waiver (Attachment 10), no
   more than eight aircraft (A-10 and/or F-16 only) may be allowed in the runway 23 glide
   slope critical area and no more than five aircraft (A-10 and/or F-16 only) in the runway 05
   glide slope critical area when a CAT I ILS approach is in progress. This waiver does not
   apply to vehicles.
   1.21.2. CAT I Operations
      1.21.2.1. Vehicles may be authorized to operate in the critical areas during CAT I
      conditions. Vehicles and aircraft other than F-16/A-10s must be directed to vacate the
      critical areas upon receipt of a 15 mile inbound notification for an ILS arrival. This does
      not strictly prohibit aircraft and vehicles from entering the critical areas when a CAT I
      ILS approach is in progress, however, controllers shall ensure that all approaching and
      departing aircraft, taxing aircraft or vehicles are clear of the ILS critical areas by the time
      an ILS arrival reaches two mile final. If the critical area is NOT clear prior to the arriving
      aircraft reaching two mile final, Tower will notify GCA or aircraft of the unprotected
      critical area. The pilot will be advised via the following phraseology: ―ILS CRITICAL
      AREA NOT PROTECTED, ILS NOT AUTHORIZED, IF RUNWAY OR
      APPROACH LIGHTS NOT IN SIGHT, EXECUTE (missed approach or local
      climbout)‖.
   1.21.3. Cat II Operations (Ceiling less than 200’ and or visibility/RVR less than 800m).
      1.21.3.1. No aircraft or vehicle may be in any critical area when an ILS approach is in
      progress.
      1.21.3.2. When the critical area stop bars are unserviceable, the Tower will direct AM
      Ops to visually confirm the critical areas are free of aircraft/vehicles prior to ILS
      approaches being flown.
 20                                      SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010


       1.21.3.3. GCA watch supervisor shall notify the Tower watch supervisor upon receipt of
       inbound notification from Langen to provide Tower sufficient time to clear any
       aircraft/vehicles out of the critical areas. Note: During CAT II operations, GCA will not
       allow an aircraft to proceed on an ILS approach until the Tower has verified the critical
       areas are free of aircraft/vehicles.
   1.21.4. Preparation for Cat I/II Operations. Due to host nation ILS procedures, preparation
   for ILS operations is critical to operations continuity. Tower must ensure the following steps
   are taken when the weather is/decreases below VFR minima and ILS recoveries are
   anticipated. Note: Refer to BesAnMilFS 2-100 for ILS CAT system down grading
   requirements and other specific criteria not listed below.
       1.21.4.1. In preparation for ILS approaches under Cat I or II the Tower watch supervisor
       will ensure the following equipment is operating normally:
          1.21.4.1.1. All airfield lighting to include their backup power systems.
          1.21.4.1.2. Wind measuring equipment.
          1.21.4.1.3. RVR measuring equipment (transmissiometer).
       1.21.4.2. Tower shall notify the GCA Watch Supervisor immediately of any outages
       with the above systems during preparation for or during ILS operations and initiate the
       appropriate fix action.
1.22. Restricted/Classified Areas on the Airfield.
   1.22.1. Ramps 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are all restricted areas when aircraft are present and use of
   line badges and Entry Control Points (ECP’s) is mandatory. F-16 and A-10 tree areas and
   associated maintenance facilities are restricted areas.
   1.22.2. Control of Movement Area Gates:
       1.22.2.1. 52d Security Forces Squadron (52 SFS) is responsible for opening/closing
       movement area gates and arm/de-arm pad access road gates. The gates will be opened at
       least 2 hours prior to the start of local flying. 52 SFS will notify AM Ops when all gates
       have been opened. Gates on east side of runway will be kept closed at all times. Note:
       TWY F gate shall remain closed unless AM Ops specifically requests it to be opened.
       1.22.2.2. MOC will coordinate with Airfield Management and Security Control Center
       (SCC) to have movement area gates opened for aircraft operations and advise SCC when
       flying is terminated or when the use of the gates are no longer needed.
   1.22.3. Restricted Area procedures are outlined in SPANGDAHLEMABI 31-101,
   Installation Security Instruction (ISI).
SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                     21


1.23. Procedures for Closing/Suspending and Opening Runway Operations.
   1.23.1. Airfield Management personnel have the authority to impose airfield restrictions
   (close/suspend and resume airfield, runway, or taxiway operations) when any unsafe
   condition affects operations (e.g. FOD, bird conditions, snow removal, arresting system
   maintenance/configuration, airfield construction, pavement repair, etc.).
   1.23.2. AM Ops may close or suspend runway operations as necessary. Airfield
   Management is the only agency authorized to reopen or resume operations to a previously
   closed or suspended runway.
   1.23.3. When runway operations are closed or suspended, the airfield manager or designated
   representative will:
      1.23.3.1. Notify Tower, SOF and the CP, as soon as possible, of the estimated length of
      time that the runway will be unusable and any subsequent changes to the estimated time.
      1.23.3.2. When required, transmit a NOTAM for runway closure or reopening.
      1.23.3.3. Notify Tower, SOF and the CP when the runway is reopened or runway
      operations are resumed.
   1.23.4. Tower may also suspend runway operations when required in response to a hazard.
   Tower will notify AM Ops and GCA when it suspends runway operations.
1.24. Procedures for Opening and Closing the Runway. See 1.23. Procedures for
Closing/Suspending and Opening Runway Operations.

                                     FLYING AREAS

2.1. Local Flying Area/Designation of Airspace (Attachment 2).
   2.1.1. The 52 FW local flying area is established as that portion of the Federal Republic of
   Germany within a 300 nautical mile (NM) radius of SAB and north of 48-degree latitude.
   Within this area, there are several reserved, restricted or special use areas with which
   aircrews should be familiar. Exact boundaries of German special use areas are found in the
   DoD FLIP AP guide AP/2, German military aeronautical information publication, In Flight
   Guide (IFG) and 52 OG OI 11-2A/OA-10V3/11-2F-16V3 A-10/F-16
   2.1.2. Terminal instrument approach and departure service is provided to Spangdahlem by
   Langen ACC.
   2.1.3. Spangdahlem GCA Airspace (Attachment 2).
      2.1.3.1. Langen ACC has assigned the GCA airspace approximately 21 NM northeast
      along the RWY 23 extended centerline, 12 NM southwest along the RWY 05 extended
      centerline, 2 NM southeast along the border of the Spangdahlem Control Zone and 12
      NM northwest of Spangdahlem, from the lower level of controlled airspace up to and
      including 5,000ft MSL. In special airspace SA-2, 7,000ft MSL is available upon request
      with Langen ACC.
      2.1.3.2. Due to airspace constraints, the GCA is normally restricted to no more than six
      flights or individual aircraft under GCA control at one time. Controllers will discontinue
      practice IFR approaches at Spangdahlem when the traffic pattern becomes saturated.
      Aircraft will then either full stop, cancel IFR service and proceed under VFR or request
      climb out to return to Langen ACC for continued service.
   2.1.4. Spangdahlem Class D Airspace (Attachment 2).
      2.1.4.1. The Class D airspace is 4 miles each side of the runway centerline, 6 miles
      northeast and 7 miles southwest, along the extended runway centerline, extending from
      the surface up to and including 3,700ft MSL. Exclude the area located to the southwest,
      approximately 2 NM by 3 NM, around the Bitburg airport (from the Spangdahlem

                                           Chapter 3

                                     VFR PROCEDURES

3.1. VFR Weather Minimums.
   3.1.1. VFR conditions are defined as 1500 ceiling and 5 km visibility. Minimum ceiling,
   visibility and altitude requirements for VFR patterns are 2000ft AGL ceiling and 5 KM
   visibility for overheads and 1500ft AGL ceiling and 5km visibility for straight-ins. Note:
   Tower shall not approve requests to perform pattern checks when the official weather
   reported is below established minima for the operation. Aircraft operating VFR outside the
   local identifier for Spangdahlem (ETAD) Class Delta surface area may maneuver over the
   field to examine weather conditions and provide pilot report (PIREP) information.
   Controllers shall not use PIREPs to permit operations.
3.2. VFR Traffic Patterns (Attachments 8 and 9).
   3.2.1. VFR Pattern Hours: Monday through Friday, VFR patterns may be used by non-base
   assigned aircraft 0800-2000L and/or during the wing fly window. The AOF/CC may approve
   use outside these times.
   3.2.2. VFR Entry Procedures: Aircraft will call Tower a minimum of 10 miles prior to the
   VFR entry point. Report shall include callsign, ATIS code, number in flight, position,
   approach request and type of landing. All aircraft will enter by point Alpha, Bravo or Lake
   at 2700ft MSL for the overhead pattern and 2200ft MSL for straight-ins unless otherwise
   instructed by ATC. Aircraft will report Alpha/Bravo/Lake and fly heading 280 degrees/355
   degrees/165 degrees, respectively, for a 3 to 5 mile initial/final. Caution: During the
   summer, glider traffic over the Mosel is frequently a conflict for aircraft. Aircraft reported
   activity near entry points should be included on ATIS.
   3.2.3. VFR Traffic Patterns:
      3.2.3.1. Direction of turns: left for RWY 23 and right for RWY 05.
      3.2.3.2. Overhead and Fighter Closed: 2700ft MSL.
      3.2.3.3. Light aircraft and helicopter pattern: 1700ft MSL.
      3.2.3.4. DELETED
      3.2.3.5. Short Initial: When continuation of a pattern is not possible due to other traffic
      and a full reentry is not practical, controllers may send aircraft back to short initial. Short
      initial is locally defined as 1-3 mile initial. If needed a greater distance may be specified;
      ex: “Continue downwind, report 5 mile initial.”
          3.2.3.5.1. “(Callsign) CARRY STRAIGHT THROUGH REPORT SHORT INITIAL.”
          Used when aircraft are at initial. Aircraft will fly to departure end, turn crosswind out
          of the traffic pattern (complying with noise abatement) and fly within the confines of
          the normal pattern to short initial.
          3.2.3.5.2. “(Callsign) BREAKOUT, REPORT SHORT INITIAL.”
 24                                      SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010


          Used when an aircraft is established on the downwind (closed, following break,
          etc…). The aircraft will continue on the downwind to the base leg, breakout, comply
          with pattern breakout procedures and report short initial, instead of re-entering via
          Alpha, Bravo or Lake.
          3.2.3.5.3. “(Callsign) PROCEED DIRECT SHORT INITIAL.”
          Used when aircraft are not established on a standard pattern (enroute to a VFR point,
          somewhere at a point in space.)
3.3. Special Procedures.
   3.3.1. Helicopters. The primary helicopter arrival and departure surface is the runway.
   Helicopters may be authorized to arrive or depart from any paved surface in the controlled
   movement area if the runway is unavailable if the following requirements are met; 75ft
   clearance from any other stationary aircraft (including other helicopters), the helicopter does
   not fly over any personnel, aircraft or populated portion of the base and Tower has the
   helicopter in sight.
   3.3.2. Functional Check Flight. Detailed procedures are outlined in the LOA between the 52
   OG and Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH (Langen ACC).
   3.3.3. Parachute Jumping. Detailed procedures are outlined in the LOA between the 52 OG
   and Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH (Langen ACC).
   3.3.4. Tactical Arrivals
      3.3.4.1. The only tactical arrival procedures for Spangdahlem AB are listed in,
      (Attachments 11 and 12), and are only authorized for use by 52 FW assigned aircraft.
3.4. Reduced Same Runway Separation Procedures (RSRS).
   3.4.1. USAFE authorized Reduced Same Runway Separation will be enforced between all

   3.4.3. RSRS shall only be applied:
      3.4.3.1. Between USAF fighter/attack aircraft (F-15, F-16, A-10). Note: Although
      USAFE authorizes RSRS for USAFE C-130 operations, procedures shall not be applied
      locally.
      3.4.3.2. With non-52 FW aircraft when a USAFE/DO approved letter of agreement
      exists between the 52 OG/CC and the non-52 FW/US aircraft unit commander.
      Coordination procedures are outlined in USAFE guidance.
   3.4.4. RSRS is ONLY authorized for:
      3.4.4.1. Full stop behind full stop, low approach or touch-and-go.
      3.4.4.2. Touch-and-go behind touch-and-go or low approach.
      3.4.4.3. Low approach behind low approach or full stop. Note: When first aircraft full
      stops, the succeeding aircraft shall offset laterally so as not to overfly the aircraft on
      runway.
SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                          25


       3.4.4.4. Option or stop-and-go behind a low approach.

4.1. Radar Traffic Patterns (Attachment 8).
   4.1.1. Altitude 5000ft MSL and airspeed 250 KIAS.
   4.1.2. DELETED.
   4.1.3. Aircraft that intend to continue with the Tower after their approach will be switched to
   Tower no later than the final approach fix. GCA will continue to monitor the approach as
   necessary IAW directives.
   4.1.4. Trail Recovery Procedures.
       4.1.4.1. F-16 Radar Trail Recovery Procedures.
          4.1.4.1.1. Flight leads electing to recover using radar trail recovery procedures will
          advise ATC of their intentions and number of aircraft in formation prior to taking
          spacing. Radar trail recoveries may only be flown as a 4-ship or less. By letter of
          agreement with Langen, the last aircraft in trail will squawk 0032 as soon as the flight
          goes trail. The responsibility for separation within the formation rests with the flight
          lead.
          4.1.4.1.2. Aircrews conducting radar in-trail recoveries are responsible for their own
          separation between elements of their flight while on final for full-stop landings. To
          ensure appropriate departure separation, multiple practice radar in-trail approaches
          that do not terminate with a full-stop landing shall be conducted only in VMC.
          During practice approaches in VMC conditions, after an executed low
          approach/landing, the flight is responsible for their own separation until ATC initiates
          flight split-ups for individual control on departure.
       4.1.4.2. A-10 Trail Recovery Procedures (VMC only with local ATC coordination).
          4.1.4.2.1. If at any time spacing is in question, the wingman will use ―see and avoid‖
          and, if necessary, coordinate with the local ATC controller for a separate clearance.
          The responsibility for separation within the formation rests with the flight lead.
       4.1.4.3. ATC breakouts apply only to individual aircraft on Trail Recoveries. Flight
       leads and ATC retain the option to have all members breakout as a flight.
       4.1.4.4. When flying Trail Recovery procedures from WEZEL, expect a minimum of 8
       NM between flights starting the approach.
       4.1.4.5. Lost Communications procedures will be IAW paragraph 7.12.
       4.1.4.6. Missed approach/break-out/go-around procedures will be IAW paragraph 7.15.
4.2. Availability/Restrictions for Surveillance Approaches.
   4.2.1. Use of the airport surveillance radar (ASR) for radar flight following.
       4.2.1.1. The GCA will flight follow 52 FW assigned aircraft on ILS and TACAN
       approaches with the ASR upon pilot request or as deemed necessary by controllers.
SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                          27


   4.2.2. Transfer radio communications to Tower prior to 10 miles unless the pilot has
   requested flight following.
4.3. Local Departure Procedures (Attachments 6 and 7).
   4.3.1. Take-off Position: Controllers should expect ―static‖ take-offs with non-standard
   spacing. More time is required for static take-offs than for rolling take-offs because aircraft
   conduct engine checks when in departure position on the runway.
   4.3.2. IFR departures will be IAW published departure procedures unless otherwise directed
   by ATC. VFR departures will remain on Tower frequency until departing ETAD Delta
   surface area.
       4.3.2.1. Aircraft will state number in flight when requesting take-off clearance from
       Tower.
4.4. Radar Vector to Initial Procedures.
   4.4.1. Both VFR and IFR aircraft can request vectors to initial. For IFR aircraft, IFR
   clearances are automatically cancelled when pilot reports initial.

                              EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

5.1. Operation of the Primary and Secondary Crash Net.
   5.1.1. The 52 CS will maintain suitable emergency communications systems to permit rapid,
   reliable and comprehensive notification of impending or actual airfield emergencies to
   agencies concerned. The communications system will normally consist of the primary and
   secondary crash nets.
      5.1.1.1. Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS): Tower, AM Ops, Spangdahlem flight
      surgeon’s office and Fire Department are on the PCAS and have two-way
      communications. The CP will only monitor the PCAS. The following procedures apply:
          5.1.1.1.1. Tower will test the PCAS daily between 0800L and 0830L Monday-
          Saturday and between 1200L and 1230L Sundays and German holidays. In the event
          a station on the PCAS fails to answer (with the exception of Flight Med on the
          weekends), Tower will call the station by standard telephone. If the office is
          scheduled to be occupied and the crash phone does not ring Tower will notify the
          communication service center.
          5.1.1.1.2. Tower will activate the PCAS for emergencies or impending emergencies
          when:
             5.1.1.1.2.1. An aircraft has crashed, or is suspected to have crashed, on or off
             base.
             5.1.1.1.2.2. Notification of an actual or possible in-flight or ground emergency is
             received.
             5.1.1.1.2.3. A no-radio (NORDO) aircraft is inbound or has landed, unless other
             means of communication indicate an emergency situation does not exist.
             5.1.1.1.2.4. An aircraft intends to or unexpectedly engages an arresting system.
             Note: Do not activate crash phone for scheduled engagements.
             5.1.1.1.2.5. An actual or suspected aircraft hijack or unauthorized movement.
             5.1.1.1.2.6. A defector or non-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) nation
             aircraft is inbound or has landed.
             5.1.1.1.2.7. Suspicious activities (security violations, personnel injuries, etc.) are
             observed/reported on the aerodrome.
             5.1.1.1.2.8. As required by specific situations cited elsewhere in this instruction.
             5.1.1.1.2.9. KRISTOFF/MEDEVAC aircraft are inbound.
             5.1.1.1.2.10. As deemed necessary by Tower watch supervisor.
   5.1.2. Secondary Crash Net (SCN):
      5.1.2.1. AM Ops will test the SCN daily following the PCAS check between 0800L and
      0830L Monday-Saturday and 1200L and 1230L Sundays and German holidays. In the
SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                         29


      event a station on the SCN fails to answer, the AM Ops dispatcher will call the station
      concerned by standard telephone. If the office is scheduled to be occupied and the
      secondary crash phone does not ring, the dispatcher will notify the communication
      service center. AM Ops will perform a weekly check of the backup SCN. Report backup
      SCN malfunctions as stated above. Note: IAW AFI 13-204v3, the SCN will only be
      used to relay information critical to aircraft and airfield operations. Use other forms of
      communication to relay non-critical base information.
      5.1.2.2. AM Ops will activate the secondary crash net and furnish known information to
      the following agencies as appropriate (T=Two-way communication available, R=Receive
      only). Note: All stations with two-way communications shall acknowledge daily checks
      by stating clarity and initials.

          5.1.2.2.15. AMCC (T)
      5.1.2.3. The CP will make all notifications to agencies listed in paragraph 5.1.2.2. when
      AM Ops is closed. Note: These actions take precedence over all other actions. Normal
      activity will continue only after all agencies have been notified.
      5.1.2.4. All stations with two-way capability (T) must use a noise reduction feature.
      Failure to do so will result in the station being deleted or changed to receive only. If an
      agency moves or gets new equipment it is the user’s responsibility to maintain the noise
      reduction feature. Notify AM Ops prior to any moves.
5.2. Emergency Response Procedures - In-Flight/Ground Emergency Procedures (On/Off
Base).
   5.2.1. Designation and Responsibilities of the On-Scene Commander.
 30                                      SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010


      5.2.1.1. The 52 OSS/OSA has specific checklists developed in each facility for in-
      flight/ground emergencies, on or off base, and will follow them to accomplish mission
      critical actions.
   5.2.2. When an off-base crash is reported during normal duty hours to an agency, AM Ops
   will obtain full details including name, address and telephone number of the person making
   the report. This information will be relayed immediately to Tower, who will activate the
   primary crash alarm system and report the mishap information. Note: These actions take
   precedence over all other actions. Normal activity will continue only after all agencies have
   been notified.
   5.2.3. The incident commander will normally be the Senior Fire Official and will be in
   complete control at the scene of all mishaps until such time as relieved by a wing designated
   on-scene commander IAW the Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2,
   Annex A.
   5.2.4. During any on/off-base mishap the Airfield Operations Flight personnel will follow
   procedures listed on the locally produced crash grid map for plotting mishaps. Additionally,
   each facility will execute appropriate facility checklists and OSA OI 13-4 Mishap and
   Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR) Program as required.
5.3. External Stores Jettison Area Procedures.
   5.3.1. Controlled.
      5.3.1.1. The primary impact point is Baumholder Range, target #1.
      5.3.1.2. ATC will, as required, coordinate for transfer of emergency aircraft to Langen
      for transit to Baumholder Range.
      5.3.1.3. If fuel state does not permit travel to Baumholder Range or entry into the range
      is not authorized, return to SAB and follow the emergency jettison procedures in Para
      5.3.2.
   5.3.2. Emergency.
      5.3.2.1. If time and conditions permit, fly along Runway 05 and turn to a heading of
      065°, flying 250-275 KIAS at or above frag altitude to 6200’ MSL (5K’ AGL).
      Selectively jettison in the unpopulated area at N4959.2 E00642.9.
      5.3.2.2. If IMC, follow the above procedures using vectors from Spangdahlem GCA (CH
      10), to line up at the release point at N4959.2 E00642.9. Note: Precision control with
      ASR is not possible and the probability of ATC vectors to the release point at the
      prescribed bearing is low. All effort should be made to use aircraft systems to aid
      navigation to the release point. ATC will not call jettison release.
          5.3.2.2.1. GCA will coordinate with Langen for the drop altitude.
      5.3.2.3. Plot mishap data (aircraft, wreckage, personnel, etc.) on crash grid maps
      according to instructions contained on the maps.
SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                         31


5.4. Fuel Dumping.
   5.4.1. Spangdahlem GCA will not control fuel-dumping operations due to limited airspace.
   Spangdahlem GCA will transfer control of aircraft to Langen ACC for fuel dumping
   operations.
5.5. Emergency Arresting/Barrier Gear Procedures.
   5.5.1. Refer to locally developed checklists maintained in AM Ops and the Tower.
5.6. Hot Brake Area and Procedures (Attachment 3).
   5.6.1. When notified of hot brakes, Tower will activate the PCAS, switch the aircraft to CH5
   and if conditions permit, direct aircraft to one of the designated "hot brake" areas that does
   not coincide with de-arming. Crash Recovery will notify Tower if an aircraft must
   discontinue taxi and relay cordon size (normally 300 feet). The Senior Fire Official or
   Incident Commander will direct on-scene activities to mitigate the emergency by
   coordinating with Crash Recovery to determine if the aircraft has actual hot brakes. The
   Senior Fire Official or Incident Commander will continue or terminate the emergency and
   notify Tower.
5.7. Abandonment of Aircraft (Controlled Bail-Out, Ejection, Plotting Aircraft
Coordinates).
   5.7.1. Uncontrolled:
      5.7.1.1. Use pilot judgment and follow T.O. procedures.
   5.7.2. Controlled:
      5.7.2.1. The primary impact point is Baumholder Range.
      5.7.2.2. ATC will, as required, coordinate for transfer of emergency aircraft to Langen
      for transit to Baumholder Range.
      5.7.2.3. If fuel state does not permit travel to Baumholder Range for ejection use the
      emergency bailout procedures in Para 5.7.3
   5.7.3. Emergency.
      5.7.3.1. If time and conditions permit, fly along Runway 05 and turn to a heading of
      065°, flying at slowest practical airspeed above 3200’ MSL (2K’ AGL). Eject at the
      unpopulated area at N4959.2 E00642.9.
      5.7.3.2. If IMC, follow the above procedures using vectors from Spangdahlem GCA (CH
      5), to line up at the ejection point at N4959.2 E00642.9. Note: Precision control with
      ASR is not possible and the probability of ATC vectors to the release point at the
      prescribed bearing is low. All effort should be made to use aircraft systems to aid
      navigation to the release point. ATC will not direct bailout.
          5.7.3.2.1. GCA will coordinate with Langen for the drop altitude.
      5.7.3.3. Plot mishap data (aircraft, wreckage, personnel, etc.) on crash grid maps
      according to instructions contained on the maps.

5.8. Personnel/Crash Locator Beacon Signal/Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT)
response procedures.
   5.8.1. If an operational ground testing of ELTs is conducted, it will be within the first 5
   minutes of the hour and limited to no more than three audio sweeps of the radio beacon. The
   following procedures apply:
   5.8.2. Tower will notify the CP whenever receiving an ELT signal outside of the first five
   minutes of each hour or longer than authorized and again if it stops.
   5.8.3. The CP is responsible for notifying MOC and 726 AMS/MOC when advised of an
   ELT and also notifies the USAFE Search and Rescue as required. MOC will notify TA.
   5.8.4. MOC will advise 726 AMS/MOC and life support to check their equipment for an
   ELT. If the ELT continues and all equipment is normal at life support, MOC will notify
   flight operations to send personnel with direction finding equipment to locate the source of
   the ELT.
5.9. Hung Ordnance Procedures.
   5.9.1. When recovering with hung ordnance, pilots will notify the SOF and Tower. If an
   emergency is declared, the pilot or SOF will notify ATC immediately. The primary unsafe
   gun/hung ordnance area is the de-arm pad for the respective runway. If EOD is required at
   the de-arm area, the pilot must declare an emergency. Aircraft handling procedures are
   further outlined in 52 OG OI 11-2A/OA-10V3/11-2F-16V3 and local maintenance policy.
   5.9.2. If an arriving AMC aircraft declares an IFE with a hung flare, the tower will ring out
   the PCN and state the nature and the pilot’s intentions. AM Ops will ring out the SCN after
   the PCN notification. If ground maintenance finds a hung flare once the aircraft is in
   parking, the AMC MOC will call ATC and declare a GE giving the tower as much
   information as possible (parking spot, required cordon etc). Tower will activate the PCN and
   AM Ops will follow-up with activation of the SCN.
5.10. Wind Limitations on Control Tower.
   5.10.1. Air traffic controllers shall evacuate the control Tower when the wind reaches steady
   75 knots or gusts of 94 knots or more. The following procedures apply:
      5.10.1.1. Tower personnel will evacuate according to OSAT OI 13-1.
      5.10.1.2. AM Ops will initiate NOTAM actions.
   5.10.2. When current wind drops below 75 knots, and is forecast to remain there, Tower
   operations will resume.
5.11. Evacuation of ATC and AM Operations Facilities.
   5.11.1. Tower, GCA and AM Ops personnel shall evacuate their respective facilities
   whenever there is a bomb threat, explosion or when a fire occurs which cannot be
   extinguished and endangers lives. Tower, GCA and AM Ops personnel will evacuate
   according to individual facility procedures and associated checklists.
   5.11.2. After deemed safe by the Senior Fire Official, the decision to resume operation of an
   ATC facility after evacuation or fire, shall be made by the 52 OSS/CC or representative (i.e.
   52 OSS/OSA, chief controller, WS).
SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                          33


5.12. Other Emergency Procedures as Locally Determined Simulated Flameout (SFO),
Precautionary Approaches.
   5.12.1. SFO Procedures (Attachment 9).
      5.12.1.1. Wing assigned F-16s may fly straight-in (SI) and overhead SFOs to RWYs 23
      and 05. Aircraft will squawk 4217 when performing SFO procedures.
      5.12.1.2. Pattern Descriptions:
          5.12.1.2.1. Overhead SFO: Shall always be flown to the southeast of the field
          (opposite control Tower). Maneuvering airspace will normally be flown within 3 NM
          of the runway. Direction of turns shall be left for RWY 23 and right for RWY 05.
          5.12.1.2.2. SI SFO: May commence between 8 and 10 NM along the extended
          runway centerline. Random SFO entries shall not be conducted (i.e. procedure shall
          not start at VFR entry points).
   5.12.2. Minimum Weather Requirements:
      5.12.2.1. High Key Entry: 8000ft ceiling and 5 km visibility.
      5.12.2.2. Low Key Entry: 4000ft ceiling and 5 km visibility.
      5.12.2.3. Ceiling must be at least 1000ft above the highest part of the pattern flown (for
      both SI and overhead) with the pilot being able to maintain VMC throughout the
      approach. In addition, the pilot must maintain visual contact with the runway
      environment throughout the maneuver.
      5.12.2.4. SFOs are only authorized between sunrise and sunset.
      5.12.2.5. SFO airspace must be delegated by Langen ACC/GCA prior to climbing above
      3700ft MSL.
   5.12.3. SFO Entry Altitudes:
      5.12.3.1. High Key or 8-10 NM (SI): FL 082 – FL095.
      5.12.3.2. Low Key or 5 NM (SI): 4,200ft MSL – FL065.
      5.12.3.3. Pilot must notify Tower of entry altitude.
   5.12.4. SFO Low Approach Procedures:
      5.12.4.1. RWY 23/05: Aircraft on the go for an overhead SFO will fly the normal
      overhead pattern ground track until Tower approves a climb to either high key or low key
      altitude. Note: ATC may issue alternate instructions when traffic dictates.
   5.12.5. Pilots will:
      5.12.5.1. Call Tower with current position, SFO request (as soon as possible for
      coordination) and ―High Key‖ or ―Low Key‖.
      5.12.5.2. Ensure that all radio calls are made at the correct points to aid Tower in traffic
      sequencing. SI SFOs require a radio call to Tower indicating entry point call. The
      following radio calls are mandatory: ―10NM straight in SFO‖, ―4 NM, gear down, low
      approach‖; standard ―High Key‖, ―Low Key‖ and ―Base Key‖ calls apply to the overhead
      SFO pattern.
 34                                      SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010


      5.12.5.3. Remain vigilant for traffic in and around the overhead SFO maneuvering area.
      5.12.5.4. When initiating a traffic breakout, if possible, remain at least 1000ft above
      overhead pattern altitude and re-enter at high key or a VFR reporting point.
   5.12.6. Tower will:
      5.12.6.1. Approve or disapprove the SFO (and requested entry point) based on traffic and
      weather conditions, and the LOA with Langen ACC.
      5.12.6.2. Specific SFO procedures may be found in the Langen/52OG LOA.
   5.12.7. Deconflicting SFO and Overhead Traffic
      5.12.7.1. When Tower requires aircraft to offset initial for SFO traffic the following
      phraseology will be used: “(Callsign) OFFSET INITIAL ONE-HALF MILE WEST FOR
      SFO TRAFFIC.”
      5.12.7.2. Tower will give descent instructions and traffic information to aircraft at High
      Key. Note: High Key vs. Initial is a mandatory traffic call to both aircraft/flights
      involved.
“(Callsign) REPORT LOW KEY, TRAFFIC TWO F-16’s FIVE MILE INITIAL OFFSET TO THE
WEST.”
      5.12.7.3. Aircrew are required to have visual recognition of traffic at initial at or before
      Low Key. Controllers will not enforce this requirement, but as workload permits
      continue to update traffic throughout the approach until the pilot reports visual. If the
      pilot does not obtain visual by Low Key, the approach will be discontinued and the
      aircraft will not descend below 3,200’. Expect the aircraft to enter a holding pattern at
      Low Key until alternate instructions are issued. The controller and pilot will have several
      options at this point, but all require vigilance and communication from both parties.
      Recommended actions are, but are not limited to the following:
          5.12.7.3.1. Climb back to High Key.
          5.12.7.3.2. Continue the approach from Low Key.
          5.12.7.3.3. Proceed outbound to a VFR entry point.
          5.12.7.3.4. Other options as traffic conditions permit.
5.13. Alternate ATC Facility Procedures.
   5.13.1. Control Tower:
      5.13.1.1. When ATC service cannot be provided from the primary control Tower due to
      fire or communication failures, controllers will deploy to the old Tower, bldg 47, and
      continue short-term service as practical. The potential exists that any aircraft not already
      under Spangdahlem Tower/GCA control could be required to divert. Tower will make
      every effort to continue service until all 52 FW aircraft have been recovered. Alternate
      Tower facilities are not meant for sustained wing flying support.
      5.13.1.2. The alternate facility falls within the required cordon area for a bomb threat. In
      the event of evacuation for bomb threat, controllers will proceed to Fuels Management.
      ATC services will not be available from the control tower until the threat is resolved.
SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                          35


     5.13.1.3. In the event of high winds, sustained 75 kts or gusting 94 kts or in the opinion
     of the watch supervisor conditions warrant evacuation, controllers will evacuate to the
     GCA or AM Ops. ATC services will not be available from the control tower until the
     winds subside.
     5.13.1.4. GCA will monitor Tower local control Ultra High Frequency/ Visual Flight
     Rules (UHF/VHF) frequencies and provide airport advisory service during the control
     Tower transition.
     5.13.1.5. Prior to control Tower evacuation, Tower personnel will notify all concerned
     agencies via Primary Crash Alarm System (or telephone/cell phone, depending on the
     nature of the evacuation). Tower personnel will notify all concerned agencies when
     operations are resumed in the primary control Tower.
  5.13.2. GCA:
     5.13.2.1. GCA airspace will be returned to Langen ACC when ATC service cannot be
     provided from the GCA. There is no requirement for an alternate facility.
     5.13.2.2. Radar failure: During total ASR failure, the GCA will transfer control of
     pattern aircraft to Langen ACC. Aircraft established on instrument final approach shall
     be transferred to Tower.
        5.13.2.2.1. Tower shall transfer any aircraft that executes a missed approach, go
        around or breakout to Langen ACC and advise GCA.
        5.13.2.2.2. In the event immediate transfer of communications and control of aircraft
        cannot be accomplished, the GCA will establish affected aircraft in a ―Non-Radar
        Transition Holding Area‖ and utilize alternate means to transfer communications and
        control of the aircraft concerned to Langen ACC.
        5.13.2.2.3. The holding area is the missed approach holding point located on
        Spangdahlem (SPA) R350 @ 11 DME.
        5.13.2.2.4. The GCA will send all affected aircraft to this holding area and separate
        aircraft IAW BesAnMilFS 2-100 section 662 using emergency separation of 500 ft
        from A4500 to FL75. The GCA will instruct aircraft to squawk 7700 and contact
        Langen ACC sector EIFEL. Note: A5500 to FL75 will only be used when the GCA
        has the SA 2 airspace delegated to them.
        5.13.2.2.5. During an ASR outage, Langen ACC will only clear aircraft on a
        published approach procedure for full stop landings. Practice approaches are not
        accepted.
     5.13.2.3. The GCA will notify all agencies concerned should the radar fail and upon
     resumption of operations. Advise all aircraft that Spangdahlem GCA’s radar has failed
     and radar contact is lost. Issue a speed restriction to all aircraft to maintain 265 knots or
     less.
     "ATTENTION ALL AIRCRAFT, SPANGDAHLEM RADAR OUT OF SERVICE, RADAR
     CONTACT LOST, MAINTAIN TWO-SIX FIVE KNOTS OR LESS. STAND BY FOR
     NON-RADAR TRANSITION.”
 36                                      SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010


      5.13.2.4. Once aircraft are altitude separated, transition aircraft to the holding fix based
      on last known or reported position.
      (ACFT ID) CLEARED DIRECT ODROV, HOLD NORTHWEST AS PUBLISHED.
      SQUAWK EMERGENCY AND CONTACT LANGEN CENTER THREE-FOUR-ZERO
      POINT THREE-TWO-FIVE OR ONE-TWO-FIVE POINT SIX (or local channel 13, as
      applicable).

      EMERGENCY AND CONTACT LANGEN RADAR ON THREE-FOUR-ZERO POINT
      THREE-TWO-FIVE OR ONE-TWO-FIVE POINT SIX (or local channel 13, as
      applicable).”
   5.13.3. AM Ops:
      5.13.3.1. Evacuation/Alternate facility procedures will be IAW facility quick reaction
      checklist.
5.14. Hydrazine Response.
   5.14.1. Hydrazine response procedures will be initiated anytime the emergency power unit
   (EPU) on an F-16 is activated or there is a known or suspected hydrazine leak.
   5.14.2. Tower will activate the PCAS passing all known information. Note: Anytime an
   emergency F-16 has an activated EPU the phrase, "POSSIBLE HYDRAZINE LEAK" will
   be included in the message.
   5.14.3. Hydrazine locations are the intersections of TWY P and TWYs A,B, D and E.
   Landing aircraft should taxi to the nearest area. An incident aircraft already on the ground is
   not permitted to taxi unless directed by the Senior Fire Official or Incident Commander.
   5.14.4. The Senior Fire Official or Incident Commander will direct that all taxiing aircraft
   keep away from the ground emergency location and establish a 300-foot clear area around
   the emergency aircraft. The Senior Fire Official or Incident Commander will direct
   notification of the hydrazine response teams for proposed assistance as needed.
5.15. Emergency Single Frequency Approach (SFA).
   5.15.1. Spangdahlem’s SFA frequency is local channel 5. Pilots should expect a transfer to
   this designated frequency for both in flight emergencies (IFE) and ground emergencies. The
   GCA, Tower, SOF and Senior Fire Official have capability to broadcast on the frequency.
   The ATC facilities control channel 5 use in the air. After the aircraft has landed, the air
   traffic control facilities will transfer control of channel 5 to the Senior Fire Official.
      5.15.1.1. GCA shall:
          5.15.1.1.1. Monitor channel 5 at all times. Verbally advise Tower when transferring
          control of aircraft communications on the SFA from the GCA to Tower.
          5.15.1.1.2. Assign channel 5 to arriving emergency aircraft for Langen ACC
          inbounds. If more than one emergency arises, standard communication procedures
          apply for the next and subsequent emergencies.
SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                 37

7.21. Airfield Snow Removal Operations.
   7.21.1. Snow       removal    operations   are  conducted    IAW local procedures,
   SPANGDAHLEMABI 32-1003, Snow Removal and Ice Control. Snow removal operations
   on the airfield are conducted by 52 CES snow removal center.
   7.21.2. Snow Removal from ILS Glide slope. Should snow accumulation reach 18 inches
   (less if there is noticeable effect on the glide slope signal), its removal in the ILS far field
   monitor area may become critical to the safe operation of the ILS. The decision to remove
   snow will be made by the 52 OG/CC or designated representative and is based on:
       7.21.2.1. Mission requirements.
       7.21.2.2. Results of local aircraft flying ability checks.
       7.21.2.3. Current and forecasted weather conditions.
   7.21.3. Airfield lighting will be the point of contact for after hours support of the airfield
   lights during snow removal operations. Tower may, at the request of snow control, leave the
   runway edge/centerline lights and taxiway lights on when Tower closes. The request must be
   made prior to the airfield closing.
   7.21.4. Snow berms along taxiways and aprons will not exceed a height of 24 inches.
7.22. Bird/Wildlife Control.
   7.22.1. The airfield is monitored on a daily basis by airfield management, wing flight safety
   and civil engineering to identify potential animal threats and initiate corrective action. The
   Bird Aircraft Strike Hazards (BASH) program is maintained by 52FW/SE and guidelines for
   determining bird conditions are outlined in the SPANGDAHLEMABI 91-212, 52 FW Bird
   Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Plan.
7.23. Bird Watch Conditions (BWC).
   7.23.1. Local BWC are established in SPANGDAHLEMABI 91-219
7.24. SOF Operating from the Tower.
   7.24.1. General. SOFs provide valuable technical assistance to the flying community and
   ATC, serving as the 52 OG/CC representative for flying related issues. The Tower WS
   serves as the expert for ATC related issues. Together, the goal is to jointly assure a safe and
   efficient flow of air traffic.
   7.24.2. Coordination.
       7.24.2.1. In order to provide an organized professional environment, all questions,
       directions and coordination must be accomplished directly between the SOF and Tower
       or GCA WS only.
       7.24.2.2. The Tower WS or senior controller will keep the SOF advised of the current
       status of the runway, barriers, NAVAIDs, air traffic and any other situations that may
       affect wing operations.
       7.24.2.3. PIREPs will be passed between facility WSs and the SOF.
   7.24.3. SOF Position Equipment.
SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                          47


      7.24.3.1. SOF position equipment includes Ground Radio Communication (GRC) -211
      VHF and -171 UHF multi-channel radios, Automated Weather Dissemination System,
      computer and multiple line telephone.
      7.24.3.2. Tower may request use of the SOF multi-channel radio during equipment
      outages. Conversely, the SOF may also request use of Tower multi-channel radio or
      telephones when necessary.
      7.24.3.3. The SOF should relay all equipment outages to the WS, who will initiate repair
      actions.
   7.24.4. Special Conditions and Emergencies.
      7.24.4.1. ATC will notify the SOF of IFE/GE aircraft as soon as conditions permit.
      7.24.4.2. The SOF will notify ATC of any IFE/GE aircraft as soon as possible.
      7.24.4.3. The SOF may relay emergency information to aircraft on ATC frequencies
      through Tower or GCA controllers. ATC will relay messages provided by the SOF
      verbatim and preface transmissions with, "SOF advises/directs.‖ If necessary, the SOF
      may, after the approval of the WS, communicate directly with the aircraft involved on the
      ATC frequency. When this occurs, advisory instructions must be limited to that essential
      for the prevention of a mishap. In most circumstances, the aircraft will be instructed to
      contact the SOF on the SOF frequency. The SOF must not perform ATC functions or
      transmit ATC instructions or clearances to an aircraft. If a need for ATC instructions
      arises while aircraft are on SOF frequency, the SOF will immediately instruct the aircraft
      to return to the ATC frequency. Note: See also Emergency Single Frequency Approach
      (SFA) paragraph 5.15.
   7.24.5. SOF Access to Control Tower and Vehicle. 52 OG/OGV will provide 52 OSS
   Airfield Operations a current SOF roster quarterly. Only personnel listed on the roster will
   be permitted unescorted access to the control Tower and use of the SOF vehicle. The SOF
   must inspect and sign AF 1800, Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report, when
   using the vehicle. Report any problems to AM Ops.
   7.24.6. Use of Headsets. To reduce unnecessary noise levels that can lead to a possible
   hazardous situation, the SOF will use the headset to the maximum extent possible to reduce
   noise during periods of local flying. The SOF should monitor control positions for traffic
   information, arrival/departure times, PIREP information, etc.
   7.24.7. Approval of SAB as a Divert Airfield. During wing flying and in conjunction with
   AM Ops, the SOF approves or disapproves the use of SAB as an alternate for other flying
   units. The decision should be based on ATC manning, forecasted weather, ramp space
   (coordination with TA required), and field status. Ability to support heavy aircraft is limited
   due to parking limitations. Outside wing flying, Tower Watch Supervisor approves or
   disapproves using the same procedures above. Note: ATC service may be limited outside
   forecast wing flying
7.25. Taking of Photographs.
   7.25.1. Flightline Photography.

       7.25.1.1. Photography in restricted areas is prohibited without the written or verbal
       permission of the 52 FW/CC or designated representative (52 FW/Public Affairs). The
       52 FW/CC has designated various agencies as representatives for controlling
       photography in their areas. All requests for photography, both official and personal,
       within a specific area, must be in writing and addressed to the responsible agency per
       SPANGDAHLEMABI 31-101. Maintenance control is responsible for the general
       flightline area. Urgent requests may be made verbally after coordination with SCC.
       These requests must be approved by the responsible agency prior to pictures being taken.
       7.25.1.2. Unauthorized photography within or of restricted areas will result in
       apprehension by 52 SFS and possible disciplinary action. Film and/or memory card, as
       appropriate, will be confiscated and turned over to 52 SFS Office of Investigations to be
       processed to ensure classified material or operations have not been photographed.
7.26. Special Visual Flight Rules (SVFR) Operations.
   7.26.1. Fixed wing special VFR operations are not authorized IAW DoD FLIP AP/2.
   7.26.2. Helicopter special VFR operations can be approved and shall be conducted IAW
   FAA JO 7110.65 and 52 OSS/OSA Ops Letter 13-1.
7.27. Over Flights. Aircraft transitioning Spangdahlem Class D airspace shall not over fly
housing or the base proper below 1000ft AGL. Only aircraft conducting approaches to
Spangdahlem are permitted to over-fly the airfield below 1000ft AGL. With Tower approval,
exceptions are authorized if required for mission completion (i.e. Kristoff Rescue, pipeline
operations, etc.) or during emergencies. Fly-bys require prior coordination with ATC and SOF
approval. Simulated airfield attacks shall be conducted at or above 1000ft AGL and require a
SOF in place to observe the attack.
7.28. Beacon Codes.
   7.28.1. VFR: Military VFR squawk in Germany is 0033. In standard formation, only lead
   will squawk. In a 2-ship non-standard formation, both aircraft squawk and in a 4-ship non-
   standard formation, lead and trailing aircraft squawk.
   7.28.2. IFR: If performing an instrument trail departure, the last aircraft will squawk 0032
   until rejoined to a standard formation. For radar trail recoveries, the last aircraft will squawk
   0032.
7.29. Clearances.
   7.29.1. IAW AFI 13-204v3, all aircraft departing Air Force installations must have a flight
   plan on file with AM Ops prior to take-off.
   7.29.2. IFR Clearances: An IFR clearance is mandatory anytime the weather is below
   1500ft ceiling and/or 5000m visibility. For A-10s departing IFR, tower will automatically
   coordinate with Langen for a 1000ft altitude block for 2-ships and a 3000ft (preferred)
   altitude block for 4-ships on departure. Note: 2000ft is the minimum block altitude required
   for 4-ships on departure.
7.30. Aircraft Diverts.
   7.30.1. When adverse weather conditions, suspension of runway operations, runway closure
   or navigational aid outages jeopardize safe landings at Spangdahlem, inbound aircraft will be
SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                           49


   diverted to suitable alternate bases, as directed by the 52 OG/CC or the SOF. To ensure
   efficient flight planning and control, the SOF, aircrews, weather, CP and other pertinent
   agencies will be notified as expeditiously as possible when conditions warrant the diversion
   of aircraft to alternate bases.
   7.30.2. If the potential exists for a missed approach (weather at or rapidly deteriorating to
   pilot weather minimums), pilots will coordinate missed approach intentions with
   Spangdahlem GCA prior to the final approach fix if a missed approach is likely (i.e. weather
   at or rapidly deteriorating to pilot weather minimums). If intentions are to return to the
   Spangdahlem GCA pattern for another attempt, pilots must request "local climb out in lieu of
   missed approach procedures". Local climb out is also required anytime aircraft intend to
   divert to the divert base. Only in an emergency situation will a pilot deviate from published
   missed approach procedures or GCA issued climb out instructions.
   7.30.3. When a non-emergency NATO or DoD aircraft requests to divert into Spangdahlem
   without PPR approval the following will occur: GCA or Tower will advise the aircraft to
   contact AM Ops Pilot-to-Dispatch on UHF frequency 278.175 or VHF frequency 138.4. AM
   Ops will gather aircraft call sign, type, home station and intentions, and will coordinate with
   TA for parking and service support. If supportable, AM Ops will issue a PPR and inform
   GCA or Tower that the aircraft is approved to land. Emergency aircraft will always receive a
   landing clearance no matter what servicing is available.
7.31. CMA Vehicle/Pedestrian/Emergency Vehicle Operations.
7.31.1 Refer to SPANGDAHLEMABI 13-203
7.32. EOD Range Procedures.
   7.32.1. When EOD (52 CES/ Flight Commander/Chief (CED) is planning operations they
   will notify AM Ops. AM Ops shall issue an airfield advisory on all EOD activity and inform
   Tower of range times. 52 CES/CED shall inform Tower prior to commencing any operations
   on the range. Tower will verify the height operations will reach and determine if operations
   can be approved. EOD activity should not impact wing flying. However, operations could
   be a factor for low-level flights (i.e. helicopters). 52 CES/CED will immediately cease
   operations when instructed by Tower.
7.33. Exercises.
   7.33.1. 52 FW/ Wing Plans, Programs and Inspections (XPI) or representative will brief 52
   OSS/OSA at least 48 hours in advance of any exercise that involves any ATC facility (Tower
   or GCA) or the airport movement area. 52 OSS/OSA must approve, in advance, exercises
   that include removing controllers to alternate facilities or to shelter areas.
   7.33.2. The use of Ramp 4 must be coordinated with the Airfield Manager at least 5 days in
   advance to de-conflict any transient PPRs.
7.34. Airfield Construction, Maintenance, and Special Activities.
   7.34.1. It is essential all construction projects including airfield repair and maintenance, and
   special activities that may impact airfield operations, will be coordinated with 52 OSS/OSA
   or designated representative prior to, during and upon completion.
 50                                        SPANGDAHLEMABI13-201 9 SEPTEMBER 2010


   7.34.2. Units managing airfield construction or maintenance projects will supply all details
   to Airfield Management for coordination. Managing agencies should coordinate as far in
   advance as practical before the project start date. 52 CES will invite the airfield manager and
   a flight safety representative to all pre-construction meetings involving projects that impact
   flying operations. Note: Construction crews will not be allowed on the CMA without prior
   coordination.
   7.34.3. For work on or near the taxiways, runway or infield (the area between the runway
   and TWY G or between the runway and TWY P), the work supervisors or base civil engineer
   contract monitor will coordinate vehicle and equipment movement with 52 OSS Airfield
   Management Operations (OSAM). All contractors will be escorted by an airfield driving
   qualified escort.
   7.34.4. Supervisors of grass cutting operations on or near the runway, and all taxiways, will
   coordinate with AM Ops on their location and work schedule prior to commencing and
   ensure a sweeper is present during their operation.
7.35. Military Authority Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft (MARSA).
   7.35.1. The German ATC system does not have a term for and does not define MARSA.
   The procedures below will be used for the departure of multiple flights under one call sign.
       7.35.1.1. Upon taxi, the flight lead will call Ground Control and state the total number of
       aircraft departing in the flight. If necessary, the flight lead will relay the call sign of the
       flight plan that needs to be delayed and picked up at a later time. Tower will advise
       Langen ACC of the delayed flight plan.            This will ensure the flight plans of the
       participating flights are delayed and can be picked up by the individual flights at a later
       time.
7.36. Night Vision Devices (NVD).
   7.36.1. NVD use or blackout operations are not authorized at Spangdahlem AB.
7.37. Air Base Defense. The GCA and/or Tower will notify the CP of any suspicious
unidentified aircraft operating within the confines of Spangdahlem’s airspace. Tower will notify
the CP immediately of any unidentified personnel movements around the airfield perimeter.
Specific procedures are outlined in the 52 FW Installation Security Plan.
7.38. UAS Operations. Spandahlem AB does not support UAS operations as a primary or
alternate location. Therefore, there is not dedicated infrastructure or procedures to support these
operations.
7.39. Tactical Arrival/Departure Produces (Attachment 11 and 12).
