                        C-17 DEBRIEFING CHECKLIST


                                 INTRODUCTION


This debriefing checklist is to be used, as a guide to assist the maintenance debriefer
in ensuring all pertinent information on a system malfunction is included on the
AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document. This checklist is
considered minimal and is not intended to replace system knowledge or common
sense. The debriefer is charged with the responsibility of questioning the aircrew to
make sure all symptoms of a malfunction are known and recorded on the AFTO Form
781. Remember, this may be the only information the technician will have to
determine the source of the problem.
Recommended changes to this checklist will be forwarded through channels to HQ
AMC/A4M.
1.   Instructions: Prior to debriefing:
     A. Ensure a Fault Reporting Manual is available for use by the flight crew
        during debriefing. The debriefing team members will review past
        debriefing forms, logs, or files to acquaint themselves with any
        repeat/recurring discrepancies.
     B. The appropriate maintenance specialty should be represented at the
        debriefing to help clarify discrepancies.


2.   Debriefing Procedures:
     A. The debriefing team leader will take charge of the debriefing and debrief
        the aircrew, utilizing this checklist as a guide.
     B. Review entire AFTO Form 781 for the mission. Using the questions in
        Section 2 of this checklist, ensure all open discrepancies are as complete
        and comprehensive as possible. Add any additional information provided
        during the debrief.
     C. Flight crews will enter a fault code for each discrepancy in the fault code
        block of the AFTO Form 781.
     D. Cross check previous repeat/recurring discrepancies against mission
        AFTO Form 781 and annotate in accordance with AMCI 21-101.
     E. Ensure Aircraft Diagnostics and Integrated Test System (ADITS) fault
        disc is provided by aircrew for input into G081.
     F. Determine if aircraft was flown low level over salt water and act as
        necessary to comply with T.O. 1-1-691, Aircraft Weapon System Cleaning
        and Corrosion Control.
     G. Ensure ALL locations where the aircraft stopped and chemically
        disinfected for Foot and Mouth Disease, an entry is made in the 781A’s.
        Debriefers will document this information in G081 using screen 9051,
        with work unit code 02400 to create the Foot and Mouth Decontamination
        discrepancy; G081 will automatically enter this information in the aircraft
        history. Report this information to HQ AMC/A4MJS; DSN 779-2622 /
        Commercial 618-229-2622. Accurate tracking is essential. Potentially
        damaging long-term effects of decontamination on sensitive aircraft parts
        may occur.
     H. Determine if aircraft was flown through predicted areas of low
        volcanic ash, an entry is made in the 781A’s. Debriefers will
        document this information in GO81 using screen XXXX, with work
        unit code XXXX to create the volcanic ash discrepancy; G081 will
        automatically enter this information in the aircraft history.


3.   Load maintenance built-in test fault (MBIT) discrepancies from non-
     ADITS reporting line replaceable units into G081 as follows: “BIT
     FAULT AVIONICS” or “BIT FAULT NON-AVIONICS” followed by
     the fault in plain text.
