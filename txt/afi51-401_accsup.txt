AFI 51-401, 19 July 1994, is supplemented as follows. This publication applies to all Air Combat Com-
mand (ACC) units and members. It also applies to ACC Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units and
members when mobilized and to ACC-gained Air National Guard (ANG) units and members when mobi-
lized. However, in the absence of mobilization, Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) training and reporting is
still an annual requirement for ACC-gained ANG units and members upon publication in ANGIND 2.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This issuance aligns the Air Combat Command supplement with the Air Force Instruction. This is the
second issuance of a supplement to AFI 51-401. This supplement provides for computerized LOAC
training to meet annual training requirements.
2.11.4. (Added) Commanders at all levels will ensure that plans, policies, procedures, and operations
within their areas of responsibility are consistent with the international legal obligations of the United
States under the LOAC. Staff judge advocates will assist commanders, to the maximum extent possible,
in meeting this obligation.
2.11.5. (Added) Staff judge advocates assigned to ANG units gained by ACC may utilize current training
material provided to the unit under any training program approved by HQ USAF, HQ AFPC, HQ ACC, or
NGB. However, they shall review all such training material in advance for currency. They shall monitor
all such training and ensure that a judge advocate is available to promptly respond to LOAC-related ques-
tions posed by any person attending a required LOAC training session.
3.1.1. (Added) Commanders at all levels will ensure that all personnel within their command receive
training annually in LOAC commensurate with their duties and responsibilities. The training will
include, as a minimum, LOAC training on those subjects specified by paragraph 3.1, AFI 51-401. This

training may be accomplished through briefings or through use of ACC-approved computerized training
tools. Computerized training is not necessarily a substitute for active involvement between judge advo-
cates and units tasked to perform real world deployments. Particular attention must be paid to the LOAC
needs of aircrews, medical personnel, security forces, and any other deploying units the base SJA deems
as having special LOAC needs. In addition, briefings given to operations and staff personnel such as air-
crews, security police, medical personnel, and other personnel likely to encounter particular LOAC issues
in the training will be integrated into unit exercises and will, to the maximum extent feasible, incorporate
realistic LOAC scenarios tailored to the particular mission of the unit and the categories of personnel par-
ticipating.
3.2. Staff judge advocates of ACC wings will forward their annual LOAC training report to HQ ACC/
JAM, either directly or through their numbered Air Force staff judge advocate (as determined by the lat-
ter) to arrive at HQ ACC/JAM NLT 15 January of each year.
3.3. (Added) Staff judge advocates assigned to ANG units gained by ACC shall prepare a single annual
report for the ANG unit to which staff judge advocate is assigned (and for each of its subordinate ANG
units). Such staff judge advocates shall prepare a separate report for each geographically separated ANG
unit for which such SJA provides judge advocate support. Such reports shall be forwarded to HQ ACC/
JAM, NLT 10 January of each calendar year and shall be prepared in the format contained in Attachment
1 (Added). The staff judge advocate submitting any such report shall also submit information copies of
the report to the staff judge advocate of the numbered air force which gains the ANG unit for which the
report is prepared and to the staff judge advocate of the unit’s state ANG Headquarters.
5.3.5. A copy of every initial and subsequent report of investigation into an alleged LOAC violation for-
warded to the Judge Advocate General will be simultaneously forwarded to HQ ACC/JAM.
