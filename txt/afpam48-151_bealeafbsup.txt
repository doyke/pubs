This supplement implements and extends the guidance of Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 48-151,
Thermal Injury. The goal of the heat stress management program is to prevent heat-related
injuries through education and monitoring. This supplement describes 9 RW’s procedures for
use in conjunction with basic AFPAM. It applies to all units with a mission involving the 9th
Reconnaissance Wing and subordinate units assigned, attached, or supported by the 9th
Reconnaissance Wing. It applies to the Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard
units on Beale AFB installation. Changes to the procedures in this publication are not authorized
without approval of 9AMDS/SGPB. Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s through the appropriate
functional’s chain of command. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management
of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Information Management
System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This
supplement incorporates information specific to the 9th Reconnaissance Wing to AFPAM 48-
151, Thermal Injury.

3.1.4.1. (Added) 9th Aerospace Medical Squadron, Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) Flight
(9AMDS/SGPB) will:
3.1.4.1.1. (Added) Conduct hourly WBGT measurements during the normal duty hours when
the National Weather Service forecast temperatures for 85°F and higher.
3.1.4.1.2. (Added) Record the WBGT readings in the WBGT log.
3.1.4.1.3. (Added) Report the WBGT index to the 9th Reconnaissance Wing Command Post
via telephone for dissemination to base personnel and the community (through the giant voice
mass notification system) when the index is equal or greater than 85°F. This organization is
notified every time the flag condition changes after the initial call. The command post extension
is x5700.
3.1.4.1.4. (Added) Update the current WBGT reading in the Bioenvironmental Engineering
share point. Updates must include date, time (hourly), flag condition, and work/rest cycles.
3.1.4.1.5. (Added) Contact Public Affairs when the Bioenvironmental Engineering share point
is inaccessible. Public Affairs will send out a base wide email informing units that the
Bioenvironmental Engineering share point is temporarily down. They will also provide the
current WBGT reading and work/rest cycles until further notice by the Bioenvironmental
Engineering Flight. Call Public Affairs to notify about share point inaccessibility at x8887, or
email 9RW.PA@beale.af.mil.
3.1.4.1.6. (Added) WBGT readings will be taken until 1700. Solar heating declines past 1600,
and continues to decrease as the sun sets, therefore, the WBGT flag condition at 1700 will
remain in effect until 2100 at which time it will be reduced to the next lower category.
Subsequent flag reductions will occur at 4 hr increments until WBGT flag conditions are reduced
to the lowest level.
