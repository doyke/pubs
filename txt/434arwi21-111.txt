This is the initial publication of 434ARWI21-111, Aircraft Maintenance Debriefing and Reports.

1. Procedures: Debriefing will normally be accomplished in a centralized location in Building
439, Room 209 (Second floor of Dock 1, next door to the Maintenance Operations Center
(MOC). Debriefer may utilize room 208 for the debrief when there is no other controller
available and or depending on the aircraft landing status. Debriefing responsibility is assigned to
the MOC.
   1.1. Debriefing is conducted immediately after the termination of each flown sortie/mission
   or when a flown sortie/mission is aborted.
 2                                                          434ARWI21-111 31 OCTOBER 2012


        1.1.1. Ground aborts do not require aircrew debriefing. Abort/Incident worksheet will be
        completed by the crew chief and then the Expediter will deliver the worksheet and
        aircraft forms binder to MOC as soon as possible but prior to the end of shift.
     1.2. Debriefing record files will be developed for each aircraft. Files will be arranged by
     aircraft identification number and will include a debriefing sortie recap for the last six sorties
     to aid in identifying repeat/recurring discrepancies. Record files will be maintained in the
     MOC.
     1.3. The contracted Transient Alert is responsible for all transient aircraft and notifying
     MOC of all transient aircraft. IAW: 21-101, 6.2.2.27, Transient Alert will ensure all
     maintenance discrepancies are marked Mission Essential (ME) or Mission Contributing
     (MC).
2. Prior to Landing:
     2.1. Thirty minutes prior to termination of flight or as soon as UHF or VHF contact can be
     established, the flight crew will call the 434 ARW Command Post (434 ARW/CP) and
     provide an aircraft maintenance status code identifying any system malfunctions. The 434
     ARW/CP will provide the MOC with the aircraft maintenance status for relay to the
     Production Superintendent (Pro Super). MOC will provide CP with aircraft parking location.
        2.1.1. Since Maintenance Status Code A-3 (NMC) discrepancies affect break rate and
        health to fleet, special emphasis will be placed on these problems.
3. Aircrew Responsibilities:
     3.1. Call command post 30 minutes prior to landing with an aircraft maintenance status of
     aircraft systems.
     3.2. The aircraft commander or boom operator, and crewmembers with knowledge of
     discrepancies will hand-carry the aircraft 781 forms binder to the debrief session.
     3.3. The aircraft commander will ensure aircrews enter all discrepancies into the AFTO
     Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Documents. MOC will assist the aircrew in
     entering the proper system capability codes when documenting discrepancies IAW AFI 21-
     101 and AFI 11-2KC-135V3.
        3.3.1. Fill out the AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels Document Log, and the DD Form 791,
        Aerial Tanker In-flight Issue Log (if required) for all refuel, defuel, and aerial refueling
        operations.
     3.4. The aircraft commander will ensure all AF Forms 315 and AF Forms 15 are completed
     legibly, validated and signed and placed with the AF Form 664.
        3.4.1. All fuel documents and forms will be retained by the Aircraft Commander and
        turned into their respective Squadron Aviation Resource Management (SARM) office.
     3.5. The aircraft commander and pertinent aircrew will ensure the US Air Card is accounted
     for. If missing, inform the Production Supervisor, Expediter or crew chief and annotate the
     discrepancy in the forms.
     3.6. On the AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance, the
     Aircraft Commander will ensure the “condition after flight” is signed and the correct number
434ARWI21-111 31 OCTOBER 2012                                                                       3


   of discrepancies is annotated in block 7. They will also ensure the flying hours; full stops;
   total landing, and engine cycles are documented, blocks 9, 10, 12, and 13, respectively.
      3.6.1. The reverse side of 781H will be annotated in red for all fuel offloads and the
      corresponding block will be signed and dated.
   3.7. The aircraft commander, boom operator and pertinent aircrew will ensure the AFTO
   Forms 781 are properly completed and legible according to AFI 11-401, Atch 2, Aviation
   Management
   3.8. Aircrew will ensure the original forms are kept with the aircraft forms and given to
   MOC upon return to home station.
4. Responsibilities of the MOC Debriefer:
   4.1. Coordinate with Expediter and Pro Super to ensure all necessary specialists attend
   debriefing. If requested specialists are not available, MOC Debriefer will use, AMCI SUP
   CL4, KC-135/E/R/T Debriefing Checklist.
   4.2. Remove all applicable forms from the forms binder, i.e., AFTO Form 781, fuel
   documents. Do not tear out forms.
      4.2.1. Arrange forms in sequence to ensure AFTO 781 Series forms are not missing;
      ensure forms are properly completed to include blocks 1 through 18, 39 and block 40 of
      the AFTO Form 781.
      4.2.2. MOC will ensure all fuel receipts are accurately completed, and annotated on the
      AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels Documentation Log, located in the aircraft forms binder.
      4.2.3. As a last check, ensure any fuel receipts (AF Form 15, United States Air Force
      Invoice and AF Form 315, United States Air Force Avfuels Invoice) are removed from
      the aircraft forms.
   4.3. Collect a copy AFTO Form 781 and audit to insure correct takeoff time (Zulu) date and
   aircraft tail number are correct. NOTE: At this point, the Debriefer may release the
   flight crew.
   4.4. Load the open aircraft discrepancies into the GO81 computer.         File copy AFTO form
   781’s in a designated PS & D retrieval area for processing.
   4.5. Contact the Expediter responsible for the aircraft to retrieve the aircraft forms binder.
5. Plans, Scheduling and Documentation Responsibilities.
   5.1. Plans, Scheduling and Documentation (PS &D) will retrieve copy AFTO form 781 from
   MOC NLT the next duty day.
   5.2. PS & D will review AFTO form 781 for accuracy, contact 72 ARS/CCE and 74
   ARS/CCE daily to verify information and input into appropriate MIS (GO-81) NLT the next
   duty day.
   5.3. PS & D will hand carry processed original AFTO form 781s to 434 OSS/DOTF NLT
   0900 each duty day.
6. After Duty Hours, Contingency Operations and Deployed Operations:
4                                                       434ARWI21-111 31 OCTOBER 2012


    6.1. During MIS down times, or when deployed and MIS is not available, AMC IMT 278
    and AMCI SUP CL4, KC-135/E/R/T Debriefing Checklist will be used to ensure accurate
    debriefing information is obtained. When Maintenance Data System Analysis personnel are
    not deployed, the deployed Commander will designate an individual or activity to perform
    the analysis function.     MOC personnel/debriefers will use blank printouts as manual
    documentation method and forward documents to home station for data transcribing by the
    most expeditious means available. All documents will be turned into the MOC upon return to
    home station. Automated debrief tools should be used as the primary debriefing instrument,
    if availability permits.
       6.1.1. The MOC will maintain a minimum 60-day supply of hard copy debrief forms for
       the purpose of deployments and for flight line historical reference during GO81 system
       failure. These debrief forms will be maintained in the MOC and also a two week supply
       will be maintained in the cross country kits. Hard copy forms will be used to update the
       GO81 system upon redeployment or system repair.
    6.2. For aircraft returning to home station during non-duty days/hours, the recovering crew
    chief will conduct the aircraft maintenance debrief at the aircraft using AMC IMT 278,
    AMCI SUP CL4, and KC-135/E/R/T Debriefing Checklist available in the cross country kit.
    Aircraft forms and all applicable documentation will be left in the Maintenance Debrief room
    (Building 439, Room 209) for reconciliation and entering of information into G081 during
    the next normal duty day.
