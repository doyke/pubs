                             FCF/OCF CONTINUITY GUIDE

A2.1. Requirements:
   A2.1.1. This guide is to be used in conjunction with the FCF Briefing/Debriefing guide
   (Attachment 2).
   A2.1.2. FCF/OCF's will be tracked in the "Quality Assurance Tracking and Trend Analysis
   System" (QANTTAS) computer program.
   A2.1.3. All FCF/OCF PILOT coordination will be done by Quality Assurance (QA).
   A2.1.4. A new 1F-16C-6CL-1 checklist will be initiated for each FCF/OCF attempt.
   A2.1.5. A new QANTTAS Report Control Number (RCN) will be assigned for each
   FCF/OCF or continuing attempt.
A2.2. Prior to Briefing:
   A2.2.1. After determination is made that an FCF/OCF is required, 301 AMXS will notify
   QA when all maintenance is complete and the aircraft has been pre-flighted.
   A2.2.2. After the aircraft has been pre-flighted, 301 AMXS personnel will bring the active
   aircraft forms along with the transcribed forms, to QA. Review all AFTO Forms for proper
   documentation, completion of required inspections, and proper clearing of all red symbol
   discrepancies.
   A2.2.3. Print a copy of the aircraft #380 CAMS screen and compare entries to the active
   AFTO Forms 781A.
   A2.2.4. Create a job in the CAMS (screen #073 option 03) stating "FCF/OCF REQUIRED
   DUE TO ________________.” (reason for FCF).
   A2.2.5. In the next open block of the AFTO Form 781A, enter the exact verbiage as created
   in the CAMS generated discrepancy. The symbol for the FCF will be a red dash (-) and the
   "When Discovered Code” (WDC) will be "P". In the "Corrective Action" block enter the red
   FCF stamp. The pilot will complete the required stamp information after flight completion.
   A2.2.6. Initiate pilot’s 1F-16C-6CL-1 FCF/OCF Checklist.
   A2.2.7. Enter the FCF/OCF basic information in QANTTAS. ** NOTE ** The Job Control
   Number (JCN) assigned to an FCF will remain with that aircraft until it releases regardless of
   the number of FCF attempts. However, each successive attempt will require another
   QANTTAS entry and a new RCN assigned.
   A2.2.8. Proceed to the aircraft parking area, perform a preflight QVI of the aircraft paying
   particular attention to the paneled areas where maintenance was performed.
   A2.2.9. Notify 457 FS Operations that the aircraft and forms are ready. Instruct FCF pilot to
   assemble at the QA office for a FCF briefing and forms review. Verify engine start time.
   A2.2.10. Notify MOCC that the FCF/OCF is ready.
   A2.2.11. Notify MOCC when the briefing is in progress.

A2.3. Briefing/Debriefing:
     A2.3.1. Brief/Debrief the pilot in accordance with the FCF Briefing/Debriefing Guide
     (Attachment 2).
     A2.3.2. When the pilot briefing is complete, notify MOCC and the Expediter that the pilot is
     stepping to the aircraft.
     A2.3.3. A QA Inspector will accompany the pilot to the aircraft and assist him with his
     walk-around inspection. The inspector will act as the liaison between the pilot and the 301
     AMXS Expediter in the event problems arise. The inspector will remain with the aircraft
     during launch and taxi.
A2.4. Post-debriefing:
     A2.4.1. Retain the FCF/OCF checklist whether aircraft releases or not.
     A2.4.2. Complete and close-out the FCF/OCF QANTTAS entry. If an unsuccessful (no-
     release) FCF/OCF was flown, enter the corrective action of the code 3 discrepancy on the
     FCF/OCF QANTTAS entry.
     A2.4.3. If the FCF/OCF is successful (releases), forward the completed checklist to PS&D
     for filing. If the FCF is unsuccessful, retain the checklist until the FCF does release; at that
     time all checklists will be forwarded to PS&D.
     A2.4.4. If the FCF/OCF generates a CODE 3 discrepancy that will require another FCF, QA
     will review the corrective action which cleared the discrepancy for completeness and
     correctness.
     A2.4.5. Review the QANTTAS FCF/OCF section at least monthly for trends that may
     indicate problems requiring further investigation and analysis. Identify deficient areas to the
     Chief of QA for required review and/or action.

                        FCF/OCF BRIEFING/DEBRIEFING GUIDE

A3.1. Pilot Briefing:
   A3.1.1. Brief pilot as to the purpose of the FCF. Ensure pilot is aware of any supplements to
   FCF checklist.
   A3.1.2. Discuss prior maintenance problems and discrepancies documented against the
   aircraft. Discussion must include all affected systems and equipment pertinent to the FCF.
   A3.1.3. Brief pilot on documentation required to complete the AFTO 781 series forms and
   the FCF checklist.
   A3.1.4. Review the aircraft Weight and Balance documents.
A3.2. Pilot debriefing:
   A3.2.1. MOC has the responsibility to notify QA when the aircraft lands. Either meet the
   pilot at the parking spot or in debriefing. Discuss any and all problems incurred during the
   flight. Have the debriefer call for specialist support as required.
   A3.2.2. Ensure the pilot has properly documented all discrepancies in the AFTO Form
   781A. Be sure the pilot clears the FCF entry if FCF releases. If a "NO RELEASE"
   condition exists, the pilot will leave the FCF discrepancy open for the next attempt. Be sure
   the pilot completes the FCF checklist and fills out page P-1.
   A3.2.3. Work with the AMXS debriefer on duty to assist in assigning proper discrepancy
   symbols to FCF discrepancies.
