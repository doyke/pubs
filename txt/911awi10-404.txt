1. GENERAL: The ability of a commander to recall his or her unit members is one of the basic
premises for a unit to mobilize, meet its wartime commitments and disseminate information to
unit members in defined emergencies. To accomplish this, the commander must have a plan that
ensures he or she will be able to contact and assemble all assigned personnel within the required
response time as designated in the mobilization order or through determined direction of the
commander. The response time could be as early as the time stipulated in the Designed
Operational Capability (DOC) Statement for units which have a DOC statement and/or as
indicated by the installation commander’s informed decision on any defined emergency
situation.
2. RESPONSIBILITIES:
     2.1. Wing Commander will:
        2.1.1. Ensure each unit has a recall plan in place to meet wartime and peacetime recall
        requirements.
        2.1.2. Identify in writing a primary and alternate Wing Recall Program Manager.
        2.1.3. Ensure accurate and timely reporting of recall results.
911AWI10-404 9 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                3


     2.1.4. Ensure the plan includes accountability procedures to be used during a natural
     disaster or national emergency.
     2.1.5. Ensure the Wing exercises and conducts a no-notice communications test at least
     once annually to demonstrate the ability to contact all assigned Wing personnel.
     2.1.6. Program adequate funding in annual budget estimates to conduct at least one
     communications test each fiscal year.
     2.1.7. Ensure Wing Operating Instruction for unit recall procedures is created.
  2.2. Group Commanders will:
     2.2.1. Identify in writing a primary and alternate program monitor for the group.
  2.3. 911 AW Command Post will:
     2.3.1. Initiate 911 AW directed communication tests and actual recalls via message or
     other alternate means, monitor NAF/Local Authority reporting and forward results to 911
     AW CAT.
     2.3.2. Initiate communication tests and actual recalls for 911 AW assigned personnel,
     monitor Directorate reporting, and forward results to 911 AW CAT. (See Attachment 2
     for format.)
        2.3.2.1. Monitor units’ status during 911 AW-directed communications tests or
        actual    recall.
        2.3.2.2. Monitor actual unit recalls due to real world disasters or contingencies.
     2.3.3. Consolidate unit reports and forward to 911 AW Command Center and 911 AW
     CAT. (See Attachment 3for message format.)
        2.3.3.1. Function as the Commander’s representative for initiating and monitoring
        recall progression and accomplishing appropriate recall and/or communications test
        reporting. Controllers will not be designated a key alerter for groups/squadrons,
        outside of CP personnel notifications.
     2.3.4. Maintain a current recall roster for each assigned unit to include GSUs and on-
     base tenant organizations in case of local natural disaster/emergency.
     2.3.5. Maintain recall and communications test results for the Wing.
     2.3.6. Upon initiation of an actual recall or mobilization submit reports in accordance
     with applicable guidance and procedures.
  2.4. 911 AW Contingency Action Team (CAT) will:
     2.4.1. Monitor, compile and report results of 911 AW directed communications tests or
     actual recalls at the direction of the commander, vice commander or other designated
     authority.
  2.5. 911 MSG/DPMD will:
     2.5.1. Provide the personal contact information for the Emergency Notification System
     (ENS) database.
  2.6. Unit Commanders will:
4                                                         911AWI10-404 9 SEPTEMBER 2011


       2.6.1. Appoint primary and alternate recall program monitors in writing and ensure those
       appointed are aware of responsibilities and reporting procedures. Dual assignment of Unit
       Control Center monitors as recall program monitors is encouraged for continuity of
       effort.
    2.7. Unit Recall Program Monitors will:
       2.7.1. Ensure unit recall programs fall into the guidelines of this regulation.
       2.7.2. Establish Key Alerters in your unit based on geographic area so that it is cost
       effective to recall personnel.
       2.7.3. Develop a positive validation system for monthly verification of individual,
       address, and telephone data. Accurate information is essential for a current notification
       roster of all assigned personnel, as it is used to notify under alert, actual recall, and test
       conditions.
       2.7.4. Provide Command Post with a monthly update of recall rosters to include specific
       instructions for use of unit recall program and pyramid rosters.
       2.7.5. Report recall and communications test results to the Command Post with timely
       updates for proper reporting to higher headquarters.
       2.7.6. Develop procedures for recall or mobilization under degraded communications
       conditions (comm-out).
       2.7.7. Maintain a specific alternate recall plan so that messengers can be sent to
       members’ homes if they cannot be contacted by phone.
       2.7.8. Ensure recall procedures include provisions for these notifications to be made by
       unit members. (Units may establish contacts with local law enforcement, civil defense,
       Civil Air Patrol (CAP), and other local agencies for assistance in notifying personnel;
       however, these sources should not be considered the primary means of notification.
       During an actual comm-out situation, other priorities would probably limit the support
       these agencies could provide.) Alternate recall plans should be flexible. For example, the
       comm-out condition may only affect the base and immediate surrounding area. In some
       cases, contact via messenger may not be practical (for example, members who reside out
       of state or long distances from base).
       2.7.9. Become qualified through training from a certified ENS administrator (Command
       Post personnel), then maintain the ENS database for their respective unit by validating
       unit data monthly in conjunction with monthly recall roster updates.
    2.8. Unit Members will:
       2.8.1. Provide the following mandatory information: name, address, ALL phone numbers
       to include home, business, cellular, and email addresses. If home address is a post office
       box, maintain specific directions to the member’s home. Failure to do so can have an
       adverse effect on mobilization of the unit.
       2.8.2. Notify their unit recall program monitor with changes to address, phone numbers
       or email.
911AWI10-404 9 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  5


     2.8.3. Military members are required to provide up-to-date contact information via the
     Virtual Military Personnel Flight Application (vMPF). Civilian members who wish to
     provide personal contact information should do so using the ENS self service application.
     All members are responsible for the accuracy of their own contact information.
  2.9. Unit Network Control Centers and CSTs will work with the Enterprise Service Desk
  and local communications squadron planners to ensure each workstation is loaded with the
  current version and correct PID of the IWS/Alerts client software. Updates to the IWS Alerts
  desktop client will have to be coordinated with the host base MCCC and I-NOSC supporting
  the local base under the AFNET enterprise.
3. RECALL ROSTERS.
  3.1. Units will create a pyramid notification system (recall roster) that includes specific
  instructions for use, notification types and phraseology, a pyramid notification system and
  Excel spreadsheet with information identified in para 2.10.1. (See Attachment 4 for
  spreadsheet format.)
     3.1.1. Recall Pyramids. The pyramid recall system will utilize quality considerations
     such as: key alerters will have availability and access to communications necessary to
     make notifications; consider grouping all those who live in the same distant community
     and members who do not have a street address will provide brief directions to their
     homes.
         3.1.1.1. Group Pyramids will begin at the group and will include all assigned
         squadrons.
         3.1.1.2. Unit Pyramids will begin with the group and will include every individual in
         the unit to include civilians, traditional reservists, Air Reserve Technicians, and
         Active Guard and Reserve personnel.
  3.2. Recall rosters will:
     3.2.1. Include specific instructions for use, notification phraseology, pyramids, and Excel
     spreadsheets.
     3.2.2. Be responsive and cost effective when possible. Consolidate personnel by area
     and/or ZIP Code where practical to better facilitate comm-out procedures.
     3.2.3. Specify alternate procedures in the event of the loss of primary communications.
     3.2.4. Comply with the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, Title 5, U.S.C., Section
     552a, as amended and AFI 33-332.
     3.2.5. Include procedures for reporting results of an actual or test notification to the
     recall program monitor for timely reporting. See paragraph 6 for reporting procedures.
     3.2.6. Consider operations security (OPSEC) in all actions.
     3.2.7. Recall rosters will identify personnel essential to the unit in the event a Type 2
     Essential Personnel Recall is initiated.
4. NOTIFICATION SYSTEM.
6                                                         911AWI10-404 9 SEPTEMBER 2011

    Procedures) as the primary means with manual telephones being an alternate means. Local
    911 AW/CP procedures for activating/utilization of (AtHoc) are maintained in Command
    Post (Attachment 6). Unless absolutely essential to the mission, do not use radio, television,
    or newspapers to notify individuals of an alert to mobilize until DoD has provided detailed
    information to Congress and the public.
    4.3. Upon direction from AFRC Public Affairs, the Wing Commander will use the news
    media to expedite recall. The unit public affairs office provides guidance and assistance
    concerning the release of this information.
    4.4. When notifying unit members, relay the message directly to the member. (PIN
    validation will suffice when ENS is used.) Messages to co-workers, family members,
    answering machines, etc., do not constitute contact.
