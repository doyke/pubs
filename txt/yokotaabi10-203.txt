1. General. The Yokota Crisis Action Team (CAT) provides the 374 AW Commander (374
AW/CC) a seamless, integrated, and effective command and control (C2) organization. Under
the Commander’s authority, this organization executes command responsibilities during crises
and contingencies which exceed that of normal day-to-day C2 structures and consists of
retaining, to the maximum extent possible, the mission capabilities of Yokota Air Base. When
activated, the CAT is capable of devoting its full time and attention to how crises affect mission
execution and is charged with eliminating or alleviating detrimental mission impact. The ability
to plan, direct, coordinate, and exercise C2 of all wing forces is inherent to CAT operations. 374
AW/XP manages the CAT program and its facilities on behalf of 374 AW/CC.
2. CAT Locations. The primary location for the CAT is within the 374 AW Command Post
(374 AW/CP) restricted area, in the basement of Building 315. The alternate location is the 2nd
floor of Bldg 955.

3. CAT Organization and Functions. The CAT maintains the ability to conduct 24-hour
operations, which normally consists of two 12-hour shifts. The commander or designated
alternate can direct full CAT activation or assign a smaller, tailored contingent in response to
specific command requirements. Members may also be released after full activation based upon
further delineation of requirements. Full CAT activation includes the Commander’s Senior
Staff, the CAT Staff, Group Representatives, and the Advisory Support Staff. Squadron
Commanders are not required in the CAT location, but in the case of full activation, will report
to their Unit Control Centers and monitor communications via DCO. Additional personnel may
be tasked to join or brief the CAT as the situation dictates. As a matter of clarification, unless
otherwise directed by the 374 AW/CC or designated alternate, all organizations noted above will
assemble upon CAT activation.
     3.1. The Commander’s Senior Staff consists of the Vice Commander, the Operations (OG),
     Maintenance (MXG), Mission Support (MSG), and Medical Group (MDG) Commanders,
     and the Command Chief. The 515th Air Mobility Operations Group (AMOG) Commander
     may join the Senior Staff, as required. The Senior Staff executes overall command and
     control to ensure the Wing’s mission and the installation’s support functions continue to the
     maximum extent possible.
     3.2. The CAT Staff consists of the Director, Executive Officer, Administrative Staff, CSA,
     and Support personnel.
     3.3. The CAT Group Representatives consist of members from the OG, MXG, MSG, MDG,
     and Wing Staff Agency (WSA). A member from the 730 AMS may also join the CAT, as
     required.
     3.4. The CAT Advisory Support Staff (full activation) consists of members from the Anti
     Terrorism Office (ATO), Staff Judge Advocate, Safety, Public Affairs, Weather, Intelligence,
     and the Installation Deployment Officer (IDO). All positions will meet with the CAT for the
     initial activation.

   10.3. A Line Badge granting access to the Command Post is a requirement for admittance to
   the primary CAT facility. See your local Security Manager for process guidance.
   10.4. Group Commanders and WSA Chiefs are responsible for ensuring that their designated
   (IAW 4.3.2.) representatives are adequately trained on CAT operations, individual Group
   responsibilities and capabilities, and have the resources and access required to fulfill their
   duties.
11. Operations Security (OPSEC).
   11.1. CAT members will follow strict OPSEC procedures at all times. It is the responsibility
   of all personnel to properly safeguard sensitive and classified material and to properly
   dispose of such information when no longer needed. Refer to the Critical Information List
   for further guidance.
12. Communications Security (COMSEC).
   12.1. Ensure that all two-way communication devices are left outside of the secure facility.
   12.2. To the maximum extent possible, all information will be passed via secure
   communications. On an exceptional basis, as determined by the 374 AW/CC, certain
   communication restrictions may be lifted.
      12.2.1. SIPR Network and VoSIP communications are the standard. If unable,
      unclassified information should be sent via encrypted NIPR Network email, the
      utilization of Land Mobile Radios (LMR), and/or the use of runners, when applicable. If
      a situation precludes the use of all other options, DSN lines will be primary over that of
      commercial land lines or cell phones.
      12.2.2. To avoid OPSEC/COMSEC violations, when handling inadvertent non-secure
      communications, defer to the following procedure. When answering a non-secure line,
      state to all in the vicinity, “open line.” Once the call is complete, state “closed line.” The
      same procedure will be used for secure calls using the terminology, “secure up/down.”
      Personnel will not open a non-secure line when a secure call or discussion is in progress
      and vice versa.

   12.3. As funding allows, all work stations within the primary CAT facility will be equipped
   with push-to-talk handsets.
13. Battle Rhythm.
   13.1. A Battle Rhythm is subject to situational development and current leadership guidance.
   The 374 AW/CC, in coordination with the CAT Director, will establish a Battle Rhythm as
   conditions permit.
      13.1.1. For Exercise purposes, senior leaders will changeover and receive briefings at
      0700 and 1900 local time. For a seamless transition between shifts, leadership on the
      CAT floor should plan changeover to include overlap and time to build continuity.
14. Physical Security/Entry Control.
   14.1. The primary CAT facility is within the 374 AW/CP Restricted Area. Command Post
   personnel have authority and control over entry procedures.
   14.2. Members without the appropriate line badge access must be signed in on a visitor’s
   registry and escorted while in the restricted area.
15. Relocation. The alternate location for the CAT is the second floor of BLDG 955.
Relocation procedures will be according to the CAT RELOCATION CHECKLIST. 374
AW/XPI will verify and manage the mission capability of the alternate facility.
16. Deactivation. The CAT Director will release the CAT from duty when directed by the 374
AW/CC. The CAT Director will coordinate with the EOC, when active, to release UCC
personnel to their respective commanders for deactivation.
17. Coordinating Agencies. Attachment 2 depicts applicable command relationships.
   17.1. The 374 AW Command Post (CP) is the primary agency authorized to communicate
   higher headquarters direction to operational organizations. CP is the only installation C2
   function authorized to receive and process Emergency Action Messages (EAM) and prepare
   and transmit AF operational reports (AF OPREP-3). The CP provides C2 support to wing
   and tenant units to include relaying command direction, flight following, and operational
   reporting instructions.
      17.1.1. 374 AW/XP will coordinate with CP to ensure seamless, integrated, and effective
      CAT operations.
   17.2. The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is activated by the 374 AW/CC in response
   to emergencies and/or recovery efforts during incidents that exceed normal, steady-state
   capability. The EOC is the focal point of support for an Incident Commander concerning
   operations at an incident site. The EOC is comprised of 15 Emergency Support Functions
   (ESF) to include additional functional experts and agencies, as required.
      17.2.1. During a contingency, the EOC may be activated by the 374 AW/CC during or in
      anticipation of emergency response and recovery requirements.
      17.2.2. The EOC will provide situational awareness to the CAT regarding all incidents
      and recovery efforts that have the potential to negatively impact Yokota Air Base mission
      capabilities. For all other cases, incident status reports will be relayed to the CAT as
      conditions permit.
YOKOTAABI10-203 9 MAY 2012                                                                 11


     17.2.3. To provide visibility to the entire installation, the EOC will plot incidents and
     chemical zone conditions via UL/UC2
     17.2.4. When on-scene requirements surpass the installation’s capabilities to include
     local capabilities acquired through Mutual Aid Agreements (MAAs), the EOC will seek
     non-local support through the CAT.
     17.2.5. As a general understanding, the primary mission of the EOC will be emergency
     management and support, while the CAT will focus on retaining Yokota Air Base
     mission capabilities. This does not preclude effective communications nor limits the
     ability to work together as particular situations may dictate.
