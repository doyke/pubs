                                           Chapter 1

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Command and Control.
   1.1.1. The 100th Air Refueling Wing Commander (100 ARW/CC) is ultimately responsible
   for airfield and air traffic control operations. The Airfield Operations Flight (100 OSS/OSA)
   executes the Airfield Management Operations (AM Ops) and Air Traffic Control (ATC)
   missions.
   1.1.2. Recommendations for improving this instruction are encouraged and should be
   forwarded to the RAFM Airfield Operations Board (AOB) through 100 OSS/OSA or other
   board members. When necessary, all provisional changes will be initiated and coordinated
   with/by 100 OSS/OSA.
   1.1.3. This instruction will be reviewed by 100 OSS/OSA annually, prior to the fourth
   quarter AOB. Review will determine currency and correctness of the instruction. If updates
   are required, 100 OSS/OSA will initiate a revision/rewrite. NOTE: It is imperative all base
   agencies with procedures tasking Airfield Operations (ATC, AM Ops) allow 100 OSS/OSA
   to review and coordinate on any/all Letters of Procedures and OPLANS prior to
   implementation. IAW AFI 13-204v3, paragraph 4.1.3., Airfield Operations requires a
   mandatory 30 day familiarization period before implementation of any LOPs or OPLANs.
   1.1.4. In addition to AM Ops and ATC services outlined in this instruction, the 100 Air
   Refueling Wing (ARW), 352 Special Operations Group (352 SOG) and attached units will
   abide by procedures outlined in the Letter of Agreement between RAFM, RAF Lakenheath
   (RAFL) and 352 SOG.
1.2. Authority for Imposing Airfield Restrictions.
   1.2.1. AM Ops may impose airfield restrictions as outlined in AFI 13-204v3. Tower and
   AM Ops may temporarily suspend runway or taxiway operations in the interest of safety;
   however, only the following personnel have the authority to open or close the runway, a
   taxiway or apron:
       1.2.1.1. 100 ARW/CC/CV or designated representatives.
       1.2.1.2. Airfield Manager or designated representative.
   1.2.2. Runway operations are automatically suspended, pending possible closure, when:
       1.2.2.1. An aircraft is disabled on or near the runway.
       1.2.2.2. An aircraft engages an aircraft arresting system (AAS).
       1.2.2.3. The first emergency vehicle enters the runway following a landing of an
       emergency aircraft. Runway operations may not need to be suspended for all emergencies
       but Tower must gain AM Ops concurrence in these instances.
   1.2.3. When runway or taxiway operations are suspended or closed, AM Ops must perform
   an airfield/Foreign Object Damage (FOD) check of the area before operations are resumed.
 8                                                 MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014


1.3. Runways. See Attachment 3.
     1.3.1. Runway 11/29: 9,206 X 200 feet. The runway elevation is 33’ MSL. The first 500’ of
     each end is grooved concrete and the remainder is a porous friction asphalt surface. The
     runway is marked 146’wide (white side stripe to white side stripe) but is weight bearing the
     full width of 200’.
     1.3.2. No aircraft will execute 180-degree turns on the asphalt portion of the runway.
     1.3.3. To the maximum extent possible, all aircraft will enter and exit the runway via
     Taxiway Alpha, Bravo and Echo. Any aircraft turning on/off runway at Taxiway Charlie or
     Delta must use only appropriate taxi lines in order to minimize the angle of turns on the
     asphalt.
        1.3.3.1. Aircraft parking on HS 65 may enter/exit at Taxiway Charlie South.
        1.3.3.2. The Tower Watch Supervisor can approve the use of Taxiway Charlie North to
        enter/exit the runway as operational needs dictate.
        1.3.3.3. AM Ops (when operational needs dictate) is the approving authority for using
        Taxiway Delta North to enter/exit the runway when the temperature exceeds 29 degrees
        Celsius.
            1.3.3.3.1. To mitigate the necessity to use Taxiway Delta North, the following steps
            shall be followed:
                1.3.3.3.1.1. Aircraft larger than a C-130 (wingspan of 132.6) landing Runway 29
                are to exit at the end of the runway onto Taxiway Alpha when aircraft are parked
                on Charlie North .
                1.3.3.3.1.2. If a heavy aircraft advises the turn cannot be made, Tower will
                instruct the aircraft to make a 180-degree turn in the overrun. The aircraft will
                then exit via a left turn on Taxiway Alpha, decreasing the turn angle and chances
                of the aircraft leaving the paved surface.
                1.3.3.3.1.3. If still unable to execute the turn at Taxiway Alpha, aircraft will be
                instructed to exit the runway via Taxiway Delta North.
        1.3.3.4. When weather conditions exceed 29 degrees Celsius, AM Ops will implement
        additional restrictions to operations via Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), per the Runway
        Surface Problems checklist.
     1.3.4. Overruns/Underruns are 1,000’ long at each end of the runway and are concrete. They
     have the same weight bearing capacity as the runway.
     1.3.5. Underruns are available for departures. Overruns do not meet departure clearance
     criteria and cannot be used in any calculations as additional runway available for takeoff.
     For planning purposes, when using the underrun for a departure, there is 9,806’ of runway
     available from the tip of the second chevron (counted from the approach end).
1.4. Taxiways.
     1.4.1. Taxiway Alpha and Bravo are 73.5’ wide at their narrowest points. Taxiways Charlie
     (North and South) and Delta North are 150’ wide. Taxiway Delta South is 50’ wide.
     Taxiway Echo is 75’ wide. Hammerhead dimensions are as follows:
MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014                                                                 9


      1.4.1.1. Taxiway Alpha Northwest Hammerhead: 470’ long, 205’ wide.
      1.4.1.2. Taxiway Bravo Southwest Hammerhead: 213’ long, 260’ wide.
      1.4.1.3. Taxiway Alpha Northeast Hammerhead: 377’ long, 298’ wide.
      1.4.1.4. Taxiway Bravo Southeast Hammerhead: 297’ long, 266’ wide.
   1.4.2. Use of taxiways for takeoffs and landings by fixed wing aircraft is not authorized.
   Use during real-world emergencies or contingency operations must be approved by 100
   OG/CC. Rotary wing/ Tilt-rotor aircraft may use taxiways for departures and landings.
   1.4.3. Taxiway Delta South is a tactical transport taxi-track and is restricted to AFSOC C-
   130 operations only. EXCEPTION: Transient C-130 aircraft are authorized with approval
   from 352 SOMXS/CC or MXM for maintenance purposes.
   1.4.4. Taxiway Charlie North is a fighter and tactical transport taxi-track. The taxi line on
   the northern portion of the taxiway is 25’ from the eastern edge of pavement. When aircraft
   are parked on Taxiway Charlie North, the taxiway is closed to aircraft larger than a C-130.
   When aircraft are not present, any aircraft may taxi, however, aircraft requiring more than a
   50’ wide taxiway will not use the northern taxi line (25’ from edge).
   1.4.5. Use of the Southwest Hammerhead must be prior coordinated with Tower due to close
   proximity to west perimeter road. When an aircraft will use the hammerhead to hold prior to
   departure, the aircraft must advise Tower so they can activate the west end perimeter road
   traffic lights to ensure vehicles do not violate jet blast safety requirements. Since use will
   restrict traffic on perimeter road, aircraft use must be mission essential and only for a limited
   timeframe.
1.5. Rotary wing/ Tilt-rotor Helicopter Operating Areas.
   1.5.1. Pad Alpha is located on the Northwest Hammerhead at the approach end of Runway
   11.
   1.5.2. Pad Charlie is located north of the runway on Taxiway Charlie between Hardstand 51
   and the runway hold line.
   1.5.3. Pad Delta is located on Taxiway Delta, north of the intersection of Taxiway Alpha and
   Delta and south of the Air Mobility Command (AMC) ramp.
   1.5.4. These areas will be used whenever possible; however, Tower may approve departures
   and landings for helicopters/tilt-rotor at any point on the airfield. See Attachment 3.
   1.5.5. Per RAF/Ministry of Defence (MOD) explosive safety restrictions, helicopters/tilt-
   rotor will not overfly the munitions storage/maintenance facilities on the airfield (Buildings
   1376, 1377, 1378 and 1381).
1.6. Runway Selection Procedures.
   1.6.1. Runway 29 is the primary instrument and calm wind runway. Runway 29 will be used
   when the wind speed is less than five knots, unless using Runway 11 aligns RAFM with the
   prevailing traffic flow at RAFL for operational efficiency and safety.
   1.6.2. Tower Watch Supervisor (WS) selects the runway in use, and may modify the
   selection for aircraft training requirements and ATCALS status. Any aircraft whose

   1.9.11. Clean water rinse (CWR) activities can be conducted on Hardstands 29, 31-35 and
   37.
      1.9.11.1. Due to increased oil water separator inspections, maintenance and sampling for
      hardstands supporting CWR activities and to eliminate operational costs and hardstand
      down times, the primary CWR location will be on hardstand 34. All rinses shall not
      exceed 4 hours to limit time on the high-risk hardstands. Use of any other location
      requires prior coordination with the primary user and AM Ops. Utilization of this
      hardstand must be prior coordinated with AM Ops and Security Forces Squadron (SFS)
      during Force Protection Condition (FPCON) Bravo or higher.
      1.9.11.2. Water used for the CWR cannot contain detergent, degreaser or chemical
      additives.
1.10. Restricted-Use (High-Risk) Hardstands.
   1.10.1. Due to close proximity to the perimeter fence, the 100 ARW/CC has designated
   Hardstands 5, 8, 18, 19, 34 and 37 as High-Risk Hardstands.
   1.10.2. Use of hardstands 5, 8, 18 and 19 are necessary to support the daily flying mission.
   Utilization of these hardstands are only restricted during FPCON Charlie or Delta.
   1.10.3. To utilize a High-Risk Hardstand, the requesting agency will contact AM Ops 72
   hours prior and provide justification for the request. AM Ops will then coordinate with 100
   SFS/S-5. If both agencies concur, AM Ops will initiate an e-SSS to request 100 ARW/CC
   approval. Once the 100 ARW/CC approves, AM Ops will advise the requesting agency.

   congestion by automating the repetitive transmission of essential but routine information.
   1.17.2. ATIS is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
   1.17.3. Pilots will use the ATIS to the maximum extent possible and report the received
   ATIS code to Tower upon initial contact to verify receipt of most current information.
1.18. Forward Area Refueling Point (FARP) and Hot Refueling (HR). (See Attachment 4)
   1.18.1. FARP operations involve aircraft to aircraft refueling. HR operations involve truck
   to aircraft refueling.
       1.18.1.1. The southeast Hammerhead is the primary FARP/HR area. Hardstand 65 is the
       alternate location when the southeast hammerhead is not available. Transient C-5 aircraft
       and other aircraft carrying explosive cargo have priority when Hardstand 65 is requested.
       When using Hardstand 65 or the southeast hammerhead for hot refueling operations, the
       adjacent taxiways will be restricted to participating aircraft only.
          1.18.1.1.1. When utilizing the Southeast Hammerhead, 352 SOG FARP operations
          require runway “Operations Suspended” for approximately two hours or the duration
          of the operation.
          1.18.1.1.2. 352 SOG will coordinate all FARP/HR operations with 100 MOF/MOC,
          SFS, FD and Fuels. Once coordination is complete, send coordinated request at least
          72 hours in advance to the Flight Commander, Airfield Operations (100 OSS/OSA)
          100oss.osav3@mildenhall.af.mil for final approval. AM Ops will then issue the
          applicable NOTAM(s).
          1.18.1.1.3. 352 SOG CV-22 on call hot refuel will be coordinated 24 hours in
          advance. Hot refuel will be available on call with 1 hour notice during the
          coordinated time period. Scheduling coordination will be with 100 MOF/MOC, SFS,
          FD and Fuels. 352 SOG will notify AM Ops and Tower at least 30 minutes prior to
          commencing CV-22 on call hot refuel operations. Taxiway Charlie South or Taxiway
          Bravo East (as scheduled/coordinated) operations are suspended when hot refueling
          begins.

      begin and terminate. AM Ops shall notify the Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC)
      when FARP operations begin and terminate.
      1.18.1.3. When using the Southeast Hammerhead for C-130 to C-130 FARP operations,
      Tower will activate the east perimeter road light just prior to the operation and de-
      activate when the operation is complete only when the receiving aircraft is closest to the
      perimeter road
      1.18.1.4. In the event of an emergency, aircrew shall broadcast "TAXI, TAXI, TAXI"
      over Tower UHF frequency and aircraft shall taxi out of the area. If aircrews must egress
      they shall broadcast, “EGRESS, EGRESS, EGRESS”. Tower shall implement ground
      emergency (GE) procedures.
      1.18.1.5. In the event of a fuel spill, depending on its classification, FARP/HR operations
      shall be terminated. Tower shall activate the Primary Crash Alert System (PCAS) and
      initiate GE procedures.
1.19. Drag Chutes.
   1.19.1. Due to the small number of drag chute-carrying aircraft transiting RAFM, no drag
   chute areas are designated.
   1.19.2. If aircraft is unable to carry their deployed drag chute to parking, Tower will
   coordinate with aircrew to determine the best location to jettison the chute. Tower will prior
   coordinate with TA, who will standby for aircraft arrival and retrieve the chute. Tower will
   coordinate with AM Ops if TA is unavailable. Runway ops will be suspended for AM Ops to
   conduct a runway FOD check after jettison of drag chute.
1.20. Aircraft Engine Run and Taxi Checks.
   1.20.1. All aircraft must contact Tower on the Ground Control Frequency or Ground Net
   prior to starting engines.
   1.20.2. All maintenance engine run or taxi check requests must be coordinated through
   MOC and then requested through Tower for approval prior to starting engines.
      1.20.2.1. For engine runs, 100 MOF/MOC will provide Tower with aircraft tail number,
      location, number of engines, power settings and duration.
      1.20.2.2. For taxi checks, 100 MOF/MOC will provide Tower with aircraft tail number,
      location and route of taxi.
      1.20.2.3. Requesting unit or units must obtain a quiet hour waiver prior to coordinating
      any maintenance engine runs or taxi checks that will occur or extend into published quiet
      hours. 100 MOF/MOC or CP will notify Tower of all approved quiet hour waivers.
      NOTE: The 100 ARW/CC has delegated approval of quiet hour waivers for maintenance
      engine runs to 100 MXG/CC/CD. The 100 MOF/MOC must report any approved engine
      run waivers to CP.
      1.20.2.4. Continuous two-way radio contact with Tower is required for safety advisories,
      aircraft proximity warnings and additional instructions. Tower shall notify the applicable
      MOC of lost communications with aircraft.

     1.20.2.5. In the event Tower is closed, the applicable MOC is the approving authority for
     maintenance engine runs or taxi checks. Maintenance run or taxi check crews must
     maintain direct radio contact with the approving MOC. Should an emergency arise,
     MOC will contact the FD and CP to initiate emergency response.
  1.20.3. Idle runs may be conducted on any hardstand with the following exceptions:
     1.20.3.1. Hardstands 5B, 12 (facing west), 34, 37: No engine operations due to close
     proximity to buildings, perimeter road and ILS antennas.
     1.20.3.2. Hardstand 27 is only authorized for engine start and immediate taxi.
     Maintenance idle runs or trouble shooting are not authorized due to fume problems in
     buildings behind hardstand.
  1.20.4. Above-Idle Engine Runs.
     1.20.4.1. Exhaust blast of jet engines can be hazardous to equipment and particularly
     hazardous to personnel. Maintenance personnel and aircrews performing above idle
     engine runs must ensure personnel, vehicles, and aircraft do not pass through hazardous
     jet blast areas as defined by applicable aircraft TO. A ground or flight crew member will
     be stationed to the side of the engine being operated to warn personnel and traffic to
     remain clear for a minimum distance of 200’ or depending on the type of aircraft
     involved, the distance in which jet blast dissipates to less than 35 MPH and not endanger
     personnel.
     1.20.4.2. Above-idle engine runs may be conducted on:
         1.20.4.2.1. Hardstands 18, 20, 22, 24, 58-62, and 65. When the acceptable level of
         explosives in the MSA are exceeded a NOTAM will be published prohibiting the use
         of hardstand 65. HS 65 can still be used for aircraft carrying hazardous cargo.
         1.20.4.2.2. Hardstands 43-45 may be used for above-idle runs if Hardstand 65 is not
         available. Use is dependent on where the aircraft is parked, what direction the aircraft
         is facing, proximity of other aircraft and what power settings are required. Aircraft
         Maintenance Squadron (AMXS) Production Supervisor must prior coordinate all
         above-idle runs with AM Ops and must ensure jet blast safety requirements in are
         complied with.
         1.20.4.2.3. Only AFSOC aircraft may use Taxiway Delta South, with aircraft
         positioned into the wind.
     1.20.4.3. Helicopters/tilt-rotor are authorized engine runs with full operating rotor RPM
     on any spot. NOTE: CV-22 start-up and shutdown will only occur on designated
     concrete locations.
     1.20.4.4. Other areas of the airfield may be used for engine runs to meet special mission
     needs. All requests to use an area other than those published in this instruction require
     prior coordination and approval by AM Ops. Any area used must meet standoff
     requirements listed in AFCESA Engineering Technical Letter 01-5, Jet Engine Thrust
     Standoff Requirements for Airfield Asphalt Edge Pavements.

      coordination and approval from Tower. Aircraft conducting hover checks on Alpha Pad
      will be ready to cease checks and land at Tower’s discretion because of landing traffic on
      final for Runway 11. Tower will advise when inbound traffic is on a 3 mile final.
      PHRASEOLOGY – “(ACID), GO FLAT PITCH, (TYPE AC) 3 MILE FINAL RUNWAY 11.”
1.21. Engines Running Crew Changes (ERCC).
   1.21.1. 351 ARS and 95 RS aircraft may utilize Taxiway Delta North between the AMC
   ramp and Taxiway Alpha to conduct ERCCs.
   1.21.2. Unless otherwise directed by Tower, aircraft can expect to turn off at the end of the
   runway and taxi to Delta North via Taxiway Alpha. Aircraft will park facing North if
   Runway 29 is in use and South if Runway 11 is in use. Aircraft intending to ERCC must
   advise Tower prior to landing.
   1.21.3. The AFM or designated representative will determine an alternate location if
   operational needs prevent the ERCC from taking place at the primary location. The alternate
   location will be based on current airfield conditions and mission impact.
1.22. Aircraft Towing.
   1.22.1. All tow requests must be first coordinated through applicable MOC. MOC shall
   notify Tower of authorized tows with aircraft tail number, location and destination. The tow
   team supervisor will establish and maintain two-way communications with the Tower on
   Ground Control frequency or the Ground Net at all times. Prior to any aircraft movement,
   the tow team supervisor must request/obtain tow approval from Tower. All aircraft
   movement must be approved by Tower prior to any tow operation.
   1.22.2. Any tow operation across the runway must follow CMA procedures. The crossing is
   considered complete when the entire aircraft in tow and any accompanying vehicles are past
   the hold line.
   1.22.3. When the Tower is closed:
      1.22.3.1. CMA procedures do not apply. Prior to opening for operations, AM Ops will
      verify the CMA is sterilized. NOTE: Tower closure is not to be confused with
      suspension of runway operations and closures should be verified with AM Ops or CP.
      1.22.3.2. The applicable MOC is the approving authority for aircraft tows. Personnel
      conducting tows will be in direct contact with appropriate MOC on applicable radio
      frequency at all times. Should an emergency arise, MOC will contact FD and CP.
   1.22.4. White lines are painted on all hammerheads, hardstands, access roads to taxiways
   and the runway at a point on the surface that will, when adhered to, ensure aircraft wing-tip
   clearance. No equipment or parked aircraft shall be positioned past the white lines (toward
   the movement area, taxiway or runway) in order to protect the path of taxiing or towed
   aircraft.
1.23. Aircraft Taxiing Requirements/Routes/Restrictions.
   1.23.1. Aircraft Ground Operations.
   1.23.2. All taxi operations require Tower (Ground) approval. NOTE: Any aircraft
   performing a taxi check must first coordinate with AM Ops prior to any ground operation.

  AM Ops will then coordinate with Tower and provide all pertinent information concerning
  taxi check operation. No flight plan is required for any taxi check aircraft.
  1.23.3. White lines are painted on all hammerheads, hardstands, access roads to taxiways
  and the runway at a point on the surface that will, when adhered to, ensure aircraft wing-tip
  clearance. No equipment or parked aircraft shall be positioned past the white lines (toward
  the movement area, taxiway or runway) in order to protect the path of taxiing or towed
  aircraft.
  1.23.4. Tower visual blind spots: Taxiway Bravo and behind (southside) hangars 715, 711,
  772, 774 and 775.
  1.23.5. Taxiway Bravo between Delta South and Hardstand 31 (pinch point) is restricted to
  base-assigned aircraft only due to close proximity of perimeter road. (Attachment 5).
     1.23.5.1. During periods of restricted visibility of less than 1000 ft/300 meters, aircraft
     will not operate on this portion of Bravo without prior coordination and approval from
     the applicable maintenance production supervisor. If an aircraft taxis in this area, the
     applicable aircraft maintenance section must post personnel at both stop locations on
     south perimeter road to ensure vehicle and pedestrian traffic are stopped while the aircraft
     transits the area. NOTE: For both training and operational missions, aircrews will not
     taxi until the runway visual range (RVR) is reported at or above the RVR required for
     takeoff. For conversion purposes, RVR 1,000’ equates to 300 meters, and RVR 1,600’
     equates to 490 meters. All taxiing aircraft are required to have all external lights
     illuminated, except for blackout/NVD operations.
  1.23.6. Whenever an aircraft is parked on Taxiway Charlie North hardstands, do not taxi an
  aircraft with a wingspan greater than 133’ (larger than a C-130) unless specifically approved
  by AM Ops. KC-135 type aircraft cannot taxi through the area if any aircraft is parked on a
  Taxiway Charlie North.
  1.23.7. Tower will not authorize taxi operations for aircraft with a wingspan greater than
  150’ (C-5, KC-10, C-17 and B-747 types) on Taxiway Bravo between the Southeast
  Hammerhead and Taxiway Charlie South. Exceptions for special events, wing-walker
  assisted (KC-10 and C-17 types only) and towing operations must be approved by AM Ops.
  Heavy aircraft parking on Hardstand 65 may need to back-taxi on the runway.
  1.23.8. KC-10 aircraft cannot make turns greater than 90 degrees entering or leaving parking
  (due to the narrow width of the taxiways) except on Hardstands 43-45 and 65.
  1.23.9. KC-10 aircraft assigned parking on Hardstands 3-8, 10-12 and 14-18 must be taxied
  to ensure the aircraft enter those hardstands with the unloading door side of the aircraft
  towards the main taxiway. KC-10 aircraft may need to back-taxi on the runway or make a
  180-degree turn on a hammerhead or ramp area to achieve the proper orientation.
  1.23.10. KC-10 aircraft may also need to back-taxi or make a 180-degree turn on a
  hammerhead or ramp area to get to the active runway.
  1.23.11. When visibility is less than (RVR 1000’) 300 meters, all aircraft must follow an
  escort vehicle to ensure uncontrolled vehicles and pedestrians are not in the taxi path.
  Transient aircraft may request an escort vehicle through the CP or Tower, who will request a
  follow-me vehicle from TA.
 20                                             MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014


   1.23.12. Heavy jets (e.g. C-5, B-747) should avoid using outboard engines for thrust to the
   maximum extent possible to minimize Foreign Object Damage (FOD).
   1.23.13. CV-22 aircraft shall not hold in areas that are not concrete, unless tower (with
   AMOPS approval) directs otherwise.
   1.23.14. All aircraft that request departure from the Runway 29 Underrun shall taxi via
   Taxiway Echo to the maximum extent possible. 180 degree turns in the Runway 29
   Underrun shall be limited as a last resort in an effort to reduce stress on the pavement and
   aircraft.
1.24. Airfield Sweeper Operations.
   1.24.1. CES will ensure an airfield sweeper is scheduled to support wing flying activities.
   Outside of duty hours, a stand-by sweeper must be available for mission essential operations.
   AM Ops will contact FD when the stand-by sweeper is required.
   1.24.2. All airfield sweeping requests will be called into AM Ops. Requests for a sweeper
   should be limited to items/areas too large to be readily picked-up by hand. AM Ops will
   prioritize multiple requests based on aircraft operations and relay to the sweeper. Sweeper
   will advise AM Ops when a request is complete.
   1.24.3. The goal of the sweeper schedule is to break the airfield down into daily increments
   to ensure the entire airfield is maintained (checked and swept as required) each work week.
   If, for example, Monday is a holiday, the Monday areas will be completed on Tuesday along
   with those daily areas. Sweeper will notify AM Ops when daily requirements are complete.
       1.24.3.1. Monday. Taxiway Alpha, open hardstands and airfield access points.
       1.24.3.2. Tuesday. Taxiway Bravo, open hardstands and airfield access points.

1.25. Airfield Snow Removal Operations. Operations will be IAW 100 ARW PLAN 32-96,
Snow and Ice Control Plan. All requests for snow removal on the airfield will be passed to AM
Ops for prioritization based on flying activities. Care must be used for snow removal operations
in the vicinity of NAVAIDs and the aircraft arresting systems to ensure proper system
operability.
1.26. Airfield Mowing Operations.
   1.26.1. Airfield mowing will be accomplished IAW the contracted statement of work.
   Mowers must advise AM Ops of daily areas intended to be mowed and when operations for
   the day are complete. Mowers must comply with CMA procedures per this instruction.
   1.26.2. Airfield grass height management will comply with 100 ARW PLAN 91-212,
   Airfield Bird Control.
MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014                                                               21


      1.26.2.1. While the long grass program is the goal, attention will be paid to ensure grass
      height does not obstruct view of any airfield lighting or signs. To facilitate this, areas
      directly around the lights and signs (i.e., 10 foot circle) will be maintained at a height of
      4-6 inches IAW the Landscape Management Contract.
1.27. Runway Surface Condition (RSC) and Runway Condition Reading (RCR).
   1.27.1. RSC and RCR will be determined and reported IAW AFI 13-204v3, chapter 18. A
   chart of RCR values can be found in the Flight Information Handbook.
   1.27.2. The runway consists of two significantly different friction characteristics, concrete
   and porous friction asphalt. Separate RSC and RCR will be reported for each surface.
   1.27.3. When runway is wet or slush is on the runway and ice or snow is not present, an
   RCR will not be reported.
   1.27.4. RSC and RCR will be reported to Tower, Base Weather Station, CP and RAF
   Lakenheath (RAFL) RAPCON. When reporting an RCR, AM Ops will additionally provide
   Tower with applicable ICAO braking action (GOOD, FAIR, POOR or NIL).
   1.27.5. When RSC is anything other than dry, AM Ops will issue a safety NOTAM.
1.28. Airfield Inspections and Checks. AM Ops shall perform all airfield inspections and
checks IAW AFI 13-204v3, Chapter 17 and AMOI 13-204 Airfield Management.
1.29. Noise Abatement Procedures.
   1.29.1. Aircraft will avoid flying over Mildenhall Town, Barton Mills (to include the
   corridor over the Lark River between Mildenhall and Barton Mills), Worlington,
   Tuddenham, Red Lodge, Beck Row, Isleham, Newmarket, West Row, Ely and other towns
   and villages in the local area below 2,000’ above ground level (AGL) unless safety of flight
   is a factor.
   1.29.2. Aircraft departing Runway 29 or making approaches to Runway 11 will avoid flying
   over Ely and Ely Cathedral on the Mildenhall TACAN 286 radial/8.6 DME below 2,000’
   AGL unless safety of flight is a factor. Aircraft on radar vectors should expect to be
   restricted by Lakenheath RAPCON until clear of area.
   1.29.3. Aircraft are not authorized unrestricted climbs.
1.30. Protection of Precision Approach Critical Areas.
   1.30.1. Tower will protect ILS critical areas depicted in Attachment 6, IAW AFI 13-204v3,
   Chapter 7. Although the ILS critical areas are not considered part of the CMA, vehicles shall
   not loiter in these areas unless performing mission essential activities. If personnel must
   perform prolonged duties within the critical area, they must follow CMA access procedures.
   1.30.2. ILS critical areas are identified by instrument hold lines (as depicted on the Airfield
   Diagram). When instructed by Tower to hold short of an instrument critical area, aircraft
   will not taxi and vehicles will not drive past instrument hold lines to preclude interference
   with ILS transmitters.
      1.30.2.1. Localizer Critical Areas:
 22                                               MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014


          1.30.2.1.1. When the reported ceiling is less than 800 feet and/or the visibility is less
          than 2 miles, restrict all aircraft and vehicle operations in the localizer critical area.
          Do not permit vehicles or aircraft to transit the localizer critical area when an aircraft
          on the ILS approach is inside the Final Approach Fix (FAF). Exception: A preceding
          aircraft, approaching the same runway or another runway, may pass through the area
          while landing, departing, or exiting the runway; do not allow aircraft to stop within
          the critical area.
          1.30.2.1.2. When the reported ceiling is less than 200’ or visibility is less than ½ mile
          (RVR 2000), do not authorize vehicle or aircraft operations in or over the area when
          an arriving aircraft is inside 1 NM final approach.
      1.30.2.2. Glideslope Critical Areas:
          1.30.2.2.1. When the reported ceiling is less than 800 feet and/or visibility less than 2
          miles, restrict all aircraft and vehicles. Do not permit aircraft or vehicles to
          taxi/proceed beyond the instrument hold line when an aircraft executing an ILS
          approach is inside the FAF.
      1.30.2.3. Although not inside of the critical area, Hardstand 35 is located past the
      instrument hold line on taxiway Bravo. Aircraft parked on Hardstand 35 will be
      restricted from taxiing to Runway 11 until they are ready for departure when the ILS
      critical area is protected.
1.31. Perimeter Road Traffic Lights.
   1.31.1. Tower controls the perimeter road traffic lights on the east and west ends of the
   airfield to prevent vehicles from entering the ILS Critical Area and protect vehicles from jet
   blast. It takes approximately 5 minutes for vehicle traffic to exit the area. Tower will activate
   the appropriate perimeter road lights for the following situations:
      1.31.1.1. Underrun departure use is as follows to ensure jet blast safety.
          1.31.1.1.1. Runway 29: Activate light for aircraft larger than KC-135.
          1.31.1.1.2. Runway 11: Activate light for all departures.
      1.31.1.2. An aircraft is flying an ILS approach when the weather conditions are less than
      reported ceiling 800’ and/or the visibility is less than 2 miles. The approach-end
      perimeter road light shall be turned on before the arriving aircraft reaches 15 miles to
      allow vehicles time to vacate the area.
      1.31.1.3. Both ends when an emergency aircraft is 15 miles on IFR final or as soon as
      practical if the emergency aircraft is in the VFR pattern until touchdown and/or no longer
      poses a threat to the area.
      1.31.1.4. The east end perimeter road when aircraft are conducting FARP/HR operations
      in the Southeast Hammerhead IAW paragraph 1.1.18.
      1.31.1.5. The west end perimeter road when aircraft hold in the Southwest Hammerhead
      in a position that directs jet blast across west end perimeter road.
      1.31.1.6. The controller deems it necessary in the interest of safety.
MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014                                                                23


       1.31.1.7. The perimeter road traffic lights will not be activated for the following
       situations:
       1.31.1.8. VFR operations to either runway.
   1.31.2. The perimeter road lights are normally green. Vehicle operators must remain highly
   alert and avoid driving on perimeter road behind departing aircraft using the underrun.
   1.31.3. Whenever Tower cannot turn the lights to red (malfunction, loss of control, etc.),
   Tower will immediately notify AM Ops of the outage. AM Ops will contact CE Service Call
   Desk for a priority work request.
       1.31.3.1. If both the east and west ends of perimeter road are open, AM Ops will
       coordinate with CES and SFS to close and block the affected end of perimeter road until
       the lights return to service.
       1.31.3.2. If only one end needs to be blocked, Tower will notify AM Ops 20 minutes
       prior to any aircraft operation that will require the road to be blocked in lieu of using the
       lights.
          1.31.3.2.1. AM Ops will notify the BDOC and request a patrol stand-by at the
          applicable runway end, north perimeter road traffic light location.
          1.31.3.2.2. AM Ops will respond to the applicable runway end south perimeter road
          traffic light location.
          1.31.3.2.3. Five minutes prior to aircraft operation, Tower will advise AM Ops and
          BDOC to block traffic. Immediately after aircraft operation is complete, Tower will
          advise AM Ops and BDOC to resume normal operations.
          1.31.3.2.4. SFS can only support immediate blocking of the perimeter road when the
          perimeter lights are out of service and should only be used for a limited period of time
          or the lights are back in service. If the lights will be out of service for any extended
          period of time, or multiple requests will be made due to operations, weather, etc ...,
          100 OSS/OSA will then coordinate with 100 OG/CC to request augmentation support
          from CES to block the road and curtailment of operations to limit the number the
          closures required (e.g., restricting multiple IFR approaches when the critical area has
          to be protected).
1.32. Airfield Restricted Areas. Restricted areas and entry control procedures are described in
100 ARW Integrated Defense Plan (accessed only via SIPRNET).
1.33. Generator Procedures for Building 669.
   1.33.1. The generator for Bldg 669 (Tower/AM Ops/FD) will normally be run or tested on
   the 3rd Wednesday of each month at 1400L (local) for one hour.
       1.33.1.1. CES Power Production will advise Bldg 669 occupants at least 10 minutes prior
       to the power switch over and again prior to returning to commercial power once test is
       complete.
   1.33.2. Should commercial power fail, and the generator not auto-start between the hours of
   0700-2300L, ATC personnel will start the generator. Should commercial power fail between
   the hours of 2300-0700L, FD will start the generator.

2.1. Local Flying Area/Designation of Airspace.

Figure 2.1. CMATZ




   2.1.1. Mildenhall Aerodrome Traffic Zone (ATZ): RAFM Tower is delegated the
   Mildenhall ATZ. The ATZ radius is 2.5 nautical miles (NM) from the midpoint of the
   runway and extends vertically from the aerodrome surface to 2,000’ AGL. Aircraft shall not
   takeoff, land or fly within the ATZ without permission from Tower. ATZ procedures apply
   to both military and civilian aircraft per the British Manual of Air Traffic Management
   MAA 3000, Military Flying Regulations, Section 201.125 Aerodrome Traffic Zones (ATZs).
   2.1.2. Mildenhall’s Military ATZ (MATZ): located within the Lakenheath/Mildenhall
   Combined (MATZ). As per the MAA 3000, the Mildenhall MATZ has been established to
   provide a volume of airspace within which increased protection may be given to aircraft in
   the critical stages of circuit, approach and climb-out. A MATZ acquires the status of the
   airspace classification within which it lies; however, additional mandatory ATC requirements
   are invariably specified for military pilots. In the airspace outside the ATZ, observation of
   MATZ procedures is not compulsory for civil pilots.
MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014                                                         25


     2.1.2.1. Mildenhall MATZ dimensions are as follows:
         2.1.2.1.1. The airspace within 5 NM radius of the midpoint of the longest runway,
         from the surface to 3000ft above aerodrome level.
         2.1.2.1.2. The MATZ has two stubs extending 10 NM from the end of each runway
         with a width of 2 NM north and 5 NM south of extended centerlines. The stubs
         extend vertically from 1,000-3,000’ AGL.
  2.1.3. CMATZ: consists of the Lakenheath MATZ, Mildenhall MATZ and the extensions to
  each.
  2.1.4. CAUTION: Civil aircraft may fly through the CMATZ and MATZ, but not the ATZ,
  without the knowledge or consent of the Mildenhall or Lakenheath Controller. Because of
  the close proximity of various airfields in the CMATZ, aircrews should make every effort to
  see and avoid and remain cognizant of other traffic, especially when Lakenheath is using
  Runway 24 and Mildenhall is using Runway 29.

                                    VFR PROCEDURES

3.1. VFR Training Areas:
   3.1.1. RAFM does not have predetermined VFR Training Areas.
3.2. VFR Weather Minima.
   3.2.1. Weather minimums for VFR practice approaches are:
   3.2.2. Ceiling of 500’ or more above the pattern altitude to be flown and 5000 meter
   visibility.
   3.2.3. Remain clear of clouds, in sight of the ground surface for helicopter/tilt-rotor
   operations.
3.3. VFR Traffic Patterns.
   3.3.1. Local VFR traffic patterns and altitudes are depicted in Attachment 7. Left-hand
   traffic will be standard for Runway 29. Right-hand traffic will be standard for Runway 11.
   ATC may direct other traffic patterns as necessary due to traffic or airspace restrictions.
   Pattern altitudes are:
      3.3.1.1. Radar traffic pattern – 3,000’MSL.
      3.3.1.2. Overhead pattern – 1,800’ MSL (RAFL RAPCON provides vectors to initial
      upon pilot request). In order to protect the 360 overhead pattern, Tower shall direct
      departing aircraft to cross departure end of runway at or below 1,300’ MSL. Tower will
      advise the appropriate RAFL RAPCON position of any altitude restrictions assigned to
      IFR departure aircraft.
          3.3.1.2.1. Approach end of the runway (first 3000’) is the standard overhead pattern
          break point.
          3.3.1.2.2. The overhead pattern will be flown at 1,800’MSL until turning base.
          Aircraft wishing to descend below 1,800’ MSL following the break turn must request
          and receive approval from Tower.
      3.3.1.3. Conventional rectangular pattern: 1,200’ MSL.
      3.3.1.4. Light aircraft/helicopter traffic pattern: 700’ MSL.
      3.3.1.5. Low closed pattern: 600’ MSL.
          3.3.1.5.1. Low closed pattern will only be used by RAFM assigned aircraft to satisfy
          training requirements.
3.4. VFR Pattern Restrictions. (See Attachment 7)
   3.4.1. Traffic permitting, Tower may approve closed traffic patterns. In the VFR traffic
   pattern, on Runway 11, make crosswind turn at 1.8 DME to avoid the town of Mildenhall.
   3.4.2. On Runway 29, if aircraft performance permits, make crosswind turn when clear of
   the field boundary to be inside the town of Isleham. If aircraft performance does not permit
MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014                                                            27


   the above, do not turn crosswind until 3.0 DME and fly to the outside of Isleham. Other
   restrictions are:
   3.4.3. The 3 DME restriction on Runway 29 is not applicable to helicopters/tilt-rotors.
   3.4.4. The VFR traffic pattern may be restricted when RAFL is operating on Runway 06.
   3.4.5. Helicopters/tilt-rotors may fly a shortened VFR traffic pattern within one mile of the
   runway.

   3.5.1. Departures: These procedures are for the exclusive use of 352 SOG aircraft. The
   stereo routes are flown at a maximum altitude of 1200 ft MSL while within the CMATZ,
   unless otherwise coordinated. MLD TWR will transfer departing aircraft to RAPCON prior
   to exiting CMATZ.
   3.5.1.1. MLD TWR, with RAPCON approval, may authorize use a specific departure route
   from MLD. RAPCON, with MLD TWR approval, may authorize use of a specific recovery
   routes to MLD. Radar service within the CMATZ will be provided IAW the Manual of
   Military Air Traffic Management (MMATM). NOTE: Due to the runway configuration at
   LKH and MLD, and required separation minima, RAPCON may disapprove MLD VFR
   departure/arrival routes and direct departing/arriving aircraft to Point RISBY as traffic
   dictates.
      3.5.1.2. Routes: There are four VFR departure routes; each named for the direction the
      aircraft will depart MLD; NORTHEAST, NORTHWEST, SOUTHEAST and
      SOUTHWEST. The NORTHEAST and NORTHWEST departures will not normally be
      approved during daytime hours or any night that the LKH traffic pattern has numerous
      departures/recoveries. In this case, the southern departures should be used.
          3.5.1.2.1. VFR NORTHWEST DEPARTURE RUNWAY 11: Fly runway heading
          until 3 DME, then turn right direct RED, direct CHETT. Maintain at or below 1200’
          MSL until crossing CHETT. Establish communication with RAPCON prior to
          departing the CMATZ.
          3.5.1.2.2. VFR NORTHWEST DEPARTURE RUNWAY 29: Fly runway heading

         MSL until crossing BARN. Establish communication with RAPCON prior to
         departing the CMATZ.
         3.5.1.2.5. VFR SOUTHEAST DEPARTURE RUNWAY 11: Fly runway heading
         until 3 DME, then turn right direct RISBY. Maintain at or below 1200’ MSL until
         crossing RISBY. Establish communication with RAPCON prior to departing the
         CMATZ.
         3.5.1.2.6. VFR SOUTHEAST DEPARTURE RUNWAY 29: Fly runway heading
         until 3 DME, then turn left direct RED, direct RISBY. Maintain at or below 1200’
         MSL until crossing RISBY. Establish communication with RAPCON prior to
         departing the CMATZ.
         3.5.1.2.7. VFR SOUTHWEST DEPARTURE RUNWAY 11: Fly runway heading
         until 3 DME, then turn right direct RED, direct FEN. Maintain at or below 1200’
         MSL until crossing FEN. Establish communication with RAPCON prior to departing
         the CMATZ.
         3.5.1.2.8. VFR SOUTHWEST DEPARTURE RUNWAY 29: Fly runway heading
         until 3 DME, then turn left direct FEN. Maintain at or below 1200’ MSL until
         crossing FEN. Establish communication with RAPCON prior to departing the
         CMATZ.
  3.5.2. Arrivals: There are four VFR arrival routes, each named for the direction the aircraft
  will arrive from; NORTHEAST, NORTHWEST, SOUTHEAST and SOUTHWEST. The
  NORTHEAST and NORTHWEST arrivals will not normally be approved during daytime
  hours or any night that LKH traffic pattern has numerous departures and/or recoveries. In
  these cases, the southern arrivals should be used. RAPCON will transfer arriving aircraft to
  MLD TWR prior to reaching 10 flying miles from the airport, or as coordinated.
     3.5.2.1. Contact RAPCON Approach Control at least 5 miles prior to any of the four
     entry points (CHETT, BARN, RISBY, and FEN), and advise of your intentions. If
     approved, the arriving aircraft would then flow through the appropriate entry point and
     proceed with recovery. PHRASEOLOGY - "(ACID) REQUEST NORTHWEST
     ARRIVAL."
     3.5.2.2. VFR Recovery: When approved for VFR arrival from any of the four entry
     points, cross that entry point at or below 1,200 ft MSL and proceed inbound, either to a
     straight-in or downwind south of MLD. Expect transfer to MLD TWR at the entry point
     or when advised by RAPCON Approach Control. MLD TWR may be required to alter
     actual aircraft track to properly sequence with other traffic flowing in and out of MLD.
  3.5.3. RAPCON will approve CV-22s operating at or below 500 ft to proceed on course to
  the maximum extent possible. However, it is recognized that when aircraft are arriving RWY
MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014                                                              29


   06, requests for a westerly heading may be temporarily delayed to maintain separation
   minimums from LKH traffic. RAPCON will approve on course as soon as possible.
   3.5.4. Special Procedures: Inadvertent weather penetration: Maintain 1,200 ft MSL (2,000 ft
   MSL if inbound CHETT) and advise RAPCON Approach Control of your intentions. Expect
   a climb to at least 2,000 ft MSL.
   3.5.5. Random Steep Recovery: Aircraft will begin 360 spiral random steep no lower than
   4,000ft AGL and remain within 3 NM of the field. C-130 type aircraft will advise Tower of
   intended approach direction. Tower will advise of any other airspace restrictions. C-130
   type aircraft will roll-out no closer than .25 NM from the runway of intended landing. C-135
   type aircraft will roll-out no lower than 1000ft for a base, downwind or short final leg and be
   stabilized 300ft and 1 NM from the approach end of the runway.
3.6. Simulated Flameout Patterns. Simulated flameout patterns are not authorized due to
airspace restrictions and the complexity caused by adjacent airports.
3.7. No Flap/Engine Out Patterns. Normal traffic will be flown with an extended downwind
leg. Pilots will advise the Tower, especially when their downwind leg will exceed 4 NMs from
the airport.
3.8. Helicopter/ Tilt-rotor Operations.
   3.8.1. There are two helicopter landing zones (HLZ) located on the airfield: Vandegeer
   (Vandy) and Foss.
       3.8.1.1. Vandy HLZ is a grassy area 353’ south of RAFM runway (Attachment 3).
          3.8.1.1.1. Operations in Vandy will be conducted a minimum of 200’ from the edge
          of the runway.
          3.8.1.1.2. Simultaneous non-352 SOG aircraft arrival or departure operations to the
          runway and Vandy are not authorized. Helicopters/tilt-rotor may be on the ground
          while operations are in progress to or from the runway.
          3.8.1.1.3. Helicopters/tilt-rotor must be prepared to land or vacate Vandy should
          Tower require the runway.
       3.8.1.2. Foss HLZ is a grassy area east of Delta Pad located between Taxiway Alpha and
       Delta and south of the AMC Ramp (Attachment 3).
          3.8.1.2.1. Simultaneous non-352 SOG aircraft arrival and departure operations to the
          runway and Foss are authorized.
          3.8.1.2.2. Helicopters/tilt-rotor will remain north of Delta Pad to meet distance
          requirements for simultaneous operations.
   3.8.2. HLZs on the airfield are not intended as the primary training areas; other training
   areas should be scheduled first. The operations planned at airfield HLZs include fast-rope,
   rope-ladder, hoist, air/land and helicopter coupled approaches. Any on/off-load of
   personal/equipment must be pre-announced to Tower.
   3.8.3. Helicopters/tilt-rotor may utilize the HLZs to conduct operations including NVD
   operations, provided weather requirements stipulated in paragraph 3.15.5 are met.

   3.8.4. Helicopters/tilt-rotor will maintain two-way communications with Tower and will not
   over fly aircraft in parking or on taxiways.
   3.8.5. Tower shall maintain final approval authority for Vandy and Foss operations based on
   traffic. Helicopters/tilt-rotor will notify Tower, stating type of operation and expected
   duration time, a minimum of 15 minutes prior to use. This notification ensures Tower can
   adjust operations in the ATZ to meet the needs of all aircraft.
   3.8.6. Tower will utilize the terms Vandy or Foss during coordination of all operations on
   the HLZs.
   3.8.7. Vandy and Foss are classified as a non-movement area for airfield operations
   purposes. Therefore, Tower will not issue landing/takeoff clearances to participating
   helicopters/tilt-rotor.
3.9. Autorotation Procedures.
   3.9.1. Auto rotations are normally flown to the runway between 500’ and 1,000’ AGL unless
   otherwise coordinated with Tower. As such, they will be worked into the normal VFR
   pattern and do not require termination upon arrival of additional aircraft.
   3.9.2. When a more favorable wind direction is deemed necessary, auto rotations may be
   flown to Taxiway Charlie South, with coordination and approval from Tower. Simultaneous
   runway and Charlie operations are not authorized so termination may be required if other
   aircraft are using the runway in use.
3.10. Unusual Maneuvers/Functional Check Flights (FCF) within Mildenhall’s Airspace.
   3.10.1. Unusual maneuvers are maneuvers not essential to the performance of flight or
   which violate Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). Unusual maneuvers include, but are not
   limited to, high speed passes, practice airfield attacks and aerial demonstrations. All unusual
   maneuvers and/or fixed wing FCF’s shall be coordinated with 100 OSS/OSA, and approved
   by 100 OG/CC, prior to the event to ensure no United Kingdom (UK) restrictions apply.
   NOTE: 352 SOG fixed wing assets must first coordinate through the 352 SOMXS and 352
   SOG/CC prior to coordination with 100 OSS/OSA.
   3.10.2. Tilt-rotor Functional Check Flights will be submitted along with the daily flying
   schedule. Tilt-rotor FCFs will either occur in the local pattern or in a block of airspace
   coordinated with RAPCON, typically the following area (from surface to FL080). For a
   visual depiction, see Attachment 9.

3.11. Paradrop Operations.
   3.11.1. Combat Controllers.
   3.11.1.1. 321st Special Tactics Squadron (STS) provide combat controllers as needed for
   352 SOG operations. The 321 STS/CC is responsible for ensuring the STS combat
   controllers are technically and medically qualified to control aircraft.
   3.11.2. The term Drop Zone Control Officer (DZCO) refers to 321 STS combat controllers,
   pararescuemen or other 352 SOG personnel who are trained to control aircraft at a drop zone
   IAW AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Procedures.
3.12. Parachute Drop Zone (DZ) Procedures.
   3.12.1. Reluctant DZ, Demonstration DZ and CCT DZ are depicted in Attachment 3.
      3.12.1.1. Reluctant DZ is located on the airfield encompassing the center of the runway
      and extending east to the western edge of HS 9 /10 and just west of Taxiway Delta. The
      dimensions are 4,860 feet long by 1,800 feet wide.
      3.12.1.2. Demonstration DZ is located on the airfield north of the runway extending east
      to HS 46 and west to the eastern side of hanger 539. The dimensions are 1,800 feet long
      by 1,230 feet wide.
      3.12.1.3. CCT DZ is a small circular area located in the grassy area north of the runway
      between Taxiway Delta North and the NW hammerhead. This DZ has a radius of 360
      feet.
   3.12.2. Airdrop Descriptions.
      3.12.2.1. Standard Air Drop Training Bundle (SATB) (Sand Bags). Flown between 130
      to 250 knots and between 150’to 3,000’ AGL, depending on type of drop simulated.
      3.12.2.2. High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) (Personnel).              Flown at 130 knots,
      between 3,033’ MSL (3000’ AGL) and FL 190 MSL.
      3.12.2.3. Static Line Personnel (PE). Flown at 130 knots, between 833’ MSL (800’
      AGL) and 3,033’ MSL (3000’ AGL).
   3.12.3. Weather Minima for all paradrop operations.
      3.12.3.1. Visibility 800 meters.
      3.12.3.2. Ceiling 300’ AGL.
   3.12.4. Coordination Requirements.
      3.12.4.1. 100 OG/CC is the final approval authority for all airfield restrictions associated
      with DZ operations. Once authorized, all DZ operations/activations will be complete and
      clear of the airfield by the restriction expiration time.
      3.12.4.2. All 352 SOG requests to utilize RAFM DZs will be forwarded to 352
      SOSS/A3O. 352 SOSS/A3O will initiate an electronic staff summary sheet for DZ
      activation no later than 1200L, Monday prior to the week of activity. Request will be
      submitted to 100 OSS/DO, 48 OSS/DO, 727 AMS/DO, 95 RS/DO, 100 ARW/CCT and
      100 ARW/SEW.
32                                              MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014


     3.12.4.3. Each agency will de-conflict appropriate flying schedules and provide
     concurrence/non-concurrence to 352 SOSS/A3O.        352 SOSS/A3O will forward
     concurrence to 100 OSS/DO no later than 4 days prior to scheduled activities. 100
     OSS/DO will coordinate with 100 OG/CC for final approval. Once approved, 100
     OSS/DO will advise 100 OSS/OSA of approved airfield restriction times.
     3.12.4.4. For operations above 3,000’ AGL (i.e., HALO), 352 SOSS/A3O will
     coordinate with London Airspace Utilization Section (AUS) for activation of an Airspace
     Coordination Notice (ACN) no later than 1 day prior to execution, although 7 days prior
     is desired. 352 SOSS/A3O will forward a copy of the ACN to 100 OSS/OSA
     organizational inbox.
     3.12.4.5. 352 SOG aircrews will contact RAFL RAPCON WS at 226-2476/3573 one
     hour prior to takeoff to confirm sortie details and ATC procedures.
  3.12.5. Airfield Restrictions:
     3.12.5.1. AM Ops will issue a NOTAM restricting the airfield to participating aircraft,
     for operations during the DZ window, all others can expect delays. AM Ops will
     additionally notify BDOC, 100 MOF/MOC, 352 SOG/MOC, FD and ARW/SEW.
     3.12.5.2. For personnel airdrops, aircraft will not have engines running or rotors turning
     during the restriction window. Tower will disapprove all requests for engine start
     beginning when the drop platform departs until the DZCO advises all jumpers are on the
     ground and accounted for. Aircraft with engines running must depart reserved airspace
     within 10 minutes following departure of the drop platform, or as soon as practicable as
     deemed necessary by Tower.
     3.12.5.3. Runway operations shall be suspended after any airdrop activates until AM Ops
     accomplishes a FOD check and declares runway operations resumed.
  3.12.6. Procedures/Responsibilities:
     3.12.6.1. Airdrop aircraft shall contact RAFL RAPCON for approval to fly in for the
     drop as coordinated in pre-coordination forums or as in the ACN. To the maximum
     extent possible, ATC should allow airdrop aircraft to use its own navigation to the
     airdrop to allow for time-on-target training.
     3.12.6.2. Run-ins to the DZ begin approximately 10 miles from the field. Heading
     depends on the selected DZ.
     3.12.6.3. If airdrop aircraft is conducting multiple airdrops, aircraft will racetrack for the
     next run-in to the south of the airfield only, following published noise abatement
     procedures listed in this instruction.
     3.12.6.4. Tower will observe and monitor airdrop operations and interrupt/cancel airdrop
     operations if it appears safety may be compromised. Aircraft shall remain under the
     control of Tower for separation purposes while maintaining radio contact with the DZCO
     until drop is complete. Aircraft will acknowledge and comply with Tower transmissions
     and instructions if airdrop is cancelled for safety considerations.
     3.12.6.5. Airdrop aircraft shall contact DZCO and Tower 2-5 minutes out from the drop.
     DZCO will approve or disapprove the drop clearance.
MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014                                                               33


      3.12.6.6. HALO drops will comply with the ACN. IAW the ACN, the CMATZ shall be
      sterilized 10 minutes prior to any jump activity and until all jumpers are on the ground
      and accounted for. Airdrop aircraft will squawk appropriate Mode 3 code.
   3.12.7. DZCO Responsibilities.
      3.12.7.1. The DZCO will contact Tower on UHF Ground Control frequency and request
      permission before entering the DZ, CMA, or proceeding onto/across the runway. DZCO
      will monitor the frequency during the entire operation.
      3.12.7.2. The DZCO will mark the DZ IAW AFI 13-217.
      3.12.7.3. DZCO will accomplish a check of the DZ, to include the runway and applicable
      taxiways, to ensure the DZ is clear of non-participating personnel/vehicles. DZCO will
      advise Tower when the check is complete and the DZ is safe.
      3.12.7.4. Tower will notify the DZCO if they observe non-participating
      personnel/vehicles enter the DZ. In this case, the DZCO is responsible for suspension or
      continuation of the airdrop. The DZCO will inform Tower of his decision to suspend or
      continue the airdrop.
      3.12.7.5. The DZCO will control no more than one operation at a time. An operation can
      be a formation or multiple aircraft performing the same function (all participating event
      aircraft). The DZCO will only control participating aircraft. If other aircraft must enter
      the pattern to land or takeoff, the DZCO will relinquish control of all aircraft to Tower.
      3.12.7.6. Upon completion of the drops, the DZCO will perform a parachute count and
      remove all equipment from the entire airfield. If a chute or bundle cannot be
      located/accounted for, the DZCO will immediately notify Tower.
      3.12.7.7. When ground conditions are wet, the DZCO will recover all airdrop related
      equipment with all terrain vehicles and trailers versus using vehicles that can rut the grass
      portions of the airfield.
      3.12.7.8. In the event of an emergency during the airfield closure for the airdrop
      activities, the DZCO will immediately terminate activates and depart the drop zone if
      directed by Tower.
3.13. Landing Zone Procedures.
   3.13.1. Typical profile is for the aircraft to initially fly a straight-in approach. Somewhere
   between 4 miles and 1 mile from touchdown, at an altitude between 500’ and 1,000’ AGL,
   the aircraft will normally start a descent to the landing zone and attempt to land the aircraft
   within the landing zone.
   3.13.2. STS or 352 SOG approved personnel may set up airfield marking pattern (AMP)
   lighting on the runway during scheduled training IAW AFI 13-217 but must remove the
   lighting for any other aircraft arrival.
3.14. Self-Contained Approaches (SCA).
   3.14.1. 352 SOG aircraft conduct approaches using self-contained, onboard navigation
   systems. This approach can be flown to a normal airfield marking/lighting runway, an overt
 34                                                MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014


   or blacked-out runway, or landing zone procedures, normally to a Time of Arrival (TOA) +/-
   30 seconds.
   3.14.2. Typically, the aircraft will maneuver to a 10 mile final and, between 1-3 NMs to
   touchdown, will begin a descent to land. This maneuver can also be initiated from the
   downwind leg (known as a turning SCA), where the aircraft will roll-out on short final at
   approximately 1/2 mile to touchdown.
3.15. Random Shallow Beam VFR Procedures
   3.15.1. Conducting tactical approaches is necessary training and must be balanced with host
   nation restrictions. Random Shallow Beam maneuvers are limited to 352d Special
   Operations Group aircraft. Aircrews are responsible for avoiding over flight of built-
   up/populated areas in Beck Row while executing these approaches at RAF Mildenhall.
   3.15.2. Unless otherwise coordinated with Tower, Random Shallow Beam approaches will
   normally transit from south to north of the airfield, then circle north of the field to a left base
   for Runway 11 or a right base for Runway 29. Prior to starting the procedure the aircraft will:
      3.15.2.1. Request Random Shallow Beam Approach to Tower by stating “REQUEST
      RANDOM SHALLOW BEAM APPROACH TO RUNWAY (11/29)”. If approved, Tower
      will state “(CALLSIGN), RANDOM SHALLOW BEAM APPROVED, REPORT
      (LEFT/RIGHT) BASE RUNWAY (11/29).” If unable to approve due to traffic or airspace
      restrictions, Tower will advise “UNABLE RANDOM SHALLOW BEAM, (STATE
      REASONS), SAY INTENTIONS”. Aircrews will not execute a Random Shallow Beam
      maneuver without Tower approval.
      3.15.2.2. For Random Shallow Beam approaches on the west end of the airfield, the
      aircraft will remain west of the ATC Tower unless otherwise coordinated.
      3.15.2.3. For Random Shallow Beam approaches on the east end of the airfield, the
      aircraft will remain east of the ATC Tower unless otherwise coordinated. NOTE: To
      avoid overflying the village school, aircraft should ideally cross the airfield between
      Hardstand 11 and Hardstand 12.
      3.15.2.4. The aircraft will remain at or above 500 ft AGL until reaching base turn.
   3.15.3. Tower will coordinate the use of the North Pattern with RAFL Approach and RAFL
   Tower prior to approving the Random Shallow Beam procedure.
3.16. Airfield Blackout/Night Vision Device (NVD) Operations.
   3.16.1. NVD procedures are outlined in this document; however, due to the nature and
   inherent risk of these operations, all NVD operations will be conducted at aircrews “own
   risk.”
   3.16.2. The following areas are authorized for blackout operations: Taxiway D, Taxiway A,
   Taxiway C, HS 65 and the four hammerheads. NVD takeoffs/landings shall be flown only to
   Runway 11/29 or approved helicopter/tilt-rotor operating location as found in this instruction.
   NOTE: IAW AFI 13-204v3, prior to the start of NVD operations, AM Ops will conduct an
   airfield check of the designated runway, taxi routes, and IR lighting configurations (if
   applicable). As a minimum, the Control Tower, Command Post, AFM and AOF/CC will be
   notified if NVD operations must be suspended due to airfield safety/hazards.
MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014                                                            35


  3.16.3. Scheduling procedures. All 352 SOG night missions are considered scheduled for
  NVD operations. Other flying organizations should schedule operations NLT 1 week prior to
  the event, if possible.
  3.16.4. Notification/coordination requirements. NVD operations are authorized for 352
  SOG operations, but all quite hour policies IAW USAFEI 11-201 will be followed.
  3.16.5. Weather requirements/Lunar illumination requirements.          NOTE:         Weather
  minimums for helicopters/tilt-rotor below are from the JSP 550 and UK Mil AIP.
     3.16.5.1. Ceiling: 500’ above traffic pattern altitude for fixed wing aircraft or 500’ for
     helicopters/tilt-rotor.
     3.16.5.2. Visibility: 5,000 meters for fixed wing aircraft or 3,200 meters for
     helicopters/tilt-rotor.
     3.16.5.3. Mission planners will determine the optimum lunar conditions for NVD
     operations.
  3.16.6. NVD aircraft will follow normal taxi routes during NVD operations.
  3.16.7. Traffic patterns:
     3.16.7.1. Traffic patterns will remain standard IAW paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 of this
     instruction.
     3.16.7.2. Additionally landing zone procedures and SCA approaches as spelled out in
     paragraphs 3.13 and 3.14 of this instruction can be utilized during blackout operations.
     3.16.7.3. Entry/re-entry into the traffic pattern will be at those points normally utilized
     by non-NVD aircraft or as coordinated with Tower via RAFL RAPCON.
     3.16.7.4. In the interest of aerodrome safety, NVD operations will not exceed 6
     participating aircraft/helicopters/tilt-rotor in the pattern. Non-participating aircraft
     requesting lights “on” have priority over NVD/blackout operations.
     3.16.7.5. Non-participating aircraft will not mix with participating NVD aircraft in any
     traffic pattern or on any CMA.
  3.16.8. Vehicle operations should be kept to an absolute minimum during blackout/NVD
  operations.
     3.16.8.1. Participating NVD vehicles are restricted to Taxiway D, Taxiway A, Taxiway
     C, HS 65 and the four hammerheads. Vehicles operating lights-out during periods of
     reduced airfield lighting must use hazard warning flashers so the Tower/aircrew can see
     the vehicle on the airfield prior to NVD operations. Flashers may be turned off once
     NVD operations begin. An additional IR strobe can be used on vehicles to assist aircrews
     using NVDs with identifying traffic on the airdrome.
     3.16.8.2. Vehicles participating in blackout operations must remain vigilant at all times
     and will be restricted to 10 MPH while driving on the airfield.
     3.16.8.3. Non-participating vehicles will not mix with participating NVD vehicles on any
     CMA. NOTE: Vehicles must maintain two-way radio communications with the Control
     Tower while operating within the CMA.
36                                               MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014


  3.16.9. Limitations on ATC separation. Under non-standard light settings, Tower personnel
  may not be able to visually scan the runway environment. Additionally, controllers are
  unable to visually ensure participating aircraft’s landing gear is down and will be unable to
  ensure visual separation between participating aircraft. Aircraft conducting NVD operations
  will land/depart at their “own risk”. NOTE: Tower controllers and AM Ops personnel are
  not authorized to use NVDs.
  3.16.10. When possible transitions in/out of blackout operations or Infrared (IR) lighting
  operations will take place when participating aircraft are on the ground. If this is not possible
  the transition point will be other than a critical phase of flight. Coordination with Tower and
  participating aircraft will take place prior to any lights being turned off/on.
  3.16.11. Emergency “Knock it off”/Termination Procedures:
     3.16.11.1. Suspend NVD operations if an airborne NVD aircraft declares an emergency.
     Tower will coordinate with the aircraft to determine whether to turn on or leave lights off.
     This would be an aircraft commander’s call.
     3.16.11.2. Suspend airborne NVD operations prior to a non-participating VFR aircraft
     entering/transitioning the Mildenhall MATZ or IFR arriving aircraft reaching 10 mile final.
     3.16.11.3. Suspend NVD operations prior to a non-participating aircraft beginning taxi
     operations for departure. Example for suspending NVD operations: “ATTENTION ALL
     AIRCRAFT, NIGHT VISION DEVICE OPERATIONS ARE SUSPENDED DUE TO
     (REASON).”
     3.16.11.4. Suspend NVD operations any time deemed necessary for safety. Example for
     safety suspension of NVD operations: “NVD, TERMINATE”. (Expectation is aircrew
     or Tower will provide amplifying remarks regarding the unsafe condition, lighting will be
     returned to normal, and NVD operations will resume when the unsafe situation has been
     resolved).
  3.16.12. Airfield Lighting configurations.
     3.16.12.1. Tower will turn off runway, approach and PAPI lights when requested by the
     aircraft commander.
     3.16.12.2. NVD operations will be suspended prior to turning on taxiway lights to allow
     non-participating aircraft to begin taxi operations.
     3.16.12.3. IR Assault Landing Zone (ALZ) Lighting. When Runway 29 is in use, 352
     SOG aircraft may request “assault landing zone lighting only” where all lights with the
     exception of the IR AZLs are turned off. The resulting lighting configuration will allow
     landings to a zone approximating a 3,000’ runway.
     3.16.12.4. Runway, approach, PAPIs and taxiway lights will be operated for non-NVD
     operations IAW the following:
         3.16.12.4.1. IFR Arrivals: Prior to aircraft reaching 10 mile final, expect airfield
         lights to be turned on for aircraft conducting a visual approach upon notification from
         RAFL RAPCON the aircraft is 15 miles from airfield.
         3.16.12.4.2. VFR Arrivals: Prior to aircraft reaching approximately 5 miles
         (normally base turn) from airfield.
MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014                                                              37


          3.16.12.4.3. For all arrivals, lights will remain on until aircraft has taxied off the
          landing surface and taxied to parking.
          3.16.12.4.4. As soon as possible after receipt of an inbound on non-NVD aircraft
          from RAFL RAPCON, Tower will advise NVD aircraft the lights are required to be
          turned on.
          3.16.12.4.5. IFR/VFR Departures: Before an aircraft begins taxi operations and until
          it is 5 miles from airfield.
   3.16.13. Tower will state “LIGHTS OUT” when issuing any clearance to participating NVD
   aircraft. This will serve as a reminder to aircrews and controllers of the blackout operations.
   3.16.14. Internal Tower Cab lights should be minimized to the maximum extent possible to
   increase “night vision” of the controllers.
   3.16.15. Aircraft participating in NVD/blackout operations will have position/strobe lights
   on at all times IAW AFI 11-202.
   3.16.16. Time permitting, the following ATIS advisory will be broadcast until
   blackout/NVD operations are terminated: “BLACKOUT/NVD OPERATIONS IN EFFECT.”
3.17. Rapids Training (RT).
   3.17.1. Rapids Training requests must be submitted to 100 OSS/OSA at least 24 hours in
   advance to ensure de-confliction of any other operations. Once approved, AM Ops will issue
   the appropriate NOTAM to restrict/alert non-participating aircraft/personnel.
      3.17.1.1. Rapid on/off-load or "infil/exfil" training may be accomplished in conjunction
      with NVD training. RT entails stopping the aircraft on the runway for approximately 2
      minutes for on or off loading.
   3.17.2. Normally, STS members wearing NVDs, radios and other equipment will off load
   several small motorized vehicles onto the paved taxiways or ramps to position themselves no
   closer than 180’ from the runway/runway edge markings.
   3.17.3. From these positions, STS will set up ATC (simulated) for follow-on traffic. The
   STS, with the permission from Tower, may control participating aircraft on the STS
   frequency during subsequent landings. STS personnel will provide the STS frequency to the
   Tower for monitoring. STS may not control any aircraft when Tower is providing service to
   other air traffic.
   3.17.4. AM Ops will perform a FOD check on all applicable areas when complete, before
   allowing other non-352 SOG aircraft to land/depart or taxi into any area where Rapids
   training occurred.
   3.17.5. Tower Responsibilities:
      3.17.5.1. Act as a safety observer while the STS personnel are controlling operations.
      3.17.5.2. Tower will release a frequency to STS personnel and monitor the frequency
      during all operations.
      3.17.5.3. If at any time, Tower deems it necessary to take control due to traffic,

                                           Chapter 4

                                     IFR PROCEDURES

4.1. IFR Traffic Patterns (Attachment 8).
   4.1.1. Radar traffic pattern – 3,000’ MSL.
4.2. Air Traffic Separation Standards. In addition to the separation standards listed in
FAA JO 7110.65 and CAP 774, the following apply:
   4.2.1. Within Class F and G airspace, regardless of the service being provided, pilots are
   ultimately responsible for collision avoidance and terrain clearance, and they should consider
   service provision to be constrained by the unpredictable nature of this environment. The
   Class F and G airspace environment is typified by the following:
      4.2.1.1. It is not mandatory for a pilot to be in receipt of an Air Traffic Service (ATS);
      this generates an unknown traffic environment.
      4.2.1.2. Controller/Flight Information Service Officer (FISO) workload cannot be
      predicted.
      4.2.1.3. Pilots may make sudden maneuvers, even when in receipt of an ATS.
   4.2.2. A Basic Service is an ATS provided for the purpose of giving advice and information
   useful for the safe and efficient conduct of flights. This may include weather information,
   changes of serviceability of facilities, conditions at aerodromes, general airspace activity
   information, and any other information likely to affect safety. The avoidance of other traffic
   is solely the pilot’s responsibility. NOTE: Basic Service relies on the pilot avoiding other
   traffic, unaided by controllers/ FISOs. It is essential that a pilot receiving this service
   remains alert to the fact that, unlike a Traffic Service and a Deconfliction Service, the
   provider of a Basic Service is not required to monitor the flight.
   4.2.3. A Traffic Service is a surveillance based ATS, where in addition to the provisions of a
   Basic Service, the controller provides specific surveillance derived traffic information to
   assist the pilot in avoiding other traffic. Controllers may provide headings and/or levels for
   the purposes of positioning and/or sequencing; however, the controller is not required to
   achieve deconfliction minima, and the avoidance of other traffic is ultimately the pilot’s
   responsibility.
   4.2.4. A Deconfliction Service is a surveillance based ATS where, in addition to the
   provisions of a Basic Service, the controller provides specific surveillance derived traffic
   information and issues headings and/or levels aimed at achieving planned deconfliction
   minima against all observed aircraft in Class F/G airspace, or for positioning and/or
   sequencing. However, the avoidance of other traffic is ultimately the pilot’s responsibility.
   4.2.5. A Procedural Service is an ATS where, in addition to the provisions of a Basic
   Service, the controller provides vertical, lateral, longitudinal and time instructions, which if
   complied with, shall achieve deconfliction minima against other aircraft participating in the
   Procedural Service. Neither traffic information nor deconfliction advice can be passed with
   respect to unknown traffic. NOTE: A Procedural Service does not require information
   derived from an ATS surveillance system. Therefore, due to the ability for autonomous
MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014                                                              41


   flight in Class F/ G airspace, pilots in receipt of a Procedural Service should be aware of the
   high likelihood of encountering conflicting traffic without warnings being provided by ATC.
   Pilots flying in the vicinity of aerodromes, ATS routes, or navigational aids where it is
   known that a Procedural Service is provided, are strongly encouraged to attempt to establish
   radiotelephony (RTF) contact with the notified ATS provider.
   4.2.6. An aircraft making an altitude restricted low approach over vehicles, taxiing aircraft,
   personnel or equipment on the runway (to include over-runs) shall be instructed to maintain
   at or above 550’ MSL (for heavy aircraft at or above 1,050’ MSL). Tower shall inform the
   personnel on the ground that the aircraft will be conducting restricted low approaches over
   them.
4.3. Surveillance (ASR) and Precision Approach Radar (PAR). ASR/PAR approaches are
not available at RAFM.
4.4. Standard Climb Out Instructions. Unless otherwise coordinated, issue: “DEPART
MILDENHALL VIA RADAR VECTORS. ON DEPARTURE, FLY RUNWAY HEADING. CLIMB
TO FL100.       EXPECT FURTHER CLEARANCE ONCE AIRBORNE.                             DEPARTURE
FREQUENCY 250.3.            ADVISE FIVE MINUTES PRIOR TO DEPARTURE FOR
COORDINATION OF SQUAWK.” Locally assigned aircraft PHRASEOLOGY - "EXECUTE
STANDARD CLIMB-OUT." NOTE: RAFM departures enter Class G (uncontrolled) airspace.
IFR clearances are not issued for the portion of flight into uncontrolled airspace.
4.5. MILDENHALL 7 Departure Procedure (DP). Aircraft departing RAFM are not given a
complete IFR clearance. Instead, use the following format: “DEPART MILDENHALL VIA THE
MILDENHALL SEVEN DEPARTURE AS PUBLISHED, (any altitude restriction), EXPECT
FURTHER CLEARANCE ONCE AIRBORNE, ADVISE FIVE MINUTES PRIOR TO
DEPARTURE FOR COORDINATION FOR SQUAWK.”
   4.5.1. Runway 11: Climb on track 105° to join MLD R-110 outbound. At MLD R-110/7
   DME, turn right heading 280° to intercept MLD R-150. Proceed inbound to MLD TACAN,
   cross at or below FL70. Join MLD R-327 outbound climbing to FL90. Cross MLD R-
   327/23 DME between FL80 and FL90. If further clearance is not received, maintain FL90
   and advise ATC. Expect enroute clearance with London Military.
   4.5.2. Runway 29: Climb on track 285° to join MLD R-281 outbound. At MLD R-281/6
   DME, turn right heading 025° to intercept MLD R-327 outbound. Cross MLD R-327/23
   DME between FL80 and FL90. If further clearance is not received, maintain FL90 and
   advise ATC. Expect enroute clearance with London Military.
4.6. Local Climb Out for IFR Pattern Entry.
   4.6.1. Issue: “Fly runway heading, climb and maintain 3,000” as standard local climb-out
   instructions for all aircraft departing RAFM requesting radar vectors/climb-out to the radar
   pattern. Locally assigned aircraft will be issued: "EXECUTE LOCAL CLIMB-OUT."
   Aircraft will be instructed to maintain at or below 1,300’ MSL until departure end when
   Tower patterns are open to protect the overhead.
   4.6.2. Pilots must inform ATC immediately if unable to comply with controller instructions.
4.7. Go Around/Missed Approach Procedures.
   4.7.1. Procedures shall be IAW FAA JO 7110.65, FLIPs and AFI 13-204v3.
 42                                             MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014


4.8. Breakout Procedures
   4.8.1. Coordinate/notify RAFL RAPCON prior to issuing breakout instructions. Aircraft
   that require breakout while conducting instrument approaches to runways 11/29 and are more
   than 3 miles from RAFM will be issued the following instructions:
      4.8.1.1. Runway 29, Turn left heading 180 climb and maintain 2000’.
      4.8.1.2. Runway 11, Turn left heading 330 climb and maintain 2000’.
   4.8.2. Aircraft that require breakout while conducting instrument approaches to runways
   11/29 and are within 3 miles of RAFM will be issued breakout instructions coordinated with
   RAFL RAPCON depending on traffic.
4.9. Opposite Direction Procedures (Including Circling Approaches).
   4.9.1. RAFL RAPCON is the approving authority for all opposite direction departures.
   4.9.2. RAFM Tower is the approving authority for opposite direction arrivals.
   4.9.3. All coordination must include the phrase "OPPOSITE DIRECTION DEPARTURE
   OR ARRIVAL (as appropriate), RUNWAY (number)."
   4.9.4. IFR/IFR Separation Standards:
      4.9.4.1. Arrival vs. Arrival: Opposite direction arrivals shall not proceed any closer than
      10 flying miles from the runway until a preceding arriving aircraft to the runway in use
      has landed or proceeds as a missed approach and appropriate separation is achieved.
      4.9.4.2. Arrival vs. Departure: Opposite direction arrivals shall not proceed closer than
      10 flying miles from the runway, when a departing aircraft has been released, until
      appropriate separation minima can be achieved.
      4.9.4.3. Departure vs. Arrival: Opposite direction departures shall not be cleared for
      takeoff when an arriving aircraft has reached a point 10 flying miles from the runway,
      until the arrival lands, starts circling procedure, or proceeds as a missed approach.
   4.9.5. VFR operations within the ATZ may be conducted during opposite direction
   operations except VFR operations to/from the runway are not authorized when:
      4.9.5.1. An opposite direction IFR arrival is within 10 flying miles of the runway or;
      4.9.5.2. An opposite direction IFR departure has been cleared for takeoff, until
      appropriate separation minima can be achieved.
4.10. Formation Departures. Formation departures are authorized in visual meteorological
conditions (VMC) and instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) utilizing the following
procedures. NOTE: MARSA departures are not allowed at RAFM.
   4.10.1. Aircraft departing RAFM separately and joining up under RAFL RAPCON control
   cannot be issued the same squawk by London Mil. In this case, the lead aircraft will depart
   on a London Mil assigned code and hold within 30 miles of RAFL below FL 190 or as
   directed by RAFL RAPCON. The second aircraft in the element will be assigned a local
   squawk code until flight join-up. Once join-up occurs, the second element will squawk
   standby and the flight can then continue on the London Mil assigned squawk.
MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014                                                             43


  4.10.2. All aircraft in the formation cell will file a separate flight plan. Formation aircraft
  should file the Mildenhall 7 departure. RAFL RAPCON will attempt to keep formations on
  the standard departure for as long as possible.
  4.10.3. Aircraft will squawk as assigned by RAFL RAPCON.
  4.10.4. Planned formation spacing will be no more than 30 seconds. If separation between
  aircraft exceeds 30 seconds, the lead aircraft will notify Tower and coordinate for separate
  departures.
  4.10.5. The lead aircraft will confirm all formation aircraft are on RAFL RAPCON
  departure frequency prior to commencing takeoff roll.
     4.10.5.1. 352 SOG aircraft will maintain Tower frequency until switched to RAFL
     RAPCON to facilitate notification of any ground abort to Tower and other formation
     aircraft.
  4.10.6. Tower and RAFL RAPCON are not responsible for separation between individual
  formation aircraft.
  4.10.7. The formation lead aircraft should depart using Traffic Service Due to weather or
  operational requirements.
  4.10.8. The lead aircraft will notify RAFL RAPCON on departure frequency when
  commencing takeoff roll. All aircraft will notify RAFL RAPCON once airborne. RAFL
  RAPCON is not required to acknowledge trailing aircraft airborne radio calls.

                               EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

5.1. Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS).
   5.1.1. The purpose of the PCAS is rapid dissemination of emergency information that affects
   the airfield or aircraft operations to emergency response agencies.
   5.1.2. Tower activates the PCAS. Agencies on the PCAS with two-way capability are
   Tower, AM Ops, RAFL Emergency Room, RAFM Flight Surgeon’s Office and FD.
   Agencies with receive-only capability are CP.
      5.1.2.1. 100 CS will not modify the PCAS without prior coordination with 100
      OSS/OSA and approval from 100 OSS/CC.
      5.1.2.2. RAFM Flight Surgeon office is normally available during regular duty hours,
      Monday through Friday. The RAFL Emergency Room will respond with an ambulance
      anytime the RAFM Flight Surgeon is not available.

      5.1.3.18. When, at the discretion of the Tower WS, any condition is viewed as hazardous
      to personnel, aircraft or property.
      5.1.3.19. When directed by CP or FD.
      5.1.3.20. Normally, between 0745L and 0815L for a daily line check. Recording quality
      shall be checked as well.
   5.1.4. Upon activation of the PCAS, all responding crash/rescue vehicles shall not enter any
   portion of the CMA without contacting Tower and receiving permission to enter.
   5.1.5. If AM Ops is advised of an emergency on the airfield and the PCAS has not been
   activated, AM Ops will activate the SCN and then call the Tower to brief them of the
   situation. Since all agencies on the PCAS are also on the SCN (less Tower), Tower will not
   activate the PCAS if the SCN has already been activated.
   5.1.6. When the PCAS is out of service, Tower will dial DSN 238-3930 to activate a
   conference call that rings all PCAS agencies.
   5.1.7. Cancellation of emergencies declared on the primary crash net shall rest with the
   Incident Commander (IC), normally the Fire Chief.
5.2. Secondary Crash Net (SCN).
   5.2.1. The purpose of the SCN is rapid dissemination of emergency information that affects
   the airfield or aircraft operations to emergency response and support agencies.
   5.2.2. AM Ops activates the SCN. Agencies on the SCN are CP, Security Forces, FD,
   Weather, CES Readiness, Wing Safety, ATOC, RAFM Flight Surgeon, RAFL Emergency
   Room, 100 MOF/MOC and 352 SOG/MOC.
   5.2.3. All stations (agencies) on the SCN must use a noise reduction feature, such as push-to-
   talk handsets, that filters out background noise.
   5.2.4. 100 CS will not modify the SCN without prior coordination with 100 OSS/OSA and
   approval from 100 OSS/CC.
   5.2.5. AM Ops will test the SCN each morning NLT 0930L. Any station failing to respond
   will receive a phone call to determine if a problem exists. If there is a problem with the
   station, the agency with the problem will immediately contact 100 CS and open a work
   request for repair.
   5.2.6. AM Ops will relay information received from Tower or another agency verbatim.
   Individuals answering the SCN will remain silent until poled for questions. If there are
   questions, the agency will identify themselves and ask their question.
   5.2.7. When the SCN is out of service, AM Ops will dial DSN 238-1910 to activate a
   conference call with all agencies on the SCN. The backup system will be tested at least once
   a month.
5.3. On/Off Base Crash Notification Procedures.
   5.3.1. The PCAS and SCN will be activated for all on-base crashes. Mishap response will
   be IAW 100 ARW PLAN 91-204, Mishap Response Plan, and AFI 13-204v3.
 46                                            MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014


   5.3.2. When an off-base crash is reported to any base agency, they should immediately
   notify AM Ops. AM Ops will obtain details and the name and phone number of the person
   making the report prior to activating the SCN.
   5.3.3. The IC is normally the Fire Chief until the Emergency Operations Center (EOC)
   Director arrives on scene and assumes command. The IC exercises complete control at the
   scene of all mishaps on base and will work with off base officials through the unified
   command concept; recognizing local jurisdiction primacy status.
5.4. In-Flight Emergency (IFE) Coordination.
   5.4.1. The PCAS and SCN will be activated for all IFEs.
   5.4.2. Tower will notify the IC on the Crash Net when the emergency aircraft is the next
   aircraft to land (normally between 2 and 7 miles on final).
      5.4.2.1. When the IC copies the transmission, they will acknowledge by repeating the
      transmission back to the Tower.
   5.4.3. If the Fire Chief deems runway access is necessary after the aircraft lands, the Fire
   Chief will request runway entry through Ground control. Ground will grant approval based
   on the current traffic situation. The Fire Chief will be responsible for all FD vehicles
   operating on the runway and will inform Ground when all vehicles under the Fire Chief's
   control have vacated the runway. All FD vehicles entering the runway shall monitor the
   Crash LMR net and be prepared to exit the runway immediately if directed to do so by the
   Fire Chief or Ground.
   5.4.4. AM Ops will respond to IFE’s IAW AMOI 13-204 and/or applicable facility Quick
   Reaction Checklists (QRC) as appropriate.
5.5. Ground Emergency (GE) Coordination.
   5.5.1. The PCAS and SCN will be activated for all GEs.
   5.5.2. The Fire Chief, or designated representative, is in charge of ground response to GE’s
   until the emergency is terminated. If the Fire Chief deems runway access, or crossing, is
   necessary, the Fire Chief will request runway entry through Ground control. Ground control
   will grant approval based on the current traffic situation; however, emergency response
   comes first and Tower will generally hold off all aircraft operations in the vicinity of the
   emergency. The Fire Chief will be responsible for all FD vehicles operating on the runway
   and will inform Ground control when all vehicles under the Fire Chief's control have vacated
   the runway. All FD vehicles entering the runway shall monitor the Crash LMR net and be
   prepared to exit the runway immediately if directed to do so by the Fire Chief or Ground
   control.
   5.5.3. AM Ops will respond to GE’s IAW AMOI 13-204 and/or applicable facility QRCs as
   appropriate.
5.6. RAFM Emergency Frequency (UHF 389. 00).
   5.6.1. RAFM Emergency Frequency (UHF 389.00) is utilized for uninterrupted
   communication between Tower and emergency aircraft, and for communication between the
   FD and emergency aircraft (with Tower approval). The FD call sign for radio
   communications during emergency response shall be CHIEF (number), unless otherwise
MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014                                                             47


   coordinated. Although use of this frequency is not mandatory in all IFE situations, when it is
   used, the following procedures are mandatory for ATC and FD personnel:
      5.6.1.1. RAFM Tower shall:
          5.6.1.1.1. Monitor UHF 389.00 upon being advised of an IFE/GE.
          5.6.1.1.2. Approve FD use of UHF 389.00 when the frequency is no longer needed to
          perform ATC functions by stating on UHF 389.00, “CHIEF (number) HAS USE OF
          389.00 UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.”
          5.6.1.1.3. Not relinquish UHF 389.00 to the FD if other aircraft are under ATC
          control and on UHF 389.00.
          5.6.1.1.4. Interrupt or terminate FD use of UHF 389.00 to continue ATC services
          and/or issue instructions as required. NOTE: Emergency aircraft have priority over
          other traffic conditions.
      5.6.1.2. FD shall:
          5.6.1.2.1. Monitor UHF 389.00 upon activation of the PCAS.
          5.6.1.2.2. Not use UHF 389.00 until the tower has approved FD use. Tower shall
          initiate release of 389.00 when no longer needed for ATC purposes. FD use of UHF
          389.00 is strictly for communication with the pilot of an emergency aircraft on the
          ground. FD personnel shall not issue any ATC type instructions. Any person who
          commandeers an ATC frequency assumes responsibility for separation of aircraft
          IAW AFI 13-204v3.
          5.6.1.2.3. Coordinate with the Control Tower to return UHF 389.00 to ATC upon
          emergency termination, when no longer needed or at the request of ATC.
          5.6.1.2.4. Adhere to MILDENHALLI 13-213, Airfield Driving, guidelines on CMA
          crossing procedures when conducting emergency response.
5.7. ATCALS Emergency Warning and Evacuation Alarm.
   5.7.1. Emergency warning and evacuation alarm system is used to notify individuals in and
   around certain runway shelters/sites that an emergency aircraft is approaching to land.
   5.7.2. Controllers will activate the alarm when an emergency aircraft is NLT 15 miles on
   IFR final or as soon as practical if the emergency aircraft is in the VFR pattern. Tower shall
   deactivate the alarm when the hazards no longer exist.
5.8. Hot Brakes Procedures.
   5.8.1. When an aircraft suspects hot brakes, the aircraft will proceed directly to the nearest
   hot brake area located at the Runway 29 Alpha (northeast) and Bravo (southeast)
   Hammerheads and Runway 11 Bravo (southwest) Hammerhead as identified in Attachment
   3. If the aircraft commander intends to shut down in place and egress, they will immediately
   notify the Tower.
   5.8.2. The potential for hot brakes is considered when:
      5.8.2.1. Aircraft commander observes or is notified the brakes are smoking.

       5.8.2.2. Aircraft commander suspects the brakes have been subjected to overheat
       conditions.
       5.8.2.3. Ground personnel see conditions that lead to suspicion of hot brakes.
5.9. Arm/De-Arm Procedures.
   5.9.1. Normal operation of fighter type aircraft with any type of forward firing munitions is
   prohibited at RAFM; therefore, arm/de-arm activities will only be in support of in-flight
   emergencies or diverts.
   5.9.2. Taxiway Bravo Hammerhead (southeast end) is the only arm/de-arm spot on the
   airfield. Aircraft must point in a direction of 287 degrees (parallel to the runway).
       5.9.2.1. For Runway 11 arrivals, aircraft will exit the runway at the Southeast
       Hammerhead.
       5.9.2.2. For Runway 29 arrivals, aircraft will complete a 180 degree turn on the concrete
       portion of the runway and back taxi to the Southeast Hammerhead.
5.10. Hot Gun Area.
   5.10.1. Hardstand 65 is the primary and only hot gun spot on the airfield for aircraft with
   forward firing munitions. These aircraft shall point in a direction of 293 degrees. Hardstand
   65 is the alternate hot gun spot for aircraft with small- arms ammunition. Aircraft with
   directional weapons (helicopters/tilt-rotor) shall position the aircraft so the weapons are
   directed to 293 degrees
   5.10.2. Pad Alpha is the primary hot gun spot for assigned aircraft on the airfield for aircraft
   with small- arms ammunition. Aircraft with directional weapons (helicopters/tilt-rotor) shall
   position the aircraft so the weapons are directed to 290 degrees.
5.11. Hung Flares/Hung Ordnance.
   5.11.1. Hardstand 65 is the only fixed wing hung flare/ordnance spot on the airfield. Tilt
   rotor aircraft may use Pad Alpha or Hardstand 65 as their hung flare spot on the airfield.
   5.11.2. Upon arrival, aircraft will taxi the most direct means possible, at the direction of
   Ground Control, to Hardstand 65.
   5.11.3. If Hardstand 65 is not available, the Fire Chief will coordinate with the Weapons
   Safety Office to determine suitable parking location and then advise the Tower.
5.12. Live Ordnance Jettison. Live ordnance jettison may be accomplished inside a range
danger area with permission of the range control officer. If this is not an option, jettison should
be in deep water, clear of ships and oil rigs.
5.13. Evacuation of Tower and Airfield Management Operations (AM Ops) Facilities.
   5.13.1. Tower evacuation procedures:
       5.13.1.1. The 100 OG/CC has determined that there is no requirement for an alternate
       Tower facility.
       5.13.1.2. If only the Tower is evacuated, personnel will evacuate to the flight-planning
       room in Building 669 (AM Ops) and can be reached at 238-4048/4029.
MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014                                                               49


       5.13.1.3. Tower WS will advise RAFL TWR, RAFM AM Ops and RAFL RAPCON of
       Tower’s evacuation and request RAFL RAPCON monitor UHF 370.250 to advise other
       aircraft of Tower evacuation.
       5.13.1.4. Time permitting, Tower will activate the PCAS and transmit on all assigned
       frequencies, to include UHF 243.0 and VHF 121.5, the Tower is being evacuated and
       airfield operations are suspended. Tower will advise all airborne aircraft in the pattern to
       contact approach control/arrival for further instructions.
       5.13.1.5. All aircraft taxiing out for departure will pull into the approach end hammer-
       head and monitor Tower frequency UHF 370.250, for further instructions.
       5.13.1.6. All aircraft taxiing back to parking after landing will use caution and continue
       to their assigned parking location (base assigned) or follow TA (Transient Alert).
   5.13.2. AM Ops evacuation procedures:
       5.13.2.1. AM Ops evacuation location is Building 809, room 2.41 (OGX/Plans and
       Programs Office).
       5.13.2.2. All evacuation of AM Ops will be coordinated with Tower to ensure all
       personnel are evacuated.
       5.13.2.3. When AM Ops evacuates, they will activate the SCN and advise that AM Ops
       is relocating to Building 809, room 2.41. Until reaching the alternate location, they can
       be reached on the Ground Net.
       5.13.2.4. Upon relocation to building 809, AM Ops will activate the alternate SCN by
       dialing DSN 238-1910 and will advise that they can be reached at DSN 238-7901. AM
       Ops will also notify all base and tenant flying units of their relocation and process for
       flight planning at the alternate location.
   5.13.3. In the event that both Tower and AM Ops must evacuate (i.e. building bomb threat,
   fire, etc.), each facility will complete applicable checklists and items listed above. All
   personnel will meet in Tower parking lot for accountability and then will proceed to bldg
   809, room 2.41 and can be reached at DSN 238-7901 or via LMR.
   5.13.4. Reactivation/Opening Procedures:
       5.13.4.1. Resume operations of the Tower/AM Ops at the direction of 100 ARW/CC,
       100 OG/CC, 100 OSS/CC and/or AOF/CC (or designated representatives).
       5.13.4.2. Request CES inspect the Tower and AM Ops for any structural damage.
       5.13.4.3. Complete applicable facility checklists.
       5.13.4.4. Prior to resuming operations, ensure AM Ops completes an airfield
       check/runway sweep.
5.14. Tower Wind Limitations. The Base Civil Engineer advises the maximum wind velocity
for Tower is 85 knots. When winds are observed reaching 60 knots, or are forecasted within the
next hour to reach 60 knots, Tower personnel will evacuate to AM Ops and the airfield will be
closed.

5.15. Airborne Fuel Dumping (Adjusting Gross Weight). When feasible, coordinate an area
and altitude with the controlling radar facility. For 100 ARW aircraft, the current fuel dumping
location is between the MLD 056/55 and the MLD 056/75 at FL 200. For 352 SOG aircraft, the
current fuel dumping location is between the MLD 056/055 and the MLD 056/75 at FL100.
5.16. Emergency Arresting Barrier Gear Procedures.
   5.16.1. Activating the AAS can take between 15 and 25 minutes, depending on the
   configuration:
       5.16.1.1. For emergency fighter arrivals, the departure end BAK-12 will be activated as a
       minimum.
       5.16.1.2. The departure end Textile system will be treated as a backup and will be
       activated in the event of a failure to the BAK-12 system, or when requested by aircrews.
       5.16.1.3. Barrier Maintenance is responsible for activating/deactivating the AAS
       Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 0730L to 1630L, Tuesday and Thursday from
       0900L to 1630L.
       5.16.1.4. FD will respond to AAS activation/de-activation at all other times.
   5.16.2. Tower will:
       5.16.2.1. Contact Barrier Maintenance directly to connect or disconnect the AAS. Notify
       Fire Department after normal duty hours, on weekends and holidays to connect or
       disconnect the AAS. Advise Barrier Maintenance/FD what AAS are needed (i.e., east or
       west end cables).
       5.16.2.2. Notify AM Ops of AAS activation/de-activation. AM Ops will respond to the
       airfield to conduct a runway/FOD check after the cable is activated/de-activated.
       5.16.2.3. Approve Barrier Maintenance/FD access to the runway to activate or de-
       activate AAS. Once crews take the runway to activate/de-activate the cable, runway
       operations will be suspended until crews have departed the runway and AM Ops has
       completed a runway/FOD check and resumes operations.
   5.16.3. Barrier Maintenance will:
       5.16.3.1. Respond immediately to activate/de-activate required AAS during responsible
       hours. Standby personnel will respond immediately to certify the AAS as operational
       when notified by the FD.
       5.16.3.2. Contact Tower for access to the CMA. Notify Tower when AAS has been
       activated/de-activated and when all personnel and equipment are off the runway.
       5.16.3.3. Advise Tower when AAS is operational and certified.
       5.16.3.4. In case of in-flight emergencies that require AAS activation, Barrier
       Maintenance will activate the AAS and standby at the applicable BAK-12 to certify the
       AAS if it is engaged.
       5.16.3.5. Barrier Maintenance crews may enter and work in the barrier shacks during
       scheduled flying, other than normal inspection times, after notifying the Tower.
       5.16.3.6. Report AAS malfunctions/deficiencies to AM Ops and Tower.
MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014                                                              51


       5.16.3.7. Perform all daily inspections. Schedule all recurring maintenance through AM
       Ops. Notify AOF/CC at least 60 days prior to annual certification engagement
       requirement date.
   5.16.4. FD will:
       5.16.4.1. Activate/de-activate AAS outside of normal Barrier Maintenance hours,
       weekends, US and UK holidays or as requested in advance by Barrier Maintenance.
       When called to activate the AAS; immediately notify the on-call Barrier Maintenance
       standby person to respond and certify the AAS as operational. NOTE: The AAS is not
       usable until it is certified by Barrier Maintenance. It may take up to 45 minutes for the
       standby person to arrive and certify the system.
       5.16.4.2. Contact Tower for access to AAS and notify Tower when AAS has been
       activated/de-activated.
       5.16.4.3. Remove the AAS cable to the side of the runway at the edge of the hard surface
       when de-activated.
   5.16.5. Emergency AAS Procedures:
       5.16.5.1. Tower will sequence traffic for successive BAK-12 engagements with a
       minimum separation interval of 20 minutes. More separation may be required as the
       situation dictates.
       5.16.5.2. AM Ops will notify 100 MOF/MOC to initiate aircraft recovery/removal
       operations; TA personnel will tow aircraft from the runway if required.
       5.16.5.3. Barrier Maintenance will certify the BAK-12 prior to the next engagement.
5.17. Jettison of External Stores. The jettisoning of external stores will depend upon the
aircraft’s location and the criticality of the emergency.
   5.17.1. Generally, for inert ordnance, it is best to jettison external stores, if able, on EGD
   207 Holbeach (MLD R-347/33 to MLD R-030/66). If unable to reach Holbeach, utilize any
   UK range.
   5.17.2. Radio contact should be established with the range control agency. If radio contact
   cannot be established, stores may be jettisoned over water, visually clear of shipping and oil
   rigs. If IMC, jettison of external stores at least 3 NM out to sea under the control of a radar
   control agency.
5.18. Predetermined Bailout Procedures. Due to the characteristics of wing assigned aircraft,
there is no pre-determined bailout location. In the event an aircrew abandons their aircraft, the
pilot should make every feasible effort to advise ATC of the aircraft’s position prior to
abandonment. Tower will plot the position on the base crash grid maps.
5.19. Refueling Hose Jettison Procedures. In the event a hose must be jettisoned on the
airfield, the grass area south of the runway between Taxiway Charlie and Taxiway Delta is
designated as the refueling hose jettison area. This area should be used only in the event of an
emergency.
 52                                               MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014


5.20. Hydrazine Procedures.
   5.20.1. In the event an F-16 activates its EPU, there is a potential for a hydrazine leak.
   Hydrazine is a caustic substance that has the potential to cause harm if fumes are inhaled.
   5.20.2. Tower will activate the PCAS, and have the pilot hold the aircraft on Taxiway “A”
   hammerhead of Runway 29 or the Taxiway “B” hammerhead of Runway 11 and face the
   aircraft into the wind. FD will establish a 500’ cordon around the aircraft.
5.21. Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft/Hijack Procedures. In the event of a suspected or
confirmed hijack, Tower will immediately activate the PCAS. Ground should first attempt to
contact the pilot on ground and emergency frequencies for aircraft not authorized taxi. Airfield
management will activate the SCN relaying the current position and other pertinent information.
Tower will assist the IC by forwarding updated information and relaying any orders or
instructions IAW FAA JO 7610.4.
5.22. Lost Communications Procedures.
   5.22.1. Ground Traffic.
       5.22.1.1. Vehicles experiencing lost communication while within the CMA will
       immediately exit the movement area and face vehicle towards the Tower and flash
       headlights. The vehicle will then wait for light gun instructions from the Tower. Tower
       may also flash runway lights to signal vehicle to immediately exit the CMA. Vehicle
       operators will proceed to nearest phone and notify Tower when clear of runway or CMA.
       5.22.1.2. Aircraft experiencing lost communications while on the ground will hold
       position, flash landing lights towards the Tower and wait for light gun instruction from
       the Tower.
           5.22.1.2.1. If the aircraft position prohibits Tower’s observation of the landing lights,
           the aircraft should hold position and deplane an aircrew member to establish contact
           with the Tower; for example, stop a passing vehicle with a radio.
           5.22.1.2.2. Fighter aircraft may reposition within the hammerhead to face the aircraft
           towards the Tower.
   5.22.2. In-flight Traffic.
       5.22.2.1. Aircraft experiencing lost communication while in the Tower pattern will rock
       wings (daytime) or flash landing lights (night time) while on downwind or final and
       proceed to a full stop landing on last assigned runway, exit the runway expeditiously and
       continue to follow light gun signals.
       5.22.2.2. If radio failure occurs or is suspected, squawk 7600 on the transponder and
       proceed via expected arrival routes. When given a flashing green light gun signal, go to
       the appropriate runway. Rock the aircraft’s wings on receipt, and watch Tower for light
       gun signals on final approach. A steady green light indicates clearance to land. If a
       steady green light gun signal is not received on final, go around and repeat the procedure.
       5.22.2.3. Exit the runway after landing, turn towards the Tower and wait for an
       appropriate light gun signal before taxiing. Do not cross the runway during taxi unless
       Tower has provided the appropriate light gun signal for runway access.
MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014                                                            53


      5.22.2.4. At all times during actual or suspected radio failures, visually check for other
      aircraft and give way.
   5.22.3. Helicopter/ Tilt-Rotor VFR.
      5.22.3.1. Helicopter/ Tilt-rotor experiencing a loss of communications while on a VFR
      flight plan should continue to maintain VMC. Proceed VFR to RAFM, squawk 7600,
      enter downwind 1 mile south of the field at 700’ MSL and flash landing lights in the
      Tower's direction.
      5.22.3.2. Follow the instructions from the Tower given by light gun signals. Upon
      receipt of steady green light, proceed direct to Pad Delta for full stop landing. Taxi to
      park after receiving the appropriate light gun signal.
5.23. Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT).
   5.23.1. When Tower receives ELT signals, they will confirm receipt with RAFL RAPCON
   and Distress and Diversion (D&D).
   5.23.2. Tower shall advise AM Ops when an ELT is received and when the signal ceases, is
   located, or when additional information becomes available.
      5.23.2.1. AM Ops will contact CP, TA and the MOCs for the 100 ARW, 352 SOG and
      95 RS to assist with the search on RAFM.
      5.23.2.2. If RAFM search does not locate the cause, AM Ops will notify Kinloss ARCC
      for additional assistance. AM Ops will notify the agencies above for termination.
   5.23.3. Tower will coordinate with UK D&D Cell for approval via commercial number
   01895-426150 when aircraft/maintenance personnel request to conduct an ELT test.
5.24. Reduced Fire Fighting Capabilities. FD will notify AM Ops, Tower and CP of any
status change. The CP will provide all pertinent information to the 100 OG/CC who directs
changes to flying operations at RAFM. AM Ops will publish appropriate NOTAMs as required.

                                           Chapter 6

               AIRFIELD/CMA/VEHICLE/PEDESTRIAN OPERATIONS

6.1. Airfield Driving. RAFM airfield driving procedures and program management are
outlined in MILDENHALLI 13-213, Airfield Driving.
6.2. CMA.
   6.2.1. The CMA includes the runway, both overruns, and 180’ of all areas adjacent to the
   runways and overruns. Personnel and vehicles operating on the infields will use the barrier
   shacks as a visual reference. See Attachment 3.
   6.2.2. Anytime Tower is open, all aircraft, vehicles and personnel must establish and
   maintain two-way radio communications with the Tower and obtain Tower’s approval prior
   to entering the CMA. Operators can contact Tower via ground net or ground frequencies.
   Only vehicles in direct support of mission essential activities are authorized to operate within
   the CMA.
      6.2.2.1. When Tower is closed, all authorized vehicles requiring access to the runway
      should follow the following procedures:
          6.2.2.1.1. Attempt to contact Tower on applicable frequency/nets.
          6.2.2.1.2. When Tower does not answer, verify Tower/airfield closure with CP.
          Once verified, announce vehicle call sign and intentions (Example: “Crash 1 is
          proceeding across Runway 11/29 at Taxiway Charlie”).
          6.2.2.1.3. Cross or enter the runway.
          6.2.2.1.4. When across or off the runway, make another radio transmission to
          announce you are “off the runway.”
          6.2.2.1.5. Normal emergency lighting should still be used when on or crossing the
          runway to enhance vehicle visibility.
   6.2.3. Specific procedures for airfield driving, privately owned vehicle passes, airfield
   driving violations and penalties, vehicle traffic (to include bicycle traffic), vehicular call
   signs, gaining CMA access, emergency vehicle operations, airfield construction restrictions,
   and miscellaneous procedures are prescribed in MILDENHALLI 13-213, Airfield Driving
   and are IAW AFI 13-213, Airfield Driving.
   6.2.4. Taxiways (except for portions within 180’ mentioned above) and aprons are not part
   of the CMA. Radio contact with the Tower and Tower’s approval are not normally required
   in these areas; however, personnel operating in areas which may impact aircraft operations
   outside the CMA may be required to establish/maintain radio contact as directed by AM Ops.
   6.2.5. Tower will record all CMA violations in its daily events log.
      6.2.5.1. Vehicle violations will be reported to AM Ops and Security Forces. Violations
      will be managed IAW MILDENHALLI 13-213, Airfield Driving, and reported IAW AFI
      91-202, The Air Force Mishap Prevention Program. In all cases, Wing Safety will be
      notified by AM Ops.
MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014                                                               55


       6.2.5.2. Aircraft violations will be reported to 100 OSS/OSA. Violations will be
       managed IAW AFI 13-204v3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs, and
       reported IAW AFI 91-202, The Air Force Mishap Prevention Program. In all cases,
       Wing Safety will be notified by 100 OSS/OSA.
   6.2.6. Though not part of the CMA, any individuals performing work on the Runway 11 or
   29 localizer shelters shall be in radio contact with the Tower due to potential jet blast in the
   event of aircraft usage of the underrun/overrun.
   6.2.7. When personnel and vehicles are recalled from the CMA, they will withdraw to a safe
   distance from the runway (at least 180’ from the runway/overrun edge). If radio contact is

                           FLIGHT PLANNING PROCEDURES

7.1. Flight Plan Data.
   7.1.1. All aircraft departing RAFM must have a flight plan on file.
   7.1.2. European airspace is very congested and especially saturated during the summer
   months and holidays. To better manage the airspace, the Central Flow Management Unit
   (CFMU) in Brussels, Belgium, frequently issues a Calculated Take-Off Time (CTOT) to an
   aircraft departing on a General Air Traffic (GAT) flight plan.
       7.1.2.1. A CTOT is defined as the time when the aircraft must takeoff. In order to
       reduce the impact and chances of receiving a CTOT, all aircrews must file their flight
       plans as early as possible.
       7.1.2.2. Once a CTOT is issued, the aircraft must take off no earlier than 5 minutes prior,
       and no later than 10 minutes after the issued CTOT time.
       7.1.2.3. AM Ops will notify Tower and RAFL RAPCON of CTOTs.
       7.1.2.4. If an aircraft cannot meet the CTOT slot window, AM Ops must request a new
       CTOT.
       7.1.2.5. CTOTs are issued on a last filed basis. Anything less than 4 hours almost
       certainly means a CTOT will be issued. Any changes made after an aircraft’s flight plan
       is filed, other than altitudes and minor changes with ATC, will cause the flight plan to be
       re-filed and subject to a CTOT.
       7.1.2.6. GAT is defined as traffic that can file an IFR flight plan, follow ATC
       instructions, communicate with ATC, and has necessary equipment to follow a prescribed
       route. GAT flight plans must be filed with AM Ops at least 4 hours prior to Estimated
       Block Out Time (EBOT).
       7.1.2.7. Operational Air Traffic (OAT) is defined as traffic that cannot comply with
       provisions of GAT. OAT flight plans must be filed with AM Ops at least 1 hour prior
       EBOT.
   7.1.3. All flight plans filed must be completed IAW FLIP General Planning, Chapter 4.
   Departure routes must comply with United Kingdom Standard Route Document, available on
   line at the UK National Air Traffic Services website at www.ais.org.uk. Those not filing
   preferred routes per this publication may experience departure delays.
   7.1.4. 352 SOG, 95 RS, 351 ARS and prior coordinated flights from RAF Fairford may fax
   (DSN 238-8301) a DD Form 1801 flight plan or digitally sign and email to AM Ops
   (100oss.osab@us.af.mil ) in lieu of filing in person. Temporary duty (TDY) units may
   utilize these procedures with AM Ops approval. Any flight plan faxed or emailed must be
   followed up with a phone call to AM Ops (DSN 238-7676 or 238-7675) to ensure receipt and
   accuracy.
MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014                                                            57


  7.1.5. Any unit that files flight plans by fax or scan/email must maintain all original flight
  planning forms for disposition IAW AF WEB-RIMS Records Disposition Schedule (RDS),
  Table 13-07, Rule 3.00.
  7.1.6. Original flight plans may not be accepted via radio; however, flight plans filed with
  AM Ops can be amended via any means. Transient aircraft on a stopover flight may re-file
  with AM Ops via the radio provided AM Ops can verify the original flight plan is on file at
  another base. AM Ops will contact original departure location for confirmation and then
  enter requested flight plan information. AM Ops cannot amend flight plans filed by TACC
  IAW AFI 13-204v3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs.
  7.1.7. AM Ops shall relay the following information to Tower and RAFL RAPCON on all
  proposed departures and actual inbounds:
     7.1.7.1. Type of flight plan: Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) or Visual Flight Rules (VFR).
     7.1.7.2. Call sign.
     7.1.7.3. Type aircraft.
     7.1.7.4. Proposed departure or estimated arrival time.
     7.1.7.5. Requested altitude.
     7.1.7.6. First fix in the route (RAFL RAPCON only).
     7.1.7.7. Destination airport (departures only) or estimated time en route (round robin and
     IFR local flight plans only).
     7.1.7.8. Special information or instructions relating to hazardous cargo, DV, medical
     evacuation flights.

  taxiways and aprons (hardstands).
     8.6.2.1. Imaginary surfaces are surfaces in space that are established around an airfield in
     relation to the runway. They define the airspace around the airfield that must be free of
     obstacles.
     8.6.2.2. A clear zone is an area on the ground which must be free of obstructions. A
     frangibility zone is an area within a clear zone in which all authorized deviations must be
     frangible.
  8.6.3. An obstruction is a natural or manmade, fixed or mobile object that violates airfield
  clearances or projects into imaginary airspace surfaces.
     8.6.3.1. Fixed obstacles include manmade or natural features such as buildings, trees,
     terrain and any other feature constituting possible hazards to moving aircraft.
     8.6.3.2. Mobile obstacles include parked aircraft, parked and moving vehicles, and
     ground support equipment that constitute a possible hazard to moving aircraft.
  8.6.4. Certain facilities, equipment, and operations essential to the operation of an airfield
  may violate airfield obstruction criteria. These permissible deviations are listed in USAFEI
  32-1007, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design. Fixed and mobile obstructions not
  cited as a permissible deviation are not authorized without a 100 ARW/CC and USAFE/CV
  waiver processed IAW USAFEI 32-1007, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design.
  8.6.5. Any agency wishing to conduct operations or place fixed or mobile obstacles, even if
  they are permissible deviations, must coordinate and receive approval from AM Ops.
  Temporary waivers are required for any construction project that violates airfield criteria or
  affects airfield operations. Temporary construction waiver requests must include a
  construction phase plan, an airfield safety plan and an operational risk management (ORM)
  assessment. Temporary construction waivers must be reviewed by MAJCOM Terminal
  Instrument Procedures (TERPs) Office and approved by 100 ARW/CC prior to the start of
  any construction activities.
  8.6.6. Ground Support Equipment (Mobile). Mobile ground support equipment is exempt
  from apron clearance distance criteria but not taxilane or taxiway requirements. Examples of
  ground support equipment exempt under this category are aerospace ground equipment,
  electrical carts, forklifts, tow bar trailers, fire extinguisher carts, material handling
  equipment, airfield maintenance stands and portable floodlights. Similar equipment may be
  included in this category.
  8.6.7. When support equipment is not in use, it must be removed from aircraft parking areas
  and stored in areas that do not violate lateral clearance requirements, taxilane/taxiway
  clearance requirements or other imaginary surfaces. Equipment in use is defined as support
  equipment in place not more than three hours before aircraft arrival or three hours after
  aircraft departure.
MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014                                                           61

   BWC. AM Ops, with coordination from the contracted bird control team, can lower the BWC.
   8.17.2. Tower will advise AM Ops of any increase or decrease in wildlife activity. AM Ops
   or Tower will coordinate with Bird Control to respond and disperse the wildlife from the
   airfield and assist in dispersing as required. AM Ops will notify CP anytime the BWC
   changes.
   8.17.3. Tower will relay changes to the BWC to RAFL RAPCON and include on the ATIS.
   RAFL RAPCON will relay the current BWC to all inbound aircraft.
   8.17.4. Bird Watch Conditions:
      8.17.4.1. SEVERE: Bird activity on or immediately above the active runway or other
      specific location representing high potential for strikes. Supervisors and aircrews must
      thoroughly evaluate mission need before conducting operations in areas under condition
      SEVERE. There will be no takeoffs, landings or approaches during BWC SEVERE
      unless specifically approved by the aircraft owning commander: 100 OG/CC, 352
      SOG/CC, 727 AMS/CC or 95 RS/CC. Aircraft commanders shall advise Tower if an
      owning commander approves.
      8.17.4.2. MODERATE: Bird activity near the active runway or other specific location
      representing increased potential for strikes. For all crews, initial takeoff and final landing
      are allowed only when departure and arrival routes will avoid bird activity. Multiple
      IFR/VFR traffic patterns are prohibited. BWC MODERATE requires increased vigilance
      by all. Airborne crews will be cautioned by Tower and will be approved for one full stop
      landing. If multiple landings are required, the aircraft commander will use an alternate
      airfield or wait for BWC LOW. EXCEPTION: IAW 352 SOG OI 91-212, airborne 352
      SOG owned/gained aircraft will evaluate mission requirements utilizing established
      ORM procedures and will advise Tower of their intentions. 352 SOG owned/gained
      crews that have not departed will coordinate with their unit leadership to ensure mission
      requirements are balanced with ORM.
      8.17.4.3. LOW: Bird activity on and around the airfield representing low potential for
      strikes.
8.18. Supervisor of Flying (SOF).
   8.18.1. There is a SOF position and equipment located in the Tower. It is available for use
   by personnel, determined by unit commander, that require close coordination between the
   aircraft and the Tower in order to complete a specific mission.
MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014                                                           67


  8.18.2. Normally, SOF personnel in the Tower will be limited to one person. During
  emergencies, special and unusual operations, shift changes, planned training periods and base
  exercises; there may be a few additional personnel. In no case will the number of personnel
  be of such a size to interfere with ATC operations as determined by the Tower WS.
  Exceptions may be approved after coordination with the Chief Controller, AOF/CC or 100
  OG/CC, as necessary.
  8.18.3. FOD checks. 100 OG/CC has approved the 48 FW SOF to waive FOD checks for 48
  FW aircraft ONLY. The 48 FW SOF will advise the Control Tower Watch Supervisor (WS)
  when they waive a FOD check for their aircraft. Tower will advise AM Ops when the SOF
  waives a FOD sweep for 48 FW aircraft.
  8.18.4. Cable configuration. During periods of 48 FW flying, the departure end BAK-12
  will be activated and upon request, the arrival end BAK-12 may be activated for F-15
  operations. The 48 FW SOF will coordinate with Tower WS and AM Ops to coordinate with
  affected agencies to ensure timely configuration of the cables. Personnel must be proactive
  to ensure configuration of the cables does not delay higher priority operations.
  8.18.5. 48 FW aircraft arrivals. 48 OG/CC has directed NO overhead patterns at RAF
  Mildenhall. All 48 FW aircraft will recover via instrument approach or vectors to visual
  straight-in for a full stop landing. There may be a case-by-case basis of an aircraft
  accomplishing one overhead pattern for syllabus reasons and will only be approved after 48
  OG/CC approval. The 48 FW SOF is the on-site representative of the 48 OG/CC. NOTE:
  Local aircraft priorities. There are no changes to aircraft priorities as listed in this AOI.

8.19. Minimum Communications Launch and Recovery Procedures
   8.19.1. Activation Procedures.
   8.19.2. Minimum Communications (Min Comm) procedures will be implemented for all
   aircraft operations at RAFM when directed by the 100 ARW/CC. In addition, they may be
   selectively implemented by squadron or group CC or DO for training, exercises or real-world
   operations. These procedures will not be initiated during peacetime if one or more of the
   following conditions exist:
      8.19.2.1. The Tower is out of service.
      8.19.2.2. A Min Comm officer (callsign TANGO) is not on duty in the Tower. For the
      100 OG, this will normally be the duty instructor/Red Baron.
   8.19.3. Any time an aircrew member, TANGO, Tower controller, or other appropriate
   agency considers safety jeopardized by Min Comm, they will transmit in the clear until such
   time safety is no longer jeopardized.
   8.19.4. Exceptions.
      8.19.4.1. Arriving transient aircraft will be exempt from Min Comm procedures during
      their initial arrival; however, on departure, these aircraft will comply with the
      requirements. AM Ops will ensure outbound transient aircrews are briefed on Min
      Comm procedures when aircraft file their flight plans.
      8.19.4.2. Aircraft conducting multiple practice approaches (IFR or VFR) will use in the
      clear communications. Practice approaches will normally be disapproved during Min
      Comm operations unless specifically authorized by the 100 ARW/CC.
   8.19.5. Coordination.
      8.19.5.1. Unit operations officers must prior coordinate Min Comm procedures with 100
      OSS/OSA and receive approval by the 100 OG/CC. Normally, coordination must be
      accomplished no later than 1500 local hours the day prior to the scheduled departure(s).
      As a minimum, requests must include:
          8.19.5.1.1. Aircraft call sign and tail number.

     8.19.5.2. For peacetime training, when the Battle Staff is not in session, the published
     flying schedule is sufficient coordination for Min Comm operations. The Min Comm
     officer must confirm the published information with maintenance, AM Ops and Tower.
     8.19.5.3. The requesting flying unit operations officer will designate a Min Comm
     officer (callsign TANGO). TANGO must be in the Tower representing the flying unit
     during the Min Comm operation.
  8.19.6. TANGO Responsibilities.
     8.19.6.1. Coordinate with applicable MOC to ensure maintenance personnel comply with
     Min Comm procedures. If practical, arrange to park participating aircraft to facilitate
     Min Comm operations.
     8.19.6.2. Coordinate all Min Comm aircraft movements with the Tower Watch
     Supervisor.
     8.19.6.3. Maintain a Min Comm timing sheet and relay the appropriate timing
     information to the Tower Watch Supervisor.
     8.19.6.4. Monitor weather and advise Tower Watch Supervisor when it is necessary to
     broadcast weather data. If practical, maintain an aircrew weather-briefing sheet for each
     mission.
  8.19.7. Taxi/Departure Procedures.
     8.19.7.1. Unless otherwise coordinated, all participating aircraft are expected to squawk
     Mode 3 code 0460 and depart via the Mildenhall 7 Departure Procedure as published in
     the FLIP. Once airborne, aircraft will contact RAFL Departure and receive their assigned
     Mode 3 code.
     8.19.7.2. All aircraft will have an engine start time, taxi no earlier time, taxi no later than
     time, and an estimated/scheduled takeoff time. The taxi no earlier time will be 10 minutes
     prior to the taxi no later than time. All ATC information, instructions and control actions
     are based on these times.
  8.19.8. Tower Procedures.
     8.19.8.1. If requested by TANGO, at the taxi no earlier time for each departing aircraft
     or flight cell, Tower will broadcast on Tower frequency (UHF and VHF simultaneously)
     the runway in use, wind, altimeter setting, runway surface conditions (if other than dry)
     and any weather warnings or advisories in effect. Ceiling and visibility will be included
     when the reported weather is less than basic VFR.
     8.19.8.2. Coordinate departure instructions with RAFL RAPCON at least 5 minutes prior
     to each departure and request release as appropriate. No verbal departure instructions
70                                               MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014


     will be issued unless they are different from the standard departure instructions identified
     in paragraph 4.5.
     8.19.8.3. Aircraft are to proceed up to the runway hold lines located on the hammerhead
     and face the Tower. A steady green light from Tower signifies “CLEARED FOR
     TAKEOFF.”
     8.19.8.4. A steady green light need only be given to the lead aircraft. Subsequent aircraft
     in the flight are expected to depart in turn after the lead aircraft commences takeoff.
     8.19.8.5. Tower will make all efforts to coordinate release and issue the appropriate light
     gun signal at least 2 minutes prior to scheduled takeoff time. Aircrew will acknowledge
     by turning on the landing light.
     8.19.8.6. If visibility precludes seeing the light, Tower will broadcast “Green light check
     on Tower frequency.” The aircrew will acknowledge by broadcasting “Green light on
     Tower frequency.”
     8.19.8.7. Once the green light is received either visually or verbally, the aircraft/flight is
     cleared for takeoff (Squawk will be issued by RAFL Departure when airborne).
  8.19.9. Aircrew Procedures.
     8.19.9.1. Start engines and taxi radio silent. Monitor Tower frequency (UHF and VHF)
     and Guard until safely airborne and then contact RAFL Departure or as directed by ATC.
     8.19.9.2. Attempt to taxi on the taxi no earlier than time. Do not taxi after the taxi no
     later than time without Tower and TANGO approval.
     8.19.9.3. Be ready to takeoff 5 minutes prior to scheduled takeoff time.
     8.19.9.4. Aircraft will contact RAFL Departure on the assigned RAFL Departure
     frequency once airborne. Fighter aircraft will change to RAFL Departure upon takeoff
     clearance and contact Departure once airborne.
  8.19.10. Aircraft experiencing problems:
     8.19.10.1. If in the chocks, flash landing/taxi lights to alert maintenance personnel. If
     unable to taxi by the taxi no earlier than time, transmit on Tower frequency, “(Call sign)
     delete.” Unless real world Min Comm, the problem aircraft is no longer restricted to Min
     Comm and can request maintenance in clear text.
     8.19.10.2. If while taxiing, transmit on Tower frequency, “(Call sign) delete.”
     8.19.10.3. If the problem aircraft is part of a flight and it is possible without
     compromising safety, continue to taxi with the flight. When the flight is cleared for
     takeoff and the problem aircraft is next for departure, broadcast to Tower, “(Call sign)
     delete,” taxi down the runway and exit at the first available intersection. Once off the
     runway, transmit on Tower frequency, “(Call sign) is off the runway.” Tower will then
     initiate a “green light” for the next aircraft in the flight to resume the takeoff clearance.
     8.19.10.4. No aircraft will start takeoff roll without ATC takeoff clearance and positive
     knowledge the runway is clear.
MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014                                                                71


      8.19.10.5. For the problem aircraft, Min Comm is no longer required. Request taxi
      clearance on Ground frequency and maintenance on the appropriate frequency.
      8.19.10.6. If the problem aircraft cannot continue taxiing, it should pull out of the taxi
      route as quickly as possible. Unless an actual threat exists, Min Comm is no longer
      required. Request maintenance in clear text on appropriate frequency. Notify Mildenhall
      Ground on Ground frequency.
      8.19.10.7. If during takeoff roll, transmit on Tower frequency, “(Call sign) ABORT,
      ABORT, ABORT.” If it will not compromise safety, continue to taxi and exit the runway
      at the first available intersection. Unless an actual threat exists, Min Comm is no longer
      required. If immediate assistance is required, the aircraft will be expected to transmit in
      the clear on Tower frequency.
   8.19.11. Arrival Procedures.
      8.19.11.1. Normal arrival procedures apply to all participating aircraft until handed off to
      Tower.
      8.19.11.2. On initial contact with Tower, arriving aircraft will state, “Mildenhall Tower,
      (Call sign), distance (DME).” Tower will respond with, call sign, wind, and landing
      clearance. No further communication is required. If landing clearance cannot be granted,
      Tower will issue appropriate instructions (breakout, missed approach or alternate
      instructions) on UHF.
      8.19.11.3. As soon as the aircraft makes its call to Tower, TANGO will notify the
      applicable CP or MOC via landline to request a follow-me vehicle to meet the aircraft
      after landing.
      8.19.11.4. After landing, arrival aircraft will exit the runway at the end of the runway
      and monitor UHF and VHF until off the runway. When off the runway, monitor Ground
      on UHF and follow the follow-me to parking.
8.20. Exercise Participation/Coordination.
   8.20.1. All exercises that involve any ATC facility or the airport CMA must be coordinated
   with 100 OSS/OSA NLT 48 hours prior to the exercise. All exercises that involve the use of
   any portion of the airfield must additionally be coordinated with 100 OSS/OSAA. Local
   lower-level exercises may be coordinated with 100 OSS/OSA the day of the scenario to
   ensure airfield operations are not affected.
   8.20.2. Tower WSs and AM Ops Supervisors have the authority to determine the extent of
   participation once an exercise begins. Supervisors may terminate their participation if safety
   of flight will be jeopardized or services degraded.
   8.20.3. All exercise transmissions/messages shall be preceded by the words; “EXERCISE,
   EXERCISE, EXERCISE.”
8.21. Runway Operations During Exercises.
   8.21.1. All aircraft are considered exercise-exempt unless an exercise evaluator or aircraft
   commander notifies the Control Tower otherwise. Exercise-exempt aircraft will not be delayed
   for exercise purposes due to real-world commitments and the need to keep traffic flowing
   smoothly. Any attacking aircraft will be delayed or canceled to allow exercise-exempt aircraft to
 72                                                MILDENHALLI13-204 14 OCTOBER 2014


   depart on time, unless the pilot concurs with the delay. Simulated airfield attacks using fictitious
   aircraft will be delayed or cancelled to allow exercise-exempt aircraft to depart on time, unless
   the pilot concurs with the delay. Simulated airfield attacks using fictitious aircraft may occur
   within the coordinated attack window but the exercise-exempt aircraft will continue normal
   operations.
   8.21.2. 100 ARW/IGI will brief 100 OSS/OSA and 100 OSS/OSAA at least 48 hours in
   advance of exercises that involve any ATC facility or affect the airfield. 100 ARW/XPX will
   ensure a Tower-qualified Wing Inspection Team (WIT) member is present whenever actual
   aircraft are scheduled to conduct an airfield attack. The Tower EET member will coordinate
   all attack details with the Tower WS.
      8.21.2.1. Coordination of earliest/latest times that aircraft may attack.
      8.21.2.2. Takeoff clearances will be cancelled before attacking aircraft receive
      permission to fly closer than 15 miles straight-in.
      8.21.2.3. Arriving aircraft on final approach must land or depart the area before attacking
      aircraft receive permission to fly closer than 15 miles straight-in.
      8.21.2.4. Jointly determine whether the attacking aircraft will remain on RAFL
      frequency or be on RAFM Control Tower's frequency.
      8.21.2.5. If attacking aircraft are delayed beyond the latest window time, they will not be
      allowed to attack unless a new time is coordinated.
   8.21.3. Tower will allow the Disaster Assessment Reconnaissance Team (DART) runway
   access as soon as possible after an attack; traffic permitting and without delaying departing
   aircraft unless the pilot concurs with the delay. If traffic does not allow the DART prompt
