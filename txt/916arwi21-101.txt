SUMMARY OF CHANGES

It outlines the procedures and responsibilities for Maintenance Investigations and Impoundment.
1. General.
   1.1. Investigation – Conduct an investigation to find the cause of mishap in order to take
   preventive action. During the investigation, findings, and recommendations of significance
   may be identified and the equipment or aircraft may be impounded.
 2                                                         916ARWI21-101 3 FEBRUARY 2012


     1.2. Impoundment – The isolation or control of access to an aircraft or equipment item and
     applicable historical records so an intensified investigation can be completed.
     1.3. Aircraft, Age Equipment, Booms, Auxiliary Power Unit, and other items can be
     impounded.
2. Mandatory Impoundment.
     2.1. In addition to the minimum impoundment conditions outlined in AFI 21-101, the
     following are mandatory impoundment conditions:
        2.1.1. Any malfunction that results in un-commanded change in attitude, altitude, or
        heading is unresponsive to pilot input or has a chronic flight control malfunction. If a
        problem stops when the pilot deactivates the Automatic Flight Control System,
        impoundment is not required.
        2.1.2. Flight control surface lockup.
        2.1.3. Any loss of throttle controls.
        2.1.4. Total electrical failure.
        2.1.5. Repeat condition after first impoundment.
        2.1.6. Any discrepancy in the judgment of the senior maintenance supervisors resulting
        in a compromise of the aircraft’s airworthiness, contaminated fuel, abnormal landing gear
        operation, safety of flight, or Foreign Objects Damage (FOD) incidents.
        2.1.7. Aircraft system contamination: All equipment associated with the contaminated
        system (for example: fuel, oil, hydraulics, or gaseous oxygen) will be impounded.
        2.1.8. If an aircraft is suspected of having contaminated fuel, all associated equipment in
        use will be ceased and aircraft will be grounded. Identify the source of the containment
        and inform the appropriate authority. If contaminated fuel was transferred to another
        aircraft, notify the receiving unit. All aircraft will be grounded until the source of the
        contamination is confirmed and all aircraft are verified to be free of contaminated fuel.
        2.1.9. Consider impounding when a depot team or engineering assist is requested and
        dispatched to troubleshoot or repair assigned aircraft.
3. Reportable, But Not Mandatory Impoundment.
     3.1. The following items are reportable and will generate a 916 ARW Form 3, Aircraft

        checklist.
        3.1.4. If the aircraft ground aborts after the aircrew takes possession of the aircraft and
        the aircraft does not fly because of maintenance related problem.
