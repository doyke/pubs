1. General Information.
1.1. Each Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) member is appointed by their respective commander
and assigned to the EET as an additional duty. This appointment memorandum is maintained by
the 439 EET Chief, (439 AW/CCO) and Emergency Management, (439 MSG/CEX).
1.2. EET members are trained using the Advanced Distributed Learning Services Exercise
Evaluation Course, Major Command (MAJCOM) specific criteria, and installation-specific
criteria. Topics include an overview of the Air Force EM program, team member roles and
responsibilities, the Air Force Incident Management System, exercise planning, coordination,
ground rules, scripting, conduct, evaluation, reports, and analysis.

1.3. The EET Chief, with the assistance of 439 MSG/CEX and EET members, will plan and
conduct exercises to evaluate the capabilities of the 439 AW in supporting all local and higher
headquarters tasking.
2. Concept of Operations.
2.1. EET members are critical to the success of the exercise and evaluation program. Selected
by unit commanders from their most qualified personnel and acting as exercise "Trusted
Agents", they directly assist the EET Chief by identifying, planning, and arranging discrete
exercise events within their respective area of expertise. The EET members, utilizing their
knowledge of command emphasis areas and guidelines, aid the EET Chief in setting overall
exercise objectives. In the exercise planning stage, they interact with the EET Chief to build the
exercise and establish a workable exercise timetable, or schedule of events.
2.2. During the exercise, the EET members execute scheduled events at the direction of the EET
Chief and evaluate the resultant response. They also coordinate with other EET members during
exercise execution to ensure exercise events do not impede the overall exercise schedule.
Necessary exercise adjustments are made in coordination with the EET Chief. The EET may
also instruct and make on-the-spot corrections as necessary to enhance the exercise's training
value. Their evaluations and observations become the basis for the exercise critique and
ultimately the exercise evaluation report.
2.3. After the exercise, the EET must be able to provide participants with a true overall rating of
their performance. The EET must be prepared to justify and support all deficiencies discovered
during the evaluation. Based upon the EET evaluation of a particular plan, regulation, or
procedure, changes may be recommended to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) to
improve upon their product.
3. Duties.
3.1. Installation Commander assigns an EET Chief and directs each assigned and tenant unit to
appoint highly qualified personnel to become members of the EET. If a unit will have more than
one EET member, then the unit commander designates one member as the unit’s EET manager.
This gives the installation EET Chief one point of contact for that unit.
3.2. Installation Exercise Evaluation Team (EET) Chief is the point of contact for exercise
planning and coordinating and will:
3.2.1. Interface with higher headquarters such as Air Force Inspector General (IG) or Joint
Service Inspection teams, MAJCOM IG, and local community officials.
3.2.2. Prepare a localized Exercise Evaluation Program Operating Instruction.
3.2.3. Include tenant units and ensure they participate in the installation exercise program.
3.2.4. Coordinate with the Staff Judge Advocate, Public Affairs, local law enforcement
agencies, and civil governing authorities before conducting off-base exercises.
3.2.5. Train EET members.
3.2.5.1. Maintain a roster of EET members trained or requiring training and will monitor annual
training requirements for the EET members.
439AWI 10-2501 20 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                     3


3.2.5.2. Coordinate with the squadron or unit commanders to ensure enough EET personnel are
appointed and trained.
3.2.6. Ensure EET members required to drive special purpose vehicles or heavy equipment are
properly trained and certified in accordance with local guidelines before operating vehicles or
machinery.
3.2.7. Incorporate local communities as often as possible in installation EM exercises.
3.2.8. Using the Self Inspection Tracking System (SITS) provides a process for tracking and
resolving significant problems identified in higher headquarters inspections, installation
exercises, unit self-assessment, and real-world operations after-action reports.
3.2.8.1. SITS documents the problem, establishes accountability for corrections and monitors
corrective action through implementation and conclusion.
3.2.8.2. Use 439AW Form 22, SITS Discrepancy Sheet, as outlined in 439th Airlift Wing
Instruction 90-201, Self-Inspection Program.
3.3. EET Members:
3.3.1. Assist the EET Chief in planning, coordinating, and executing local exercises.
3.3.2. Attend all training courses required to improve evaluation skills.
3.3.3. Provide exercise objectives and recommended events for each exercise.
3.3.4. Obtain, prepare, and use exercise props and materials.
3.3.5. Provide evaluations, observations, and recommendations on each exercise to the EET
Chief within the predetermined time limits set by the EET Chief.
3.3.6. Ensure that the EET Chief is notified of any impending leave, TDY, or other absence
which may affect the evaluation of a scheduled exercise.
3.3.7. Work closely with the organizational commander to ensure that exercise objectives are
realistic and are a true test of the unit's capabilities.
3.3.8. Be knowledgeable of all plans, regulations, and other directives which tasks their
particular unit. Maintain current copies of checklists and other procedural directives to ensure a
thorough and unbiased evaluation. They will also evaluate these response checklists to determine
if checklist should be improved, updated, or additional items added.
4. Ground Rules.
4.1. Avoid stereotyping exercises. Vary exercise locations to increase realism and participation.
Thoroughly plan and design scenarios to create the stress and pressure that occurs in a real
disaster or attack situation.
4.1.1. Give required operational reports (voice and message) to the evaluators in writing. Do not
transmit these reports off base unless instructed to do so.
4.1.2. Do not recall people from leave or temporary duty. Complete all administrative forms and
give them to the evaluators.
4.1.3. When responding to an exercise, use warning lights but not sirens on emergency vehicles.
Use vehicle-mounted sirens or horns to announce withdrawal from the accident site.
4                                                         439AWI 10-2501 20 FEBRUARY 2009


4.1.4. Follow procedures in Air Force Joint Instruction (AFJI) 11-204, Operational Procedures
for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Materials, when simulating radio calls from aircraft carrying
dangerous material.
4.1.5. Use Technical Order 11N-20-11, General Fire Fighting Procedures, line numbers in
telephone, radio, and written communication during nuclear weapon accident exercises.
4.1.6. Conduct exercises in security areas. However, do not plan disaster exercises to simulate a
hostile or covert penetration of security areas.
4.1.7. Do not block alert force routes or runways and do not locate simulated accidents closer
than 1,000 feet (330 meters) to weapon-loaded aircraft.
4.1.8. Consider safety in all aspects of the exercise.
4.1.9. Restrict entry into facilities exempted from total evacuation to essential personnel and
people having legitimate business within the facility. Personnel who were conducting business
when evacuation was directed continue their business, but must remain in the facility until the
evacuation portion of the exercise is over. Check evacuation plans for exempted facilities and
question assigned personnel to make sure they know how to evacuate. Do not evacuate facilities
which, if shut down and restarted, would cause damage or generate considerable expense. One
person may be left in each evacuated facility for security/fire protection purposes. During
exercises involving simulated toxic materials or explosive hazards, place primary emphasis on
evacuation and protection of personnel and equipment. Do not evacuate the facilities below
without coordination:
4.1.9.1. Command posts, control centers, base operations dispatch desks, air traffic control
facilities, central security control, telephone switchboards, communications centers, and fire and
weather stations.
4.1.9.2. Alert aircraft, alert facilities, liquid oxygen and nitrogen plants, Petroleum, Oils and
Lubricants POL, hydrant facilities, computer rooms, and waste disposal facilities.
4.1.9.3. Hospital, clinic, and dental facilities.
4.1.9.4. Academic testing facilities when testing is in progress.
4.1.9.5. Security and law enforcement entry control points and posts.
4.1.9.6. Schools, nurseries, Base Exchange facilities, commissaries, credit unions, banks, post
offices, religious services, dining facilities, and military court facilities.
4.1.9.7. Munitions storage areas and navigational aid facilities.
4.1.10. Wear all individual protective training equipment, including protective masks, during
exercises. Exercise participants will not wear protective masks while driving a privately owned
vehicle. Protective masks will not be worn while driving a Government Owned Vehicle GOV
off-base.
4.1.11. Do not use major accident events conducted and evaluated as part of an attack response
exercise to meet major accident response exercise requirements.
4.1.12. Include the phrase "This is an exercise message." at the beginning and very end of all
written and verbal exercise communications.
439AWI 10-2501 20 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                     5


4.1.13. When using the installation warning system, tell the base populace, the surrounding
civilian population, and local civil authorities well in advance of the exercise.
4.1.14. General and special purpose vehicles and aerospace ground equipment located inside the
cordon must be moved outside the cordon.
4.1.15. Decrease the cordon size, if necessary, to keep accident response forces within the area
owned or controlled by the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) unit.
4.1.16. If utility shutdown is simulated, personnel must respond to the appropriate shutdown
location and demonstrate knowledge of proper facility shutdown procedures.
4.2. Ground Rules for Movement of Aircraft. All aircraft movement is simulated. Ground rules
for simulating aircraft movement include the following:
4.2.1. Taxi. Use the following procedures to obtain credit for the simulated taxi of an aircraft:
4.2.1.1. A minimum crew of one pilot, one co-pilot, one flight engineer, and one other crew
member (fire guard) for airlift units, must proceed to the aircraft and start a minimum of one
engine following technical procedures. Fighter units require one pilot and one crew chief.
4.2.1.2. The crew contacts the tower (command post or maintenance control may simulate tower
operations), announcing their tail number and the taxi route they are simulating. If the crew is
unaware of the proper route, obtain it from the tower (or simulated tower) or other personnel (on-
scene commander).
4.3.1. Towing. Use the following procedures to obtain credit for the simulated towing of an
aircraft:
4.3.1.1. Check aircraft to ensure it is capable of being towed.
4.3.1.1. Physically dispatch a tow crew (minimum of two qualified personnel) and an operable
tug and tow bar and attach to aircraft.
4.3.1.1. Release all tie-down restraints. Chocks remain in place.
4.3.1.1. One tow crew member must enter the cockpit and occupy the crew position to ride
brakes.
4.3.1.1. The tow crew then unhooks the tow bar and drives at tow speed along a designated route
to the dispersal area. The crew then returns to the disaster cordon to simulate towing of
additional aircraft, if required.
5. Exercise Preparation and Planning.
5.1. Exercises require thorough planning and preparation if all exercise objectives are to be
satisfied. Many exercise objectives are published within the basic regulation or directive
requiring the exercise. Other objectives may be determined locally by the unit commander
and/or based upon findings from previous exercises.
5.2. Exercise Sequence Planning.
5.2.1. The EET Chief determines and coordinates exercise planning requirements/date(s) based
on the complexity of the exercise. Exercise planning will incorporate all of the following with
either more or fewer meetings as required.
6                                                       439AWI 10-2501 20 FEBRUARY 2009


5.2.2. Meeting #1, is an initial planning effort to identify exercise objectives and concepts,
schedule times and dates for EET meeting, and establish OPRs for each scenario. Also, discuss
the probable scenario.
5.2.3. Meeting #2, EET members meet to develop scenarios and establish props required and
assign OPRs to obtain. EET members provide inputs (event cards) to the EET Chief and
exercise timing is established based on the scenario(s). Samples of inputs and exercise timing
are listed in Attachment 4.
5.2.4. Meeting #3, EET Chief publishes a draft of Master Scenario of Event Listing (MSEL) and
briefs to EET members. Also, adjust exercise schedule if needed and discuss previous findings.
The EET reviews the sequence to ensure all objectives are covered and that the exercise
challenges all participants.
5.2.5. Meeting #4, EET Chief gives pre-exercise brief, discuss limiting factors and give out
radios and call signs. Inputs cards are published and distributed to appropriate EET member.
Establish date for hotwash, and suspense evaluators for inputs.
5.3. Exercise Execution.
5.3.1. EET members should be in place at their evaluation posts as directed by the EET Chief.
For exercises requiring Fire Department and/or Tower involvement, these evaluators must be in
place 30 minutes before exercise start to formally notify the Fire and Tower chiefs. This is
required to ensure that agencies can identify response forces and retain an actual force for real
time emergencies.
5.3.2. Any deviations to the published timing sequence must be approved by the EET Chief.
Requests for simulations or exercise exemptions must be approved by the EET Chief.
5.3.3. Safety will not be compromised during any exercise and each EET member must be
constantly attuned to potential unsafe actions by exercise players. The exercises may be placed
on hold for unsafe actions observed by any EET member. In this case, the EET Chief must be
notified immediately.
5.3.4. Actual emergencies occurring during the exercise may be cause to terminate or place the
exercise on hold status. This determination will be finalized by the EET Chief and responding
units (normally the Fire Department).
5.3.5. Minor errors discovered and corrected by players may be mentioned in the report as a
REPEAT but will not be used as a finding. Remember, exercises are training situations during
which the players can fine tune their actions; do not fault players for actively playing the game
and making minor errors that could be corrected on the spot.
5.4. After-Exercise Actions.
5.4.1. The EET chief will schedule a hotwash to follow the exercise.
5.4.2. EET members will meet for the exercise hotwash. All events will be covered and any
findings, observations, and recommendations will be validated.
5.4.3. Player validation will include all exercise main events with findings, observations, and
recommendations of the appropriate event. Players have the option to request full justification
on findings that they feel are questionable.
439AWI 10-2501 20 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                7


5.4.4. Grading Criteria. Exercises are no-fault or training oriented. The wing commander has the
option to require ratings.
5.4.5. Reports and Analysis. Exercise reports may be in any format but must identify the type of
exercise, summarize the scenario, identify findings, assign offices of primary and collateral
responsibility, assign a suspense for replies, and list ratings (if used). Suspense times for
critiques, reports, and replies are determined locally. The EET chief analyzes individual and
collective exercise reports to identify recurring or common deficiencies and reports to the
readiness council. Identify recurring deficiencies in the exercise report and use them as
objectives in future exercises. Observations/Discrepancies will be tracked in the wing SITS
program and as part of the unit self-assessment program.

A MSEL (pronounced mee-zul) is typically used in operations-based exercises and contains a
chronological listing of the events that drive exercise play. The MSEL links simulation to action
and reflects each inject or event that will prompt players to implement the policy or procedure
being validated. MSEL entries that controllers must simulate are called injects.

6. ORM
All EET members must attend the mandatory safety meeting the day prior to the exercise. The
final MSEL will be distributed at the safety meeting and final assignments will be determined.
EET members will observe all a phases of the exercise from their functional area and any other
areas assigned. The following items will be closely observed:
Chalking vehicles
Traffic control
PPE
Stop exercise transmit “KNOCK IT OFF” might be followed with “Real World Emergency”
To stop a small localized problem use the term “TIME OUT”
Include “THIS IS AN EXERCISE MSG” at beginning and end of all transmissions
7. Notes from the EET Chief
The exercise will begin at approximately 0750 and will be facilitated by the EET Chief and
Emergency Management Staff.
When the exercise moves into the recovery phase and the “players” can provide a comprehensive
plan to complete the recovery, the EET Chief will terminate the exercise.
It is expected that the exercise will be terminated NLT 1130 local.
A Hot Wash will be conducted at 1300 at the Conference Center.
A final report will follow which includes areas of concern and items placed in SITS for tracking
and follow-up.
8. Observations/Recommendations

(1.) Observation: (AW/CV) Activation of the CAT was confusing. Better communications
between CP and wing as to when the CAT was activated. Crash occurred at 0900 and CAT was
activated at approx. 0945. (OPR: CP & AW/CCE     OPEN)
Recommendation: None
(2.) Observation: (CAT Exec) CAT activation is a joint exercise between CP and Wing HQ
staff. (This is basically the same as #1.)
Recommendation: When the secondary crash is activated Wing HQ staff assumes full
responsibility to contact and brief CC or CV (actual or acting) on the situation. This helps in
facilitating CAT activation concurrently with EOC notification. After hours, all notification will
come via CP. (OPR: CP & AW/CCE            OPEN)

TIME: 0815
AGENCY: SFS EET
TO: 911
(Call 911 from the phone at Park) This is an exercise message; I say again this is an exercise
message! This is ____________________. There has just been a bad accident here at XXXX
Park. Some guy just ran his car into some other cars and then rammed into a group of people at
the pavilion. Then he got out of the car and shot two or three and then grabbed some officer and
it looks like he is headed toward the Club. Man, this is terrible! We need ambulances here fast!
Hurry! I’ve got to go see if I can help. We need some help down here fast. (Record the name of
the second party. Stay on the line, if requested, to answer only a couple of questions, then hang
up quickly, saying you must offer help.) This has been an exercise message.
