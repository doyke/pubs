SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision includes scheduling requirements for AFISRA Project Officers overseeing projects
within the AFISRA compound (paragraph 1.8), and minor administrative changes.
1. Policy.
     1.1. The facility escort program facilitates miscellaneous maintenance, repairs and deliveries
     in buildings 2000 and 2007 by uncleared personnel. Success of the program requires the
     combined efforts of unit commanders/staff office directors, unit/staff office facility escort
     monitors, the Facility Management Office (FMO), the Facility Escort Program Manager
     (FEPM), and facility escorts.
     1.2. The FMO is responsible for maintenance of buildings 2000 & 2007 and the FEPM
     program for those facilities.
     1.3. Facility escorts will accompany all uncleared vendors, contractors, and maintenance
     workers who perform renovations, construction, installations, and service requirements in
     common areas of Buildings 2000 and 2007. Examples of escort duty requirements in
     common areas are lawn maintenance, ATM machine, air conditioning/heater maintenance,
     etc. Project escorts are provided by unit/staff offices the project is being accomplished for.
     Escorts will maintain positive control and constant surveillance of uncleared personnel while
     in the SCIF. The number of individuals a facility escort can escort at one time is based on
     the known trustworthiness of the visitors and the ability of the facility escort to reasonably
     control. The number escorted visitors will not exceed eight persons per escort official at any
     time.
     1.4. Facility escort personnel will not support modular furniture installation or office moves.
     Individual unit/staff offices will provide escorts for visitors required for their own projects, to
     include, but not be limited to, renovations, construction, installations, and service
     requirements. The number of escorts required for an individual office project may not be
     subtracted from the number tasked for general facility escorts.
     1.5. Unit/staff offices will provide facility escorts as tasked by the FEPM. Taskings are
     based upon: personnel in the grades of E-6 and below and GG-07/or equivalent DCIPS pay
     band or below who possess either an AFISR 325 (Green Picture) or AFISR 326 (Red Picture)
     badge whose primary place of duty is within building 2000 or 2007. Personnel exempt from
     the strength report are listed in paragraph 1.7.6. Facility escorts are at the discretion of the
     unit/staff office and may be military or civilian in any grade. Escort duty is not restricted to
     the grade levels used to determine quotas. Strength reports are submitted by appointed
     unit/staff office escort monitors to the FEPM. It is the responsibility of the unit escort
     monitor to ensure accurate and timely information is reported.
     1.6. Facility escorts that possess a AFISRA 325, Green Picture badge may escort anywhere
     within the confines of the building 2000 and 2007 compound. Escorts with an AFISRA 326,
     Red Picture badge may escort in the exterior restricted area outside of buildings 2000 and
     2007. They may also escort in building 2000 lobby area or by entering through the courtyard
     doors into the Heritage Center as far as the Army & Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES)
     cafeteria and back out. Escorts possessing a red entry badge will not enter in other hallway
     of building 2000. Note: Escorts tasked to perform escort duties in possession of a temporary
AFISRAI31-105 18 JULY 2012                                                                      3


  badge may not escort visitors and will require a replacement to be assigned by the unit escort
  monitor.
  1.7. Duty hours.
     1.7.1. Day shift facility escort duty hours for military members are 0700 - 1600, or until
     released by the FMO, whichever is later for military members. Duty hours for unit
     civilian escorts are their normal duty hours; they will remain available for duty for eight
     hours, plus a lunch break. Full-time escorts will relieve detailed escorts upon completion
     of their current escort duties. The FEPM will make every attempt to ensure facility
     escorts are not on duty for an extended period of time. Last minute or emergency facility
     escorting during non-duty hours will be handled on a case-by-case basis. All hours of
     duty are subject to change without notice if mission requires it.
     1.7.2. Evening facility escort duty hours are based on the needs of the uncleared visitors
     and last until escorted personnel depart the compound for the evening. Evening escorts
     will report to the FEPM NLT 1400 of the day assigned. The FEMP will provide the
     escort with the reporting instructions for that evening. If at the time of reporting there is
     no scheduled work, the evening escort will remain on standby status until 0600 hours of
     the next day. Generally, evening escort duty hours should not extend past 12 hours, or
     substantially beyond midnight, but are subject to the needs of the uncleared visitor.
     Civilian employees will not be made to work after duty hours unless the employee agrees
     to the hours and the unit scheduling the civilian employee will pay for the extra hours
     worked.
     1.7.3. Weekend facility escort duty hours are from 0700 and will last until escorted
     personnel depart the compound for the day. Actual hours will be based upon the needs of
     the contractor. Weekend escort hours should not extend substantially beyond 1930 hours.
     Civilian employees will not be made to work on weekends unless the employee agrees to
     the hours and the unit scheduling the civilian employee for weekend escort will pay
     overtime for the extra hours worked.
     1.7.4. Facility escort duty is a mandatory formation for military personnel and all quotas
     will be filled as tasked. Unit commanders/staff office directors will be notified by memo
     when their personnel sign in late or fail to report.
     1.7.5. Uniform requirement for military escorts will be the ABU. Civilians are
     encouraged to wear casual clothing that takes into account environmental and safety
     factors for tasks being assigned.
     1.7.6. The unit commander or staff director may exempt the following individuals from
     their monthly unit/staff office strength reports: shift workers, honor guard members,
     personnel who have not been issued a green or red picture entry badge, personnel on
     temporary duty (TDY) more than 15 consecutive days, personnel on leave more than 15
     consecutive days, military personnel that possess a medical profile which precludes them
     from performing escort duties. All organizations providing facility escorts are required to
     maintain an organizational spreadsheet or other document as indicated in paragraph 2.3.7.
     1.7.7. Requests from escort monitors for exemption for reasons other than those stated in
     paragraph 1.7.6 must be submitted in writing, with appropriate justification, to the
 4                                                               AFISRAI31-105 18 JULY 2012


        Director of Staff (AFISRA/DS). Note: Exemptions, if approved, are allowed only on a
        temporary basis.
        1.7.8. The Civilian Escort Program was approved by the Commander, AFISRA and
        provides seven civilian employees assigned to the FMO for full-time facility escort
        functions within the common areas of buildings 2000 and 2007. Escort taskings will be
        assigned to these employees first then additional escort requirements are assigned to
        military/civilian escorts designated by each organization in accordance with this
        instruction.
     1.8. Requesting Escort Support.
        1.8.1. Project Managers that oversee projects within the common areas of the AFISRA
        compound requiring escort support will provide at least 30 days advanced notice to the
        FEMP. Requests will include project timeline, scope of work, and contractor duty hours
        to allow the FEMP to determine the number of escorts required and develop a schedule
        accordingly.
        1.8.2. For projects of long duration (i.e. one week or longer), project managers will
        provide weekly work schedules at least one week in advance. Any deviations from
        schedules already submitted to the FEPM may result in limited escort availability.
        Project managers must notify the FEPM of any changes to the work schedule
        immediately.

       environment, the escort should bring the uncleared visitors back to the FMO in an
       attempt to resolve the situation.
       2.4.6. When performing facility escort duty, lunch breaks will correspond with personnel
       being escorted. If the escorted personnel do not stop for lunch, contact the FMO to
       request a replacement to be sent. If unable to contact the FMO, return escorted personnel
       to the FMO for a replacement.
       2.4.7. At the end of assigned duty all issued equipment will be returned to the FMO.
       Entry credentials for uncleared visitors will be returned to the issuing agency. If the
       FMO is closed, facility escort personnel will maintain possession of the equipment issued
       and return it to the FMO the next duty day. Missing/damaged equipment may result in
       the unit being held responsible for replacement costs. Note: Equipment and entry
       credentials will not be left with Security Forces personnel at the entry control point.

       time personnel under escort attempt to gain entry into areas they are not authorized or
       cannot be controlled, declare an emergency situation and have personnel in the
       immediate area contact Security Forces.
