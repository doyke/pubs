This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 41-2, Medical Support. This instruction
establishes policies and procedures for obtaining approval for and conducting user tests of
medical supplies and equipment. By following these guidelines, the 59th Medical Wing (59
MDW) activities interested in conducting user tests will avoid violating the Federal Acquisition
Regulation, provide for adequate in-servicing of the products under evaluation, and protect 59
MDW from product liability during the test. This publication applies to all personnel assigned,
attached or under contract to the 59 MDW. This instruction does not apply to the Air National
Guard or Air Force Reserve. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication
to the Office of Primary Responsibility using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual 33-363, Management of Records,
and disposed of IAW Air Force Records Information Management System Records Disposition
Schedule.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Updated unit and facility names. A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised material.
1. General.
   1.1. User tests are meant to determine whether an item meets the needs of a specific activity.
   Often, it is difficult to ascertain the effectiveness and functionality of an item based solely on
   the product literature. In those instances, it is necessary to conduct a user test.
 2                                                             59MDWI41-205 16 August 2007


     1.2. User tests are often time consuming and expensive. Consequently, their use should be
     reserved for equipment and supply acquisitions involving multiple users, extensive operating
     and maintenance expenditures, or complex products requiring detailed training and in-
     servicing.
2. Exclusions.
     2.1. Products under development by a manufacturer and not available for purchase are
     prohibited from being user tested unless the test is a part of a research project approved by
     the Office of the Surgeon General.
     2.2. Arrangements established with vendors in which equipment is provided to the hospital
     at no cost when we agree to purchase consumable supplies with the equipment, are not user
     tests. Such agreements are established only by contracting officers authorized to act on
     behalf of the government. Refer these types of requests to the Acquisitions Section of
     Medical Materiel Flight.
3. Statement of Understanding (SOU) (Attachment 3). The SOU must be completed before
taking possession of equipment or supplies for a user test. It may be possible to preclude a user
test by reviewing the manufacturer’s literature on equipment models to determine whether they
meet the user’s minimum essential characteristics. Care should be taken to ensure that informal
user tests are not abused. User tests are not a convenient or rapid means to circumvent the
acquisition process. These tests should be used only on a temporary basis (generally 30 days or
less and should not exceed 90 days).
4. Testing.
     4.1. In order for a user test to be valid the user must submit the request to the Medical
     Equipment Management Office (MEMO) for it to be routed and approved by 802nd
     Contracting Squadron before the delivery and start date of the test can be arranged with the
     vendor.
     4.2. If equipment is to be tested, MEMO notifies Biomedical Equipment Maintenance about
     when the vendor will deliver the equipment. Upon arrival, and prior to beginning the user
     test, a biomedical equipment maintenance technician inspects the equipment and signs the
     SOU. During the initial inspection, the biomedical equipment maintenance technician will
     identify whether the item to be tested is covered by the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990. If
     so, the vendor will be responsible for making appropriate notifications to ensure compliance
     with the act and will provide Logistics with copies of the notification letters.
     4.3. The vendor is responsible for training all test site users on the operation of the
     equipment. The coordinator maintains a list of attendees.
     4.4. The test is conducted with the product evaluation documentation annotated during the
     test.
     4.5. If equipment or a durable supply has been tested, the coordinator arranges for return of
     the item or items to the vendor, and prepares a return document following each test
     (Attachment 2). The coordinator delivers the return document to MEMO.
5. Purchase. If a decision is made to purchase the equipment or supply item after the user test,
the designated custodian works with MEMO to prepare a complete equipment request package.
