     Program, prior to commencing activities. All RMs for explosive exercises will meet all
     criteria in AFI 90-901 and AFMAN 91-201. RMs are not required if test and exercise
     operations are covered under a range standard operating procedure and/or an explosive safety
     site plan. Based on mission requirements, assess risks to people, equipment, facilities, and
KIRTLANDAFBI91-203 30 AUGUST 2012                                                                 7


   the environment. Identify and implement control measures to mitigate risks to an acceptable
   level. Includes organizations performing maneuvers, compass training, etc; this includes
   activities that are not using explosives.
   2.2. All organizations conducting test and evaluation programs will coordinate RM
   assessments through organizational directors and submit to 377 ABW/SEW for review; 377
   ABW/SEW will forward to 377 ABW/SEG for review of ground issues and then to the
   appropriate level for approval. RM assessments must be maintained as a “living document”
   by the user, and updated as necessary, throughout the life cycle of the test, evaluation
   program, or training exercise. Approved RMs well, once approved and signed by the
   Commander, will be forwarded to and maintained by 377 ABW/SEW.
3. Test Restrictions.
   3.1. Fire Danger: Operations during Very High and Extreme fire danger conditions will be
   evaluated and conducted based upon mission requirements and impact (see Attachment 1).
   An RM will be submitted to 377 ABW/SEW for review. Tests with high probability of
   starting a fire will not be conducted if sustained winds are over 25 Miles per Hour (MPH)
   during Very High and Extreme fire danger without taking approved measures to prevent the
   wild fire. Review will include 377 MSG/CEF.
   3.2. Low Visibility: Class IV or V tests will not be conducted when visibility is less than 5
   nautical miles (5.75 statute miles) or the ceiling is less than 1,000 feet above the highest
   altitude of expected fragmentation at the test site. No projectile is to enter any cloud
   formation because overcast or heavy cloud cover could conceal an aircraft.
   3.3. Meteorological Conditions: Class IV or V tests will not be conducted when
   meteorological conditions favor sound wave propagation that could be hazardous to
   personnel or cause property damage. All test agencies will perform evaluation of sound-wave
   propagation conditions. Contact base weather office, 846-9707, for information.
   3.4. No-Burn Days: Applicable from 1 October through end of February each year. Refer to
   the      City      of      Albuquerque         Air       Quality  web       site      at

   Environmental Sustainability Compliance (377 MSG/CEANC) for information regarding
   No-Burn days prior to conducting all outdoor explosive tests.
   3.5. Spotters: will be used for all Class I through VI tests, sled track tests, and training
   exercises where explosives items are used. Spotters will have communications with the
   project officer or test coordinator. Suspend or terminate test activities if personnel, vehicles,
   or aircraft approach or enter the hazard area.
   3.6. Outdoor Combat Arms Training and Maintenance (CATM) Range East (M-60) Range:
   Due to the remote location and limited access for firefighting operations, the following
   restrictions are established on the CATM Range East:
       3.6.1. Tracer ammunition will not be fired at any time.
       3.6.2. Organizations will provide ammunition stock numbers (if not on the unit’s 377

will be approved on a case-by-case basis. Submit requests via approved electronic format to 377
ABW/SEW for review and submittal to the CFAC. (377ABW.CFAC@KIRTLAND.af.mil).
Schedule changes need to be submitted by 0800 the day before for review and approval. Submit
any new test or operations at a minimum of three duty days prior to the event for review and
approval.
7. Chestnut Test Site Procedures. The formal cooperation outlined herein specifically
addresses scheduling of range, test site preparations, test bed locations, notification of testing,
Safety, Security, post-test clean-up and overall test coordination among parties involved. Use of
Chestnut Test Site will be in compliance with this instruction and the requirements set forth in
the Memorandum of Understanding between the 377 Air Base Wing, The Department of Energy,
The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), and the Air Force Research Laboratory
(AFRL).
   7.1. Range Scheduling. The AFRL/RDOT Test Office will be the central point of contact
   for scheduling all tests conducted on Chestnut Test Site. This is to include work performed
   by contractors on test and non-test days. Agencies are required to provide a POC and an
   escort for contractor personnel working on the range. The responsible test organization must
   also schedule their activity with Controlled Firing Area Committee.
 10                                                KIRTLANDAFBI91-203 30 AUGUST 2012


   7.2. Test Site Preparations. Coordinate with AFRL/RDOT and 377 ABW/SEW prior to
   accomplishing any site surveys, preliminary tests, construction, demolition, installation,
   demonstration or exercise activity. Any major improvements or long term planning for
   structures, targets or assets must be coordinated with AFRL/RDOT and 377 ABW/SEW
   annually.
       7.2.1. Digging and hot work permits must be obtained from the appropriate 377 ABW
       organization prior to performing those activities. Installation or construction of
       permanent occupied facilities is not authorized.
       7.2.2. Prior to the start of any test series all plans and drawings (electronic and hardcopy)
       will be presented to AFRL for review/approval. This requirement will eliminate planning
       of actions that are not permitted on the range or conflict with another test series.
   7.3. Test Site Locations. Three criteria will be considered when choosing a test location on
   Chestnut Range. They are:
       7.3.1. The proposed action at the selected location must be consistent with the
       Environmental Assessment for the area.
7.3.2. The air blast, fragmentation, ground shock, or ejecta from the proposed action must not
damage surrounding unprotected buildings, subject personnel to possible injury, damage optics
at Starfire Optical Range (SOR), or misalign heliostats at the Solar Power facility.

       7.3.3. The proposed location must have a suitable geology for the test. See Attachment
       4 for test site locations.
   7.4. Safety. Test organizations must prepare and submit a safety operating plan (SOP) and
   RM/hazard analysis for each explosive operation to AFRL/RDOT and to 377 ABW/SEW.
   The parties involved will comply with all applicable DoD and AF safety regulations and
   standards, in addition to the following safety responsibilities.
       7.4.1. The Organization conducting tests will ensure all personnel are evacuated to a safe
       location at time of detonation or when required by specific test SOP.
       7.4.2. Personnel evacuated will not reenter the evacuation zone until the organization
       conducting the test has given an all-safe notification.
   7.5. Post-Test Clean-up. Each test organization is responsible for cleaning up the test bed at
   the conclusion of the test series. Test structures, targets or assets left in place beyond one
   year must be justified and approved by AFRL/RDOT and 377 ABW/SEW. The location and
   use of all existing test structures must be identified to AFRL/RDOT by 30 Sep (annually)
   with expected completion dates or cleanup dates. This will help reduce remediation costs if
   the range ever becomes inactive and requires clean-up. No hazardous wastes/ammunition
   residues, etc., will be left at any test site on KAFB property. Clean-up must occur after each
   single event or at the end of a series of events on the same day. Residues cannot be left
   overnight.
   7.6. Overall Coordination.
KIRTLANDAFBI91-203 30 AUGUST 2012                                                          11


     7.6.1. Overall coordination and test notification will be IAW KAFBI 91-203. Proper
     overall coordination efforts are needed to ensure safety and efficient management of test
     programs.
     7.6.2. When conducting a test program where the clear zone, fragmentation zone or a
     directed energy type test overlaps into a different range or area, the Test Director will
     coordinate directly with the affected personnel. This will ensure timely and efficient
     communications are made which will enhance safety and overall test operations.
     7.6.3. The principal parties shall meet as required to discuss the operations to date,
     problems encountered, and ways to improve the test operations in the future.
     7.6.4. Modification or changes to the range must be coordinated and approved through
     377 ABW/SEW and AFRL/RDOT.

Controlled Events—Any operation other than explosives or directed energy tests that require
personnel or equipment to be within or near a Controlled Firing Area. Includes training
maneuvers, environmental surveys, and flight operations.
Controlled Firing Area (CFA)—Any open outdoor area where tests and/or training exercises
are conducted within the boundaries of KAFB.
Controlled Firing Area Committee (CFAC)—Representatives of units and agencies that
routinely use test or training areas or direct tests on KAFB.
Controlled Tests (CT)—Any explosives or directed energy tests or experiments, explosives
disposal operations, or field explosives demonstrations, conducted on KAFB that may create a
visual or sound disturbance or hazard to personnel, equipment, structures, or aircraft flying in the
area.
Coordinating Agency—Agency responsible for processing the advance written notifications
and ensuring there are no conflicts between agencies conducting Controlled Tests or Controlled
Events. The 377th Air Base Wing Weapons Safety office (377 ABW/SEW) is the coordinating
agency for all Department of Defense (DoD) and National Nuclear Security Administration
(NNSA)/Department of Energy (DOE) organizations including DoD and DOE contractors who
use the CFA.
Directed Energy Tests—Any outdoor that involves laser or high power microwave energy.
Fire Danger Rating—Fire danger level takes into account current and antecedent weather, fuel
types, and both live and dead fuel moisture. Potential fire hazards established daily by Sandia
Ranger District of the US Forestry Service: http://www.fs.fed.us/land/wfas/wfas23.html.
Note: Sandia Ranger District of the U.S. Forestry Service recommends KAFB (to include
withdrawn area) to be one level above the Cibola National Forest Fire Danger Rating. KAFB
will never be at a low Fire Danger Rating.
Moderate/High— Restricts fires and smoking to developed test sites. Use of pyrotechnics or
Blank/SIM       ammunition will be permitted on the developed test sites in approved
sandbagged/pitted areas and on the black-top of “No Sweat Boulevard”; vehicles are restricted to

approved sandbagged/pitted areas; vehicles are restricted to paved or graded roads. “Burn Site”
testing that emits embers with sufficient thermal capacity to start a fire outside of the cleared
facility area is not allowed. Welding operations restricted to areas cleared of weeds and other
materials capable of burning, to 35 feet.
Extreme— Restricts fires, smoking and pyrotechnics. Use of pyrotechnics will be approved on
a case-by-case basis to meet critical mission requirements. “No Sweat Boulevard” is off limits to
everyone (even if they are not using pyrotechnics) unless specifically authorized by the
Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Sandia Site Office. Suspend
non-essential testing operations. No testing at Burn Site that emits embers with sufficient
thermal capacity to start a fire outside of the cleared facility area. Welding operations restricted
to indoor areas or areas that have been shielded by partitions or welding drapes.
HOLD Condition (Delay): Problem requires more than 60 minutes but can be corrected
during the scheduled date—test will be placed in a delay status, run applicable telephone
notification checklist.
KAFB Test and Training Site—Areas identified within the boundaries of KAFB where
explosives, laser, and microwave energy research and development testing, training maneuvers,
or weapons qualifications are conducted (See Attachment 6).
Manzano Mountain Controlled Firing Area (MMCFA)—The airspace designated to contain
activities that if not conducted in a controlled environment could be hazardous to
nonparticipating aircraft. CFAs provide a means to accommodate, without impact to aviation,
certain hazardous activities that can be immediately suspended if a nonparticipating aircraft
approaches the area. The responsibility lies totally with the CFA user to terminate activities so
that there is no impact on aviation (a dedicated spotter will meet this requirement.) There is no
requirement for nonparticipating aircraft to avoid the airspace, nor are any communications or
Air Traffic Control separation requirements imposed.
Misfire— A misfire occurs when the explosives fail to detonate or partially detonates. An
electrical misfire will not be approached for at least 30 minutes after power has been supplied to
explosive components. When non-electrical misfires occur, a 1-hour wait time will be observed
from the expected detonation or ignition time.
Net Explosive Weight— The total quantity expressed in pounds, of explosives material or
pyrotechnics in each item or round; will be expressed in trinitrotoluene (TNT) equivalency.
Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)—A notice containing information (not known sufficiently in
advance to publicize by other means) concerning the establishment, condition, or change in any
component (facility, service, or procedure of, or hazard in the National Airspace System), the
timely knowledge of which is essential to personnel concerned with flight operations. NOTAM
(L) provides local dissemination by voice and other means, such as e-mail and telephone, to
satisfy local user requirements.
Risk Management (RM)/System Safety Review—The systematic process of identifying
hazards, assessing risk, analyzing risk control options and measures, making control decisions,
implementing control decisions, accepting residual risks, and supervising/reviewing the activity
for effectiveness. It is a living document that will be updated and changed annually or as
applicable. (Contact 377 ABW/SEW for assistance.)
