Chapter 1           Introduction to the Infrastructure
                    Support Element
1.1   Organization and            The Operations Flight is responsible for all activities re-
      Function                    quired to operate, maintain, repair, and construct installa-
                                  tion real property. The flight is composed of five elements
                                  to process requirements in an efficient and timely manner.
                                  These elements are Maintenance Engineering, Facility
                                  Maintenance, Material Acquisition, Infrastructure Support,
                                  and Heavy Repair.

                                  Volume 5, Infrastructure Support is a guide to the mission,
                                  objectives, and management of the Infrastructure Support
                                  Element of the Operations Flight. With few exceptions, In-
                                  frastructure manages and operates all exterior infrastructure
                                  systems beyond the five-foot building line and the various
                                  utilities and plant operations. The pamphlet offers guidance
                                  by suggesting options and tools to successfully perform the
                                  mission. Successful alternatives to these suggestions are
                                  encouraged and authorized.

                                   for all infrastructure activities and systems.

1.3.3   Recurring Work             A major task for the Infrastructure Support Element is the
        Program                    accomplishment of the recurring work program (RWP) for
                                   the base utility plants and systems. The recurring work pro-
                                   gram's unique value is in the savings that can be achieved
                                   by periodic, scheduled maintenance of equipment and util-
                                   ity systems. Its major purpose is to maximize the life ex-

                                  mize operating effectiveness and reliability. Recurring
                                  work is accomplished by the utilities work centers with
                                  technical assistance from the Maintenance Engineering
                                  Element.

1.3.4    Infrastructure           Development of long-range infrastructure programs re-
         Program                  quires the coordinated effort of the infrastructure program
                                  engineers in the Maintenance Engineering Element and the
         Management
                                  senior craftsmen/supervisor from the Infrastructure work
                                  centers. The program engineer(s), in conjunction with the
                                  expertise and knowledge available in the various Infra-
                                  structure work centers, is large tasked to develop a man-
                                  agement program to cover all long-range infrastructure
                                  utility and plant systems.

1.4     Manpower                  AFMS 44EO, Manpower Standard Operations Flight, de-
                                  tails the manning for the Operations Flight. Using the de-
                                  tailed formulas and determining the applicable manpower
                                  ranges, manpower managers can consult the Standard
                                  Manpower Tables provided in AFMS 44EO to identify the
                                  manning of the Infrastructure Support Element needs.

                                  While some command and base variations may make man-
                                  ning requirements unique, the Civil Engineer formed the
                                  original, typical Objective Squadron, Infrastructure Support
                                  Element template to provide overall guidance on the num-
                                  bers and types of Air Force specialties (AFS) authorized.
                                  The chief of the Infrastructure Support Element is a civilian
                                  position.

1.4.1    Training                 Manning levels and authorizations are based upon fully
                                  qualified personnel. The appropriate training prior to as-
                                  signment is essential for acceptable work performance.

1.4.2    Enlisted Workforce       The requirement for having a military workforce is to meet
                                  the wartime contingency taskings. Each MAJCOM has a
                                  military strength, which is distributed to each installation.
                                  There is some flexibility in the overall military-to-civilian
                                  mix based on the core AFS requirements (Attachment 2).

                                  Coordination with the MAJCOM and Resources Flight

                                   modifications to real property. This civilian work force:
                                   (1)    provides a higher level of career field knowledge to
                                          supplement the senior enlisted force;
                                   (2)    provides continuity and stability at the installation
                                          during contingency exercises and deployments of
                                          military personnel;
                                   (3)    has specific duties and responsibilities during base
                                          exercises, military deployments, and natural disas-
                                          ters/emergencies; and
                                   (4)    provides training to enlisted and other civilian per-
                                          sonnel.
                                   The local Consolidated Personnel Center and Labor Man-
                                   agement Agreement can give specific criteria for each of
                                   these instances. Most civilians hired are at the Journeyman
                                   level; however, in the future, they may be hired as appren-
                                   tices and intermediate level employees.

1.4.4    Multi-craft/Multi-        The multi-crafting and multi-skilling initiatives were estab-
         skilling Initiative       lished as part of the DMRD 967. The purpose was to en-
                                   hance the organization by gaining efficiency and produc-
                                   tivity. The intent of multi-crafting was to create teams of
                                   skilled craftsmen with the purpose of quickly completing
                                   work assignments. Both multi-skilling and multi-crafting
                                   included using military and civilian personnel.

1.5     Matrixing                  Productivity gains are achieved through matrixing. Ma-
                                   trixing is the movement of personnel within an element to
                                   support an identified shortage in a skill level, AFS, or spe-
                                   cialized work task. Inspection of specialized service con-
                                   tracts is one example where craftsmen are used to augment
                                   quality assurance evaluators (QAEs) in the Maintenance
                                   Engineering Element.

                                   The Working in the Operations Flight pamphlet is primar-

Chapter 2           Maintenance and Operation of the Base
                    Infrastructure Systems
                                  The Infrastructure Support Element is possibly the most
                                  critical and diversified element in the Civil Engineer Op-
                                  erations Flight. Plants and utility systems are the backbone
                                  supporting the Civil Engineers' primary mission; they must
                                  operate reliably at all times. Operation and maintenance
                                  (O&M) of the aging base utilities and plants is an on-going
                                  challenge. In 1995, the average age of all Department of
                                  Defense (DoD) facilities was 40 years, with 60 percent over
                                  35 years old. Over half of all facilities and supporting utili-
                                  ties had exceeded their normal design life. The Air Force
                                  has been unable to fully fund the proper maintenance of
                                  base facilities; infrastructure was often ignored.

2.1   Program                     The program engineers in the Maintenance Engineering
      Development                 Element are focal points and managers of the various infra-
                                  structure programs. They have ultimate responsibility for
                                  developing, prioritizing, and defending both the near- and
                                  long-term infrastructure programs. Craftsmen and techni-
                                  cians work with the program engineers to develop an in-
                                  ventory and condition assessment.

                                  The program engineer then evaluates the infrastructure
                                  system by component and types and determines the best
                                  management avenue for execution of the work. The re-
                                  quirements identified during the assessments — recurring
                                  work programs, work orders, or engineering projects in-
                                  cluding simplified acquisition of base engineering require-
                                  ments (SABER), O&M contracts, military construction
                                  projects (MCP), and indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity
                                  (IDIQ) delivery orders are developed into program activi-
                                  ties. The program engineer with inputs from the work cen-
                                  ters senior craftsmen considers the work’s priority, scope,
                                  method of execution, and funding avenues.

                                  The priority of the work — Does it need to be done now?
                                  What is the impact to the mission if it is delayed? What is
                                  the likelihood of system failure?

                                  The scope of the work — Who has the expertise to per-
                                  form the work? How big is the effort?

                                   The best method to execute — Can it be consolidated
                                   with other like work requirements? Will an expert be used?

                                   Funding avenues — When the work requirements have
                                   been developed into a program activity, the program engi-
                                   neer should prepare the work request, coordinate a short
                                   cost estimate with the work centers, track through the ap-
                                   proval process, and coordinate the execution priorities as
                                   appropriate.

2.2   Condition                    During 1994, AFMC published a complete set of standards
      Assessment                   for evaluating the condition rating for each Infrastructure
                                   Support Element. This pamphlet, the AFMC Infrastructure
                                   Condition Standards (ICS), divided the systems into com-
                                   ponents and into subcomponents. The condition evaluation
                                   was based on the zero to ten scale. This pamphlet gave a
                                   comprehensive definition of the numerical rating expected
                                   for each sub-component. Additionally, weighting factors
                                   were developed to roll up sub-component ratings into com-
                                   ponent ratings and component ratings into system ratings
                                   and project ratings.

                                   The ratings provide a means of comparison across the in-
                                   frastructure program and across programs for assigning
                                   priorities and funds. The generic format of the standards is
                                   shown in Table 1, Condition Standards.

                                   cating funds, the intention is for all projects to be priori-
                                   tized and accomplished consistent with FIM criteria. The
                                   FIM measures specific requirements and rates them ac-
                                   cording to their impact on the installation/tenant mission. It
                                   is essential that the condition of infrastructure systems is
                                   clearly tied to FIM criteria for mission impact.

2.2.2   Specialized Surveys        For most infrastructure, commercial specialists can assess
                                   the systems; objectively rate the components; and develop a

                                  cases, these contracts will alleviate manpower-intensive
                                  requirements when manning support is unavailable. The
                                  contractor can also provide critical technical expertise
                                  and/or systems not available at many bases (e.g., infrared
                                  roof evaluation systems). Regular assessment contracts
                                  should be considered for many programs. For example, the
                                  energy program recommends an Energy Conservation Op-
                                  portunity Analysis to support the program.

2.3   Plant Operation             The work centers in the Infrastructure Support Element op-
                                  erate the various utilities and plants assigned to them. The
                                  day-to-day operation of plants is accomplished as opera-
                                  tions work. The operations category of work allows plant
                                  operations to perform this work with minimal record keep-
                                  ing and with the degree of control and oversight desired by
                                  the supervisor. Generally, operations work is internally
                                  identified, approved, and performed with minimal tracking.
                                  Similar to the direct scheduled work order (DSWO), this
                                  method or work accomplishment does not require separate
                                  computer entries or paperwork for each item of work. Work
                                  is directly charged to operations and cost accounting done
                                  on a large scale only by utility or plant support.

                                  Operations of utility plants (such as, central heat boiler
                                  plants and sewage treatment facilities) require continuous
                                  monitoring to ensure compliance with national, state, and
                                  local agency environmental laws. State-certified plant op-
                                  erators must maintain currency in their field as prescribed
                                  by the appropriate agency or dictated by other regulatory
                                  directives. Written operating procedures should be devel-
                                  oped for all systems and be prominently displayed for
                                  ready reference by the plant operators.

                                  signed to the Operations Flight. To develop this field expe-
                                  rience and a cooperative, long-term working relationship,
                                  the Infrastructure Support managers and senior craftsmen
                                  should:
                                  (1)    meet regularly,
                                  (2)    develop documentation,
                                  (3)    classify work,
                                  (4)    strive to develop a good relationship with custom-
                                         ers, and
                                  (5)    ensure craftsmen are properly and adequately
                                         trained.
3.2.1   Work Type                 Requirements are initiated with necessary documentation
                                  used to establish the appropriate type of work order (Direct
                                  Scheduled or Planned Work).

3.2.1.1 Direct Scheduled          Direct Scheduled Work, previously referred to as job or-
        Work                      ders, is work that generally does not require detailed plan-
                                  ning. These work orders are small and require less than 50
                                  man-hours. Direct scheduled work is immediate or routine
                                  and can be maintenance, repair, or minor construction not
                                  requiring capitalization.

3.2.1.2 Immediate Work            Immediate work includes emergency and urgent direct
                                  scheduled work.

                                  Emergency work is work required to correct an emergency
                                  condition detrimental to the mission or reducing opera-
                                  tional effectiveness. It should be completed within 24 hours
                                  of notification. An emergency will always include, but is
                                  not limited to, failure of any utility, fire protection, envi-
                                  ronmental control, or security alarm system.

                                  Work that is not an emergency, but must be responded to
                                  and completed within five days after receipt of material is
                                  classified as urgent. Urgent work is usually done as a di-
                                  rect scheduled work order. Urgent requests might include
                                  broken windowpanes, inoperative faucets, missing roof
                                  shingles, or inoperative light switches.

3.2.1.3 Routine Work              Routine work is work that does not qualify as emergency or
                                  urgent work, but should be done to maintain the standards
                                  of an installation. Routine work should be completed
                                  within 30 calendar days or during the next scheduled cycle
                                  visit to the facility, unless materials are required. When
                                  practical, all routine requirements for a facility should be
                                  consolidated and grouped into a single work package,

                                   and performed during the next scheduled facility visit.

3.2.2   Work Classification        Work is classified as maintenance and repair (M&R) or an
                                   alteration.

                                   Maintenance and repair is work required to preserve or re-
                                   store an existing facility. Some examples of M&R are re-
                                   painting, replacing floor tile or light fixtures, and repairing
                                   heating systems. The regularly scheduled facility visits are
                                   used to check the condition of the utilities, floors, support
                                   structures, or various areas of a building.
                                                                 NOTE

                                   Minor construction, including alteration, means building a
                                   new facility or modifying, adding to, or otherwise altering
                                   an existing building. Some examples are installing new
                                   walls or lighting, relocating existing walls or real property
                                   installed equipment (RPIE), and cutting doorways. These
                                   projects are funded from operations and maintenance funds.

                                   Civil engineering will assign one of the following priorities
                                   to the work request, consistent with guidance in the Facility
                                   Investment Metric:
                                   (1)       Mission — Work in direct support of the overall
                                             base or tenant unit mission that, if not done, would
                                             reduce operational effectiveness.
                                   (2)       Safeguard Life and Property — Work needed to

                                  The Objective Squadron does not identify a separate plan-
                                  ning section. Planners are earned and authorized as part of
                                  the Journeyman-level crafts position description. Some CE
                                  squadrons have a formal planning section located in either
                                  the Heavy Repair or Maintenance Engineer Elements with

3.2.3   Coordination              The requester must coordinate with the appropriate agen-
                                  cies on work that requires CE action to eliminate or correct
                                  hazards. This coordination is critical to ensure compliance
                                  with prescribed building, safety, and environmental poli-
                                  cies, regulations, and criteria. Utility outages are often re-
                                  quired in order the accomplish repairs on utility systems
                                  and plants. It is imperative that these outages be publicized
                                  and fully coordinated.

3.2.4   Work Evaluations          Work orders go to the appropriate work center-of-execution
                                  for initial evaluation and rough estimate. The heavy repair
                                  force manager is usually the focal point for the Work Re-
                                  quest Review Board and manages the work orders. If the
                                  work order affects the base infrastructure (and almost all
                                  do), Maintenance Engineering and Infrastructure Support
                                  should evaluate the work order and recommend action.
                                  Following the Maintenance Engineering evaluation, the
                                  work order should go to the WRRB for final evaluation and
                                  approval or disapproval. The basic evaluation process an-
                                  swers a number of questions:

                                  Is this work consistent with long range plans? Is this
                                  work going to have a positive or adverse affect on the in-
                                  frastructure program? Have energy costs, additional HVAC
                                  load, roof penetrations, and pavement integrity been con-
                                  sidered?

                                  Is the work redundant? Is the work duplicating or negat-
                                  ing other planned work, especially the work in the long-
                                  range plans? Often mission requirements may drive a pro-
                                  grammed project to be executed earlier and is advantageous
                                  to the program.

                                  How should the work be executed? Is it an in-house work
                                  order, a contract project, an IDIQ project, a SABER proj-
                                  ect, or a small purchase effort? The cost estimate and type
                                  of work will impact this evaluation.

                                   Is the work approved/disapproved? Is the work valid?
                                   The engineer and facility maintenance manager should
                                   provide an approval or disapproval recommendation.

                                   There are many methods of establishing and executing
                                   work order programs. These programs were developed and
                                   intended to provide equitable support to all base customers,
                                   implement and execute dedicated commitment dates, and
                                   follow commanders’ priorities, and properly manage the
                                   workforce. A sound program improves the management of
                                   all CE resources.

Chapter 4           Recurring Work Program Support
4.1   Work Program                The recurring work program is a mission shared by all sec-
                                  tions in the Operations Flight. The Infrastructure Support
                                  Element work centers manage and execute the day-to-day
                                  program. The Material Acquisition Element maintains the
                                  appropriate stock (either in the CE supply store or forward
                                  stores/work center stocks) to support the program. The
                                  Maintenance Engineering Element oversees the develop-
                                  ment of the program and assessments of its elements by
                                  periodically reviewing the requirements of the recurring
                                  work program and making recommendations to improve its
                                  effectiveness, efficiency, and manpower requirements. Fig-

                                  lustrates this process for RPIE.

                                  The recurring work program RWP applies to all routine,
                                  redundant, recurring work involving real property, RPIE, or
                                  systems and other equipment maintained by CE. By defini-
                                  tion, its scope and frequency is well known, locations are
                                  well established, materials are available or not required, or
                                  it’s a recurring service. Work includes operations, service
                                  work, and preventative maintenance. The scope and level
                                  of effort is known.

4.2   Work Analysis               Some RWP will be service- or operations-related. Other
                                  work, such as flightline sweeping or snow-removal, is a
                                  service provided by the horizontal work center of the
                                  Heavy Repair Element and, typically, listed as a work item
                                  in the RWP. However, most RWP will be preventative
                                  maintenance work, such as periodically replacing belts and
                                  filters on HVAC equipment. This type of RWP often re-
                                  quires Maintenance Engineering analysis support and,
                                  therefore, a close working relationship among all elements
                                  of the Operations Flight is desired. For additional discus-
                                  sion on analysis of the recurring work program see

Chapter 5           Long-range Planning
5.1   Long-range                  The program engineers in Maintenance Engineering are the
      Infrastructure              managers of the various infrastructure long-range pro-
                                  grams. To make the programs work, the senior Infrastruc-
      Programs
                                  ture work center craftsmen must be involved in all facets of
                                  these programs. The craftsmen must support and be a team
                                  member of the facility evaluation group for the proper as-
                                  sessment of all assigned utility system and plants. Crafts-
                                  men should meet with the program engineers once or twice
                                  a month at a facility in conjunction with a 1219 inspection.
                                  The team performs a technical evaluation to include all In-
                                  frastructure Support Elements (HVAC, electrical, wa-
                                  ter/sewage). Deficiencies are identified, tagged, and an ap-

                                  quest, prepared and worked into the multi-year infrastruc-
                                  ture plans. The program engineer acts as the focal point for
                                  the program for organizing and managing the log and en-
                                  suring the requirements are closed out to the plans. The
                                  goal is to visit all major facilities in a year. The benefits of
                                  this team approach include mutual support and consulta-
                                  tion, synergy, team identification, and improved coordina-
                                  tion between engineer and work center technicians.

5.2   Major Programs              Most bases have a unique set of programs emphasizing re-
                                  gional, state, or command requirements. However, many
                                  programs are common throughout the Air Force and some
                                  are mandated. These programs cover the major utilities and
                                  plant systems and are in place at most bases:
                                  (1)     water and wastewater systems,
                                  (2)     HVAC systems and plants,
                                  (3)     refrigeration management,
                                  (4)     fire protection,
                                  (5)     electrical distribution,
                                  (6)     airfield lighting,
                                  (7)     corrosion control
                                          cathodic protection and
                                          protective coatings,
                                  (8)     industrial water treatment, and
                                  (9)     informal programs.
                                  The Infrastructure craftsmen and technicians must work
                                  closely with the Maintenance Engineering program manag-
                                  ers, focusing on assessments and inputs for the continual

5.2.1   Water and                  The water and wastewater systems program ensures this
        Wastewater Systems         critical utility keeps flowing. The programs are often di-
                                   vided into water supply systems (potable, non-potable, and
                                   fire suppression) and wastewater removal systems (sanitary
                                   and storm). Systems include the piping/channels, connec-
                                   tions, manholes, pumps and lift stations, and treatment
                                   plants. As the nation's conservation and environmental
                                   concerns grow, management pressures on these systems are
                                   expected to increase. Many communities have been pressed
                                   to upgrade their systems to reduce infiltration and inflow. A
                                   long-range plan for the upgrade of the systems will ensure
                                   the program engineer can support the increasing require-

        Plants                     includes all environmental systems: air conditioners, heat
                                   pumps, furnaces, boiler plants, central air conditioning
                                   (A/C) plants, and associated exterior distribution piping
                                   systems.

5.2.3   Refrigeration              Refrigeration management is a recent program. Bases use it
        Management                 as a tool to manage their dwindling inventory of critical
                                   refrigerants and develop appropriate plans for replacement
                                   of the equipment. Implementing an effective refrigeration
                                   management program means having or implementing an
                                   effective HVAC program.

5.2.4   Fire Protection            Infrequently, a base will require a fire protection engineer;
                                   usually, the mechanical engineer serves this purpose. The
                                   mechanical engineer, with system updates from the Infra-
                                   structure technicians, manages the base's fire protection
                                   systems to include the Aqueous Film Forming Foam
                                   (AFFF) systems in hangers, building sprinklers, status of
                                   fire extinguishers, emergency lighting and markings, and
                                   fire hydrants. The water and wastewater program engineer
                                   maintains the information on the hydrant system and the
                                   Fire Protection Flight maintains all remaining information
                                   to support this critical program.

                                  The electrical distribution program ensures that power (one
5.2.5   Electrical                of the primary mission utilities) continues to flow. The
        Distribution              electrical distribution system involves the base power
                                  plants, main feeders, substations, primary circuits, trans-
                                  formers, generators, power lines, and, often, the circuits to
                                  the building circuit boxes. Also included are support sys-
                                  tems such as oil pump stations. In recent years, polychlori-
                                  nated biphenyls (PCBs) and energy conservation have
                                  placed an increased emphasis on this program.

                                  The environmental impact of PCBs has required an inven-
                                  tory and replacement plan for all transformers using PCBs.
                                  PCB transformers must be treated as hazardous waste until
                                  purged. This plan should be jointly developed by the elec-
                                  trical systems work center and the program engineer and
                                  progress tracked through completion. An energy conserva-
                                  tion plan should be developed for employing efficient elec-
                                  trical components and metering the maximum number of
                                  users to allow analysis of energy problems.

5.2.6   Airfield Lighting         The crux of the base mission is the airfield. Supporting air-
                                  field lights and other visual air navigation systems is, there-
                                  fore, a primary concern of CE units. The systems include
                                  all substations, circuits, light systems, and vaults associated
                                  with lighting. The program engineer should also maintain a
                                  base lighting program to support those circuits and systems
                                  of both airfields and roads.

5.2.7   Corrosion Control         The annual corrosion cost in the US is estimated to be
                                  about $150 billion. The cost to the Air Force Civil Engineer
                                  is estimated at $500 million ($3-4 million at an average
                                  base; 1984 dollars). Controlling this corrosion is a primary
                                  concern of CE. Corrosion control programs usually consist
                                  of two primary components: cathodic protection and pro-
                                  tective coatings.

5.2.8   Cathodic Protection       Underground metal structures, primarily steel, corrode
                                  rapidly because they are exposed to many electrochemical
                                  environments. Cathodic protection is the system of provid-
                                  ing cathodic potential to the structure preventing the elec-
                                  trochemical corrosion. This can be done by sacrificial an-
                                  ode or the impressed current system.

                                  The sacrificial anode is a metal/alloy anode (electrochemi-
                                  cally more active than the structure) buried in the same un-
                                  derground environment and connected to the structure. The
                                  anode undergoes the corrosion and, at the same time, sends

                                   a current increasing cathodic potential of the structure, pre-
                                   venting corrosion of the structure.

                                   In the impressed current system, an external direct current
                                   (DC) power source provides a current to the structure and
                                   the surrounding environment. This current increases ca-
                                   thodic potential of the structure, preventing corrosion of the
                                   structure.
                                                            NOTE
                                      The DC power source transmits the current through
                                      expendable anodes. They corrode through this process
                                      and must be replaced.
5.2.9   Protective Coatings        The primary purpose of the protective coatings program is
                                   to separate the underground metal structure from the elec-
                                   trochemical environment. Along with the necessity to
                                   maintain this type of protective coatings program, the pro-
                                   gram engineer needs to maintain and manage a general
                                   protective coatings plan for all base structures.

                                   One other corrosion control method, less common but used
                                   throughout the Air Force, is environment alteration. This
                                   method alters the electrochemical environment by changing
                                   temperature and water levels and adding corrosion inhibi-
                                   tors or chemical catalysts to prevent the corrosion.

5.2.10 Industrial Water            The electrochemical effect, opposite of corrosion, on CE
       Treatment                   systems is scale buildup. This buildup normally occurs in
                                   systems using heated water or steam (for example, boilers,
                                   heat plants, hot water piping, cooling towers). Scale causes
                                   significant energy efficiency losses in the heating systems
                                   and can stress and deteriorate the systems in turn. CE pre-
                                   vents this scale by treating the industrial water used with
                                   scale inhibitors or chemicals to react with the scaling com-
                                   pounds. When there is a buildup of the scale, it is usually
                                   removed with acidic washes or physical chipping. The in-
                                   dustrial water treatment program engineer manages the
                                   treatment systems and scale removal.


5.2.11 Informal Programs           Many bases have small, informal programs to support base-
                                   specific concerns and initiatives. These programs are rarely
                                   regulated, but require some expert management. Most are
                                   managed either with a series of folders or a marked-up
                                   map. They are, rarely, supported with spreadsheets. Sys-
                                   tems included in general programs are the natural gas dis-
                                   tribution system, liquid fuels storage and distribution,

                                                                                    Chapter 5

                                  grounding and lightning protection, alarm systems, emer-
                                  gency generators, aircraft barrier systems, and backflow
                                  prevention.

                                  The program engineer, along with the responsible infra-
                                  structure technicians, should know the extent of the inven-
                                  tory, the condition of the systems, and the requirement for
                                  replacement. Environmental concerns such as underground
                                  and above ground fuel storage tanks; petroleum, oil, and
                                  lubrication (POL) delivery systems; and water treatment
                                  often require a detailed inventory, condition assessment,
                                  and long-range improvement plan. A program engineer or
                                  infrastructure technician usually manages these activities.

                                  Aircraft arresting barriers systems are maintained and man-
                                  aged in the power production work center and frequently
                                  require an engineer POC to provide liaison with the base
                                  Major Command (MAJCOM) and Air Staff leadership and
                                  advocate for program funds. The power production section
                                  is responsible for performing aircraft arresting system in-
                                  spection, maintenance, and repair in compliance with the
                                  frequency and direction provided by the technical orders
                                  (TO) for all systems at the base. AFI 32-1043, Managing
                                  Aircraft Arresting Systems, and ACCI 32-16, Operation

                                  national security) for the Air Force to exceed the
                                  statutory cost limits established in AFI 32-9001 relative

                                  approach lighting sites, communication sites, etc. A
                                  clearance easement, specifically, does not include the
                                  right of aircraft passage over the land, so the landowner
                                  may separately recover for loss of value to his or her
                                  land due to low and frequent flights of aircraft.

declaration of excess --           A narrative description of real property that is no
                                   longer required for foreseeable Air Force missions. The
                                   declaration contains an identification of the land, type
                                   of governmental real estate interest, facility inventory
                                   information, recommended disposal dates, re-use

                                   interfere with the purpose for which the easement was
                                   granted. An easement may be acquired for a specific
                                   term or in perpetuity. An easement differs from a
                                   license because: the privilege granted usually cannot be
                                   withdrawn during its term and it is considered to be a
                                   permanent interest in the property if the term exceeds
                                   one year.
emergency work --                  Work that must be accomplished immediately.
eminent domain --                  The right of the government to take private property for
                                   public use upon payment of just compensation.
Energy Conservation Investment     A Military Construction (MILCON)-funded program
Program (ECIP) --                  primarily intended for accomplishing energy
                                   conservation retrofits of existing buildings. It includes
                                   construction of new, high-efficiency energy systems
                                   and modernization of existing systems. ECIP is an
                                   OSD centrally-managed program.
Energy Savings Performance         Contracting with a private sector company for
Contract (ESPC) --                 completion of energy audits and installation of energy
                                   conservation projects. This provides a method to
                                   acquire energy conservation projects with no AF
                                   resources and without payment if savings do not result.
Energy Management Control System   The civil engineer energy control system that
(EMCS) --                          historically manages heating, ventilation, and air
                                   conditioning (HVAC) systems. It differs from direct
                                   digital control in that it includes both solid state
                                   systems and the older pneumatic systems.
engineers --                       Any engineer in Civil Engineer units to include the
                                   Base Civil Engineer, the Maintenance Engineer,
                                   program engineers, and project engineers.
environmental assessment --        A document, occurring early in the planning process,
                                   for evaluating the potential environmental impact of a
                                   proposed action. An assessment covers the same
                                   topical areas as an environmental impact statement
                                   (EIS), but with less detail. An assessment results in a
                                   decision that an EIS is necessary, or that the proposed
                                   action will have no significant effect, therefore, a
                                   finding of no significant impact (FONSI) can be made
                                   (AFI 32-7004).

                                      the proposal will be mitigated. It is prepared in two
                                      stages: a draft statement which is filed with the
                                      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and made
                                      available to the public for comment and a final
                                      statement which is revised to reflect comments made
                                      on the draft EIS (AFI 32-7004).

                                      retrofits of existing buildings or new construction plus
                                      energy audits, designs and metering programs. It
                                      includes construction of new, high-efficiency energy
                                      systems and modernization of existing systems.
fee ownership --                      Title to real property belonging to a person or the

                                   used to reduce administrative cost and buyer time for
                                   purchasing high usage items such as CEMAS store

value (current, fair, and estimated) --   As used in this regulation, these terms mean current
                                          fair market value or current fair market rental value, as
                                          appropriate. Fair market value is the amount in cash, or
                                          on terms reasonably equivalent to cash, for which the
                                          property would be sold by an owner, willing but not
                                          obliged to sell, to a purchaser who desires, but is not
                                          obliged, to buy. Fair market rental value of a property
                                          is the amount that, in a competitive market, a
                                          well-informed and willing lessee would pay and that a
                                          well-informed lessor would accept for the use and
                                          occupancy of the property for a particular term.
vault --                                  Storage location of base as-built and Base
                                          Comprehensive Plan drawings, so termed because
                                          many bases originally stored these drawings in a vault
                                          for physical security.
wetlands --                               Areas that are inundated by surface or ground water
                                          with a frequency sufficient to support, and under
                                          normal circumstances do or would support, a
                                          prevalence of vegetative or aquatic life that requires
                                          saturated or seasonally-saturated soil conditions for
                                          growth and reproduction. Wetlands generally include
                                          swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas such as mud
                                          flats, natural ponds, potholes, river overflows, sloughs,
                                          and wet meadows. Wetlands may be, but are not
                                          necessarily, located in floodplains (AFI 32-7005).
withdrawn land --                         Public land that has been set aside or designated for a
                                          specific public purpose, such as a national park,
                                          wildlife refuge, or national defense use. Withdrawal of
                                          public lands generally has the effect of segregating
                                          such land from lease, sale, settlement, or other
                                          dispositions under the public land laws.
work center(s) --                         Civil Engineering Operations maintenance teams
                                          organized to maintain and repair base facilities and
                                          infrastructure systems. Depending on the installation,
                                          these Centers can be classified as either shops, zones or
                                          a combination of both..
work orders --                            Work requiring detailed planning or capitalization of
                                          the real property records.
