YOKOTAABI34-242 4 APRIL 2012                                                                    9




Figure 1. Example Board
Ten candidates qualify to meet the quarterly board. First, each board member prepares ten score
sheets. Second, the candidates will come before the board to be inspected and questioned, with
each board member awarding points to each candidate on a score sheet. Once all candidates
have met the board, board members will align their score sheets in rank order from highest to
lowest. For instance, board member A gave candidate one 96 points, candidate three 80 points,
candidate six 78 points and so on. Candidate one is board member A’s number one candidate
because he or she had the most points, candidate three is board member A’s number two
candidate because he or she had the second highest point total. Once all the sheets are in order,
the board members will each identify their top four candidates, each giving their number one 4
place points, their number two 3 place points, and so forth. For instance, since candidate one is
board member A’s number one candidate, he or she will receive four place points. Assuming
that the other two judges also awarded candidate one the most points, candidate one will receive
12 place points total and be the Ceremonial Guardsman of the Quarter. If, however, board
members B and C gave the most points to candidate three, making him or her their number one
candidate and did not even rank candidate one in the top four, candidate three would become the
Ceremonial Guardsman of the Quarter with 11 place points to candidate one’s 4 place points. If
the event there is a tie, the HGC/HG OIC will cast the deciding vote.

       10.1.8. HG members are eligible to compete in their squadron quarterly and yearly
       boards. The Ceremonial Guardsman of the quarter and year programs are separate
       programs based primarily on HG participation, performance, and knowledge. The
       recognition and plaque given at the Wing level is consistent with the mission of the HG,
       which is done “in the name of the commander.” Winners of the quarterly board may
       receive a plaque funded by the 374 AW.
       10.1.9. If one or more members who would otherwise be eligible to meet the quarterly
       board cannot be present for reasons beyond their control, the board will decide the
       Ceremonial Guardsman of the Quarter by records only. The HGC/HG OIC is the final
       authority for the decision to hold a records only board.
       10.1.10. A records only board will be conducted:
           10.1.10.1. In a private location.
           10.1.10.2. On the same day the quarterly board was scheduled.
           10.1.10.3. Using a score sheet which is divided into (I) board member’s subjective
           points (10 points) and (II) objective points (1 point per detail attended, 2 points per
           detail commanded, and 1 point per practice attended, not to exceed 2 points per
           week).
       10.1.11. The HGC/HG OIC will cast the deciding vote in case of any ties.
       10.1.12. Board members will rank all candidates individually. A rank of number one is
       worth four place points, two-three place points, three-two place points, and four-one
       place points. The candidates will be ranked again by the number of place points they’ve

     acquired to determine the order of merit (see Figure 1). The number one candidate will
     be the Honor Guardsman of the quarter. There will be three runners-up.

Permission is granted for (Rank, Last Name, First Name, M.I.) to join the Yokota AB Honor
Guard for a minimum of 13 months.
                                           ELIGIBILITY
        Members of the Base Honor Guard are exceptional members of the Air Force. As such,
they must exemplify the standards of customs and courtesies, dress and appearance, and personal
conduct. Applicants must have at least 18 months left on station. Applicants must not be on a
Control Roster, nor have a UIF or Article 15 (pending or otherwise). Additionally, applicants
cannot be on a profile or weight management program. Those individuals enrolled in CDC’s
and/or in UGT must weigh commitment against workload.
                                            TRAINING
        All applicants must first complete a week training seminar. The seminar consists of 5
days of training from 1700 until 1800, with an initial evaluation on the fifth day of training. This
course consists of 5 days of training from 1700 until 1800, with an initial evaluation on the fifth
day of training. Members will be selected based on how they exemplify Air Force standards and
how proficient they have become in the basic functions of military honors learned during the
orientation and training month. Training is conducted in a militaristic environment and trainees
should expect a certain degree of stress and difficulty. If an individual is placed on training
flight and fails to make the ceremonial flight within 3 months the OIC or NCOIC has the option
of removing that individual from the Honor Guard.
                                             DUTIES
        Members may be required to perform any duties within the scope of the Yokota AB
Honor Guard. Members are responsible to stay current on all changes to all Honor Guard
instructions, manuals, and policies. In addition members are responsible for the following:
       a. Maintaining their uniforms at the highest level.
       b. Mastering all drill and ceremonies.
       c. Knowing traditional formation ceremonies and protocol.
       d. Conducting themselves in the most professional manner at all times.
       e. Members must be aware of their chain of command and use it at all times.
As a Base Honor Guard member, you should strive to exceed all Air Force standards and set the
example for all other members to follow.
 16                                                       YOKOTAABI34-242 4 APRIL 2012


                                          CONDUCT
        Members are responsible for outstanding attitude, conduct, and appearance IAW AFI 34-
242 (USAF Honor Guard Program) and AFI 36-2903 (Dress and Personal Appearance of Air
Force Personnel). These standards will be represented in the spirit of cooperation and proper
respect at all times. If at any time a member fails to meet the standards of the program, we will
recommend immediate termination of service from the Honor Guard.
                           ATTENDANCE AND PERFORMANCE
        Once an individual makes the team, it then becomes a mandatory military function. The
team relies on precision and teamwork gained through practice. Therefore, continuous absences,
except for TDY/Leave or formal training, cannot and will not be tolerated. All members are
required to attend mandatory practices each Wednesday from 1500 to 1700 and an all day
practice the last Friday of each month. No consecutive absences will be tolerated. If the
member is unable to make practices and/or details due to mission requirements or sickness, the
member’s First Sergeant must notify the NCOIC of the Honor Guard Program in advance. Any
consecutive absences or failure to show for a ceremonial function will result in a No Show Letter
reported to the member’s squadron commander and the squadron’s group level Point of Contact
(POC) for the honor guard. Any other consecutive absences will give cause to recommend
termination of the member. If a member were terminated before 13-month commitment, the
member’s group/squadron would be liable for reimbursement of all items issued
(uniform/garment bag). All benefits would terminate (see benefits). Future changes in
workload/manning that may conflict with attendance will be considered.
                              UNIFORMS AND APPEARANCE
        One set of Ceremonial Service Dress and ABU’s will be provided to each member as
available (see Issued Items). Uniforms will be maintained in a clean, pressed condition at all
times, both on & off Honor Guard duty. The standards of AFI 36-2903 will be strictly adhered
to. All members will be authorized cleaning of uniform items IAW AFI 34-242.
                                      LEAVE AND TDY
       Members are required to notify the NCOIC, of Yokota Base Honor Guard Program of all
TDY’s, leaves, etc., and are required to submit one copy of leave authorization or TDY orders to
the NCOIC before departing Yokota AB. TDY in excess of 30 days will lengthen the member’s
term of service by the total length of the TDY.
