SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially changed and must be reviewed in its entirety. The change is a
policy directive update and establishes the Air Force IA program and risk management
framework as an essential element to accomplishing the Air Force mission. The revision
removed detailed IA information now published in AFI 33-200, Information Assurance (IA)
Management and AFI 33-210, Air Force Certification and Accreditation (C&A) Program
 2                                                                 AFPD33-2 3 AUGUST 2011


(AFCAP). This directive addresses the Head of DoD Components responsibilities identified in
DoD Directives in relation to Information Assurance.
1. Background. DoDD 8500.01E establishes the Defense IA Program pursuant to Title 10
United States Code Section 2224, which requires compliance with FISMA.
     1.1. IA is defined as measures that protect and defend information and information systems
     (ISs) by ensuring their availability, integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and non-
     repudiation. These measures include providing for restoration of information systems by
     incorporating protection, detection, and reaction capabilities.
     1.2. Core IA disciplines consist of IA Awareness, Training, and Certification;
     Communications Security (COMSEC); Computer Security (COMPUSEC); Emission
     Security (EMSEC); and Risk Management Framework (including Certification and
     Accreditation (C&A)).
     1.3. IA is associated with the Air Force Information Protection Program and its components
     of personnel, physical, industrial, and information security. IA, however, encompasses more
     than Information Protection. Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 3-13, Information
     Operations, links IA to Information Operations as an integrated control enabler. Per AFDD
     3-12, Cyberspace Operations, IA is also linked to Defensive Cyberspace Operations as a
     complementary function.
Note: The term “information assurance” as defined and used in the DoD and Air Force IA
Programs is synonymous with the term “information security” as defined in the FISMA.
2. Objective. This directive establishes the Air Force IA program. IA is a risk management
activity that must be balanced with operational need.
3. Scope. This directive applies to all information and ISs within Air Force purview, excluding
non-Air Force space, Special Access Programs (SAP)/Special Access Requirements (SAR), and
Intelligence community ISs. Space systems supporting only the Air Force are under the purview
of the SAF/CIO A6. Non-Air Force space systems are multi-Component space systems (e.g.,
those supporting more than one DoD Component) and are under the purview of United States
Strategic Command. Nothing in this directive shall alter or supersede the existing authorities and
policies of the Director of National Intelligence regarding the protection of Sensitive
Compartmented Information (SCI) and SAP for intelligence. The application of the provisions
and procedures of this directive to SCI or other intelligence ISs is encouraged where they may
complement or address areas not otherwise specifically addressed.
4. Policy. The Air Force IA program leverages fact-based operational risk assessments to
ensure adequate safeguards and controls are implemented to ensure the availability, integrity,
confidentiality, authentication, and non-repudiation of Air Force information and ISs in support
of operational missions and business functions. Specific direction, details, procedures and
guidance necessary to implement the Air Force IA program can be found in Air Force 33-2XX
series instructions, applicable technical orders, and special security instructions. Total risk
avoidance, based on Air Force IA strategy, is not practical and therefore risk assessment and
management is required.
     4.1. Consistent with its status in AFDD 3-13, as an integrated control enabler and in support
     of mission assurance as defined in AFDD 3-12, IA policy shall be aligned and synchronized
AFPD33-2 3 AUGUST 2011                                                                       3


  with NetOps, Information Operations, and Cyberspace Operations. IA policy will also be
  aligned and synchronized with Information Protection policy and guidance.
     4.1.1. The Air Force will develop guidance to ensure the IA program and NetOps
     functions are executed consistent with the direction provided in DoDI 8410.02, NetOps
     for the Global Information Grid (GIG). The definition for NetOps outlined in DoDI
     8410.02 will serve as the basis for delineating IA responsibilities under the guise of GIG
     Net Assurance versus “compliance and oversight” IA responsibilities (e.g., FISMA)
     supporting the federally-mandated functions of the Air Force Chief Information Officer.
     4.1.2. Consistent with Air Force policy on Cyberspace Operations guidance (to be
     published under AFPD 10-17, Cyberspace Operations, and the Air Force 10-17XX series
     publications), the GIG Net Assurance functions outlined in this directive will
     complement the Defensive Cyberspace Operations component of Cyber Warfare.
  4.2. Under the provisions of this directive the Air Force will:
     4.2.1. Develop IA Implementation and Defensive Cyberspace Operations support
     guidance consistent with DoDI 8500.2, Information Assurance Implementation and DoDI
     O-8530.2, Support to Computer Network Defense.              The guidance will be
     synchronized/deconflicted with Air Force Cyberspace Operations and Information
     Protection policy/guidance as appropriate.
     4.2.2. Develop guidance for Space Systems and its portion of the Defense Acquisition
     System per DoDI 8580.1, Information Assurance (IA) in the Defense Acquisition
     System, and DoDI 8581.01, Information Assurance (IA) Policy for Space Systems Used
     by the Department of Defense. The Air Force will incorporate the guidance, as
     applicable, for instructions under this directive and Air Force policy on Information
     Protection (to be published under AFPD 16-14, Information Protection, and the Air Force
     16-14XX-series publications.
     4.2.3. Develop COMSEC and Cryptographic-related guidance, objectives, and standards
     consistent with DoDI 5200.16, Objectives and Minimum Standards for Communications
     Security (COMSEC) Measures Used in Nuclear Command and Control (NC2)
     Communications (U), DoDI 5205.08, Access to Classified Cryptographic Information,
     and DoDI 8523.01, Communications Security (COMSEC).
     4.2.4. Develop EMSEC guidance, objectives, and standards consistent with DoDD C-
     5200.19, Control of Compromising Emanations and National guidance.
     4.2.5. Incorporate the DoD Certification and Accreditation Program and IA Workforce
     Improvement Program into its guidance consistent with DoDI 8510.01, DoD Information
     Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process, DoDD 8570.01, and DoD 8570.01-M,
     Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program.
     4.2.6. Develop guidance on Ports, Protocols, and Services Management, Biometrics,
     Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Public Enabling consistent with DoDI 8551.1, Ports,
     Protocols, and Services (PPSM), DoDD 8521.01E, and DoDI 8520.02, Public Key
     Infrastructure (PKI) and Public Key (PK) Enabling, respectively.
 4                                                                AFPD33-2 3 AUGUST 2011


        4.2.7. Develop guidance on Defense Industrial Base and security of unclassified DoD
        information on Non-DoD Systems consistent with DoDI 5205.13, Defense Industrial
        Base (DIB) Cyber Security/Information Assurance (CS/IA) Activities.
        4.2.8. Develop guidance on the use of mobile code technologies consistent with DoDI
        8552.01, Use of Mobile Code Technologies in DoD Information Systems.
        4.2.9. Develop an IA governance structure and implement the Senior Risk Executive
        Function consistent with the DoD Risk Management Framework.
        4.2.10. Ensure the concepts of reciprocity and reuse are implemented consistent with
        DoD IA policy and guidance.
