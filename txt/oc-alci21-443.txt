This instruction implements and extends the guidance of AFI 21-101_AFMCSUP1, Aircraft and
Equipment Maintenance Management, procedures governing identification of welding material
responsibilities within the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex (OC-ALC). This OC-ALC
instruction establishes procedures and responsibilities for submission of welding wire and
welding rod to the 76th Maintenance Support Squadron, Analytical Chemistry Section (76
MXSS/MXDTAA) for chemical analysis. This instruction applies to the 76th Aircraft
Maintenance Group (76 AMXG), the 76th Propulsion Maintenance Group (76 PMXG), the 76th
Commodities Maintenance Group (76 CMXG), and 76 MXSS/MXDTAA. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and
disposed IAW the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm
or as required by Title V operating permit. Refer recommended changes and questions about this
publication to the office of primary responsibility (OPR) using the Air Force (AF) Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the
appropriate functional’s chain of command.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been updated to reflect administrative changes of 76 MXW to OC-ALC
nomenclatures. AFMC Form 137, Routed Order (Project Directed), is obsolete and AFMC
Form 127, Routed Order, is used in its place. This publication should be read in its entirety.

1. Scope. This instruction covers definitions, references, responsibilities, and color coding for
welding wire and welding rod identification. Precious metals are excluded from this instruction.
2. Definitions.
     2.1. Tab Marking. A plastic label bearing the specification number, including type, class
     and or grade designation, and the prefix indicating the source of the specification. Tab
     marking is commonly referred to as flag tagging.
     2.2. Permanent Marking. Marking which will ensure identification during the normal
     service life of the item.
     2.3. Temporary Marking. Marking which will ensure identification during ordinary
     handling and storage of items prior to use.
     2.4. Color Code. The identification and marking of material by a series of color bands
     where a color represents a number.
3. Responsibilities.
     3.1. Production Maintenance Groups (76 AMXG/76 PMXG/76 CMXG) will:
        3.1.1. Check all welding wire and welding rods upon receipt from the supplier. Each
        welding wire spool shall be permanently and legibly marked on the outer face of one or
        both flanges with not less than the following information: Alloy name, specification
        number, size, quantity or weight, heat number (if applicable), and manufacturer’s
        identification. Welding rods shall be suitably packaged to ensure against damage during
        shipment and be legibly marked so as to be visible from the outside of each unit package
        with not less than the following information: specification number, manufacturer’s
        identification, size/weight, and lot, control, or heat number. Welding wire and rod not
        conforming to this requirement shall have the entire lot marked as non-conforming,
        segregated, and returned to the supplier.
        3.1.2. Submit samples of welding wire/rod to the Analytical Chemistry Section
        (76 MXSS/MXDTAA) for chemical analysis, when:
            3.1.2.1. Identification markings are not legible or not present.
            3.1.2.2. A non-conformance is suspected.
            3.1.2.3. Quality verification is desired. Properly completed Air Force Materiel
            Command (AFMC) Form 127, Routed Order, must be attached to the sample.
        3.1.3. Upon receipt of laboratory report from 76 MXSS/MXDTAA, each spool of
        welding wire shall be permanently and legibly marked on the outer face of one or both
        flanges with not less than the following information: Alloy name, specification number,
        “76 MXSS/MXDTAA TESTED,” and laboratory report date. Each package of welding
        rods shall be permanently and legibly marked with not less than the following
        information: Specification number, “76 MXSS/MXDTAA TESTED,” and laboratory
        report date. A copy of the 76 MXSS/MXDTAA laboratory report that the material was
        tested will be maintained by the using organization.
        3.1.4. Identify individual storage bins of welding wire/rod with the nomenclature and
        specification number.
OC-ALCI21-443 24 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                3


       3.1.5. Store in a separate area marked “unknown material,” when material is found for
       which correct identification is uncertain. Unknown material shall be marked with the
       date it is placed in unknown material area and shall be properly disposed of within
       30 days. A completed, Department of Defense (DD) Form 1577, Unserviceable
       (Condemned) Tag Material, or DD Form 1577-1, Unserviceable (Condemned) Tag-
       Material, shall be affixed to the unknown welding material.
       3.1.6. Return material to supplier in cases where material is found to be misidentified or
       unsuitable for use. Identify any non-conforming material using laboratory report from
       76 MXSS/MXDTAA and mark as “Non-conforming Material.”
   3.2. The Analytical Chemistry Section (76 MXSS/MXDTAA) will:
       3.2.1. Perform chemical analysis to determine the positive identification of the welding
       material to applicable specification requirements.
       3.2.2. Prepare a written laboratory report in memorandum format with the proper
       identification of the welding material and notify the customer when the report is
       completed. A completed copy of AFMC Form 127 will be attached. Requesting
       organization will pick up report and sample from 76 MXSS/MXDTAA, building 3001,
       post I-63. When priority testing is requested, 76 MXSS/MXDTAA will telephone
       requesting organization that report is ready for pickup. Reports will be mailed using base
       distribution upon request.
4. Color Coding for Identification.
   4.1. Individual cut lengths of bare welding wire shall be marked using color bands as per
   Aerospace Material Specification (AMS) 2819B, Identification, Welding Wire Direct Color
   Code System, tab marked per AMS 2816W, Identification Welding Wire, Tab Marking
   Method, or permanently marked per AS 478N, Identification Marking Methods. Welding
   wire presently on hand and identified by using the previous color code or individually tabbed
   or permanently marked will be consumed as is, without re-identification. Each color
   represents a number that is used to designate the AMS specification. The first color band
   shall be approximately ¼ inch from one end of the wire and shall be ½ inch wide. Each
   succeeding band shall be ¼ inch wide with a ¼ inch space between bands representing
   succeeding numbers of the AMS specification in the proper order. The total length of the
   color code shall not exceed 2 ¼ inches from one end of the wire. Only one set of color bands
   shall be applied to each length of wire. The bands shall extend completely around the
   circumference of the wire. Numbers used in the marking code represent a color as indicated
   in Table 4.1. below.

Table 1. Marking Code
0- Yellow            4- Gray           8- Red
1- Black             5- Green          9- White
2- Blue              6- Orange
3- Brown             7- Violet

    4.2. Spools of welding wire will not be color marked, but shall be permanently and legibly
    marked on the outer face of one or both flanges as described in paragraph 4.1.
