SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been revised and must be reviewed in its entirety. This revision clarifies
policy and incorporates updates to the February 2010 edition. Qualifying note 24 was added to
address CONECT. Qualifying note 6 was added to address center of gravity fuel level system
and subsystems 73K, 73P and 77N were deleted. The basic systems list area of the Table had
minor administrative corrections. A more robust list of abbreviations and acronyms was created.
1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the
ground work for reporting the status of aircraft availability. They list the minimum essential
systems and subsystems that must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit
wartime, training, test or other missions. Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in readiness
Status of Resources and Training System reporting only and denotes mission capable (MC)
aircraft capable of being configured for a contingency mission IAW COMAFGSC OMNIBUS
Plan.
     1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex
     degraded mission systems such as suspension equipment.
     1.2. Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy Fully
     Mission Capable (FMC) aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC.
     A Not Mission Capable (NMC) aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can
     be configured and generated to MRA status at an employment site.
     1.3. All AFGSC, and AFRC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using AFGSC
     MESLs. Major Command (MAJCOM) differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon
     actual deployment in support of a Geographic Combatant Commander, the DEPORD or
     OPORD will specify whether the supported Combatant Commander is responsible for
     resourcing any differences in support/mission equipment. Unless specified otherwise,
     AFGSC remains responsible for all logistics support.
     1.4. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by work unit code
     (WUC) against the Full Systems List (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems List (BSL)
     across the page. Each unit's Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement determines
     applicability of BSL columns. This aircraft MESL incorporates all AFGSC assigned aircraft
     and is important to compare only those columns listed which are applicable to the unit's
     assigned aircraft. For example, units with CC (wartime) coded aircraft would determine and
     report status using only the Full System Listing (FSL) and Basic System Listing (BSL)
     columns related to their DOC statement. Units with TF (training) coded aircraft would
     determine and report status using only the FSL and Training (TNG) columns , and units with
     CB (test) coded aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL and TEST
     columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft will ensure status is reported using the MESL
     columns appropriate to the individual aircraft assignment code.
