                                                                  CORRECTION OF MILITARY RECORDS (AFBCMR)

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

This pamphlet tells you how to apply to the AFBCMR for correction of your military records. It may not have all the
answers you require, but it does give you a basic explanation of the process and tells where to get additional help. It applies
to persons with Air Force military records (including persons from the Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve) and their
heirs and legal representatives.

1. Your Right to Apply for Correction of Records. Any person with Air Force military records, or his or her heirs or
legal representative, may apply to the AFBCMR. Title 10, United States Code, Section 1552, is the law governing
correction of military records. This statute authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) to correct any military record
when "necessary to correct an error or injustice." The purpose of this statute was to relieve the Congress from consideration
of private bills to correct errors or injustices in military records. The statute provides for SAF to act through a board of Air
Force civilians in considering applications for correction of military records. AFI 36-2603, Air Force Board for Correction
of Military Records, implements the statute within the Air Force.

2. When to Apply to the AFBCMR:
2.1. You should exhaust other administrative remedies before appealing to the AFBCMR. For example, you should first
submit a performance report appeal to the Evaluation Reports Appeal Board (ERAB) under AFI 36-2401, Correcting
Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Reports. An appeal requesting upgrade of discharge should normally be submitted to the
Discharge Review Board under Air Force Supplement to Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 1332.28, Discharge
Review Board (DRB) Procedures and Standards, August 11, 1992, with changes 1 and 2, The AFBCMR will return your
application if you have not first sought relief through the appropriate administrative process. The AFBCMR will consider
your case only after you have exhausted other available avenues of appeal.
2.2. You should submit your request within 3 years after you discover, or reasonably could have discovered, the error or
injustice. The AFBCMR reviews the merits of untimely applications. If found to be meritorious, the timeliness is waived in
the interest of justice. The AFBCMR may waive the 3-year limitation and consider untimely applications in the interest of
justice. You should not assume, however, that a waiver will be granted.

3. How To Apply to the AFBCMR:
3.1. Application is a simple process. You should use a DD Form 149, Application for Correction of Military Record
Under the Provisions of Title 10, United States Code, Section 1552. You may get a DD Form 149 from any Air Force
Military Personnel Flight or publications distribution office. You may also get the form by writing to SAF/MIBR, 550 C
Street West, Suite 40, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4722, or the AFBCMR, 1535 Command Drive, EE Wing 3rd Floor,
Andrews AFB MD 20331-7002.
3.2. You should complete the form very carefully by typing or printing the requested information. Attach copies of
statements or records that are relevant to your case. Make sure you sign item 16 of the form. Mail it to the Air Force
address provided on the reverse of the form.

4. How To Support Your Request:
4.1. The AFBCMR will correct your military records only if you can prove that you are the victim of error or injustice.
You do this by providing evidence, such as signed statements from you and other witnesses or copies of records that support
your case. It is not enough to provide the names of witnesses. The AFBCMR will not contact your witnesses to obtain
statements. You should contact your witnesses to get their signed statements with your request.
