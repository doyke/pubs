                                            Chapter 10
                        AIRCRAFT RESCUE AND FIRE FIGHTING
10.1. General.
10.1.1. This chapter provides fire protection policy and guidance for determining minimum
aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) requirements for all AMC fixed-wing aircraft operating
into airfields worldwide. Exceptions to this policy are listed in paragraph 10.3. For all other
airfields not exempted in paragraph 10.3, it is the responsibility of the mission planner and
aircraft commander to ensure airfields meet ARFF requirements contained in this chapter, to
include contacting airfield managers and referencing the GDSS database or applicable airfield
publications. If applicable, follow waiver guidance contained in paragraph 10.4 and Table 10.2.
PACAF, USAFE, CENTAF, ARC, etc. aircraft flying on 618 AOC (TACC)-controlled missions
will be considered AMC aircraft. POC for ARFF is HQ AMC/A7XF, DSN 779-0713/0714/0725.
10.1.2. Airfields that publish a NOTAM restricting specific aircraft due to a degrade in ARFF
capability, will take precedence over the ARFF guidance in this chapter. Additionally, NOTAMS
reducing airfield ARFF capabilities will still be subject to the requirements in Table 10.2.
10.1.3. AMC will, on occasion, use commercial contract carriers. The final authority for
determining ARFF suitability is the contracted carrier as guided by FAA regulations. If ARFF
suitability is below that required for a commercial carrier, the carriers’ dispatchers will typically
contact the airfield to see if they can raise their firefighting capability. Company dispatchers
should also coordinate with 618 AOC (TACC) for assistance, if needed.

10.2. Definitions.
10.2.1. ARFF Vehicle. A motorized vehicle that carries a quantity of water and fire
extinguishing agent in affixed tanks. It must be equipped with a fire pump capable of discharging
metered water and foam through one or more turrets and monitor the deluge gun nozzle while the
vehicle is in motion. These discharge devices may be electrically, hydraulically, or manually
controlled.
10.2.2. Assault Landing Zone (ALZ). An airfield or prepared area designed for training or
employment use.
10.2.3. Optimum Level of Service (OLS). The amount of agent and firefighters needed to
execute rescue operations on both the interior and exterior of an aircraft that is involved in a
large fire.
10.2.4. Reduced Level of Service (RLS). The amount of agent and firefighters needed to execute
rescue operations at one location of the aircraft that is involved in a substantial fire.
10.2.5. Critical Level of Service (CLS). The amount of agent and firefighters needed to execute
rapid intervention at one location of the aircraft that is involved in a small fire.
AMCI11-208_AMCGM1, 14 May 2013                                                                     3



10.3. Policy. As stated in paragraph 10.1, this chapter provides ARFF guidance for all AMC
aircraft operating at airfields worldwide. The following exceptions to this guidance are listed
below and will not require a waiver from 618 AOC (TACC) or 18th AF.
10.3.1. Takeoff and Landing Frequency. Infrequent operations to airfields will not require a
waiver or adherence to the guidance contained in Table 10.2. IAW AFPAM 32-2004, infrequent
operations are defined as: USAF aircraft category 1 through 3 (C-21, C-27, C-9, C-130): Not
more than four planned takeoffs and four planned landings within seven consecutive days.
USAF aircraft category 4 through 6 (C-135, C-17, KC-10, C-5): Not more than two planned
takeoffs and two planned landings within seven consecutive days.
10.3.2. Department of Defense (DoD) airfields. Any airfield worldwide where a DoD
manager/contractor is present and operates under their respective DoD ARFF guidance. For
example, while Moron AB or Yokota AB are not wholly under DoD control, a DoD airfield
manager is on location.
10.3.3. FAA part 139 airfields. Those airfields, as listed in the Part 139 Airport Certification
Status List (ACSL), which meet the minimum FAA ARFF index below, are exempted for the
following aircraft:
10.3.3.1.   C-5, KC-10 – FAA ARFF index E
10.3.3.2.   C-17, C-135 – FAA ARFF index D or better
10.3.3.3.   C-9, C-130 – FAA ARFF index C or better
10.3.3.4.   C-27, C-21 – FAA ARFF index B or better
Note: If the airfield does not meet the above criteria, and exceeds the frequency exemption in
paragraph 10.3.1., then follow the waiver guidance contained in Table 10.2. Reference the link
below to access the ACSL: http://www.faa.gov/airports/airport_safety/part139_cert/
10.3.4. ICAO airfields. Those airfields meeting the minimum ICAO aerodrome ARFF
performance level, are exempted for the following aircraft:
10.3.4.1.   C-5 – Performance level category 9 or higher
10.3.4.2.   KC-10 – Performance level category 8 or higher
10.3.4.3.   C-17, C-135 – Performance level category 7 or higher
10.3.4.4.   C-9, C-130 – Performance level category 6 or higher
10.3.4.5.   C-27 – Performance level category 5 or higher
10.3.4.6.   C-21 – Performance level category 3 or higher
Note: If ICAO ARFF performance level category is in question, consider the following
publications: Flight Information Publication (FLIP), Automated Air Facilities Intelligence Files
(AAFIF), Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP)*, or an Embassy Deputy Air Officer
(DAO). If the airfield does not meet the above criteria, and exceeds the frequency exemption in
paragraph 10.3.1., then follow the waiver guidance contained in Table 10.2.
*Typically countries publish their own AIP.
AMCI11-208_AMCGM1, 14 May 2013                                                                    4



10.3.5. In an ongoing effort to make ARFF data more readily accessible to mission planners and
crews, AMC/A3A will populate the GDSS database with information that becomes available
during annual review of normal airfield assessment sources. Planners are also expected to add to
the database any information they get from reliable sources, stating the name, date, and source of
the information.
10.3.6. 618 AOC (TACC) and HQ AMC/A7X must review any unique operational risks that
would require pre-positioning ARFF personnel/equipment and ensure ARFF coordination
outlined in this instruction.
10.3.7. The Air Reserve Component (ARC) will coordinate ARFF requirements for ARC-
controlled missions.

10.4. Waiver Request.
10.4.1. A waiver request must include the following:
10.4.1.1. Date(s) and type of operations.
10.4.1.2. Type aircraft involved.
10.4.1.3. Description of available ARFF assets to include dedicated manpower, amount of
firefighting agent available, and number of ARFF vehicles.
10.4.2. Waiver authority for operational missions rests with the 18 AF/CC, HQ AFRC/DO, and
ANG/DO. If a waiver is required, initiate a formal waiver request. If obtaining a formal waiver
will result in the delay of a mission, request a verbal waiver from 18 AF. Follow-up with the
formal waiver process as soon as time permits. Provide an after-action summary to the
appropriate waiver authority with information copies to 618 AOC (TACC), HQ AMC/A4T, and
HQ AMC/A7XF.
10.5. Mission Impact Statement. A mission impact statement must accompany all waiver
requests.
NOTE: No waiver is required for the first aircraft in and the last aircraft out carrying ARFF
equipment.
10.6. Unilateral Aircrew Training. Determine ALZ/airfield ARFF requirements for unilateral
aircrew training on a case-by-case basis. If the requirements in table 10.2. are not met, submit a
waiver request to include a description of the ALZ/airfield. Record the approval for ALZ training
operations on the appropriate ALZ Survey (AMC Form 340, Landing Zone Survey). The
approval remains in effect until the next required survey.
10.7. Aeromedical Evacuation. AFI 11-2AE, volume 3, Aeromedical Evacuation operations
procedures, paragraph 6.24. addresses concurrent refueling operations for aeromedical
evacuations.
10.8. Special Weapons Standby Requirement. A minimum of one Air Force P-19 (or
equivalent) is required when an aircraft carrying special weapons (e.g. nuclear weapons, guided
AMCI11-208_AMCGM1, 14 May 2013                                                                          5



missiles) lands at an airfield and conducts on-load and off-load operations, as well as start
engines/taxi/takeoff.

10.9. Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting Requirements.
10.9.1. Minimum fire protection capabilities in this instruction are based on Operational Risk
Management (ORM) principles. Firefighting and rescue capabilities can be extremely limited
when operating at locations not managed by a USAF airfield manager.
10.9.1.1. The ARFF requirements listed in table 10.2. are the minimum required to attack and
provide a rescue path in the initial stages of an aircraft fire. It provides limited capability to assist
crewmember evacuation or sustained fire suppression operations. Aircrews operating at locations
with reduced or critical levels of service must be made aware of the increased risk as a result of
limited fire protection capabilities.
10.9.2. ARFF requirements at airfields not managed by a DoD Airfield Manager are based on
type of aircraft, firefighters, and gallons of firefighting agent carried on ARFF vehicles. When
aircraft types are mixed, ARFF requirements are based on the largest requirement for a single
type of aircraft.
10.9.2.1. Manpower requirements are based on fire ground activities. Operations at airfields
with less than CLS manpower are not authorized and a waiver must be submitted.
10.9.2.2. Fire protection manpower assigned to non-USAF ARFF vehicles should be
commensurate with the size and specific mission of the vehicle.
10.10. Guidance on ARFF Suitability. Determine the ARFF suitability of the airfield by
obtaining aircraft type, number of firefighters and gallons of firefighting agent available.
Reference table 10.2 with the data to determine the level of service. If the ARFF capability falls
below the OLS category, missions are approved with crew awareness. If the ARFF capability
falls below the RLS category, missions are approved with 618 AOC (TACC) Director (or
designated representative) approval, or OG/CC approval for unit planned missions. If ARFF
capability falls below the CLS category, missions will require 18AF/CC (or designated
representative) approval IAW paragraph 10.4.

10.11. Risk Management.
10.11.1. Capability for each primary resource (agent and personnel) is described as OLS, RLS,
or CLS. The overall capability is the lowest level of service available for either resource. For
example, when agent is OLS and personnel are CLS, the overall capability is CLS.
10.11.2. OLS capability represents the amount of agent needed to execute rescue operations on
both the interior and exterior of an aircraft that is involved in a large fire. OLS provides
sufficient agent for quick knockdown of large exterior fires for one minute. It also provides for
the continued control, up to the complete extinguishment of, the exterior fire after the first
minute. Additionally, it provides enough agent to support hose lines for interior firefighting and
rescue operations. OLS provides reasonable expectation of successful rescue where large fires
are involved.
10.11.3. RLS capability represents the amount of agent needed to execute rescue operations at
one location of the aircraft that is involved in a substantial fire. Sufficient agent is provided for
exterior fire control for one minute and enough continued control of the fire after the first
minute, up to the complete extinguishment of the exterior fire. It also provides enough agent for
interior fire attack with hose lines. This level of service represents increased risk/loss potential
due to lack of sufficient agent to perform rescue, and simultaneously conduct both interior and
exterior firefighting. A rescue operation is not expected from catastrophic fire situations where
simultaneous attack on interior and exterior fires would be required.
10.11.4. CLS capability represents the amount of agent needed to execute rapid intervention at
one location of the aircraft that is involved in a small fire. At this level, rescue is not expected
from inside the aircraft. This level of service represents increased risk/loss potential due to the
lack of sufficient agent to maintain control of exterior or interior fire long enough to conduct
interior rescue operations. Rescue may still be possible from fighter-type aircraft where interior
firefighting operations are not needed.
10.11.5. Regardless of available manpower, CLS agent in Table 10.2. represents increased risk
to aircrews and reduces the probability that the fire can be extinguished. The RLS column is a
safer alternative and provides increased capability. CLS is the minimum level of agent
acceptable and should be limited to very short duration operations. This level of protection is
necessary before operations begin.
10.11.6. When airfields/conditions fall outside of the exempted criteria, aircraft commanders
and mission planners shall take the necessary steps to ensure adequate fire protection capabilities
exist prior to approving AMC mission operations into an airfield.
