     3.2.1. Edwards AFB is located in a vehicle emissions inspection and maintenance program
     area and is required to comply with the terms of the Clean Air Act Section 118(d). For active
     duty and civil service employees who drive on base 60 or more days per year, the installation
     is required to obtain employee proof of compliance with emissions testing. This is
     accomplished through Air Force Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program by means of
     the Employee-vehicle Certification and Reporting System (ECARS) self-certification process
     IAW AFI 32-7040, Air Quality Compliance and Resource Management. Failure to respond
     and comply with ECARS requirements may result in administrative actions, to include
     revocation of driving privileges, at the discretion of the installation commander. Driving
     privileges should be restored upon satisfactorily complying with ECARS requirements.

   soon as possible so a report can be filed.
   4.13.7. If an ORV operator wishes to operate an ORV alone, the operator should notify
   someone on base and brief them where they will be riding and for approximately how long.
   If the ORV operator does not return in that approximate time, the person who was notified
   should contact the Emergency Control Center so the ORV operator can be located and their
   status can be verified.

   sergeant will normally determine whether a vehicle accident qualifies as a major or minor
   vehicle accident. In circumstances when the flight chief is unable to make such a
   determination, a qualified traffic accident investigator will be contacted and the investigator
   will make the determination. The 412th Security Forces Squadron on-duty flight sergeant
   will determine when a minor motor vehicle accident will be investigated.

A2.3. When determining the appropriate length of an on-base driving
suspension: Commanders are encouraged to consider other factors behind the traffic offense.
Did factors include location (e.g., did the speeding offense take place in a school zone, housing
area, or in heavy traffic?) and conditions (e.g., did the speeding take place in adverse weather
conditions, to include high winds or limited visibility), mitigate or increase the severity of the
speeding offense? Location and condition factors may warrant a more severe on-base driving
privilege suspension penalty.
