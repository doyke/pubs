This instruction supersedes part of AFI 34-701, Child Development Programs, and implements AFPD
34-2, Community Programs; DoDI 6060.2, Child Development Program; DoDI 1402.5, Criminal History
Background Checks; the Military Child Care Act of 1989/1996; and the Crime Control Act of 1990. This
instruction gives the requirements for operating child development centers on Air Force bases. It applies
to people involved in operating child development centers on Air Force installations and for Air Force
personnel. The requirements for operating family child care programs are now provided in AFI 34-276,
Family Child Care Program. Attachment 1 contains a glossary of references and information used in
this instruction. Attachment 2 lists the specific responsibilities of personnel involved in the implemen-
tation, operation, oversight, and evaluation of Air Force child development centers. Attachment 3 out-
lines the requirements for offering short-term hourly care. Attachment 4 outlines the requirements for
accepting children and staff who are HIV-positive or who have AIDS. Attachment 5 describes the level
of supervision required in various settings. This instruction is affected by the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1974, as amended in 1996. All supplements to this instruction must be approved by AF/ILV. This

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

grams. It aligns the instruction with AFPD 34-2, Community Programs, and implements the revisions
that are required by the documents listed above. It removes the requirements for family child care pro-
grams and places them in AFI 34-276, Family Child Care Programs. Waivers or supplements to this
instruction must be approved by AF/ILV.

                                      SUPERVISION REQUIRED

A5.1. Adequate Supervision. To ensure there is adequate supervision of facilities in which children are
receiving child care comply with these requirements:
   A5.1.1. Have a GS-5, NAF equivalent (in pay and job responsibilities) or higher level supervisor in

       be the supervisor.
       A5.1.1.2. If the program is being operated in another facility, such as a chapel or youth center,
       and other adults are in the facility, and there are 48 children or less, the GS-5 or NAF equivalent
       (in pay and job responsibilities) supervisor may also be responsible for a ratio of children.
       A5.1.1.3. If there are 99 or more children in a facility, the facility must have a director responsible
