                                         Chapter 1

                               GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General: The primary purpose of this instruction is to provide guidance and outline
procedures for an effective FOD/DOP program on Wright-Patterson AFB. Effective prevention
of FOD to aircraft and equipment depends upon support from every individual who has any
contact with aircraft/equipment. Individual involvement in the program will improve readiness
and save resources.
1.2. Program Objective: The objective of the FOD/DOP Program is the elimination of FOD
potential or dropped objects on Wright-Patterson AFB. AFI 21-101 lists some causes of FOD
and practices that will eliminate damage. Each individual needs to become aware of FOD or
dropped object causes and prevention measures and work closely with the Unit FOD/DOP
Monitor to ensure potential hazards are immediately reported and corrected.

                                     DAILY OPERATIONS

4.1. Immediately upon entering the airfield: all vehicle operators will conduct a FOD check
of the vehicle. Wright-Patterson’s airfield is defined as runways, taxiways, aircraft parking
ramps, access, service and perimeter roads, hangars, buildings and all open areas immediately
adjacent to runways, taxiways and aircraft parking ramps. EXCEPTION: Emergency vehicles
responding to actual emergencies and alert vehicles responding to an alert. Once the actual
emergency or alert is over, a tire FOD check will be accomplished prior to continuing on.
     4.1.1. Vehicle operators must make every attempt to stay on paved surfaces and avoid
     driving on unimproved surfaces (e.g., dirt or grass). If driving on unimproved surfaces is
     required, conduct a FOD check upon exit of these areas or returning to paved surfaces.
     4.1.2. At a minimum, a FOD check will consist of the following:
        4.1.2.1. A roll-over inspection of vehicle tires.
            4.1.2.1.1. Stop the vehicle, check/remove debris from all four tires, pull the vehicle
            forward 18 to 24 inches, then once again check/remove debris from all four tires.
        4.1.2.2. A visual check to ensure all external vehicle components are secured. Secure
        any/all items loaded on payload vehicle, including all tie down device loose ends such as
        chains, ropes, packaging or other item that may become dislodged during movement
        while on the airfield. Vehicle operators towing support equipment onto the airfield will
        also remove FOD from the equipment tires.
        4.1.2.3. An inspection of the interior and cargo bed areas of vehicle to remove or secure
        all foreign material that could pose a FOD hazard.
        4.1.2.4. A thorough walk around of the vehicle to check for damaged, loose, or worn
        parts.
     4.1.3. Vehicle operators encountering FOD on the airfield will stop and collect it. Large
     amounts of debris will be reported to AMOPS or the Maintenance Operations Center.
4.2. All vehicles normally operated on the flightline will be equipped with FOD
containers. Containers will be tailored to the vehicle it is installed in/on and will meet the
requirements of AFI 21-101, Chapter 14, and AFI21-101_AFMCSUP, and approved by the
Wing FOD Monitor prior to use.
4.3. Hats/berets will not be worn on the airfield within the vicinity of operating jet
engines. EXCEPTION: When conducting official protocol duties on the airfield, the senior
officer present, or his/her representative, will consider risk factors including weather and
proximity to operating aircraft engines and dictate if hats are to be worn for a particular occasion
(this does not include baggage and aircraft support personnel). No individual wearing a hat,
regardless of rank, will pass within 25 feet of an operating engine.
4.4. Headgear/clothing authorized for extreme cold weather protection: may be worn;
however, every effort must be made to prevent such headgear from coming loose during duty

performance. Special attention to the FOD potential and safety of personnel will be prime
considerations when determining extreme cold weather clothing authorizations.
4.5. Badges such as Restricted Areas Badges will be secured with a nylon/cotton cord or
plastic armband. Metal insignia/badges will not be worn on the airfield.
4.6. All personnel are prohibited from wearing loose fitting items that could be ingested by
operating jet engines. All personnel entering fighter type aircraft cockpits will ensure personal
items are properly secured to prevent FOD. The wearing of wigs, hairpieces, metal hair fasteners
earrings or any other jewelry in high FOD potential areas is prohibited.
4.7. Individuals must wear coveralls without pockets or buttons (bunny suit) when physical
entry is needed to perform maintenance or inspection of intake or exhaust areas of aircraft
engines.
4.8. Inspections of 88 ABW/CE snow removal equipment will be conducted at the end of
each shift or if equipment malfunction is suspected. Anytime hardware or equipment items
are discovered missing within aircraft operations or maintenance areas, the following
notifications will be initiated:
   4.8.1. Airfield Management Operations (all areas).
   4.8.2. 88 MSG/LGRM Transient Maintenance Operations Control Center (East ramp aircraft
   maintenance and parking areas).
   4.8.3. 445 AW Maintenance Operations Control Center (West ramp aircraft maintenance
   and parking areas).
   4.8.4. 55 MXS Operations Center (East ramp parking location N-1).
   4.8.5. The following information will be provided:
       4.8.5.1. The airfield location and time of equipment operation prior to the missing item
       discovery.
       4.8.5.2. A description of the item missing.
   4.8.6. Once notified, the responsible agency will perform the appropriate search to ensure
   areas remain free of foreign objects.
4.9. Unit FOD Monitors or supervisors: will ensure that all personnel who work in and
around or drive through operational areas of the airfield receive an initial FOD prevention
briefing.
4.10. Escorts of visiting personnel will ensure FOD prevention measures are taken.
