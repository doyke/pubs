This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 32-70, Environmental Quality and AFI 10-2501,
Full Spectrum Threat Response (FSTR) Planning and Operations. It identifies requirements for investi-

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
Deletes petroleum, oils, and lubricants (POL), a dds inspection, and ozone depleting substances (ODS)
(paragraph 2.1); modifies verbiage in each category on the FINE ro w and renames it EA and deletes the
POL and INSPECTION rows (Figure 1). A bar (|) in the left margin indicates revision from previous edi-
tion.


1. Objective. Minimize the frequency and severity of environmental incidents. Environmental incidents
are evaluated to determine cause and to provide r ecommended corrective actions to prevent their re cur-
rence. Through the use of the environmental Notice to Airmen (NOTAM), lessons learned are distributed
throughout the Air Force to ensure bases take the nece ssary steps to prevent a s imilar incident at their
installation.

2. Concept. The purpose of the Environmental Incident Investigation Board (E IIB) is to investigate the
facts and circumstances that led to the occurrence o f an environmental incident at an AETC installatioC

The wing or installation commander will assign an EIIB for all category 1, 2, and 3 incidents as defined in
Figure 1., except as noted in paragraph 2.3.

   2.1. Any one of the five conditions (enforcement act ion [EA], cost, risk, ozone depleting substances
   [ODS] or other) listed in Figure 1. will trigger the associated category. The wing or installation com-
   mander will decide if cate gory 4 incidents warrant an EIIB. The ca tegory of incident will determine
   the level of investigation and reporting.
   2.2. The incident should be investigated thoroughly to ascertain the cause of the incident, and provide
   positive feedback to the command to prevent recurrence. The EIIB pr epares an incident rep ort and
   draft NOTAM, and submits them through the wing or installation commander. The wing or installa-
   tion commander ensures the incident report is forwarded to HQ AETC/CV. The EIIB chairperson will
   brief category 1 inc idents to HQ AETC/CV. HQ AETC/CE will issue an environmental NOT AM
   based on the findings of the EIIB. The NOTAM is sent to all applic able offices Air Force-wide, and
   will contain lessons learned and recommendations to prevent recurrence.
   2.3. Natural disasters, or other acts of God wh ich directly cause envir onmental incidents and/or
   releases, do not generally require investigation under EIIB procedures. However, if a response to an
   environmental incident caused by such a natural disaster is poorly ma naged, or systems fail to func-
   tion as designed, or mitigation of the environmental release is not accomplished, then an EIIB may be
   required. Consult with HQ AETC/C EV for a decision on whether EIIB is requ ired after a natural
   disaster caused incident and/or release.

3. HQ AETC/CE Responsibilities:
   3.1. Develop policy, procedures, and guidance for the EIIB process.
   3.2. Distribute lessons learned and recommendations to prevent recurrence to applicable of fices
   AF-wide.
   3.3. Maintain a record of each environmental incident in accordance with AFMAN 37-123.
   3.4. Review and/or approve requests for waivers or extensions to EIIB process.

4. Wing or Installation Commander Responsibilities (see Attachment 2 for checklist):
   4.1. Determine the incident category in accordance with Figure 1.
   4.2. Immediately notify AETC/CV for categories 1 and 2 environmental incidents. Followup imme-
   diate phone noti fication with a fax or e-mail (copy to HQ AETC/C E, CEV, and CEVQ) w ithin two
   working days of the incident with all available information known at that time.
   4.3. Ensure the wing staff judge advocate (SJA), public affairs (PA), safety (SE) and local detachment
   of the office of special investigations (OSI) are notified, and jointly clear the incident site and/or back-
   ground data before any environmental investigation proceeds.
   4.4. For Cla ss I ODS unplanne d release incidents, provide a fa x or e-mail (copy to H Q AETC/
   LG-EMT for weapon systems or to HQ AETC/CEVQ fo r facilities) within two working days of the
   incident with all available information known at that time.
   4.5. Appoint EIIB members for category 1, 2, and 3 incidents based on Figure 2.

       5.1.1. Coordinate activities with the Safety Investigation Board and Accident Investigation Board
       as applicable. The Safety Investigation Board has priority over other investigations (in accordance
       with AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports).
       5.1.2. Cease investigation pending the outcome of any OSI and SJA investigation, if data and/or

       future OSI investigation.
    5.2. Recommend corrective actions that may prevent recurrence of similar incidents at other installa-

   light or until an EIIB begins its investigation.
   6.2. Act as a facilitator in forming the EIIB.
   6.3. Provide HQ AETC/CEV with EIIB chairperson’s grade, DSN phone number, fax numbe r, and

7. SJA and OSI Responsibilities:
   7.1. Jointly clear an incident site and/or background data before any EIIB proceeds. Determine there
   will be no conflict between the EIIB investigation and any separate investigation. As needed, conduct
   OSI investigation separate and distinct from an EIIB evaluation; however, both investigations may be
   conducted simultaneously so long as coordination with EIIB ensures proper sequencing of investiga-
   tive objectives.
       7.1.1. JA shall review the initial facts and circumstances of the incident to determine potential lia-
       bility, and the appropriateness of conducting an investigation under EIIB procedures.
       7.1.2. Notify the EIIB members th ey are cleared to pr oceed once OSI and JA provide clearance
       and/or legal restrictions have been identified.
   7.2. Brief all EIIB members prior to beginning the EIIB evaluation w ith basic training on investiga-
   tion techniques. JA shall inform E IIB members that the EIIB is not a criminal or legal investigation,
   but an investigation to determine the factors leading to an environmental incident to prevent its recur-
   rence, and to improve re sponse procedures to redu ce the impact of incident s that may occur in the
   future. As such, it is generally unnecessary to info rm interviewees of their rights under Article 31 of
   the Uniform Code of Military Justice or the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

8. PA Responsibilities:
   8.1. Eval uate need for publ ic release of incident, and prepare qu estions and answers for potent ial
   media queries. Coordinate response s to anticipated questions with appropriate agencies/directorates
   before EIIB releases any findings.
   8.2. Publicize investigat ion findings through base newspapers, topics fo r commander’s call, and
   Armed Forces Radio and Television Services to educate personnel on preventing future occurrences.

Air Force, as soon as possible according to local procedures. A message detailing the incident will follow
within 24 hours of verbal notification.

    12.1. Reportabl e quantity references (individual chemicals) are listed on the Extremely Hazardous
    Substance list in 40 CFR 355.40, Appe ndixes A and B, and the Comprehensive Environmental
    Response, Compensation, and Liability Act list in 40 CFR 302.4.
    12.2. Wing or installation commander or designee will determine the category of an incident based on
    Figure 1. Some incidents may fit multip le columns. Check each column and select worst-case cate-
    gory rating (category 1 being worst).
