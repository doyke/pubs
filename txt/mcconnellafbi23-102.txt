MCCONNELLAFBI23-102 5 JANUARY 2011                                                             3


      2.5.2. Leave "Seller" section blank and mark Block 20 as follows: "Standard Form 44
      not provided to merchant." Insert merchant's delivery ticket number.
      2.5.3. Attach a copy of delivery ticket to Standard Form 44.
      2.5.4. If problems with a merchant are encountered, make a note and place it inside the
      AF Form 664. Write "Attention WRDCO" on the note. Include type of payment made.
      2.5.5. If merchant does not provide a signature, write: "merchant refused to sign" in
      block 20 of Standard Form 44. NOTE: Do not sign purchase orders or invoices of
      merchants for foreign governments if a Standard Form 44 was used to purchase fuel
      or services. When a merchant requires both Standard Form 44 and their own
      invoices, both forms should be clearly marked to indicate duplicate forms were
      provided. This will prevent duplicate payments. Do not sign Standard Form 44 and
      AIR Card receipt for the same purchase, sign one or the other. If the merchant
      insists on signatures upon both receipts, notify the WRDCO promptly upon return
      to home station.
   2.6. Purchases at Canadian into-plane contract locations (i.e. Gander, Newfoundland) will be
   documented using a local merchant's invoice. Standard Form 44 and AIR Card will not be
   used. This is the only time the AIR Card will not be used for fuel purchases at a commercial
   location. Contractors will provide the crew with a copy of the invoice. Log the transaction
   and place a copy of invoice inside AF Form 664.
   2.7. Purchases at Shell International Trading Company (SITCO) agreement locations require
   presenting the aircraft identaplate. The invoice must include: date of transaction, grade of
   product, quantity issued or defueled, unit of measure, and signature of Air Force
   representative. If the merchant also requires a Standard Form 44 in addition to their invoice,
   annotate on merchant's invoice "AF Forms executed: Reference merchant invoice #__". Log
   and place all documentation inside AF Form 664.
   2.8. Purchases at commercial airfields are accomplished using the AIR Card first, then
   Standard Form 44. Refer to DESC-I-31, Purchase of Aviation Fuel and Services at
   Commercial Location and Attachment 2 of this instruction for guidelines on completing
   Standard Form 44.
   2.9. Purchases at foreign military airfields, including Replacement-In-Kind (RIK.) locations,
   use host nation forms to record purchases. Information from the aircraft's identaplate should
   be hand scribed on host nation forms. Log and place a copy inside AF Form 664. NOTE: If
   contractors insist on completing their own forms or invoices in addition to DD Form
   1898 Airfuels Into-Plane Sales Slip, the invoice must be annotated "Duplicate DD Form
   1898 accomplished, reference DD Form 1898 “Serial Number." Instructions for
   completing the DD Form 1898 are located in Attachment 4.

           4.1.2.2. The Boom Operator will record in-flight off-loads on the DD Form 791,
           IAW AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, Volume 1, Part 3. See Attachment 3
           for further guidance.
       4.1.3. US Air Force, US Marine Corps, and US Navy Tail Numbers: Aircraft
       Commanders will ensure tail numbers of receivers are verified after flight by the Boom
       Operator using USAF and USN/USMC Reliability and Maintainability Information
       System Spreadsheets (REMIS) available at Maintenance Debrief. Attempt to resolve tail
       number discrepancies with offending unit(s) at the earliest opportunity. Using REMIS
       will identify errors early and allow 22 ARW to recover a significant amount of fuel
       charges.
       4.1.4. In-flight issues from tanker to other aircraft will be recorded on DD Form 791, by
       the tanker Boom Operator, using AMCART.
       4.1.5. Boom Operators will ensure they have a blank DD Form 791, prior to departure
       for in-flight refueling missions. In-flight issues may be consolidated for multiple contacts
       with the same tail number during the same leg, however receiver units prefer separate
       entries to expedite reconciliation of their monthly fuel bill.

       4.1.6. Prior to a scheduled in-flight refueling mission, Boom Operators should obtain
       information about aircraft to be refueled. All available mission profile information will be
       utilized and entered on DD Form 791. Do not rely on the receiver's home station as an
       indicator of the possessing MAJCOM, they may have other MAJCOM's aircraft attached
       to them. Do not rely on the accuracy of AMCART because the ownership table is only
       updated once a year.
           4.1.6.1. Obtain receiver information in-flight using the following means:
               4.1.6.1.1. Visually, if receiver has tail numbers clearly visible.
           4.1.6.2. By boom interphone on aircraft so equipped.
               4.1.6.2.1. By aircraft radio, if communications will not compromise EMISSION
               OPTION 2, 3, or 4. Inter-plane radios will not be used during actual EMCON 2,
               3, or 4 to obtain or verify air-refueling data, unless specifically authorized by
               competent authority. Utilizing HAVE QUICK II and/or Secure Voice should be
               considered. NOTE: Under NO circumstances will any of this data be obtained
               by any of the aforementioned means if it interferes with or threatens safety of
               flight.
           4.1.6.3. During post mission aircrew debrief, the Boom Operator will insure all
           information on DD Form 791 is correct and complete by validating with REMIS.
               4.1.6.3.1. After validation with REMIS the Boom Operator will enter the
               transactions in AMCART. Manually prepared DD Form 791 must be entered into
               AMCART to be processed.
       4.1.7. Post-Mission Paperwork. Completed fuel documentation forms (DD Form 791 and
       AFTO Form 781H) will be included with post-mission paperwork and forwarded to the
       Consolidated Squadron Operations Center (CSOC) for review. The CSOC will review
       forms for completeness and accuracy no later than 1200L the next duty day. Incorrect or
       incomplete documents will returned to squadrons for correction. AF Form 664 with all
       receipts will be turned into Maintenance Debrief upon completion of mission. NOTE:
       The Aircraft Commander is ultimately responsible to ensure all paper work is
       complete and all forms are turned into CSOC and Maintenance Debrief at mission
       completion.
    4.2. KC-135 off-station fuel:
    4.2.1. The refueling operator will record off-station fuel on DD form 1898, Off-Station Fuel
    Sales Slip, IAW DOD 4140.25-m, Management of Bulk Petroleum Products, Natural Gas,
    Coal, or commercial invoice.
       4.2.2. Crew Chief will ensure they have a DD Form 1898, prior to departure for off-
       station refuel.
       4.2.3. Prior to receiving fuel, the Crew Chief should obtain information of the aircraft
       information and billing address.
       4.2.4. After fueling occurs, the refueling operator will give Crew Chief the DD form
       1898. The Crew Chief will ensure all blocks of DD form 1898 are correctly filled out
MCCONNELLAFBI23-102 5 JANUARY 2011                                                              7


      before signing the receipt. (see attachment 4 for instructions of completing DD form
      1898).
      4.2.5. The Crew Chief will place the DD form 1898 into a clear zipper folder inside the
      forms book and annotate the AF 664 for any fuel or services provided. (see Table 4 for
      completion of AF form 664).
   4.2.6. During post mission aircrew debrief, Maintenance Debrief will quality check all AF
   form 664 entries and accompanying receipts for accuracy and legibility. Place all fuel
   receipts and supporting documents into the AF form 664 and put into the fuel receipts drop
   file.
   4.2.7. The WRDCO will pick up the AF form 664 from Maintenance Debrief and file them
   by month.
5. Maintenance Procedures.
   5.1. Maintenance Personnel will:
      5.1.1. Appoint an AVPOL advisory group representative.
      5.1.2. Ensure each assigned aircraft has a valid DD Form 1896, AIR Card, and that these
      items are in the Forms book. Validate the DODAAC, C1C, ORG, and tail number for
      each aircraft assigned. Notify the local Base Fuels Management Flight (LGRF)
      immediately upon inter/intra-aircraft transfer or other changes that would require a new
      identaplate issued for the aircraft. Example: If all 22 ARW aircraft deploying to a Tanker
      Task Force were to become assets of that theater commander and fuel liability would rest
      with same, then a new DD Form 1896 would be cut for this event.
          5.1.2.1. If AIR Card is lost enroute, make an entry on the AF Form 781A. Document
          search results and all relevant details.
          5.1.2.2. If AIR Card is missing from a deployed aircraft, inform maintenance
          supervision and document missing card in the AF Form 781A.
          5.1.2.3. In either case call 1-866-308-3811 inform AIR Card support team the AIR
          Card for the aircraft is lost. The technician will give you a new card number to use for
          the remainder of the mission. Upon return to home station, notify LGRF that the
          AIRCARD was lost.
      5.1.3. Prior to deployment, ensure an adequate supply of fuels transaction documents are
      onboard the aircraft to complete the deployment. Ensure each aircraft has a sufficient
      supply of AF Form 664, for each mission.
   5.2. Maintenance Debrief will:
      5.2.1. Ensure all flying hours and fuels issue data are recorded accurately on AFTO
      Form 781, and AFTO Form 781H. Make sure AFTO Form 781H, Block 17, "Servicing
      Certification", reflects name, spelled out, of location where fuel servicing occurred.
      Abbreviations will not be used.
      5.2.2. Verify that AIR Card is turned in with “Forms” book during post-mission debrief.
      5.2.3. Quality check all DD Form 1898, or equivalent document, and corresponding
      entries on AF Form 664.

        5.2.4. Place the verified AF Form 664 in Fuel Receipt drop-file for pickup.
        5.2.5. Inventory AIRCards monthly to ensure accountability and that inactive cards are
        destroyed.
6. Base Fuels Management (LGRF).
     6.1. Base Fuels Management will:
        6.1.1. Appoint an AVPOL Advisory Group representative.
        6.1.2. Process all fuel off-load documentation once approved by the WRDCO in
