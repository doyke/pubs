6.3.1. Program Documentation. Maintain all requisite exams, including Qual Closed, Qual
Open, Instrument, Mission, FCF, and Marshaling Exam using 20 AF Question Data Banks
(QDBs) on PEX. 341 OG/OGVH or 40 HS/CCV personnel will administer all requisite
examinations.
6.3.3. Retention of Examination Records. The results of an examination will be recorded on
the individuals AF Form 4068 (see supplement paragraph 5.2.). Completed AF Form 4068s will
be temporarily filed in the examinees FEF until the AF Form 8 is completed and filed
permanently. Additionally, examination results are maintained in PEX, PEX access is restricted
to authorized personnel only. The cabinet containing FEFs will be kept locked unless access is

OG/OGVH and 40 HS/CCV will be the only offices that can proctor exams.
6.8.1. Boldface/CAPs. Examinee will complete Boldface following the evaluator pre-brief.
Examiners will grade the boldface sheet as soon as the examinee completes it. Failures will be
handled IAW AFI11-202V2 paragraph 6.9.3

program. 341 OG/OGVH and 40 HS/CCV personnel develop tests using question banks
developed by OGVH and CCV personnel and from questions written by unit aircrew members.
Local tests are developed and administered at a frequency determined by the 40 HS/CC. Tests
may be either open or closed book and they are normally administered in PEX using the standard
PEX database. Tests with secure information will be administered on paper and controlled by 40
HS Tactics. Individual test scores/averages and overall unit averages are maintained in an
electronic test tracker. OGVH and CCV personnel will review the testing data for trends in
knowledge deficiencies and share this data with DOT for discussion at unit instructor meetings.
Minimum passing score for each test varies and is determined for each test, members will retest
until they achieve the minimum passing score. Identify individuals failing to maintain an 85%
average on all testing will report to the 40 HS/CC or 40 HS/DO for counseling. These
individuals may be held back from anticipated flying upgrades until test grades improve. The
unit goal for all tests combined is a 90% average. In addition to the above testing, unit personnel
are also required to complete BOLDFACE and OPS LIMITS sheets on the first and fifteenth
flying day of each month and sign the associated FCIF in PEX.
AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_I_341MWSUP 4 JUNE 2013                                                       5


7.3.7.6. Additional Reviews (Optional). Prior to the Reviewing Officer signing the Form 8,
341 OG/OGVH will initial in the comments block of the AF Form 8 upon completion of their
review. Document this review as follows on the Form 8:

                          Additional Review:
                             341 OG/OGVH: ________ (Initials).

7.3.8.1. All evaluators should promptly complete the AF Form 8. If unable to do so, the
evaluator must include any unique events/information they would like included in the examiner
comments on the AF Form 4068. CCV personnel will complete the Form 8 as quickly as
possible and submit to the evaluator for their review prior to further processing.
7.6.7. Unit Supplement. When there is a change in certification made on the AF Form 4348, an
AF Form 4324 is generated documenting the change and signed by 40 HS/CC, 40 HS/DOT, and
40 HS/CCV. The AF Form 4324s are then submitted to HARM personnel for input into ARMS.
Additionally the squadron Letter of Xs further verifies aircrew certifications. Certifications
maintained by 40 HS are as follows: AIE, Aircraft Commander, Evaluator, Functional Check
Flight (AC), and Functional Check Flight (P/FE). The certifying official for all AF Form 4348s
is the 40 HS/CC.
7.8.5.2. Posting Review. Conduct annual FEF reviews during the aircrew member’s birth
month. FEF reviews will include checking the accuracy of all AF Forms 8, Memorandums for
Record, AF Forms 942, AF Forms 4348, and examiner appointment letters (if applicable) since
the last review was conducted. Do not correct FEF entries made under old or outdated guidance
for format; however, review entries for proper expiration dates of qualification to ensure aircrew
members are flying within the qualification levels, certifications, and restrictions annotated in
their FEFs. Document discrepancies found on an MFR, annotate “Annual Review” on the AF
Form 942 and file all documents in the individual’s FEF.
7.8.6.2. Minor Discrepancies. When a minor discrepancy is discovered to an AF Form 8, AF
Form 942, AF Form 1381, or MFR, document the discrepancy on an MFR, include the
associated AFI11-202 V2 reference, and file in the FEF. If the discrepancy involves an AF Form
942, AF Form 1381, or an MFR that can be re-signed, correct the error.
9.3. Go/No-Go Procedures. 40 HS/CCV administers the go/no-go program in conjunction with
individual aircrew members, 40 HS/DO, 40 HS/DOT and 40 HS/ARMS. All reports are
contained within the go/no-go book located at the operations duty desk. 40 HS/ARMS update
grounding and training restrictions reports daily. Individuals are required to review their
individual training/currency reports weekly to ensure completion of training/currency items prior
to their expiration. 40 HS/ARMS update individual aircrew reports weekly. When off station,
aircraft commanders are responsible for contacting the 40 HS Operations Desk to update FCIF
part B/C information and Ops notes prior to departure, the most current FCIF number will be
documented on the crew’s flight authorization. When aircrew not assigned/attached to 40 HS
are flying with unit aircrews, 40 HS/ARMS will contact the appropriate flying unit and obtain
the necessary documentation to verify go/no-go items. Place these documents in the go/no-go
book with unit documentation. In addition, the flight authorizing official will review the unit
letter of X’s prior to signing the flight authorization to ensure the crew is qualified/certified in
the intended mission. Ensure an instructor is assigned to the crew and properly coded when
 6                                  AFI11-202V2_AFGSCSUP_I_341MWSUP 4 JUNE 2013


unqualified/uncertified or non-current individuals are on the flight authorization. Ensure
instructors are properly coded on upgrade/training flights. Aircraft commanders are the last line
of defense for ensuring aircrews are current and qualified. The aircraft commander review is
especially critical when a crewmember change occurs after the flight-authorizing official signs
the flight authorization.
9.3.1.2. Aircrew physical, physiological training, egress training and current Aeronautical Order
items IAW AFI11-401 are listed on the “Grounding Currency Reports” in the Go/No-Go book.
40 HS/ARMS review these when preparing the flight authorization.
9.3.1.3. Stan/Eval examination items required for flight from AFI11-202 V2 AFGSC Sup are
listed on the “Training Restrictions Browser” in the Go/No-Go book, PEX and the evaluation
eligibility spreadsheet posted outside the CCV office. 40 HS/ARMS review these when
preparing the flight authorization. 40 HS/CCV, 40 HS/DO and unit schedulers review these
during the weekly scheduling meeting.
9.3.1.4. Aircrew DNIF status is included on the “Grounding Currency Reports” and in PEX. 40
HS/ARMS and the supervisor of flying (SOF) update this status daily each morning.
9.4. Supplementary Evaluations. 341 OG/OGVH will accomplish supplemental evaluations
of the areas listed in AFI11-202V2 paragraph 9.4.7. 341 OG/OGVH will use the checklists
provided on the 20 AF Helicopter Sharepoint, and they will provide the 40 HS/CC a
Memorandum For Record documenting the findings and potential corrective actions. 341
OG/OGVH will maintain a copy of the memorandum for one year. 341 OG/OGVH will brief
the results of supplemental evaluations to the 341 OG/CC during SEBs.
