                                             Chapter 1

                                    PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Purpose. Minimize loss of Air Force resources and protect Air Force people from death,
injuries or illnesses by managing risks on- and off-duty. This program applies to all operations
except where otherwise prescribed or specified in Status-of-Forces Agreements.
1.2. Mishap Prevention Program. Commanders at all levels are responsible for developing
and implementing a mishap prevention program. Safety staffs at all levels assist commanders
with the implementation and integration of risk management into all on-duty operations and
missions, and off-duty activities.
1.3. Mishap Prevention Program Disciplines (Aviation, Ground, etc. ). Each mishap
prevention program discipline will have a more detailed description of functional management
responsibilities and risk management processes in specific AFIs, standards and manuals. Air
Force Host and Tenant safety offices will implement this program in accordance with (IAW) the
requirements of this instruction. Any inter-organization and inter-service agreements will be
addressed in support agreements. Regardless of any support agreement or executive agency
guidelines, requirements for this instruction must be satisfied. Mishap prevention programs will
address:
     1.3.1. Target groups at increased risk for mishaps, injury or illness as directed by the
     commander.
     1.3.2. Process for tracking and trending incidents, as well as methods for determining
     program effectiveness.
     1.3.3. Funding for safety programs.
     1.3.4. Metrics for measuring performance (See examples in Chapter 5).
     1.3.5. Safety goals, objectives and milestones that support Air Force established goals.
     1.3.6. Methods to identify and disseminate safety “best practices.”
1.4. Applying Standards. All Air Force units must comply with applicable safety guidance
during all Air Force operations. MAJCOMs, DRUs and FOAs may supplement Air Force
Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) guidance when additional or more stringent safety,
fire prevention and health criteria are required. When there is conflicting guidance, use the
guidance that provides the most protection.
     1.4.1. The Air Force publishes industrial and general ground safety guidance as Air Force
     instructions, which implement Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
     standards. Area-specific instructions and technical data include other safety criteria. When
     AFOSH guidance or safety criteria do not cover a situation, use non-Air Force standards
     including national consensus standards, professional safety and health standards, and other
     Federal agency standards. Air Force activities must comply with OSHA requirements at all
     times unless the military-unique exemption applies according to DoDI 6055.1, DoD Safety
     and Occupational Health Program, paragraph E3.4.5. NOTE: AFOSH guidance must be
     followed at all times. They implement parts of OSHA 29 Code of Federal Regulations
AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013                                                                 9


   (CFR), and include additional requirements not addressed by the OSHA standards. In
   addition, safety, fire prevention and occupational health requirements in equipment technical
   orders (TO) must be followed at all times.
   1.4.2. Commanders, functional managers, supervisors and individuals must support and
   comply with mishap prevention programs. An effective program depends on individual
   integration of mishap prevention program responsibilities. Safety committees should be
   considered at all levels of program integration. Risk management at all functional levels both
   on- and off-duty must meet minimum safety requirements and should be working towards
   exceeding them with an ultimate goal of achieving zero mishaps.
   1.4.3. Commanders, functional managers and supervisors at all levels will establish specific
   procedures and measurements to ensure compliance with program standards.

      1.5.22.12. Hand carry the AF Form 55 or equivalent product to the new supervisor when
      deploying or transferring to another Air Force position/location.
1.6. General Guidance Related to Recording Occupational Injuries and Illnesses.
   1.6.1. Executive Order 12196, Occupational Safety and Health Program for Federal
   Employees, requires federal agencies to report occupational mishaps to the Secretary of
   Labor. 29 CFR 1960, Basic Program Elements for Federal Employee Occupational Safety
   and Health Programs and Related Matters, and 29 CFR 1904, Recording and Reporting
   Occupational Injuries and Illness, set requirements and provide standard forms for
   documenting occupational illnesses and injuries.
   1.6.2. The host ground safety staff is the official Air Force office of record for maintaining
   occupational illness and injury data and maintains consolidated records of injuries and illness
   meeting mishap Class A, B, C and D criteria. AFSAS will be used to record mishaps
   involving injury and illnesses to on- and off-duty Air Force military and on-duty civilian
AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013                                                           29


  personnel to generate separate OSHA Form 300s, Log of Work-Related Injuries and
  Illnesses.
  1.6.3. Safety will record Class A - D occupational injuries and Public Health will record
  occupational illnesses within seven calendar days of notification using AFSAS. Illnesses
  require an investigation and final determination by a provider before they are confirmed
  occupational illnesses. Once confirmed (in AFSAS), the case should be closed and recorded
  within seven (7) days. The MTF clinical elements will provide injury data to safety on a
  routine basis as information is discovered. (See paragraph 1.5.17.3-4.)
  1.6.4. Installation Ground Safety will maintain consolidated occupational illness and injury
  logs to satisfy the OSHA requirement for single-point access to occupational illness and
  injury cases. Tenant units will provide the host safety office a summary of civilian and
  military occupational injuries/illnesses data by the third workday each month (if not
  otherwise accessible, e.g., AFSAS).

                                 SAFETY ORGANIZATION

2.1. Safety Staff. All safety disciplines will be consolidated under a single Chief of Safety
(COS). Full-time safety personnel must be trained and qualified to manage safety programs, and
be able to function at the staff level. Use the Air Force Manpower Standard (AFMS) 106A to
determine the size of the safety staff. AFRC units use applicable AFRC Command Manpower
Standard or Guides to determine safety staff size. All safety manpower requests or changes will
be coordinated with the MAJCOM/SE before submission to the local management engineering
team. Manpower variances can be submitted for safety staffs that conduct special programs IAW
AFMS 106A.
2.1. (AFSOC)Safety Staff. Units without an authorized safety position will appoint primary
and alternate collateral duty ground, flight, and weapons safety representative, as applicable to
their mission. The representative may be responsible for more than one discipline and may be an
officer, NCO (staff sergeant or above), or civilian employee. Training for collateral duty safety
personnel is IAW AFI 91-202, Attachment 14. Duties are prescribed in AFI 91-202, Chapter
7, Chapter 8, and Chapter 9. AFSOC wings/groups without an authorized weapons safety
position will appoint the most knowledgeable munitions, weapons or the ground safety manager
as the collateral duty weapons safety officer/NCO.
   2.1.1. Chief of Safety. The COS reports directly to the commander (or Director in a civilian-
   led unit) and manages the mishap prevention program for the commander (e.g. installation,
   center, NAF/MAJCOM commanders). The COS must be qualified in a primary mission
   weapons system of the unit or if the COS is a civilian position, have a Safety Officer who is
   qualified in a primary mission weapon system. Civilian COS must meet the qualification
   standards for Occupational and Health professional stated in the Office of Personnel
   Management (OPM) classification series, GS-0018 or GS-0803. MAJCOM Chiefs of Safety
   should have previous safety experience. The AFRC equivalents to the above are AFRC Air
   Reserve Technician (ART) COS which are 2181-series (pilot)/2183-series (navigator)
   civilians.
       2.1.1.1. Active duty military COS will be either on a current or previous Squadron
       Commander list or an individual the Wing Commander intends to support for the
       Squadron Commander list, or a former Squadron Commander. MAJCOM/CV or above
       has waiver authority for this requirement.
       2.1.1.2. Assigned individuals must complete the Chief of Safety Course (WCIP05B)
       within 90 days of assuming the COS position. Air Force Reserve and ANG COSs may
       substitute the Air Reserve Component Chief of Safety course (ARCCOS) (WCIP05K)
       and should make every effort to complete the requirement within 90 days of assuming the
       COS position. However, in no case will Air Force Reserve and ANG components exceed
       a 180 day limit. Waiver authority for this requirement is HQ AFSC/SEF.
       2.1.1.3. Assigned individuals must be available to serve as COS for a minimum of one
       year after completion of training.
   2.1.2. Career Safety Professional. The Air Force has an enlisted safety career field (Air
   Force Specialty Code (AFSC) 1S0X1) and a civilian safety career field (GS-0018,
AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013                                                               31


  Occupational Safety and Health Manager or Specialist, GS-0019, Safety Technician GS-
  0017, Weapons Safety Specialist, and GS-0803, Safety Engineer). These career safety
  personnel are assigned to positions authorized by the Unit Manning Document. The safety
  career field is addressed in AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and
  Enlisted), and described in the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD). The
  civilian safety career program is described in AFI 36-601, Air Force Civilian Career
  Program Management.
     2.1.2.1. Professional Continuing Education and Training. Fulltime safety professionals in
     ground safety positions, in addition to having met the OPM 017/018/019/803 or AFI 36-
     2101 qualification standards, must complete at least three safety-related continuing
     education units (CEU) per year, with one CEU equaling ten contact hours of course
     participation. Other fulltime safety professionals in weapons, space and flight disciplines
     should use this requirement to remain up to date in their specialty as well.
         2.1.2.1.1. Professional continuing education and training is not the same as
         qualification training where an individual could be decertified, downgraded or unable
         to deploy, etc., if not trained to a specific level. The purpose of continuing education
         and training is to help safety professionals expand their knowledge base and stay
         informed on the latest technical and behavioral developments in the field of safety.
         2.1.2.1.2. College, OPM and other safety professional development courses that do
         not award CEUs, e.g., on-line training, may be used to satisfy this requirement, if
         approved by the Ground Safety Manager. MAJCOM/SEs or their designee may grant
         waivers for this requirement for reasons to include personnel on extended
         deployments, manning shortfalls and funding limitations. The COS will document
         specific circumstances and conditions when this training cannot be met.
     2.1.2.2. Attachment 13 contains a partial list of recommended safety courses that safety
     professionals should consider when meeting CEU requirements. Safety managers will
     plan, program and budget for safety resources (e.g., to include sufficient safety training to
     meet CEU requirements).
     2.1.2.3. It is highly desirable for safety professionals to obtain Occupational Health and
     Safety Technologist (general industry), Construction Health and Safety Technician
     (construction) and Certified Safety Professional certifications from the Board of Certified
     Safety Professionals (www.bcsp.org) or other recognized national/international
     organizations.
  2.1.3. Ground Safety Manager (GSM). The GSM manages the ground safety program for the
  Chief of Safety and the commander (e.g., installation, center, NAF/MAJCOM commanders).
  The GSM must be fully qualified to advise and execute decisions on safety matters for the
  primary mission of the unit. The GSM should complete the Safety Managers Course (AFSC
  Course WCIP05D) prior to assuming duties as a GSM. Individuals who cannot attend prior
  to assuming duties will complete the course within one year.
  2.1.4. Flight Safety Officer (FSO). Full-time FSOs (military and civilian Flight Safety
  Managers (FSMs) [GS-0018]) are assigned to positions authorized by the Manpower
  Standard (AFMS). FSOs at squadron and installation level must be current in a unit mission
  aircraft (N/A for FSMs). FSOs in higher headquarters positions will be rated officers or prior

     2.1.4.1. Full-time FSOs (wing level and above) must complete Aircraft Mishap
     Investigation Course (AMIC, WCIP05A) and Aviation Safety Program Management
     course (ASPM, WCIP09B). FSMs may complete AMIC but not required to complete
     ASPM. This training should be completed within 90 days of appointment, but must be
     completed no later than 180 days from appointment. AFRC and ANG FSOs may fulfill
     this requirement by attending Aircraft Mishap Investigation Course (AMIC, WCIP05A)
     and the Air National Guard Chief of Safety/Air Reserve Component Chief of Safety
     course (ARCCOS, WCIP05K).
         2.1.4.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Candidates for the FSO course must have 4 years rated
         experience prior to course start unless a waiver is granted by HQ AFSOC/SE.
         2.1.4.1.2. (Added-AFSOC) Wing/Groups will track FSO qualified individuals for
         Wing/Group commanders to ensure that FSO school graduates are available to meet
         unit manning document (UMD) and deployed safety manning requirements and to
         ensure continuity in the safety office as required by AFI 91-202. With approval of
         HQ AFSOC/SEF rated officers not in full time safety positions may attend the FSO
         course. In this case, priority for training will be given to individuals projected to
         serve in full time positions.
     2.1.4.2. Commanders of flying squadrons without an authorized FSO will appoint a
     Squadron Assigned Flight Safety Officer (SAFSO) as an additional duty.
     2.1.4.3. SAFSO should attend the ASPM course or AMIC course in conjunction with
     MAJCOM supplemental training.
     2.1.4.4. Where applicable, flight USRs will be trained IAW paragraph 2.2

2.6. Councils and Committees. In accordance with AFI 90-801, the Air Force utilizes the
Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health Councils (ESOHC) to achieve ESOH goals
throughout the Air Force and to provide senior leadership involvement and direction at all levels
of command. This interdisciplinary approach includes aviation, ground, weapons and space
safety.
   2.6.1. AFI 90-801 governs the rules regarding the conduct of Environment, Safety, and
   Occupational Health Councils. The ESOHC reviews policies and programs, establishes
   goals, monitors progress and advises leadership. IAW AFI 90-801, the ESOHC Chair may
   charter an ESOHC Safety Sub-Group to ensure full review and oversight of all safety related
   matters.
       2.6.1.1. If established, Safety Sub-Groups will be chaired by the commander or
       commander’s designee and will convene at the commander’s discretion. The Safety Sub-
       Group will be represented at a minimum by group and squadron commanders from the
       host base, representatives from each 2-letter office and commanders (or their designee)
       from tenant organizations. Union representatives will be invited and encouraged to
       participate.
       2.6.1.2. The safety staff will make all Safety Sub-Group arrangements; develop the
       agenda and distribute it in advance; and record and publish council meeting minutes. The
       Safety Sub-Group agenda and minutes will consider safety-related items addressed in the
       previous ESOHC and the meeting outcomes will be added to the agenda and proceedings
       of the following ESOHC. The chief of safety will ensure the minutes are prepared within
       30 days following a Safety Sub-Group meeting. The Sub-Group chair will approve the
       minutes and all Sub-Group members will be furnished a copy. OPRs will be identified for
       items requiring action.
   2.6.2. Attachment 2 of AFI 90-801 describes the agenda topics to be addressed during the
   ESOH Council. Hazard report analysis will include AF Form 457, as well as Hazardous Air
   Traffic Reports (HATRs). Units that own a flight line but have no assigned aircraft may
   address flight safety BASH, HATR and MACA issues through the Airfield Operations Board
   meetings.
       2.6.2.1. The safety council may be combined with the semi-annual ; however, safety
       councils are conducted quarterly. When safety and ESOH councils are combined, all
       items from AFIs 90-801 and 90-803, and AFI 91-202 will be briefed.
       2.6.2.2. When the installation safety council meets separate from the ESOHC, the safety
       staff will make all safety council arrangements, develop the agenda, distribute the agenda
       in advance and record and publish council meeting minutes. The council chairperson
       approves the minutes and all council members will receive copies. OPRs will be
       identified for items requiring action.
       2.6.2.3. The following agenda items will be covered, as a minimum, for the safety
       discipline at ESOHCs and when a standalone installation safety council meeting is held
       in lieu of an ESOHC:
           2.6.2.3.1. Review safety risk-based performance goals, measures, objectives and
           targets.
AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013                                                               39


           2.6.2.3.2. Review changes in safety program guidelines for implementation and
           improvement.
           2.6.2.3.3. Review the installation master hazard abatement program (RAC 1, 2, 3
           hazards), including unabated safety hazards and the plan of action to correct the
           hazards (must be conducted at least once annually).
           2.6.2.3.4. Review mishap and incident trends, safety initiatives, and applicable
           private sector and other governmental agency best practices.
           2.6.2.3.5. Analysis of mishaps experienced and progress of targeted mishap
           prevention initiatives.
           2.6.2.3.6. Review summaries of the FECA Working Group report and Non-
           Appropriated Funds employee compensation program.
           2.6.2.3.7. Analysis of Hazardous Air Traffic Reporting (HATR) and hazard reports.
           Units that own a flight line but have no assigned aircraft may address flight safety
           BASH, HATR and MACA issues through the Airfield Operations Board meetings.
           2.6.2.3.8. Summary of Department of Defense Measures of Merit (DoDI 6055.1-
           E3.11. Goals, Objectives, Measures of Merit, and Self Evaluation).
           2.6.2.3.9. Summary of inspection and assessment/evaluation results which should
           include findings and corrective actions taken or planned as applicable. Monitor status
           of compliance schedules and indicate the progress.
           2.6.2.3.10. Review appropriate training and manpower requirements.
   2.6.3. Commanders can form safety councils and committees at any level to focus group
   attention on safety or health problems.
2.7. Non-USAF Councils and Committees. The Air Force supports federal, state, and local
safety councils and committees and encourages safety staffs to take part in them.
   2.7.1. (Added-AFSOC) Wing/group safety personnel will participate in the appropriate
   host installation safety councils. AFSOC units at non-AFSOC bases will also conduct
   internal safety councils and committees to keep wing/group commanders informed of
   pertinent safety issues. As a minimum in addition to the requirements of AFI 91-202,
   wing/group safety staffs will brief unit mishaps, follow-up actions, and status of
   recommendations, to key staff at least quarterly. Maintain copies of the minutes on file.
2.8. Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) Safety Programs. MAJCOMs will
establish safety policy for MRTFB and other range activities. The overall goal of the range safety
program is to ensure safety consistent with operational requirements, which includes preventing
test objects, space launch vehicles, or their hazardous effects from violating established limits.
The installation commander of the unit operating the MRTFB is considered the activity
commander. Under the direction of the MAJCOM concerned, the activity commander will:
   2.8.1. Institute a risk management program that quantifies risk and sets requirements for risk
   acceptance.
   2.8.2. Determine safety requirements and ensure all range users are in compliance.

   2.8.3. Establish allowable ground and flight safety conditions and take appropriate action to
   ensure that test articles do not violate the conditions. Where the reliability of the test object is
   not established, appropriate measures should be taken to ensure it will not endanger the
   public or their property.
2.9. Range Safety Programs. Units operating any range facility shall conduct a range safety
program to ensure public safety and protection of government resources and personnel. The
Range Operating Agency (ROA) must identify, mitigate and present residual risks for acceptance
to an appropriate authority prior to any range activity.
   2.9.1. Installation safety offices shall coordinate with the ROA to implement and document
   the risk management process. High residual risk test or range events are typically accepted by
   the installation/activity commander. Inform MAJCOM/A3 and SE of high risk activities prior
   to execution. Approval authorities in coordination with the installation safety office may
   issue local Operating Instructions (OI) IAW AFMAN 91-201 for select or repetitious
   activities.
   2.9.2. ROAs will ensure weapon safety footprints exist for all aircraft, weapons and tactics
   (including those from other services and countries) authorized for a given target and event on
   the range. Otherwise, employment is restricted IAW AFI 13-212, Range Planning and
   Operations.
   2.9.3. When it becomes necessary to destroy assets or terminate a test to protect public
   safety or high value government assets, the installation safety office shall document the
   occurrence and provide an info copy to the MAJCOM/SE.

3.2. Safety Program Evaluations. At least once every 36 months, qualified safety personnel
must evaluate the safety program management of each organization at installation level and
higher. Address waiver to any evaluation requirement directly through SAF/IE to DUSD (ATL),
with courtesy copy to AFSC. These evaluations will cover all safety disciplines. Higher
headquarters (e.g. MAJCOM, NAF, etc.) will develop and revise checklists and a rating system
to assess program compliance and performance for their subordinate units. Whenever possible,
these assessments should be conducted as part of the Environment, Safety and Occupational
Health Compliance Assessment and Management Program (ESOHCAMP) required by AFI 90-
803. Conduct evaluations with prior notice.
   3.2.1. Safety program evaluations address the areas of command and functional manager
   support, compliance with program directives and the effectiveness of mishap prevention
   programs (performance).
   3.2.2. Prepare a written report for each evaluation. Send a copy of the report to the
   commander and safety staff of the organization evaluated.
3.3. Safety Program Assessments. Qualified safety personnel assess the safety program
management of each organization below installation level annually. EXCEPTION:
Organizations with subordinate GSUs, Detachments or Operating Locations (OL) will perform a
safety program assessment of each activity at intervals not to exceed 36 months. These
assessments should cover all safety disciplines.
   3.3.1. Safety assessments, like program evaluations, address the areas of commander and
   supervisory support, compliance with program directives and the effectiveness of mishap
   prevention programs (performance). Assessments may be conducted in conjunction with the
   annual safety inspection.
   3.3.2. Prepare a written report for each assessment. Send a copy of the report to the
   commander of the organization. The evaluation report may be combined with the annual
   inspection report.
   3.3.3. Installations will develop checklists and a qualitative rating system (complies,
   complies with comments, does not comply) to rate program compliance and performance.
   Conduct assessments with prior notice.
3.4. Annual Safety Inspections. Safety inspections help identify hazards and measure
compliance with applicable safety guidance and standards. Annual inspections may be combined
with the annual program assessment. Full-time safety staffs may accomplish risk based
inspections/assessments on units using tools such as the unit assessment tool and evaluation
(URATE) used by some AETC units. Risk based inspections/assessments will be approved by
the command with criteria to support decision to use risk based inspections.
   3.4.1. Scope. At least annually, qualified personnel shall inspect every installation
   workplace/facility. Inspections are to be conducted more frequently based on factors such as
   the exposure to and potential severity of hazards, actual accident experience, special
   emphasis programs, changes in the organization’s staffing or workplaces or other event that
   increases risk in the workplace. Procedures shall be established to document and follow-up
   on the correction of hazards/deficiencies identified during inspections every 30 days (see
   hazard abatement program). Conduct inspections of all workplaces and operations where Air
   Force personnel are regularly employed at fixed installations. Inspections of workplaces and
AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013                                                              43


  operations in contractor facilities (government owned, contractor operated (GOCO) or
  contractor owned/operated) where fewer than 25 Air Force personnel are employed shall be
  at the discretion of the Chief of Safety, based on existing conditions and potential risks.
  Assist the multi-functional team, upon request, to resolve any issues related to the safety of
  the contractor’s facilities.
     3.4.1.1. Facility, workplace and operational inspections. The safety manager will ensure
     safety personnel are properly qualified and/or have been task certified to perform all
     aspects of the inspection, and all facilities assigned to the unit are inspected/documented.
     3.4.1.2. All hazards/deficiencies identified during the inspections will be assigned a RAC
     (if applicable) and the safety staff conducting the inspection will assist the responsible
     supervisor in developing hazard abatement actions.
     3.4.1.3. Checklists will be used to help identify hazards, deficiencies and other work
     related violations. The safety staff will ensure checklists are available to all assigned
     personnel. These checklists will be reviewed at least annually for accuracy and relevancy
     by the safety staff. Method of documentation of the review is determined by the safety
     staff.
         3.4.1.3.1. (Added-AFSOC) Local inspection checklists will be kept current and
         updated as needed.
     3.4.1.4. The host safety staff inspects units that do not have an authorized full-time
     safety position in a particular discipline. The host performs the required annual inspection
     except when support agreement directs otherwise.
     3.4.1.5. Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) with full-time safety personnel will
     inspect workplaces annually and keep a copy of report on file until the next annual
     inspection. For GSUs without a full-time safety staff, the host base safety office conducts
     the annual workplace’s inspection (unless a support agreement specifies otherwise) and
     forwards a copy of report to the GSU and the GSU's parent organization.
     3.4.1.6. Tenant/Associate units with a full-time safety staff (by discipline) will conduct
     annual inspections.
     3.4.1.7. Inspect at least 20 percent of unmanned missile and space launch facilities once
     a year. Select these launch work areas to ensure that a representative segment of the
     unit’s assets are inspected annually. Inspections must be scheduled to ensure all launch
     work areas will be inspected over a 5-year cycle.
  3.4.2. Procedures. Safety staffs will conduct multi-discipline (e.g. Aviation, Ground, etc.)
  inspections when feasible. The safety staff will develop and publish an annual inspection
  schedule and distribute to units no later than 15 December for the upcoming calendar year or
  15 September for the upcoming fiscal year. A copy shall also be provided to union(s), as
  applicable.
     3.4.2.1. Inspectors must consult with workplace personnel and their union
     representatives on matters affecting their safety and health and give them the opportunity
     to identify unsafe and unhealthy working conditions, equipment and practices. Conduct
     such consultations privately and do not identify employees who want to remain
     anonymous.

       3.4.2.2. Provide an out brief to the commander within three duty days and a formal
       written report to the squadron/unit commander within 15 calendar days after completion
       of inspection. COS may waive the time criteria for the formal report as necessary.
       Ensure these reports along with the unit's corrective actions are staffed through the
       installation commander as their policy prescribes. When the host base safety office
       conducts inspections of tenant units, the tenant unit USR will send a copy of the report to
       the parent safety office. Formal inspection reports must contain:
           3.4.2.2.1. The unit, activity or work area inspected.
           3.4.2.2.2. The date of the inspection.
           3.4.2.2.3. Management and supervisory support for safety.
           3.4.2.2.4. Mishap experience and trends.
           3.4.2.2.5. Compliance with safety program directives.

           monthly updates on open items until closure.
           3.4.2.2.10. (Added-AFSOC) Exceptional achievements.
       3.4.2.3. Follow-up procedures and actions. The inspected unit will submit to the safety
       staff corrective actions taken. Safety personnel will track and monitor the status of all
       open inspection findings until closed. Use spot inspections and follow-up reporting to
       ensure corrective action(s) are taken and hazards are mitigated. Transfer hazards
       identified during annual inspections (RACs 1, 2, and 3) not corrected within 30 days to
       the Master Hazard Abatement Plan. RACs 4 or 5 are addressed in Chapter 12 and should
       also be tracked using the hazard abatement program.
3.5. Spot Inspections. Spot inspections are an effective way to find and eliminate transitory
hazards and ensure compliance with safety requirements. Supervisors, USRs and safety
personnel will perform spot inspections to check the day-to-day safety and health of an
organization, work center, facility, etc. See discipline specific chapters for additional operations
and areas that need to be inspected or monitored.
   3.5.1. The Chief of Safety will develop a spot inspection program for safety staff to ensure
   coverage of on- and off-duty activities that occur on, or are controlled by, the installation.
   3.5.2. All Air Force personnel should identify and take action, as appropriate, to eliminate
   hazards in the workplace. USRs and supervisors will ensure documented spot inspections are
   conducted at least monthly to ensure 100% of the workplaces are covered annually.
       3.5.2.1. (Added-AFSOC) Include spot inspections for around the clock operations.
       Each full time safety staff member will actively participate in the spot inspection
       program. Collateral duty safety personnel will perform and document spot inspections of
       work areas within their units. Use a locally generated log to document spot inspections.

       documented until findings are closed.
3.6. High Interest Areas. High interest areas are those areas that have the greatest risk to life or
property damage, have experienced repeated mishaps or in the judgment of the safety office
require added monitoring. They can also be work areas or operations that need additional
attention or inspections because of increased mishap potential due to the nature of the work
performed, physical conditions, or type of materials handled. High interest areas, if identified,
will be designated by the Chief of Safety in writing. Inspections will be accomplished and
documented at least monthly.
   3.6.1. (Added-AFSOC) Unit safety staffs may identify high interest areas and designate
   them in writing. Provide a copy of high interest areas to HQ AFSOC/SE. HQ AFSOC/SE
   may identify additional areas when command experience indicates a need.
3.7. Administrative Areas. Collateral-duty safety personnel who are task-qualified may
conduct inspections of these areas when the safety staff determines the mishap potential is
minimal. The base safety staff develops specific provisions for meeting inspection requirements
(subject to approval by the safety directorate) and conducts over the shoulder assessments of the
collateral-duty personnel to ensure that their safety inspections are sound.
3.8. Special and Seasonal Inspections. Inspections are conducted to ensure work and
recreational environments are safe and healthy for base personnel.
   3.8.1. Special inspections include seasonal, targeted mishap preventive activities, special
   events and mission readiness operations/exercises. Special inspections will be conducted of
   installation child development centers, approved day care homes and play grounds that are
   part of real property. Services will coordinate with the safety staff to inspect at least 10
   percent of all approved home-day-care providers annually.
   3.8.2. Seasonal inspections will be conducted of recreational areas (e.g., sports fields,
   swimming pools, camp grounds, and recreational vehicle parks and other recreational areas).
   Services will coordinate with the safety staff to jointly conduct pre- and post-season
   inspections of seasonal areas. Preseason inspections ensure post-season inspection hazards
   have been corrected and that there are no new hazards. The safety staff will conduct post
 46                                                    AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013


   season inspections to identify any additional hazards, which should be corrected before
   operation.
3.9. Staff Assistance Visits (SAV). The purpose of the SAV program is to help develop
solutions, not to inspect or evaluate and to make recommendations for improvement. Safety
staffs at all command levels visit subordinate units when requested or when problems, personnel
turnover or special issues require on-scene assistance. Provide a written report to the
commander. Do not require replies unless an action started during the visit needs monitoring by
the higher headquarters safety staff or requires further staff action above the level of the visited
unit.
   3.9.1. Staff Assistance Visits may be conducted at any level at any time.
       3.9.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) HQ AFSOC Safety staff will conduct wing/group/direct
       reporting units (DRU) staff assistance visits (SAVs) only at the request of the unit
       commander; all SAVs will be coordinated with the MAJCOM Gatekeeper IAW AFI 90-
       201. SAVs should emphasize command safety issues. SAVs will not be scheduled
       inside 60 days from a formal inspection. A written report will be provided to the
       commander of the unit visited.
   3.9.2. HQ AFSC will conduct SAVs of all MAJCOMs on a continuous rotating basis or as
   requested.
   3.9.3. MAJCOMs may delegate installation staff assistance visits to the NAF.
   3.9.4. SAVs should be conducted to assist units that receive a rating of marginal or
   unsatisfactory during program evaluations, Operational Readiness Inspections (ORI) or Unit
   Compliance Inspections (UCI). The goal of SAVs is to train personnel and develop a road-
   map for program management improvement.
3.10. Environment, Safety and Occupational Health Compliance Assessment and
Management Program (ESOHCAMP).
   3.10.1. Tier 2 and 3 ESOHCAMPs. Safety staffs may use the Tier 2 and 3 ESOHCAMPs as
   an opportunity to conduct a program evaluation of installation safety functions. Similarly,
   MAJCOM safety staffs may partner with the Inspector General to meet program evaluation
   responsibilities. MAJCOM safety staffs will coordinate the scope and content of Tier 2 and 3
   ESOHCAMPs with MAJCOM Safety and Health professionals.
   3.10.2. Tier 1 ESOHCAMP. Installation units (wing, base, center, etc.,) will coordinate the
   scope and content of Tier 1 ESOHCAMPs with installation Occupational, Safety and Health
   professionals (such as Bioenvironmental Engineering, PH and SGP). Tier 1 ESOHCAMPs
   should be used as an opportunity to conduct a self-inspection of installation level programs.
3.11. Department of Labor (DoL) Inspections. OSHA officials may conduct inspections of
nonmilitary-unique workplaces and operations where Air Force civilian personnel work
(inspections may be unannounced). See Chapter 8 for specific requirements.
3.12. Contract Performance Assessment. Installation safety offices will assist the multi-
functional team (MFT) in validating that contractors are meeting the safety requirements of the
contract. The contracting officer is responsible for notifying contractors performing work on the
installation that the installation is pursuing VPP certification.
AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013                                                              47


  3.12.1. The MFT will ensure contractors perform IAW the terms and conditions of the
  contract. Discrepancies will be reported to the MFT via contracting officer’s representative
  (COR). Commanders will ensure CORs that are required to monitor safety requirements are
  trained in the recognition of hazardous conditions/environments, the use of safety and health
  standards, and in other areas of safety, as necessary. The Safety Office will assist
  commanders and CORs in specialized safety training requirements to ensure the COR is
  properly trained to provide oversight of the contract.
  3.12.2. Air Force personnel who note potential safety violation(s) will report the hazard to
  the COR. CORs notify the multi-functional team, and initiate the appropriate actions related
  to violations. Unless there is imminent danger, Air Force personnel should avoid reporting
  safety violations directly to the contractor, but should immediately report observed violations
  to the contracting officer or the installation safety office.
  3.12.3. Inspection of Contractor Work Areas and Government Owned Contractor Operated
  (GOCO) Work Areas. When Air Force personnel conduct safety inspections in contractor
  work areas their primary concern is the potential risks to Air Force personnel and
  government property. Hazardous conditions or violations of safety standards should be
  reported to the contracting officer, the responsible commander or to the installation safety
  office. NOTE: Inspections of workplaces and operations in contractor installations where
  fewer than 25 DoD personnel are employed shall be at the COS’s discretion, based on
  existing conditions and potential risks.
     3.12.3.1. GOCO explosives activities must comply with the applicable portions of DoDI
     4145.26, DoD Contractor’s Safety Requirements for Ammunition and Explosives, to
     assure safety of the activity and the prevention of mishaps.
     3.12.3.2. The requirements documents will require compliance with appropriate
     provisions of DoDD 6055.9-STD, DoD Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards,
     AFMAN 91-201 and this instruction.
 48                                                   AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013


                                          Chapter 4

                     HAZARD IDENTIFICATION AND REPORTING

4.1. Hazard Identification. Mishap prevention depends on personnel identifying, reporting and
correcting hazards promptly and efficiently. Managers or supervisors will not discriminate
against an employee who exercises their right to report hazards. Reports can be submitted
anonymously.
4.2. Reporting Criteria. Submit hazard reports unless personnel can take corrective action
under this instruction or any of these Air Force publications:
   4.2.1. AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program (FMP).
   4.2.2. AFI 51-1101, The Air Force Procurement Fraud Remedies Program.
   4.2.3. AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports.
   4.2.4. T.O. 00-5-1, Air Force Technical Order System.
   4.2.5. T.O. 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting, Investigation and Resolution.
4.3. Hazard Reporting Procedures. Commanders must ensure an AF Form 457, USAF
Hazard Report (HR), or equivalent product is available to all personnel. Any person assigned,
attached or under contract to the Air Force may report a hazard. A hazard report may be
submitted on any event that includes hazards, unsafe procedures, practices or conditions that
affects flight, ground, weapons, systems or space safety. Report hazards to the responsible
supervisor or consult local SE office for guidance.
   4.3.1. If the hazard presents imminent danger, the supervisor or individual responsible for
   that area will take immediate action to mitigate or eliminate the hazard to protect personnel
   or property.
   4.3.2. Report hazards that cannot be eliminated immediately to the installation safety office
   via the AF Form 457, by telephone, e-mail or in person.
   4.3.3. The Chief of Safety will determine the appropriate safety, fire or health discipline to
   investigate the HR. The assigned investigator will investigate the HR within one (1) duty day
   for imminent danger situations, and three (3) duty days for potentially serious situations and
   10 duty days for lesser conditions. The investigator discusses the HR with the member who
   submitted the report (if known), the responsible supervisor or manager and other parties
   involved to validate the hazard and determine the best interim control and corrective action.
   4.3.4. If the hazard is validated:
       4.3.4.1. The investigator assigns a HR control number, a RAC as appropriate and
       monitors all corrective actions until complete.
       4.3.4.2. The investigator completes the HR’s Part II, “Summary of Investigation,” and
       sends it promptly to the individual responsible for making sure corrective action is
       completed and the hazard eliminated or controlled.
       4.3.4.3. The responsible individual completes Part II, “Action Taken,” within 10 working
       days and returns the HR to the safety office for monitoring.
AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013                                                                49


       4.3.4.4. The investigator informs the originator (if known) in writing about the corrective
       action or plans and conducts follow-up reviews until the action is completed. The
       investigator informs the originator, (if known), about the completed action within 10
       workdays after the report is closed. If the originator is not known, inform the supervisor
       or manager of corrective actions.
       4.3.4.5. If the HR response is not satisfactory to the originator, the originator should
       resubmit the report and follow procedures in paragraph 4.5
       4.3.4.6. HRs that generate an AF Form 3, Installation Hazard Abatement Plan, may be
       closed and corrective action monitored through the hazard abatement process.
4.4. Additional Reporting Procedures. Transient personnel unable to report a hazard at a base
where it is found should submit the HR to the next Air Force base they visit, or to the safety
office at their home base. The receiving safety office will send the report to the responsible base
safety offices.
   4.4.1. The safety office sends reports on hazards that cannot be corrected at the local level to
   the agencies that can take appropriate action.
   4.4.2. Tenant personnel send hazard reports involving activities for which the host is
   responsible to the host base safety office for processing.
   4.4.3. Hazard reports requiring urgent action should be transmitted by the most
   expeditionary communication means available (overnight mail, official government email,
   telephone). A written report must be submitted when time permits.
   4.4.4. Persons identifying hazards involving weather forecasting must submit hazard reports
   as soon as possible to ensure that records are not destroyed. Promptly advise the appropriate
   agency providing weather forecasting services, i.e., installation weather flight/detachment
   supporting operational weather squadron, etc., of their intention to submit a hazard report.
   Aircrews should consider using a Hazardous Air Traffic Report.
   4.4.5. Installation safety staffs send hazard reports that involve other military services,
   foreign nations or other agencies outside the Air Force to HQ AFSC/SE, 9700 G Ave SE,
   Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5670, and to the affected Air Force units and their chain of
   command as information addressees. Upon receipt, AFSC will maintain tracking and
   subsequent closing action of the report and will report results to both the sending and
   affected unit.
4.5. Employee Appeal Procedures. If an employee is dissatisfied with actions taken on a
hazard report, he or she should resubmit the report to the appropriate installation safety, fire
protection or Bioenvironmental Engineering office, and request the alleged hazard be
reinvestigated. Reports can be submitted anonymously. The safety, fire and/or health
representative must respond within 10 workdays.
   4.5.1. If the employee is still dissatisfied, they may appeal to a higher level of safety, fire
   protection or health office in the following sequence:
       4.5.1.1. Intermediate headquarters.
       4.5.1.2. MAJCOM headquarters.
 50                                                   AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013


       4.5.1.3. AFSC/SEG (safety hazards), AFCESA/CEXF (fire hazards), or AFMSA/SG3
       (health hazards).
       4.5.1.4. SAF/IE, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Installations, Environment and
       Logistics.
       4.5.1.5. Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environmental Security. This is the final
       review for reports that originate at installations in foreign countries, from military
       personnel or involve military-unique operations or equipment.
   4.5.2. Higher level of appeals must be addressed promptly and a reply sent to the employee
   within 20 calendar days. If a reply is not received within 20 calendar days or if the employee
   is dissatisfied with the reply, they may appeal to the next higher level. Each reply to an
   appeal will advise the employee of this right and will include the office symbol and address
   of the next higher level of appeal. If requested, the appropriate agency will assist the
   employee in obtaining technical information for clarification or for processing the appeal.
   4.5.3. Civilian employees may submit appeals directly to the Office of Federal Agency
   Safety Programs, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, US Department of Labor.
   However, the procedures outlined in the paragraphs above are encouraged as the most
   expeditious means of correcting hazardous conditions.
   4.5.4. The procedures outlined above do not prevent the use of agency or negotiated
   grievance procedures.
4.6. Risk Reduction and Mitigation. Commanders and supervisors at all levels are expected to
determine the level of acceptable risk required to preserve assets and safeguard health and
welfare. They should incorporate risk management into daily activities, on- and off-duty, IAW
AFI 90-901. These principles are:
   4.6.1. Accept no unnecessary risk.
   4.6.2. Make risk decisions at the appropriate level.
   4.6.3. Accept risk when benefits outweigh the cost.
   4.6.4. Integrate risk management into operations and planning at all levels.
AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013                                                            51


                                         Chapter 5

                        INFORMATION AND DATA ANALYSIS

5.1. Information Protection. Safety mishap reports have information in them that must be
protected under for official use only (FOUO), Privacy Act or Export Control Act. For FOUO
handling procedures, see AFI 91-204, Safety Investigation and Reports, and DoD Regulation
5200.1R, Information Security Program. Any release of safety mishap reports outside Air Force
safety channels must be coordinated with AFSC/JA prior to release. Refer to AFI 91-204 for
further information, possible exceptions and handling restrictions.
5.2. Safety Information.
   5.2.1. Forward reports of Air Force mishaps as directed by AFI 91-204. Some of these
   reports may have recommendations requiring urgent action by some addressees. Consider
   mishap reports to be action documents.
   5.2.2. Urgent action notices will be forwarded to HQ AFSC through the Air Force Service
   Watch Center (AFSWC) at DSN 227-6103 or AFWatch@Pentagon.af.mil. HQ AFSC will
   distribute these notices to safety offices through electronic distribution as appropriate to
   organizations with applicable guidance/instructions.
5.3. Recurring Publications. The goal of these publications is to prevent mishaps in operating
and maintaining aircraft and associated equipment and workplaces, storing and handling
explosives and weapons, conducting industrial operations, operating government and privately
owned vehicles, and participating in off-duty sports and recreation. These publications also
provide educational information on implementing applicable standards and in establishing and
maintaining nuclear surety and environmental safety programs. The OPR for each publication
will determine the content and frequency. HQ AFSC/SEF posts monthly Blue Four News on the
Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS) website, summarizing the previous month's Class
A flight mishaps. This summary contains privileged information and will be protected IAW AFI
91-204, Chapter 3.
   5.3.1. HQ AFSC/SE will issue recurring publications pertaining to the Air Force mishap
   prevention program.
   5.3.2. MAJCOM Publications. MAJCOMs will publish a safety magazine, newsletter or
   other media to disseminate command-specific safety information to subordinate units.
   MAJCOMs without published media may use an electronic website or Community of
   Practice to satisfy this requirement.
   5.3.3. Periodic Summaries. HQ/AFSC sends periodic mishap summaries to the MAJCOM
   safety staffs. These summaries include recent mishap experience, mishap statistics, analyses
   of current problem areas and proposed changes in safety policy. These summaries will be
   disseminated, as appropriate, to subordinate organizations for mishap prevention purposes.
5.4. Methods of Information Distribution. Select an appropriate distribution method by
considering content, time available and audience. The MAJCOM/SE will determine the
appropriate distribution methods for their subordinate organizations. Suggested methods of
distributing advisory information are:
 52                                                    AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013


   5.4.1. Safety meetings.
       5.4.1.1. (Added-AFSOC) Attendance at safety meetings will be documented.
   5.4.2. Supervisor safety briefings.
   5.4.3. Base newspapers and bulletins.
   5.4.4. Safety publications.
   5.4.5. HQ/AFSC or MAJCOM publications.
5.4.6. Electronically via e-mail, web page or video.
   5.4.7. (Added-AFSOC) Each wing/group/squadron will maintain a safety bulletin board
   located in common use or high traffic areas. This bulletin board will be used for posting of
   safety items only.
5.5. Mishap Analysis Program. In order to reduce mishaps, Commanders and Chiefs of Safety
must know the type and number of mishaps that occur in their command. Once the type and
number are identified, commanders can take risk mitigation actions based on sound statistical
data. This historical look-back approach should not preclude a proactive, forward looking mishap
prevention plan based on pre-identified hazards that haven’t yet caused a mishap.
   5.5.1. MAJCOMs and Wings will:
       5.5.1.1. Conduct a annual analysis and develop specific actions to reverse adverse trends.
       Analysis should target specific problem areas with recommendations for commander
       approval and appropriate actions.
       5.5.1.2. Analysis programs must identify successes or problem areas and trends, measure
       safety program effectiveness and guide prevention actions.
   5.5.2. HQ AFSC will perform Air Force level trend analysis and publish results. In addition,
   AFSC may conduct Safety Analysis Team (SAT) hazard and mishap trend analysis (as
   described in paragraph 5.8) for MAJCOMs, as directed by AF/SE.
5.6. Mishap Prevention Analysis Methods. There are several ways to approach analysis of
mishap data for mishap prevention purposes. Program analysis functions are to target, monitor
and/or study.
   5.6.1. Target Approach. This approach is similar to the study method below. After
   determining causes of mishaps, recommendations are developed and prioritized based on the
   frequency and severity. Corrective actions are directed at the activities and mechanisms that
   result in the greatest number of injuries.
   5.6.2. Monitor Approach. In this method, the safety staff selects categories of raw data and
   reviews them regularly in the form of tabulations or rates. The object is to identify trends and
   problem areas. Selection of the areas to be monitored depends on the available data and the
   needs of the organization. Mishap reports are a good place to start, but other areas should not
   be overlooked. Some other categories that may be appropriate for analysis are:
       5.6.2.1. Hazardous Air Traffic Reports.
       5.6.2.2. High Accident Potential Reports.
       5.6.2.3. Deficiency Reports.
AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013                                                             53


       5.6.2.4. Inspection/Evaluation Reports.
       5.6.2.5. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Reports.
       5.6.2.6. First-Aid Cases.
       5.6.2.7. Maintenance Logs or Reports.
       5.6.2.8. Hazard Reports.
   5.6.3. Study Approach. This is a detailed examination of a problem. A study should follow a
   systematic process. It typically follows the format of the Scientific Method. The researcher
   first drafts a problem statement that clearly defines the goals of the study. For example, a
   suitably specific research question might be “Determine a trend in the frequency of X and
   identify possible explanations for this trend.” The researcher will then conduct background
   research to identify factors and data relevant to the problem. Then the researcher must draft
   an objective statement that describes the problem and limits the study (the hypothesis or
   purpose). An example is “X is increasing because of Y.” Then the researcher develops a plan
   on how these factors and data are going to be collected, tabulated, compared, plotted and
   analyzed (methods). Finally, the data is collected and analyzed and results reported
   confirming or denying the hypotheses. Conclusions and implications regarding application of
   the results of the study are the most important outcome of the study.
5.7. Use of Analyzed Data. The purpose of analysis is to help prevent mishaps. Present
conclusions drawn in a useful format to the people who can use them directly in their prevention
programs. The data should also be available to other organizations with like equipment or
problems. After taking corrective actions, follow-up analysis may be done to measure the
effectiveness of these actions.
5.8. Safety Analysis Team (SAT) Process. The SAT process is a proactive, data-driven
process with the goal of providing commanders with unbiased, rank-ordered risk mitigation
strategies to assist in resource allocation for the preservation of combat capability.
   5.8.1. The SAT process focuses exclusively on Subject Matter Expert (SME) analysis of
   mishap reports, identification of “documented” risk and development of risk mitigation
   strategies to meet these hazards. The process then considers the effectiveness of each of the
   strategies weighed against real-world constraints, and through detailed mathematical analysis
   provides commanders with a rank-ordered list of qualified and quantified recommendations
   for implementation.
   5.8.2. SAT assessments can be requested through the AFSC Analysis and Integration
   Division (AFSC/SEA). All requests are approved by AF/SE. HQ AFSC/SEA will conduct
   the study and provide a final report and out-brief to the requesting commander. For
   additional information contact HQ AFSC/SEA; DSN: 246-1562, Commercial: (505) 846-
   1562.
5.9. Air Force Culture Assessment Safety Tool (AFCAST). AFCAST provides squadron
commanders and above with web-based tools to survey aircrew, maintenance and support
personnel regarding safety issues. AFCAST also offers ground safety versions for Drinking and
Driving, Private Motor Vehicle, Motorcycle, and Off-duty and Outdoor Recreational Activity.
   5.9.1. AFCAST helps commanders identify safety concerns and hazards while highlighting
   where to focus their hazard assessment efforts. This tool’s key goal is identification and
 54                                                  AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013


   correction of subtle organizational conditions that increase mishap potential. Commanders
   receive real-time feedback on attitudes and perceptions concerning safety climate and
   culture, resource availability, workload, progress of safety intervention programs and other
   operational factors relating to safety.
   5.9.2. Commanders can request AFCAST surveys by visiting www.afcast.org. Other
   inquiries must be addressed to the HQ AFSC Human Factors Division (HQ AFSC/SEH).
5.10. Organizational Safety Assessment (OSA). OSAs are a proactive, mishap prevention tool
that aids commanders and other leaders in risk assessment and decision making.
   5.10.1. The OSA program focuses on operations, maintenance, air traffic control, security
   forces and other areas directly related to safety. It assesses and quantifies personnel stress
   levels and perceptions. The OSA identifies organizational climate and culture factors with
   safety implications and provides base level senior leadership with proven safety
   recommendations tailored to specific situations.
   5.10.2. Installation-level commanders may request an OSA through the AFSC Human
   Factors Division (AFSC/SEH). All requests are approved by AF/SE. HQ AFSC will conduct
   the assessment and provide an out-brief to the requesting commander. Contact AFSC/SEHA
   DSN 246-3763 for information.
5.11. Standard Mishap Metrics. Mishap metrics (calculated as a number of events against
some kind of exposure) are an effective way to compare the actions and accomplishments of
your unit. Consideration must be given to the differences in operations, environment, equipment
or other variables when comparing organizations or MAJCOMs. The metrics used by the safety
community to this point have focused on results - the number of mishaps experienced over time
relative to exposure. HQ AFSC uses standardized rates for metrics below:
   5.11.1. Aviation Mishaps.
       5.11.1.1. Total USAF Aviation Class A/B Metric. This metric identifies the number of
       USAF aviation mishaps (to include flight, flight related aircraft ground operations and
       remotely piloted aircraft [RPA]) and aircraft flight and RPA mishap rates per 100,000
       flying hours. The Class A/B rate is calculated as the total number of Class A/B mishaps
       multiplied by 100,000 flying hours divided by the total number of flying hours.
       5.11.1.2. USAF Class A Aviation Flight Mishap Metric. This metric identifies the
       number of USAF Class A aircraft flight mishaps per 100,000 flying hours.
       5.11.1.3. Aviation-Related Fatalities Metric. This metric identifies the number of
       fatalities due to USAF aviation mishaps and mishap rates per 100,000 flying hours.
       5.11.1.4. Destroyed USAF Aircraft Metric. This metric identifies the number of
       destroyed USAF aircraft due to aviation mishaps and mishap rates per 100,000 flying
       hours.
       5.11.1.5. USAF RPA A/B Metric. This metric identifies the number of USAF RPA
       mishaps and the RPA mishap rate per 100,000 flying hours.
       5.11.1.6. USAF RPA Destroyed Metric. This metric identifies the number of USAF
       destroyed RPA and the rate per 100,000 flying hours.
AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013                                                               55


  5.11.2. Class A & B Missile and Explosives Metric. This metric identifies the total Class A
  and B missile and explosives mishaps.
  5.11.3. Class A & B Space Metric. This metric identifies the total Class A and B Space
  mishaps.
  5.11.4. Ground Mishaps.
     5.11.4.1. On-Duty Ground Metric (Rate). This metric applies to both military and
     civilian personnel and is used to identify the number of mishaps, fatalities or injuries
     experienced by military and civilian personnel while on-duty per 100,000 personnel per
     FY. To calculate daily, monthly or yearly on-duty rates, multiply the total number of
     military and civilian mishap, fatalities or injuries by 100,000 personnel divided by the
     military and civilian strength. NOTE: When calculating rates for periods of time less
     than one year, the reduced exposure time must be accounted for as provided in the
     monthly and daily examples below. NOTE: AFSC calculates daily and yearly statistics
     based upon AFPC strength numbers.
     5.11.4.2. Off-Duty Ground Metric (Rate). This metric applies only to military personnel
     and is used to identify the number of mishaps, fatalities or injuries experienced by off-
     duty military personnel per 100,000 personnel per year. To calculate daily, monthly or
     yearly off-duty rates, multiply the total number of military mishap, fatalities or injuries x
     100,000 personnel divided by the military strength (see examples in paragraph 5.11.4.1
     above except exclude civilian strength). NOTE: When calculating rates for periods of
     time less than one year, the reduced exposure time must be accounted for as provided as
     in the examples in paragraph 5.11.4.1 above. NOTE: AFSC calculates daily and yearly
     statistics based upon AFPC strength numbers.
     5.11.4.3. Private Motor Vehicle (PMV) Off-duty Fatality Metric (Rate). This metric
     applies only to military personnel and is used to identify the number of off-duty PMV
     mishaps, fatalities or injuries experienced by off-duty military personnel per 100,000
     personnel (see examples in paragraph 5.11.4.1 above except exclude civilian strength).
     NOTE: When calculating rates for periods of time less than one year, the reduced
     exposure time must be accounted for as provided as in the examples in paragraph
     5.11.4.1 above.
     5.11.4.4. Total Case Incident Rate (TCIR). This metric applies only to civilian personnel
     and is used to identify the total number of recordable (Class A, B, C, and D) civilian
     injuries and illness cases per 100 full-time employees that a site has experienced per year.
     Rationale: The 200,000 hours are based on 100 full-time workers working 40 hours per
     week, 50 weeks each year (100 x 40 hours per week x 50 weeks). Total man hours
     worked equals the personnel strength x 40 hours per week x 50 weeks per year plus
     overtime hours worked. NOTE: When calculating rates for periods of time less than one
     year, the reduced exposure time must be accounted for as provided in the examples in
     paragraph 5.11.4.1 excluding military strength. NOTE: Actual hours to include overtime
     should be used for computing civilian hours worked.
     5.11.4.5. Days Away, Restricted, and/or Transfer (DART) Case Incidence Rate. This
     metric applies only to civilian personnel and is used to identify the total number of
     recordable civilian injuries and illness cases per 100 full-time employees resulting in days
 56                                                   AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013


       away from work, restricted work activity, and/or job transfer that a site has experienced
       in a given time frame. Rationale: The 200,000 hours are based on 100 full-time workers
       working 40 hours per week, 50 weeks each year (100 x 40 hours per week x 50 weeks).
       Total man hours worked equals the personnel strength x 40 hours per week x 50 weeks
       per year plus overtime hours worked. NOTE: When calculating rates for periods of time
       less than one year, the reduced exposure time must be accounted for as provided in the
       examples in para 5.11.4.1.excluding military strength NOTE: Actual hours to include
       overtime should be used for computing civilian hours worked.
       5.11.4.6. To compare your TCIR and DART rates go to the Bureau of Labor Statistics
       (BLS) website at http://www.osha.gov/oshstats/work.html for national averages.
5.12. Calculating Federal Employee Compensation Metric (Rate). This metric applies only
to civilian personnel. These rates are related to civilian claims that result for on-duty civilian
mishaps per 200,000 hours of exposure. To calculate the rates, multiply the number of civilian
compensation claims by 200,000 hours divided by civilian strength multiplied by 2,000 hours
plus overtime hours. Rationale: The 2,000 hours equates to 40 hours per week x 50 weeks per
year. NOTE: When calculating rates for periods of time less than one year, the reduced
exposure time must be accounted for as provided in the examples in paragraph 5.11.4.1
excluding military strength.

                                           Chapter 6

                     DEPLOYMENT AND CONTINGENCY SAFETY

6.1. Deployment and Contingency Safety Program. The purpose of this chapter is to provide
Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) a tool to preserve combat capability and manage
risk to U.S. based and deployed Air Force units supporting U.S. homeland and worldwide
contingency operations. The rotational nature of forces within an Area of Responsibility (AOR)
necessitates an active program and commander involvement at all levels. Pre-planning, training,
and preparation prior to deployments are essential to mission success. See AFPAM 91-216,
USAF Safety Deployment and Contingency. NOTE: The Safety Supplement of the War
Mobilization Plan is a tool available to further assist the safety community and commanders with
helping to determine which programs that could be reduced or suspended at home station or as
forces are deployed and reduced manpower affects the ability of forces to execute home station
responsibilities.
   6.1.1. Objectives.
       6.1.1.1. Provide timely and accurate safety information to commanders.
       6.1.1.2. Enhance deployed unit mishap prevention programs.
       6.1.1.3. Identify unit hazards to Air Force Forces Command (AFFOR). This includes
       only command Master Hazard Abatement items (RACs 1 -3), not RAC 4 and 5 hazards.
       6.1.1.4. Recommend required mishap mitigation measures.
   6.1.2. No aspect of this chapter is intended to conflict with existing AFPDs, AFIs or Tactics,
   Techniques, and Procedures (TTP). It is intended to clarify the duties and responsibilities of
   the deployed Air Force Safety office and assigned personnel in the context of a unique
   deployment environment. In the event that this instruction conflicts with safety guidelines set
   forth by AOR governing/executive agency, the most restrictive guidance will apply. The
   requirements of the Deployed and Contingency Safety Program apply to all AFFOR
   assigned/gained/aligned units for the duration of their assignment or deployment. In specific
   areas where guidance is lacking in this instruction, good judgment and thorough
   communication throughout the chain of command must prevail.
   6.1.3. Bare Base Safety.
       6.1.3.1. Risk Management. While establishing bare base and short term operations, the
       single most important action a deployed Chief of Safety can take is time-critical Risk
       Management. Specific programs as listed in this instruction will be implemented as
       resources are available to establish and maintain them. Once in place, sustainment ops
       commanders, supervisors and functional managers at all levels will develop and
       implement safety, risk management and health programs that integrate hazard reduction
       and safety policy into all on-duty and off-duty operations and activities.
       6.1.3.2. Key Programs. Bare base safety priorities must include a Spot Inspection
       Program (ensures safety is in the work areas), the Unit Safety Representative program
       (conduit for information to and from the unit), and Mishap Response Plans. As the
       location matures, the commander must evaluate the need for additional programs.

     end of tour comments to the deployed COS. All deployed COSs will consolidate inputs
     from each safety discipline and will submit a written report to AFFOR/SE before the
     completion of their deployment and maintain a copy in their continuity book. This report
     should focus on lessons learned, positive and negative. Activities, actions and duties
     performed while deployed may be included but the primary focus of the report is to
     improve the Deployed Safety Program. These reports will be forwarded or made
     available to other organizations (e.g. AFSC, MAJCOMs, NAFs and wings), as
     appropriate.
     6.3.3.10. Weapons Safety.
        6.3.3.10.1. Explosives Site Planning. Site Planning will be accomplished IAW

        6.3.3.11.4. Reviewing project designs and plans for projects and construction.
        Coordinate with SEW on projects.
     6.3.3.12. Space Safety. For operationally deployed space assets, system-related safety
     issues will directed through Wing Safety (or equivalent), NAF/Center Safety, MAJCOM
     Safety and HQ AFSC/SES. Wing or equivalent-level safety offices responsible for
     deployed assets are responsible for the following:
        6.3.3.12.1. Directed Energy Systems. Ensure all directed energy systems are directed
        away from aircraft traffic patterns and personnel. Ensure coordination with local air
        traffic control to avoid development of flight patterns that may impinge upon DE
        clear zones. Directed energy systems aimed above the horizon must interface with the
        Laser Clearinghouse (per DoDI O-3100.11, Illumination of Objects in Space by
        Lasers).
        6.3.3.12.2. Frequency Management. Deploying units contact MAJCOM and AFFOR
        frequency managers prior to their arrival at the operating location to de-conflict
        potential interference issues. Upon arrival, contact the local frequency manager to
        follow up on any changes which may have occurred while en route. Ensure
        compliance with the published Joint Restricted Frequency List (JRFL).

6.4. Mishap Prevention Program. AFFOR deployed safety offices should establish and
maintain all required mishap prevention programs as addressed in this instruction and applicable
AOR procedures. AFFOR/SE will provide guidance and assistance as necessary.
   6.4.1. Mishap Investigation. In general, COMAFFOR is not the convening authority for
   mishaps in the AOR. Convening authority falls to the home station MAJCOM IAW AFI 91-
   204. The convening authority may contact the COMAFFOR and/or AFFOR/SE to request
   local deployed safety office SIB support beyond ISB responsibilities, provided the deployed
   commander and AFFOR/SE supports the request. Mishap Investigations should be
   accomplished IAW AFI 91-204 with the following caveats:
       6.4.1.1. Aviation. The COMAFFOR is the convening authority for all Class E BASH,
       HATR, Controlled Movement Area Violations (CMAV) and some High Accident
       Potential (HAP) (when cause is dependent on the deployed environment and not the
       object) incidents. When objects are owned by the AFFOR (some small remotely piloted
       aircraft, etc.), COMAFFOR will maintain convening authority. These caveats are not
       applicable to U.S. based AFFOR assigned/gained units supporting AFFOR AOR mission
       requirements:

                                      AVIATION SAFETY

7.1. Program Management. Each unit conducting or supporting flight operations must have an
aviation safety program. The COS or senior installation safety representative will ensure an
active safety presence at the installation through the plans, programs and training responsibilities
outlined below.
   7.1.1. The host safety office is responsible for the base aviation safety program.
   7.1.2. Tenant units coordinate their flight safety programs with the host to avoid duplication.
   If the host does not have a FSO authorization, the largest tenant with an authorization
   manages the base flight safety program. If neither the host nor the tenant has a FSO
   authorization, flight safety responsibilities revert to the host COS.
7.2. Plans. The FSO/FSM/ FSNCO will help develop and review appropriate emergency
response plans and coordinate on any other installation plans involving flight safety or aircraft
emergencies. These plans should include but are not limited to:
   7.2.1. Aircraft Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP). The COS is
   responsible for ensuring that units develop an aviation specific portion of the CEMP. The
   COS ensures the plan defines roles, responsibilities and notification requirements for
   leadership and all involved agencies. The CEMP should include elements of or a reference to
   existing plans concerning the disaster response required by AFI 10-2501, Air Force
   Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations.
   7.2.2. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Plan. The host flight safety office will
   establish the BASH plan, to include, defining the nature and extent of wildlife hazards and
   implementation of the plan. Plan implementation may require environmental controls and
   changes to bird/wildlife dispersal/removal techniques and operational procedures.
   Cooperative agreements for managing fish and wildlife resources require coordination with
   state and Federal conservation agencies prior to implementation. IAW AFI 32-7064,
   paragraph 14.1, the Integrated Natural Resource Management Plan must support the
   installation’s BASH plan. The BASH plan must identify local procedures and permits for the
   proper collection, handling and disposal of wildlife carcasses and biological material
   discovered on the airfield and aircraft.
7.3. Programs. The COS will ensure the following programs are established, maintained and
reviewed at least annually.
   7.3.1. BASH Program. Responsibilities for establishing and administering the Air Force
   BASH Program:
       7.3.1.1. HQ AFSC/SEFW will:
           7.3.1.1.1. Analyze wildlife strike data to provide baseline information to Air Force
           agencies.
           7.3.1.1.2. Approve the exchange and distribution of Air Force wildlife strike data to
           US Government and foreign agencies.
AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013                                                             67


        7.3.1.1.3. Monitor MAJCOM BASH reduction programs.
        7.3.1.1.4. Instruct FSOs/FSMs/FSNCOs in BASH reduction and provide basic
        BASH training at AETC-sponsored training programs (i.e., FSNCO Safety Course,
        Airfield Management Course, etc.).
        7.3.1.1.5. Propose BASH reduction policies and guidelines to AFSC/SE.
        7.3.1.1.6. Review proposed conservation projects and Federal legislation affecting
        the Air Force’s BASH reduction program and coordinate the Air Force response with
        AFSC/SE and other agencies.
        7.3.1.1.7. Identify and develop programs to aid in evaluating potential bird strike
        hazards in low-level airspace.
        7.3.1.1.8. At installation request, coordinated through the respective MAJCOM,
        provide technical assistance to reduce wildlife hazards at bases with flying operations.
        7.3.1.1.9. At installation request, coordinated through the respective MAJCOM,
        provide technical assistance in evaluating installation BASH plans.
        7.3.1.1.10. Coordinate Air Force BASH program with other Federal agencies.
        7.3.1.1.11. Identify Air Force BASH research requirements, developing and
        managing research projects.

        private organizations regarding wildlife hazard reduction.
        7.3.1.1.13. Administer Air Force’s wildlife hazard advisory systems and bird
        feather/wildlife strike remains identification program.
        7.3.1.1.14. Provide technical assistance to Safety Investigation Board president when
        a wildlife hazard may be a factor in a mishap.
        7.3.1.1.15. Chair the Air Force BASH Steering Group meetings, as needed.
     7.3.1.2. Air Education Training Command (AETC) will:
        7.3.1.2.1. Incorporate wildlife aircraft strike hazard reduction training into AETC-
        sponsored formal training courses used to educate base pest management specialists,
        safety technicians and airfield managers in wildlife aircraft strike hazard reduction.
        7.3.1.2.2. Incorporate safety awareness of wildlife aircraft strike hazards into safety
        briefings provided at joint undergraduate navigator training, joint specialized
        undergraduate pilot training (JSUPT), and pilot instructor training (PIT) programs.
     7.3.1.3. MAJCOMs will:
        7.3.1.3.1. Ensure each installation conducting or supporting flight operations has an
        annually reviewed written BASH plan. Ensure all tenant units are included in the base
        BASH plan.
        7.3.1.3.2. Conduct on-site reviews of installation BASH programs, to include
        potential hazards and mitigation techniques, at least every 36 months. Coordinate as
        needed with HQ AFSC/SEFW. Tenant unit BASH programs will be reviewed by
68                                                 AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013


        owning MAJCOMS and may be scheduled during reoccurring inspections or staff
        assistance visits.
        7.3.1.3.3. Consider potential wildlife strike hazards when developing or revising
        operational procedures, training routes, ranges, instrument approach and departure
        procedures, establishing Memorandums of Agreement (MOA) or low altitude tactical
        navigation areas.
     7.3.1.4. Wing, Base and Installation Safety Offices are responsible for the following:
        7.3.1.4.1. Base Level BASH Program. Host Air Force, AFRC or ANG installations
        with flying operations will establish a BASH program. The BASH program will
        include all tenant-flying units. The BASH program requires complete documentation
        of local wildlife hazards, effects on missions and possible solutions to include hazards
        surrounding ranges used by local flying units. Tenant units located on an airfield that
        is not hosted by the Air Force, AFRC or ANG will establish a BASH program with
        host authority (civilian airport, Naval Air Station, Federal airfield, etc.). The BASH
        program will document coordination with the host authority on reducing wildlife
        hazards.
        7.3.1.4.2. Review the BASH plan annually for accuracy and compliance with current
        directives, revising as necessary. Ensure all tenant units are included in the base
        BASH plan.
        7.3.1.4.3. BASH programs at overseas locations depend on host nation support and
        regulations. MAJCOMs will evaluate those plans to ensure the spirit of this
        instruction is complied with to the maximum extent possible.
        7.3.1.4.4. Each installation with flying operations must develop a contingency plan
        that lists responsibilities and procedures for wildlife control. Due to the complexities
        of hazard abatement and potential for loss of aircraft and crew, it is strongly
        recommended that a dedicated wildlife hazard management specialist be retained on
        staff.
        7.3.1.4.5. Establish a Bird Hazard Working Group (BHWG) consisting of
        organizations involved in airfield wildlife control, habitat management, operations
        and safety. The BHWG must meet at least semi-annually with minutes maintained.
        The vice installation commander or equivalent will chair the meeting. The BHWG
        will coordinate base improvement projects, e.g., base beautification, wastewater
        treatment, golf courses, etc., for BASH-related issues.
        7.3.1.4.6. Develop a Bird Hazard Warning System to inform aircrews of possible
        flight hazards due to wildlife activity in local areas. Bird Watch Condition (BWC)
        codes will be used to communicate local wildlife activity along with location, number
        and type of wildlife. Installation BASH plans will specify aircrew notification
        procedures for BWC changes. The most expeditious means of communicating the
        status change should be used (e.g. ATC or SOF radio transmissions combined with
        ATIS updates or other broadcast medium). BWC codes are defined as:
            7.3.1.4.6.1. SEVERE. Wildlife activity on or immediately above the active
            runway or other specific location representing high potential for strikes.
AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013                                                              69


              Supervision and aircrews must thoroughly evaluate mission need before
              conducting operations in areas under condition SEVERE.
              7.3.1.4.6.2. MODERATE. Wildlife activity near the active runway or other
              specific location representing increased potential for strikes. BWC MODERATE
              requires increased vigilance by all agencies and supervisors and caution by
              aircrews.
              7.3.1.4.6.3. LOW. Wildlife activity on and around the airfield representing low
              potential for strikes.
NOTE: BWC codes are based on observations of local airfield wildlife activity and are
independent of BAM or Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) risk hazard levels.
NOTE: BWC SEVERE or MODERATE requires action from the installation’s wildlife
dispersal team to reduce the BWC to LOW as soon as possible.
          7.3.1.4.7. Designate Phase I and Phase II periods of wildlife activity based on
          historical wildlife activity information. Phase II represents times of significant
          increases in local wildlife activity, normally associated with migratory movements,
          seasonal increases of local wildlife populations, or local land use practices (farming,
          ranching, or hunting). Establish flight and scheduling procedures to minimize risks
          based on local hazards associated with Phase I and II. Publish Phase I and II
          designations in the appropriate DoD Flight Information Publications. Critical updates
          may be made using Notice to Airman System.
          7.3.1.4.8. Regardless of Phase designation, the highest levels of daily wildlife
          activity normally occur +/- one hour of sunrise/sunset as birds move to and from their
          roosts. Flight operations should be avoided during these periods unless mission
          essential. A risk analysis shall be completed to determine the potential risk to
          operations during these periods. Appropriate measures should be taken to mitigate the
          risk if required. Maintain a zero tolerance toward large free-roaming animals on or
          adjacent to the aircraft movement area (free-roaming animals are, but not limited to,
          deer, canines, geese, etc).
          7.3.1.4.9. Grass Height. Mow aircraft movement area (AMA) to maintain a grass
          height between 7 and 14 inches. The AMA, as defined in UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and
          Heliport Planning and Design, is that area of the airfield encompassed by the Primary
          Surface and the Clear Zones, as well as apron areas and taxiways, regardless of their
          location. As a minimum, turf shall be maintained 500 feet outside the AMA boundary
          where able. Installations located in arid climates where growing grass is difficult may
          develop natural vegetation on the airfield to limit attractiveness to wildlife. These
          situations require comprehensive vegetation/wildlife hazard management and will be
          reviewed individually by HQ AFSC/SEFW for approval. Installation safety offices
          may request a grass height restriction waiver from HQ AFSC/SEFW after MAJCOM
          coordination.
          7.3.1.4.10. Technical Assistance. Technical assistance is available through the USAF
          BASH Team, HQ AFSC/SEFW, 9700 G Avenue, Suite 266, Kirtland AFB, NM
          87117-5670. DSN: 246-5674/5679/5673/1440 or Commercial: (505) 846-xxxx, and
          electronically by accessing the Safety Center web page. Obtain additional information

         on wildlife strike hazard reduction from AFPAM 91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike
         Hazard (BASH) Management Techniques, and on wildlife strike reporting from AFI
         91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, and AFMAN 91-223, Aviation Safety
         Investigations and Reports.
  7.3.2. Hazardous Air Traffic Reporting (HATR) and High Accident Potential (HAP)
  programs. The FSO/FSM investigates HATRs and HAPs according to AFI 91-204 and
  ensures HATR and HAP reporting procedures and requirements are briefed at least annually
  to aircrew and ATC personnel (see Attachment 3 of this AFI and AFMAN 91-223 for
  reporting requirements).
  7.3.3. Midair Collision Avoidance (MACA) Program. Units with flying programs must
  establish a written MACA program. The unit safety office is responsible for its creation,
  documentation and upkeep. The FSO/FSM works closely with the MAJCOM-determined
  OPR and other interested parties such as the Airfield Operations Flight Commander
  (AOF/CC), the airspace manager, local Fixed Base Operators (FBOs), Aircraft Owners and
  Pilots Association (AOPA), and the local Flight Standards District Officer (FSDO), to
  establish a comprehensive MACA program. Use the resources and services of the FAA
  FSDO accident prevention specialists. Tailor the MACA program to meet local needs. As a
  minimum, the FSO/FSM will coordinate with appropriate agencies to accomplish these key
  objectives:
  7.3.3. (AFSOC) Midair Collision Avoidance (MACA) Program. Tenant unit FSOs will
  actively participate in host base MACA program. If a host base program does not exist or
  does not meet unit needs, tenant units will establish their own MACA program.
     7.3.3.1. Ensure the free flow of MACA information between host and tenant
     organizations, effective communication between base and local airport managers and
     fixed base operators (FBOs), and actively support the HATR Program.
     7.3.3.2. Establish procedures to control VFR aircraft and minimize the air-traffic
     hazards.
     7.3.3.3. Deconflict MTRs as much as possible and acquaint the flying public with the
     location, configuration, speeds, and altitudes of the base MTR and military operating
     areas through military and FAA personnel.
     7.3.3.4. Ensure that arrival and departure routes (including stereo routes and profile
     descents) minimize conflicts with runway traffic, nearby airfields, and local flying areas.
     7.3.3.5. Evaluate the midair collision potential with civil airlines and work with
     operators of nearby airfields to reduce risk and minimize the hazards.
     7.3.3.6. Develop a MACA pamphlet. Overseas locations should consider publishing the
     pamphlet in the host country’s language along with English. Provide educational
     programs/publications to general aviation servicing facilities to increase the use of
     available radar services among civil aircraft. Develop appropriate maps and graphics
     showing the base radar services and routes. Distribute the maps to all civil airfield
     managers, fixed base operators, military base operations, airports and other flying
     operations that use the surrounding airspace.
AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013                                                                71


       7.3.3.7. Units may combine MACA programs with other military organizations in a 50-
       mile range of their base. This will require more coordination efforts but will result in a
       better product to be used by the area’s civilian population.
       7.3.3.8. Units and MAJCOMs are encouraged to participate in the DoD-endorsed and
       funded www.SEEandAVOID.org (MACA website).
   7.3.4. Awards Program. Ensure proper recognition of personnel through the Air Force Safety
   Awards Program as outlined in AFI 36-2833, Safety Awards.
   7.3.5. Operational/Training Squadron Flight Safety Program. The squadron commander will
   maintain overall supervision of the flight safety program. The Squadron Assigned Flight
   Safety Officer (SAFSO) represents an extension of the wing flight safety program at the
   squadron level. In addition to managing the squadron flight safety program, these individuals
   are still responsible for carrying out all normal wing safety duties as requested by Wing COS.
   Units possessing aircraft with enlisted crew positions should also consider appointing an
   enlisted crewmember as additional duty flight safety NCO to assist in the flight safety
   program.
       7.3.5.1. The squadron commander will ensure that the following actions are
       accomplished by the SAFSOs:
           7.3.5.1.1. Upon appointment, contact the wing safety office for required training.
           7.3.5.1.2. Administer the unit safety program using this instruction as a guide and
           management tool.
           7.3.5.1.3. Disseminate flight safety information to unit crewmembers.
           7.3.5.1.4. Forward all flying safety matters of significance, which cannot be
           corrected at unit level through the unit commander to the COS.
           7.3.5.1.5. Assist in conducting wing safety inspections as requested and conduct unit
           self-inspections.
           7.3.5.1.6. Ensure a current file of applicable safety directives, to include this
           instruction, AFI 91-204, AFP 91-212 and AFI 36-2833 are maintained by the unit.
           7.3.5.1.7. Maintain Volume V of the squadron Flight Crew Information File (FCIF)
           IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program.
           Procedures will be implemented to ensure all aircrews review Volume V.
           7.3.5.1.8. Maintain unit safety bulletin boards.
7.4. Aero Club Operations. The host unit commander appoints an FSO as a safety advisor to
the base Aero Club. If the host unit does not have an assigned FSO, the commander will obtain
the assistance of a tenant unit FSO to provide safety assistance to the Aero Club. The host safety
office may investigate Aero Club mishaps IAW AFI 91-204. However, the National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) or host nation civil aviation authority has primary
responsibility for investigating and reporting. Refer to AFI 34-217, Air Force Aero Club
Program, for further guidance on Aero Club support. The wing safety advisor should attend the
monthly aero club safety meetings.
7.5. Training Meetings and Briefings. The COS will ensure the following:
72                                                 AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013

   Hazard, and AF Form 3.
   8.6.6. Fire Hazards versus Fire Deficiencies. There is a difference between fire hazards and
   fire deficiencies. A fire hazard is a condition that can cause a fire to occur. A fire deficiency
   is a condition which reduces fire safety below acceptable levels, including noncompliance
   with standards, but by itself cannot cause a fire to occur.
   8.6.7. Fire hazards are included in the master hazard abatement plan and fire deficiencies are
   excluded from the master hazard abatement plan.
8.7. Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) Guidance. AFOSH guidance is
the minimum guidance necessary to provide a safe and healthful work environment for all Air
Force personnel and other DoD/government employees working on Air Force installations.
AFOSH requirements shall provide equal or greater protection than federal requirements. The
Air Force may develop supplementary or alternative guidance where inadequate or no guidance
exists. NOTE: Conflicts between OSHA and AFOSH guidelines shall be referred to HQ AFSC
through the appropriate MAJCOM for resolution.
   8.7.1. Occupational safety and health guidance sources include:
      8.7.1.1. Regulatory Federal Standards. The Air Force complies with the intent of DoL
      OSHA Standards, Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation
      Standards by referencing applicable standards or incorporates the requirements into
      AFOSH guidance, technical orders or directives.
      8.7.1.2. AFOSH Standards and Guidance. Air Force published guidance located at
      http://www.e-publishing.af.mil.
      8.7.1.3. T.O.s and manufacturers’ guidance (e.g., Material Safety Data Sheets [MSDS])
      for specific processes, aircraft and equipment.
      8.7.1.4. Reference library maintained by the installation ground safety manager to
      include national consensus standards and other technical and safety guidance.
   8.7.2. Joint-Use Workplaces. Personnel from different DoD Components or other Federal
   Agencies working in the same workplace shall be governed by OSHA standards and any
   applicable alternate standards or host-agency standards, such as AFOSH Standards.
80                                                   AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013


  8.7.3. Military-Unique Situations. OSHA standards do not apply to military-unique
  workplaces, operations, equipment and systems. However, Air Force policy is that OSHA
  standards shall apply as much as possible, practicable and consistent with military
  requirements, unless HQ AFSC approves an exemption or variance.
  8.7.4. Variances and Exemptions. The affected work center shall process a request for
  variance when it is impractical or impossible to meet OSHA Standards or AFOSH guidance
  due to operational needs, mission impact or technical reasons. Variances are temporary and
  are normally granted for periods not to exceed five years. Exemptions grant permanent relief
  from a requirement and can be approved when the applicant can substantiate that their
  proposed methods, equipment or facilities protect the worker as well or better than the
  AFOSH or OSHA Standards. AFSC may grant exemptions or variances to AFOSH
  Standards and guidance that are more stringent than OSHA requirements. AFSC does not
  have the authority to grant a waiver or exemption to an OSHA Standard. Only OSHA can
  grant waivers or exemptions to Title 29 (OSHA) requirements (even if included in AFOSH
  Standards). However, for safety related issues, AFSC will serve as the liaison between
  OSHA and the Air Force requestor. NOTE: A unit’s inability to fund corrective actions does
  not constitute sufficient justification to request a variance. Request extensions for variances
  through MAJCOMs to HQ AFSC/SEG.
     8.7.4.1. Variance/Exemption Process.
         8.7.4.1.1. Affected work center personnel shall implement interim control measures
         and notify the installation ground safety, fire or health officials to validate the
         effectiveness of interim controls. With effective controls in place, the work center
         will coordinate the variance/exemption package with installation ground safety, fire
         and health officials.
         8.7.4.1.2. The installation safety office will assemble a detailed staff package that
         identifies the request, rational why the standard cannot be followed, interim control
         measures, drawing, maps, etc. (see paragraph 8.7.4.2), and forwards the request to
         MAJCOM headquarters through appropriate command safety, fire or health channels.
         8.7.4.1.3. The MAJCOM safety staff reviews and, if recommended for approval,
         forwards requests to AFSC/SEG (safety-related issues), AFCESA/CC (fire
         prevention-related issues) or AFMOA/SGO (health-related issues), as appropriate, for
         final approval. NOTE: Requests received without MAJCOM coordination will be
         returned to requestor without action.
         8.7.4.1.4. The MAJCOM/installation ground safety manager maintains a master file
         of approved variances or exemptions that apply to the installation/MAJCOM/AF as
         long as they are in effect and for one year thereafter. The safety manager distributes
         copies of variances and exemptions to fire protection, health and functional managers,
         as needed.
         8.7.4.1.5. Functional managers must train affected employees and employee
         representatives on approved variances, exemptions or any special procedures required
         and document training. Post copies in affected work areas until integrated into the
         JST guide.
     8.7.4.2. Written variance or exemption requests must contain:
AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013                                                               81

   Community Right To Know Act; secure explosives holding areas IAW the Defense Travel
   Regulation, Part II, Chapter 25, etc.), or accidental release risk management programs for
   explosives.
9.6. Missile Safety. Missile systems are ground-launched or air-launched and do not include
unpiloted drones or remotely piloted vehicles. The aerospace vehicle, ground support and
operational equipment, personnel, and the operational environment are all sources of mishaps.
Typically, missile launch operations will be conducted from a Major Range Test Facility Base
(MRTFB) range and will comply with DoDD 3200.11, Major Range and Test Facility Base
(MRTFB), in addition to AFI 99-103, Capabilities-Based Test and Evaluation, and AFI 13-212,
Range Planning and Operations, safety requirements as described in Chapters 1 and 2 of this
instruction.

   9.8.3. All directed energy systems that could be aimed above the horizon which could pose a
   potential threat to satellites or people in space will follow the procedures in DoDI 3100.11.
9.9. Munitions Rapid Response Team. Hill AFB’s Munitions Rapid Response Team (MRRT)
is manned with personnel knowledgeable in conventional munitions areas. This team is available
to support MAJCOMs and units whenever they have a conventional weapons mishap or problem.
They can be activated to respond within 24 to 48 hours. See Attachment 4 for specific guidance.
9.10. Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board (DDESB). The DDESB is a joint
board of the DoD. It is subject to the direction, authority and control of the Secretary of Defense,
under the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Environmental Security).
   9.10.1. The board consists of a chairperson and an officer (O-6/GS-15 or above) from each
   of the military departments. In addition, each military department must designate an
   alternate. Within the Air Force, AF/SE provides the primary and alternate members.
   9.10.2. The DDESB establishes DoD explosives safety policy and is responsible for the DoD
   Explosives Safety Management Program (ESMP). DDESB conducts Component-level
   programmatic evaluations according to DoDI 6055.16, Explosives Safety Management
   Program, which requires the Secretaries of the Military Departments to establish, resource,
   implement and maintain effective DoD Component-level ESMPs. Each year DDESB
   evaluates one of the Military Departments ESMPs. This is a top to bottom review (HAF,
   MAJCOM, NAF and installation) of the services’ explosives safety program.
9.11. Weapons Safety Training. The MAJCOM weapons safety office must provide
MAJCOM-unique Weapons Safety Manager (WSM) training to their installation, Center and
NAF weapons safety personnel. MAJCOMs must ensure all weapons safety personnel in their
command are properly trained.
   9.11.1. The installation weapons safety manager provides weapons safety training to all
   appointed Additional Duty Weapons Safety Representatives (ADWSR) on their
   responsibilities and program management. ADWSMs are required to be trained within 30
   days of appointment, with recurring training as determined by the MAJCOM. Installation
   weapons safety managers will also evaluate and monitor unit weapons safety training,
   approve lesson plans and review annually.
   9.11.2. The base or unit weapons safety manager or designated representative conducts this
   training, which augments the job training provided by the supervisor. The weapons safety
   staff evaluates and monitors unit weapons safety, approves lesson plans and reviews them
   annually. All personnel (supervisory and non-supervisory) who operate, handle, transport,
   maintain, load, or dispose of missiles, explosives, or nuclear weapons, must receive initial
   weapons safety training before performing any of these tasks. Recurring training must be
   provided not later than the end of the 15th month following initial training. EXCEPTION:
   People who store and/or handle only the following are exempt from initial and refresher

                                        SPACE SAFETY

10.1. Program Management. All units conducting space-related missions must have a
comprehensive space safety program. Reference AFI 91-217, Space Safety and Mishap
Prevention Program, for specific space safety program requirements. Reference AFMAN 91-
222, Space Safety Investigation and Reports, for specific investigative reporting guidance.
10.2. Program Overview. All DoD activities with the potential to inadvertently and/or
adversely affect spacecraft or humans in space shall be conducted in a safe and reasonable
manner that protects space systems, their mission effectiveness, and humans in space, consistent
with national security requirements IAW DoDD 3100.10, Space Policy.
10.3. Space Control Systems. Space Control Systems, which include systems such as the
Space Surveillance Network, Command and Control Warning, and Offensive and Defensive
Counter Space Systems, have unique missions that don’t directly support other space systems.
All organizations that test or operate space control systems will have a space safety program.
10.4. Design, Development, Integration and Testing. Space systems will be designed, tested
and operated in such a manner to:
   10.4.1. In order to prevent design and operational problems, it is critical that space safety
   personnel (e.g. system safety managers) are included throughout all phases of a system’s
   lifetime.
   10.4.2. Local System Safety Managers must be included at all milestone decision points to
   effectively manage the risks in each program.
10.5. Launch, Range and Reentry Safety. The launch safety program covers activities
associated with the ground handling, launching and pre-orbital operations of space systems. It
also includes activities connected with the deployment, operation, reentry and recovery (if
required) of test vehicles or payloads that do not attain orbit (either planned or unplanned).
NOTE: Weapon safety programs cover intercontinental ballistic missile test launches.
10.6. Orbital Safety. The high cost of orbital assets, their unique operational design and the
irrecoverable nature of orbital hardware makes mishap prevention a critical component of orbital
systems, from the initial design phase through end-of-life activities. The orbital safety program
covers all activities associated with the development, testing and operation of space vehicles in
orbit or deep space, to include spacecraft design, orbital operations, reentry, recovery and
disposal elements.
10.7. Space Safety Council (SSC). The SSC will assist the AF/SE in fulfilling oversight
responsibilities through effective governance and management. This council, chaired by HQ
AFSC/SES, is composed of the MAJCOM/SEs or their representatives. Other military/civil
space agencies are invited to participate in the cross-flow of information. The council will hold at
least one annual meeting. The SSC shall:
   10.7.1. Recommend DoD/federal and commercial space safety policy, prepare and monitor
   DoD/federal and commercial space safety directives or instructions concerning safety issues.
   10.7.2. Promote space safety initiatives for both DoD/federal and commercial space flight.

   10.7.3. Maximize collaboration with organizational Safety Offices.
   10.7.4. Discuss space safety related System Safety issues.
   10.7.5. Provide for an independent assessment of overall program safety.
10.8. Space Safety Training. Assigned space safety personnel should be trained in all
applicable aspects of space safety according to the unit’s operations. This includes risk analysis
and management, System Safety, space environment hazards, testing, and conjunction
assessment. Space safety personnel should be trained in mission specific safety tasks: design,
range systems and operations, launch systems and operations (including conjunction on launch
assessment, and upper stage disposal), orbital systems and operations (including debris
minimization, conjunction assessment, collision avoidance, and end-of-life actions), and ground-
based space systems and operations (including space control and directed energy
systems/operations).
10.9. Space Nuclear Safety. Space nuclear safety falls under the Inter-agency Nuclear Safety
Review Panel, of which HQ AFSC/SES is the DoD representative. This program ensures that
radioactive sources and nuclear power systems used in space are designed, developed, built,
maintained, stored, handled, launched and used (including final disposition) with the maximum
safety and security consistent with operational requirements. Consult AFI 91-110, Nuclear Safety
Review and Launch Approval for Space or Missile Use of Radioactive Material and Nuclear
Systems, for nuclear safety review and launch approval requirements and procedures for the use
of nuclear powered system and radioactive sources in space.
10.10. Space Asset Interaction with Directed Energy Systems. There are many DoD
programs and/or experiments using the electromagnetic spectrum to produce high-energy lasers,
jammers and other ground-based or space-based devices. All DoD programs shall take
appropriate action or institute operational procedures to minimize hazards and/or interference
with spacecraft, the general public, property on the Earth’s surface, the Earth’s atmosphere and
the space environment.
   10.10.1. In addition to the requirements of paragraph 9.8, all laser systems that could be
   aimed above the horizon which could pose a potential threat to satellites or people in space
   will follow the procedures in DoDI O-3100.11, Illumination of Objects in Space by Lasers.
   10.10.2. Reference DoDI O-3100.11 and AFI 91-401 for further directed energy safety
   guidance.

                                           Chapter 11

                                      SYSTEM SAFETY

11.1. Overview. This Chapter establishes the roles, responsibilities and policy requirements for
Safety personnel in support of System Safety. It also defines how Safety personnel and
organizations interact, influence and advise the other Air Force communities that are corporately
responsible for System Safety in the Air Force. System acquisition and sustainment Program
Managers are subject to the mandatory policy and guidance described in paragraph 11.1.3
System safety principles are used to manage safety risks in multiple functional areas across the
AF and form the basis for operational safety risk management and management of risks within
nuclear surety activities.
   11.1.1. System Safety must be a planned, integrated, comprehensive effort employing both
   engineering and management resources. Effective System Safety efforts depend on clearly
   defined safety objectives and system performance requirements. System Safety objectives
   shall include, but not be limited to, prevention or mitigation of all reportable mishaps that
   may be associated with a system and its use and function.
   11.1.2. System Safety efforts consist of eight essential elements:
       11.1.2.1. Documenting the system safety approach.
       11.1.2.2. Hazard identification and analysis over the system life cycle.
       11.1.2.3. Assessment of mishap risk, expressed as severity and probability of
       consequences.
       11.1.2.4. Identification and assessment of potential risk mitigation measures.
       11.1.2.5. Implementation of measures to reduce risks to acceptable levels.
       11.1.2.6. Verification of risk reduction.
       11.1.2.7. Acceptance of residual risks by appropriate authorities.
       11.1.2.8. Tracking of hazards and residual risks throughout the system life cycle.
   11.1.3. These elements must be documented and periodically reviewed by program
   managers.
       11.1.3.1. Hazard tracking logs communicate sufficient information to identify and track
       the status of each hazard. To ensure appropriate management attention, the status of
       hazards is required to be presented at program and technical reviews. The System Safety
       effort supports program and technical reviews with current information of all hazards.
       The hazard tracking logs should contain:
           11.1.3.1.1. A hazard description.
           11.1.3.1.2. Unique identification information.
           11.1.3.1.3. Risk assessment information, including the initial assessment, the target
           risk level, interim assessments, as required, and the final (residual) risk assessment.
           11.1.3.1.4. Information concerning the mitigation action(s).
 94                                                   AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013


          11.1.3.1.5. Current status of the risk reduction effort.
          11.1.3.1.6. A record of user concurrence and risk acceptance by appropriate
          authorities.
       11.1.3.2. To mitigate risks, the following order of precedence is used to satisfy System
       Safety requirements and resolve identified hazards according to MIL-STD-882D, DoD
       Standard Practice for System Safety:
          11.1.3.2.1. Design for minimum risk.
          11.1.3.2.2. Incorporate safety devices.
          11.1.3.2.3. Provide warning devices.
          11.1.3.2.4. Develop procedures and training.
       11.1.3.3. Every hazard that cannot be eliminated must be accepted by the appropriate
       level of leadership as specified in AFI 63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life Cycle
       Management.
   11.1.4. The acquisition and sustainment communities implement the System Safety process
   as an integral part of a system program office's Systems Engineering activity as defined in
   AFI 63-101 and AFI 63-1201, Life Cycle Systems Engineering.
   11.1.5. Program Managers are solely responsible for organizing their offices to execute the
   System Safety requirements elaborated in the DoD and Air Force policy and instructions
   listed in paragraph 11.1.3 In particular, Acquisition and Sustainment Program Managers must
   integrate system safety risk management into their program’s overall Systems Engineering
   effort at the Integrated Product Team (IPT) level where day-to-day engineering decisions are
   being made. This allows System Safety to most effectively influence system design.
   11.1.6. For risks requiring CAE or PEO acceptance, program managers prepare a written
   safety risk assessment describing the hazards, predicted risks (stating both consequences and
   probabilities), available mitigation measures, costs or other limitations, proposed action(s),
   alternatives, resulting net mishap risk and the total of expected adverse consequences for the
   period of acceptance. For high risks, coordination with the lead command(s), PEO and
   AF/SE is required before submission for acceptance. Program managers are required to
   reassess CAE- or PEO-accepted mishap risks at least every four years and for milestone
   reviews or key decisions following risk acceptance, with consideration given to actual
   incident and loss experiences for the period and advances in mitigation technologies and
   methods. Re-validated risk assessments are then coordinated and submitted for acceptance by
   the appropriate authority for the new predicted risk levels. Attachment 15 guidance is
   mandatory for the risk assessments that accompany High risk acceptance packages and
   recommended for all other risk assessments. Formats for risk assessment packages and tools
   to help identify baseline risk, actions already taken, interim risk, potential options and
   residual risk associated with each potential option may be found on the AFSC web-site.

     11.2.3.1. Program offices must clearly define, document and adopt safety risk
     management matrices and/or tables, using MIL-STD-882D guidance, that detail
     quantified probability and event consequence severity levels, and specify approval
     authorities that will be used to manage major system/function risk within their specific
     programs. (For example, MIL-HDBK-516 defines major functions for air vehicles;
     program managers for other enterprise items may develop similar breakouts to define
     major systems/functions for their specific items).
     11.2.3.2. Program offices must document and report their safety risk management
     policies, along with current status of all high and serious risks as part of their Risk
     Management Planning. This information is required to be documented in the
     Programmatic Environment, Safety and Occupational Health Evaluation (PESHE), and
     current High- and Serious-level safety risks must be presented at each Program and
     Technical Review.
     11.2.3.3. For risks requiring CAE or PEO acceptance, program managers must prepare a
     written risk assessment describing the hazards, predicted risks (stating both consequences
     and probabilities), available mitigation measures, costs or other limitations, proposed
     action(s), alternatives, resulting net mishap risk and the total expected consequences for
     the period of acceptance. Attachment 15 guidance is mandatory for High risk acceptance
     packages and recommended for all other risk assessments.

   the program office must be validated and documented IAW the process and criteria outlined
   in AFI 10-601.
11.4. Networks, Automated Information Systems, and Non-Developmental Items. Program
managers are required to conduct a System Safety analysis appropriate for the system or item.
For non-developmental items, the analysis should review usage history, verify intended use
similarities, evaluate differences, and plan for adequate safety evaluation for all Air Force-unique
modifications or changes in use. This System Safety review should be accomplished by the
procuring/buying agency that is in the best position to assess the intended use and necessary
modification. For example, Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) certification requirements are
incrementally implemented and may not apply to all models or year groups of similar aircraft.
Operations from military fields and or with military support equipment provide unique hazard
opportunities that may not have been considered in the original design. Exercise care in
accepting FAA certification as a sufficient indication for safety of the design.
11.5. System Safety Engineering Analysis (SSEA). The SSEA program evaluates and
approves new operations that are prohibited due to the perceived risks (e.g. hot pit refueling,
integrated combat turnaround (ICT)/hot ICT, aircraft-to-aircraft servicing operations, wet
wing/rapid defueling and concurrent servicing).
   11.5.1. SSEA of a proposed operation is performed by a highly qualified team under
   controlled conditions. The team conducts actual demonstrations and analysis of the operation
   to validate overall risk assessment and recommend actions. The SSEA team is normally
   chaired by the AFMC System Safety Office and includes experts from AFSC and the
   developing, supporting and operational commands.
   11.5.2. A using command requests a SSEA in writing to AFMC/SES and informs HQ
   AFSC. Requests must include:
104                                                   AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013


      11.5.2.1. A complete description of the proposed operation.
      11.5.2.2. Justification for accepting the increased risk.
      11.5.2.3. Recommended location and dates for the SSEA demonstrations.
      11.5.2.4. Identification of other DoD, Government or foreign agencies that might be
      involved.
  11.5.3. The SSEA team reports the results of the analysis, including operational concepts,
  system descriptions, risk assessments, hazard analyses, descriptions of the demonstrations,
  and conclusions and recommendations to the requester.
AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013                                                              105

                                   HAZARD ABATEMENT

12.1. Purpose. To provide senior leaders, functional managers and supervisors with a risk-
based process or equivalent that mitigates hazardous conditions in all workplaces and operations.
The purpose of the hazard abatement program is to eliminate, control or limit exposure of
personnel to hazardous conditions.
12.2. Responsibilities.
   12.2.1. Each installation establishes a program to abate hazards based on a priority system.
   12.2.2. Commanders, supervisors and employees at all levels are responsible for abating
   hazardous conditions
   12.2.3. Commanders protect national resources, both human and material, and have the
   responsibility to take action in implementing safety measures.
   12.2.4. Functional managers correct hazards in their areas of responsibility.
   12.2.5. The safety office helps commanders determine needed abatement actions and
   provide the commander with follow-up support until the hazard is eliminated.
   12.2.6. Send projects beyond the capability of local commanders to the parent MAJCOM.
12.3. Planning and Engineering. Use risk management processes during the planning, design
and execution phases to eliminate hazards as early as possible when they will have the least cost
and operational impact on the program. Continually review plans, specifications and drawings to
identify and eliminate hazards until the equipment or workplace is operating.
12.4. Procedural Actions. Develop procedures or restrictions to minimize risk if planning or
engineering actions cannot be used to eliminate hazards. If necessary, impose restrictions such as
operational limits, frequent inspections, protective equipment or stopping the operation until
corrective action is taken.
12.5. Hazard Elimination Hierarchy. The types of hazards employees are exposed to, the
severity of the hazards and the risk the hazards pose to employees should all be considered in
determining methods of hazard prevention, elimination and control.
   12.5.1. In general, the following hierarchy should be followed in determining hazard
   elimination and control methods:
       12.5.1.1. Engineering. Engineering controls are the preferred method of reducing
       exposure to hazards, but are not always feasible. Following are examples of engineering
       controls that can be implemented.
           12.5.1.1.1. Substitution of a less hazardous material.
           12.5.1.1.2. Change process to minimize exposure to a hazard.
           12.5.1.1.3. Isolation or enclosure of a process.
           12.5.1.1.4. Ventilation of a work area.
           12.5.1.1.5. Use of local exhaust i.e. fume hoods.
 106                                                   AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013


       12.5.1.2. Administrative. Administrative control methods, such as adjusting work
       schedules, good housekeeping or encouraging best work practice can reduce hazard
       exposures.
       12.5.1.3. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). PPE to be used is determined by hazard
       identification in hazard analysis. PPE should be used when all other hazard controls have
       been exhausted or more significant hazard controls are not feasible.
   12.5.2. When engineering controls have been studied, investigated and implemented, yet still
   do not bring employees’ exposure levels to below permissible exposure limits, or when
   engineering controls are determined to be infeasible, then a combination of controls must be
   understood and followed by all affected parties.
   12.5.3. Attachment 7 through 10 provide additional instructions for assigning RACs,
   determining an abatement priority numbers and completing AF Forms 3 and 1118.
12.6. Hazard Abatement Requirements. To abate hazardous conditions:
   12.6.1. Abate hazards in military-unique equipment and processes through established
   systems for modification and upgrade (e.g., Product Quality Deficiency Reporting Program
   (T.O. 00-35D-54, USAF Material Deficiency Report and Investigation System) and Flight
   Manual Changes [AFI 11-215, Flight Manual Procedures]).
   12.6.2. Hazard abatement in nonmilitary-unique workplaces must:
       12.6.2.1. Abate RACs 1, 2 and 3 hazards as soon as possible.
       12.6.2.2. Identify abatement actions for RACs 4 and 5 hazards as soon as possible.
   12.6.3. Select an abatement method and, if possible, interim control measures based on the
   hierarchy outlined in paragraph 12.5
   12.6.4. Other factors that affect decisions on abatement actions are:
       12.6.4.1. Impact to mission.
       12.6.4.2. Technical feasibility and cost of available options.
       12.6.4.3. Number of personnel exposed and length of time exposed.
       12.6.4.4. Previous mishap experience.
       12.6.4.5. Future use of workplaces or equipment.
       12.6.4.6. Alternative methods to control the hazard or protect personnel.
       12.6.4.7. Interim control measures in effect.

12.7. Imminent Danger Situations. Anyone identifying an imminent danger situation will
immediately bring it to the attention of the commander and supervisor in charge. Commanders or
supervisors must take immediate action to eliminate or control the hazard or cease operations and
withdraw exposed personnel until the situation is safe.
12.8. Posting Hazards. The fire, safety or health officials complete the AF Form 1118
identifying RAC 1, 2 and 3 hazards according to Attachment 9 and forwards to the supervisor
for posting. If the hazard is not abated within 30 days, a copy of the AF Form 1118 will be sent
to the Wing safety office by the office assigning the RAC for addition to the master hazard
abatement program. Supervisors must alert employees to the hazardous condition, any interim
control measures and permanent corrective actions underway or programmed. Supervisors post
the AF Form 1118 in the workplace no later than the end of the next duty day after identification
of the hazard. AF Form 979, Danger Tag, may be used for this purpose on equipment. See
AFOSH Standard 91-501 or current AFOSH guidance.
   12.8.1. Location. Post AF Form 1118 on, at or as near as possible to the hazard. However,
   where the nature of the hazard or workplace is such that this is not practical, post notices in a
   prominent place where all employees can see them. The workplace supervisor must ensure
   the posted AF Form 1118 is maintained in good condition and employees are kept informed
   of any changes. If adverse conditions are present, enclose the notice in a suitable protective
   cover.
   12.8.2. Removal. The issuing office will be the authority to remove a posted AF Form 1118,
   Notice of Hazard. Removal of notices will only occur after the hazard has been corrected
   and validated by the issuing authority.
12.9. Installation Hazard Abatement Plans. Managers will ensure RACs 1, 2 and 3 hazards
not corrected within 30 days are included into a formal installation hazard abatement plan and
ensure any affected contractors or DoD civilian employees are notified. Safety staff will track
RAC 4 and 5s until closed. AF Form 3 or AF Form 1118 is optional for RACs 4 and 5.
MAJCOM may delineate additional tracking requirements.
   12.9.1. RAC 1, 2, or 3 hazards, not abated within 30 days, identified for correction are
   entered into the formal hazard abatement plan using AF Form 3. (See Attachment 10). Close
   out applicable hazard reports and inspection reports when action is transferred to AF Form 3.
   12.9.2. Safety, fire or health officials assist functional managers in preparation of the AF
   Form 3. After functional manager approves and signs the AF Form 3, it will be entered into
   formal hazard abatement plan. NOTE: Enter only one hazard on each copy of the AF Form
   3.
AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013                                                                  109


   12.9.3. The host installation safety staff maintains a complete set of AF Form 3s, which is
   the installation master hazard abatement plan.
   12.9.4. Squadron commanders or functional managers will conduct a semiannual review of
   AF Form 3s pertaining to their areas of responsibilities.
       12.9.4.1. The functional managers notify the safety personnel of any changes in hazard
       abatement status and annotate on the review AF Form 3.
       12.9.4.2. Completed hazard abatement projects must be certified by the appropriate
       agency; safety, fire, or health, to ensure the hazard was abated properly. Certification in
       this particular instance means the appropriate official has performed a site visit to verify
       that the hazard has been fully abated. Functional manager will request agency support.
   12.9.5. The Safety Council will review the installation hazard abatement plan at least once a
   year. They will address project delays and other problems on a quarterly basis.
   12.9.6. The COS will send a written copy of the installation hazard abatement plan to the
   installation commander once a year for review and approval of priorities for projects.
   12.9.7. The ground safety representative will make the installation hazard abatement plan
   available for review locally by representatives of recognized employee organizations if such
   organizations exist.
   12.9.8. MAJCOM ground safety personnel will send copies of AF Form 3s received from
   subordinate installations or units to HQ AFSC/SEG and AFMOA/ SG3P or AFCESA/DF, if
   appropriate, when MAJCOM funding authority for abatement action is exceeded.
12.10. Funding for Hazard Abatement. Funding for hazard abatement projects should be
entered into the Planning, Programming and Budget process. Hazard abatement projects should
compete for the necessary funds within the planning, programming, and budgeting system
framework.
   12.10.1. Incorporate safety, fire and health requirements into construction and modernization
   projects. For projects that exceed local funding authority, follow requirements in AFI 32-
   1021, Planning and Programming Military Construction (MILCON) Projects, and send
   projects to the parent MAJCOM for centralized programming. Identify the portion of project
   cost attributable to hazard abatement.
   12.10.2. Civil Engineering provides actual cost data for abatement of hazards in workplaces
   and real property installed equipment to the functional manager. The functional manager
   consolidates the information and sends it to the installation safety staff at least once a year for
   centralized reporting.
12.11. End of Year Annual Hazard Abatement Survey Report. Each installation safety
representative obtains information from installation civil engineering and functional managers in
order to submit an End-of-FY Annual Hazard Abatement Survey report to their MAJCOM safety
representative by 15 October each year. MAJCOM safety representatives, in turn, submit a
consolidated Annual Hazard Abatement Survey report to HQ AFSC/SEG no later than 1
November each year. FOAs and DRUs are not to submit the annual survey report if the host
installation reports their hazard abatement actions through a MAJCOM.

Terms
Assessment—Assessments determine safety program management, implementation and
effectiveness. Like program evaluations, assessments address the areas of commander and
supervisory support, compliance with program directives, and the effectiveness of mishap
prevention programs (performance). Assessments may be conducted in conjunction with the
annual safety inspection.
Air Force Hazard Communication Program (AFHCP)—Implementation of the Hazard
Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200) and AFI 90-821, Hazard Communication. The
 118                                                   AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013


purpose of the AFHCP is to reduce the incidence of chemically induced illnesses and injuries. It
informs employees of the hazards and proper preventive measures to be taken when using or
handling hazardous materials in the workplace.
Air Reserve Component (ARC)—Used when referring to both the AFRC and ANG as one
entity. All units, organizations, and members of the ANG and AFRC (10 U.S.C. 261) on active
duty, on active duty for training, or in drill status, and ANG and AFRC technicians; include
ANG and AFRC property and equipment.
Area of Responsibility (AOR)—Theater of operations for Combatant Command missions and
operations such as    US Central Command (USCENTCOM), US Northern Command
(USNORTHCOM), US European Command (USEUCOM), US Pacific Command (USPACOM)
or US Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM).
Days Away, Restricted, and/or Transfer Case Incidence Rate—The rate of all civilian
injuries and illnesses resulting in days away from work, restricted work activity, and/or job
transfer. This rate is calculated for a work site for a specified period of time (usually one year).
Department of Defense Civilian Personnel—Includes Senior Executive Service (SES), General
Schedule (GS), National Security Personnel System (NSPS) and federal wage system employees,
including ANG and AFRC technicians, unless in military duty status. Includes non-appropriated
fund employees who are not military personnel working part time; Corps of Engineers Civil
Works employees; Youth Opportunity Program (YOP) and student assistance program
employees; Direct-Hire Foreign-national civilians employed by the Air Force (Air Force Foreign
Nationals [AFFN]) and Army-Air Force Exchange Service employees.
Department of the Air Force Military Personnel—These are Air Force personnel on active
duty with the Air Force or ANG and AFRC personnel on military duty status. Includes Air Force
Academy cadets and Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) cadets engaged in directed training
activities. Includes members of other US military services serving on extended active duty with
the Air Force or foreign-national military personnel assigned to the Air Force.
Designated Employee Representative—An individual selected by civilian employees, either
directly or through an exclusive representation bargaining agreement, to represent them as a
member of the safety and environmental councils and to take part in other activities as outlined
in this instruction.
Evaluations—Method of appraising the effectiveness of mishap prevention program
management. Addresses the areas of commander supervisory support, compliance with program
directives and the effectiveness of mishap prevention programs (performance).
Fire Hazard—A condition that can cause a fire to occur. The distinction between fire hazard
and fire safety deficiency (FSD) is important because the documentation, reporting, and
correction procedures differ for each. Only fire hazards are included in the Hazard Abatement
Plan and FSDs are managed separately.
Fire Safety Deficiency (FSD)—A condition which reduces fire safety below the acceptable
level, including noncompliance with standards, but by itself cannot cause a fire to occur. A clear
distinction between hazards and deficiencies may not always be possible; therefore, the judgment
and experience of qualified fire official must be relied upon. Fire safety deficiencies will not be
assigned RAC 1, 2, or 3.
AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013                                                                119


Full-time—Individuals in primary duty safety positions. See definition for safety and health
officials. Does not include additional duty safety personnel such as USRs and SAFSOs.
Functional Managers—The senior operating official at all levels exercising managerial control
of an activity or operation. This individual usually can acquire and commit resources for the
abatement of occupational safety and health hazards. Functional managers are designated by
MAJCOM or installation commanders.
Hazard—A condition, procedure or practice that creates a potential for producing death, injury,
illness, fire, property damage, equipment damage or environmental damage.
Hazard/Deficiency Abatement— Eliminating or permanently reducing a hazard by complying
with applicable safety requirements or taking equivalent protective measures.
Hazard/Deficiency Severity—An assessment of the expected consequences if a hazard, if left
unabated, results in a mishap. The Air Force defines severity by the degree of injury, illness, or
resource damage that can result from a specific mishap.
Hazard Reporting— A process, by which any person assigned, attached or under contract to the
Air Force, may report a hazard. This includes any event or condition that affects aviation,
ground, weapons or space. Hazards to be reported include unsafe procedures, conditions or
practices. Hazards must be reported to their responsible supervisor or local agency. If the hazard
cannot be eliminated immediately, notify the local safety office using an Form 457, USAF
Hazard Report (HR) or by telephone or in person.
High Interest Areas—These areas have the greatest risk to life or property damage, experienced
repeated mishaps, or in the judgment of the safety office requires added oversight. They can also
be work areas or operations that need additional attention or inspections because of increased
mishap potential due to the nature of work performed, physical conditions or type of materials
handled.
High Risk Activities—These are activities having a higher potential for personnel injury due to
the level of competition, speed, risk, or skills needed and requiring greater agility, stamina and
dexterity. Some examples of high-risk activities are flying civil aircraft, hang gliding, skydiving,
parasailing, white-water rafting, motorcycling and auto racing, scuba diving, bungee jumping
and bronco and bull riding. NOTE: MAJCOMs can determine within the command what are
considered high risk activities.
Imminent Danger—Conditions or practices in a workplace which could reasonably be expected
to cause death or severe physical harm immediately or before such dangers can be eliminated
through normal abatement procedures. NOTE: RAC 1 hazards are classified as imminent
danger.
Informal Report—A report with no particular format. (e.g. spot inspection, high interest, etc.)
Inspections—The process of determining compliance with safety and health standards through
physical surveys of workplaces, operations, and facilities.
Interim Control Measure—Temporary action taken to reduce the degree of risk associated with
a hazard pending completion of an abatement project.
Job Safety Training Guide—Information placed in a specific format designed to lead
supervisors through a series of steps or courses of action ensuring required safety training is
 120                                                  AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013


provided for all employees. The JSTG is prepared by supervisors to train personnel upon initial
assignment or when work conditions or tasks change.
Job Safety Training Outline (JSTO)—An outline of mandatory safety training items that
supervisors use to prepare a job safety training guide. The JSTO is used by supervisors as a
template to prepare a Job Safety Training Guide for their specific work areas. See Attachment 5.
Joint Activity Service Billet—An activity, operation or organization in which elements of more
than one Military Department of the United States, as reflected in joint manpower programs
documents, perform joint missions under auspices of OSD, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff or the commander of a combatant or combined command.

The term military-unique refers to military and civilian operations, systems and equipment that
are unique to the national defense mission and military services. These operations, systems and
equipment are exempted from the scope of the OSHA Act. An example of the Air Force
operations, systems and equipment that are unique to the national defense mission are military
aircraft, missiles and missile sites, early warning systems, military space systems, ammunition,
military flight operations, chemical warfare gear, associated research test and development
activities, and actions required under emergency conditions.
Mishap—A mishap is an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in damage
or injury and meets Class A, B, C, D and E mishap reporting criteria IAW AFI 91-204. Damage
or injury includes: damage to DoD property or equipment; environmental damage; occupational
illness to DoD military or civilian personnel; injury to DoD military personnel on- or off-duty;
injury to on-duty DoD civilian personnel; damage to public or private property, or injury or
illness to non-DoD personnel caused by Air Force operations.
National Consensus Standards—Standards published by recognized standards organizations
such as the ANSI, NFPA, American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists,
Compressed Gas Association, and NIOSH. National consensus standards adopted by OSHA are
part of OSHA standards.
Notice of Hazard—A written warning of a condition, procedure, or practice which constitutes a
hazard. As used in the context of this instruction, "Notice of Hazard" refers to AF Form 1118.
Occupational Deficiency—Conditions, procedures, and practices that are in non-compliance
with OSHA or AFOSH requirements, but do not, in themselves, create a potential for producing
an occupational injury or illness mishap. Deficiencies may, however, create a potential for
secondary injuries or illnesses or may contribute to the severity of an injury or illness that has
already occurred. Example include lack of fire detection or suppression equipment and systems,
broken smoke alarm, lack of exit signs, and railings which are two inches below standard height.
A clear distinction between hazards and deficiencies may not always be possible; therefore, the
judgment and experience of qualified safety, fire protection, and health personnel must be relied
upon.
AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013                                                                 121

and responsibilities with performance standards.
Quality Assurance Personnel— Individuals designated to perform quality assessment
functions, and manage performance in accordance with the Performance Plan. They serve as on-
site technical managers assessing contractor performance against contract performance
standards. Personnel in this area have many titles, such as Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE),
Quality Assurance Specialist (QAS), Functional Area Evaluators (FAEs) (A&AS), and
Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR).
Quality Assurance Program Coordinator (QAPC)— Mission support group or
AFMC/AFSPC Center-level individual, normally from the contracting activity, selected to
coordinate and manage the Performance Management Assessment Program (Quality Assurance
Program).
Qualified Safety, Fire Protection, Bioenvironmental Engineering and Health Officials—Air
Force civilian and military personnel assigned to full time positions for the respective disciplines.
Air Force civilian personnel who meet the Office of Personnel Management standards for safety
and occupational health manager or specialist, safety engineering technician, safety engineer, fire

Spot Inspection—These inspections are no-notice inspections to check the day-to-day safety
and health of an organization, work center, facility, etc. Documentation requirements for spot
inspections are established by the MAJCOM, NAF, DRU or FOA, or safety office. Minimum
documentation will include date, inspector’s name and their organization or office symbol,
organization or activity inspected, a brief description of the areas, equipment or
processes/procedures reviewed as well as observations (may also include positive findings),
hazards or unsafe work practices, causes of deficiencies and hazards, as noted, recommendations
for corrective action and name and phone number of responsible person.
Standards—Safety and health standards (including emergency temporary standards) issued
under the OSH Act of 1970. This includes national consensus standards adopted by OSHA by
reference.
System Safety Groups (SSGs)— Augment the program office system safety function; it is not a
substitute or replacement. While many SSG members are not assigned to the Program Office,
they advise the system program manager or single manager on safety matters. They act as an
integrated product team (IPT) for system safety. The members assist the program office in
identifying risks, assessing these risks, and recommending solutions to these risks. The SSG
includes safety experts associated with the particular weapon system.
System Safety Working Groups (SSWGs)— Are a subset of System Safety Groups (SSGs).
SSWGs are usually formed when a full SSG wants to research a problem without tying-up the
full membership. The SSG will generally form an SSWG to work a problem separately and
report back to the SSG. An SSWG augments an SSG; it's not a substitute.
Team Concept—A diverse group of individuals working together with complementary skills
who are committed to a common purpose, have group goals, take an approach for which they are
mutually accountable.
Total Case Incidence Rate (TCIR)—A number that represents the total recordable civilian
injuries and illnesses per 100 full-time employees, calculated for a worksite for a specified
period of time (usually one year).
Unit Safety Committee—Organized and maintained to monitor and assist an agency’s safety
and health program. The committee assists in helping to maintain an open channel of
communication between employees and management in the workplace. The committees provide
a method by which employees can utilize their knowledge of workplace operations to assist
management with improving policies, conditions, and practices. NOTE: The term “team
concept” is used synonymously with “safety committee”.
Urgent Action Notice—Significant event notifications sent out by the Air Force Service Watch
Center (AFSWC). These notifications are also called AFSWC notifications.
Variance—An approved temporary or permanent change to a procedure, criterion, or rule
prescribed in safety standards which provides the same degree of protection to personnel.
Workplace—The physical location where work is performed for the Air Force by Air Force
personnel or where Air Force operations take place.

A3.1. General. Hazard air traffic report information is vital to Air Force flight safety. This
attachment establishes procedures for reporting and investigating near midair collisions (NMAC)
and other hazardous air traffic conditions. Report all HATR incidents using the AF Form 651,
Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR). Use of information taken from these reports is for mishap
prevention only and not for disciplinary actions. HATR information is not privileged information
and is releasable outside Air Force channels except for the identity of the personnel involved.
A3.2. Reportable Incidents.
   A3.2.1. NMAC. Aircrew took abrupt evasive action to avoid a collision or would have taken
   evasive action if circumstances allowed. NOTE: In many cases, the term AIRMISS is the
   terminology used for European incidents.
   A3.2.2. Air Traffic Control (ATC). Any ATC service that did or could contribute to a
   hazardous air traffic condition. Example: Failure by ATC to maintain required separation
   between aircraft under their control.
   A3.2.3. Aircrew Deviation. Any aircrew actions that did or could contribute to a hazardous
   air traffic condition.
   A3.2.4. Communication or Navigational Aid (NAVAID). An equipment indication/
   malfunction that did or could contribute to a hazardous air traffic condition.
   A3.2.5. Procedural Guidance. Procedures described in any publication or directive that did
   or could contribute to a hazardous air traffic condition.
   A3.2.6. Ground Incidents. Any occurrence on the movement area that endangered an
   airborne aircraft or an aircraft operating on the ground.
   A3.2.7. TCAS Resolution Advisories (RA). TCAS RAs (involving USAF aircraft/RPA) that
   require the aircraft/RPA to deviate from an assigned clearance. This includes USAF
   aircraft/RPA triggering TCAS RA aboard civil or other DoD aircraft.
A3.3. Responsibilities of the Unit Commander. Unit commanders will ensure AF Form 651 is
available to aircrews at base operations workplaces, flying squadron operations offices, in trip
kits and in USAF ATC workplaces. Commanders must emphasize the importance of identifying
hazardous situations through the HATR program and encourage the filing of appropriate HATRs
as a method of preventing future mishaps.
A3.4. Responsibility of the Individual Filing the HATR. Any person (e.g., air traffic
controller, pilot, safety officer, etc.) aware that a reportable event occurred shall file a HATR.
Report the details on AF Form 651 in the following manner.
   A3.4.1. If the individual is at the Air Force base where the incident occurred, file the report
   within 24 hours to the base safety office.
   A3.4.2. If the incident occurred at another location (other than home station); report the

   A3.4.3. If an aircrew experiences a NMAC, and circumstances permit, immediately (e.g.,
   while airborne) inform the nearest ATC agency, civil aviation authority (CAA) for overseas
   incidents, or flight service station and provide the following information:
       A3.4.3.1. Identification or call sign.
       A3.4.3.2. Time and place (name of NAVAID, radial and distance, and latitude/longitude
       coordinates if available) of incident.
       A3.4.3.3. Altitude or flight level.
       A3.4.3.4. Description of other aircraft in the incident.
       A3.4.3.5. Advise the controlling agency a written NMAC report will be filed and request
       that all available data be saved.
NOTE: Aircrews, who experience a NMAC under FAA control, should request that facility to
initiate a FAA NMAC report.
A3.5. Responsibilities of the Safety Office Receiving a HATR. Within 24 hours after
notification of the incident, the safety office receiving the HATR determines which safety office
is responsible for the investigation. Fax the AF Form 651 to the appropriate safety office. Follow
this order of priority:
   A3.5.1. If applicable complies with host nation agreements.
   A3.5.2. If foreign ATC or aircraft are involved, the overseas MAJCOM.

                                   MISHAP RESPONSE

A4.1. General. Pre-mishap response planning by safety staffs must address appropriate
participation in all base-level responses, including:
   A4.1.1. Major mishaps.
   A4.1.2. Hazardous materials mishaps.
   A4.1.3. Natural disasters.
   A4.1.4. Nuclear weapons mishaps.
   A4.1.5. Conventional munitions incidents.
   A4.1.6. Directed Energy Weapons mishaps
A4.2. The basic response planning document for Major Accident Response, Natural Disasters,
Enemy Attack, and Distribution is AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management Program
Planning and Operations.
A4.3. Planning Factors. Use the following in developing your Comprehensive Emergency
Management Plan (CEMP) for all accidents, incidents and unusual occurrences: AFI 10-2501.
A4.4. Emergency Operations Center (EOC). The EOC responds to peacetime major
accidents and natural disasters to provide on-scene command and control of Air Force military
resources and functional expertise. The EOC and its members will meet the requirements in AFI
10-2501.
NOTE: Ideally, the safety representative to the EOC should not be responsible for assembling
the interim safety board (ISB).
A4.5. Source Documents for Specific Planning Criteria. The primary source of detailed
planning guidance for safety staffs is AFPAM 91-211, USAF Guide to Aviation Safety
Investigation. The former contains a “Mishap Response Checklist” for EOC safety representative
and guidance for developing a unit control center checklist; the latter describes specialized
equipment requirements and an expanded set of tasks for interim safety board members.
A4.6. Safety Response to Other than Major Peacetime Accidents. Some mishaps may not
warrant a full activation of the Disaster Response Force (DRF). However, the safety staff may
need some EOC elements to support investigation of these less severe incidents, such as Combat
Camera or Civil Engineering Specialists. Each safety staff should consult with their supporting
base readiness flight (disaster preparedness function) to determine how to formally provide for
partial EOC support when the full DRF is not activated.
A4.7. Munitions Rapid Response Team. The 84th Combat Sustainment Wing has developed a
conventional munitions rapid response team to support Air Force units throughout the world
anytime a munitions incident occurs. The team is made up of experts (engineers, equipment
specialists, program managers, and safety personnel) from the conventional weapons and
 130                                                AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013


munitions programs. These personnel are able to travel anywhere in the world within 24 to 48
hours to assist in determining the cause of a failure. If your MAJCOM or unit has an incident,
and this team’s help is desired, contact 84th Combat Sustainment Wing to request support by

                               JOB SAFETY ANALYSIS (JSA)

A6.1. Sequence Of Basic Steps: Break the task down into its basic steps. For example, what is
done first, what is done next? You can do this by: (1) observing the task, (2) discussing it with
workers, (3) using your experience and knowledge of the task, or (4) a combination of all three.
Record the steps in the task in their normal order of occurrence. Describe what is done; not the
details or how it is done. Three or four words are normally enough to describe each task step.
A6.2. Potential Mishap Causes Or Hazards: For each task step, ask yourself what mishap
could happen to workers performing the task and what the probability would be of the mishap
occurring. Get the answers by: (1) observing the task, (2) discussing the task with workers
and/or (3) using “lessons learned” from other mishaps. Ask the questions:
   A6.2.1. Can workers be struck by or contacted by anything?
   A6.2.2. Can they strike against or be exposed to any item that can cause injury?
   A6.2.3. Can they be caught in or between anything?
   A6.2.4. Can they fall?
   A6.2.5. Can they overexert themselves?
   A6.2.6. Are they required to do repetitive lifting or heavy lifting?
   A6.2.7. Are there potential hazards such as chemical substances, physical agents (including
   noise, ergonomic and thermal stress), ionizing and non-ionizing radiation or biological
   exposures?
A6.3. Recommended Safe Task Procedure: For each potential mishap cause or hazard
identified, consider the following questions:
   A6.3.1. How should workers perform the task step to avoid the mishap or eliminate the
   potential hazard?
   A6.3.2. What can be done to eliminate or mitigate the hazard by redesigning the work area
   or equipment?
   A6.3.3. How can the procedure be modified to eliminate the hazard? NOTE: Be sure to
   describe in detail the precautions workers must take and ensure that these steps are placed in
   the task procedure or checklist. Take special care to ensure important steps or details are not
   inadvertently omitted from the task and that guidance is clear, specific and easily understood
   by workers.

                               RISK ASSESMENT CODES (RAC)

A7.1. Risk Assessment Codes: are tools used by Fire, Safety and Health staffs and
Commanders to prioritize the abatement plans and mitigate hazards. It may not be possible to
assign a RAC to every hazard or circumstance and the lack of a RAC should not dissuade efforts
to mitigate risks.
      A7.1.1. This instruction describes the basic RAC codes and provides some guidelines for
      assigning priorities based on cost, effectiveness and exposure. The discipline specific
      chapters also provide additional guidance for assessing the risks of the applicable hazards.
      A7.1.2. Risk Assessment Codes. Qualified safety, fire protection, and health personnel
      evaluate each safety hazard/deficiency and assign a RAC (Table A7.1) to
      hazards/deficiencies. Determine the RAC by plotting the probability (A, B, C, or D) that a
      mishap will occur and the potential mishap severity (I, II, III, or IV) if it does happen.

                            ABATEMENT PRIORITY NUMBER

A8.1. The abatement priority number (APN) is a two-part code: the RAC and the cost
effectiveness index (CEI). CEI measures cost effectiveness of a hazard abatement project and
represents a ratio of the project cost and its potential effectiveness. The APN will be used to
determine the relative priority of abatement actions. Use the APN in establishing funding
priorities for hazard abatement projects during the budgetary cycle. Compute APN:
   A8.1.1. Step 1. Determine RAC from Table A7.1, based on mishap severity and probability
   of occurrence.
   A8.1.2. Step 2. Determine the severity probability multiplier (M) from the matrix in Table
   A8.1, using the same severity and probability used to determine the RAC.

Table A8.1. Severity and Probability Multiplier Matrix.
NOTE: The multipliers in table represent a proportional distribution of the severity and
frequency of mishaps.
A8.1.3. Step 3. Determine exposure (E), or the average number of personnel exposed daily to
the hazard during the course of the year.
   A8.1.4. Step 4. Determine the total abatement project cost (C). If actual costs are not known,
   use best available estimate.
   A8.1.5. Step 5. Compute the CEI by dividing the C for abatement by the product of M and
   E, or CEI = C/ (M) (E).
   A8.1.6. Step 6. Determine APN by listing the RAC followed by the CEI in parenthesis, or
   APN = RAC (CEI).
   A8.1.7. Step 7. Determine relative priority of abatement projects by comparing the CEI of
   projects within identical RACs. NOTE: The lower the CEI, the higher its relative priority
   within the same RAC.
A8.2. To use APNs to establish a priority list of projects, follow these steps:
   A8.2.1. Step 1. Determine RAC. Assumptions: Given a hazard that will probably occur in
   time (Probability B) and would result in a permanent partial disabling injury (Severity II) if it
   resulted in a mishap. Therefore, the assigned RAC from Table A8.1 would be 2.
   A8.2.2. Step 2. Determine multiplier (M). Plot mishap probability (B) versus hazard severity
   (II) on Table A7.1 to obtain a multiplier of 21.
   A8.2.3. Step 3. Determine exposure (E). Assumption: The functional manager or supervisor
   determined that on an average day 25 people are exposed to the hazard.
   A8.2.4. Step 4. Determine the total cost of project (C). Assumption: The total cost of the
   project to abate the hazard as provided to the functional manager by Civil Engineering is
   $2,100.
   A8.2.5. Step 5. Determine CEI. CEI = C/ (M) (E); (M) (E) = 21x25, therefore CEI = 2100/
   (21) (25) = 4.

   A8.2.6. Step 6. Determine APN. APN will be (RAC) (CEI) = (2) (4).
   A8.2.7. Step 7. Determine relative priority. The APN will now be used to prioritize this
   project in relation to other RAC 2s for which APNs have been computed. A hypothetical
   priority listing containing this project is shown in table A8.2.

         PRE-DEPARTURE SAFETY BRIEFING GUIDE (EXAMPLES ONLY)

A11.1. Purpose. Help military and civilian employees on orders, especially those under the age
of 26, reduce the potential for a traffic mishap by identifying and mitigating risks involving
travel by private motor vehicle for leave, PCS and temporary duty assignments.
A11.2. Overview. Commanders, managers and supervisors will help guide and mentor
employees in applying personal risk management when planning for a trip. Consider the
following factors to guide the discussion on assessing risk and identifying mitigating strategies,
but also consider and address other factors based on the unique nature of each situation. This
interactive briefing may be documented on AF Form 4392, Pre-Departure Safety Briefing Form.
   A11.2.1. Urge the driver to carefully and thoroughly plan the trip, allowing time for rest
   prior to departure and to take a break at least every two hours.
   A11.2.2. Travelers are not to drive more than 10 hours during any 24-hour period.
   Motorcyclists are highly encouraged to travel fewer hours. Highly recommend that travelers
   get a good night’s sleep (7-8 hours) while traveling.
   A11.2.3. Airmen must ensure they have sufficient funds available to cover expenses (a
   shortage of funds often leads to exhausting, marathon driving).
   A11.2.4. Travelers must check the weather forecast for the intended route of travel.
   A11.2.5. Discourage driving during late night hours. Remind the traveler that there is a
   greater chance to encounter impaired (intoxicated, fatigued) drivers on the road at night than
   during the day.
   A11.2.6. Stress the value of occupant restraint devices (mandatory for military personnel),
   including child restraints and the use of helmets and personal protective equipment by
   motorcyclists; review the hazard of reduced visibility due to factors such as darkness,
   weather, sun glare; and touch on the issue of being alert for road hazards such as animals
   crossing the roadway, stalled or slow-moving vehicles, and so forth.
   A11.2.7. Stress the importance of vehicle condition — vehicle defects also contribute to
   mishaps.
   A11.2.8. Discuss the main causes of injury and death by vehicle mishaps in the Air Force,
   which include speeding or excessive speed for conditions, fatigue, inattention or distraction,
   not wearing seatbelts and the effects of medication and alcohol.
A11.3. Additional Information. Advise the member to contact their unit commander, first
sergeant, flight commander, immediate supervisor or command post in the event of a mishap or
if an emergency situation arises. Ensure the individual is provided the phone numbers of the
points of contact.
A11.4. DELETE.
A11.5. DELETE.

             AIR FORCE OFF-DUTY HIGH-RISK ACTIVITIES PROGRAM

A12.1. Purpose. The Off-duty High Risk Activity (HRA) Program is a recommended
management tool for commanders and supervisors. The intent of the program is to ensure
participants are familiar with the hazards and injury potential associated with their particular
activity. This program is intended for military personnel only.
A12.2. High-Risk Activities. These are activities having a higher potential for personal injury
due to the level of competition, speed, risk or skills needed and requiring greater agility, stamina
and dexterity. Some examples of high-risk activities are flying civil aircraft, hang gliding,
skydiving, parasailing, white-water rafting, motorcycle and auto racing, scuba diving, bungee
jumping, bronco and bull riding, and extreme sports or any activity identified by the commander.
NOTE: MAJCOMs can determine within the command what are considered high risk activities.
A12.3. Commander's/Supervisors Responsibility. Commanders or supervisors should ensure
all personnel are briefed about the HRA program regardless of their participation in high-risk
activities. Each individual should be surveyed and if it is determined they are actively engaged or
about to engage in an HRA they should meet one on one with their commander or supervisor.
Ideally implemented, a HRA interview is not a briefing. It is for the purpose determining the
mental and physical readiness, and situational awareness preparedness of participants before the
HRA occurs. The interviewer can discuss with the interviewee the risks of the activities and
ascertain some idea of the likelihood that the participant can enjoy the activity without an
unacceptable level of risk. Through this process the interviewer can determine such things as
level of experience, knowledge of PPE requirements, physical safety aspects of the area of
participation, level of supervision or oversight by qualified professional staffs or officials, rules
or recommended practices of professional organizations, and so on. It is also a chance to discuss
the mental and physical preparedness of the participant. If interviewers determine participants
are not adequately trained or are inexperienced, they should encourage participants to seek
additional training through a nationally recognized institute before participating in the activity.
A12.4. Individual Responsibility. Individuals planning to engage in high-risk activities such as
those described in paragraph A12.2, should be encouraged to inform his or her immediate
supervisor, and schedule an interview their supervisor, squadron commander or designee. The
individual engaging in a high-risk activity is responsible for applying sound risk management
practices to avoid jeopardizing life or limbs and their ability to perform their Air Force duties.
A12.5. Documentation. AF Form 4391, High-Risk Activities Worksheet, may be used to
document the briefing, completed by the squadron commander, individual’s supervisor, safety
officer or training manager.

                         PREPARATION OF RISK ASSESSMENTS

A15.1. Risk Assessment. A risk assessment succinctly documents the results of several steps in
the risk management process and supports follow-on decision-making processes (Reference AFI
90-901, Operational Risk Management; and AFPAM 90-902, Operational Risk Management
Guidelines and Tools). Decision options typically involve determining whether one or more
particular courses of action should be pursued (e.g., implementing equipment improvements,
safety or warning device improvements, operational improvements, technical improvements,
policy improvements, etc.), or whether a risk should be accepted. A risk assessment supports
decision-making processes by objectively identifying a hazard, assessing its risk, thoroughly
analyzing potential options for risk mitigation and making a recommendation. NOTE: The term
“losses” also include fatalities, not just system losses. A suggested risk assessment format is
shown in A15.1 below:
A15.1. Sample Risk Assessment Layout
                                    Risk Assessment Title
Background: Broadly describe the situation being evaluated. Provide enough detail so the
remainder of the risk assessment can be easily understood.

Hazard Identification: Hazards are defined as any real or potential condition that can cause
mission degradation, illness or injury to personnel or damage to or loss of equipment or property.
Accurately and succinctly describe the hazard (e.g., deficiency with engineering design, material,
quality, software, operations, maintenance, etc.) being analyzed.

Initial Risk: Risk is the probability and severity of loss from exposure to the hazard. Risk
assessment is the application of qualitative and quantitative measures to determine the level of
risk associated with the identified hazard. Identify the probability and severity of a mishap that
could result from the hazard based upon the exposure of personnel or assets to the identified
hazard. Use the baseline or “as designed” state as the basis for determining initial risk. Fully
explain the methodology used, data considered (e.g., reported mishaps/events, deficiency reports,
test results, etc) and rationale for determining baseline risk.

Interim Risk: Many times initial mitigation steps have already been taken prior to the
completion of a written risk assessment. These steps may include permanent risk mitigation
measures or temporary stop-gap risk mitigation measures. Describe these measures and explain
how the baseline risk is being mitigated, their effectiveness and the resulting interim risk until
final risk mitigating options can be implemented.

Risk Mitigation Options – It is likely several options still exist to mitigate the risk of the
indentified hazard. Effective control measures reduce or eliminate one of the three components
(i.e., probability, severity or exposure) of risk. Investigate specific strategies and tools that
reduce, mitigate or eliminate risk. Address each risk mitigation option separately. One option to
always consider is “taking no further action” which is the equivalent of accepting the baseline
 150                                                   AFI91-202_AFSOCSUP_I 9 JULY 2013


risk and acknowledging and accepting expected future losses. For each option, including
accepting the baseline risk, address:

       Description: Describe the option being evaluated.

       Impact: Describe the impact of this option. What are its benefits; limitations? Address
       its effectiveness and explain how it will eliminate or control future losses. Does it address
       other hazards/problems or introduce new ones?

       Cost: Estimate the costs (i.e., financial, operational, maintenance, etc.) to implement this
       option.

       Schedule: Estimate schedule implement this option.

       Residual Risk: Great risk mitigation options eliminate hazards and their risk entirely;
       others only reduce the risk. Assuming this risk mitigation option is implemented; identify
       the probability and severity of a mishap that could result from the hazard based upon the
       exposure of personnel or assets to the identified hazard. Fully explain the methodology
       used (including analytical assumptions and limitations), data considered, and rationale for
       determining residual risk.

       Expected Future Losses: Estimate the expected losses with implementation of this
       option. Express losses over a period of time, a number of events or for a given
       population. Fully explain the methodology used, data considered and rationale for
       determining these expected losses.

Summary of Options: If the number of risk mitigation options is lengthy, a tabular summary
may be appropriate. Include as appropriate.

Recommendation: State the recommended course(s) of action, including rationale.

Attachments: Include more detailed or supporting information, as required.
