  photographs and negatives, waste and other mixtures and forms, and excess fine precious
  metals will be turned-in to DRMO.
  3.2. Excess and condemned items bearing precious metals will be turned in to the DRMO as

  placed in column 62 of the Disposal Turn In Document (DTID) (Computer generated 1348-
  1).
  3.3. Excess fine precious metals will be turned in to the DRMO by the NSN assigned.

  from plating shops, and recovery cartridges will be turned-in to the DRMO on separate
  DTIDs.
  3.5. Silver, gold, and platinum scrap generated as a result of grinding, drilling, cutting, etc.,
  will be turned in identifying the type of scrap in blocks “w” through “y.”
  3.6. All other precious metals bearing scrap will be turned in to the DRMO on a DTID
  except that weight will be measured in weight by pounds and blocks "w" through "y" will be
  annotated precious metals bearing scrap.
4. PMRP TRAINING:
  4.1. The PMRP Manager will provide on-the-job training for installation and organization
  monitors. This training will include: record keeping, accountability of precious metals,
  receipt and turn-in of precious metals, and safeguarding precious metal materials (IAW
  AFI31-101).
5. RESOURCES PROTECTION:
  5.1. All AF activities must be guided by AFI 31-101 when establishing protection
  requirements for fine precious metals, precious metals bearing scrap, and high content
  precious metals bearing items.
