ARW VA 33-397, Stop-Do Not Use for Classified Reproduction (Attachment 5).See Attachment
7 for additional information on clearing the machine.
NOTE: Copiers will be designated classified by the unit commander by using the AF Form 3215
and routing it through the unit security manager to 507 CF/SCO.
6. Network Security Issues. Units must complete an AF Form 3215 for any machine requiring
network connectivity. The form will be routed through 507 CF/SCO (Network Control Center) to
507 CF/SCB (Information Assurance) for approval.
