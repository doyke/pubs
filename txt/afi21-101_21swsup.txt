14.10.1.1. (Added) 21SW activities that provide host unit responsibilities for flightline
operations will establish a CDDAR program IAW AFI21-101. Aircraft recovery procedures must
be tailored specifically by each host base in order to address capabilities unique to its location.
These procedures must be developed and collaborated jointly with all applicable host and tenant
units and published in an Installation Publication or supplement to AFI21-101.
14.10.1.2. (Added) 21 SW/CC will:
14.10.1.2.1. (Added) Implement policy, plans and agreements to ensure compliance with
