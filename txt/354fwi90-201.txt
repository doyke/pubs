                                           Chapter 1

                                   GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. Overview. All 354 FW/IG-directed exercises are implemented under the authority of the
354 FW Commander and are planned and executed by the 354 FW Exercise Evaluation Team
(EET). The Chief of Exercises and Inspections, 354 FW/IGI, is the OPR for all 354 FW
Operational Readiness Exercises (ORE) and Emergency Management Exercises (EME).
Exercises are planned and executed in accordance with AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency
Management Programming and Operations, PACAFSUP 90-201, PACAF Ability to Survive and
Operate Rodeo Concept of Operation, and this instruction. The primary purpose of 354 FW/IG-
directed exercises is to provide the Wing Commander with an independent assessment of wing
readiness for wartime, contingency, and emergency management responsibilities. The secondary
purpose is to provide an appropriate training venue for wing and unit critical functions and
responsibilities. Specific Letters of Instruction (LOIs) will provide additional guidance for each
exercise. Additionally, the 354 FW / 168 ARW Exercise Plan (EXPLAN) provides
supplemental guidance specific for OREs.
1.2. Exercise Schedule. The 354 FW/IG will develop an annual exercise schedule, approved by
the 354 FW/CC. All 354 FW assigned/attached units are subject to 354 FW/IG-directed
exercises at any time.
     1.2.1. OREs may be short or no-notice, but are typically scheduled and announced in
     advance to maximize the availability of all personnel.
     1.2.2. EMEs may be short or no-notice, but may be announced in advance to maximize the
     availability of key personnel. EME vulnerability windows may be established to ensure the
     EME does not conflict with other wing events. EMEs may be combined with OREs and may
     combine multiple scenarios to fulfill several requirements.
1.3. Safety. All personnel are responsible for ensuring that all flight and ground safety
directives are followed. Any person may intervene in any situation in order to prevent injury or
facility/equipment damage.
1.4. Security. Personnel must be particularly vigilant in adhering to Operations Security
(OPSEC), Communications Security (COMSEC), and other security practices during exercises.
Any person may intervene in specific exercise activity to protect classified materials or prevent
inadvertent disclosure.
1.5. Exercise Communication. The IG work-center (IGWC) is the location of the White Cell,
BEARCAT CONTROL, and will serve as all higher headquarters (HHQ) and off-base agencies
for all exercise events unless specified in the Letters of Instruction. Any subordinate reports,
requests for information, or support will be done through the White Cell/BEARCAT CONTROL
in lieu of actually transmitting the message to the outside agency. White Cell/BEARCAT
CONTROL will respond to inquiries in a format and timeframe commensurate with the scenario
and simulated agency.
1.6. Play Area. All of Eielson AFB, unless specifically designated as a no-play area/facility, is
considered an exercise play area. Additionally, 354 FW/IGI may coordinate specific off-base
354FWI90-201 21 AUGUST 2013                                                                     5


exercise play areas as required. Personnel inside no-play facilities or outside of designated play
areas are not required to respond to exercise events.
   1.6.1. Approved No Play Areas. The following areas are considered no play areas for all
   exercises unless specified in the LOIs governing the exercise.
       1.6.1.1. All military family housing areas, dormitories and campgrounds, to exclude
       government facilities located in housing areas (e.g., housing fire department).
       1.6.1.2. All schools and school grounds.
       1.6.1.3. All child development and school age program facilities. Each facility will
       implement appropriate Force Protection Condition (FPCON) measures as deemed
       necessary by the owning commander. EXCEPTION: If the Youth Center, Bldg 5513,
       is activated as the alternate Medical Group facility during contingency operations, the
       facility will become a play area.
       1.6.1.4. Contractor construction sites and maintenance facilities.
   1.6.2. Limited Play Areas.
       1.6.2.1. AAFES/DECA, Yukon Club, Aurora Club, Bowling Center, Outdoor Rec, Ski
       Lodge, Arts and Crafts/ITT Office, Auto Hobby, Wood Skills, Birch Lake, Skeet and
       Trap, Eielson City Center, Gold Rush Inn, Teen Break, Youth Center, DFAC,
       Commisary, Base Exchange, and other revenue generating facilities are considered
       limited play areas for all exercises unless specified in the LOIs governing the exercise.
       Facilities will follow the guidance listed in the PACAF standard simulation number 2.11.
       1.6.2.2. Airman Leadership School, First Term Airman Center, and Education center will
       implement FPCON measures as directed. The owning commander may request waivers
       or simulations for FPCON actions that impact activities at the classroom level.
1.7. Participation. All military personnel, government civilian employees, and civilian
contractors whose contract allows exercise participation will participate in all exercises. All
assigned and tenant units will participate in all exercises. All personnel will respond
appropriately to exercise events while in the play area. Personnel on medical profiles will react
IAW the limitations of their profile.
   1.7.1. Nonparticipants. Nonparticipants must be designated in writing according to the
   procedures outlined in the LOIs governing the exercise. They will not participate in or
   interfere with exercise events. The LOIs will specify how nonparticipants will be clearly
   identifiable to participants and EET.
   1.7.2. Incomplete IPE/CWDE. Commanders must equip tasked ATSO participants
   appropriately. All tasked ATSO participants and augmentees with incomplete IPE/CWDE
   must carry a unit commander-signed letter stating the specific items not issued and why the
   equipment is not available. This letter does not constitute authority to simulate ATSO
   response. All ATSO participants will participate as fully as possible. Incomplete
   IPE/CWDE will be documented in the final report.
1.8. Exercise Actors. Requirements and reporting procedures for actors will be specified in the
LOIs. The number of actors will vary depending on the exercise scenarios.
 6                                                             354FWI90-201 21 AUGUST 2013


1.9. Reports. Reports will be published and disseminated once finalized. Ratings are an
assessment of the wing’s capability to accomplish the mission, to include transition to, and
conduct of, contingency operations in support of assigned taskings. Findings are validated
deficiencies and will be tracked until closed out.
     1.9.1. Ratings. Ratings are based on the five-tier rating system defined by PACAFSUP 90-
     201.
     1.9.2. Un-Rated Exercises. The 354 FW/IG may direct an exercise or certain elements of
     an exercise to not be rated. Additionally, real-world incidents may be substituted for exercise
     requirements IAW AFI 10-2501.
     1.9.3. Deficiencies. Deficiencies are based on the criteria listed in AFI 90-201, paragraph
     2.16. Procedures for replying to deficiencies will be addressed in the exercise report.
1.10. Best Practices. Procedures for validating “best practices” can be found in AFI 90-201,
paragraph 2.11 and PACAFSUP 90-201, paragraph 2.11.
1.11. Attrition. EET may remove players from the exercise for failure to comply with exercise
ground rules, whose action/inaction could have caused them to needlessly become a casualty, or
who display a gross “lack of sense of urgency.” Attrition personnel will report to the IGWC or
as directed by EET. 354 FW/IG will report all attrition incidents to the 354 FW/CC and Group
CC/WSA Chiefs at the conclusion of the exercise.
1.12. Exercise Observers. Any person who wishes to serve as an exercise observer must
submit a written request to the 354 FW/IG NLT seven days prior to a scheduled exercise.
Observers will be identified as such by wearing a badge stating “Observer” provided by the 354
FW/IGI. Observers will be included on the EET EAL, will not evaluate exercise events, and will
not interfere or participate in any exercise events.
1.13. Endex. 354 FW/CC, or designed representative, will declare ENDEX after consultation
with 354 FW/IG to ensure exercise objectives have been met.
354FWI90-201 21 AUGUST 2013                                                                      7

                                       SIMULATIONS

4.1. Definition. A simulation is a substitute action for a process required during an inspection
or exercise that cannot be performed due to safety, cost, needless inconvenience, or would be a
violation of law. The demonstration of a simulation should be designed to replicate the real
process as closely as possible and account for all resources necessary to perform the actual
process.
4.2. Simulation Policy. Units should make every attempt to react accordingly during the
exercise as during a real-world situation. Only simulations approved IAW this instruction may
be used.
4.3. Categories.
   4.3.1. PACAF Standard Simulations. PACAF standard simulations are developed by HQ
   PACAF and are applicable to all PACAF units. A list of PACAF standard simulations can
   be found at the PACAF IG SharePoint site: https://pacaf.eim.pacaf.af.mil/IG/default.aspx
   4.3.2. 354 FW Simulations. 354 FW approved simulations can be found on the 354th
   FW/IG            Exercises        and          Inspections         SharePoint    site:
   https://eielson.eim.elmendorf.af.mil/sites/exerciseinfodeliverables/default.aspx
   4.3.3. Temporary Simulations. Temporary simulations are used for one-time unique
   conditions or short-notice situations during a specific wing exercise or inspection.
   Temporary simulations are approved by the 354 FW/CV IAW with the paragraph
   below,automatically expire at ENDEX, and do not apply to higher headquarter exercises and
   inspections.
   4.3.4. Simulation Requests. All simulation requests must be submitted in writing using the
   format provided in Attachments 2 and 3.
       4.3.4.1. A separate request must be submitted for each simulation.
       4.3.4.2. Requests for 354 FW specific simulations will be forwarded to 354 FW/IG for
       coordination, and then to the 354 FW/CV for final approval.
       4.3.4.3. Temporary simulation requests must be submitted in accordance with the
       timelines designated in the exercise specific LOIs.
   4.3.5. Disapproved Simulation Requests. Units may re-submit simulation requests that
   have been disapproved with additional justification for further consideration.
354FWI90-201 21 AUGUST 2013                                                                  11


                                          Chapter 5

                      EXERCISE PLANNING AND EVALUATION

5.1. Objective. The primary objective of the EET is to provide the Wing Commander with an
independent assessment of wing readiness. Compliance with the standards outlined in the many
directives governing functional areas and the objective standards contained in the previous
chapters constitutes core guidelines for evaluation.
5.2. Unit Commander Role. All assigned and tenant organization commanders and WSA
Chiefs will appoint EET members. Commanders must ensure sufficient EET manning to cover a
24-hour exercise schedule, but should be careful to limit the number of EET members they
appoint. Commander/WSA Chief involvement is essential in exercise development and after-
action validation processes. Commanders and WSA chiefs shall refrain from undue command
influence on their EET that could mask deficiencies in unit training, processes, or equipment.
5.3. Trusted Agent. Trusted Agents will not divulge information to unauthorized personnel, to
include commanders and WSA chiefs. Trusted Agent information will not be sent via e-mail or
re-produced without the consent of 354 FW/IGI. Only 354 FW/IG are authorized to release
Trusted Agent information outside EET channels.
5.4. EET Appointment Procedures. 354 FW EET composition is IAW Table 5.1, and is the
minimum necessary to provide a comprehensive evaluation. Each Group, Squadron, and WSA
will designate a primary and alternate EET Lead for each organization. The EET Lead will serve
as the main POC for the group and subordinate squadrons. EET members shall not be dual-
tasked as players or responsible for other, non-EET duties during exercises.
   5.4.1. EET Requirements. Commanders and WSA Chiefs will appoint, in writing, highly
   qualified personnel in grades E-5/O-3 and above to the EET for all major functional areas.
   Individuals must be of high caliber, considered a subject matter expert, and should be chosen
   based on ability to evaluate with sound judgment while representing the Commander. Select
   individuals with a minimum of one-year retainability. Commanders/WSA chiefs will ensure
   their EET members attend training IAW paragraph 5.5
   5.4.2. EET members must have a current secret security clearance.
   5.4.3. Appoint EET members by letter to 354 FW/IGI, IAW the sample in Attachment 4.

NOTES:
1. The Readiness and Emergency Management Flight (CEX) and the Fire Protection Flight
(CEF) will provide mandatory representatives to the 354 Civil Engineer Squadron EET.

5.5. EET Training. 354 FW/IGI will maintain a roster of EET members, monitor training
requirements, and schedule initial and refresher EET training as appropriate.
   5.5.1. Initial Training. All newly-appointed EET are required to attend initial EET training
   prior to acting in the capacity as an evaluator. The Chief of Exercises and Inspections is
   responsible for providing initial training.
   5.5.2. Computer Based Training. Prior to evaluating wing/installation activities, exercise
   evaluation team (EET) members will complete the core training outlined in AFI 10-2501, Air
   Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations.
   5.5.3. Refresher Training. Refresher training is required every 20 months. Training will
   be provided by the Chief of Exercises and Inspections, but may be delegated to Group EET
   Leads.
   5.5.4. Ground Burst Simulator (GBS) Training. 354 FW/IGI will ensure a sufficient
   number of EET members are current and qualified in GBS training to support exercise
   requirements.
   5.5.5. Ancillary Training. All EET members must be trained in the specific areas they will
   be evaluating, for example: SABC, CBRN Defense, Incident Commander, UCC Operations,
   and Post Attack Response (PAR). See AFI 10-2501, tables 6.1. and 6.2. for a complete
   listing of all training requirements.
5.6. EET Identification. At a minimum all EET members will wear a distinctive, prominently
displayed EET badge issued by 354 FW/IGI. EET members should also wear the distinctive
EET vest.
354FWI90-201 21 AUGUST 2013                                                                  13


5.7. Exercise Planning. 354 FW/IGI is the OPR for 354 FW exercise planning.
   5.7.1. Meetings. 354 FW/IGI will schedule exercise planning meetings and invite
   appropriate EET members. Attendance is mandatory. Absences must be coordinated
   through EET Group/Squadron/WSA leads. Alternates must be EET-qualified.
   5.7.2. Develop Exercise Objectives. Commanders will establish exercise objectives and
   focus areas with their respective EET members. This allows unit EET members to develop
   scenarios that test their unit’s ability to meet mission requirements and provide feedback to
   the commander.
   5.7.3. Exercise Schedule of Events (ESOE). 354 FW/IGI will oversee creation of an
   ESOE that consolidates Wing Commander guidance, primary exercise objectives, team chief
   inputs, unit inputs, open findings and MAJCOM SIIs. The ESOE will be logical, coherent,
   and permit EET members to be on scene to evaluate all events. The 354 FW/IGI will
   schedule an ESOE review meeting with EET members prior to STARTEX. The 354 FW/IG
   has final authority over the ESOE.
   5.7.4. Letters of Instruction (LOIs). 354 FW/IGI will maintain, update, and publish
   current exercise LOIs prior to each exercise.
   5.7.5. Ground Burst Simulator (GBS)/Smoke Grenades. All requests for GBS/smoke
   grenades to support exercise events will be submitted to the 354 FW/IGI. 354 FW/IGI will
   request and store all GBS/smoke grenades IAW all applicable HQAF, HQPACAF, and local
   guidance.
   5.7.6. Exercise Support. All required exercise inject cards and props will be prepared prior
   to STARTEX. Actor requirements will be identified in the LOIs. 354 FW/IGI will schedule
   actors for 12 hour shifts based on inject requirements.
       5.7.6.1. EET leads will ensure their respective EET members have all necessary support.
       5.7.6.2. 354 MDG EET lead will provide support for moulage events.
5.8. Exercise Duty Location. EET members are assigned to the 354 FW/IG beginning one
week prior to STARTEX through the first complete draft of the exercise report and out brief.
After ENDEX, EET Leads may release their team members when no longer needed to draft or
validate the exercise out brief or final report. EET duty location during an exercise is the IG
Work Center (IGWC) located in Building 3112 behind Amber Hall.
5.9. EET Mobility Processing Exemption. EET members filling mobility position numbers
(MPN) are exempt from mobility processing during local exercises only. Units may simulate
processing EET members by sending their mobility folders through the processing line. Each
folder must include a copy of the individual’s EET appointment letter. Commanders should use
non-MPN personnel for EET duties, if at all possible.
5.10. Subjective Grading Guidelines. Some of the graded areas in an exercise are subjective,
or do not have a specific "approved" procedure. EET will base ratings on mission
accomplishment and EET members’ “experience and judgment.”
5.11. Installation Eet Team Chief (354 FW/IG) Responsibilities.
   5.11.1. Planning. Conduct exercise planning IAW paragraph 5.7
 14                                                         354FWI90-201 21 AUGUST 2013


   5.11.2. Management. EET team chief, group leads, and squadron leads will exercise
   general supervisor responsibility for the EET members and will schedule them to ensure
   adequate functional area expertise is available to cover all ESOE events.
   5.11.3. Validation. EET team chief, group leads, and squadron leads will ensure EET
   inputs are thoroughly validated and promptly provided to 354 FW/IGI. The team chief,
   group leads, and squadron leads will review all report inputs for their functional area to
   include all observations, AFIs, findings, and outstanding performers. Use the standard input
   forms provided by 354 FW/IGI.
   5.11.4. Report Writing. The EET team chief will set a 1-week suspense to collect inputs
   from EET leads and will draft the final report. The written report is normally completed
   two weeks after the end of the exercise. EET team leads will be released from the exercise
   duties by the 354 FW/IG after the out brief is complete and they have validated the inputs
   and draft report.
5.12. Group and Squadron EET Lead Responsibilities
   5.12.1. Group Leads will:
      5.12.1.1. Serve as the single point of contact between the 354 FW/IGI and the group’s
