                                             Chapter 1

                                      GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. General Guidance. This instruction governs the performance of USAF aviation support
for military or public events held for community relations or ceremonial purposes. It details the
procedures for event and participation approval and specifies the operational limitations of the
aviation support rendered. Air Force aerial events keep the public and military informed of U.S.
preparedness, demonstrate modern weapons systems, promote good community and international
relations, support Air Force recruiting and retention efforts and render military honors. For
additional guidance on Air Force participation in public events and community relations
programs, see AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures. For additional guidance on
Air Force flyovers supporting funeral or memorial events, see AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs
Program. HQ USAF/A3O may task MAJCOMs to provide assets to participate in certain key
public or military events.
1.1. (AFGSC) General Guidance. AFI 35-101, Public Affairs and Policies and Procedures
has changed to AFI 35-105, Community Relations.
1.2. Public Event. Public events are community relations events not connected with the
military functioning of the Department of Defense and intended primarily for non-military
audiences. Some examples include military Open House events, ceremonies, exhibitions,
expositions, athletic contests, parades, tattoos, fairs, airshows, international airshow and trade
exhibitions, or similar programs. These events may be on- or off-base; continental United States
(CONUS) or outside of the continental United States (OCONUS). Public events can be
sponsored by either DoD or non-DoD organizations. Such events can be good community
relations and recruiting opportunities. Military exercises, movements, maneuvers, or operations
are not considered public events merely on the basis of being incidentally observed by the
general public.
1.3. Military Event. A military event is an official DoD event, sponsored by the DoD, a DoD
Component, or a command conducted in support of an assigned mission, including purposes of
esprit de corps, primarily for military personnel, civil service personnel, dependents, and limited
guests. The event must be hosted on a facility owned, leased or operated by the DoD. In the
event a judgment needs to be made on whether an event is a military or public event, contact
SAF/PAN who will assist in the determination.
1.4. Aviation support (For Public and Military Events). Aviation support for public and
military events include static displays, flyovers, aerial reviews, and aerial demonstrations – these
activities are also referred to as aerial events.
     1.4.1. Static Display. Static display, a subset of aviation support, is the ground display of
     military aircraft and related equipment not involving taxiing or starting of engines while
     spectators are in the display area.
     1.4.2. Flyover. Flyover, a subset of aviation support, is a straight and level flight by a single
     military aircraft or by a formation of four or fewer military aircraft of the same type (see
     Attachment 1 for definition of type) from the same Military Service over a predetermined
     point on the ground at a specific time and not involving aerobatics or demonstrations;
AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012                                                            7


  however, bank angles of up to 90 degrees are permissible and may be used if required to
  improve the visibility of the aircraft to the spectators. A single event will be supported with a
  single flyover only (IAW DoDD 5410.18)—this restriction does not apply to public airshows
  or to military open house events. For multiple flyovers and multiple passes, see Attachment
  1. Flyovers of public events in support of community relations activities may only be flown
  as adjuncts to approved training missions.
     1.4.2.1. An approved funeral or memorial service may be supported with the missing
     man formation (see paragraph 3.6.2.4 and 4.2.3).
     1.4.2.2. Dissimilar Formation Flyover. A dissimilar formation is a single-element
     formation of four or fewer aircraft of multiple Mission Design Series (MDS) of the same
     type (see Attachment 1 for definition of type) from the same Military Service. A
     dissimilar formation flyover is not to be confused with an aerial review. An example of a
     dissimilar formation would be a two-, three-, or four-ship formation involving F-16s and
     F-15s. Formations involving variants of an MDS, for example a formation of F-16A, F-
     16C, F-16D fighters, is not considered dissimilar. A dissimilar formation flyover should
     be undertaken only with applicable consideration given to safety, to the compatible flying
     characteristics of the aircraft involved, and to the overall theme of the event that is being
     supported.
     1.4.2.3. (Added-AFGSC) Standard flyover requests will be for a single, straight and
     level pass. EXCEPTION: Units may request up to three passes for airshows/open houses.
     Do not perform aerobatics or capabilities demonstrations unless specifically approved by
     HQ AFGSC/A3 or higher. Repositioning maneuvers between passes will be normal
     traffic pattern procedures, not to include a closed pattern maneuver.
     1.4.2.4. (Added-AFGSC) Units will request Profiles 1 thru 6 for airshows and open
     houses and either Profile 1 (clean, traffic pattern speed) or Profile 2 (high speed pass) for
     all other flyovers IAW Attachment 4. The WG/CC (may be delegated no lower than the
     OG/CC) will determine the profile(s) to be flown at a particular event based on runway
     environment, crowd orientation, and showcasing the aircraft’s visual signature.
     1.4.2.5. (Added-AFGSC) Requests for T-38s and UH-1Ns may include up to a four-
     ship flyover. All B-2 and B-52 aircraft will fly single-ship flyovers. Tactical formations
     are not authorized except for capabilities/rescue demonstrations. Formation flights will be
     flown IAW AFI 11-2MDSV3, MDS--Operations Procedures.
     1.4.2.6. (Added-AFGSC) Refer to Appendix 6 of this supplement and AFI 11-246V6,
     Air Force Aircraft Demonstrations (C-17, C-130, C-141, C/KC/NKC-135, UH-1), for
     standard profiles and associated altitudes. Under no circumstances will altitude
     restrictions listed in AFI 11-2H-1V3, H-1 Helicopter Operations Procedures, and
     MAJCOM supplements be violated. Requests for non-standard profiles will include
     proposed altitudes.
  1.4.3. Aerial Review. Aerial review, a subset of aviation support, is a flyover of more than
  four aircraft, or of multiple types (see Attachment 1 for definition) of aircraft, or of aircraft
  representing more than one Military Service or Nation, regardless of horizontal and timing
  separation of flying elements. It may have elements in trail formation and will not involve
 8                                             AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012


     precision maneuvers or demonstrations. The elements of the aerial review may be individual
     aircraft, formations, or a combination of individual aircraft and formations.
        1.4.3.1. Aerial reviews are reserved only for the most meaningful national or
        international occasions and shall not be performed at CONUS public events without
        approval by OASD/PA. OCONUS approval will comply with COCOM directives.
        1.4.3.2. Multiple Aerial Events Supporting a Single Public Event. From the public affairs
        perspective an aerial review flown for a given event constitutes a significant AF
        statement of support; so too does performing multiple aerial events in combination for a
        single public event. To ensure an appropriate level of scrutiny and approval, the
        performing of multiple aerial events (for example, multiple flyovers) in combination for a
        single public event requires event and participation approval levels comparable to aerial
        review approval levels. This criterion applies to the following:
            1.4.3.2.1. Multiple flyovers at the same event, regardless of timing separation
            between the flyover aircraft or formations.
            1.4.3.2.2. The combination of an Air Force Parachute Team (AFPT) airdrop and a
            flyover at a single event.

NOTE: As distinctly diverse assets, this combination will not be performed at public events
without approval by SAF/PAN and HQ USAF/A3O.
        1.4.3.3. The definition of aerial review does not apply to the Air Force vintage aircraft
        program (Heritage/Texan Flights), unless flown in conjunction with other assets outside
        of the vintage aircraft program.
     1.4.4. Aerial Demonstrations. Aerial demonstration, a subset of aviation support, includes
     virtually every type of aerial participation by fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft in public or
     military events (except aerial review and flyover). See Attachment 1 for a list of example
     activities that meet the definition of Aerial Demonstrations. Aerial demonstration is
     synonymous with the phrases aerial demo, aircraft demonstration (demo), aircraft capabilities
     demonstration (demo), and aircraft capabilities exercise (CAPEX). The AFI 11-246, Air
     Force Aircraft Demonstrations, series specify policy for aerial demonstrations (to include
     demonstration teams), demonstration profiles for certain aircraft and the procedures for non-
     standard profile approval. Training events incidentally observed by the general public are not
     considered to be aerial demonstrations. See paragraphs 3.6.4 and 4.4 for specific procedures
     on aerial demonstration approval.

NOTE: Guidance in paragraphs 1.4.1 through 1.4.4 is not intended to limit aviation support at
public airshows or military Open House events – these events may be supported with multiple
static displays, multiple flyovers (with multiple passes) and multiple aerial demonstrations, all
approved IAW the normal procedures in this instruction for event and participation approval.
Additionally, multiple aerial events supporting two or more separate events at a single
geographic location in a single day can be authorized IAW the normal procedures in this
instruction (for example: a flyover for a USAFA graduation ceremony and a funeral flyover at
the USAFA cemetery, both at approximately the same time). Each event must stand on its own,
and be completely independent (limitations specified in paragraph 1.4.2 apply to each separate
event).
AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012                                                              9


1.5. Approvals. Aviation support at public and military events requires both a determination of
event approval from Public Affairs and participation approval from Operations. This instruction
outlines the required levels of approval (event and participation) for aerial events at public or
military events. For some events, eligibility has been predetermined by Public Affairs and
requires only Operations participation approval; see Chapter 3 for specific event approval
requirements and Chapter 4 for specific participation approval requirements. USAF aviation
support not described in this instruction but planned for a public or military event must receive
MAJCOM, HQ USAF/A3O, and SAF/PA approval before the performance. For events outside
of the United States, Canada and Mexico, approval will comply with COCOM directives and
paragraphs 5.9 through 5.10.
   1.5.1. (Added-AFGSC) Approval authority for aerial events is IAW Attachment 2, as
   supplemented. When the aerial event requires multi-command or multi-service approval,
   submit the request through the appropriate MAJCOM chain of command for MAJCOM
   approval before submitting to HQ AFGSC.
       1.5.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Refer to Attachment 4 when submitting a request for
       participation in a flyover. The WG/CC (or designated representative) must approve all
       requests before forwarding to HQ AFGSC. The 509 BW manages the aerial event
       schedule for the B-2 in close coordination with HQ AFGSC/A3BA.
1.6. Operational Criteria. Safety must be the prime consideration at all times. Do not engage
in activities that compromise the safety of spectators or that could damage or destroy property.
Participation by any air refueling aircraft in a flyover or aerial review shall not be conducted with
the receiver closer than the precontact position.

NOTE: The Thunderbirds Demonstration Team, MAJCOM Single Ship Demonstration Teams,
aviation record setting flights, and USAF vintage aircraft programs (such as the Heritage Flight
Texan Flight programs) will use operational criteria provided in their own approved Air Force or
MAJCOM instructions; all other Air Force aircraft participating in aerial events will use the
criteria presented in this paragraph.
1.6. (AFGSC) Operational Criteria. Procedures contained in this supplement represent the
minimum acceptable safety procedures that should be observed. No set of procedures can
anticipate all situations which may be encountered; hence, no standard will ever exist which can
substitute for common sense, sound judgment, and a continuing concern for safety. Ensure that
all fly-by, airshow and aerial demonstration aircrews have reviewed all regulations/instructions
applicable to tasked events. Further it is important that they completely understand the basis for
these restrictions, many of which have been written after the loss of fellow aviators or aircraft.
Responsibility for this personal oversight is a leadership task that can be delegated no lower than
the Operations Group Commander level. Aircrews will review Attachment 8 checklist and
briefing guide, where applicable, before all formation flyovers.
NOTE: AFGSC does not have an approved Heritage Flight program.
   1.6.1. Showmanship and Professionalism. Aerial events have many objectives among which
   are to entertain the spectators and to inform the general public on Air Force capabilities. In
   planning and performing aerial events, supervisors, pilots, aircrew members and all other
   participants should remember the objective is to demonstrate Air Force professionalism and
   competence to the general public. Strict compliance with show lines, flying procedures, and
10                                           AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012


  minimum altitude restrictions reflect a high degree of professionalism and contribute
  markedly to great showmanship.
  1.6.2. Weather Minimums. Weather must allow operations under Visual Flight Rules (VFR)
  in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules, and applicable AFI 11-
  2MDS, Volume 3, MDS Specific Operations Procedures. Weather minimums are ―flyover
  minimum altitude‖ plus 500 feet and 3 miles visibility. The MAJCOM or mission
  commander may set higher minimums based on the nature of the event, local terrain, or other
  factors.
     1.6.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) If weather is less than 2500/5, limit all activity to a single
     straight and level pass, (1000/3 for the UH-1N). See paragraphs 1.6.2.2 through 1.6.2.4
     and 1.6.3.1.3 for additional restrictions.
     1.6.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) For a flyover not under positive radar control, the weather
     ceiling must be a minimum of 2500 feet AGL with visibility of 5 statute miles in the
     viewing area. For a flyover of two or fewer aircraft under positive radar control, the
     weather ceiling must be a minimum of 1500 feet AGL with visibility of 3 statute miles.
     HQ AFGSC/A3 may grant waivers to a minimum of 1500 feet AGL and 3 miles visibility
     on a case-by-case basis. The minimum weather for helicopters is a ceiling of 1000 feet
     AGL and 3 statute miles visibility.
     1.6.2.3. (Added-AFGSC) Weather minimum for launch of aircraft participating in an
     aerial event must be IAW AFI 11-202V3, unless the mission commander specifies higher
     minimums.
     1.6.2.4. (Added-AFGSC) Holding, if required prior to the event, can be conducted in
     IMC conditions. Aircraft holding as multiple separate flights must be able to join in VMC
     conditions and must remain VMC after joining. UH-1N aircraft will hold single ship in
     IMC conditions, and can rejoin in VMC conditions to perform a multi ship flyover.
  1.6.3. Altitude Minimums. The minimum altitudes published in AFI 11-202 and in Federal
  Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations for congested and non-congested areas apply. If
  the venue for an event is on a riverbank with a show line or flyover ground track over water
  or over the opposite bank, treat this location for a flyover as a congested area since spectators
  can congregate on both sides of the river. If the venue for an event is on the shore of the
  ocean, large bay, or large lake with a show line or flyover ground track over the open water,
  treat this location for a flyover as a non-congested area.
     1.6.3.1. USAF Minimum Altitudes. In certain cases, such as demonstration team
     performances, approved maneuver packages, and entry and exit into flyover areas, the
     FAA may specifically waive the altitude requirements below. Even if the FAA authorizes
     a lower altitude, USAF controlled aircraft must not be flown lower than the following
     minimum altitudes:
         1.6.3.1.1. 500 feet AGL for fixed-wing aircraft.
         1.6.3.1.2. MAJCOMs are authorized to establish altitudes lower than the minimums
         specified in paragraph 1.6.3.1.1 for operating rotary wing aircraft in the execution of
         approved aircraft demonstration profiles, when the lower altitudes are necessary to
AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012                                                           11


         properly demonstrate capabilities. Each MAJCOM sets minimum altitudes for the
         safe operation of their assets.
         1.6.3.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) The minimum altitude for participation in all aerial
         events is 500 feet AGL. (Units will ensure FAA waivers have been obtained). For
         non-airshow/open house events, bomber aircraft are limited to 1000 feet above the
         highest obstacle within 2000 feet. For airshow/open house events, all AFGSC fixed
         wing MDSs are limited to 500 feet above the highest obstacle within 2000 feet. UH-
         1N’s will fly no lower than 500 feet AGL for both airshow/open house events, and
         non-airshow/open house events. For aerial demonstrations such as tactical security
         force inserts, UH-1N aircraft will fly no lower than 150 feet AGL and will at no time
         fly toward or over the viewing area (these events are restricted to airshow/open house
         events. For aerial demonstrations see Attachment 7.
  1.6.4. Airspeed Limitations. Airspeed guidance in AFI 11-202, Volume 3 applies to all aerial
  events. The minimum airspeed for the operation of any fixed wing AF aircraft participating
  in any military or civilian event is stall speed plus 30 percent for the aircraft configuration.
  Airlift aircraft used in demonstrating standard, approved tactical procedures such as assault
  takeoffs or assault landings, may be flown at lower airspeeds, but not at airspeeds lower than
  specified in technical order publications. Maximum airspeed is limited to .90 MACH, or a
  lower airspeed if stipulated in a governing FAA waiver, for all aerial demonstrations except
  for approved record flights and demonstration teams. Demonstration teams will use a
  maximum speed of .95 MACH. FAA waiver may be required for airspeeds above 250kts
  below 10,000 MSL.
     1.6.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) Flyovers, aerial reviews, capabilities demonstrations, and
     rescue demonstrations must be flown using appropriate AFI 11-2MDSV3, MDS--
     Operations Procedures.
     1.6.4.2. (Added-AFGSC) For aerial reviews, capabilities demonstrations, and rescue
     demonstrations, if aircraft airspeeds are incompatible, other means of deconflicting and
     synchronizing aircraft, such as altitude, timing, or flight path separation, must be utilized.
  1.6.5. Time Limitations. Due to safety concerns and reduced public relations benefit, aerial
  events are authorized only between the beginning of Morning Civil Twilight and the end of
  Evening Civil Twilight. The USAF Academy Wings of Blue parachute team is authorized an
  exception to this policy provided a FAA waiver (FAA Form 7711-2, Certificate of Waiver
  or Authorization Application) is obtained for each night jump in accordance with 14 Code
  of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 105.21.
     1.6.5.1. (Added-AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3 approval is required and may be granted on a
     case-by-case basis for any aerial event which begins, ends or takes place during morning
     or evening civil twilight (the 30 minutes between start and end of civil twilight).
  1.6.6. Communications. Aerial Control Teams (ACT) and on-site ground supervisors should
  use discrete radio frequencies to control aviation assets.
  1.6.7. Spectator Area. The event organizer for aerial demonstrations must set up a designated
  spectator area safely separated from the area over which the aerial demonstrations will
  occur—safety is always a primary consideration in selecting the spectator area and in
  establishing the show line for flight operations. Official observers and spectators must stay
12                                          AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012


  within their designated area. Aircraft conducting demonstrations at military or civilian events
  will not over-fly the designated spectator area unless specifically granted a waiver by FAA
  and the parent MAJCOM. The event organizer must ensure a 1,500-foot minimum distance
  exists between the spectator area and the show line for all military aircraft demonstrations.
  Under the following circumstances, the 1,500-foot minimum distance can be reduced to the
  following:
     1.6.7.1. To 1,200 feet between the spectator area and the show line if the FAA grants
     such a waiver and if the parent MAJCOM approves.
     1.6.7.2. To 1,000 feet between the spectator area and the show line for T-6 Texan II
     demonstrations.
     1.6.7.3. To 1,000 feet between the spectator area and the intended airdrop impact point
     or the drop zone boundary (whichever is greater) for the following tactical airdrop
     demonstrations:
         1.6.7.3.1. Equipment
         1.6.7.3.2. Container Delivery System
         1.6.7.3.3. Personnel using round canopies
     1.6.7.4. To 500 feet between the spectator area and the show line for a helicopter
     operational demonstration and for fixed-wing assault landing or assault takeoff
     demonstrations.
     1.6.7.5. To 500 feet between the spectator area and the show line for USAF vintage
     aircraft programs.
     1.6.7.6. To 500 feet between the spectator area and the show line for glider aerial
     demonstrations; notwithstanding, only 200 feet is required between spectators and glider
     aircraft during takeoff and 75 feet during landing.
     1.6.7.7. To 50 feet between the spectator area and the landing target for the airdrop of
     precision parachute demonstration teams (for example, the Wings of Blue) when
     steerable square main and reserve canopies are used. The airdrop may include a High
     Altitude Low Opening (HALO) demonstration.
  1.6.8. (Added-AFGSC) The following guidelines will be followed by AFGSC aircrews
  when conducting flyovers with pyrotechnic demonstrations.
     1.6.8.1. (Added-AFGSC) For events held on military installations, the senior Explosive
     Ordnance Disposal (EOD) person present is designated as the Range Safety Officer
     (RSO). For events not held on a military installation, there will only be specific personnel
     permitted to utilize pyrotechnics during AFGSC aircraft demonstrations. The
     International Council of Airshows (ICAS) Pyro Safety Task Force will identify personnel
     to be approved AFGSC Shooters in Charge (SICs) each year based on experience,
     judgment, and safety record. To be an approved SIC, the individual must meet the
     requirements contained in the ICAS Guide-lines for use of Pyrotechnics and Special
     Effects at Airshows, and concurrence of AFGSC/A3B. For civilian pyrotechnic support,
     the SIC is the equivalent of the RSO and must follow established ICAS pyrotechnics
     guidelines. Only those AFGSC SICs chosen by the ICAS Safety Committee will be
AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012                                                         13


     allowed to work with AFGSC aircraft. The RSO/SIC will ensure a thorough safety
     briefing is conducted prior to operation setup. Personnel should be informed of how to
     conduct procedures in the event of an emergency.
     1.6.8.2. (Added-AFGSC) Operations will not be permitted when lightning is within 10
     nautical miles.
     1.6.8.3. (Added-AFGSC) Aircraft Flyovers. All participating aircrews will be briefed
     on the pyro plan and the following will apply:
        1.6.8.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) Aircraft will fly no lower than 500 feet AGL for
        pyrotechnic passes. The flight path will be offset a minimum of 200 feet from the
        pyrotechnic site and away from the spectator area. The pyrotechnic site should be
        situated so the aircrew can reference and overfly the runway with the 200 feet pyro
        offset and maintain the 1250 feet Inhabited Building Distance (IBD) clearance.
        1.6.8.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) A minimum interval following aircraft passage will be
        utilized to provide a minimum of 750 feet aircraft clearance before manual detonation
        of any pyrotechnics. This will be aircraft speed dependent. The following intervals
        will provide this safety clearance: 100 knots (kts) - 4.5 seconds, 200 kts - 3 seconds,
        300 kts - 2 seconds, 400 kts - 1.5 seconds, greater than or equal to 500 kts - 1 second.
        NOTE: A knot is 1 nautical mile per hour.
            1.6.8.3.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) WARNING: Nothing will be placed on top of,
            over, or near any explosive that might present a debris hazard to aircraft in flight.
            1.6.8.3.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) WARNING: Only non-fragmenting material will
            be used with the pyrotechnics demonstration. Detonation will not cause any debris
            to climb higher than 100 feet AGL, other than smoke, which will usually rise with
            the heat and drift with the wind.
     1.6.8.4. (Added-AFGSC) If pyrotechnics are to be utilized, the show site must provide
     the name and contact number of the RSO/SIC to the participating AFGSC aircrew prior
     to their arrival.
     1.6.8.5. (Added-AFGSC) An aircrew member of each participating AFGSC aircraft
     will review the following items, preferably in person, for on-station flyovers, but as a
     minimum by phone or confirmed e-mail, prior to each aerial event:
        1.6.8.5.1. (Added-AFGSC) Dimensions of the pyrotechnics area and the magnitude
        of explosives being used.
        1.6.8.5.2. (Added-AFGSC) Aircraft/pyro de-confliction plan. The altitude, offset,
        and timing de-confliction from 1.6.8.3.1 and 1.6.8.3.2 will be employed. The
        RSO/SIC will not fire the pyrotechnics until the aircraft has passed safely beyond or
        pulled off the target and the appropriate timing interval has passed.
        1.6.8.5.3. (Added-AFGSC) Flyover profile and sequence of pyro.
        1.6.8.5.4. (Added-AFGSC) Forecast wind and effects on pyro.
        1.6.8.5.5. (Added-AFGSC) Communications plan.
        1.6.8.5.6. (Added-AFGSC) Knock-it-off (KIO) procedures.
 14                                          AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012


           1.6.8.5.7. (Added-AFGSC) Fire hazards and fire department response plan.
           1.6.8.5.8. (Added-AFGSC) FOD potential and effects.
       1.6.8.6. (Added-AFGSC) Safety is paramount. If at any time safety becomes an issue,
       anyone on the radio may make a KIO call. Following a KIO call, the pilot and RSO/SIC
       will acknowledge the call. In addition, the pilot will discontinue the flyover and reset the
       aircraft to a pre-determined safe area or holding position. If there is ever a question of
       timing, safety, or sequence, the RSO/SIC will not shoot the pyro.
1.7. Compliance with Flight Procedures. For aircraft operations outside the United States,
comply with host nation air rules and procedures and with the USAF Foreign Clearance Guide.
Coordinate with host nation Air Traffic Control representatives before an over flight of a foreign
country. For air operations in the United States, comply with all FAA rules and instructions.
1.8. Waiver Process. For situations that require waivers to FAA regulations and AF
instructions, obtain the FAA waiver before staffing the AF waiver request. Obtain the FAA
waiver and determinations on FAA policy through the local Flight Standards District Office.
1.9. Force Protection. The safety of Air Force personnel and the protection of Air Force
aircraft and equipment are paramount. Force protection measures should always be taken into
consideration, whether participating in flyovers, aerial demonstrations, and aerial reviews, or
conducting static displays. It is imperative that all Air Force members at all levels become
situationally aware of potential threats to Air Force personnel and equipment when deciding to
participate in any military or civilian event. Refer to AFMAN 31-201, Volume 3, Flight
Operations; AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program; and AFI 10-1004,
Conducting Air Force Open Houses (when published) for force protection considerations – this
must be reviewed for applicability prior to planning a base open house.
1.10. Other Guidance. For comprehensive guidance on Air Force participation in military and
civilian events, community relations programs, and commercial activities such as air and trade
shows, see AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures; AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs
Program; DoD Directive 5410.18, Community Relations; DoD Instruction 5410.19, Public
Affairs Community Relations Policy Implementation; DoD Directive 7230.8, Leases and
Demonstrations of DoD Equipment; and the other publications listed in Attachment 1. For
additional information, contact HQ USAF/A3OO at DSN 227-5019 or SAF/PAN at DSN 225-
9664.

                                       RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Secretary of the Air Force, International Affairs (SAF/IA). International events for
which aviation support is requested or tasked must be evaluated to ensure political, military and
industry concerns are taken into consideration. This responsibility rests with SAF/IA.
Additionally, SAF/IA coordinates with Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (USD(P)),
Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), HQ USAF/A3O and MAJCOMS for
International Airshows and Trade Exhibitions as outlined in paragraph 5.10 For international
events that are outlined in paragraph 5.9 (public affairs activities), SAF/IA coordination may be
required if there is a significant political, military or industry concern. This coordination does not
preempt or diminish the combatant commander’s authority to exercise event and participation
approval over events falling within their respective Areas of Responsibility (AOR).
2.2. Secretary of the Air Force, Public Affairs (SAF/PA). Public events for which Air Force
aviation support is requested must be evaluated to ensure their legitimacy, suitability and
appropriateness for Air Force association, involvement or participation. This responsibility rests
with SAF/PA when the venues for such events fall within the United States, Canada or Mexico.
SECAF has delegated to SAF/PA the authority to approve exceptions to flyover policy, with HQ
USAF/A3O coordination and concurrence. SAF/PA is also responsible for coordination with
OASD/PA and interface with requestors.
2.3. HQ USAF Director of Current Operations and Training (HQ USAF/A3O)
Responsibilities.
   2.3.1. Waiver Requests. HQ USAF/A3O is the approval authority for waiver requests to this
   instruction, unless otherwise stated.
   2.3.2. Unique Requests. HQ USAF/A3O is the approval authority for requests not covered
   by this instruction. Submit such requests to HQ USAF/A3OO for evaluation and approval,
   after obtaining MAJCOM approval. MAJCOMs will submit requests at least 45 calendar
   days before the event.
   2.3.3. Funeral Flyovers. In unique cases when a funeral flyover is authorized (IAW

     will provide a fund cite for unit aircrew and the minimum ground support personnel
     required to support the event. Units should contact event organizers to determine the level
     of support the host will provide and advise HQ AFGSC/A3BA of any additional
     requirements. If needed, units will use normal procedures to obtain tanker support and
     notify HQ AFGSC/A3BA if further assistance is required.
     2.4.4.2. (Added-AFGSC) Units volunteering to participate in aerial events are
     responsible for funding all associated costs.

   2.4.7. Ensures a planned flyover profile is tailored to the specific event site. The unit
   commander or a designated representative must review and approve these profiles. The
   approving authority must ensure compliance with applicable Air Force policy directives and
   instructions, aircraft specific training manuals, MAJCOM supplements, and all FAA/Host
   Nation rules and regulations. Deviations from approved flight profiles are not authorized
   except for safety of flight.
   2.4.8. Ensures aircraft and equipment placed on static display are made safe according to
   Attachment 3 and MAJCOM guidance.
       2.4.8.1. (Added-AFGSC) See Attachment 3 as supplemented                      for   minimum
       precautions required for aircraft placed on static display.
       2.4.8.2. (Added-AFGSC) Stands or platforms utilized to view static display aircraft will
       meet the requirements of Air Force Occupational Safety and Health Standard
       (AFOSHSTD) 91-501, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Standard; AFMAN
       91-201, Explosive Safety Standards; and AFGSC supplements thereto, to ensure
       personnel viewing static display aircraft are afforded optimum protection from injury.
   2.4.9. Coordinates all planned participation in military or public events with the FAA
   through the regional Air Force representative (or host nation equivalent). This can be
   delegated to the participating unit. Coordination is not required if participation consists only
   of static display support.
   2.4.10. Provides an Aerial Control Team (ACT) as directed in MAJCOM supplement to this
   instruction and in the following cases:
       2.4.10.1. Events requiring precise timing.
       2.4.10.2. High visibility events (i.e., the Super Bowl).
       2.4.10.3. Aerial Reviews.
       2.4.10.4. Directed by HQ USAF/A3O.

   2.4.12. Requests waivers to this instruction.
   2.4.13. MAJCOMs may delegate duties, responsibilities and approval levels within their
   supplement to this instruction, unless specifically prohibited by this instruction.
2.5. Mission Commander. In general, the mission commander is the on-scene commander
responsible for the overall safety and conduct of the mission and makes the "go" or "no-go"
decision. A mission commander is required for flyovers, aerial reviews, and aerial
demonstrations. The mission commander, or deputy, must be highly qualified, having a thorough
understanding of the aerial event being undertaken. The mission commander’s responsibilities
include, but are not limited to, flyover safety, weather considerations, timing, sequencing, and
airspace and range clearances. The mission commander should be able to directly communicate
with the pilot or aircraft commander or should be able to relay information to the pilot or aircraft
 18                                             AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012


commander. In some cases, the senior member of the ACT is designated as the mission
commander. In the event the senior member of the ACT is not the mission commander, then the
mission commander may be one of the following:
   2.5.1. The aircraft commander on a fixed-wing aircraft/helicopter having an aircrew.
   2.5.2. The pilot in a single-seat fighter or trainer aircraft.
   2.5.3. Flight lead for a fighter/trainer formation.
   2.5.4. Ground-based military officer acting as an air boss for an airshow or other ceremony.
   2.5.5. Senior enlisted military member working in the tower.
   2.5.6. DoD-civilian Airspace Manager with ATC Tower or Rated Pilot experience working
   in the control tower.
   2.5.7. (Added-AFGSC) GO/NO-GO/AIR ABORT Decisions. Although a Ground Liaison
   Officer (GLO)/ACT should be provided for most aerial events, the ultimate responsibility for
   the GO/NO-GO/AIR ABORT decision rests with the flight lead/aircraft commander.
   2.5.8. (Added-AFGSC) Based on the event tasking, location of the event, and composition
   of the aircraft formation, the event-approval authority will make the determination if a
   ground mission commander is required. If a ground mission commander is not required, the
   flight lead assumes responsibilities for aircraft/flight participation in an aerial event. A
   mission commander will:
       2.5.8.1. (Added-AFGSC) Supervise the planning, coordination, briefing, and control.
       2.5.8.2. (Added-AFGSC) Provide a project officer to serve as a focal point for aerial
       review planning, briefing, and coordination.
       2.5.8.3. (Added-AFGSC) Provide the ACT (if required by AFI 11-209, paragraph 2.6),
       unless provided by HQ ACC in the Washington DC National Capital Region (NCR).
       Coordinate with participating commands, FAA, and event sponsors, as necessary, to
       arrange the event.
       2.5.8.4. (Added-AFGSC) Ensure sufficient resources are available to support the
       requirement.
       2.5.8.5. (Added-AFGSC) Prepare and distribute Special Instructions (SPINS) or
       tasking message(s), as required.
       2.5.8.6. (Added-AFGSC) Select a staging base, if required, and notify the proposed
       staging base commander as early as possible of requirements for logistic support.
2.6. Aerial Control Team (ACT) Responsibilities. An ACT is a highly experienced individual
or team of individuals organized and established to control Air Force participation in military
and public events. Each MAJCOM will establish qualifications for ACT members. Employing an
ACT is appropriate when Air Force participation includes large numbers of aircraft or aircraft
from more than one MAJCOM or Service. For events within the NCR, coordination for ACT
support must be made through ACC/A3OA, DSN 574-7854, not later than (NLT) 7 duty days
prior to the event. For flyovers occurring at Arlington National Cemetery, coordination will
occur as soon as possible. The ACT is responsible for the following:
AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012                                                          19


   2.6.1. Planning Air Force participation and coordinating details with participating
   commands, commanders, participants, and the FAA.
   2.6.2. Briefing commanders and participants on all aspects of participation to include, at a
   minimum, flight profiles, airspeeds, altitudes, holding patterns, communication frequencies,
   air traffic control coverage, area traffic density, area hazards, weather minimums, alternate
   weather procedures, and other relevant operational considerations.
   2.6.3. Controlling the flow and movement of all participating aircraft. ACTs will use discrete
   radio frequencies when possible.
   2.6.4. Serving as the on-scene advisor to the mission commander, or as the mission
   commander if requested by the MAJCOM.
2.7. (Added-AFGSC) Aerial Events Involving Air Force Assets in the Washington DC
NCR. IAW the current AFI11-209 ACC Sup and the Memorandum of Agreement for Aerial
Events in the NCR, HQ ACC/A3 will provide the Ground Mission Commander and ACT
support. Support includes the planning, inter-agency coordination, flight procedural briefings,
and final control of executing aircraft, regardless of owning MAJCOM. HQ ACC/A3T will:
   2.7.1. (Added-AFGSC) Coordinate Air Force and Joint aerial events that include USAF
   assets for the Washington DC NCR as requested by HQ USAF/A3TA. EXCEPTION: Event
   POC will coordinate access into Prohibited Area 56 (if required).
   2.7.2. (Added-AFGSC) Supervise the CAF ACT program, to include coordinating manning
   requirements.
2.8. (Added-AFGSC) Ground Liaison Officer (GLO) Requirements. A GLO/ACT is
required when the aerial event must be synchronized to other events on the ground, when real-
time coordination with ATC is required, or when multiple participants require real-time de-
confliction. Normally the GLO, with radio equipment, will be at the flyover site prior to the time
on target (TOT) to assist the flight lead and act as a safety observer.
   2.8.1. (Added-AFGSC) The GLO should be a rated officer approved by the commander of
   the unit providing the aircraft, except when HQ ACC is providing the ACT.
   2.8.2. (Added-AFGSC) At events such as open houses or air shows, a GLO is not required
   when the event provides an operations director, air operations manager, air boss, or similar
   individual to control aerial events.

                                          Chapter 3

                               EVENT APPROVAL PROCESS

3.1. General Approval Process. Air Force participation in any event requires approval from
Public Affairs and Operations. Public Affairs is concerned with the appropriateness of an event
for Air Force involvement. Operational approval is concerned with operational issues. For public
events outside the United States, Canada and Mexico, the combatant commander has authority
over the approval and participation in events within the command’s Area of Responsibility
(AOR). In this case, comply with combatant command directives and utilize this chapter as
general guidance for the event. See paragraph 5.9 for additional requirements for overseas
events.
   3.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Units participating in aerial events, as identified in Attachment 1
   (Terms) of the basic publication, are responsible for ensuring the event sponsor has obtained
   any required permission or waivers to applicable FAA, Air Force, or DOD directives. Units
   may contact HQ AFGSC/A3BA for additional information.
3.2. Public Event Approval. Civilian sponsors of public events in the United States, Canada
and Mexico seeking Air Force aviation support must request event approval from SAF/PA using
DD Form 2535, Request for Military Aerial Support. Military sponsors of public events are also
required to send the DD Form 2535 (except as noted in paragraph 3.2.2) through their
MAJCOM/PA to SAF/PA with as much lead time as possible (usually a minimum of 45 days),
before any Air Force asset can participate in their events. SAF/PA evaluates the information in
the DD Form 2535 to determine the eligibility of the events specified for the aviation support
requested using the guidance found in DoD Directive 5410.18, DoD Instruction 5410.19, AFI
35-101, and other applicable publications and instructions. For a comprehensive discussion on
the DD Form 2535 or to obtain a copy, see the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web site
(http://www.airshows.pa.hq.af.mil/) and select ―Request Procedures.‖ Civilian sponsors
seeking aviation support (flyovers or AFPT demos) for public events that directly support
commemorations of patriotic holidays are still required to submit a DD Form 2535. Civilian or
military sponsors who seek Air Force aviation support for public events planned outside the
United States, Canada and Mexico will comply with COCOM directives to obtain event
approval. The DD Form 2535 may be submitted to MAJCOM/PA (in lieu of SAF/PA) for events
that involve only static display, or when the events directly support the commemoration of a
Patriotic Holiday (i.e., not in conjunction with a sporting event; see paragraph 3.6.2.1.1).
   3.2.1. SAF/PA determines eligibility, IAW DoD and AF policy, for the following:
       3.2.1.1. Aviation-related events (aviation shows, aviation fairs, aviation expositions,
       airport dedications, events primarily designed to encourage the advancement of aviation,
       and civic events that contribute to the public knowledge of Armed Forces aviation
       equipment and capabilities)—SAF/PA processes event approval requests for aviation-
       related public events IAW standing, internal procedures and posts notification of those
       approved to the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web site.
       3.2.1.2. Non-aviation related events (e.g., professional/amateur sports, community
       relations events, parades, festivals, etc.)—SAF/PA processes event approval for non-
       aviation related public events IAW Exception-to-Policy (ETP) procedures. The ETP
AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012                                                          21


      process involves the HQ USAF/A3 community as well as SAF/PA and is outlined in
      paragraph 3.5. ETP approvals are granted only when participation is determined to be in
      the best interest of the USAF. Event sponsors should follow the ETP procedures posted
      on the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web site when requesting event approval for
      non-aviation related events. The DD Form 2535 and ETP documentation should reach
      SAF/PA 45 days in advance of the event’s date. Forms received within 14 days of an
      event are generally not considered for support.
   3.2.2. Approved Military-Sponsored Public Events. The following on-base public events are
   approved for Air Force aviation support and need no further Public Affairs approval.
   Operations approval (i.e., participation approval) for the type of aviation support planned for
   these events is still required.
      3.2.2.1. Military open house events. A DD Form 2535 is required for DoD
      demonstration team requests. A copy must be forwarded through MAJCOM/PA to
      SAF/PA for consolidation, prioritization and posting.
      3.2.2.2. USAF Academy flyovers. See Chapter 5 for procedures.
      3.2.2.3. The National Guard Academy of Military Science flyovers.
3.3. Military Event Approval. Military event approval rests with the MAJCOM hosting the
event or as specified in DoD policy.
   3.3.1. Approved Military Events. The following military events are approved for Air Force
   aviation support IAW current DoD and AF Public Affairs policy and need no further Public
   Affairs coordination. Operations approval (i.e., participation approval) for the type of
   aviation support planned for these events is still required. Approval for military events does
   not constitute approval for an aerial review (see paragraphs 1.4.3, 3.6.3, and 4.3 for aerial
   review criteria, restrictions and approval levels).
      3.3.1.1. On-base patriotic observances (see paragraph 3.6.2.1 for off-base criteria).
      3.3.1.2. Retirement ceremonies and change of command ceremonies (see paragraph
      3.6.2.2 for criteria).
      3.3.1.3. Funeral or memorial events (see paragraph 3.6.2.3 for criteria).
      3.3.1.4. On-base unit change of aircraft and unit flag retirement ceremonies.
      3.3.1.5. The installation commander may deem other on-base military events eligible
      based on the contribution such events make to fostering esprit de corps, military values
      and patriotism, and on their ability to stand the test of public scrutiny. Examples of other
      eligible events are: military graduation ceremonies, retreat ceremonies, memorial
      ceremonies, and military parades. MAJCOMs have the authority to approve flyovers or
      jump platform aircraft by their assigned operational aircraft in support of approved events
      on their respective command bases.
   3.3.2. Disapproved Military Events. The following military events or ceremonies are not
   approved for Air Force aviation support IAW current DoD and AF policy: off-base
   retirement ceremonies, off-base change of command ceremonies, off-base unit flag
   retirement ceremonies, and off-base unit change of aircraft ceremonies.
 22                                          AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012


3.4. SAF/PA Approval Process. Once SAF/PA determines an event appropriate for Air Force
aviation support, it is posted to the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web site
(http://www.airshows.pa.hq.af.mil/) as an ―Eligible Event.‖ This is the primary means SAF/PA
uses to communicate with event sponsors and military flying units and/or AF parachute
demonstration teams on event approval. Being declared eligible does not mean Air Force
―participation approval‖ has been granted (this is an Operations consideration) or that a unit has
volunteered to provide the event aviation support.
   3.4.1. Units wishing to volunteer to support an event must indicate their intent on the
   website or via telephone to SAF/PAN. Event sponsors may contact units to solicit aviation
   support for their events.
       3.4.1.1. Units volunteering for any ETP event must notify SAF/PAN and MAJCOM of
       their intent to support not later than 7 days prior to the event (normally 14 days prior or
       earlier). All events that do not have a volunteer unit will be removed from the web site 7
       days prior and will not be considered for support. Units must also coordinate with event
       sponsors.
       3.4.1.2. MAJCOMs may require a unit to volunteer via MAJCOM rather than directly
       with SAF/PAN (see MAJCOM supplement to this instruction).
   3.4.2. SAF/PA and SAF/IA, in turn, are the approval authorities for events planned
   specifically for a foreign dignitary, to include the type and level of aviation support that is
   appropriate. Event sponsors are to submit requests at least 45 calendar days in advance.
3.5. Exception-to-Policy Procedures for Public Events. Public events for which ETP
procedures apply must be evaluated and approved by both SAF/PAN and HQ USAF/A3O;
participation approval is delegated to the MAJCOMs for the aviation support that approved ETP
events are ultimately rendered (see Chapter 4). The event sponsor initiates the ETP process by
submitting a DD Form 2535 to SAF/PA IAW procedures listed in AFI 35-101, Chapter 8, and
the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web site. The following procedures outline the ETP
approval process for public events unless aviation related (IAW paragraph 3.2.1.1) or in direct
support of a Patriotic Holiday.
   3.5.1. Annually HQ USAF/A3O and SAF/PA will release a joint message, categorizing as
   depicted below, the events for the coming year for which event sponsors are requesting ETP
   event approval. The message will assign the level of aviation support considered appropriate
   for selected events by name and for other events by category.
       3.5.1.1. Category 1 (Cat 1). Events designated Cat 1 will be listed by event name and
       are automatically granted event approval—they are of such importance that every effort
       will be taken to support them. Aviation support is pre-approved up to a four-ship
       formation. Volunteer units will be solicited—if no units volunteer, HQ USAF/A3O will
       coordinate with appropriate MAJCOMs and task selected units for aviation support.
       Relatively few ETP events will fall into Cat 1 (some examples are the Super Bowl, the
       Rose Bowl, the Indianapolis 500, etc.).
       3.5.1.2. Category 2 (Cat 2). Events designated Cat 2 will be listed by general classes of
       events, such as a specific sport or events for which Air Force Recruiting Service has a
       sponsorship role. As events are placed in Cat 2, they are granted event approval and
AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012                                                          23


      aviation support is pre-approved up to a four-ship formation. Cat 2 events are supported
      by volunteer units and typically will not be tasked.
      3.5.1.3. Category 3 (Cat 3). Events not identified under Cat 1 or 2 fall into Cat 3.
      SAF/PA and HQ USAF/A3O will jointly determine if a given Cat 3 event warrants event
      approval and, if approved, will specify an appropriate type and level of aviation support
      (e.g., 4-ship, 2-ship, single-ship, etc.). Approved Cat 3 events are to be supported by
      volunteer units and typically will not be tasked.
   3.5.2. Events approved under one of the categories above are considered to have ETP event
   approval and are posted to the U.S. Air Force Aerial Events Support web site. HQ
   USAF/A3O delegates participation approval to MAJCOM/A3 for events approved under the
   above categories. MAJCOM/A3 will ensure that the volunteer unit will support the event as
   an addition to an approved training mission and that the support rendered will pass the test of
   public scrutiny (i.e. training accomplished, impact to operations, proximity of event to the
   base, additional support requirements, and wing commander support). Once participation
   approval is granted, the MAJCOM/A3 office responsible for aerial events will inform HQ
   USAF/A3OO NLT two working days prior to the event. Notification will include at a
   minimum the participation approval, unit, type, and number of supporting aircraft.
3.6. Specific Aviation Support for Public or Military Events - Event Approval
Considerations. The following paragraphs outline additional guidance bearing on the event
approval process (see Approval Matrix in Attachment 2).
   3.6.1. Static Display. Events for which static displays are requested require Public Affairs
   event approval or as delegated in AFI 35-101, Chapter 8. Refer to paragraph 3.6.2.2 for
   Retirement or Change of Command ceremony criteria.
   3.6.2. Flyover. In general, an event for which a flyover is requested requires Public Affairs
   event approval IAW paragraphs 3.2 through 3.5 above, except as noted below.
      3.6.2.1. Off-Base Patriotic Holiday. As a matter of DoD and Air Force policy, aviation
      support in the form of flyovers (or AFPT demonstrations) is authorized for off-base
      patriotic observances, i.e., commemorative events held in support of patriotic holidays.
      Such events must be evaluated by at least MAJCOM/PA prior to receiving aviation
      support to ensure compliance with governing policies and procedures. The
      commemorative event for which the flyover (or AFPT demonstration) is performed must
      occur within seven days of the national day of observance of the holiday.
          3.6.2.1.1. The commemorative event for which the flyover (or AFPT demonstration)
          is performed must directly support the patriotic holiday. Non-commemorative events
          merely falling within seven days of the national days of observance for the applicable
          holidays are not eligible for flyovers (or AFPT demonstrations), unless approved by
          SAF/PA through normal procedures. An example of a non-commemorative event
          would be a sporting event held on or near Independence Day, even one with a solemn
          ceremony or moment of silence.
          3.6.2.1.2. See paragraph 3.6.2.4 for guidance on use of the Missing Man Formation
          at patriotic observances.
 24                                           AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012


          3.6.2.1.3. The event sponsor must submit a completed DD Form 2535 to
          MAJCOM/PA or SAF/PA, where it is reviewed to ensure the event is actually a
          commemorative event suitable for Air Force participation. Local bases receiving DD
          Forms 2535 should forward them through their MAJCOM/PA and on to SAF/PA, if
          applicable.
       3.6.2.2. Retirement/Change of Command Ceremony. Flyovers or aerial reviews for
       off-base retirement or change of command ceremonies are not permitted. Ceremonies
       eligible for aerial support, if they are held on-base, are approved only for the following
       personnel as noted below:
          3.6.2.2.1. The Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) or any combatant commander
          is authorized an aerial review. Air Force participation in COCOM multi-service or
          multi-national aerial reviews is approved. MAJCOMs will provide an information
          copy to HQ USAF/A3O containing the number and type of aircraft participating.
          3.6.2.2.2. The Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force (VCSAF), a MAJCOM/CC or a
          State Adjutant General is authorized a flyover by a single formation (up to four-ship).
          3.6.2.2.3. A MAJCOM/CV, a NAF/CC, or a Center/CC is authorized a flyover by a
          single aircraft.
          3.6.2.2.4. AFPT jumps in lieu of flyovers are allowed for the personnel authorized
          above.
          3.6.2.2.5. On-base retirement and change of command ceremonies for any other
          military members are not eligible for an Air Force flyover, except when approved
          IAW ETP procedures (paragraph 3.6.2.2.6).
          3.6.2.2.6. Exception-to-policy requests for flyovers supporting retirement and change
          of command ceremonies require HQ USAF/CV approval. HQ USAF/CV approval is
          required for a flyover if the participating aircraft is (are) from another service, nation,
          or civilian organization.
          3.6.2.2.7. MAJCOMs may authorize aviation support, with their respective aircraft,
          in the form of static displays for on-base retirement or change of command
          ceremonies (as designated in MAJCOM supplement to this instruction).
       3.6.2.3. Funeral or Memorial Flyovers. Funeral and memorial services for members
       who meet the governing criteria are eligible for Air Force flyovers. Funeral and memorial
       service flyover requests will be initiated by the servicing base Mortuary Officer or Air
       Force Mortuary Affairs and staffed through MAJCOMs (Mortuary Affairs and
       Operations directorates) to HQ USAF/A3OO. Funeral flyover request procedures can be
       found in AFI 34-242. A funeral or memorial flyover is to be flown as part of a training
       sortie, not as a stand-alone mission.

NOTE: The servicing base Mortuary Affairs or Air Force Mortuary Affairs is the single point of
contact for the next of kin.
          3.6.2.3.1. Eligibility. The following list outlines those eligible for an Air Force
          funeral/memorial flyover:
              3.6.2.3.1.1. Active duty or currently serving Air Reserve Component (ARC)
AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012                                                         25


             rated officers (pilots, navigators, air battle managers, observers, and flight
             surgeons) and Career Enlisted Aviators (1AXXX enlisted crewmembers, i.e.
             flight engineers, loadmasters, boom operators, etc.). This category includes those
             taking courses of instruction leading to an aeronautical rating. Treat ARC
             members the same as active duty (eligible when death occurs whether on or off
             duty). This includes ARC members not on unit training assembly (UTA) or
             military orders.
             3.6.2.3.1.2. Active duty or currently serving ARC non-rated officers, non-Career
             Enlisted Aviators, and Operations Support Flyers (as defined in AFI 11-402,
             Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, i.e. nurses,
             medical technicians, intelligence specialists, etc.) but only when death occurs in
             the line of duty while performing aviation duties.
             3.6.2.3.1.3. Dignitaries of the Armed Forces and federal government. HQ
             USAF/A3O has the authority to designate Dignitaries of the Armed Forces;
             requests with full justification must be made through the MAJCOM staff to HQ
             AF/A3OO.
             3.6.2.3.1.4. Active duty or retired USAF 3-star and 4-star general officers,
             regardless of aeronautical rating.
             3.6.2.3.1.5. Active Duty or retired Chief Master Sergeants of the Air Force
             (CMSAF).
             3.6.2.3.1.6. USAF members (active duty, retired or honorably separated) who
             have been awarded the Medal of Honor, Air Force Cross, Army Distinguished
             Service Cross, or Navy Cross.
             3.6.2.3.1.7. USAF aviators (active duty, retired or honorably separated) who have
             achieved at least one or more officially recognized aerial victories. The Air Force
             Historical Research Agency is the official source for aerial victories.
             3.6.2.3.1.8. USAF members (active duty, retired or honorably separated) who
             were Prisoners of War.

NOTE: Repatriated remains of individuals meeting the requirements of paragraph 3.6.2.3.1.1
or 3.6.2.3.1.2 are entitled to flyover honors.
          3.6.2.3.2. Although a funeral/memorial flyover may be authorized by meeting the
          above criteria, it may not always be appropriate. A funeral or memorial flyover is part
          of the honors bestowed on the deceased. If the lifestyle of an individual during or
          following his or her military service is not within the standards normally expected of
          a military professional or if the circumstances surrounding the death reflect
          negatively on the Air Force, a funeral flyover may not be approved in all cases. HQ
          USAF/A3O will make the determination in these cases.
          3.6.2.3.3. If a deceased member is eligible, no further HQ USAF approval is
          required. MAJCOMs grant participation approval for funeral/memorial flyovers
          (inform HQ USAF/A3OO).
26                                        AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012


        3.6.2.3.4. Memorial Flyovers. Procedures and approval levels for memorial flyovers
        are the same as for funeral flyovers. Memorial flyovers commemorate or recognize an
        individual, group, or historically significant event. MAJCOMs may approve on-base
        flyovers in this category (may be delegated to Wing/CC). For deceased members
        authorized a flyover per paragraph 3.6.2.3.1, and when the funeral service is held off-
        base, MAJCOM may authorize an additional memorial flyover at the base to which
        the individual was assigned (inform HQ USAF/A3OO). An off-base memorial
        flyover on other than the five patriotic holidays requires an ETP approved by HQ
        USAF/A3O and SAF/PAN.
        3.6.2.3.5. Exceptions-to-Policy. Servicing base Mortuary Affairs initiates requests
        for exceptions to funeral and memorial service policy and staffs the request through
        MAJCOMs to HQ USAF/A3OO. Requests that are handled directly by Air Force
        Mortuary Affairs are staffed to HQ USAF/A3OO. Exceptions-to-policy are based on
        appropriate use of limited resources, and are typically considered only for service
        marked by valor or heroism, or has significantly impacted the aviation community or
        aviation history. ETP requests must reach HQ USAF AF/A3OO at least 5 working
        days prior to the event. HQ USAF/A3OO will coordinate a package for HQ
        USAF/CVA decision. Include the following in the request:
            3.6.2.3.5.1. DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active
            Duty, or similar discharge documentation recording the individual’s honorable
            discharge, rank, and decorations.
            3.6.2.3.5.2. A letter from the next of kin or the person acting on their behalf
            requesting the flyover.
            3.6.2.3.5.3. A biography of the individual’s service. Include commands and
            significant acts or service to the Air Force and the country.
            3.6.2.3.5.4. Any other information about the individual’s military service that is
            notable.
        3.6.2.3.6. If an exception is approved, HQ USAF/A3OO will inform MAJCOMs to
        solicit a volunteer unit to perform the flyover. Due to the short-notice nature of many
        funerals, MAJCOMs may be asked to solicit volunteers while the approval package is
        being processed.
     3.6.2.4. Missing Man Formation. The missing man formation is a flyover reserved for
     appropriate occasions and is employed only on those occasions when the theme is solemn
     and commemorative. This formation may be flown for any funeral or memorial approved
     IAW this AFI or to support commemorative events on the following Patriotic Holidays:
     1) Memorial Day, 2) National POW/MIA Day, and 3) Veterans Day. When the missing
     man formation is flown on a Patriotic Holiday, the commemorative event, which the
     formation supports, may not be held in conjunction with another event such as an airshow
     or sporting event. All other uses of the missing man formation require the approval of
     MAJCOM/A3 (cannot be delegated).
     3.6.2.5. For additional information, see paragraph 3.2, 3.3 and Chapter 5.
AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012                                                         27


   3.6.3. Aerial Review. OASD/PA approval is required for all CONUS public event aerial
   reviews and overseas public event aerial reviews involving CONUS based aircraft. This
   approval is not required at airshows, open houses or international trade shows.
      3.6.3.1. Submit aerial review requests through the MAJCOM to SAF/PAN (inform HQ
      USAF/A3OO) 45 calendar days before the event date. The request should include the
      date, location, type of event (dedication ceremony, retirement, etc.), and number/type of
      aircraft. SAF/PA will coordinate OASD/PA approval NLT 30 calendar days before the
      event to allow time for MAJCOM/A3 or higher participation approval. For the approval
      of an event for which an aerial review is requested, and which is hosted at a venue
      outside the United States, Canada or Mexico, see paragraph 5.9 and Attachment 2.
      3.6.3.2. The performance of multiple aerial events for a single public event constitutes a
      significant level of Air Force support and communicates to the general public, and event
      organizer, a ―public affairs‖ endorsement for the event that is as significant as the
      endorsement that an aerial review would render. To ensure the proper levels of scrutiny
      and control, proposals for aviation support involving the performance of multiple aerial
      events for a single public event will be subject to the same approval process that a
      proposal for an aerial review would receive for the same public event. To this end,
      SAF/PAN and AF/A3O will approve aviation support proposals for single public events
      that combine an AFPT and flyover, or a flyover and aircraft demonstration (the total
      number of combined individual elements may not exceed four). An example of such a
      combination of aerial events is a 3-ship of F-16s and an AFPT demonstration. Aviation
      support proposals for single public events that combined multiple aerial events will be
      reviewed on a case-by-case basis. When determining the number of elements, the jump
      platform aircraft does not count unless it is performing in some other function in addition
      to being the jump platform.

NOTE: The guidance in this paragraph does not apply to aviation support proposals involving
multiple, combined aerial events planned for open house events, public airshows, and
international trade shows.
   3.6.4. Aerial Demonstration.
      3.6.4.1. Although considered an aerial demonstration, AFPT performances have different
      approval procedures. See paragraph 5.4. AFPT demonstrations can be performed in lieu
      of flyovers for Patriotic Holidays (paragraph 3.6.2.1).
      3.6.4.2. Flying operations ostensibly conducted for training but which are actually
      intended to be viewed by non-military audiences are in fact aerial demonstrations and the
      events supported in this manner are public events falling under paragraphs 1.2 and 3.2.
      An example would be the use of Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT)
      missions to airdrop personnel and/or equipment for training while inviting a non-military
      audience to view the airdrop through a public advertising campaign (TV/radio
      announcements, newspaper ads, etc.). In this example, clearly the use of advertising to
      encourage the presence of non-military spectators establishes the activity as an aerial
      demonstration for a public event.
      3.6.4.3. Flying operations conducted for training purposes (whether using training or
      O&M funding) on a facility owned, leased or operated by the DoD, and intended for
28                                        AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012


     viewing by an audience limited to military personnel, civil service personnel, dependents
     and limited number of invited guests, constitute aerial demonstrations in support of
     military events, and paragraphs 1.3 and 3.3 apply.
AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012                                                            29

                          PARTICIPATION APPROVAL PROCESS

4.1. Static Displays. Participation approval for static displays is delegated to MAJCOM.
MAJCOM can delegate participation approval authority to a lower level. Before approving static
display, the decision process will include force protection concerns. Consider the safety
standards in Attachment 3, along with those in T.O. 00-80G, Make Safe Procedures for Public
Static Display series publications, in planning and staging each static display. Aircraft specific
guidance in a T.O. will supercede the general guidance in this AFI. The following guidelines
apply to all aircraft on static display:
   4.1.1. Aircraft on static display must be made safe according to Attachment 3 and
   applicable technical orders (TO).
   4.1.2. A minimum of one qualified aircrew member must be present to answer spectator
   questions and to ensure security at all times the static display is open to the public.
   4.1.3. Ordnance and Munitions. If an event does not involve the expenditure or display of
   munitions, download the aircraft of all expendable ordnance prior to deploying to the event
   site. ―Make safe‖ permanently mounted internal weapons according to applicable TO
   procedures. Place on public display only inert munitions, making them safe according to
   applicable TOs.
4.2. Flyover.
   4.2.1. Patriotic Holiday. Participation approval is at the MAJCOM level and is limited to a
   single pass flyover by a single aircraft or by a formation of not more than four aircraft of the
   same type. The commemorative event for which the flyover is performed must occur within
   seven days of the national day of observance of the holiday and must be in direct support of
   the holiday.
   4.2.2. Retirement/Change of Command Ceremony. Participation approval is at the
   MAJCOM level. AF/CV approval may be required for exceptions-to-policy (see paragraph
   3.6.2.2.6).
   4.2.3. Funeral or Memorial Flyovers. It is the responsibility of the MAJCOM to locate
   and identify volunteer flying units. MAJCOM can delegate participation approval authority
   to a lower level. Air Force participation in a funeral or memorial service is limited to a single
   flyover. It may be flown at the funeral (internment) service or at the memorial service, but
   not at both events (except as approved under paragraph 3.6.2.3.4, where the MAJCOM can
   approve an additional memorial flyover for eligible members at the base to which the
   individual was assigned). Funeral flyovers can be a single ship or a single formation with a
   maximum of four aircraft. A formation flyover may be flown as a missing man formation
   (inform HQ USAF/A3OO).
       4.2.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) Normally, AFGSC will coordinate aircraft for funeral or
       memorial flyovers in response to a unit request, HHQ tasking/request, or request from
       another MAJCOM/A3.
 30                                          AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012


   4.2.4. Missing Man Formation. Participation approval for on-base and off-base Patriotic
   Holidays (IAW paragraph 3.6.2.4) is at the MAJCOM level. All other off-base uses of the
   missing man formation require the approval of MAJCOM/A3 (cannot be delegated).
4.3. Aerial Review. After OASD/PA event approval (if required), the level of participation
approval is as follows:
   4.3.1. Assets from Single MAJCOM. Aerial reviews involving assets from a single
   MAJCOM require MAJCOM approval. MAJCOMs will inform HQ USAF/A3OO of aerial
   review approvals and assets involved (other than airshows, Open Houses and trade shows).
   4.3.2. Assets from Multiple MAJCOMs. Multi-MAJCOM aerial reviews require the
   approval of each command providing aircraft for the aerial review (inform HQ
   USAF/A3OO).
   4.3.3. Assets from Multiple Services/Nations, or Involve Civilian Aircraft. HQ
   USAF/A3/5 approval is required for all aerial reviews that combine USAF aircraft with
   aircraft from other services or nations or with civilian aircraft. Participation approval in
   OCONUS aerial reviews rests with the COCOM (inform HQ USAF/A3OO).
4.4. Aerial Demonstration. Aerial demonstrations are governed by the AFI 11-246 series of
instructions and require the participation approval of the owning MAJCOM.
   4.4.1. Lead MAJCOMs need not publish in their assigned volume the profiles that are
   uniquely tailored for a specific military or civilian event and which are planned for use on a
   one-time basis. Although the lead MAJCOM is released from the requirement to incorporate
   these uniquely tailored profiles in the command volume, the MAJCOM/A3 (or equivalent)
   having jurisdiction over the participating aircrew and aircraft must approve every uniquely
   tailored profile prior to its execution. If the uniquely tailored profile is planned to be used
   on a continuing basis, then the MAJCOM must submit the profile to the lead MAJCOM for
   possible inclusion in AFI 11-246 series.
      4.4.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Aircraft Capabilities/Rescue Demonstrations. Wings may
      wish to showcase various aspects of their training programs as a public demonstration of
      their unique mission capabilities. These demonstrations must use unit aircraft, must be
      reflective of the unit's Designed Operational Capability (DOC), and must use normal
      training profiles/events per AFGSC’s Ready Aircrew Program. Furthermore, units should
      normally perform these demonstrations only at their home airshow or local training
      locations. HQ AFGSC/A3 is the approval authority for all capabilities/rescue
      demonstrations performed before the public.
   4.4.2. MAJCOMs may publish profiles in the MAJCOM supplement to this instruction for
   flight operations or procedures falling outside the purview of the applicable AFI 11-246
   series.
   4.4.3. Aerial demonstration profiles, for any aircraft that is not covered under the AFI 11-
   246 series, must be approved by the MAJCOM/CC owning the aircraft. This will not be
   delegated. MAJCOM approved profiles can consist of multiple passes.
   4.4.4. AFPT demonstrations can be performed for commemorative events supporting
   Patriotic holidays instead of flyovers—participation approval is at the MAJCOM.
AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012                                                  31


  4.4.5. AFPT demonstrations supporting retirement/change of command ceremonies in lieu of
  authorized flyovers are allowed—participation approval is at the MAJCOM.

                                           Chapter 5

                                 ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE

5.1. USAF Academy (USAFA) On-Base Events. All definitions and policy regarding flyovers
and aerial reviews apply to the USAFA. Examples of approved on-base academy events are
graduation ceremonies, football games, parades, ceremonies with a patriotic/military theme, etc.
The commandant requests appropriate Air Force participation, which is limited to flyovers,
parachute demonstrations and glider demonstrations.
   5.1.1. Academy officials will notify participating MAJCOMs when flyovers are scheduled
   by more than one MAJCOM on the same day. Participation must be approved by the owning
   MAJCOM. When more than one flyover is scheduled within any three hour period, this
   notification will include as a minimum: flyover timing, number of aircraft in each flight,
   direction of flight, altitude, USAFA point of contact, and other information deemed
   necessary for safety of flight.
   5.1.2. For each event, the flyover will consist of not more than four aircraft of the same type
   making one pass.
   5.1.3. USAFA officials will notify HQ USAF/A3OO, SAF/PAN and SAF/PAM 10 days
   before the event date of any flyover that may have national media coverage (i.e., coverage of
   a football game or graduation).
   5.1.4. (Added-AFGSC) USAFA Flyovers. AFGSC Participation in USAFA Aerial
   Reviews is limited to a maximum of two or less AFGSC aircraft per event. AFGSC aircraft
   will not normally duplicate basic MDSs provided by other MAJCOMS/FOAs. USAFA will
   coordinate larger packages (greater than one flight) with HQ AFGSC/A3BA at least 14 days
   in advance when AFGSC aircraft are involved. Requests will be processed on a first come-
   first serve basis.
5.2. MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM Flyover Requests. Requests from one MAJCOM to another for
single-ship or formation flyovers in support of military events are approved by the MAJCOM
owning the requested assets.
   5.2.1. Within the USAF, requests for Air Force participation in a military event must be sent
   from requesting unit (base) to its parent MAJCOM and, if approved, from the parent
   MAJCOM to the MAJCOM owning the requested aircraft, except for requests supporting an
   open house. For an open house, the requesting unit may send a request for participation
   directly to the unit owning the desired aircraft or equipment; the owning unit will ensure all
   coordination/approval requirements imposed by the owning MAJCOM are satisfied before
   committing support.
   5.2.2. Air Force units are to follow MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM procedures when requesting
   aircraft from the US Army, Navy, or Marine Corps. For MAJCOM-to-MAJCOM requests,
   include HQ USAF/A3OO and SAF/PAN as information addressees whenever the approval
   level involves any of the following: HQ USAF/CV, HQ USAF/CVA, HQ USAF/A3/5, HQ
   USAF/A3O, SAF/AQ or OASD/PA.
AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012                                                           33



5.3. Dissimilar Formation. Formations of four or fewer aircraft of multiple MDS and the same
type are approved by MAJCOM/A3. Formations of four or fewer aircraft comprised of Air Force
aircraft with aircraft from other services or nations, or with civilian aircraft that do not meet
aerial review criteria (i.e., airshows, open houses or international trade shows) require
MAJCOM/CC approval (inform HQ USAF/A3OO for HQ USAF/CC and A3/5 visibility). It is
incumbent upon MAJCOMs to provide operational oversight when approving mixed MDS
formations of the same type. ACC Supplement 1 to AFI 11-246, Volume 1 covers ACC Heritage
Flight formations and AFI 11-246, Volume 2 covers AETC Texan Flight formations.
   5.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) Dissimilar Formations. See AFI 11-202V3_AFGSCSUP, General
   Flight Rules; and AFI 11-2MDSV3 for formation guidance. Units will request HQ
   AFGSC/A3 approval to participate in aerial events involving dissimilar formations.
   Aircrews will review Attachment 8 checklist, where applicable, before all formation
   flyovers. Dissimilar formations will be practiced prior to the event.
   5.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) Heritage Program. AFGSC does not have a Heritage Flight
   program. Formations flyovers involving AFGSC MDSs will operate as a Dissimilar
   Formation.
5.4. Air Force Parachute Team (AFPT). Event and participation approval for an AFPT
demonstration (i.e., by the United States Air Force Academy’s ―Wings of Blue‖) is granted using
the same procedures as a flyover (IAW Chapter 3 and Chapter 4). Air Force aircraft serving as
jump platforms for AFPT demonstrations at public or military events, do not require separate
approval. Event approval for the AFPT constitutes approval for the jump platform.

NOTE: If the aircraft serving as the jump platform is separately performing at the event (i.e.
additional flyover or aerial demonstration), then separate approval is required. For aircraft
serving as jump platforms supporting other service parachute team demonstrations, the ―event
approval‖ for the aircraft is in conjunction with the approval for the parachute team (inform
SAF/PAN and HQ USAF/A3OO). Owning MAJCOM may still require participation approval
for their ―jump platform‖ aircraft.
5.5. Record Flights and Flights of a Spectacular Nature. Flights of this nature require
SAF/PAN and HQ USAF/A3O approval. See AFI 35-101, Chapter 8 for additional restrictions.
5.6. Test Aircraft. Aerial events of any kind, including static displays, involving aircraft or
equipment undergoing testing in a research and development program require approval from
SAF/PAN, HQ USAF/A3/5, and SAF/AQ.
5.7. Heritage/Texan Flight Training Programs. The following guidance applies to the ACC
Heritage Flight and AETC Texan Flight Training programs.
5.7. (AFGSC) Heritage/Texan Flight Training Programs. Heritage Program. AFGSC does
not have a Heritage Flight program. Formations flyovers involving AFGSC MDSs will operate
as a Dissimilar Formation.
   5.7.1. The intent of the annual training program is to prepare Air Force aircrews and vintage
   aircraft pilots to safely fly in formation at public airshows and open house events that benefit
   Air Force recruiting and community relations programs. Appropriated funds may be
   expended for warbird aviation fuel associated with that training. Because warbird pilots and
 34                                          AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012


   support staff are acting in an official capacity related to DoD activities, use of invitational
   travel orders to pay travel, per diem, lodging and local transportation is also permitted as
   specified in the Joint Travel Regulation, Volume II, Appendix E. MAJCOM approved
   Blanket Purchase Agreements with contractors may be used to cover expenses.
   5.7.2. MAJCOMs will ensure compliance with applicable AFIs including AFI 11-401,
   Aviation Management. Military aircrew members and key military leadership may fly on
   warbird civil aircraft during training sessions. Military media personnel and civilian media
   personnel (as part of an approved media orientation flight IAW AFI 35-101) may fly as
   passengers on those warbirds engaged in observation flights provided the aircraft are not
   engaged in demonstration training or formation flights. Training is to take place over
   unpopulated areas. All warbirds must have liability insurance covering training flights and
   passengers.
   5.7.3. This guidance covers all training conferences and annual preseason flight training
   conducted in accordance with AFI 11-246. Secretary of Defense and CSAF policies
   regarding civilian pilots operating USAF aircraft still apply, unless specifically waived.
5.8. Airshows/Open Houses. The term "open house" identifies a traditional activity held on
military installations while the term ―airshow‖ identifies a civilian activity. Open house and
airshow have been used interchangeably in the past, but open house is a more comprehensive
term for the spectrum of events in the Air Force. Airshows and open houses may be supported by
multiple static displays, multiple flyovers (with multiple passes) and multiple aerial
demonstrations. AFI 10-1004 (when released) will provide guidance and procedures for planning
and conducting Air Force open houses. SAF/PA approves civilian airshows for Air Force support
(event approval IAW paragraph 3.2) and MAJCOMs approve the participation of their respective
aircraft.
5.9. Overseas Public and Military Events. For public events outside the United States,
Canada and Mexico, the combatant commanders exercise event and participation approval over
events falling within their respective Areas of Responsibility (AOR) (except as noted below).
The combatant commanders may delegate the responsibility for event and participation approval.
The delegates will notify SAF/PAN and HQ USAF/A3OO of their delegated authority. See
paragraph 5.10 for event and participation approval for international airshow and trade
exhibitions.
   5.9.1. MAJCOMs will inform HQ USAF/A3OO and SAF/PAN when CONUS based aircraft
   will participate in overseas events (public or military) at least 30 days prior to the event for
   CSAF visibility. Additionally, inform HQ USAF/A3OO and SAF/PAN for any USAF
   aircraft participation in overseas events at non-DoD facilities at least 30 days prior to the
   event for CSAF visibility. If the request from the event is short notice, precluding a 30-day
   notification, inform HQ USAF/A3OO and SAF/PAN immediately. Responsibility for this
   notification is primarily with the owning MAJCOM, but notification may come from the
   OCONUS MAJCOM. HQ USAF or OASD/PA approval may be required in some cases
   where CONUS based aircraft participate in overseas events.
   5.9.2. Aerial Reviews at overseas events with assets from multiple services or nations, or
   that involve civilian aircraft, will be approved IAW paragraph 4.3 in addition to combatant
   command directives (inform HQ USAF/A3OO).
AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012                                                          35


   5.9.3. Notwithstanding the combatant commanders’ participation approval authority over
   aircraft entering their respective AORs, the owning MAJCOMs’ operational control over
   their aircraft is not preempted or diminished.
   5.9.4. Aerial events of any kind involving aircraft or equipment undergoing testing in a
   research and development program require approval from SAF/PAN, HQ USAF/A3, and
   SAF/AQ.
   5.9.5. (Added-AFGSC) OCONUS Static Displays and Flyovers. If a Theater Air
   Component Commander approves a static display or flyover using AFGSC assets attached to
   his command, the affected unit(s) must notify HQ AFGSC/A3 of any profiles not IAW this
   instruction prior to performing. Assets that are not attached to another Theater Air
   Component Commander require approval of both the Theater Air Component Commander
   and HQ AFGSC/A3.
       5.9.5.1. (Added-AFGSC) Supplemental Guidance. Assets are required to adhere to
       both the Theater Air Component Commander’s and HQ AFGSC/A3’s AFI 11-209
       supplemental guidance whether or not they are attached to another Theater Air
       Component Commander. If there is a conflict between guidance, the more restrictive
       guidance takes precedence.
5.10. International Airshows and Trade Exhibitions. This paragraph applies to USAF direct
participation at international airshows and trade exhibitions, organized primarily for promoting
sales of aerospace and other defense products (IAW DoDD 7230.8). For international airshows
and other events that are organized only for the demonstration or display of aircraft and other
defense equipment in support of public affairs activities, see paragraph 5.9.
   5.10.1. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy (USD(P)) has approval authority for DoD
   participation in international airshows and trade exhibitions, as delegated by the Secretary of
   Defense. No Air Force organization can participate in an international airshow or trade
   exhibition unless the USD(P) has approved ―direct DoD participation‖ and satisfied the other
   provisions of the law. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), staff agency for
   USD(P), posts policy, guidelines, and status information on international airshows and trade
   exhibitions on its web site (http://www.dsca.osd.mil).
   5.10.2. Geographic combatant commanders, through their Air Force component
   commanders, and in conjunction with the US Embassy country team, implement USD(P)
   airshow policy and initiate requests for participation.
   5.10.3. The Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force, International Affairs (SAF/IA)
   coordinates Headquarters Air Force actions, to include politico-military analysis, validation
   of requirements IAW USAF Security Cooperation Guidance, identification of USAF assets
   requested, and coordination with industry.
   5.10.4. Additionally, HQ USAF/A3OO will submit the lists of requested USAF assets to the
   MAJCOMs to determine operational impact and to coordinate participation of assets from
   outside the requesting geographic combatant commander’s AOR. During this process, HQ
   USAF/A3O reconciles the asset requests against the MAJCOM’s operational concerns,
   develops requirement lists (with USAF senior leadership positions), and tasks support as
   required.

   5.10.5. MAJCOMs with units planning to participate in international airshows and trade
   exhibitions must first coordinate with DSCA via SAF/IA. This is normally accomplished
   during periodic teleconferences hosted by DSCA. Planning and execution details are
   developed by the MAJCOMs during this conference.

Terms
NOTE:—To avoid changing traditional terminology used by the Air Force to discuss aviation
support, the Air Force term aerial event as used in this instruction is synonymous with the DoD
term aerial demonstration and the Air Force term aerial demonstration is synonymous with the
DoD term aerial activity.
 40                                            AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012


Aerial Control Team (ACT)—A qualified individual or team of individuals who oversee and
control USAF aerial participation, and aerial participation by other organizations, in selected
public or military events. ACT can be used synonymously with Ground Liaison Officer (GLO)
for the purposes of this instruction.
Aerial Demonstration—Aerial demonstration, a subset of aviation support, includes virtually
every type of aerial participation by fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft in public or military
events (except aerial review and flyover): aerobatics, assault landing/takeoffs, aircraft weapons
or tactics demonstrations, USAF vintage aircraft programs, single-ship demonstration teams,
airdrop demonstrations of personnel or equipment, engine-running offload and aircraft backing
maneuvers, in-flight refueling demonstrations, AFPT performances, CSAR demonstrations and
helicopter flight demonstrations consisting of steep approach, quick-stop landing, hovering, fire
suppression, and personnel AIE. Aerial demonstration is synonymous with the phrases aerial
demo, aircraft demonstration, aircraft capabilities demonstration, and aircraft CAPEX.
Aerial Demonstration Team—An officially designated DoD demonstration team such as the
USAF Thunderbirds, US Navy Blue Angels, and US Army Golden Knights, etc. This term can
be applied to USAF vintage aircraft (ACC Heritage Flight Program and AETC T-6A Texan II
Aerial Demonstration Team) and MAJCOM single-ship demonstration teams.
Aerial Event—Aerial event, synonymous with aviation support, comprises static display,
flyover, aerial review and aerial demonstration. Aerial demonstration includes a wide variety of
aerial performances (see definition, above).
Aerial Review—Aerial review, a subset of aviation support, is a flyover of more than four
aircraft, or of multiple types of aircraft, or of aircraft representing more than one military service
or nation, regardless of horizontal/timing separation of flying elements. An aerial review may
include civilian aircraft. It may have elements in trail formation and will not involve precision
maneuvers or demonstrations. The elements of the aerial review may be individual aircraft,
formations, or a combination of individual aircraft and formations. A single element flyover
involving four or fewer aircraft of multiple MDS of the same type from the same Military
Service is not considered an aerial review.
Aircraft Demonstration—See Aerial Demonstration.
Aircraft Weapons or Tactics Demonstration—An aerial demonstration of aircraft employing
or simulating the employment of munitions, weapons, or combat tactics. May include use of
ground-based pyrotechnics for effect.
Air Force Parachute Team (AFPT) Demonstration—An aerial free-fall parachute
demonstration conducted by an official Air Force parachute demonstration team (i.e. United
States Air Force Academy’s ―Wings of Blue‖).
Area of Responsibility—The geographical area associated with a commanders authority to plan
and conduct operations.
Assault Landing Demonstration—An aircraft capabilities demonstration illustrating a
technique used for landing on short runways. The aircraft is flown at a speed slightly above
aircraft stall speed and on a steeper-than-normal approach path. After touchdown, maximum
engine reverse thrust and braking are applied to stop the aircraft.
AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012                                                          41


Assault (Max Performance) Takeoff Demonstration—An aircraft capabilities demonstration
illustrating a takeoff technique used for departing short runways employing maximum takeoff
power and climb rate for the aircraft. Also referred to as Maximum Performance Takeoff or
Maximum Effort Takeoff.
Aviation Support—Aviation support, synonymous with aerial event, comprises static display,
flyover, aerial review and aerial demonstration. Aerial demonstration includes a wide variety of
aerial activities.
Capabilities Demonstration or Capabilities Exercise (CAPEX)—Normally associated with
aircraft demonstrating unique characteristics of a weapon system or group of weapon systems. A
capabilities demonstration is one that shows the aircraft conducting maneuvers usually
associated with its employment and is common to the airframe being shown.
Civil Twilight—The period that ends in the evening when the center of the sun’s disk is 6
degrees below the horizon and begins in the morning when the center of the sun’s disk is 6
degrees below the horizon, as published in the American Air Almanac, converted to local time.
This is the limit at which twilight illumination is sufficient, under good weather conditions, for
terrestrial objects to be clearly distinguished, and the horizon is clearly defined under good
atmospheric conditions in the absence of moonlight or other illumination. In the morning before
the beginning of Civil Twilight and in the evening after the end of Civil Twilight, artificial
illumination is normally required to carry on ordinary outdoor activities.
Congested Area—Cities, towns, and settlements or the area surrounding an open-air assembly
of persons.
DD Form 2535, Request for Military Aerial Support—The form that event sponsors or
organizers use to request military aerial support. It is normally submitted to SAF/PA to obtain
event approval as a first step in gaining aerial support.
Demonstration Pilot or Crew—A highly qualified pilot or crew trained, proficient, and
certified in the maneuvers or demonstration to be performed.
Dissimilar Formation Flyover—A single element flyover involving four or fewer aircraft of
multiple MDS of the same type (i.e. F-15, F-16).
Eligible Events—Aerial events that have been screened by SAF/PA or other designated
organization and deemed appropriate for Air Force participation.
Equipment Drop Demonstration—An aircraft capabilities demonstration illustrating the
airdrop of equipment on platforms rigged with parachutes, individual containers rigged with
parachutes, or small door bundles rigged with parachutes.
Event Approval—Issued when SAF/PA or other designated organization, determines the event
(e.g., aviation show/open house, sporting event, commemoration, or civic event) is eligible for
Air Force participation. Some events have automatic approval by virtue of AF or DoD policy;
otherwise, depending on the nature of the event, the evaluation process is conducted by one of
several agencies. Event approval does not imply participation approval.
Exception-to-Policy Procedure—Procedures outlining the process to gain SAF/PA event
approval when the military or civilian event does not fall within one of the categories addressed
by DoD or AF policy. Submit such requests to SAF/PA who will route appropriate requests to
HQ USAF/A3OO for coordination. See paragraph 3.2.

AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012                                                             43


formations) conduct individual flyover passes over the same reference point on the ground
regardless of timing separation between the flyover aircraft or flyover formations.
Multiple Passes—A flyover arrangement for a single event in which the flyover aircraft, or the
flyover formation, maneuvers after the initial over flight of the desired reference point so as to
execute one or more additional passes over the same point.
Next of Kin (NOK)—For the purposes of this instruction, the closest, living relative to a
deceased person.
Off-base—On or over any location other than on-base.

The person’s conduct, while in captivity, must have been honorable.
Public Event—Public events are community relations events not connected with the military
functioning of the Department of Defense and intended primarily for non-military audiences.
Some examples include military Open House events, ceremonies, exhibitions, expositions,
athletic contests, fairs, parades, tattoos, airshows, international airshow and trade exhibitions, or
similar programs. These events may be on or off-base; CONUS or OCONUS. Public events can
be sponsored by either DoD or non-DoD organizations. Military exercises, movements,
maneuvers, or operations are not considered to be public events merely on the basis of being
incidentally observed by the general public. Such events can be good community relations and
recruiting opportunities.
Record Flights and Flights of a Spectacular Nature—A flight to achieve an official world-
class record regarding speed, distance, altitude, duration of flight, etc. National and world
aviation records conducted in the United States are sanctioned, observed, and certified through

 44                                            AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012


Retirement or Change of Command Ceremony—These are military events. A retirement
ceremony honors a retiring military member and a change of command ceremony formally
recognizes the transfer of command authority from one military member to another (see
paragraph 3.6.2.2).
Show Line—A show line is a prominent reference line appearing on the ground in the
"Aerobatic Demonstration Area/Flying Display Area" established for an Airshow or Open
House. The show line must be easily identifiable from the air and could be an existing structure
already present such as a runway, taxiway, canal, breakwater, or road, or any straight line
marked off by a snow fence, canvas panels, etc. The show line is a prescribed distance from the
spectator area and serves as the basic reference line for aerial demonstrations performances.
Spectator Area—The area specifically set aside at an airshow or Open House for people to view
the aerial demonstrations performed for the event (see paragraph 1.6.7).
Static Display—Static Display, a subset of aviation support, is the ground display of any aircraft
and its related equipment not involving engine start, taxi, or flight.
Test/Evaluation Aircraft or Equipment—New aircraft or equipment undergoing
developmental test and evaluation that have not yet met initial operating capability (IOC).
Training Static Display—The ground display of any aircraft and its related equipment used for
the sole purpose of training local civilian medical, rescue, fire, or law enforcement personnel.
Training static displays do not involve engine start, taxi, or flight. Spectators will not be allowed
in the training areas. This can be on or off-base.
Type—The role of the aircraft from a public affairs perspective. DoD defines type as either
tactical, transport or rotary wing. Air Force further categorizes aircraft type as: tactical (F-22, F-
15, F-16, A-10, F-117, B-1, B-2, B-52), tanker/transport (C-130, C-17, C-5, KC-10, KC-135),
trainer (T-1, T-37, T-38, T-6) and rotary wing (UH-1, HH-60, MH-53, CV-22). Aircraft not
listed are considered their own unique type and will comply with multi-type restrictions in this
instruction (i.e. Aerial Review or dissimilar formation). It is understood that true aircraft roles
and missions are numerous and it would be difficult to categorize all aircraft. These are general
groupings based on size, mission and/or configuration as viewed by the general public.
Individual missions and series are grouped under the same design for the purpose of this
definition (i.e. EC-130H, and C-130J). It is incumbent upon MAJCOMs to provide operational
oversight when approving mixed MDS formations of the same type.
Unit Change of Aircraft Ceremony—A ceremony that recognizes the conversion of aircraft
type within a unit.
Unit Flag Retirement Ceremony—A ceremony during which an active or air reserve
component unit is deactivated and the unit flag retired.
Unit Training Assembly (UTA)—Unit training periods consisting of a minimum of 4 hours
each, to include the majority of assigned personnel. Normally four UTAs are scheduled on one
weekend each month.
Vintage Aircraft Program—For the purpose of this instruction, the USAF vintage aircraft
programs are the Heritage Flight Program operated by ACC, and the T-6A Texan II Aerial
Demonstration Team operated by AETC.

      A3.14.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) We represent the more than 23,000 Airmen of Air Force
      Global Strike Command –both ICBMs and nuclear-capable bombers who proudly serve
      and protect the United States of America.
      A3.14.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) Nuclear-capable is an important distinction under the
      START treaties. Under New START, the US. will render some number of bombers
      unable to fly or else unable to deliver nuclear weapons.
      A3.14.2.3. (Added-AFGSC) Air Force Global Strike Command Airmen provide
      security to the nation 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365-days a year.
      A3.14.2.4. (Added-AFGSC) Air Force Global Strike Command’s motto is ―To Deter
      and Assure‖ - to deter potential adversaries and assure our allies of that same defense. If
      we have a credible nuclear defense, it adds to international stability and is a disincentive
      for other nations to nuclearize, even as we draw down our stockpile and delivery
      vehicles.
      A3.14.2.5. (Added-AFGSC) Air shows demonstrate the capabilities of our Air Force
      and investment in international peace and stability.
      A3.14.2.6. (Added-AFGSC) Bombers give the US. the ability to strike any target on the
      globe, even flying from the continental U.S. Bombers are responsive and recallable. They
      are a clear demonstration of American capability and resolve.
   A3.14.3. (Added-AFGSC) General Tips for Dealing with the Public at Air Shows.
      A3.14.3.1. (Added-AFGSC) Small talk and banter about a wide range of topics is less
      helpful than repeating to many people the same, strategic messages.
      A3.14.3.2. (Added-AFGSC) Listen to the ENTIRE question. Decide if you want to
      answer it, or if you’d rather use an existing strategic message. You are under no
      obligation to answer the question they ask; you can instead answer the question you
      wished they’d asked.
          A3.14.3.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) Pause; think about what you want to say
          A3.14.3.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) Respond
          A3.14.3.2.3. (Added-AFGSC) Stop talking when you have finished your thought.
      A3.14.3.3. (Added-AFGSC) Stick to messages, and use them again and again! You will
      get tired of saying the same thing over and over. If you do, you are succeeding.
      A3.14.3.4. (Added-AFGSC) Do’s:

        A3.14.3.4.1. (Added-AFGSC) Talk about yourself as and why you are happy to
        serve your country in the military
        A3.14.3.4.2. (Added-AFGSC) Talk about how great it is to be an American Airman
        A3.14.3.4.3. (Added-AFGSC) Talk about the unclassified parts of your job in
        relation to the weapon system.
        A3.14.3.4.4. (Added-AFGSC) Stay within your area of expertise. If you own,
        command or did it, then talk about it.
        A3.14.3.4.5. (Added-AFGSC) There is nothing wrong with saying, ―I don’t know.‖
        A3.14.3.4.6. (Added-AFGSC) Be BRIEF and to the point.
     A3.14.3.5. (Added-AFGSC) Don’ts
        A3.14.3.5.1. (Added-AFGSC) Don’t say ―no comment.‖
        A3.14.3.5.2. (Added-AFGSC) Don’t use jargon,
        A3.14.3.5.3. (Added-AFGSC) Don’t talk about your personal partisan political
        beliefs or criticize the POTUS.
        A3.14.3.5.4. (Added-AFGSC) Don’t speculate about world events or ongoing wars,
        etc. Stick with the role of your weapon system and how pleased you are to show it
        off.
        A3.14.3.5.5. (Added-AFGSC) Don’t discuss something that is not in your lane
        (area of responsibility)
  A3.14.4. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC/PAC Points of Contact. All questions outside the
  scope of this guidance should be referred to AFGSC/PAC by calling AFGSC Public Affairs
  at (318) 456-7844 or after hours through the Command Post at (318) 456-2151.

              AFGSC FLYOVER POLICY AND REQUEST PROCEDURES

A4.1. (AFGSC) Flyover Requests. Submit Wing/CC (or his designated representative)-
approved flyover request to HQ AFGSC/A3B IAW the timing criteria in paragraph A4.9 (as
supplemented) below. HQ AFGSC/A3B will coordinate all UH-1N requests with
AFGSC/A3TH. AFGSC/A3BA will make avialable all known AFGSC Aerial Events on the
AFGSC/A3 Staff Meeting Slides (slides 04U and 04U2) at:
https://afgsc-p.eis.af.mil/internal/a3-5/Staff%20Meeting%20Slide%20Library/Forms/AllI
tems.aspx Requests submitted inside 7 workdays may be disapproved for insufficient time to
process. Late requests must include OG/CC letter explaining the reason. For off-base flyover
requests, sponsors must have a SAF/PA or HQ AFGSC/PA-approved (as applicable) DD Form
2535, Request for Military Aerial Support, before the request can be approved by HQ AFGSC.
   A4.1.1. (AFGSC) Safety is Paramount. Ensure that all fly-by, airshow and aerial
   demonstration aircrews have reviewed all regulations/instructions applicable to tasked
   events. Further it is important that they completely understand the basis for these
   restrictions, many of which have been written after the loss of fellow aviators or aircraft.
   Responsibility for this personal oversight is a leadership task that can be delegated no lower
   than the Operations Group Commander level. Aircrews will review Attachment 8 checklist,
   where applicable, before all formation flyovers.
A4.2. (AFGSC) Flyover Request Format. Submit Wing/CC request using the following
format:
   A4.2.1. (AFGSC) Event: (Event title, should match DD Form 2535).
   A4.2.2. (AFGSC) Where: (Event location, city/base/location and state or country [identify
   exact flyover location]).
   A4.2.3. (AFGSC) When: (Date).
   A4.2.4. (AFGSC) TOT: (Hard or soft, time in Zulu or local time zone or TBD).
   A4.2.5. (AFGSC) Control: (ACT, GLO, air boss, tower, etc.).
   A4.2.6. (AFGSC) Aircraft: (Number and MDS).
   A4.2.7. (AFGSC) Flyover Profile: Profile #1 thru #6; type of formation [if applicable];
   speed KIAS and altitude in AGL.
   A4.2.8. (AFGSC) Other Aircraft Participating in the Event: (Number, MDS, and MAJCOM
   [if non-AFGSC]).
   A4.2.9. (AFGSC) Required Waivers/Additional Approval: (HQ AFGSC/A3 waiver if
   required; FAA waiver approval [if required]; SAF/PA or HQ AFGSC/PA approval [if
   required]).
   A4.2.10. (AFGSC) POC: (Rank or title, name, unit/office, phone and/or fax number and/or
   e-mail address).
A4.3. (AFGSC) Flyover Profiles. When submitting your request, choose one of the six
profiles below. Note: For airshows profiles 1-6 are authorized and for all other flyovers only
 56                                           AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012


profiles 1 & 2 are authorized (see Attachment 7 for visual depiction of profiles 1-6). Identify the
exact flyover point such as runway, stadium, etc. For complex aerial events such as aerial
reviews or capabilities demonstrations, describe the proposed flyover profile in detail: for
example, specify holding, timing/de-confliction for a multiple aircraft flyover, formation
procedures if non-standard, timeline of events for complex demonstrations/flyovers,
contingencies, etc. AFGSC UH-1Ns will fly the Flyover profiles at or below 100 knots. Aerial
demonstrations will be flown per MDS specific guidance.
   A4.3.1. (AFGSC) Profile 1. Normal pass; clean configuration (i.e., gear and flaps
   retracted); normal traffic pattern airspeed for overhead pattern initial or, for aircraft that do
   not have a defined overhead pattern initial airspeed, normal downwind airspeed.
   A4.3.2. (AFGSC) Profile 2. High speed pass; clean configuration (i.e., gear and flaps
   retracted) at no more than 450 KIAS or tech order maximum allowable airspeed, whichever
   is less (ensure FAA waiver has been obtained for any airspeed in excess of 250 KIAS.).
   A4.3.3. (AFGSC) Profile 3. Arcing pass: Profile begins with an approach from the rear
   quarter of the viewing audience at 200 to 250 KIAS. The approach is offset from the runway
   or show centerline by 30 degrees. Approaching show center, execute a turn to the ―crowd
   side‖ and track outbound 30 degrees off runway or show centerline so as to scribe an arc
   around the crowd.
   A4.3.4. (AFGSC) Profile 4. Tear Drop Maneuver: Profile begins as a Profile 1 pass along
   the show line. Upon completion of the pass, track outbound approximately 1 nautical mile
   then execute a 240 degree turn away from the show line (rolling out momentarily at 90
   degrees to the show line for clearing) so as to roll out directed towards show center tracking
   30 degrees off runway or show centerline. At show center accomplish a turn away from show
   center (coming no closer than 1000 feet from the crowd line) and track outbound
   approximately 30 degrees off runway or show centerline.
   A4.3.5. (AFGSC) Profile 5. 360 Degree (Box Pattern). Profile consists of a straight and
   level, clean configuration pass over the runway at 200 to 250 KIAS based on aircraft gross
   weight. Following the straight thru pass, execute a turn away from the crowd line and fly a
   rectangular box pattern to a second straight and level pass (roll out momentarily at
   perpendicular headings to the show line for clearing).
   A4.3.6. (AFGSC) Profile 6. Figure 8 Maneuver. The figure 8 profile begins with an
   approach from the rear quarter of the viewing audience at 250 KIAS. The approach is offset
   from runway or show centerline by 30 degrees. Approaching show center, execute a turn to
   the ―crowd side‖ of the runway and track outbound 30 degrees off runway or show centerline
   so as to scribe an arc around the crowd. Upon completion of the outbound turn, track
   outbound and execute a 240 degree turn in the opposite direction (rolling out momentarily at
   90 degrees to the show line for clearing) pointing towards show center tracking 30 degrees
   off runway or show centerline. At show center, accomplish a turn away from show center
   and track outbound 30 degrees off runway or show centerline. Upon completion of the
   outbound turn, track outbound and execute a 240 degree turn in the opposite direction
   (rolling out momentarily at 90 degrees to the show line for clearing). Purposely overshoot
   final and establish a 30 degree offset from the runway or show centerline to again approach
   from the rear quarter of the audience. At show center, execute a climbing turn (at MCM) at
   40 degrees of bank toward the crowd side of the runway. If obstructions and crowd overflight
AFI11-209_AFGSCSUP_I 16 FEBRUARY 2012                                                          57


   concerns prevent this exact ground track, mission planners will adjust the profile to perform a
   safe flyover in the general form of the figure 8 pattern.
A4.4. (AFGSC) Flyover Guidance. Flyovers will comply with the following guidance:
   A4.4.1. (AFGSC) The maximum number of passes is three. The WG/CC (may be delegated
   to OG/CC) will approve which profiles will be flown at each event.
   A4.4.2. (AFGSC) Execute turns to fly no closer than 1000 feet from the crowd line.
   A4.4.3. (AFGSC) All bank angles will be planned for 30 (not to exceed 45) degrees.
A4.5. (AFGSC) Flyover minimum altitude: see 1.6.3.1.3. (Added).
A4.6. (AFGSC) Formations. Four-ship maximum in fingertip or route formation for T-38 and
UH-1N aircraft.
A4.7. (AFGSC) Requests for On-Base Flyovers. All requests for on-base flyovers not over the
runwaymust be accompanied by a map (Falcon View or like product) depicting the route of
flight over the base with reference to local base population (i.e., housing areas, officer and
enlisted clubs, BX, commissary, etc.). These maps must be of sufficient detail to show the
flyover avoids base population to the maximum extent possible.
A4.8. (AFGSC) Exceptions. Exceptions to above procedures, profiles, and parameters require
specific HQ AFGSC/ A3 (or higher) approval.
A4.9. (AFGSC) Request submission timelines:
   A4.9.1. (AFGSC) Flyovers: NLT 7 duty days (requests inside 7 days require OG/CC late
   letter)
   A4.9.2. (AFGSC) Memorial Flyover: NLT 7 duty days or when notified
   A4.9.3. (AFGSC) Aircraft Demonstration: NLT 10 duty days
   A4.9.4. (AFGSC) Aerial Review (AFGSC assets): NLT 10 duty days
   A4.9.5. (AFGSC) Aerial Review (Multi Command or Service): NLT 14 duty days
   NOTE: Requests inside established guidelines require an OG/CC late letter.

                          B-2 AERIAL EVENTS SCHEDULING

A5.1. (AFGSC) Scheduling. B-2 participation in aerial events will be closely monitored and
scrutinized by HQ AFGSC. The following guidelines will be used to schedule B-2 aircraft for
flyover and static display participation:
   A5.1.1. (AFGSC) HQ AFGSC/A3BA is the central point of contact for weekend (defined
   as Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays), OCONUS, high visibility, and senior staff
   (AFGSC, HQ USAF, or political) requests.
      A5.1.1.1. (AFGSC) Participation requests will arrive to AFGSC/A3BA NLT 1 month
      prior to the event. For example, requests must be received by 1 July for events to be
      scheduled in August.
          A5.1.1.1.1. (AFGSC) AFGSC/A3BA will coordinate the draft schedule with 509
          BW/CC, AFGSC/PA and AFGSC/A5RZ prior to schedule publication.
          A5.1.1.1.2. (AFGSC) AFGSC/A5RZ will analyze each location for intelligence risk
          levels and recommend support/non-support or modification of support profiles (i.e.
          fighter escort during B-2 OCONUS flyovers).
      A5.1.1.2. (AFGSC) AFGSC/A3BA will attempt to publish an AFGSC/A3 approved
      schedule NLT 15 days prior to the start of the scheduled month on the AFGSC/A3 Staff
      Meeting Slides (slides 04U and 04U2) at:
      https://afgsc-p.eis.af.mil/internal/a3-5/Staff%20Meeting%20Slide%20Library/
      Forms/AllItems.aspx
   A5.1.2. (AFGSC) 509 OSS/OSOS is the central point of contact for all other participation
   requests. Events or agencies will forward requests for events not listed in A5.1.1 (Added) to
   509 OGS/OGS (email: B2flyby@whiteman.af.mil ).
      A5.1.2.1. (AFGSC) 509 BW requests for weekday and other events will arrive at
      AFGSC/A3BA NLT 15 duty days prior to the event. AFGSC/A3BA will publish an
      updated B-2 schedule once approved by AFGSC/A3.
   A5.1.3. (AFGSC) The 509 BW will support no more than one air show weekend day
   November through March and two airshow weekend days April through October. HQ
   AFGSC/A3BA will attempt to group flyovers to serve multiple locations with a single sortie
   and minimize training impact in conjunction with air- show and open house support.
      A5.1.3.1. (AFGSC) There is no limit to weekday event participation, provided impact
      on daily training missions is minimized.
   A5.1.4. (AFGSC) Annual/quarterly scheduled events such as Air University Aerospace
   Power Demonstration, and Joint Expeditionary Force Experiment (JEFX) will not count
   towards the monthly airshow support. Every attempt will be made to prevent combining
   airshows/open houses with these events.
   A5.1.5. (AFGSC) The 509 BW reserves the right to cancel a previously scheduled event
   when short notice HHQ request/tasking pushes the wing over its maximum number of air
   show weekend days in a given month.

                           UN-1N AERIAL EVENT SPECIFICS

A7.1. (AFGSC) Aerial Demonstrations.
   A7.1.1. (AFGSC) In order to participate in an aerial demonstration, an operations director,
   air operations manager, air boss, or similar individual will be in place to coordinate flight
   operations.
   A7.1.2. (AFGSC) All demonstrations will be performed over a runway or open area
   (taxiway, grass infield, etc.) at a military or civilian airfield, or over an open area not
   associated with an airfield that meets USAF/FAA requirements for a helicopter landing site
   or flight demonstration site.
   A7.1.3. (AFGSC) All profiles involving Alternate Insertion/Extractions (AIE) may include
   actual insertion and extraction of qualified personnel. Authorized AIEs are those listed in
   AFI 11-2H-1, Vol 3, Helicopter Operations, and MAJCOM supplements. They will be
   performed at an altitude consistent with the unit's mission and governing directives.
A7.2. (AFGSC) Demonstration Profiles:
   A7.2.1. (AFGSC) Profile 1 is an aircraft capabilities demonstration highlighting a steep
   approach to landing (optional maneuvers include a hover or AIE demonstration) followed by
   a maximum performance takeoff and departure. As a guide, the hover demonstration is
   performed at approximately four feet and may include a 180o turn about the transmission, a
   180o turn about the nose and a 360o turn about the tail (all with a maximum turn rate of 90
   degrees in four seconds).
   A7.2.2. (AFGSC) Profile 2 is flown as a single-ship or a formation. The size and
   composition of the formation will be similar to that required by the unit's typical operational
   or training mission profile. The aircraft or formation approaches the landing area low-level at
   90 KIAS. The crew performs a tactical approach and quick-stop maneuver, followed by a
   landing or AIE demonstration. After the landing or AIE is complete, the aircrew egresses the
   area with a tactical departure.
