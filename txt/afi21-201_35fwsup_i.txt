                     GENERAL CONVENTIONAL MUNITIONS POLICY

Part I of this instruction implements general conventional munitions policy relevant to all munitions
managing, using, and possessing activities regardless of organizational level and whether at home
station or deployed. It provides the framework for munitions transformation, compliance,
conventions, reach back support, issue resolution, customer relationship management, and report
licensing exclusions.

                                           Chapter 1

                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. Munitions Transformation:
   1.1.1. The Air Force munitions community operates in an environment that fosters
   Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) to continuously focus on logistics transformation.
   1.1.2. Transformation of munitions processes and policy is a continuous and iterative effort.
   The Air Force Maintenance Advisory Group (AFMAG) serves as the governing body for Air
   Force Maintenance for the 21st Century (AFMx21) and the strategic planning process to
   achieve Air Force Enterprise Logistics for the 21st Century (eLog21) transformational goals.
      1.1.2.1. Specific goals and tasks are outlined in detail within the AFMx21 Strategic and
      Implementation Plans. These documents can be obtained on the AF/A4LX AFKN CoP.
      1.1.2.2. Commanders, managers, and supervisors within munitions organizations have a
      direct stake in the content of the AFMx21 Strategic and Implementation Plans. All
      Munitions supervisors and technicians should be made aware of these documents and
      review them periodically. Submit proposed changes to the AFMx21 Strategic Plan and
      Implementation Plan through command channels.
1.2. Deviations and Waivers. Units shall notify the Lead MAJCOM (see Table 8.1.) and info
the parent Numbered Air Force (NAF) and MAJCOM of conflicts in guidance and submit
technical improvement reports when appropriate. MAJCOMs provide direction for small and
unique organizations (see AFI 21-200, Munitions and Missile Maintenance Management) when
resource or contract limitations prevent compliance with this AFI.
   1.2.1. Deviations are permanent departures from standards and do not require periodic
   resubmission. Lead MAJCOMs will review and validate all approved deviations annually.
   1.2.2. Waivers provide a temporary grace period for units unable to immediately comply
   with existing guidance. Waivers must be resubmitted annually for re-approval.
   1.2.3. Unless specific exception is provided in this instruction, AF/A4L is the approval
   authority for all deviation or waiver requests to Air Force Munitions policy.
   1.2.4. The Maintenance Group Commander (MXG) or equivalent will sign all deviation or
   waiver requests initiated at the unit level. Active duty units submit requests through the Lead
   MAJCOM (info Component Numbered Air Force (C-NAF) and parent MAJCOM). Reserve
   and Guard units submit requests to HQ Air Force Reserve Center (AFRC) or National Guard
   Bureau (NGB). If the Lead MAJCOM, AFRC, or NGB concurs, forward to AF/A4LW for
   review and approval/disapproval.
      1.2.4.1. Deviations/waivers that do not affect policy or organizational structure will be
      submitted for approval through their parent MAJCOM.
      1.2.4.2. MAJCOM approved physical or functional consolidation of activities IAW AFI
      21-200 are not considered deviation/waiver situations/conditions.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                              11


       1.2.4.3. Parent MAJCOMs will forward all MAJCOM approved deviations/waivers to
       AF/A4LW to assess potential policy impacts. All deviations and waiver requests shall
       include:
          1.2.4.3.1. A justification statement.
          1.2.4.3.2. Duration and the anticipated date of compliance.
          1.2.4.3.3. Munitions facilities numbers involved.
          1.2.4.3.4. Mission impacts or risks assumed by non-compliance with policy.
          1.2.4.3.5. Proposed workarounds or alternative methods to comply with policy.
          1.2.4.3.6. Information helpful in the evaluation of deviation or waiver requests.
   1.2.5. Test or trial programs on munitions items that deviate from munitions specific
   technical orders or procedures require Lead MAJCOM and Program/Engineering/Technical
   authority approval.
   1.2.6. Test or trial programs that deviate from munitions policy require Lead MAJCOM (or
   AFRC and NGB) and AF/A4LW approval. Refer to applicable 00-series T.Os and
   applicable 21-series instructions for routing, approval authorities and further guidance.
1.3. Compliance Terminology. For the purposes of this instruction, the following definitions
apply:
   1.3.1. Shall, Must, Will: Indicates a mandatory requirement. (Will is also used to express a
   declaration of purpose for a future event.)
   1.3.2. Should: Indicates a preferred method of accomplishment.

          owning activity ( Certified welding, complete floor replacement, etc.)
          3.4.3.1.2. Maximum one-time-repair will not exceed criteria provided in T.O. 35-1-
          25, Economic Repair Criteria for Support Equipment. When repair cost exceeds T.O.
          35-1-25 limits, units will request disposition instructions from GACP using the CRM.
      3.4.3.2. Containers will not be used to store equipment or materials (e.g.: liquids, acids,
      batteries, etc.) that would render them non-certifiable under the CSC.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                              29


     3.4.3.3. Holes will not be made in any part of a container. Blocking and bracing must be
     accomplished IAW applicable Defense Ammunition Center (DAC) drawings. The
     drawings are available at the DAC website: https://www3.dac.army.mil/.
     3.4.3.4. Containers are designed to support their weight and that of their contents through
     bottom corner castings. When removed from a chassis, place containers on drained,
     hardstand surfaces with all four lower castings placed on blocks (dunnage) 4 to 6 inches
     high. This prevents rocks and debris from exerting pressure against lower structural
     members of the container and allows air circulation that will prevent moisture damage to
     the container. Containers may be temporarily placed directly on a paved hardstand for
     stuffing and unstuffing operations.
         3.4.3.4.1. Empty containers will not be stacked more than three high. A minimum of
         two stacking/locking pins will be inserted in the counter-checked position on
         opposing corners when containers are stacked.
         3.4.3.4.2. Once containers have been inspected and verified empty, a numbered type
         cargo seal will be placed on each container to provide for security, integrity, and
         accountability.
     3.4.3.5. CSC Inspection: Performed by certified CSC inspectors IAW MIL-HDBK-
     138B, Container Inspection Handbook for Commercial and Military Inter-modal
     Containers. For containers that pass inspection, apply a new DD Form 2282, Inspection
     Decal Convention for Safe Containers.
         3.4.3.5.1. Document the inspection using DA Form 2404, Equipment Inspection and
         Maintenance Worksheet. Units maintain CSC inspection documentation (5-year, 30-
         month, and after-repair). Original signed documentation must identify who
         performed the last CSC inspection and will be readily available upon request by
         Transportation/Coast Guard officials.
         3.4.3.5.2. Input required information for each container in the ISO Management tab
         in MC2 Sharepoint and attach the completed DA Form 2404 and Inspection Checklist
         for each ISO.
         3.4.3.5.3. The DAC conducts the in-resident CSC certification course. The distance
         learning course (Ammo-43-DL) is also available on the DAC website and is
         authorized for CSC initial and refresher training/certification for Air Force personnel.
  3.4.4. Account for USAF owned containers in CAS using NSN 8140-01-296-7241NM and
  appropriate CC. Containers will be entered in CAS by Serial Number (SN) as the lot number
  (i.e., USAF0018745, excluding any dashes on data plate). CAS will be used to track CSC
  due dates. USAF owned ISO containers will only be placed in CC-A, -B, -E, -F, -G, -H or -J.
     3.4.4.1. APF ISO containers are entered in CAS by SN as the lot number using a
     ―USFU‖ prefix and are all side-opening containers, tan in color. Forward APF container
     SNs and condition to APF management team personnel via e-mail to:
     505cbss.apf@hill.af.mil. APF management personnel will verify SNs to ensure
     containers belong to the program. After SN validation, the APF management team will
     provide repair or disposition instructions.
     3.4.4.2. Ship ISO Containers IAW paragraph 7.14.6, ISO Container shipments.

3.5. Munitions Equipment Management.
   3.5.1. IMDS/G081 will be used in the munitions organization to manage inspection
   intervals, maintenance and inspection history, condition/status, and work performed on
   material handling equipment (MHE), munitions and miscellaneous SE, MTS, associated
   handling equipment (e.g., slings, hoists) as defined in T.O. 00-20-1.
      3.5.1.1. In addition to documentation requirements of T.O. 00-20-1, units will ensure
      IMDS/G081 is updated as gains, losses, maintenance and TCTO actions occur.
      3.5.1.2. The T.O. 00-20-1 definition of SE includes any of the following munitions SE
      items: Powered and non-powered aerospace ground equipment (AGE) (i.e., MOLTS);
      industrial plant equipment (IPE) (i.e., bench grinders, table saws); vehicular SE (i.e.,
      snow plow attachments); Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE);
      nuclear, conventional, and chemical munitions handling and test equipment (i.e., Missile
      Test Sets (MTS)); test equipment (i.e., ohmmeters/voltmeters); and special tools
      requiring scheduled inspections (i.e., hoists, slings, stands). Specific SE terms are defined
      in T.O. 00-20-1, Appendix A.
      3.5.1.3. Muntions Material Handling Equipemnt (MMHE) is powered or non-powered
      equipment specifically designed to interface with and/or support munitions shipping,
      storing, assembly/ disassembly, transporting, loading, unloading operations. MMHE must
      be certified by either the nuclear or non-nuclear certification board. Nuclear certified
      items are certified for non-nuclear use.
      3.5.1.4. Locally Manufactured Equipment (LME) used to interface or support munitions
      such as tools, handling dollies, storage racks, maintenance stands, transport adapters, etc.
      will be approved, coordinated, managed, and inspected IAW AFI 21-101. Munitions
      LME must meet applicable AFOSH and AFMAN 91-201 explosive safety requirements,
      and must meet AFI 91-103, AF Nuclear Safety Certification Program requirements if
      used for nuclear weapons handling or maintenance.
      3.5.1.5. Materiel Handling Equipment (MHE) is powered or non-powered handling
      equipment designed for general industrial shipping, storage, transporting loading or
      unloading operations of material. These items are generally available from commercial
      sources.
      3.5.1.6. Other common items with inspection or maintenance requirements may be
      managed/tracked in MC2 SharePoint.
   3.5.2. Refer to T.O. 35D-1-2-CD-1, Munitions Material Handling and Support Equipment
   (Miscellaneous and Locally Manufactured) for maintenance, inspection, and servicing
   requirements for equipment items not identified in other specific item T.O.‘s.
   3.5.3. Support equipment without a listed Standard Reporting Designator (SRD) may load
   SRD ―GAZ‖ for ―Not Otherwise SRD Listed support equipment.‖
   3.5.4. The Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS) is the source for allowances
   source codes for all MMHE, MTS, and associated support equipment. Equipment custodians
   will maintain an AFEMS password.
      3.5.4.1. Equipment custodians will ensure their Custodian Authorization/Custody
      Receipt Listing (CA/CRL) accurately reflect proper authorization IAW AFEMS,
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                              31


      Automated Test Systems (ATS) are entered into AFEMS by SN. Failure to reconcile
      discrepancies could result in the inability to order, replace, and mobilize munitions
      equipment. When equipment is moved, custodians coordinate with LRS to ensure it is
      appropriately transferred (1ET) or deployed (1ED) in SBSS/AFEMS.
          3.5.4.1.1. ‗Transfer‘ accountability of equipment when movement is to a location
          with an established Expeditionary Logistics Readiness Squadron (ELRS) or host
          supply account at the gaining location.
          3.5.4.1.2. ‗Deploy‘ equipment when the gaining location has no ELRS or host supply
          account, when movement is part of a peacetime exercise or training deployment.
      3.5.4.2. Contact the Equipment Liaison Office (ELO) or the Lead MAJCOM munitions
      staff to resolve account discrepancies. Air Reserve Component (ARC) units work
      through the HQ AFRC/NGB munitions staff for equipment issues. HQ AFRC/NGB will
      notify the ELO and should notify the appropriate Lead MAJCOM munitions staff.
3.6. Munitions Security.
   3.6.1. Risk Categories: Risk Categories and munitions storage and facility security criteria
   are IAW DOD 5100.76-M and AFI 31-101, or Lead MAJCOM supplemental guidance to
   AFI 31-101.
   3.6.2. General Guidance for Protecting Munitions Information: There are many types of
   munitions information that is useful to a potential enemy. Munitions data relating to specific
   plans, operations, and weapons system, requirements within the Non-nuclear Consumable
   Annual Analysis (NCAA) and War Consumable Distribution Objection (WCDO) processes
   could be damaging to national security. The fact that this instruction identifies certain
   information as unclassified does not authorize automatic release of information. To have
   access to classified munitions information, one must have a security clearance at the
   appropriate level, a signed SF 312, Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement, and the
   need-to-know.
      3.6.2.1. Release of Munitions Information to the Public or Foreign Entities.
          3.6.2.1.1. Public release of information. Public release of sensitive but unclassified
          (SBU) munitions information requires prior approval. Such information includes
          conversation, oral statement, speeches, articles, photographs, brochures,
          advertisements, displays, presentations, etc. Send proposed public disclosure, in
          writing, to the installation, major command, Air Logistics Center, or Air Staff Public
          Affairs (PA) office for approval. Contractors, manufacturers and other government
          agencies are responsible for screening SBU munitions information submitted for
          release approval to ensure it is unclassified, technically accurate, and suitable for
          open publication. These activities are also responsible for written certification that
          the above criteria are met.
          3.6.2.1.2. Visits from public media representatives. Visits by public media shall be
          coordinated with PA and public release of any information officially approved by PA
          before disclosure.
          3.6.2.1.3. Release of Classified or Unclassified Information to Foreign Entities. Any
          government or commercial agent receiving a request for release of conventional
32                                                  AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


         munitions information to a foreign government or individual must obtain approval.
         Approval may be obtained from the OPR of this AFI, applicable OPR weapons
         specific security classification guide or obtain an export license from the Department
         of State, Office of Defense Trade Control, PM/DTC, Washington DC 20522.
     3.6.2.2. Classification Challenges. Individuals who believe munitions information is
     inappropriately classified are expected to challenge the classification. Individuals should
     bring classification challenges and concerns to the attention of their security manager or
     the Original Classification Authority (OCA).
  3.6.3. How Munitions Information Classification is Determined: The rules expressed in
  Executive Order (E.O.) 12958 mandate that the OCA explicitly determines whether the
  unauthorized disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to result in damage
  to national security. The OCA must be able to identify and describe the damage. Munitions
  Information Classification Rules listed in Table 3.1 does not address all possible
  combinations of information, but serves as a guide.
     3.6.3.1. Refer to individual security classification guides for weapon-specific guidance.
     Weapon-specific security classification guides take precedence over this AFI. These
     guides are posted on the 784 CBSG website through the AF portal and DOD 5200.1-R,
     Information Security Program. Coordinate weapons-specific security classification
     guides affecting munitions or missile systems or their end-items with AF/A4LW and
     AF/A5RC prior to publication or update. The Program Manager (PM) is responsible to
     keep Security Classification Guides current and posted on the GACP website.
     3.6.3.2. Three primary terms are used in munitions classification determination. Proper
     use of these terms will avoid unnecessary classification:
         3.6.3.2.1. Requirements. The NCAA and Tactical Air Missile Program (TAMP)
         documents calculate requirements for munitions to support unified commander
         missions under the methodology in DODI 3000.4, DOD Munitions Requirements
         Process (DOD MRP). The WCDO indicates the by base distribution of the NCAA
         and TAMP Theater CTR data. Requirements are normally classified by the OCA
         using the logic rules outlined in the Tables 3.2 and 3.3.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                                   33

3.8. Munitions Training Programs.
    3.8.1. General Training Requirements: Effective training programs in peacetime are critical
    to meeting Expeditionary Air Force (EAF) and surge combat requirements. Munitions
    managers and supervisors at all levels establish and implement training and qualification
    programs to enable technicians to proficiently perform assigned contingency and routine
    munitions systems tasks. Training focuses on management of assigned programs and
    qualification of supervisors and technicians to execute effective control, accountability,
    storage, receipt, shipment, inspection, maintenance, assembly, flightline expediting, flightline
    delivery, and limited local disposition of conventional, precision guided, nuclear munitions
    and associated components.

        Ammunition System operations, processing procedure, operation of Automatic
        Identification Technology (AIT) equipment, and TMRS as applicable throughout the
        range of munitions operations. When developing local training programs, maximize use
        of the Munitions Accountability Procedures Guide located on the AF/A4LW AFKN CoP.
        3.8.1.2. Munitions qualification training will focus on checkout, operation and
        organizational level maintenance of assigned munitions tools, test, and handling
        equipment.
    3.8.2. Combat Munitions Training (CMT) Program.
        3.8.2.1. Munitions Supervision is responsible for establishing and implementing an
        effective CMT program and directs the Training Section/Element NCOIC in all stages of
        program development.         The CMT program is designed to provide hands-on
        familiarization training to develop core knowledge for all 2W0XX and company grade
        officers assigned to the MUNS/Munitions Flight and will include all facets of the unit‘s
        conventional munitions contingency or OPLAN tasking (in-place or deployed). CMT is
        not intended to fully qualify personnel in all tasks. CMT programs should attempt to
        develop cross-functionality in the use of personnel to the maximum extent possible. For
        senior leaders in the unit (SMSgt, CMSgt, and Capt), CMT participation should focus on
        leadership, mentorship, hands-on review and adaptation of the CMT curriculum at the
        point of instruction.
        3.8.2.2. The MUNS Superintendent/Flight Chief establish the number of personnel (total
        number or percentage of assigned) required to train on each contingency task to meet the
        unit's most demanding contingency requirements. In determining this, consider the
        highest probable usage of tasked munitions, criticality of supporting tasks, complexity of
        tasks performed, and the need for flexibility in the use of personnel.
            3.8.2.2.1. Develop a task-training list used to manage training for all contingency
            operations. The task-training list will identify the task to be instructed and the
            required interval (not to exceed a maximum of 18 months). Consider task
36                                                 AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


        complexity, frequency, duration, and ease of scheduling when determining the
        frequency of training.
        3.8.2.2.2. The unit's conventional munitions contingency or OPLAN tasking (in-
        place or deployed) has primary emphasis in the CMT program (e.g., munitions
        production, outload, depot support), however, supporting tasks are equally critical.
        Therefore the MUNS Superintendent/Flight Chief may designate personnel that only
        require CMT training on supporting tasks as identified on the task-training list. Use
        the UCML, weapons task qualification listing, integrated tasking order (ITO),
        collateral mission, aircrew training syllabus, OPLANs, Munitions Employment Plan
        (MEP), and base support plans to determine the scope of the training program.
        3.8.2.2.3. ARC unit CMT programs are separate and distinct training programs,
        however ARC units should collaborate with their gaining commands/units to
        maximize the effectiveness of their CMT program. Total Force Integration (TFI)
        units should develop and maintain a single consolidated CMT program on each
        installation.
     3.8.2.3. All 2W0XX personnel assigned outside the Munitions Squadron/Flight will
     attend CMT at intervals designated by the MUNS Superintendent/Flight Chief to
     maintain familiarization on core munitions tasks and meet combat training requirements
     of the 2W0X1 Munitions Systems Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP)
     and training outlined by the Munitions Superintendent/Flight Chief in the Master Task
     Listing (MTL). This may only be waived by the individual‘s Squadron Commander (or
     equivalent) for documented medical reasons.
     3.8.2.4. Exemptions from CMT requirements:
        3.8.2.4.1. Short-tour assignment locations when each member of the munitions
        organization receives a documented initial OPLAN briefing. Maintain OPLAN
        briefing documentation until personnel PCS.
        3.8.2.4.2. Research, Test, and Development (RT&D) units when the base of
        assignment lacks sufficient resources to mount an effective program. Note: RT&D
        units co-located on installations with other operational or training units (e.g., ACC
        Fighter/Bomber, AETC Fighter/Bomber training) are required to complete CMT
        training with the co-located unit. The flight chief is responsible to coordinate and
        schedule CMT with the other unit.
     3.8.2.5. The MUNS Superintendent/Flight Chief may use their discretion to certify
     completion of CMT training requirements for individuals when they can positively
     establish through training records or other deployed documentation that training received
     while deployed to an established contingency location satisfies CMT requirements
     identified for an individual or assigned duty section.
     3.8.2.6. The CMT program will include comprehensive training covering all aspects of
     accountability operations and CAS processes integral to each task or process. CMT
     training outlines will include CAS tasks and processes to promote standardization.
     During training, utilize standard CAS screens and CAS help screens to promote
     proficiency in CAS transaction processing. CAS access will be controlled and monitored
     by System Administrators (SA) until training is complete and documented.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                           37


     3.8.2.7. Develops CMT training outlines which are reviewed by Munitions Supervision
     only after review and coordination by Wing Safety for ground and weapons safety
     adequacy and Quality Assurance for technical accuracy.
        3.8.2.7.1. Training outlines will contain as a minimum:
            3.8.2.7.1.1. Training Title.
            3.8.2.7.1.2. Training objectives.
            3.8.2.7.1.3. Student Instructional Material.
            3.8.2.7.1.4. Training resources.
            3.8.2.7.1.5. Instructional method.
            3.8.2.7.1.6. Instructional guidance.
        3.8.2.7.2. Close coordination with the local logistics/maintenance training flight is
        required when developing course curriculum and training outlines. Refer to AFMAN
        36-2234, Instructional Systems Development.
     3.8.2.8. All personnel will receive In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Plan (IGESP),
     Expeditionary Site Plan (ESP), and MEP (if applicable) training on their portion of these
     plans during CMT training.
     3.8.2.9. CMT instructors will be designated in writing and will be CFETP qualified and
     technically proficient on all instructional tasks. CMT instructors may be assigned to the
     Munitions Training Element or other sections/elements.
     3.8.2.10. CMT is scheduled and conducted according to the following guidelines:
        3.8.2.10.1. Initial CMT academic training should normally be completed before
        practical training. Training must include:
            3.8.2.10.1.1. Instruction in tasks required to accomplish the unit's IGESP, ESP,
            and MEP (if applicable) during transition to conflict.
            3.8.2.10.1.2. All safety devices, features and hazards of the work environment
            IAWAFMAN 91-201 and applicable item technical orders.
            3.8.2.10.1.3. Identification and description of components IAW the applicable
            item technical order.
            3.8.2.10.1.4. Review of abbreviated inspection tasks and rapid assembly of
            components IAW T.O. 11A-1-63 and/or the specific item technical order (-63 are
            preferred).
            3.8.2.10.1.5. Review of vehicle, AGE, SE, MMHE, TMDE, test set, and special
            tool specification, use, and operational maintenance requirements for each type
            build/operating locations.
            3.8.2.10.1.6. Review of requirements and procedures for munitions security and
            storage.
        3.8.2.10.2. Practical training normally begins when academic training is complete.
        Practical training is administered by qualified and appointed CMT Instructors.

         Conduct CMT in facilities or training areas usually dedicated to the munitions
         assembly or support operation being instructed and will include:
            3.8.2.10.2.1. Use of facilities large enough to accommodate required training and
            associated SE.
            3.8.2.10.2.2. Use of a practical training area with adequate office space and an
            academic classroom with appropriate heating and cooling.
            3.8.2.10.2.3. Maximum duplication of realistic operating conditions to enhance
            training. Additional munitions practical training considerations for munitions
            include:
                3.8.2.10.2.3.1. Familiarity with munitions serviceability criteria. Do not
                allow blanket rejection of training munitions during training operations solely
                because they are inert.
                3.8.2.10.2.3.2. Familiarity with the operation of all available MMHE, AGE
                and SE used during operations. Pay particular attention to equipment not used
                on a routine basis. This training focuses on handling, utilization, loading
                procedures to include loading in/out of containers.
                3.8.2.10.2.3.3. The training must emphasize set-up for mass assembly and
                innovate production techniques and organization (i.e., using Munitions
                Assembly Conveyor (MAC), trailer builds, dunnage builds, etc.) use of power
                tools and on-the-spot maintenance procedures (i.e., use of thread chasers,
                alignment devices, etc.). As a minimum, this phase includes:
                  3.8.2.10.2.3.3.1. Physical inspection of components according to T.O. 11A-
                  1-63 or specific item T.O. (use 11A-1-63 when procedures are included).
                  3.8.2.10.2.3.3.2. Use of inert components for this training is recommended.
                  If inert components are not available, live munitions may be used provided
                  serviceability is not jeopardized and technical data or MAJCOM does not
                  prohibit use.
                3.8.2.10.2.3.4. Units with an alternate mission as specified in an approved
                Organizational Mission Directive (OMD) (i.e., TARRP) will ensure training
                reflects applicable tasks.
     3.8.2.11. Units will use IMDS/G081 to track CMT.
  3.8.3. Munitions Inspector Training:
     3.8.3.1. Any 2W051, 2W071 or 2W091 munitions technician/supervisor may be trained,
     qualified, and appointed as a Munitions Inspector at the discretion of the Munitions Flight
     Chief if they have completed Munitions Inspector Training and Certification using the
     USAF Qualification Training Package (AFQTP) for Munitions Inspector Training and
     Certification located on the A4LW AFKN CoP and any local requirements (e.g., Senior
     Inspector Assessment, Quality Assurance evaluations, etc.).
         3.8.3.1.1. Units may include an addendum to the munitions inspector AFQTP to
         address local inspector requirements or processes, however, the basic AFQTP will not
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                               39


          be changed or deviated from without approval of the 2W0X1 Air Force Career Field
          Manager (AFCFM).
          3.8.3.1.2. Submit proposed changes to the munitions inspector AFQTP through their
          Lead MAJCOM to the 2W0X1 AFCFM for approval prior to implementation.
      3.8.3.2. Quality Assurance Specialists (Ammunition Surveillance) with a GS-1910 series
      rating, and contractors or civil service personnel filling munitions inspectors‘ positions
      may also be appointed as a Munitions Inspector, provided they meet the training,
      qualification and appointment criteria of paragraph 3.8.3.1 and possess at least four years
      experience in an ordnance or munitions career field/job series/position (e.g., civilian
      munitions worker, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), Naval/Army/USMC Ordnance,
      Aircraft Armament, Nuclear/ICBM Munitions).
      3.8.3.3. Document certification in the Training Business Area (TBA) (ITP journal entry),
      AF IMT 623A, AF IMT 1098, IMDS/G081, or other suitable documentation,
      standardized across the unit.
      3.7.3.4. Utilize a ―Train-the-Trainer‖ concept to locally train and certify munitions
      inspectors. Munitions inspector trainers must be qualified and appointed munitions
      inspectors, 7-levels, and must possess a minimum of 2-years of continuous munitions
      inspection experience and hold an 836 SEI. Note that for all inspector/senior inspector
      training and qualification requirements, civilian and contractor personnel do not hold skill
      levels or special experience identifiers (SEI), however, they must meet 836 SEI
      requirements.
      3.8.3.5. Award of SEI 836 requires Specialty Training Standard (STS) qualification,
      Munitions Inspector AFQTP completion, 8 months hands-on munitions inspection
      experience in any munitions workcenter, and supervisor‘s recommendation.
      3.8.3.6. The senior munitions inspector must have two years continuous munitions
      inspection experience within the past 48 months or have attended a formal AETC or
      MAJCOM Munitions Inspection course within the past 48 months, and hold SEI 836.
   3.8.4. NWRM Training: All personnel that are assigned NWRM duties will receive NWRM
   training IAW AFI 20-110 prior to handling any NWRM.
3.9. Static Display Munitions (SDM) and Inactive/Obsolete EOD Training Munitions
Procedures .
3.9. (35FW)Active Static Display Munitions Request Policy. The following policy is
established to ensure effective use of available munitions.
   3.9.1. These procedures apply to both SDM and Inactive/Obsolete EOD training items,
   unless specified otherwise.
   3.9.1. (35FW) To ensure munitions availability, 14 days notice is required for all use of
   static display munitions. Authorized requests include, but are not limited to: change of
   command ceremonies, air shows, retirements, dining in/out, squadron family days/photo
   opportunities, and other high visibility events as deemed appropriate by wing leadership.
   3.9.2. SDM Munitions may be placed on permanent, fix static display around munitions
   storage areas and installations to build esprit de corps and to improve overall appearance.
40                                                  AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


  This does not include inert munitions used for open houses, Ammunition CAPSTONE
  Course, change of command ceremonies, static display munitions approved through the
  USAF Museum Program or in a training environment. The Flight Chief may approve the use
  of existing inert trainers for temporary static displays IAW AFMAN 91-201 and applicable
  item T.O.
  3.9.2. (35FW) Submit a Static Display Munitions Request Letter (Attachment 6) to
  Munitions      Control,      via     fax      at    extension      226-4634      or     email
  35MXS.MXMWSA@MISAWA.AF.MIL, NLT 14 days prior to the event. All other
  requests must be approved by 35 MXG/CC. All requests will include the following: type,
  quantity, requested delivery date and time, delivery location (i.e. On/Off base, building and
  room number), date(s) and time of pick up. Upon approval of request, ensure flying schedule
  is updated if munitions will be loaded on aircraft.
  3.9.3. Inactive/Obsolete EOD training munitions may be retained only by EOD for
  continued proficiency training. HQ Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA)
  will establish accountability procedures and coordinate with the applicable Air Logistics
  Center (ALC) on assets in this category. These assets are not SDM and will not be used for
  static display purposes.
  3.9.4. The condition and appearance of SDM is a reflection of the Air Force, individual
  units, and the munitions community, and must be maintained in superior condition.
     3.9.4.1. At least annually, organizations with approved SDM will visually inspect items
     for overall appearance and platform mounting security/safety. Document this inspection
     and the person performing the inspection on a locally developed form/e-form. This form
     will be maintained with the copy of the ADR that authorizes the use of the SDM.
     3.9.4.2. This visual inspection will be documented; documentation will be stored with
     the SDM package.
     3.9.4.3. Higher Headquarters may direct units to remove SDM if not maintained in a
     fitting condition and appearance.
  3.9.5. Only unserviceable non-repairable and worldwide excess inert/empty certified
  munitions will be approved as SDM.
  3.9.6. Approved SDM items will be permanently stamped or etched with a unit specific
  SDM identifier number consisting of the acronym ―SDM‖, unit SRAN/DODAAC, and a 3-
  digit number assigned by the unit in numerical sequence. For Example: The first request
  from Osan AB, Korea for three inert MK-82s (BLU-111) would be marked SDM-FV5284-
  001 through SDM-FV5284-003.
  3.9.7. All SDMs will be secured to prevent removal of the CR or any attached sub-
  components.
  3.9.8. Request Procedures.
     3.9.8.1. When an asset requested for SDM or Inactive/Obsolete EOD training is on the
     Munitions Stock Record Account, the MASO must submit an ADR to the appropriate
     ALC requesting authorization. Assets obtained by an organization without coordination
     through the local Munitions Flight will be the responsibility of that organization.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                            41


     3.9.8.2. The following statements will be made (as appropriate) in the ‗Reason for
     Reporting‘ block:
         3.9.8.2.1. For SDM: ―Request the munitions items listed on this document be
         retained for static display. I certify the munitions listed are unserviceable, non-
         repairable for operational use, and free of explosives and explosive residue. The
         munitions will be marked SDM-FVXXXX-000 through SDM-FVXXXX-000 and
         placed on permanent, fixed static display within 90 calendar days of receipt of
         approval. This action has been coordinated through Munitions Supervision.‖
         3.9.8.2.2. For Inactive/Obsolete EOD training: ―Request the munitions items listed
         on this document be inventory adjusted off record and provided to EOD. Items have
         been declared inactive/obsolete by USAF for operational use and will not be
         maintained in the active inventory. I certify the munitions listed are free of
         explosives and explosive residue.‖
     3.9.8.3. All unserviceable defects will be listed on the ADR.
     3.9.8.4. The ADR will specifically identify the requesting organization. If approved, this
     organization will be the owning organization and will be responsible for the inspection,
     appearance and maintenance of the item. The owning user will forward documentation
     of annual inspections to the MASO. The MASO will file latest inspection documentation
     with the original SDM paperwork.
     3.9.8.5. The Product Team Item Manager (IM) and Equipment Specialist (ES) will
     review requests, make worldwide excess stock (SDM/EOD items) and/or non-repairable
     determinations (SDM only), and recommend approval/disapproval to the PM. The PM
     will approve/disapprove the request.
     3.9.8.6. If approved, munitions will be inventory adjusted from accountable records by
     the MASO and tracked by ADR number (SDM will be tracked by ADR and SDM
     number). For EOD items, the EOD unit will manage and track these assets IAW
     procedures established by HQ AFCESA.
         3.9.8.6.1. The ADR will be the sole proof of authorization to adjust accountable
         records. No other supporting documentation is required.
         3.9.8.6.2. The SDM final display location (i.e., entry to bldg XXX, MSA Main gate,
         static display aircraft at west gate, etc.) will be annotated on all copies of the
         approved ADR. SDMs owned by Munitions Flight shall be tracked in CAS under
         non-accountable.
         3.9.8.6.3. SDM not placed on permanent display within the specified 90 calendar day
         timeframe will again be reported on AF IMT 191, ADR for final disposition.
  3.9.9. Final Disposition.
     3.9.9.1. SDM removed from display will be returned to accountable records using an
     Organizational Turn-in (ORG TIN) according to paragraph 7.16.1.1 and reported on an
     ADR for final disposition. SDM numbers will be reported for each item removed from
     static display.
 42                                                AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


      3.9.9.2. Inactive/Obsolete EOD training items may be retained as serviceable as long as
      they serve their intended purpose and do not present a safety hazard or reduce training
      capability.
      3.9.9.3. Inactive/Obsolete EOD training items no longer used for training will be
      disposed of IAW DOD 4160.21-M-1, Demilitarization Manual (demil codes) by the
      owning EOD organization.
   3.9.10. Historical/Archival Records.
      3.9.10.1. For SDM: The Munitions organization, owning organization, and 784 CBSG or
      782 CBSG will maintain copies of original ADRs for the entire period munitions are on
      static display.
      3.9.10.2. For Inactive/Obsolete EOD items: AFCESA and the owning EOD organization
      will establish procedures to properly utilize, account, document, and dispose of these
      assets.
3.10. Missile and PGM Management.
   3.10.1. General Missile Management: Unserviceable components will be shipped to depot
   facilities, using priority 02 and CC-F. The GACP may approve less than QUP after
   coordination with appropriate PM. WSEP Program missile components will be shipped
   priority 05.
   3.10.2. Air Intercept Missile (AIM) -9M Procedures.
      3.10.2.1. Units do not requisition AIM-9M AUR missiles including AIM-9M CATMs.
      The GACP (782 CBSG) distributes AIM-9M AUR missiles based on approved
      allocations. If needed to support CATM allocations, units may requisition the Missile
      Body Section (MBS) and Guidance Control Unit (GCU) to build-up the CATM. In this
      case, unit places the following remarks in the requisition 'Comments' field: FYXX Alloc
      CATM New Build.
      3.10.2.2. If on-hand quantity of serviceable GCUs is less than the allocated AUR and
      CATM quantity, requisition replacement GCUs based on the number of unserviceable
      GCUs shipped to depot or manufacturer using priority 02. Place the TCN and quantity of
      shipped GCUs in CC-F in the 'Comments' field (i.e., 4 EA FV0003 7329 7503, F). GCUs
      will be shipped in QUP. Note: AIM-9M GCS requisitions are limited by the AIM-9M
      AUR, CATM, Stubby, and GCS asset posture. Only the AUR and CATM are allocated.
      3.10.2.3. Units will maintain Captive Air Training Missile (CATM)-9s by the CATM-9
      NSN.
   3.10.3. MUNS Supt/Flight Chief/Commander ensures plans are in-place to reconstitute
   ‗stubby missiles‘ from GCUs installed on CATMs.
   3.10.4. Component Replacement Procedures. Manage replacement components as follows:
      3.10.4.1. If a spare replacement component is in stock, remove and replace the
      component, process a CC/identity change for the unserviceable component and update
      records in TMRS.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                              43


       3.10.4.2. If no replacement component is in stock the unit may elect to remove a
       component from a donor AUR.
          3.10.4.2.1. Units are not required to segregate donor missiles within individual
          containers. Do not change the donor AUR to a stubby NSN. Change the donor
          missile to CC-G and attach the appropriate 15XX series tag to the missile and
          container. For example: If four CC-A missiles are in a container and a component is
          removed from one of the missiles, place the affected missile in CC-G, apply the
          appropriate 15XX series tag, and return to the same container.
          3.10.4.2.2. Follow documentation procedures for Stockpile Consumption Issues and
          TIN.
          3.10.4.2.3. Process an ORG TIN for the unserviceable component and requisition a
          replacement component IAW paragraph 7.7.
          3.10.4.2.4. Change the CC of the AUR and update records in TMRS.
       3.10.4.3. When no replacement assets are available, process a DIFM issue to
       Organization/Shop (ORG/SHP) 002SM which will generate a due-out and requisition
       replacement.
          3.10.4.3.1. TIN the unserviceable component from the AUR using DIFM TIN
          procedures against the DIFM due-out document IAW paragraph 7.16.1.4.
          3.10.4.3.2. Change the AUR to CC-G and update TMRS records.
          3.10.4.3.3. Upon receipt of replacement component perform DIFM consumption
          issue against the due-out DIFM document to ORG/SHP 002SM, change CC and
          update records in TMRS.
   3.10.5. AIM/CATM-9 GCU Management.
       3.10.5.1. Perform a selective identity change on tactical AURs when the WGU-4 GCU,
       BSU-32 Fins and TMU-72 argon bottles are removed to support CATM authorizations.
       Identify the remaining components under the stubby National Stock Number (NSN):
       1427-01-319-9495AB.
       3.10.5.2. The total number of ‗stubbies‘ cannot exceed the unit‘s CATM allocation.
   3.10.6. Units are not authorized to fly tactical missiles unless authorized by AFI 11-214, Air
   Operations Rules and Procedures.
3.11. WRM Munitions Program Element Code PEC 28030.
   3.11.1. Units with PEC 28030 requirements develop and submit budget forecasts per AFI
   25-101 for inclusion in the base financial plan.
   3.11.2. After PEC 28030 funds are allocated, Commanders of munitions activities,
   munitions supervision and the MASO closely monitor fund expenditure to ensure fulfillment
   of WRM munitions maintenance requirements.
3.12. Disposition of Munitions.
   3.12.1. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). To meet current and future
   mission requirements, the munitions management program must incorporate protection of the
44                                                  AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


  environment as a national priority. Federal and State laws and regulations establish
  requirements for management and disposal of Waste Military Munitions (WMM).
  Applicable federal law includes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Military
  Munitions Rule (MMR) (40 C.F.R. Subpart M). WMM are military munitions designated by
  the appropriate USAF Designated Disposition Authority (DDA) as no longer acceptable for
  any useful purpose, or determined by EOD as requiring a Level 1 or 2 emergency responses.
  Disposal of these items is then directed by the Installation Commander. All WMM
  management activities shall consult with the base environmental function to determine the
  laws applicable at that base and comply with those laws. OCONUS locations must follow
  the MMR environmental requirements in this AFI unless conflicts exist with the following:
  Host-nation final governing standards, DOD Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance
  Document, and Status of Forces Agreements.               The link to the MMR is:
  https://www.denix.osd.mil/denix/Public/Policy/Range/rule.html
     3.12.1.1. The MMR amended Federal RCRA regulations requiring WMM to be managed
     as a hazardous waste. The MMR is a federal standard, not a national standard and the
     State can either adopt the MMR or choose to enact a state MMR regulation that is more
     stringent than the Federal regulation. Each base (led by its environmental function) must
     determine the extent of state (or territory) adoption and compare it to EPA‘s MMR and
     DOD implementation policy of the MMR.
     3.12.1.2. The EPA‘s MMR establishes Federal requirements for obtaining a conditional
     exemption from regulating WMM as a RCRA hazardous waste. One of the requirements
     for obtaining the federal conditional exemption is managing WMM IAW Department of
     Defense Explosive Safety Board (DDESB) rules. If a State has adopted its own MMR,
     the State MMR will determine if a conditional exemption is available and the
     requirements for obtaining it. When a state has adopted its own rules for obtaining a
     conditional exemption, DDESB rules must also be followed Non-compliance could
     result in fines or even criminal penalties for known violations. To the fullest extent
     possible, the base should coordinate with all DOD components within the state or
     territory to assure the MMR is being managed in a consistent manner.
     3.12.1.3. Bases can be EPA or state authorized for treatment of WMM as RCRA
     hazardous waste in specified Open Burn/Open Detonation (OB/OD) units. Where a
     treatment permit has been issued or interim status pre-permitting authorization obtained
     by the base, WMM shall be managed IAW the EPA/state permit or interim status rules.
  3.12.1. 4 Non-compliance with RCRA Federal or State laws, whichever is most stringent,
  can result in fines or penalties to include criminal penalties for known violations. WMM
  activities shall be conducted in compliance with all applicable environmental requirements.
  3.12.2. Conventional munitions, missiles and their components are managed IAW this AFI
  and retained in the Air Force inventory as long as there is a requirement and the assets are
  serviceable, or economically reparable or recoverable. Units shall not identify unused
  military munitions as hazardous waste until authorization from a USAF DDA, EOD or
  installation commander has been secured indicating that the munitions cannot be put into
  serviceable condition and cannot be recycled or used for other purposes. Once a
  determination is made by an authorized military official, units shall comply with all
  applicable environmental requirements.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                               45


  3.12.3. Where proposed or effective state law or a proposed or existing RCRA permit
  condition is determined to exceed or conflict with the policy contained in this AFI or
  AFMAN 91-201, the installation environmental and legal offices shall first attempt to resolve
  the administrative conflict through consultation and/or permit modifications with the state
  authority. The installation shall comply with all applicable environmental laws and permit
  conditions pending resolution of the conflict.
     3.12.3.1. Disputes with state/local regulators must be referred at once to installation
     environmental and legal offices for possible resolution.
     3.12.3.2. In resolving conflicts, life protection will be the primary concern of the
     decision-maker and AFMAN 91-201 standards will remain in effect pending resolution.
  3.12.4. Disposition of Recovered Items: Response Level 1, Level 2, Emergency, and
  Routine.
     3.12.4.1. The responsibility to consider safety begins at the lowest level, and the
     authority to deal with a problem as an immediate response begins with the munitions
     handler.
     3.12.4.2. A USAF DDA is the only approval authority for disposition of military
     munitions items as WMM. EOD response specialists conduct level 1 and 2 emergency
     responses. Hazardous munitions items designated by EOD as Level 1 or Level 2 do not
     require DDA approval prior to disposal. EOD response specialist will contact the base
     Environmental Function to ensure all state requirements are met prior to disposal.
         3.12.4.2.1. The DDA for conventional munitions other than Air Superiority Missiles
         (ASM) is the 784 CBSG.
         3.12.4.2.2. The DDA for ASM is the 782 CBSG.
     3.12.4.3. When the EOD response specialist determines that munitions requires an
     ‗IMMEDIATE RESPONSE (Level 1)‘ (e.g. not safe to transport or store), or that a
     munitions item requires an ‗IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL ENDANGERMENT
     RESPONSE (Level 2)‘ (e.g. the item can be transported and temporarily stored awaiting
     state notification or permits), request for disposition from a DDA is not necessary
         3.12.4.3.1. If as a result of a level 2 emergency, a munitions item is turned over to the
         military installation for temporary storage, the EOD specialist will annotate
         ―IMMINENT AND SUBSTANTIAL ENDANGERMENT RESPONSE (Level 2)‖
         on the FOB Turn-in document.
         3.12.4.3.2. The munitions activity or EOD will immediately request that the
         installation environmental function obtain the necessary permits or oral authorization
         from Federal, State and/or Local authorities. Oral authorizations must be documented
         and the installation must follow-up with the agency to assure a complete record is
         maintained.
         3.12.4.3.3. If the state environmental regulatory agency (or host nation equivalent)
         grants an emergency disposal permit or authorization, items will be disposed of IAW
         emergency disposal procedures. If an emergency disposal permit or authorization is
         not granted, the installation environmental and legal offices will immediately elevate
         the issue to the MAJCOM Munitions Staff and Environmental Function Offices and
46                                                 AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


        the Air Force Regional Environmental Function for resolution. Annually the
        munitions activity will request EOD to re-evaluate munitions from Level 2
        emergencies that are in prolonged storage; this is to ensure they have not become an
        immediate hazard (e.g., a Level 1 emergency response).
     3.12.4.4. When the EOD response specialist declares that recovered munitions do not or
     no longer require emergency action (ROUTINE-Not Level 1 or 2), and the munitions are
     returned to the military installation for storage, then the EOD response specialist will
     annotate ―ROUTINE‖ on the FOB turn-in document.
        3.12.4.4.1. Munitions personnel will request for disposition from a DDA.
        3.12.4.4.2. Munitions found off base that are declared ROUTINE- NOT Level 1 or
        Level 2, have unknown storage history, or are rendered/declared safe by EOD, will be
        evaluated from a storage and transportation aspect by the appropriate DDA for
        disposition determination.
     3.12.4.5. The EOD response specialist determines the need for disposal or destruction of
     munitions or explosives that constitutes an immediate danger to human life or property.
     Coordination and approval of emergency disposal or destruction actions is established
     locally per safety and EOD procedures.
        3.12.4.5.1. The base MASO must inform the appropriate program management team
        when stock-listed munitions or explosives are found to be immediately dangerous and
        the condition is not a result of misuse or mishandling using the GACP CRM.
        3.12.4.5.1. (35FW) Ammunition and explosives dangerous to life and/or property
        must also be immediately reported to Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), Fire
        Department, Security Forces and Wing Safety, as required. Contact Munitions
        Control for any accident or incident involving AF munitions or aircraft egress
        systems. Custodian will provide turn-in document to Munitions Accountability
        Element for any asset turned over to EOD for disposal.
            3.12.4.5.1.1. Appropriate production lot suspension or restriction actions must be
            assessed or initiated by the product team (PT/IPT) through the appropriate ES or
            PM after disposal actions/decisions.
            3.12.4.5.1.2. The PT/IPT will take prompt action to advise users that the lot has
            been restricted or suspended in CMRS.
        3.12.4.5.2. If munitions personnel have any questions or doubts about the safety of
        munitions assets, contact your supporting EOD unit.
        3.12.4.5.3. Once EOD personnel have determined that the response can be delayed
        without compromising safety or increasing the risk to human health, follow the
        Imminent and Substantial Endangerment Response (Level 2) instructions in the DOD
        Munitions Rule implementation procedures.
        3.12.4.5.4. The installation should ensure advanced procedures are established with
        the appropriate environmental regulatory agencies that enable EOD to quickly and
        effectively respond to EOD declared Level 1 and 2 responses without delay or further
        risk to human life or property.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                            47


     3.12.4.6. Each installation must assure that a partnership is established between the
     Environmental function, Judge Advocate (JA), EOD, and the munitions organization to
     plan the implementation of EPA‘s Munitions Rule related policy, installation strategy,
     and to resolve any munitions-related environmental concerns at the lowest level. The
     installation environmental function is responsible to chair the meetings, establish the
     agenda and provide meeting minutes to all members.
  3.12.5. Disposition of Excess Munitions.
     3.12.5.1. Do not use AF IMT 191, ADR or the automated ADR system for reporting
     excess serviceable munitions.
     3.12.5.2. Serviceable excess will be determined by the GACP and prioritized for
     movement in the annual GAP MMP IAW paragraph 8.4.10.5.11.
  3.12.6. Disposition of DOD Stock-listed Munitions.
     3.12.6.1. When DOD stock-listed conventional munitions, missiles, and related
     explosive components become unserviceable at base level, the intent of the DOD is to
     ship assets to the appropriate location for further evaluation/screening for recycling and
     other utility before final disposition.
     3.12.6.2. Processing ADR.
         3.12.6.2.1. The munitions inspector will initiate and the MASO must approve,
         forward or delete the ADR in CAS.
         3.12.6.2.2. After receiving an ADR, the DDA will provide disposition instructions to
         the initiator within calendar 60 days. If disposition instructions are not received
         within 60 calendar days the MASO or designated representative shall follow-up using
         the GACP CRM until disposition instructions are received.
         3.12.6.2.3. Units may print to file the ADR document to capture disposition
         instructions.
         3.12.6.2.4. The ADR transaction in CAS will be finalized by the MASO after
         receiving instruction from the DDA.
     3.12.6.3. Policy for implementation of the EPA MMR states that only a DDA may
     designate munitions as waste.
         3.12.6.3.1. For the Air Force, the PT/IPT evaluates and recommends actions to the
         DDA. The DDAs are designated in writing by the Product Group Manager (PGM)
         and have final disposition authority.
         3.12.6.3.2. The DDA response to an ADR will either direct shipment to another
         location for further evaluation/screening for Resource Recovery and Recycling (R3)
         or designate the munitions as waste and direct shipment to an EPA permitted or
         interim status Open Burn/Open Detonation (OB/OD) unit.
         3.12.6.3.3. If the ship to location is an Army Depot, the DDA will furnish the
         appropriate address. The MASO must assure this address is included in the
         supplementary address (blocks 45-50) of the shipping document.
48                                                  AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


     3.12.6.4. If the DDA directs shipment to another installation, the originating base MASO
     must assure compliance.
         3.12.6.4.1. If the DDA has no alternative disposition for the munitions, the base will
         receive notification to dispose.
            3.12.6.4.1.1. Base munitions personnel will take action to segregate this waste
            munitions from serviceable/unserviceable assets.
            3.12.6.4.1.2. The waste munitions must be clearly marked. Such identification
            may be by individual unit, pallet load, igloo, etc.
            3.12.6.4.1.3. Separate storage facilities are not required for munitions designated
            as waste provided that all requirements of EPA‘s MMR or applicable state law are
            met, and DDESB standards are followed.
            3.12.6.4.1.4. ADRs will be initiated on all unserviceable items upon inspector
            classification. Once disposition instructions have been provided, units may
            accumulate assets for quarterly consolidated shipments unless otherwise directed
            on the ADR.
         3.12.6.4.2. The EPA‘s MMR provides that munitions which are stored in compliance
         with all requirements of the rule, including the requirement to meet DDESB
         standards, are not considered ‗waste‘ by EPA until the munitions leave the magazine
         door enroute to a non-military owned or operated treatment, storage, or disposal
         facility.
         3.12.6.4.3. The EPA (RCRA) MMR provides that munitions that are deteriorated or
         damaged to the point that the munitions cannot be put into serviceable condition, and
         cannot reasonably be recycled or used for other purposes, are WMM while in storage.
         When deteriorated or damaged munitions are identified, base munitions personnel
         should notify the Environmental Function to determine if the state or territory has
         adopted the MMR Conditional Exemption for storage and to ensure the required
         regulatory notifications are made. If the Conditional Exemption is not available, the
         supporting EOD unit should be contacted to address the WMM as an emergency
         response (Level 1 or Level 2).
     3.12.6.5. Unserviceable and non-repairable inert munitions items and accessories with
     DEMIL code other than ‗F‘ and valued at $500 or less per item, which cannot be used for
     local training, may be approved for disposal by the base MASO using the CAS ADR
     process. Disposal will be IAW DOD 4160.21-M, Defense Materiel Disposition Manual
     and DOD 4160.21-M-1, Defense Demilitarization Manual.
     3.12.6.6. Unserviceable, inert munitions items and accessories with DEMIL code ‗F‘,
     valued at $500 or over may have utility as spare parts and related historical data could be
     used for trend analysis. Submit ADR in CAS.
  3.12.7. Disposition of DOD Non-Stock-listed Munitions.
     3.12.7.1. MASOs may authorize local disposition of research, development, test and
     evaluation assets or excess items that have been used in research and development
     projects/tests if project managers cannot return them to an original configuration (L10
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                              49


     stock-listed items). Project managers are responsible for providing disposition
     instructions and for all costs associated with disposal.
     3.12.7.2. Assets subjected to temperature treatment, vibration, or impact testing
     (regardless of stock-listed status) will not be returned for issue or redistribution. Such
     items are inherently suspected and pose safety risks for general use.
     3.12.7.3. After a non-stock-listed munitions item has been used/considered for use in a
     test or evaluation program, the asset will be evaluated to determine its safety and proper
     identification. Project managers are responsible for costs associated with obtaining
     proper safety/identification evaluation if this cannot be determined by local agencies.
         3.12.7.3.1. If assets cannot be properly identified, meet hazard classification (HC)
         requirements, Department of Transportation (DOT) requirements, or otherwise
         accepted for another program they should, on a-case-by-case, be considered for local
         treatment/demilitarization.
         3.12.7.3.2. If the safety of an asset (from a storage and handling aspect) cannot be
         determined with certainty, treat the asset as a Level 2 response and coordinate its
         treatment/disposal with the base environmental function, EOD, and the appropriate
         Air Force DDA. The installation commander has the final disposition authority.
  3.12.8. Disposition of Commercial off the Shelf (COTS), Non-Stock-listed, Military
  Munitions.
     3.12.8.1. Disposition requests for munitions purchased through the COTS system (i.e.,
     certified by Non-nuclear Munitions safety Board (NNMSB) and approved by 784 CBSG
     for munitions system management) will be requested through the ADR process. If local
     stock numbers are assigned, list a DOD stock-listed item the COTS munitions is closely
     related to (i.e., shotgun shells, 9mm hollow-point) in the remarks section.
     3.12.8.2. Commanders that elect to purchase COTS munitions not approved for
     munitions system management, but have received NNMSB approval, must accept
     ‗cradle-to-grave‘ responsibility for the munitions at the local level. This would include
     all use outside the MSA and final disposition of malfunctions (Duds), residue and excess.
  3.12.9. Disposition of Non-Stock-listed, Non-Military Munitions.
     3.12.9.1. When munitions found on base or turned in from amnesty boxes are delivered
     to the Munitions Storage Area, munitions personnel will ensure that EOD or SFS have
     determined whether item(s) are derived from any military source. If this determination
     can be made with certainty, follow disposition instructions contained in paragraph 3.12.4.
     3.12.9.2. If it cannot be determined if the item(s) are from a military source, or safe from
     a storage and handling aspect, treat the item(s) as a Level 2 response and coordinate its
     disposal with the base environmental function and EOD.
         3.12.9.2.1. The installation Commander has the final disposition authority.
         3.12.9.2.2. If the decision is made to dispose, existing Air Force OB/OD Units
         should be considered. Prior to selecting an existing OB/OD Unit, the following
         conditions must exist:
            3.12.9.2.2.1. When explosive assets are declared Level-2, the munitions activity
 50                                                    AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


              shall initiate actions through the local installation environmental function IAW
              paragraph. 3.12.4.3.2.
              3.12.9.2.2.2. The OB/OD unit option is more cost effective than other local
              disposal options (i.e., civilian contract).
              3.12.9.2.2.3. The receiving installation OB/OD Unit must be EPA permitted to
              treat the type and quantity of munitions requiring disposal and to receive those
              waste munitions from off-site sources for disposal.
   3.12.10. Disposition procedures for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) unserviceable munitions
   generated at USAF installations:
      3.12.10.1. The host installation FMS manager must request the installation munitions
      unit initiate disposition action for any FMS munitions in writing.
      3.12.10.2. The munitions unit will initiate an Ammunition Disposition Request (ADR) as
      requested by the host installation FMS manager.
      3.12.10.3. Assets with an NSN in CAS will be processed as an ORG TIN. Assets with
      no NSN in CAS will be processed as Non-CAS ADR.
      3.12.10.4. The ADR will include:
          3.12.10.4.1. The reason for reporting.
          3.12.10.4.2. The name of owning FMS country.
          3.12.10.4.3. Request that disposition costs be provided.
          3.12.10.4.4. Request that ship-to disposal location be provide along with where to
          MIPR/transfer funds for disposition.
      3.12.10.5. The USAF DDA will coordinate with the DOD DDA and Army Disposal
      Installations for the requested information.
      3.12.10.6. The USAF DDA will return the ADR to the requesting AF installation
      munitions unit providing instructions and requested information.
      3.12.10.7. All costs for shipment and disposition are the responsibility of the host
      installation FMS manager at the generating installation. The host installation FMS
      manager will arrange and transfer required funds IAW instructions provided on the ADR.
      Copies of the ADR and MIPR will accompany the shipment.
      3.12.10.8. The installation munitions unit will prepare and book shipment IAW DDA
      disposition instructions only after the MASO receives a copy of the funds transfer
      document provided by the installation FMS manager.
      3.12.10.9. The U.S. Army will provide closing disposal actions on the disposition
      request.
3.13. Management of Material Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard (MPPEH).
   3.13.1. MPPEH is material owned or controlled by the DOD (to include DOD contractors as
   provided in contracts) that, prior to determination of its explosives safety status, potentially
   contains explosives or munitions and typically includes munitions containers and packaging
   material; munitions debris remaining after munitions use, demilitarization, or disposal; and
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                           51


  range-related debris. MPPEH also includes material that potentially contains a high enough
  concentration of explosives that the material presents an explosive hazard (e.g., equipment,
  drainage systems, holding tanks, piping, or ventilation ducts that were associated with
  munitions production, demilitarization, or disposal operations).
  3.13.2. Excluded from MPPEH are:
     3.13.2.1. Munitions within the DOD-established munitions management system.
     Munitions maintained, stored, transported, and utilized within the operational stockpile
     are not considered MPPEH. This includes empty containers temporarily retained for
     repacking assets in maintenance or in-use for current operations.
     3.13.2.2. Munitions containers or packaging materiel that can be positively identified as
     explosive free through normal visual means are not considered MPPEH. These
     containers will still be inspected, certified, marked, sealed, segregated and disposed of
     IAW T.O. 11A-1-60.
     3.13.2.3. Military munitions or material transferred within or released from DOD control
     that are used for their intended purposes. Transfer or release occurs when a receiver has
     acknowledged receipt of Material Documented as Safe (MDAS) (see paragraph 3.13.3.2.)
     or Material Documented as an Explosive Hazard (MDEH) (see paragraph 3.13.3.3.) by
     signed documentation (e.g., DD Form 1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt Document, or an
     equivalent document) and has taken physical custody of the MDAS or MDEH from the
     Department of Defense.
     3.13.2.4. Material managed and handled by personnel outside of the DOD, except for
     defense contractors as provided in contracts.
  3.13.3. All generated MPPEH requires a documented inspection by qualified personnel (see
  paragraph 3.13.9.2.) to determine and classify MMPEH as either MDAS or MDEH.
     3.13.3.1. Once MPPEH is determined to be either MDAS or MDEH, this material is no
     longer considered to be MPPEH.
     3.13.3.2. MDAS is previously generated MPPEH that has been inspected and
     documented (certified) as not presenting an explosive hazard. Once documented as
     MDAS, ensure this material is not misidentified as either MPPEH or MDEH.
     3.13.3.3. MDEH is previously generated MPPEH that cannot be documented as MDAS,
     and includes:
         3.13.3.3.1. MPPEH that has been inspected and documented as to the maximum
         explosive hazards the material is known or suspected to present. Once identified as
         MDEH, this material is no longer considered to be MPPEH. Ensure that MDEH is not
         misidentified as either MPPEH or MDAS. For example: Potentially MDEH material
         is all explosive items and their containers that have been used, expended, or residue
         generated from disposal operations.
         3.13.3.3.2. MDEH classification only addresses the explosives safety status of
         material. For example: MPPEH that cannot be positively determined to be MDAS,
         will be classified as MDEH and is therefore assumed to contain material with
         explosive hazards.
52                                                   AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


  3.13.4. MPPEH inspection and documentation as MDAS or MDEH is completed IAW
  paragraph 3.13.9.2.
  3.13.5. Establish and maintain a chain of custody for all MPPEH, MDAS, and MDEH
  through its life-cycle until transfer, expenditure, or disposal. Utilize existing CAS and
  munitions management procedures and processes in chapter 7 to maintain a chain of custody
  for these assets. Existing physical, transactional, and informational processes all contribute
  to maintaining a chain of custody.
  3.13.6. Control and manage MPPEH, MDAS, and MDEH to prevent its unauthorized use,
  transfer, or release; comply with supply chain materiel management policies and explosive
  safety standards IAW existing CAS and munitions management procedures and processes in
  chapter 7.
     3.13.6.1. Ensure that holding areas for MPPEH are located in secure areas and included
     in local facility threat assessments, when conducted by Resource Protection personnel.
     3.13.6.2. Under no circumstances will USAF munitions units or munitions personnel
     release MPPEH to non-DOD entities for possession, management, and processing.
         3.13.6.2.1. Contracts or other legal agreements to transfer or release MPPEH to non-
         DOD entities are the responsibility of the generating activity. USAF munitions
         activities and personnel do not establish or fund contracts for release of MPPEH to
         non-DOD entities.
         3.13.6.2.2. Explosive hazards must be identified, known, and documented prior to
         the transfer of any MPPEH, MDEH, or MDAS within the Department of Defense;
         transfer of MDEH to a qualified receiver; or release of MDAS to the public.
         3.13.6.2.3. USAF units, organizations, and activities that generate range-related
         debris are responsible for managing security, chain of custody, inspection, and
         documentation from collection through release from DOD control as MDAS. USAF
         munitions personnel secure, manage, inspect, and document MPPEH, MDEH, or
         MDAS only when it is returned to the base or installation munitions storage area
         (MSA) for processing.
         3.13.6.2.4. IAW DODI 4140.62, MPPEH will be managed and processed (e.g.,
         sorted, vented, inspected, segregated, and secured) on the operational range or at the
         point of use to minimize handling and transport prior to processing and to facilitate
         disposition.
             3.13.6.2.4.1. The movement of MPPEH from either the operational range or the
             point of use could require its management as waste military munitions under
             applicable Federal or State requirements in certain circumstances.
             3.13.6.2.4.2. Commands and organizations will minimize transfer of explosive
             residue or munitions constituents from MPPEH into the environment during the
             management and disposition process.
             3.13.6.2.4.3. USAF munitions personnel only transfer or release MPPEH and
             MDEH to those DOD components and activities and personnel that meet the
             requirements for certification, licensing and permits, transportation, training, and
             experience outlined in DOD 4140.62.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                             53


  3.13.7. Ensure that only MDAS is released to the public.
  3.13.8. Ensure that MPPEH awaiting documentation of its explosives safety status, MDEH,
  and MDAS are never commingled.
  3.13.9. Ensure that containers and holding areas for material being processed within the
  MSA are secured and clearly marked as to:
     3.13.9.1. The hazards, if any, that may be present.
     3.13.9.2. The inspection and reinspection (or processing and inspection) and
     documentation of the explosives safety status of the material present. Documentation of
     MDAS requires two independent signatures by trained and certified personnel.
         3.13.9.2.1. The first signatory must be technically qualified and may be either a DOD
         employee or a DOD contractor. This signatory must have performed or witnessed the
         initial 100-percent inspection or DDESB-approved processing of the material.
         3.13.9.2.2. The second signatory must be a technically qualified U.S. citizen who
         may be either a DOD employee or a DOD contractor. This signatory must have
         performed or witnessed the independent 100-percent reinspection or conducted an
         independent quality assurance inspection of processed material using an approved
         sampling method.
         3.13.9.2.3. Each signatory must ensure the chain of custody was maintained before
         signing the explosives safety documentation.
  3.13.10. Ensure that locations used for MPPEH or MDEH processing operations (e.g.,
  consolidation, inspection, sorting, storage, transfer, release) have appropriate explosives
  safety siting.
  3.13.11. Munitions and MPPEH Demilitarization/Disposal Documentation Procedures.
     3.13.11.1. All ADR munitions assets authorized for demilitarization or disposal must be
     processed using program Create ADR Shipment (AMI28A). This program creates an A5J
     DD Form 1348-1A document for those ADRs that are being processed for DRMO action
     and a SHP DD Form 1348-1A for disposal.
         3.13.11.1.1. When the demilitarization or disposal activity is not on the same base as
         the munitions account processing the A5J input, the SRAN/DODAAC of the base
         where the demilitarization or disposal activity is located must be entered as the ―Ship
         to‖ address.
             3.13.11.1.1.1. Inert, empty or non-explosive munitions and components are
             demilitarized according to their DEMIL Code by qualified munitions personnel.
             When munitions flight personnel conduct the demilitarization, the base DRMO
             SRAN/DODAAC will be the ―Ship to‖ address.
             3.13.11.1.1.2. Transfers (Shipments) to central disposal activities will be
             processed using the ‗Disposal‘ selection within Create ADR Shipment (AMI28A)
             and shipped according to paragraph 7.13.
         3.13.11.1.2. Explosives or classified assets must be fully demilitarized as directed by
         DOD Manual 4160.21-M. Non-explosives and non-classified assets must be
54                                                 AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


        demilitarized as directed by the demilitarization code assigned to them. Refer to the
        asset IDR or Federal Catalog (FEDLOG) for demilitarization code, Controlled
        Inventory Item Code (CIIC), and definition.
     3.13.11.2. Inspect and certify Ammunition, Explosives, Dangerous Articles (AEDA),
     AEDA residue, MMPEH, range residue and explosives-contaminated property, IAW
     DOD 4160.21-M, Defense Materiel Disposition Manual, Chapter 4, DODI 4140.62, and
     T.O. 11A-1-60.
        3.13.11.2.1. If a determination cannot be made if the residue is non-hazardous,
        consult with the DDA and the local Environmental Function (See paragraph
        3.13.11.2.4.). Residue may have to be tested for Toxic Characteristic Leaching
        Process performed by an EPA certified laboratory. Report findings from the test to
        784 CBSG for consolidation for future reference.
        3.13.11.2.2. Comply with procedures of DOD 4160.21-M and DODI 4140.62.
           3.13.11.2.2.1. Visual inspections may be used when safety can be assured. When
           visual inspection cannot provide assurance that MPPEH does not present an
           explosive hazard, other DDESB-approved means (e.g., thermal treatment) may
           have to be used to ensure that a release or transfer does not present an explosive
           hazard to a receiver.
           3.13.11.2.2.2. Only one signature is required to document MDEH when a visual
           inspection can positively assure MPPEH is documented as to the hazard it is
           known or suspected to present.
           3.13.11.2.2.3. Documentation of the determination of the material‘s explosives
           safety status must state either:
               3.13.11.2.2.3.1. MDAS: The material does not present an explosive hazard
               and is consequently safe from an explosives safety perspective for transfer
               within or release from DOD control.
               3.13.11.2.2.3.2. MDEH: The material is hazardous with the known or
               suspected explosive hazards (MDEH) stated and is only transferable or
               releasable to a qualified receiver.
           3.13.11.2.2.4. Demilitarization procedures established by Defense Logistics
           Agency (DLA), the USAF, or the SCMA shall address when visual inspection is
           appropriate and the procedures that may be used to inspect or process MPPEH.
           3.13.11.2.2.5. Inspect and document MDAS or MDEH based on one of the
           following two conditions:
               3.13.11.2.2.5.1. After a 100-percent inspection and an independent 100-
               percent reinspection.
               3.13.11.2.2.5.2. After processing by a DDESB-approved means with an
               appropriate post-processing inspection.
        3.13.11.2.3. If additional instructions are required, contact the GACP through the
        CRM IAW paragraph 1.5.1.4.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                           55


         3.13.11.2.4. The USAF DDA will coordinate with PM for military munitions
         acquisition programs and the Director, DLA, to establish demilitarization
         requirements for MPPEH, MDEH, and MDAS. DODI 4140.62 requires PMs for
         military munitions acquisition programs to ensure that the programs planning, design,
         and implementation include MPPEH requirements to:
             3.13.11.2.4.1. Document the expected level of explosive residue and other
             munitions‘ constituents that remain on used or demilitarized military munitions
             (e.g., cartridge casings).
             3.13.11.2.4.2. For MPPEH generated from munitions use, to define specific
             demilitarization and disposal procedures that comply with applicable DOD
             explosives safety standards, trade security controls, and demilitarization
             requirements.
      3.13.11.3. Temporary Property Accountability by:
         3.13.11.3.1. DRMO: Munitions authorized for demilitarization or disposal according
         to the ADR will be scheduled for demilitarization or disposal on a certain date.
             3.13.11.3.1.1. Coordination between munitions inspection, accountability and the
             demilitarization activity will ensure that disposal documents are produced no
             earlier than 5 duty days before the scheduled demilitarization or disposal date.
             3.13.11.3.1.2. The A5J will be accomplished and original document provided to
             DRMO with a copy to the Munitions Operations element.
             3.13.11.3.1.3. If complete disposal occurs (as with explosives) DRMO will not
             normally receive scrap.
             3.13.11.3.1.4. Documents will then be routed to the Munitions Inspection
             Element for shipment inspection and temporary property accountability before the
             assets are transferred to the demilitarization activity or the DRMO.
         3.13.11.3.2. EOD: Documents for the emergency disposal of munitions will be
         accomplished IAW paragraph 7.13.2.1.7.
      3.13.11.4. Demilitarization/Disposal Certification Procedures:
         3.13.11.4.1. DRMO: If residual saleable materiel remains, the demilitarization
         official must certify that "DEMILITARIZATION HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED.
         THERE IS RESIDUAL MATERIEL WHICH HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED TO
         SCRAP". The stock number must be circled and the word SCRAP entered. The
         scrap materiel and the documents must be returned to DRMO for processing.
         3.13.11.4.2. EOD: For complete destruction of items, emergency disposal action, the
         disposal and witnessing officials must certify "DISPOSAL HAS BEEN
         ACCOMPLISHED. THERE IS NO RESIDUAL MATERIEL WHICH HAS BEEN
         DOWNGRADED TO WASTE".               This statement will be annotated on the
         consumption issue document and signed by the disposal and witnessing officials.
3.14. Captured Enemy Ammunition (CEA).
56                                                   AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


  3.14.1. When CEA is found or located it must be reported to C-NAF/A4 (or other higher
  headquarters) as soon as possible. The C-NAF/A4 shall submit this information to the Joint
  Captured Materiel Exploitation Center (JCMEC) or Combined Captured Materiel
  Exploitation Center (CCMEC) (if a coalition operation is established) IAW paragraph
  8.2.4.2.
     3.14.1.1. Do not handle CEA when it is found. Until declared safe by EOD, treat all
     CEA in the same manner as unexploded ordnance (UXO).
     3.14.1.2. If possible, from a safe distance, identify and record pertinent facts such as the
     date, time, location (map reference), type (e.g., bomb, artillery shell, rocket, etc.),
     quantity, size, obvious markings, and other relevant information (e.g., SNs, nation of
     origin, etc.).
  3.14.2. Only competent command authorities will make determinations on whether CEA
  shall be disposed of in-place, identified or rendered safe for relocation, or retained for its
  inherent intelligence value. Munitions personnel are not authorized or qualified to make
  these decisions. Munitions personnel shall not take possession of, handle, or transport any
  CEA designated for emergency or routine disposal until rendered/declared safe by EOD.
  3.14.3. When competent authorities identify CEA to be retained for intelligence or other
  purpose, units may be directed or required to assist EOD personnel in render safe, handling,
  and relocation operations.
     3.14.3.1. Safety considerations are inherent in the responsibilities of any activity
     involved with handling CEA. Munitions personnel must exercise caution and follow
     good management practice in approaching, marking the location of, identifying,
     requesting EOD assistance, moving, storing, handling, and disposing of CEA.
     3.14.3.2. Improper handling, transportation or use of CEA may jeopardize safety and
     result in loss of personnel, equipment, and mission capability and reduce intelligence
     value.
     3.14.3.3. Under all conditions and situations, consider CEA as extremely hazardous (e.g.,
     booby-trapped) until certified safe, in writing, by EOD personnel regardless of country of
     origin. Munitions supervisors will have written certification from EOD prior to handling
     by munitions personnel or acceptance for movement and storage.
  3.14.4. When competent authorities direct CEA to be retained and it is certified safe by EOD
  personnel, it becomes the property of the United States Government and the responsibility of
  the DOD.
     3.14.4.1. It is considered unusual for CEA to be turned-over to Air Force munitions
     personnel. Rather, technically qualified personnel from other military services, coalition
     forces, or government agencies will take charge of these assets. When these activities
     take possession of CEA, responsibility of USAF munitions personnel or the MASO to
     manage and dispose of CEA is relinquished.
     3.14.4.2. Only when CEA is specifically directed by the JCMEC, CCMEC, or C-
     NAF/A4 to be retained by the USAF, will AF munitions personnel become actively
     involved in managing CEA for storage, security, and retention.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                          57


     3.14.4.3. The JCMEC, CCMEC, or C-NAF/A4 may direct CEA be courtesy stored by
     USAF munitions personnel for another military service or government agency. Only
     when CEA is specifically directed for USAF retention and/or is courtesy stored by USAF
     personnel shall CEA be accepted into the MSA for storage by munitions supervision or
     the MASO.
     3.14.4.4. CEA shall never be acquired, bought, sold, traded, disposed of or used in any
     way that deviates from existing DOD or Air Force munitions management policy.
  3.14.5. CEA should only be accounted for and managed in CAS when there is an official C-
  NAF /A3/A4 validated requirement. This requirement must be stated in a document, memo,
  or other written form, to maintain and issue CEA to USAF or other government agency
  personnel in the performance of their official duties. Under all other conditions, CEA will
  not be managed in CAS or stored in the MSA unless a Contingency Support Agreement
  (CSA) is formulated.
  3.14.6. When a valid USAF CEA requirement exists, account for CEA in CAS as follows:
     3.14.6.1. Load a local pseudo CAS IDR record for CEA with all the available
     information provided from EOD.
     3.14.6.2. Process a FOB turn-in to establish accountability of CEA.
     3.14.6.3. Follow normal CAS processes for other CAS transactions.
     3.14.6.4. Account for and inventory CEA in the same manner as other Air Force
     munitions.
     3.14.6.5. Issue CEA IAW paragraph 3.14.7.
     3.14.6.6. Dispose of CEA IAW paragraph 3.14.9.
  3.14.7. Issuing CEA.
     3.14.7.1. The Theater or Joint Captured Materiel Exploitation Center (CMEC or
     JCMEC) is the approving authority to issue or release serviceable CEA. The CMEC
     establishes the priority of issue to USAF or other government agencies.
     3.14.7.2. When a valid requirement exists and CEA is managed in CAS, issue CEA to
     organizations in the same manner as Air Force munitions.
  3.14.8. CEA Serviceability Procedure.
     3.14.8.1. Any CEA known to be unserviceable or containing physical defects or
     characteristics that cause serviceability to be suspect shall not be issued. Request

   3.17.3. The nature and extent of any maintenance or modification procedure will dictate the
   appropriate location where the maintenance is to be accomplished (e.g., Armament shop or
   MSA).
   3.17.4. Dependent upon mission, aircraft regeneration may use either the fully loaded
   carriage systems or single point delivery method to the flightline. Loaded carriage systems
   and individual miniature munitions may be delivered in or out of their respective containers.
   3.17.5. Miniature munitions will be managed by ammunition lot number according to the
   item technical order. The CAS location field may be used to identify carriage and loaded
   weapon stock number (WSN) or to identify a single miniature munition in a container.
   3.17.6. Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) GBU-39 (all variants):
      3.17.6.1. An AUR GBU-39 is one SDB in a CNU-659/E container, and will be managed
      by the appropriate AUR NSN.
      3.17.6.2. The CR GBU-39 is four AUR GBU-39s loaded on a BRU-61 carriage in a
      CNU-660/E container. The CR NSN is only used for management at the assigned depot
      location and at the base level for WRM deep storage and shipping.
      3.17.6.3. During receipt of the CR GBU-39, load all BRU-61 carriages as Container
      Type ‗AME‘ in CAS to allow Container-in-Container (CnC) management IAW
      paragraph 7.1.6.
          3.17.6.3.1. The Munitions Inspector will perform a selective identity change in CAS
          to identify each of the four munitions as an individual AUR. Then, use the ‗Add
          Weapons‘ function in CAS to load each AUR onto the BRU-61.
          3.17.6.3.2. Upon receipt of the CR GBU-39, Munitions personnel will notify the
          Armament Section to load BRU-61 carriages into the appropriate maintenance and
          inspection data system. Armament Shop personnel will ensure BRU-61 carriages are
          picked up on base supply accountable records. BRU-61 will not be accounted for in
          CAS.
      3.17.6.4. Ship individual munitions as an AUR GBU-39. Prior to shipping GBU-39s
      loaded on a BRU-61 perform a selective identity change in CAS to identify the loaded
      munitions as a CR GBU-39.
      3.17.6.5. At the base-level, process all GBU-39 expenditures against the AUR NSN.
3.18. Conventional Munitions as Critical Loads.
   3.18.1. For the purpose of maintaining materials handling and storage equipment, including
   lifting and hoisting devices, as outlined in AFOSH Standard 91-46, Materials Handling and
   Storage Equipment, the handling, lifting, and hoisting of a conventional munitions item is
   considered to be a ‗non-critical‘ load.
   3.18.2. This determination does not preclude any functional manager (e.g., unit, base, C-
   NAF, or MAJCOM) over a facility where the lifting of conventional munitions will occur
   from designating a particular lift or lifting operation as a critical load, when:
      3.18.2.1. Environmental or operational conditions are such that normal safety practices,
      existing safety rules and policies, technical procedures, or operational risk management
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                             61


      (ORM) concepts are inadequate or cannot be satisfied during lifting of conventional
      munitions.
      3.18.2.2. Damage may occur because the non-critical item must be lifted above a critical
      item (e.g., conventional loads in close proximity to a nuclear component or near
      concentrations of unrelated hazardous materials).
   3.18.3. Anytime a functional manager designates a lifting or hoisting operation as a critical
   load, the specific equipment maintenance, inspection, testing, and documentation
   requirements of AFOSH STD 91-46 shall be met.
3.19. Air Force Munitions Command and Control (MC2).
   3.19.1. Ensure all munitions squadrons and flights use the MC2 SharePoint environment.
   Lead MAJCOMs will determine if small and unique units, as defined in AFI 21-200, not
   designated as a squadron or flight and non-aircraft support units are required to use MC2
   SharePoint environment.
   3.19.2. The MC2 Incident/Accident Notification SharePoint environment at:
   https://cs.eis.af.mil/afmunitions/C2/Incident/default.aspx will be used to report munitions
   deficiencies/incidents with the following restrictions:
      3.19.2.1. Do not use this site to replace mishap/accident reporting requirements of DODI
      6055.07, Accident Investigation, Reporting, and Record Keeping, AFMAN 91-201, AFI
      91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, or T.O. 00-35D-54.
      3.19.2.2. Do not include privileged, classified, sensitive, contractor proprietary, Arms
      Export Control Act, or Privacy Act information when entering deficiency/incident
      information.
      3.19.2.3. Ensure incident information entered in SharePoint relates to and supports
      mishap prevention to avoid additional potential incidents.
      3.19.2.4. MC2 Incidents/accidents are mission related, abnormal conditions resulting in
      damage to munitions resources (i.e., munitions, equipment, vehicles, personnel, etc).
   3.19.3. When use of MC2 SharePoint environment is not available but would be otherwise
   required units shall use other means (e.g., control boards, status logs, computers, etc.) to
   maintain status of assets normally tracked using the MC2 SharePoint environment.
   3.19.4. Military, federal-civilian, and contractor users must review all MC2 Lesson Plans
   prior to gaining access to your unit‘s MC2 SharePoint environment.
3.20. Automatic Identification Technology (AIT) Enablement.
   3.20.1. AIT Equipment. AIT equipment must be evaluated for Hazards of Electromagnetic
   Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) and approved for use around ordnance.
      3.20.1.1. The HERO approval process identified any standoff distances from munitions
      items for specific equipment. Coordinate with ACC\A4WC prior to purchase of AIT
      equipment for use around munitions to ensure the HERO requirements are being met. A
      list of HERO approved device authorized for use are posted to the AF Munitions A2I
      Sharepoint site, CAS AIT Folder at: https://cs.eis.af.mil/afmunitions/A2I/default.aspx.

     3.20.1.2. Units must also coordinate purchase of AIT equipment with the local
     Communication activity.
  3.20.2. To enable current and future AIT efforts to provide automated data capture and entry
  at the Point of Maintenance (POM) several changes have been made to CAS to improve
  munitions management processes (see paragraph 7.1.7).

       Document or IMDS/G081.
       4.2.9.6. Ensure missile records are verified against assets during any maintenance
       activity. If record data does not agree with asset data, change the data in TMRS. If there
       is any questionable issue regarding asset data, contact the RAM Program Office
       immediately. If this is not possible, record the change and have a second person verify
       the reason for change (i.e., different SN), this will alleviate the need to physically re-
       verify data if a TMRS/RAM Interface Differences Report is received.
       4.2.9.7. Manage training missile SNs IAW T.O. 21M-1-101.
       4.2.9.8. After expenditure, ensure PGMs are expended in TMRS. During non-combat

                                          Chapter 7

                        MANAGING MUNITIONS OPERATIONS

7.1. Munitions Operating Procedures.
   7.1.1. Introduction. This chapter provides guidance and establishes procedures for managing
   munitions functions/activities within tactical-level (base) munitions organizations. These
   procedures integrate munitions accountability and CAS transaction processes depicted in
   Figure 7.1., Munitions Operations Flow Plan (Peacetime/Wartime). These processes apply
   to flightline and internal munitions activity during peacetime and wartime focusing on near-
   real time CAS transaction processing utilizing direct-input. HQ USAF and subordinate
   echelons to include the installation level require near-real time asset visibility. To achieve
   this, munitions transactions must be updated in CAS immediately, but not later than 1-hour to
   the maximum extent possible. The 1-hour time requirement may not be achievable in all
   situations without the use of Automated Information Technology/Systems (AIT/AIS),
   therefore, maximum utilization of available technology is desired.
      7.1.1.1. The weapons expeditor will maintain 100-percent aircraft coverage to facilitate
      CAS direct-input or relay information to Munitions Control for direct-input as an
      essential method for units to achieve streamlined information flow and near-real time
      CAS transaction processing.
      7.1.1.1. (35FW) Weapons expeditors will maintain 100-percent aircraft coverage to
      facilitate CAS direct-input. This will include aircraft munitions loads, expenditures
      (IAW paragraph 7.15.3.5.15.), cross loads, and aircraft locations. The following
      procedures will apply to munitions and aircraft movements to, on and from the flight line
      in CAS:
          7.1.1.1.1. (Added-35FW) Aircraft: All aircraft movements on the flight line will be
          accomplished by Flight line personnel. Aircraft that depart station to a TDY location
          that has an established SRAN will be imported in CAS to that location by the gaining
          location personnel. Aircraft TDY to a location without an established SRAN will be
          moved to a TDY location in CAS by Munitions Control. Munitions Control will
          monitor and update aircraft at these locations. When TDY aircraft return Munitions
          Control will import the aircraft back to the Misawa SRAN or move the aircraft back
          to the flight line location if the TDY location had no SRAN.
          7.1.1.1.2. (Added-35FW) Chaff, Flare and ALE-50‘s:           All movements for
          countermeasures will be accomplished by Munitions personnel, except when cross
          loaded from one aircraft to another. Cross loads of countermeasures will be
          accomplished by Flight line personnel. Expenditures of these assets will be
          accomplished by Munitions personnel once the assets are returned to the Munitions
          storage area.
          7.1.1.1.3. (Added-35FW) Bombs including BDU-33‘s: Munitions personnel will
          move bombs to the appropriate hardened aircraft shelter (HAS). Flight line personnel
          will load bombs on aircraft from the HAS. Flight line personnel will cross load
          bombs from one aircraft to another. When downloading, Flight line personnel will
          download bombs to the appropriate trailer. For BDU-33‘s the trailer number will be
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                               83


         provided by Munitions Control. For all other bombs, the trailer will be moved to the
         appropriate HAS by Munitions Control. Flight line personnel will process
         expenditures for expended bombs
         7.1.1.1.4. (Added-35FW) Impulse Cartridges for bombs: Munitions personnel will
         move bomb carts to the appropriate HAS for upload. Flight line personnel will
         upload all carts onto aircraft. Flight line personnel will download bomb carts to the
         appropriate trailer. For BDU-33 carts, the trailer number will be provided by
         munitions control. For all other bomb carts, the trailer will be moved to the
         appropriate HAS by Munitions Control. Flight line personnel will process
         expenditures for expended bomb carts.
         7.1.1.1.5. (Added-35FW) Missiles: Munitions personnel will move missile trailers
         to the appropriate HAS for upload. Flight line personnel will upload missiles onto
         aircraft from the trailer. Missile cross loads will be accomplished by flight line
         personnel. Missile downloads will be accomplished by flight line personnel.
         Missiles will be downloaded to the appropriate trailer. Download trailers will be
         placed at the appropriate HAS by Munitions Control. Missile expenditures will be
         processed by Flight line personnel.
         7.1.1.1.6. (Added-35FW) CAS Down Times: Prior to a scheduled CAS down time,
         Flight line personnel will ensure that assets are 100% accounted for on the flight line
         IAW with paragraphs 7.1.1.1.1 thru 7.1.1.1.5. During CAS down times all flight line
         movements will go through Munitions Control for manual tracking. After CAS is
         operational Munitions Personnel will update CAS with all manual movements, ensure
         all assets on the flight line are accounted for and inform the flight line lead that CAS
         is operational. Flight line personnel will resume flight line accountability at the time.
     7.1.1.2. Major Commands having unit‘s without aircraft or whose primary mission is
     base stockpile support operations (i.e., STAMP, theater Hubs, etc.), test and training, or
     evaluation and development programs are authorized to modify these procedures to meet
     unique mission requirements. However, if they have tenant units they must still ensure
     that near-real time CAS transactions are accomplished.
  7.1.2. Munitions Processes. Information flow is aligned to and CAS transactions are
  processed closer to the point-of-use and the use of paper/electronic forms is minimized to
  relay data more rapidly. The use of available IT/AIT capabilities, infrastructure, CAS
  complete-round (CR) management are maximized to streamline activity of munitions
  functions with increased emphasis on transaction accuracy at the point-of-use and throughout
  the entire Munitions Operations flow process.
     7.1.2.1. The custody account system will not be used to satisfy/process flightline
     demands or manage munitions within the MSA. Prior to assembly, check allocations
     (peacetime only), perform pre-use inspection IAW T.O. 11A-1-63, review CMRS, and
     validate current periodic inspection. Munitions assembled for flightline use and managed
     internally in the MSA will be managed from Stock Record Account and expended against
     the appropriate Organizational Shop Code (OSC) by CR to the fullest extent possible
     with the following exceptions:
84                                                   AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


         7.1.2.1.1. Units are authorized to manage Research, Development, Test and
         Evaluation (RDT&E) and Aging and Surveillance (A&S) munitions assets using
         custody accounts.
         7.1.2.1.2. SOCOM and AFCENT units supporting non-traditional operations may
         manage assets on custody accounts, with AFSOC/AFCENT approval.
     7.1.2.2. After an aircraft lands, reconciliation is performed by the weapons expediter.
     Every effort will be made to provide expenditure information to munitions personnel or
     process expenditures in CAS as aircraft activity occurs throughout the flying day.
         7.1.2.2.1. As a minimum, this information will be provided or processed in CAS
         between aircraft goes maximizing the use of direct-input methods IAW paragraph
         7.15.3.
         7.1.2.2.2. When downloaded, gun ammunition, and countermeasures will be returned
         to operating locations, processed, accounted for, and then expended in CAS IAW
         paragraph 7.15.3.
     7.1.2.3. All munitions operations/processes (i.e., receipts, shipments leaving the base,
     CC changes, inspections, etc.) to include those for NWRM assets will use direct-input
     methods to the maximum extent possible.
     7.1.2.4. Because CAS is a web-based system, Internet connectivity within munitions
     storage and operating areas is not optional. Connectivity is critical to safety,
     serviceability, security, and warfighting/operational capability and is required at each
     operating location. Timely and accurate munitions up-channel reporting depends on this
     connectivity. Where approved and when available, use of commercial wireless
     technology to speed data input is encouraged.
     7.1.2.5. Process Integration: Munitions supervisors and managers must integrate these
     processes into their sections, elements, and crew procedures, operational processes, and
     training plans to ensure all personnel working within the Munitions Operations Flow
     process are knowledgeable. Personnel must understand that munitions processes occur
     continuously, overlap, and are initiated and completed throughout every step of the
     munitions operational flow process.
     7.1.2.6. Nuclear Weapons Related Material (NWRM) Management:                  Effective
     management, Positive Inventory Control (PIC) and Total Asset Visibility (TAV) is
     required for all NWRM. This instruction focuses on management of NWRM items
     managed within CAS. Primary policies for NWRM management are included within
     AFI 20-110, AFMAN 23-110, AFI 24-203 and this instruction. Unless specifically
     addressed in this instruction, refer to these publications for NWRM management.
  7.1.3. Direct-Input Methods: Direct-input methods are used to the maximum extent that
  Internet access, radio, telephone, AIT, and the use of runners allow. Management controls
  should not inhibit the use of direct-input methods. Rather, emphasis on point-of-use
  validation of data prior to processing transactions in CAS at all steps in the process provides
  the level of accuracy desired using the direct-input method. The CAS processing activity
  may be the worker, supervisor or crew chief performing the task, munitions control, storage
  dispatch, assembly pad supervisor, processing bay chief, munitions inspector, or any other
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                               85


  individual designated by Munitions Supervision to perform these activities. Direct-input
  processing may involve all of the following:
     7.1.3.1. Internet Access. Personnel that have a valid CAC card and an Air Force Portal
     account and are authorized to process CAS transactions can do so at any location where
     Internet access is available by signing on the web-enabled CAS system. Weapons
     expeditors and other personnel performing munitions tasks and operations input CAS
     transaction data directly into CAS from or near work locations.
     7.1.3.2. After validation of data, technicians, expeditors and supervisors may use LMR,
     telecommunication, or runners to provide transaction data to Munitions Control or other
     applicable activity for CAS processing. Ensure OPSEC is maintained at all times.
     7.1.3.3. Automatic Identification Technology (AIT): After validation that tasks are
     completed, technicians, expeditors, and supervisors use automated hardware and software
     applications to transmit transaction data into CAS automatically. This data may be saved
     in the hardware memory to be downloaded into CAS later or transmitted immediately
     through hard-wired or USAF approved wireless technology to a base Local Area
     Network (LAN) or Wide Area Network (WAN).
  7.1.4. Single-Integrated Munitions Process. These processes are utilized by all munitions
  activities in peacetime and in wartime, at home-station and at deployed locations using a
  single web-enabled information system and a single-integrated set of munitions transaction
  processes. Activities supporting aircraft operations focus support towards sortie generation
  operations (see Figure 7.2., Sortie Generation Sequence of Events (Peacetime and Wartime).
  Activities supporting non-aircraft operations focus support towards their mission objectives
  (i.e., out-load, receipt, stockpile surveillance and maintenance, transit (port/hub) operations,
  etc.).
     7.1.4.1. Munitions Sections and Elements: Specific responsibilities of munitions
     sections/elements are detailed in AFI 21-101, AFI 21-200, this chapter and chapters 4, 5,
     and 6 of this instruction.
     7.1.4.2. Weapons Expeditors. Expeditors manage munitions assets on the flightline.
     Expeditors reconcile and process munitions movement and aircraft expenditure
     transactions in CAS on the flightline as soon as possible but no later than between aircraft
     goes; or immediately relay this transaction data directly to Munitions Control.
     7.1.4.3. During sortie generation operations, assure maximum aircraft coverage by
     organizing and positioning expeditors functionally, geographically, or spatially
     depending on mission requirements and general airfield layout. This is a critical node in
     the flightline reconciliation process and will maximize accuracy and validity of aircraft
     load/expenditure data prior to processing transactions in CAS.
  7.1.5. Structure Management. All munitions facilities, revetments/pads, Hardened Aircraft
  Structures (HAS)/Protective Aircraft Structures (PAS), aircraft parking spots, and holding
  areas for munitions, will be loaded as individual CAS structures. This process allows assets
  to be moved between structures using the normal CAS Movement Process (AM104A) and
  enables the use of CAS management products to track assembled assets in their physical
  location using the Storage Location Report (AM567A). In addition, a structure titled ‗Off-
86                                                   AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


  Station‘ may be created for assets currently ‗off station‘ and awaiting receipt by an FOL or
  due to return to the base.
  7.1.6. Container-in-Container (CnC) Management. This change to CAS provides a parent-
  child relationship that enables the movement of a container and its contents in a single move,
  where the N.E.W., compatibility and CIIC of the contents are applied to the container‘s
  location within a structure.
     7.1.6.1. Containers are classified by ‗type‘ and ‗sub-type‘ to improve overall
     management of containers. Templates and naming conventions for container types and
     sub-types are pre-defined in CAS to standardize these across the Air Force. If container
     types or sub-types do not support requirements, contact your MAJCOM. For example:
     Container Type                        Container Sub-Type
     Aircraft                              B-1B, F-15C, F-16B30, etc.
     Trailer                               MHU-110, MHU-196, 40ft, etc.
     ISO                                   USUF; 20ft side opener; 20ft end opener, etc.
     AME                                   RLA, LAU-131, BRU-44, etc.

     7.1.6.2. AME container ID formats are provided by HQ ACC/A4WA and loaded on the
     AF/ A4LW CoP. If container types, sub-types, or container IDs do not support
     requirements, contact your MAJCOM who will work through ACC/A4WC to add or
     change container types/sub-types and identify new container ID codes.
     7.1.6.3. For containers currently loaded as structures containing assets; create new
     container IDs IAW the following procedures and move assets to the newly created
     container before deleting the structure in CAS.
     7.1.6.4. Once loaded, a container ID carries a maintenance detail record. While not
     mandatory to update, they enable additional capabilities. The maintenance detail record
     varies based on container type. Aircraft detail records have information on the owning
     organization and allow the ORG/SHP code and munitions CAT Codes to be specified for
     all expenditures processed against the given container ID. An ISO detail record is used to
     update container information necessary to ship a loaded or empty container. All detail
     records provides the capability to check the contents being moved into it against a
     specified Complete Round Weapons Code (CRWC) or codes.
     7.1.6.5. Container IDs may be added or deleted from the system as needed by the using
     organization. Items in the context of CnC are not accountable in CAS.
         7.1.6.5.1. An accountable container may be assigned a container ID for ease of
         tracking, however it is the stock level of this NSN that is accountable, not the CnC
         container ID.
         7.1.6.5.2. Once the container ID is assigned the accountable NSN would be moved
         into the container ID, pairing the two together to make it easier to track and utilize.
     7.1.6.6. Individual Container Identification. A unique 10-digit identifier must be
     assigned to each container managed in CAS and cannot be duplicated, regardless of type
     or sub-type. Each unit will load individual containers by appropriate container type and
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                                 87


       sub-type using Container Maintenance (AM106A). Container ID Naming Conventions
       will be standardized across the USAF enterprise as follows:
           7.1.6.6.1. Aircraft. Load the two-digit aircraft wing designator ‗tail flash‘ as position
           1 and 2 (i.e., Langley = FF), the two-digit year as position 3 and 4 (i.e., 1989 = 89),
           and a 6-digit aircraft tail number as position 5 thru 10 (i.e., FF89123456). Note: If a
           ‗duplication‘ error is received in CAS contact the MAJCOM. Units without assigned
           aircraft contact the MAJCOM for a tail flash designator. Units are not required to
           update Aircraft container locations in CAS.
Note: All AFSOC units will use ‗XX‘ as their Wing designator for all container types.
           7.1.6.6.2. Trailers. Load the two-position wing designator as position 1 and 2, the
           three-digit trailer type as position 3 thru 5, and the five-digit assigned SN as position
           6 thru 10 (e.g., FF11012345 = MHU-110 or FF25F12345 = 25FT). Units will update
           Trailer container locations in CAS.
           7.1.6.6.3. Transportation Modules (Mods). Load the two-position wing designator as
           position 1 and 2, the three-digit module type as position 3 thru 5, and the five-digit
           assigned SN as position 6 thru 10 (e.g., FFB3312345 = BDU-33, FFRKT12345 =
           rockets, or FFC-F12345 = Chaff-Flare). Note: Units that have loaded containers
           under Chaff and/or Flare type must move the containers to the ‗Chaff-Flare‘ type.
           Units will update Module container locations in CAS.
           7.1.6.6.4. Ammunition Loaders. Load the two-position wing designator as position 1
           and 2, the three-digit loader type as position 3 thru 5, and the five-digit assigned SN
           as position 6 thru 10 (e.g., FFALS12345 = ALS, FFLAL12345 = LAL, or
           FFUAL12345 = UALS). Units will update Ammunition Loader container locations
           in CAS.
           7.1.6.6.5. Alternate Mission Equipment (AME) to include Chaff/Flare Magazines.
           Load the two-position wing designator as position 1 and 2, the three-digit AME type
           as position 3 thru 5, and the five-digit assigned SN as position 6 thru 10 (e.g.,
           FFL8812345 = LAU-88, FFA5012345 = ALE-50, FFCFM12345 = Chaff/Flare
           magazine). Note: All AME container ID formats will be provided by HQ
           ACC/A4WA and loaded on the AF/A4LW CoP. Units are not required to update
           AME container locations in CAS.
           7.1.6.6.6. ISO Containers. Load the four-digit ISOs designator as position 1 thru 4
           (e.g., USAF or USFU) and the 6-digit SN as position 5 thru 10 (i.e. USAF123456).
           Units will update ISO container locations in CAS.
   7.1.7. Automatic Identification Technology (AIT): AIT capabilities are under development
   to automate data entry processes and are planned for introduction into CAS programs and
   munitions processes in FY2010. In addition to technical-procedural guidance for the use of
   AIT equipment on the AF/A4LW CoP on the Air Force portal, the following guidance will
   be used:
       7.1.7.1. CAS release 2.1.2 has the capability to print two-dimensional AIT barcode
       labels for warehouses, containers, WSN, assets, and consolidated assets (multiple NSNs).
       However, currently fielded printers may not be compatible or have the capability to
88                                                  AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


     accurately print specific AIT labels. Units should contact their MAJCOM if they desire
     to utilize this CAS capability before standardized USAF equipment and materials are
     provided to them.
     7.1.7.2. Standardized label equipment and labels have been identified and the
     MAJCOMs are working to field this AIT equipment; units should not purchase their own
     AIT equipment.
        7.1.7.2.1. AIT Labels: To automate the data entry process, two dimensional barcode
        labels are used with human readable data. Barcode data identifiers tell the handheld
        terminal (HHT) scanner what type of data is being read and where it should be placed
        on the HHT screen. CAS provides the user the capability to print the following labels
        using a desktop printer or a hip printer attached to the HHT.
        7.1.7.2.2. Warehouse Label: The warehouse label contains the structure and
        location, and when scanned displays the contents of that location. These labels will
        be placed on corner markers to identify a specific structure location. If corner
        markers cannot be utilized, affix labels to walls, clipboards, signs, or other means to
        clearly display labels to meet operational needs.
        7.1.7.2.3. Container Label: The container label contains the container ID and IUID,
        and when scanned displays the container and any assets within the container. The
        container label should be placed near the field number or location that best facilitates
        visibility and ease of use.
        7.1.7.2.4. WSN Label: The WSN label contains a WSN, and when scanned will
        select that specific WSN.
        7.1.7.2.5. Asset Label: The asset label contains the mandatory data elements for
        marking munitions packing IAW MIL-STD 129. All available asset information is
        pre-populated based on the indicative data record and user input. All data elements
        are editable and users must ensure that data is accurate. The asset label can be
        generated for all levels of packaging. The label contains a unique traceability code to
        prevent duplicate scanning. The user must ensure labels are replaced on the front and
        side of containers.
        7.1.7.2.6. Consolidated Asset Label. The consolidated asset label provides the same
        capability as the Asset Label except it allows multiple NSNs to be added to the label.
     7.1.7.3. Aircraft Expenditures. To support munitions expenditures using the HHT, the
     ORG/SHP code and Munitions CAT Code must be loaded against a specific aircraft
     (Container ID) data record. If the ORG/SHP code and Munitions CAT Code are not
     loaded the transaction will error out and be retained in the CAS AIT Conflict Resolution
     (AMP09A) program.
     7.1.7.4. AIT Conflict Resolution (AMP09A). In an off-line environment, transactions
     must be processed using AIT in the chronological sequence that they actually occur.
        7.1.7.4.1. To support the automated data capture process in an off-line environment it
        is possible that a transaction created by one user may not process is CAS because the
        transaction is dependent upon the processing of another user‘s transaction. For
        example: In an off-line mode, Crew 1 moves a loaded trailer from an operating
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                             89


         location (OL1) to a holding pad (HP1) and then crew 2 moves the trailer from (HP1)
         to a flightline location (S1). If crew 2 processes the trailer movement from HP1 to
         S1, CAS would create an error, since CAS would still show the trailer in OL1. Crew
         1 must process the first transaction (OL1 to HP1) before crew 2 can process the
         second transaction.
         7.1.7.4.2. Units using AIT must monitor the AIT Conflict Resolution program to
         ensure transactions are being cleared and updated to clear outstanding transactions.
     7.1.7.5. Units must develop processes to ensure off-line transactions are processed at
     sufficient intervals necessary to support the mission.
  7.1.8. The Munitions Operations Flow Process. A specific sequence of munitions operations
  and actions must occur to effectively support aircraft sortie generation or other operational
  missions. Although the sequence or assignment of responsibilities may differ based on local
  conditions, each of these steps are essential to attain near-real time transaction processing,
  accurate accountability, and asset visibility. Major process phases include: Planning,
  Execution, and the Data Entry. Each step in the Execution phase will generally require
  completion of the Data Entry phase as depicted in Figure 7.1.
     7.1.8.1. Planning Phase. Refer to Figure 7.1.
         7.1.8.1.1. Demand/Requirements. Munitions requirements for external support are
         received from supported organizations and agencies. Munitions requirements for
         internal munitions activity are derived through the munitions scheduling process,
         typically as receipt, shipping, maintenance, inspection, or warehousing tasks.
 90                                                AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


Figure 7.1. Munitions Operations Flow Plan (Peacetime/Wartime).




             7.1.8.1.1.1. Requirements to support sortie generation are normally received in
             the form of an Air Tasking Order (ATO), flying schedule, or through AF IMT
             2407, Weekly/Daily Flying Schedule Coordination.              When received, the
             controlling activity, generally munitions control, must evaluate and convert
             requirements and prioritize individual builds to support aircraft sorties.
             7.1.8.1.1.2. Requirements to support custody accounts are received by munitions
             operations or munitions control from the account custodian through electronic or
             other communications. These requirements are processed in CAS by munitions
             operations or munitions control personnel, added to the munitions schedule as
             scheduled or unscheduled tasks, and accomplished to meet the customer demand.
             Processes should focus on meeting customer demands quickly and efficiently.
             Customer support should not be delayed by internal scheduling processes or
             management controls.
             7.1.8.1.1.3. Requirements to support internal munitions activity are typically
             forecasted and scheduled in quarterly, monthly, and weekly/production schedules
             or may be unscheduled. Integrate these requirements with external support
             schedules to effectively meet all workloads.
             7.1.8.1.1.4. (Added-35FW) Flying unit Schedulers will provide Munitions
             Control with number of captive air training missiles (CATMs) required for TDY,
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                            91


            at least 14 days prior to scheduled departure.
            7.1.8.1.1.5. (Added-35FW) Flying unit Schedulers will provide Munitions
            Control notification for use of new Complete Round Code munitions or any
            change from existing requirements 14 days prior to scheduled requirement.
            7.1.8.1.1.6. (Added-35FW) 35 OSS/OSK will provide Munitions Control with
            complete round codes for planned munitions expenditures 21 days out. 35
            OSS/OSK will provide Munitions Control with changes to complete round codes
            for the following week NLT OG/MXG scheduling meeting.
            7.1.8.1.1.7. (Added-35FW) Ensure training munitions are loaded only on
            aircraft scheduled to fly in the current printed flying schedule. Schedule changes
            involving aircraft, munitions loads, additions, etc. will be coordinated through
            Munitions Control. A routed and approved AF Form 2407, Weekly/Daily Flying
            Schedule Coordination must be provided to Munitions Control before delivery of
            any additional munitions.
            7.1.8.1.1.8. (Added-35FW) Munitions-loaded aircraft not on the next day‘s
            flying schedule, but scheduled to fly later the same week may remain loaded.
        7.1.8.1.2. Check Allocations: During peacetime operations, remaining allocations
        must be validated by the controlling function before assets are delivered using the
        Level Reconciliation Listing (AMC12A) to ensure munitions are not expended
        without an approved allocation. All munitions functions that handle, process, deliver
        and support flightline munitions have responsibilities to ensure that approved
        allocations are not exceeded.
        7.1.8.1.3. Asset Availability: After determining requirements, the next step is to
        determine asset availability. Review CAS for pre-built assets that satisfy the
        requirements using Complete Round Query (AM522A), CRC Asset Summary
        (AM523A), etc. Select and utilize available assets as appropriate. If additional assets
        are required, determine whether components are available to satisfy the remaining
        requirement using Complete Round Analyzer (AMR01A), Complete Round Build
        (AMJ01A), etc.
        7.1.8.1.4. Prioritize and Schedule Support Activities. This step involves determining
        the optimal sequence of events to meet all mission requirements. Local munitions
        managers make these decisions utilizing available CAS data, reports, and leadership
        guidance. Up to date and accurate CAS data is essential for proper decision making
        in munitions support operations.
     7.1.8.2. Execution Phase. Refer to Figure 7.1.
        7.1.8.2.1. Break-Out Assets, Deliver and Relay Movement Data. Stockpile
        movement activity in support of aircraft sortie generation, other operational missions,
        or routine stockpile maintenance and inspection will utilize direct-input methods to
        the maximum extent possible.
            7.1.8.2.1.1. This flow applies to sortie generation and internal munitions
            operations at all times and locations. Each segment of the Execution Phase may
            require movement data entry into CAS as depicted in Figure 7.2.
92                                             AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


        7.1.8.2.1.2. For assembly and build locations, follow the established location
        management system for operating locations.
        7.1.8.2.1.3. Notify Munitions Control to update appropriate fire symbol, hazard
        marker, and CIIC changes as required.
     7.1.8.2.2. Perform appropriate inspection and preparation - relay CC changes.
        7.1.8.2.2.1. Refer to appropriate technical orders for serviceability inspection
        criteria for built-up munitions.
        7.1.8.2.2.2. After performing required inspections according to T.O. 11A-1-10
        and T.O. 11A-1-63 and any required preparatory or maintenance actions, update
        CAS within 1- hour to the maximum extent possible with appropriate asset
        condition changes or relay this data to the controlling activity for direct-input.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                          93


Figure 7.2. Sortie Generation Sequence of Events (Peacetime and Wartime).




          7.1.8.2.3. Determine CR batch quantity and relay for WSN build and assemble.
          After processing movement transactions in CAS for components delivered to
          assembly locations, begin the CAS CR build-up process.
             7.1.8.2.3.1. Assembly supervisor must ensure the components used to build CRs
             are properly identified. A WSN is a 14-digit code identifying the CRWC,
             SRAN/DODAAC and batch number. CAS assigns a WSN for each build
             utilizing the same lot number of like components per similar CRWC.
             7.1.8.2.3.2. The actual CR assembly in CAS may take place either before, during,
94                                               AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


        or after the assembly of physical assets. However, to prevent mixing WSNs of
        CRs, the best practice is to process the CR assembly in CAS prior to beginning
        the physical assembly process. Regardless whether the CR assembly is processed
        in CAS during or after physical assembly, care must be taken to ensure a new,
        unique WSN is generated when batch (lots) are depleted during the CR build.
        Document all CR assembly processes on an AF IMT 4331 (MTS) if CAS is not
        available, update CAS as soon as it becomes available.
        7.1.8.2.3.3. When a CAS generated WSN is assigned, each CR will be properly
        marked with an abbreviated WSN consisting of the CRWC and the last three
        digits of the WSN (i.e., BL2CM-XXX). Unless prohibited by the item T.O. the
        CR will be conspicuously marked. Marking of WSN on chaff/flare magazine,
        2.75" rockets, BDU-33 practice bombs, and 105MM rounds is not required.
        7.1.8.2.3.4. When CAS is not available a temporary WSN will be assigned and
        annotated on each CR. A ‗T‘ designator will be placed between the CRWC and
        batch number signifying it a Temporary WSN (BL2CM-TXXX). When CAS
        becomes available and a permanent WSN is assigned, the temporary WSN on
        each CR is not required to be remarked with the permanent WSN as long as a
        temporary and permanent WSN cross-reference list is maintained.
        7.1.8.2.3.5. Additional CR configuration suffix markings used in conjunction
        with the abbreviated WSN are authorized to distinguish between a CR wired for
        triple-ejection racks (TER) or parent-mount racks and/or fin X-position or +-
        position configuration. For example, a CR marked with ‗BC21H-35T+‘ identifies
        a conical MK 82 wired for a TER with the fin in the + position configuration.
        7.1.8.2.3.6. Missiles are AURs and will not be converted to CRs in CAS.
        Manage Ready-use missiles in CAS by NSN and SN.
     7.1.8.2.4. Finalize CR and Relay Movement Data. After CR munitions are
     assembled, they will move from the assembly pad to trailers, holding areas, or storage
     locations and ultimately to aircraft parking locations for aircraft loading. Since all of
     these locations, including trailers and aircraft, are loaded in CAS as containers,
     accomplish this by processing a movement transaction in CAS.
        7.1.8.2.4.1. CR Movements. For CRs, use abbreviated WSN showing the CRWC
        and WSN in the CAS location. For example: BL2CM-XXX. Exception: This is
        not required for CnC moves as CAS provides the default locations.
        7.1.8.2.4.2. Validating Munitions Movements. Munitions managers, sections,
        and work centers must use the Storage Location Report (AM567A) to assist in
        reconciling assets in operating locations. Operating locations should be
        inventoried daily to ensure movement processing and location accuracy.
     7.1.8.2.5. Receive, Ship, Expend Asset. An event causing physical stockpile balance
     changes that result in the processing of an accountable CAS transaction.
     7.1.8.2.6. Reconcile Munitions Transaction. This is the process of validating
     accuracy of actions from the previous step (paragraph 7.1.8.2.5.) to ensure assets
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                           95


        were actually received, shipped, or expended, etc. to ensure the accuracy of the event
        data prior to CAS processing.
            7.1.8.2.6.1. Reconciliation occurs throughout the munitions process flow and not
            at the end of the flying or working day.
            7.1.8.2.6.2. Aircraft Munitions Reconciliation: As aircraft land throughout the
            flying day, reconciliation is performed to identify, validate, and process
            expenditures using direct-input or relayed to a CAS processing activity. As a
            minimum, this information is processed between aircraft goes.
            7.1.8.2.6.3. Transaction Validation. Validation of the actual transaction involves
            reviewing completed tasks and processes to assure 100-percent accuracy before
            using direct-input. For example, an individual responsible for processing must
            query CAS to determine the assets previously loaded on an aircraft prior to
            processing an expenditure. A similar validation must be completed for every task
            performed and is essential to ensure accuracy of transactions processed in CAS.
            It involves all personnel performing munitions tasks and processes.
     7.1.8.3. Data Entry Phase. (Refer to Figure 7.1.)
        7.1.8.3.1. Annotate/Record Data. This step involves documenting munitions activity
        data as it occurs and is accomplished by all involved in munitions operational
        processes. When direct-input methods are used, it is not necessary to record data for
        every munitions task. Recording munitions data is completed when required for
        auditable documentation or when determined necessary by munitions managers or
        MASO to validate data accuracy for input into CAS.
        7.1.8.3.2. Direct-input is the preferred method, however munitions managers must
        decide what level and amount of data record is desired to validate munitions activity
        and CAS transactions. Avoid and discourage excessive management and
        documentation controls that delays or hinders process execution.
        7.1.8.3.3. The AF IMT 4331, Munitions Transaction Sheet (MTS): The AF IMT
        4331 (MTS) is a multi-purpose form designed to record all types of munitions
        transaction/data for general, accountable, and auditable munitions activity during
        peacetime and wartime. The MTS is also a management tool that facilitates the
        validation of CAS transaction processing. If direct-input or automatic processing is
        used, use of the AF IMT 4331 (MTS) is not required. If used, the AF IMT 4331
        (MTS) will be retained until the 100-percent movement validation is completed IAW
        paragraph 5.2.6.
            7.1.8.3.3.1. Recording of custody account movements on the MTS applies only to
            movement of custody assets stored within the Munitions Storage Area, initial
            transfer to the custodian, and physical receipts of assets from the custodian.
            7.1.8.3.3.2. MAJCOMS may authorize local modification to the AF IMT 4331
            (MTS) as long as the original data elements are included.
            7.1.8.3.3.3. Routing of the AF IMT 4331 (MTS) shall be identified in Document
            Flow procedures and the Movement Control OI.
            7.1.8.3.3.4. Documenting the AF IMT 4331 (MTS): The first six blocks of the
 96                                                  AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


             MTS are administrative in nature and determine what process the form will be
             used to record. The remaining blocks are used to capture individual transaction
             data related to that process. Each line is capable of recording all the necessary
             information to process a single transaction in CAS and is self-explanatory.
      7.1.8.4. Validate Data: It is essential that transactions are processed in CAS accurately.
      This step involves all actions, measures, and management controls deemed necessary to
      ensure data is accurate before processing in CAS. This step includes all flightline
      activities, reconciliation processes, and physical measures to validate data.
      7.1.8.5. Enter Data in CAS. This step culminates all previous actions and steps within
      the Munitions Operations Flow Plan. When data is entered (processed) into CAS,
      changes to the asset posture, stockpile balances, asset condition, resupply, and
      availability for use are affected.
          7.1.8.5.1. These changes become visible to stockpile managers at all levels and may
          impact logistics support decisions by the unit, Wing, C-NAF Theater/Regional
          Ammunition Control Points (TACP/RACP), MAJCOM, GACP, and HQ USAF.
          7.1.8.5.2. Although, near-real time CAS transaction processing is desired, processing
          inaccurate or erroneous data in CAS is counter-productive to base, theater,
          MAJCOM, and Air Force logistics processes. Munitions managers at the tactical-
          level must ensure effective validation processes are in-place and understood by all
          personnel who are designated/authorized to submit/process CAS transactions.
      7.1.8.6. Validate Accuracy of Data Entry. This step is performed to provide the MASO
      and munitions manager‘s confidence that transactions in CAS history have been
      processed properly and accurately. It allows munitions managers to identify negative
      CAS processing trends and take immediate corrective action where and when necessary.
          7.1.8.6.1. MASO Validation of Flightline Munitions Activity. The Transaction
          History Report (AM903A) must be compared against the AF IMT 2434 or other
          documents and discrepancies researched and corrected.
          7.1.8.6.2. Validation of Internal Munitions Activity. Physically validate and
          document AM903A for 10-percent of all storage movements for accuracy and
          completion each week. This involves the physical validation of the actual location
          against the location reflected in CAS.
      7.1.8.7. Route Documents to Appropriate Authority. Routing of documents represents
      the final step in a Munitions Operations Flow Plan process. Elimination and reduction of
      paper documents within the Munitions Operations Flow Plan remains an important goal,
      however, certain accountable and auditable documents or other documents key to
      management review and validation must be routed to appropriate activities. Routing of
      documents, document flow, and document control procedures are provided in paragraph
      7.8.
7.2. MASO Management of Munitions and Combat Ammunition System Procedure.
   7.2.1. Establish a SRAN/DODAAC IAW paragraph 9.2.
   7.2.2. The MASO operates the munitions account and may pre-appoint delegates, in writing,
   to operate and manage account activity to include signing specified documents and listings.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                          97


  The MASO will sign the certificate of transfer and all inventory adjustments. Specific
  MASO accomplished tasks and authorities/responsibilities that may be delegated are outlined
  within Table 7.1. The MASO ensures required documentation is signed IAW Table 7.3.
     7.2.2.1. The term ―MASO will‖ indicates a task/responsibility accomplished by the
     MASO. These tasks can only be delegated when the MASO is absent from the duty
     section for at least one entire duty day. This ‗absence‘ rule applies to MASO
     accomplished tasks listed in the left column of Table 7.1.
     7.2.2.2. The term ―MASO must ensure‖ indicates a task/responsibility that the MASO
     may delegate even when not absent from the duty section. These tasks are listed in the
     right column of Table 7.1.
     7.2.2.3. Regardless of delegation authority, the MASO is responsible for account
     management and ensuring a clear understanding of responsibility and authority that
     accompanies each level of delegation.
          98                                                                AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010

                                                                  7.4.5.3.
                                                                                 have been corrected or assets are turned in

                   7.2.2.1.4. If clear responsibility and authority cannot be maintained during a period
                   of delegation, Munitions Supervision or the MASO should advise the appointing
                   authority to consider transferring the account to a new MASO.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                              99


     7.2.2.2. Only an NCO, Officer, or civilian having a detailed working knowledge of
     munitions accountability procedures will be given MASO delegation. MAJCOMs may
     approve deviations to this requirement.
  7.2.3. The MASO must ensure that munitions owning and using organizations are familiar
  with the policies, responsibilities, and procedures within this instruction. In addition to the
  responsibilities outlined on the AF Form 68, the MASO shall ensure organizational
  commanders and custodians are aware of the Munitions Customer Information Matrix
  provided at attachment 5. When used in conjunction with the briefing topics on the AF Form
  68, this matrix replaces the requirement to develop a separate Munitions Customer Guide.
  Units who develop separate Munitions Customer Guides to aid customers will review and
  update these guides IAW AFI 33-363.
  7.2.4. The MASO ensures processes are established to post munitions transactions in CAS as
  near to real-time as possible with a goal of 1-hour.
  7.2.5. Base-Level CAS System Management. Refer to paragraph 9.3 and paragraph 13.2 for
  additional guidance on 754 Electronic Systems Group (ELSG), C-NAF, MAJCOM, GACP
  and HQ USAF management and responsibilities for CAS. Base-level munitions supervision
  and managers will:
     7.2.5.1. Ensure all CAS base administrators are thoroughly briefed on specific computer
     training and awareness issues as outlined in AFI 33-200, Information Assurance (IA)
     Management.
     7.2.5.2. Appointment of Local Administrator. The MASO appoints a primary and at least
     one alternate local administrator in writing. Also see paragraph 2.6.10 and paragraph
     9.3.2.
         7.2.5.2.1. Standard memorandum format will be used and will identify the appointed
         individuals name, rank, SRAN/DODAAC, Unit, Office Symbol, DSN phone number,
         Portal Login ID, and Security Clearance.
         7.2.5.2.2. Forward a copy of the appointment memorandum to the MAJCOM SA.
         Submit new or updated memorandums as changes occur.
         7.2.5.2.3. The MAJCOM SA grants the primary and alternate base-level
         administrator the CAS Admin privilege if the local administrators Global Combat
         Support System – Air Force (GCSS-AF) IF logins are assigned and the appointment
         memorandum has been received and validated. If no local SA is assigned/available,
         the Lead MAJCOM SA grants base-level administrators in their absence.
             7.2.5.2.3.1. Once the administrative role is assigned to the local SA and appears
             in the SA Air Force Portal account, he or she will then be able to access the admin
             menu and have the ability to grant CAS privileges to other base-level users. The
             individuals appointed as the local SA will be the POC for all matters relating to
             the CAS application for their unit.
             7.2.5.2.3.2. The primary and alternate SA are granted unique roles; therefore,
             ensure a SA is available for daily CAS support as needed. The SA grants local
             users access to specific shop-related roles.
 100                                                 AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


          7.2.5.2.4. The Base Level SA is required to validate local CAS user listing quarterly
          to ensure accuracy.
7.3. Preparation and Use of the AF Form 68, Munitions Authorization Record.
   7.3.1. Purpose: The AF Form 68 is used by organizational commanders to establish all
   custody and consumption accounts, appoint munitions custodians, identify personnel
   currently authorized to receipt for munitions, and authorize user access to CAS for managing
   custody/consumption accounts or personnel outside the Munitions organization (including
   tenant units).
       7.3.1.1. An AF Form 68 is not required to satisfy/process flightline demands or
       munitions managed within the MSA.
       7.3.1.2. The AF Form 68 will be used for custody accounts established by units to
       manage RDT&E and A&S munitions assets IAW the exceptions to paragraph 7.1.2.1.
       7.3.1.3. Personnel not on AF Form 68, may be granted CAS access when requested
       (memorandum or e-mail) by the users' Commander (or equivalent) and approved by the
       MASO. The access request must contain the requestor's full name, grade, Air Force
       Portal ID and duty phone number.
   7.3.2. Responsibilities.
       7.3.2.1. Commanders of units that ‗use‘ or ‗possess‘ munitions will sign and ensure
       compliance with requirements of the AF Form 68, references in the Munitions Customer
       Information Matrix at attachment 5, and any local MASO requirements.
          7.3.2.1.1. Civil service (GS/GM) personnel appointed as Division heads/chiefs
          within a military unit may sign the AF Form 68 in lieu of the Commander. In
          contracted operations a military officer holding command authority or Federal
          civilian (GS/GM) Division heads/chief will sign the AF Form 68. Contractors do not
          sign to appoint custodians or approve the AF Form 68.
          7.3.2.1.2. In their absence, commanders may delegate authority to sign the AF Form
          68 by using G-series orders. Civil Service (GS/GM) personnel will delegate authority
          by memorandum. A copy of the G-series orders or the memorandum will be
          provided to the MASO. Personnel on G-series orders or delegation memorandum
          must sign an addendum to the current AF Form 68 to acknowledge being briefed and
          trained.
          7.3.2.1.3. Delegation of authority does not release the commander from pecuniary
          liability.
       7.3.2.2. Personnel with operational or supervisory responsibility for the base/wing
       command post, small arms range, disaster preparedness, AFE, or combat control teams
       may act as the commander to sign the AF Form 68. Authority may also be delegated in
       writing to EOD flight chiefs.
       7.3.2.3. Commanders may elect to personally receipt for munitions, or delegate their
       authority. Organizational Commanders must develop internal management controls
       within their unit to provide oversight and comply with all munitions account
       responsibilities.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                             101


      7.3.2.4. Active, guard, reserve, and civilian personnel operationally aligned within the
      same functional area will be combined on a single AF Form 68 (or addendum) regardless
      of administrative alignment.
      7.3.2.5. The MASO must ensure a ‗face to face‘ briefing and informational training on
      custody account responsibilities is provided to the organizational or unit commander and
      all custodians utilizing the AF Form 68, Part II, Briefing Statement, attachment 5 of this
      publication, and the Air Force Munitions Accountability Procedures Guide located on
      AF/A4LW CoP.
          7.3.2.5.1. By signing the AF Form 68, all individuals acknowledge understanding of
          the instructions and responsibilities listed on the AF Form 68 and in attachment 5.
          Provide customers a listing of Munitions key points of contact for normal and after
          hours support.
          7.3.2.5.2. When personnel on G-series orders must sign account documents, the
          MASO ensures they are briefed and trained IAW these procedures.
      7.3.2.6. The MASO reviews the AF Form 68 for completeness and accuracy and signs to
      approve establishment or continuance of a custody/consumption account. The MASO
      signs after all other individuals have signed and prior to account personnel taking custody
      of munitions. The MASO returns incomplete/inaccurate AF Forms 68 to the unit for
      correction before signing. Individuals cannot be added to the AF Form 68 once approved
      by the MASO. All custodians are considered ‗primary‘; there are no alternate custodians.
          7.3.2.6.1. If additional custodians must be added to the account, accomplish a new
          AF Form 68 or process an ‗Addendum‘ AF Form 68. If an addendum is used to add
          personnel, it is marked as ―Addendum‖ and filed with the original.
          7.3.2.6.2. If a custodian‘s authorization is withdrawn by the appointing authority or
          any appointed custodian is reassigned or departs station, the unit will complete and
          electronically submit a new AF Form 68 to the MASO for approval. The MASO will
          digitally sign the new AF Form 68 and ensure it is posted on the shared drive for
          access by all users (e.g., custodian, inspection, storage, SA).
          7.3.2.6.3. AF Form 68 will be revalidated annually and will be re-accomplished
          when the commander changes.
      7.3.2.7. Units shall use the folder structure as outlined in the AF Munitions Document
      Control Guide for AF Form 68 distribution. Ensure that Munitions Inspection, Storage,
      account custodian, SA, and the custody account monitor have ‗read‘ privileges for the
      account document folders.
7.4. Custody Account Management.
   7.4.1. The Organization commander is responsible for munitions issued to the unit‘s custody
   accounts. Commanders appoint munitions account custodians using the AF Form 68.
   7.4.2. Custodians are responsible to the unit commander for property management and are
   liable for loss, damage or destruction of property resulting from negligence, willful
   misconduct or deliberate unauthorized use.
102                                                   AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


  7.4.3. Custodians will comply with all requirements identified on the AF Form 68 and this
  instruction:
      7.4.3.1. Ensure allocations are not exceeded.
      7.4.3.2. Obtain or provide transportation to pick up and deliver required munitions to and
      from the MSA.
      7.4.3.3. Maintain lot number integrity (i.e., do not mix lots). This is especially important
      for munitions items that the lot number is not affixed to the actual munitions item.
      Example: Small arms ammunition in operational use loaded into magazines will be
      managed utilizing a cross-reference sheet that details the ammunition lot number loaded
      in each numbered magazine.
      7.4.3.4. Return completed inventory count sheets to the MASO NLT than the MASO
      suspense date to ensure the inventory is reconciled within 30 calendar days of inventory
      freeze date. Return the completed inventory package: Inventory Count Listing
      (AM427G) signed by custodian and Custody Account Listing (AM507A), signed by
      custodian and commander to the MASO within 15 calendar days of the date submitted to
      the commander. The MASO reviews, signs, and files.
      7.4.3.4. (35FW) Munitions account custodians will ensure signed inventory listings are
      returned to the Munitions Accountability Element within 10 days of receipt. After the
      inventory listings are returned, Munitions Accountability will reconcile the inventory and
      prepare an inventory package that will be sent to the custodian Commander. Custodian
      Commanders will ensure completed inventory packages are signed and returned to
      Munitions Accountability Element within 7 days of receipt.
      7.4.3.5. Report any theft, suspected theft, loss or destruction of a munitions item (other
      than fair wear and tear, authorized expenditure, installation or disposal), to the MASO
      and Security Forces or Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI).
      7.4.3.6. Custody accounts will maintain packing material to repackage munitions
      maintained on their account. They will turn-in munitions residue, extra packaging, and
      containers to the munitions activity for certification or disposition. Those users
      authorized to certify munitions residue, as authorized by T.O. 11A-1-60, will develop
      procedures for disposal of packaging and residue, or pay for replacement packaging.
      7.4.3.7. Ensures munitions are not released to agencies or individuals outside the USAF.
      7.4.3.8. Initiate a formal courtesy storage agreement with the munitions storage activity
      when such storage is required or considered in the best interest of the Air Force.
      7.4.3.9. Ensure expenditures are validated and submitted within 5 calendar days.
  7.4.4. Custody Account Files. Custody account files are maintained electronically IAW
  paragraph 7.9.4. Custodians need not maintain separate files. As a minimum, the munitions
  account custodian will have ‗read‘ privileges to the following documents:
      7.4.4.1. Latest signed quarterly Inventory Count Listing and Custody Account Listing.
      7.4.4.2. Latest signed annual Inventory Count Listing and Custody Account Listing. If
      the annual is conducted in conjunction with the quarterly, only one document is required.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                             103


      7.4.4.3. Current fiscal year issue, expenditure, and turn-in documents for munitions
      items.
      7.4.4.4. The current approved AF Form 68 and addendum(s).
   7.4.5. Account Deficiencies. When the MASO determines that a custody account is not
   being managed or maintained properly IAW this instruction, the MASO will initiate the
   following procedures:
      7.4.5.1. Notify the organizational commander in writing and allot 15 calendar days to
      correct deficiencies.
      7.4.5.2. If discrepancies are not corrected within 15 calendar days after notification, the
      MASO must ‗freeze‘ the account and no further transactions will be processed until
      corrected.
      7.4.5.3. The MASO must ‗unfreeze‘ the account when identified discrepancies have been
      corrected or may direct assets be turned in. If discrepancies are not corrected within 30
      calendar days after notification, the group commander or equivalent will be notified
      through appropriate channels for assistance.
   7.4.6. Closure of Custody Account.
      7.4.6.1. When the Organizational Commander has deemed the custody account is no
      longer required to support training or operational missions, submit an email with
      justification for account closure to the MASO. The MASO will then direct the closure of
      the account and forward the results to the MUFM.
      7.4.6.2. Custodians will package all assets for custody turn-in using the original packing
      material. If original packing material is not available, contact the Munitions Flight for
      packing material or guidance on otherwise technically suitable packing material.
7.5. Unit Forecasting and Allocation Procedures.
   7.5.1. Forecasting: Implement forecasting and allocation procedures based on guidance
   published annually in the Peacetime Conventional Ammunitions Requirements (PCAR)
   forecast memorandum distributed by the GACP.
      7.5.1.1. Missiles and missile components will not be forecasted.
      7.5.1.2. Forecasts, allocations, and distribution activity for CAS managed explosive and
      non-explosive NWRM assets is a coordinated process between the MAJCOMs; Air Force
      Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC), 708 NSUS; and the GACP, 505 CBSS.
          7.5.1.2.1. CAS managed NWRM is forecasted by units through the MAJCOM to the
          AFNWC. CAS managed non-explosive NWRM is allocated and distributed by the
          708 NSUS . And, CAS managed explosive NWRM is allocated and distributed by
          the 505 CBSS.
          7.5.1.2.2. The 708 NSUS reviews and updates requirements and allocations annually
          and submits approved allocations to the GACP (505 CBSS) for update in AMST by
          31 July each calendar year.
   7.5.2. Determining Proper Stock Levels.
104                                                   AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


      7.5.2.1. A unit‘s allocation is that quantity of a munitions item expected to be available
      to units within the designated fiscal year. The allocation provides authorization to
      requisition and use an item for its allocated purpose.
         7.5.2.1.1. The MAJCOM/C-NAF may review, realign, or adjust unit allocations
         based on theater positioning objectives, unit requirements and storage capabilities.
         7.5.2.1.2. The MASO is responsible for notifying the custodian when their approved
         annual allocations are available in AMST.
         7.5.2.1.3. The Nuclear MASO at an installation will forecast for all non-explosive
         NWRM items. Explosive NWRM items will be forecasted for by the conventional
         MASO. In some cases, host/user command relationships may need to be established
         to differentiate between managing and using Commands. For example: Trainers
         used by an AF Global Strike Command (AFGSC) unit but managed by a MASO
         assigned to AFMC on the same base.
         7.5.2.1.4. Each base‘s portion of the Command Allocation Document is distributed to
         the MASO via CAS.
      7.5.2.2. The MASO ensures unit allocations are validated in CAS IAW the DLAR and
      MAJCOM/C-NAF instructions.
         7.5.2.2.1. Immediately after the initial fiscal year allocations are loaded by
         organizational shop code, validate proper host/user command code relationships in
         CAS. The MASO must ensure the following procedures are accomplished:
             7.5.2.2.1.1. Compare the Organizational Record Listing (AM513) to the AF
             Form 68 and AMST to verify that all ORG/SHP codes, host/user relationship
             codes, and Functional User Codes (FUC) are loaded correctly.
             7.5.2.2.1.2. Identify host/user relationship discrepancies using the GACP CRM;
             info the host/user MAJCOM.
             7.5.2.2.1.3. Validate stock levels to ensure that current fiscal year allocations are
             accurately reflected in CAS.
         7.5.2.2.2. MAJCOM/C-NAFs ensure that unit forecasts and allocations are loaded in
         AMST by ORG/SHP code and loaded against the appropriate FUC.
      7.5.2.3. Sortie Surge Training Munitions Allocations. Load levels against the ORG/SHP
      for the account but do not issue assets. Support sortie surge requirements from base stock
      assets.
      7.5.2.4. Units may be allocated munitions items in more than one CAT Code. Allocated
      assets managed on stock record account do not require physical segregation and are
      assigned the appropriate CAT Code at the point of expenditure.
      7.5.2.5. When stock levels are not sufficient to support total wing allocations, MASOs
      must coordinate with wing operational planners to determine priority of support.
      7.5.2.6. Units may maintain munitions, missiles, NWRM (e.g., Type Trainers) in excess
      of non-expendable allocations, provided the GACP/AFNWC has not tasked the unit to
      ship these assets, the unit has forecasted for the assets, or has submitted an OOCR. The
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                             105


     MASO will ensure organizations have a valid requirement prior to approval. Once
     planned movements are satisfied, the MAJCOM/C-NAF must coordinate with the
     GACP/AFNWC to redistribute these excess assets.
        7.5.2.6.1. The MASO will approve/disapprove customer requests for excess non-
        expendable assets left on custody accounts. Maintain approved requests IAW the AF
        Munitions Document Control Guide.
        7.5.2.6.2. Allocations in CAS will not be increased to support excesses.
        7.5.2.6.3. The MASO will notify customers of excess munitions requiring turn-in
        action by NSN, quantity, and CAT Code NLT 7 duty days after the allocations are
        auto loaded in CAS.
            7.5.2.6.3.1. Customers contact Munitions Inspection within 14 calendar days of
            MASO notification to schedule turn-in of excess allocations. Non-expendable
            and expendable excess must be turned in NLT 15 Nov.
            7.5.2.6.3.2. If a custody account fails to schedule turn-in of identified excess, the
            MASO must ‗freeze‘ accounts and take action according to paragraph 7.4.5.
            7.5.2.6.3.3. Excess munitions expended after MASO notification will be
            processed using inventory adjustment procedures listed in paragraph 7.11.14.
            OOCR is not an authorized solution.
               7.5.2.6.6.3.4. For non-explosive NWRM assets managed in CAS, the 708
               NSUS is the approval authority for all changes to allocations. Once approved,
               the 708 NSUS will coordinate with the 784 CBSG to change the DLAR using
               AMST.
     7.5.2.7. For GACP managed assets use the Supplemental Allocation Authorization
     Request (SAAR) system through the 784 CBSG website via the AF Portal at
     https://www.my.af.mil/ammoprod/wm/ to support stock levels for items without a
     Master Subsidiary Relationship Code (MSRC).
     7.5.2.8. CAD/PAD Time Change guidance. See paragraph 7.18 and 7.19.
  7.5.3. Out of Cycle Request (OOCR).
     7.5.3.1. Using organizations request allocation increases utilizing the OOCR process in
     AMST. Requesting units should contact their MUFM for guidance/assistance.
     7.5.3.2. OOCRs may not be submitted for allocated expendable items until at least 70-
     percent of the allocation has been expended in CAS. Units will not report future
     anticipated expenditures to satisfy the 70-percent expenditure requirement. OOCRs for
     all other items will be reviewed and considered on a case by case basis. Sufficient
     justification must accompany all requests. OOCRs for new munitions requirements (i.e.
     mission changes) will be accepted. OOCRs for OCONUS MAJCOMs will be worked on
     a case-by-case basis.
        7.5.3.2.1. Assets are allocated based on available and projected stocks and may not
        be 100-percent supportable. OOCRs for assets that were not 100-percent allocated
        may not be approved.
106                                                 AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


         7.5.3.2.2. Prior to submitting an OOCR for munitions other than aircrew training:
            7.5.3.2.2.1. The organizational commander will approve OOCR citing the
            authorizing directive, formula, and expenditure data (as applicable). This
            approval will be electronically sent to the MASO.
            7.5.3.2.2.2. The MASO will validate the OOCR to ensure all required data is
            included and reported expenditures are accurate. If valid, the MASO attempts to
            satisfy the requirements by redistributing unused allocations within the
            SRAN/DODAAC by supporting the OOCR in AMST and completing the
            allocation transfer in AMST and CAS; this is all part of the OOCR process. The
            MASO may transfer allocations among accounts within the SRAN/DODAAC to
            support valid requirements (as required), provided the ‗Using‘ Command Code is
            the same. Allocation transfers must be processed in accordance with paragraph
            7.5.3.3.
            7.5.3.2.2.3. If the MASO is unable to support the OOCR, the MASO will mark
            the appropriate block in the OOCR in AMST. The request will then automatically
            be forwarded to the next review level.
            7.5.3.2.2.4. The MASO, MUFM, MAJCOM/C-NAF munitions staff will attempt
            to transfer allocations between functional areas within their responsible areas.
            Transfers from a non-expendable to an expendable CAT Code require approval
            from Air Force Security Forces Center (AFSFC) for ground munitions, Air Force
            Civil Engineering Agency (AFCEA) for Explosive Demolition materials, and
            AF/A5RC for air-munitions and associated munitions/explosive assets.
            7.5.3.2.2.5. If an OOCR is not supportable at the local level the MUFM with
            MAJCOM/C-NAF assistance will review and either finalize, forward, or deny the
            OOCR in AMST.
            7.5.2.2.2.6. The MUFM must work closely with the MAJCOM/C-NAF
            munitions staff and GACP to ensure approved OOCRs transferring allocations do
            not cause un-programmed/unnecessary munitions movements.
            7.5.3.2.2.7. All activities (e.g., MUFM, C-NAF, Lead MAJCOM, and GACP)
            will make every effort to source, move, and consolidate movements using the
            most economical means possible.
      7.5.3.3. Allocation Transfer Requests (ATR) supporting exercises, competitions,
      demonstrations, test or training will be completed in AMST FAM.
         7.5.3.3.1. Allocation transfers for Weapons Training Deployments (WTD) are
         completed in AMST by the MASO after coordination with the MAJCOM/C-NAF
         MUFM using the following procedures:
         7.5.3.3.2. The losing MASO will ensure the unit has sufficient allocations to support
         exercise requirements and pass allocations to the supporting unit MASO not later than
         60 calendar days (CONUS) and 90 calendar days (OCONUS) before the exercise
         begins.
            7.5.3.3.2.1. The allocation transfer will list the unit, type of aircraft (if
            applicable), inclusive dates, type of munitions, NSN or CRC, Qty, and
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                              107


             CAT/Requirement Code.
             7.5.3.4.2.2. The losing/gaining MASO will ensure the allocation transfer is
             processed in CAS IAW the Munitions Accountability Procedures Guide within 14
             calendar days of the ATR date.
          7.5.3.3.3. The gaining MASO and MAJCOM/C-NAF will notify the losing MASO
          and MAJCOM/C-NAF of supportability by updating AMST no later than 7 calendar
          days after date of the ATR. Supportability will include as a minimum: NSN, NOUN,
          QTY supported/non-supported and any requisition information.
          7.5.3.3.4. The gaining MASO has requisition (stock control) responsibility for all
          increased or transferred allocations provided the time requirements in paragraph
          7.5.3.3.2 are met.
          7.5.3.3.5. After the unit completes the event (i.e., exercise, test, etc.) the host unit
          will complete the After Action Report (AAR) on the 784 CBSG web site using the
          ATR number provided during the original transfer. This report should be
          accomplished immediately, but not later than 14 calendar days after event
          completion.
          7.5.3.3.6. The losing/gaining MASO will ensure the AAR remaining allocations are
          processed in CAS IAW the Munitions Accountability Procedures Guide within 7
          calendar days of receiving the AAR.
      7.5.3.5. Every effort must be made to support the transfer timeline, however it is not the
      sole basis for determining the level of support that can be provided by the host unit. The
      primary basis for determining if munitions support can be provided must be asset
      availability, not the transfer timeline.
7.6. WRM Aircraft Munitions Levels.
   7.6.1. WRM levels are managed and continuously compared to stock balances to assure
   WRM levels remain supportable. This requires continuous MASO and munitions
   management involvement. For CAS and warehouse management this AFI takes precedence
   over AFI 25-101.
   7.6.2. WRM munitions supportability is determined by comparing on-hand balances to
   WRM allocations, actively managing and monitoring levels, and communicating constraints
   with unit commanders, MAJCOM, C-NAF, and GACP. WRM assets are not segregated
   from other base stock assets. Physical assets are categorized as WRM (or other category)
   when actually expended for that purpose.
      7.6.2.1. Assets broken out and assembled for use remain on the Stock Record Account
      until physically expended. Once expended, process the transaction in CAS against the
      appropriate ORG/SHP code and CAT Code.
      7.6.2.2. When WRM assets are stored at geographically separated locations (physically
      located at another installation but accounted for on the owning SRAN/DODAAC), a
      structure may be loaded in the owning SRAN CAS account showing the storage location
      and managed as a Stock Record Account asset. The storing location will manage the
      item as a courtesy stored asset on an unaccountable record. (This applies primarily to
      units with limited storage capability.)
108                                                AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


      7.6.2.3. Review WRM current levels on the Level Reconciliation Listing (AMC12A)
      against on- hand CAS balances to ensure WRM levels remain supportable. Note: Level
      Reconciliation Listing (AMC12A) does not identify CAT Code X levels; an ADHOC
      report must be run to show CAT Code X levels.
      7.6.2.4. Munitions managers must train personnel to manage all aspects of WRM levels.
  7.6.3. WRM levels for CAT Code G and X may be provided by the C-NAF via a WCDO.
  WRM levels for CAT Code F and T will be provided by the Lead MAJCOM/C-NAF via
  AMST.
      7.6.3.1. Load WRM air munitions levels for CAT Code G, X, and Z against ORG/SHP
      Code 002WR. Load WRM air munitions levels for CAT Code F and T against the
      appropriate squadron ORG/SHP Code as reflected in AMST. Note: Allocations loaded
      against account 002WR are positioning objectives only and do not restrict munitions
      expenditure to support valid, WRM, combat, or contingency operations.
      7.6.3.2. All munitions expended for a valid WRM, combat, or contingency purpose in
      Categories F, G, T, or X will be processed in CAS against the ORG/SHP codes identified
      below. Use these ORG/SHP codes regardless of original allocated ORG/SHP, quantity, or
      CAT Code:
      7.6.3.3. Prior to processing WRM, combat, or contingency expenditures against the
      ORG/SHP codes identified below load these ORG/SHP codes in CAS. It is not necessary
      to load levels for valid WRM, combat, or contingency expenditures. Units will use the
      ‗Level Bypass‘ option when expending against the following ORG/SHP codes:
         7.6.3.3.1. 002WR: Only process valid WRM munitions expenditures against
         ORG/SHP 002WR when no ORG/SHP code listed below is appropriate and specific
         guidance has not been provided.
         7.6.3.3.2. 003WR: MAJCOMs may authorize processing of WRM, combat, or
         contingency expenditures against ORG/SHP 003WR in support of unique MAJCOM
         operations, but will not use 003WR to process expenditures when a specific
         ORG/SHP expenditure guidance is directed.
         7.6.3.3.3. 004WR: All munitions expended for WRM, combat, or contingency
         purposes in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) will be processed against
         ORG/SHP 004WR. Exception: Process AFSOC expenditures for OIF against
         ORG/SHP 006WR (see paragraph 7.6.3.2.5.).
         7.6.3.3.4. 005WR: All munitions expended for WRM, combat, or contingency
         purpose in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) will be processed against
         ORG/SHP 005WR. Exception: Process AFSOC expenditures for OEF against
         ORG/SHP 007WR (see paragraph 7.6.3.2.6.).
         7.6.3.3.5. 006WR: Process all munitions expended for AFSOC WRM, combat, or
         contingency missions in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) against ORG/SHP
         006WR.
         7.6.3.3.6. 007WR: Process all munitions expended for AFSOC WRM, combat, or
         contingency missions in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) against
         ORG/SHP 007WR.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                              109


          7.6.3.3.7. 008WR: Process all munitions expended for AMC assigned MAF WRM,
          combat, or contingency missions in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF),
          Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) or future operations against ORG/SHP 008WR.
      7.6.3.4. At the onset of future operations AF/A4LW or GACP will issue supplementary
      guidance through command channels via official e-mail (digitally signed and encrypted)
      for processing WRM, combat, or contingency munitions expenditures using a sequential
      ORG/SHP code structure (e.g., 008WR. 009WR, etc.)
      7.6.3.5. This ORG/SHP structure for WRM, combat, or contingency expenditures for
      CAT Code F, G, T, and X enables the automated extraction and reporting of expenditure
      data by ‗Operation‘ from automated data systems (e.g., CAS, ECSS, Enterprise Data
      Warehouse (EDW), GCSS-AF Data Services, etc.).
      7.6.3.6. Munitions allocated and expended as CAT Code N for Foreign Military Sales
      (FMS), tests, training, and other operations under MOA/MOU according to paragraph
      9.6.7.2 will be expended against non-WR ORG/SHP codes created for these specific
      purposes.
   7.6.4. Munitions Supervision and MASO will brief the OG and MXG and notify the
   MAJCOM/C-NAF munitions staff when WRM assets drop below established levels. CAT
   Code T does not need to be briefed when levels drop due to operation support. The briefing
   must include:
      7.6.4.1. WRM asset posture by CR and component.
      7.6.4.2. Identify requisition due-ins and/or planned use of theater pre-positioning,
      STAMP, APF, and Fly-away assets to meet requirements.
      7.6.4.3. Limiting factors and actions taken by the MASO to resolve shortages.
7.7. Base-Level Requisitioning. The requisitioning process provides the method to obtain
required and allocated munitions and associated components.
   7.7.1. Requisitions are submitted by units to satisfy recurring and non-recurring demands
   that include Stock level objectives; DLAR and TAMP; deferred for maintenance (AWP);
   Unsatisfactory Report (UR) / Deficiency Report (DR) for CAS managed NWRM assets;
   and/or changes in authorized, allocated, available asset levels (ATR/OOCR).
   7.7.2. Units submit requisitions IAW GACP/AFNWC guidance and this instruction. Ensure
   sufficient storage space exists and technical data is available prior to requisitioning assets.
   7.7.3. The MASO and the GACP must not exceed approved stock levels (allocations) when
   requisitioning except when ordering by quantity unit pack (QUP) or quantity per shipping
   container (QSC).
   7.7.4. The MASO and the GACP must ensure the appropriate Intended Use Code (if
   applicable), Project Code and requisitioning priorities are used. Requests for expedited
   support or deviations from the existing requisitioning priorities based on operational need
   must be coordinated with the C-NAF or Lead MAJCOM prior to processing.
      7.7.4.1. Intended Use Code values can be found in CAS in the ‗Help‘ tab under ‗Field
      Elements‘.
110                                                  AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


      7.7.4.2. PACER AMMO project codes are identified in Table 7.4.
      7.7.4.3. Requisitioning priorities are established in Table 7.2. Requisition priorities for
      CAS managed NWRM assets will be ‗03‘.
      7.7.4.4. Requisition Support: Units contact the appropriate GACP Support Cell via the
      CRM located at: https://www.my.af.mil/wm/ for requisition follow-up and support.
      7.7.4.5. For CAS managed NWRM, contact the AFNWC, 708 NSUS/DD, Tel: DSN
      263-5032.
  7.7.5. Requisitions submitted to support the annual DLAR will identify the appropriate fiscal
  year for which the DLAR applies. For example, the ‗Comments‘ field will include ―FYXX
  alloc‖. Units involved in Turbo-CADS exercises will add TCXX after the FY.
  Consideration must be given to on-hand quantities, validated due-ins, current FY
  expenditures, and any ATRs or OOCRs when computing requisition quantities.
  7.7.6. MICAP requisitions (RDD 999) are not authorized, except when the lack of an item
  causes grounding of a MICAP reportable end item identified by the standard reporting
  designator (SRD) found in T.O. 00-20-2. When CAS is unavailable, units will submit
  requisitions IAW DOD 4000.25-1-M, MILSTRIP – Military Standard Requisitioning and
  Issue Procedures and GACP, C-NAF, or Lead MAJCOM guidance.
  7.7.7. Units shall monitor requisitions weekly using the CAS Requisition Status Report.
      7.7.7.1. Work with the Munitions Scheduler to reconcile outstanding requisitions for
      AWPs.
      7.7.7.2. To ensure assets are received by the required delivery date, the following actions
      will be taken:
         7.7.7.2.1. For sourced requisitions, perform monthly follow-up with the Ship from
         DODAAC. Exception: requisitions sourced to depots or SRAN: FV2172, follow-up
         will be coordinated through the appropriate GACP Support Cell via the CRM at:
         https://www/my.af.mil/wm/ no earlier than 2-weeks prior to the RDD.
         7.7.7.2.2. For requisitions in New/Pending status for more than 14 calendar days,
         contact the appropriate GACP Support Cell to validate/update status.
         7.7.7.2.3. For requisitions in Backorder status contact the appropriate GACP CRM
         IAW paragraph 1.5.1.4 after the estimated release date (ERD) has been exceeded.
         For CAD/PAD assets not available prior to required installation date, coordinate with
         P&S to submit shelf/service life extensions to applicable IM.
  AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                                                           111

       7.7.8. Do not submit requisitions for your organization's AIM requirements. Allocations are
       controlled by HQ USAF and are published in the DLAR, TAMP document, MMP, and
       AMST. These items are automatically distributed to installations by the GACP (782 CBSG)
       in coordination with the Lead MAJCOM and C-NAFs. For additional guidance see
       paragraph 3.10.
       7.7.9. When processing requisitions, the appropriate GACP Support Cell reviews projected
       requirements and expenditure rate history over the past three years. Requisitions may be
       cancelled for a variety of reasons to include requisitioning quantities that exceed authorized
 112                                                   AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


   allocation (in excess of QUP), requesting assets where no allocation exists, requesting
   quantities in excess of 99,999, and worldwide (or theater) shortage of assets that are not
   economically feasible to ship (e.g., small quantities). For example, if a unit is allocated a
   quantity of 10,000 items, has 9,990 items on-hand, and requisitions 10; however,
   expenditures or usage history does not support the request.
       7.7.9.1. Prior to cancelling or changing a requisition the reviewing/processing GACP
       Support Cell will contact the requesting unit, if additional unit specific information is
       needed to clarify the requisition. GACP will provide requisition trends and analysis on
       the GACP website to provide feedback to help communicate and resolve common
       requisition errors.
       7.7.9.2. Munitions Operations personnel will contact the appropriate GACP Support Cell
       via the CRM located at: https://www/my.af.mil/wm/ prior to denying any
       requisition/unsatisfied RDO. OCONUS units will contact their parent MAJCOM until the
       GACP OCONUS Support Cells are stood up (approximately Aug 2009).
7.8. Working Documents.
   7.8.1. General Guidance.
       7.8.1.1. Munitions personnel will not make changes to the quantity, stock, lot, or
       document number on any accountable/auditable document (including electronic). The
       authorized custodian will initial any changes to paper documents or submit a new
       electronic document prior to processing in CAS. For receipt discrepancies identified
       during in-check refer to paragraph 7.12.1.1.1, 7.12.3, and Table 7.3, Receipts, Note 7.
       7.8.1.2. Ensure all accountability documentation produced or received that is associated
       with classified items is stamped/typed/printed electronically with ―Classified Item‖ in
       red, bold, capital letters on original and all copies. This alerts personnel that the assets
       they are handling are classified, not the classification of the document.
   7.8.2. Working Document Folders. A working document folder will be created on a shared
   network drive, exchange public folder, share point, or other MAJCOM approved system to
   manage working documents. See the AF Munitions Electronic Document Administrators
   Guide on the AF/A4LW AFKN CoP. As a minimum, a main working documents folder will
   be established containing subfolders for AFV, SURV, AWAITING_MASO, and
   AWAITING_ QC Specific folders, such as AFV, will have task-specific subfolder(s) for
   ease of document management. Additional work center folders will be created for each
   element within your munitions organization (Ex.: CONV, PGM, etc.).
       7.8.2.1. Munitions personnel and customers requiring access to the working document

  7.8.5. Local Document Flow Procedures: The Munitions Flight Chief/MASO must further
  define local document flow and document control procedures in an operating instruction (OI)
  that includes:
      7.8.5.1. Responsibilities and procedures for munitions work centers to process CAS
      transactions using direct-input methods. These responsibilities will outline who
      processes a given transaction and when transactions should be processed. Procedures for
      direct-input processing will emphasize near-real time reporting requirements.
      7.8.5.1. (35FW) The following responsibilities and procedures are for munitions work
      centers to process CAS transactions and routing sequences and timelines for specific
      documents:
         7.8.5.1.1. (Added-35FW) Munitions Issues. Munitions issues will be scheduled for
         and processed on Thursdays. Issue request must meet the requirements of paragraph
         7.13.1.1. Munitions Operations (AFV) personnel will coordinate with Munitions
         Inspection and Munitions Storage to schedule the pre-issue inspection (PII).
         Munitions Inspection will call AFV when the assets are available for issue at the
         inspection building. AFV will then process the issue in the Combat Ammunition
         System (CAS) and place the electronic issue document in the Issues folder under
         Working Documents. After the custodian and inspector have electronically signed
         the issued document it is placed, or scanned if an electronic signature is not available,
         in the Awaiting QC folder under Working Documents.
         7.8.5.1.2. (Added-35FW) Munitions Turn-ins. Munitions turn-ins will be scheduled
         for and processed on Tuesdays. AFV will coordinate with Munitions Inspection and
         place the electronic turn-in request in the Turn-in folder under Working Documents.
         When the asset is turned-in, Munitions Inspection will electronically sign the turn-in
         document and move it to the Awaiting QC folder.
         7.8.5.1.3. (Added-35FW) Munitions Shipments. Upon notification of a shipment
         AFV will create a CAS generated DD Form 1348. AFV/Munitions Storage
         Shipwreck Personnel updates the shipment tracking spreadsheet. AFV then puts the
         electronic shipping document in the Inspection folder under Working Documents for
         coordination and scheduling with Munitions Storage. After the shipment is prepared
         and ready for shipment the DD Form 1348 is placed in the Awaiting Booking folder
         under Working Documents. Once the shipment has been booked by TMO it is placed
         in the Awaiting Transportation folder. When the shipment departs Misawa the
         shipment documents are immediately placed in the Awaiting QC folder.
         7.8.5.1.4. (Added-35FW) Permissions for the Working Documents folder are
         granted by the squadron information managers. Access is coordinated and granted on
         a need to know basis. Munitions Custodians have access to their documents on the
         Misawa Munitions Accountability SharePoint. Access is controlled by AFV. All
         custodians are given read access to their documents only. All other access is granted
         by request on a case-by-case basis.
         7.8.5.1.5. (Added-35FW) Document review procedures. After each of the above
         CAS transactions is completed they are placed in the Awaiting QC folder. Document
         Control personnel review the documents in the folder everyday for accuracy and

7.10. Off-Line Processing (Post-Post). Off-line processing operations are used as an interim
measure when CAS system operation is disrupted. Units will notify their MAJCOM when their
CAS systems operation has been down for 24 hours. Post-post operations allow continued
support during periods of computer downtime. The MASO is responsible for initiating post-post
procedures and recovering IAW attachment 3 and MAJCOM/C-NAF guidance.
7.11. Munitions Inventories. The MASO conducts inventories as prescribed below:
   7.11.1. Purpose. The purpose of the physical inventory control process is to validate
   accuracy of accountable records by reconciling NSN, quantity, lot number, CC, and location.
   Additionally they ensure materiel accountability is properly executed within the Department
   of Defense and Air Force IAW DODI 5000.64, Accountability and Management of DOD-
   Owned Equipment and Other Accountable Property and DOD 5100.76-M.
   7.11.2. The MASO ensures munitions users are aware of inventory dates. Publish
   semiannual inventory dates through base media. During inventories, only process emergency
   requests, submitted in writing and approved by the group commander (or equivalent). This
   minimizes transactions against the account during the inventory.
   7.11.3. Inventories will be performed and recorded utilizing either direct-input, CAS
   generated or manual inventory count sheets and the account will be frozen before the
   physical count.
   7.11.4. Inventories will be conducted and reconciled within 30 calendar days of inventory
   start (freeze) date. For semi-annual inventories, process and post all necessary records by the
   last day of the scheduled inventory month (March and September).
   7.11.5. Inventories include CR or WSN assets on stock or custody account as applicable.
   See the Munitions Accountability Procedures Guide on the AF/A4LW CoP for CR or WSN
   inventory procedures.
   7.11.6. Stock Record Account inventories include:
       7.11.6.1. Semiannual/Perpetual Inventory.
       7.11.6.2. Monthly 10-percent Inventory.
       7.11.6.3. Change of MASO Inventory.
       7.11.6.4. Depot accounts only require an annual/perpetual inventory.
   7.11.7. Custody account inventories include:
       7.11.7.1. Quarterly Custody Account Inventory. For NWRM assets, the semiannual
       stock record account inventory conducted in March and September satisfies the custody
       account inventories for those quarters.
       7.11.7.2. Annual MASO Custody Account Inventory. Exception: All NWRM assets on
       custody accounts will be inventoried by the MASO concurrently with the semiannual
       stock record account inventory.
       7.11.7.3. Monthly inventories IAW DOD 5100.76-M for missiles and rockets.
   7.11.8. In addition to the inventories listed above, a special inventory of selected items may
   be directed by the MASO or higher headquarters.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                           125


  7.11.9. Properly secured containers, including ‗LITE‘ boxes, do not need to be opened
  unless:
     7.11.9.1. Evidence of pilferage or forced entry exists.
     7.11.9.2. Quantity and other identification data on the container appear illegible.
     7.11.9.3. Assets require SN validation.
  7.11.10. Stock Record Account Inventories. Perform inventories as prescribed in attachment
  4 and below:
     7.11.10.1. Semi-annual/Perpetual Stock Record Account Inventory.             The MASO
     conducts a wall-to-wall inventory of all munitions and explosives maintained on the stock
     record account (includes unserviceable assets but excludes custody accounts and courtesy
     storage). Semi-annual inventories must be started and finished in the months of March
     and September. Outstanding AWM/AWP workorders and ADR records will be
     physically reconciled against condition tags during these inventories. CAT Code S levels
     for containers maintained on stock will be validated during the semi-annual 100-percent
     inventory. A perpetual inventory is any method that results in counting the entire
     munitions inventory three times a year. For example: Inventory 25-percent of the
     inventory monthly (25-percent per month x 12 months = 3 complete inventories). The
     perpetual inventory may be accomplished in lieu of all stock record account inventories.
         7.11.10.1.1. The MAJCOM may waive required inventory months, except for
         NWRM. Waiver authority for NWRM inventories is AFMC/A4 IAW AFI 20-110.
         7.11.10.1.2. All CAS managed NWRM assets whether on stock or custody account
         will be inventoried using semiannual inventory procedures in this AFI and IAW AFI
         20-110.
         7.11.10.1.3. Except for NWRM, munitions assets stored at collocated operating bases
         and alternate storage locations/sites may be inventoried annually.
     7.11.10.2. Monthly 10-percent Inventory. The purpose of this inventory is to identify
     negative trends between semi-annual stock record account inventories. Conduct a 10-
     percent monthly inventory of the base conventional munitions account, except during
     months when a 100-percent stock record account inventory is conducted (March and
     September). Units will develop a schedule to ensure all assets are inventoried annually as
     part of a 10-percent inventory.
         7.11.10.2.1. The 10-percent inventory may be done by NSN or by facility.
         Inventories performed by facility will be considered a 10-percent, and will be treated
         as such, even though CAS will identify them as ‗special‘. Validate AWM/AWP
         records/status for all NSNs selected for the 10-percent inventory.
         7.10.10.2.2. The monthly 10-percent inventory excludes custody accounts, courtesy
         storage, and assets stored at collocated operating bases and alternate storage
         locations/sites.
     7.11.10.3. Change of MASO Inventory. The outgoing and incoming accountable officers
     jointly review and validate results of the physical inventory of the stock record account.
126                                                  AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


      This inventory excludes custody account and courtesy stored assets. Waiver requests for
      this inventory may be approved by the MAJCOM.
      7.11.10.4. APF semi-annual, 10-percent and Change of MASO inventories are conducted
      on ISO containers that are being opened and inspected during reconstitution only. For
      ISO containers not being opened during reconstitution, verification of all seals is
      required. For APF account transfers a physical inventory is not required at the time of
      transfer.
      7.11.10.5. Stock Record Account Inventory Discrepancies:
         7.11.10.5.1. Discrepancies affecting the NSN, quantity, lot number, CC, location and
         corrective actions will be documented and briefed to the MUNS Supt/Munitions
         Flight Chief and Squadron Commander.
         7.11.10.5.2. Forward stockpile discrepancies to the Materiel and Production
         Section/Flight Chief for resolution.
         7.11.10.5.3. For contract munitions organizations, the inventory discrepancies and
         corrective actions will be documented and briefed to the QAE, Administrative
         Contracting Officer (ACO) and Functional Commander.
      7.11.10.6. The Squadron Commander will sign the inventory results briefing
      memorandum. For contract munitions organizations, this will be the ACO or Functional
      Commander.
  7.11.11. Custody Account Inventories.
      7.11.11.1. Annual MASO Custody Account Inventory. The MASO will inventory each
      custody account annually. This inventory may be in conjunction with and satisfy the
      requirements of a Quarterly Custodian Inventory.
         7.11.11.1.1. Document the results of the inventory and brief the custodian and
         commander on the findings and required corrective actions IAW paragraph 7.4.5.
         7.11.11.1.2. The organizational commander, custodian and MASO will sign copies
         of the current Custody Account Listing (AM507A) and annual inventory results
         memorandum.
         7.11.11.1.3. The MASO must include the following areas within the annual
         inventory results memorandum:
             7.11.11.1.3.1. Comply with established procedures.
             7.11.11.1.3.2. Maintain accurate custody account records.

             7.11.11.1.3.5. Adhere to safety and security criteria.
         7.11.11.1.4. The current reconciled inventory listing and findings will be maintained
         until superseded by the next annual MASO Custody Account inventory.
         7.11.11.1.5. If the MASO has difficulty conducting off-base custody account
         inventories, they will request MAJCOM waiver.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                            127


            7.11.11.1.5.1. If approved, the MASO requests the commander of the off-base
            custody account appoint disinterested individuals (at least two, one of whom must
            be a master sergeant equivalent or above) to perform the inventory.
                7.11.11.1.5.1.1. AFGSC ICBM units with munitions stored at remote launch
                facilities may appoint the ICBM Maintenance Team Chief (regardless of rank)
                and one team member to perform the inventory.
            7.11.11.1.5.2. The MASO must provide the most current custody records/listings,
            associated forms and memorandums along with instructions (including procedures
            for relieving officers of accountability and resolving discrepancies), to the off-
            base commander to ensure timely and accurate completion.
     7.11.11.2. Quarterly Custodian Inventory. The custodian conducts a physical inventory
     of all munitions issued to their custody account once every 3 months. Copies of the
     current Custody Account Inventory Listing (AM507A) will be signed by the
     organizational commander and custodian and reviewed and signed by the MASO.
         7.11.11.2.1. The current reconciled inventory will be maintained until superseded by
         the next Quarterly Custodian inventory.
         7.11.11.2.2. Discrepancies discovered during the inventory will be immediately
         brought to the attention of the MASO.
         7.11.11.2.3. AFGSC ICBM launch facility accounts are exempt from quarterly
         inventory requirements. The inventory will be performed during the annual facility
         periodic maintenance inspection of the launch facility.
     7.11.11.3. Monthly inventories. The account custodian will conduct inventories of Risk
     Category I missiles and rockets maintained outside the MSA monthly IAW DOD
     5100.76-M.
  7.11.12. Special Inventories: Conduct special inventories as directed by the MASO or higher
  headquarters.
  7.11.13. Custody Account Inventory Discrepancies.
     7.11.13.1. Discrepancies between accountable records and on-hand balances may be
     discovered during an inventory or while accomplishing day-to-day operations. In either
     case, these discrepancies must be thoroughly investigated to determine the cause.
     7.11.13.2. If the discrepancy involves only lot numbers or CCs, the Inspection element
     will verify the correct information, and an AFTO Form 102, Munitions Inspection
     Document or CAS equivalent will be used as the source document for correcting
     accountable records.
     7.11.13.3. If the discrepancy involves loss/gain of munitions or explosives, validate the
     accuracy of the latest inventory data by performing recounts of all locations as necessary.
         7.11.13.3.1. Correct known warehouse location errors.
         7.11.13.3.2. Search base stock, munitions receiving and operating, and custody
         account locations.
128                                                   AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


         7.11.13.3.3. If the missing item(s) are not located during the search, review the
         transaction history to determine if a transaction error caused the out-of-balance
         condition. Transaction histories can also be useful in suggesting alternative locations
         to search. For example:
            7.11.13.3.3.1. Validate post-post transactions that processed prior to the
            inventory or discrepancy.
            7.11.13.3.3.2. If a shipment was processed recently, you would check with the
            receiving unit to determine if they were shipped an overage.
            7.11.13.3.3.3. If a turn-in was processed recently, check to ensure assets are not
            in the inspection bay.
         7.11.13.3.4. If the shortage was caused by an erroneous transaction, RVP the
         transaction, if possible.
            7.11.13.3.4.1. If the expenditure is from a previous fiscal year, process an IAD
            IAW paragraph 7.11.14. Attach a copy of the expenditure source document as
            supporting documentation. A copy of the inventory adjustment package will be
            submitted to MAJCOM who will forward to the appropriate Air Staff PM to
            manually capture the expenditure data.
         7.11.13.3.5. If the transaction cannot be processed as a RVP, process an IAD
         according to paragraph 7.11.14 and attach the transaction history and a copy of the
         erroneous document as supporting documentation.
         7.11.13.3.6. If the assets are not located during the search, and the loss is not a result
         of an erroneous transaction, the responsible commander or a designated
         representative must determine if the loss meets the reporting criteria outlined in DOD
         5100.76-M. If assets meet these criteria, submit the required documentation IAW
         AFI 31-101.
  7.11.14. Inventory Adjustment Procedures.            When stockpile or custody account
  discrepancies exist that could not be reconciled, the following procedures will be used:
      7.11.14.1. The Munitions Operations element chief notifies the MASO of the
      discrepancy and pending Inventory Adjustment package.
      7.11.14.2. The Munitions Operations section prepares the Inventory Adjustment
      package. The final Inventory Adjustment package will be electronically filed IAW the
      AF ERM Solution Guide. The package will include a memorandum endorsed by the
      MASO and Munitions Supervision which includes the following:
         7.11.14.2.1. Circumstances of the loss/overage. (i.e., Asset(s) description, quantities,
         dollar values, when, and how item(s) were discovered missing, etc.)
         7.11.14.2.2. Chronological events and actions taken to locate the assets or determine
         the source of the overage.
         7.11.14.2.3. A clear statement identifying that an inventory was performed, research
         was conducted, description of evidence showing that theft, fraud, or waste does/does
         not appear to exist, and describes the intended corrective actions to prevent
         recurrence. These are mandatory elements of the IAD package.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                       129


        7.11.14.2.4. Supporting documentation. For inventory adjustments created as a
        result of processing the correct location of an asset during an inventory, the only
        supporting documentation required is a copy of the corresponding count sheet. The
        MASO appointing authority is not required to sign location correction inventory
        adjustments. All inventory adjustment/ Manual Record Processing (AMC05A)
        packages must contain as a minimum:
           7.11.14.2.4.1. The applicable transaction history record.
           7.11.14.2.4.2. Inventory count sheets (for all types of inventories).
           7.11.14.2.4.3. MASO (stock) or commander (custody) memo of explanation
           including corrective actions taken to prevent recurrence.
           7.11.14.2.4.4. Commander‘s memo approving/denying relief of accountability for
           custodial account losses.
           7.11.14.2.4.5. Attach all supporting documentation to the memo.
           7.11.14.2.4.6. The following documents (if applicable to the inventory
           adjustment) will be included as part of the inventory adjustment/ Manual Record
           Processing (AMC05A) package:
               7.11.14.2.4.6.1. DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property
               Loss.
               7.11.14.2.4.6.2. AFTO Form 102, Munitions Inspection Document (or signed
               CAS document).
               7.11.14.2.4.6.3. DD Form 114, Military Pay Order.
               7.11.14.2.4.6.4. DD Form 362, Statement of Charges/Cash Collection
               Voucher.
               7.11.14.2.4.6.5. DD Form 1131, Cash Collect Voucher.
               7.11.14.2.4.6.6. DD Form 361, Transportation Discrepancy Report (TDR)
               (Previously, SF Form 361).
               7.11.14.2.4.6.7. SF 364, Report of Discrepancy (ROD).
               7.11.14.2.4.6.8. A discrepancy investigation statement with copies of
               erroneous documents which could not be processed as an RVP.
               7.11.14.2.4.6.9. CAS DIREP when adjustments result from a computer
               discrepancy.
               7.11.14.2.4.6.10. Aircraft mishap report or a memorandum signed by the OG
               or MXG commander as authority for relief.
     7.11.14.3. Munitions Operations personnel brief the MASO and the MASO reviews the
     IAD package for sufficiency to justify the IAD to the appointing official.
     7.11.14.4. Once the MASO concurs with the IAD package, the MASO submits the
     package to the MUNS Supt/Flight Chief/Commander.
130                                                   AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


      7.11.14.5. The MUNS Supt/Flight Chief/Commander review the IAD package for causes
      and evaluates whether flight processes or polices require revision (e.g., ROS should be
      submitted, inspection program is sound, inventory procedures are adequate, and whether
      package stands-alone). After any identified concerns/issues are resolved, the MUNS
      Supt/Flight Chief initials the IAD package.
      7.11.14.6. The IAD package is forwarded back to the MASO who routes the package to
      obtain final approval and signatures as required before processing any inventory
      adjustment.
      7.11.14.7. If the certifying official is not satisfied with the research accomplished or the
      actions taken, they should return the document to the initiator with instructions to
      perform additional research or initiate a DD Form 200 if additional research does not
      satisfactorily explain the discrepancy.
      7.11.14.8. Prior to processing any IAD, obtain approval in writing from the certifying
      and approving officials. This signed approval will be attached to the IAD.
      7.11.14.9. Inventory adjustments that require a ROS for relief of accountability will be
      certified by the MASO and approved by the MASO appointing authority.
         7.11.14.9.1. IADs, which do not require an ROS, will be certified by the NCOIC of
         Munitions Operations or equivalent and approved by the MASO. The MASO may
         not delegate authority to approve inventory adjustments. If the MASO is not
         available, the MASO appointing authority will approve adjustments.
         7.11.14.9.2. When individuals certify or approve IADs, they are indicating:
             7.11.14.9.2.1. Awareness of the discrepancies reflected in the IAD.
             7.11.14.9.2.2. Approval of actions taken to resolve the discrepancy and prevent
             recurrence.
      7.11.14.10. Assets adjusted from accountable records which are later recovered, but have
      a zero balance in base stock, will be picked up on record using ORG TIN procedures
      IAW paragraph 7.16.1.1. In this case, mandatory documents outlined in paragraph
      7.11.14.2.4 must be completed and an inventory adjustment package consisting of the
      Turn-in and all additional required documents must be kept on file.
      7.11.14.11. If a discrepancy involves finding more assets on stock than are on
      accountable records, thorough research must be done to determine the source of the
      excess items, to include inventorying custody accounts with like items on record. Any
      additional supporting documentation will be attached to the original IAD package.
      7.11.14.12. If a discrepancy item meets Found on Base (FOB) turn-in criteria listed in
      paragraph 7.16.1.5 use an FOB turn-in to pick them up on accountable records.
      7.11.14.13. If discrepancy items do not meet criteria of either of the criteria above
      process an inventory adjustment document to place items on record. Inventory
      adjustments to place items on record must be supported and processed in the same
      manner as described above to adjust assets off of accountable record.
  7.11.15. Reports of Survey (ROS) Procedures.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                           131


     7.11.15.1. Regardless of whether or not a loss meets ROS criteria, an ROS must be
     completed if negligence, willful misconduct or deliberate unauthorized use of munitions
     is suspected or when the loss involves the following CIICs:
        7.11.15.1.1. Category 1 - Very high risk.
        7.11.15.1.2. Category 2 - High risk.
        7.11.15.1.3. CIIC C (confidential), 6 or 8.
        7.11.15.1.4. CIIC S (secret) or 5.
        7.11.15.1.5. CIIC T - Top Secret.
     7.11.15.2. In addition to the mandatory criteria above, you must submit a ROS for all
     adjustments to balances of Stock Record account and Custody account assets unless the
     adjustment(s) meet one the following conditions:
        7.11.15.2.1. Stock Record Account assets: One-time loss of less than 200 items
        valued at $1,000 or less total.
        7.11.15.2.2. Custody Account: One-time loss of Category 3 (moderate risk)
        munitions of 20 or fewer items whose total- value is $200 or less.
        7.11.15.2.3. Custody Account: One-time loss of a Category 4 and 7 (low risk) or U
        (unclassified) munitions of 200 or fewer items whose total value is $250 or less.
     7.11.15.3. As used in the instances above, ‗one-time‘ loss means each incident will be
     treated (reported and resolved) individually. In other words, you cannot group months or
     weeks‘ worth of losses and justify them under a single document. On the other hand,
     ‗one-time loss‘ does not mean that you will automatically initiate a ROS the second time
     an account loses munitions. Commanders and munitions managers must evaluate each
     incident/loss within the overall context of asset accountability.          A pattern of
     irresponsibility or lack of adequate inventory controls is grounds for either freezing the
     custody account or initiating a ROS.
     7.11.15.4. The organizational commander of the account may allow the responsible
     individual to pay for the loss in lieu of a ROS, IAW AFMAN- 23-220, or may sign a
     memorandum stating that payment is not required. If the commander chooses one of
     these options, they will provide the MASO with a copy of the memorandum or one of the
     forms listed in paragraph 7.11.14.2.4 to support the inventory adjustment.
     7.11.15.5. The cost of processing an ROS for small dollar losses may exceed any amount
     recovered. However, because of the sensitivity of munitions items, emphasis is placed on
     accountability rather than economy or efficiency.
     7.11.15.6. Do not submit a ROS for losses resulting from aircraft accidents and property
     lost during combat operations. Use the aircraft mishap report or a memorandum signed
     by the OG or MXG commander as authority for inventory adjustment. A copy of the
     report or memorandum will be filed with the inventory adjustment document.
     Commanders may elect to process a ROS regardless of criteria.
     7.11.15.7. See AFMAN 23-220 for ROS processing format, procedures, timelines, and
     approval levels.
 132                                                  AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


       7.11.15.8. Use the ROS to substantiate adjustment of the stock record account, to
       recommend corrective action and to determine the financial responsibility of the
       accountable officer or any other person involved in the discrepancy.
          7.11.15.8.1. Once an ROS number has been assigned and written approval has been
          received from the certifying official (MASO) and approving official (MASO
          Appointment Authority), the inventory adjustment may be processed. After the
          inventory adjustment is processed, the inventory may be ‗reconciled‘ and closed out
          in CAS.
          7.11.15.8.2. Once processed in CAS, the IAD and inventory is ‗closed‘, however, the
          ROS and Inventory Adjustment package remain open pending 'final' approval of the
          ROS.
       7.11.15.9. Whether or not an ROS is required, the inventory adjustment records must
       clearly identify and include all information relating to the stockpile discrepancy and
       support the adjustment as a ‗stand alone‘ package. This package will complete the audit
       trail through documents identified in paragraph 7.11.14.2.4 to support the inventory
       adjustment.
       7.11.15.10. The criteria and actions described above for ROS and inventory adjustments
       also apply to munitions assigned to a stock record or custody account which are damaged
       or destroyed for reasons other than fair wear and tear, authorized expenditure, aircraft
       loss, installation, or disposition. In these cases, the accountable officer or the account
       custodian is liable for the damage or destruction until relieved of accountability.
7.12. Receiving Munitions.
   7.12.1. Verifying Documentation. Personnel authorized to receipt for munitions will in-
   check assets. In-checking consists of comparing shipping documents with outer container
   markings (identity & quantity).
   7.12.1. 1 When the received quantity, lot number or NSN is different from the shipping
   document, the in-checker will circle the erroneous information on the document, enter correct
   information and initial. Initiate research to resolve any discrepancy noted during the in-
   checking of munitions assets. Follow procedures in paragraph 7.12.3.
       7.12.1.2. Incoming ammunition shipments of nonstandard items received without
       sufficient documentation constitute a potential safety hazard to both facilities and
       personnel. Notify the MUNS Supt/Munitions Flight Chief prior to accepting these assets.
       7.12.1.3. All CAS managed NWRM assets will be received/picked up on CAS records.
       In addition, ensure that AFI 20-110 is followed for additional NWRM receiving
       requirements.
   7.12.2. Receipt Discrepancies.  Munitions received without sufficient accountability
   documentation, including COTS munitions, are processed as follows:
       7.12.2.1. Contact the shipping activity and request information/documentation is
       provided immediately.
       7.12.2.2. After all information is validated, prepare an off-line shipping document, DD
       Form 1348-1A, and process the receipt. Stamp/annotate the DD Form 1348-1A,
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                           133


      ―Shipping documentation not received‖.      COTS documents will be stamped ―COTS
      Munitions Documents Not Required.‖
      7.12.2.3. Prepare and distribute SF 364 as prescribed in AFJMAN 23-215 to the
      applicable organization email account according to the following:
          7.12.2.3.1. For a shipping (Item) discrepancy e-mail a copy to the shipping activity
          (basename.FVXXXX@basename.af.mil), the responsible ALC or ICP (Attn:
          appropriate IM obtained from the CAS IDR), the MAJCOM/A4W or equivalent (both
          if shipper‘s is different than receiving unit‘s), and the local MASO.
          7.12.2.3.2. For packaging discrepancies, send a copy to the shipping activity, the
          GACP and packaging specialist IAW AFJMAN 23-215, Enclosure 3J.2., and the C-
          NAF or Lead MAJCOM (both if different than receiving unit).
      7.12.2.4. Use the DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document or DD
      Form 250 in place of the DD Form 1348 for munitions/missile shipments from contract
      facilities is acceptable. Units are not required to recreate shipping documents.
   7.12.3. Receipt Procedures. Assets are in-checked and receiving inspections (RI) performed
   IAW T.O. 11A-1-10. In combat situations, receiving inspections may be conducted as part
   of the assembly/ production process. Non-explosive NWRM receiving inspections are IAW
   applicable technical data.
      7.12.3.1. All Category I and II AA&E, and classified AA&E shipments will be checked
      immediately upon receipt to ensure that the seals are intact and for any signs of damage
      or tampering. If there are any signs of damage or tampering there must be an immediate
      inventory to verify quantities received and to determine extent of any damage or
      tampering.
      7.12.3.2. Process receipt details in CAS Receipts (AMI41A) or with use of CAS AIT
      Receipt menu.
7.13. Issues. Munitions items will not be issued until all documentation has been properly
processed.
   7.13.1. General Issue Procedures.
      7.13.1.1. Issue requests shall be submitted electronically to the munitions organization.
      The MASO may authorize verbal or written requests.

      7.13.1.2. Munitions will be issued in QUP or ‗LITE box‘ configuration when possible, to
      limit creation of ‗non-standard‘ packaging not within special packaging
      instructions/transportation packaging order (SPI/TPO) configuration, which creates a
      possible hazard class conflict as described in T.O. 11A-1-10.
      7.13.1.3. All issue requests will include the following:
         7.13.1.3.1. ORG/Shop code
         7.13.1.3.2. Nomenclature
         7.13.1.3.3. NSN
         7.13.1.3.4. Quantity
         7.13.1.3.5. CAT Code
         7.13.1.3.6. The words "CLASSIFIED ITEM" if applicable.
         7.13.1.3.7. Date and time required
         7.13.1.3.8. Issue type.
         7.13.1.3.9. In addition, consumption issues for aircraft time change items include the
         grounding date.
      7.13.1.4. Munitions Pick-up Procedures.
         7.13.1.4.1. Customers receiving property must present a valid CAC or other DOD
         identification card. Only personnel listed on the AF Form 68 are authorized to receipt
         for assets.
         7.13.1.4.2. After validation that an individual is an authorized representative of the
         commander, the property will be signed for and released.
         7.13.1.4.3. The receiving individual will verify property received by checking the
         NSN, lot number, CC and quantity before signing for property.
         7.13.1.4.4. If changes have occurred to documents (quantity, lot number, etc.), the
         document shall not be signed and the recipient will notify Munitions Operations
         immediately.
         7.13.1.4.5. Responsibility for safety, security and accountability for munitions from
         the time of issue remains with the using organization. This includes lot number
         integrity.
         7.13.1.4.6. (Added-35FW) Munitions Inspection Element will notify the custodian
         when assets are ready for pick up. Consumption issues will be ready for pickup by
         1100 hours on Thursdays and custodians must sign for assets NLT 1400 hours. In the
         event a custodian cannot make the deadline, notify the Munitions Inspection Element
         scheduler.
      7.13.1.5. Organizational Refusals. Organizations refusing a previously requested issue
      of assets, must complete and provide proper Turn-In documentation for the refusal IAW
      paragraph 7.16. The refusing organization will sign the issue document and annotate
      ―ORGANIZATIONAL REFUSAL" on the face of the document and provide a brief
      description of the circumstances surrounding the refusal. Organizational refusals may be
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                              135


     processes electronically via e-mail, etc. MASO‘s should notify commanders when their
     organizations have excessive refusals within a one year period.
  7.13.2. There are two types of issues:
     7.13.2.1. Consumption Issue.
         7.13.2.1.1. Consumption issues are limited to those assets consumed or installed
         within 15 calendar days (i.e., DIFM, Time Change, Shop Stock, and R&D). Shop
         stock issues and research and development (R&D) activities are not bound by the 15
         calendar day rule.
         7.13.2.1.2. Limit consumption issues to the amount to be consumed on the day of
         issue if storage, security or safety requirements cannot be satisfied.
         7.13.2.1.3. Stockpile Consumption Issues: Theses issues are processed from
         stockpile to remove assets off of base stock record for use (e.g., replace AUR
         components, stuff containers, etc). Process these issues against ORG/SHP 002SM.
         These documents will be signed by munitions personnel authorized to receipt for
         munitions assets. No AF Form 68 is required.
         7.13.2.1.4. DIFM. Unless otherwise stated, all ERRC code ‗XD‘ will be controlled
         using DIFM. These assets are of high value and/or field/depot repairable and
         reusable. Use CAS DIFM listing (AM535A) to monitor DIFM assets to ensure they
         are returned within 15 calendar days. The 15 calendar day count starts from the date
         assets were physically received by the customer.
             7.13.2.1.4.1. For initial issue requests use DIFM bypass Indicator.
             7.13.2.1.4.2. All replacement AFE munitions requirements, regardless of ERRC,
             will be consumption issued using DIFM procedures.
         7.13.2.1.5. Units may manage CAT Code D and CAT Code E consumable assets as a
         part of the CRC directly from base stock or build a local CRC that excludes arming
         wire, swivel and links, ferrules, safety clips, and lugs.
             7.13.2.1.5.1. The MASO in collaboration with other munitions managers may
             utilize stock storage locations within the maintenance and production facilities
             (e.g., build pads, maintenance bays, line-delivery, etc.) as necessary to enable
             stock management of these consumable assets. The MASO develops local
             procedures to strictly control these parts in production facilities as a component of
             the CRC. The use of direct input is encouraged to manage and expend these
             assets as individual parts or as part of the CRC.
             7.13.2.1.5.2. If the MASO determines that management of these consumables
             parts from stock is not possible, the MASO may authorize consumption issue.
                 7.13.2.1.5.2.1. Build a local CRC that excludes the parts (e.g., arming wire,
                 swivel and links, ferrules, safety clips, lugs) and consumption issue the parts
                 to a local training account in support of test and/or training; adjust levels
                 accordingly. If local CRCs are used, the consumable parts must be controlled
                 as shop stock. Consumption issues will be used in support of the following
                 accounts:
136                                                   AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


                  7.13.2.1.5.2.1.1. External Training (i.e., Load Barn).
                  7.13.2.1.5.2.1.2. Internal Training (e.g., CMT, Sortie Surge).
                  7.13.2.1.5.2.1.3. RT&D.
                 7.13.2.1.5.2.2. The MASO may consumption issue an entire QUP of shop
                 stock type items regardless of allocation quantity, (e.g., if an allocation of
                 1,136 feet remains for arming wire, an entire roll of 5K feet is authorized for
                 issue). Increase the remaining allocation Asset Level Stratification (AMG04)
                 to allow the issue of the asset, then reset the remaining allocation to zero. Use
                 of this procedure is authorized only once per fiscal year. Additional allocation
                 quantities must be justified with an OOCR.
                 7.13.2.1.5.2.3. If unused pieces and parts remain from a consumption issue
                 and the parts are no longer required, process a TIN IAW paragraph 7.6.1.3 to
                 inspect and return parts to stock.
         7.13.2.1.6. Units will ensure enough assets remain available on stock in CAS to
         support CR builds and expenditures.
         7.13.2.1.7. Use the consumption issue process for items that require disposal of
         explosive munitions by EOD. Make consumption issues to a default EOD ORG/SHP
         account 920RW under CAT Code Y only. (See 3.11.10.3.2)
             7.13.2.1.7.1. Units do not generate an AF Form 68 for ORG/SHP 920RW.
             7.13.2.1.7.2. Use the MASO correspondence memorandum, ‗Personnel
             Authorized to Dispose of Munitions‘ provided by EOD to validate personnel
             authorized to sign and date the CAS generated document.
      7.13.2.2. Custody Issue. A custody issue is used to supply an organization with
      munitions for the current Fiscal Year period. Secure facilities and adequate storage must
      be available for all custody issues as outlined in AFI 31-101 and AFMAN 91-201.
      7.13.2.3. Emergency Issue. An emergency issue is an unforeseen consumption or
      custody issue requirement that may prevent a unit from performing its mission unless the
      munitions item can be issued and installed/consumed within 12 hours of issue.
         7.13.2.3.1. MUNS Supt/Munitions Flight Chiefs determine supportability. If
         Munitions supervision determines the request is supportable no emergency issue
         approval is required.
         7.13.2.3.2. In cases of competing priorities (e.g., semi-annual inventories) emergency
         requests must be justified and approved, in writing, by the MXG commander or
         designated representative. The approval must accompany the issue request.
         Designated representatives must be appointed in writing and will not be lower than a
         unit commander.
         7.13.2.3.3. (Added-35FW) Units submitting an Emergency Issue/Supplemental
         Request Letter (Attachment 9) must have the issue justified and approved in writing
         by the MXG commander           or designated representative.      The Emergency
         Issue/Supplemental Request Letter must state the nature of emergency, negative
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                               137


          mission impact if the issue request is not supported, and latest date munitions may be
          issued to prevent mission impact.
7.14. Shipments.
   7.14.1. The Global Transportation Network (GTN).
      7.14.1.1. GTN provides in-transit visibility of munitions movements through the Cargo
      Movement Operation System (CMOS). An interface exists between CAS and CMOS (or
      GTN) however not all interfaces are functional (or may be disabled), therefore, at a
      minimum the MASO will ensure appropriate personnel maintain a GTN account to track
      shipments.
      7.14.1.2. To obtain GTN account, go to the GTN homepage at
      http://wwwgtn.safb.af.mil/. In the event you do not have Internet capabilities, establish
      a local policy with your servicing transportation unit to provide access to the data to track
      shipment status.
      7.14.1.3. CAS managed NWRM assets will be shipped in CAS.                  Ensure that any
      additional shipping guidance provided in AFI 20-110 is followed.
   7.14.2. Processing Shipments.
      7.14.2.1. The transportation office must provide the MASO with a list of individuals
      authorized to receipt for munitions and explosive items, including classified items to be
      released to the transportation movement officer for shipment. For organic movements,
      the gaining MASO must provide a list of authorized personnel to the losing MASO for
      receipt of munitions.
          7.14.2.1.1. The lists must contain name, rank, security clearance, and signature
          specimen for each authorized individual. Update the list as changes occur and re-
          accomplish annually.
             7.14.2.1.1.1. The authorization list is required regardless of digital signature
             capability, however if the local transportation office has the capability to digitally
             sign and receipt for munitions and explosive items being shipped, then no
             signature specimen is required on the list.
             7.14.2.1.1.2. In the event digital signature capability is lost or post-post and
             manual procedures are implemented, obtain signature specimens and actual
             signatures for all munitions/explosive shipments.
          7.14.2.1.2. Do not release munitions items to transportation unless the individual
          appears on current listing.
          7.14.2.1.3. Transportation personnel need not sign a shipping document unless it is
          processed through the transportation activity (For example: Munitions moved by
          munitions personnel from base-A to base-B).
      7.14.2.2. When assets require shipment for return and repair, use instructions issued by
      the IM or System Program Office (SPO) as direction and guidance for the shipment.
      7.14.2.3. Shipping units will notify the destination unit of any delays in processing the
      shipment to meet the RDD. Include the justification and projected delivery date. If the
138                                                  AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


      gaining unit needs the RDO before the projected delivery date, they will send a priority
      change request to C-NAF or Lead MAJCOM.
      7.14.2.4. When tasked to ship MICAP and priority 02 shipments, turn the documentation
      over to transportation within 24 hours.
      7.14.2.5. Units will review the Unsatisfied RDO Listing (AM124A) daily. This listing
      serves as authority to ship assets. Units unable to support requests, contact the GACP
      and get approval to deny the RDO. Once the GACP approves the denial, the unit will
      process an RDO denial in the RDO Shipment (AM123A) program.
      7.14.2.6. Once the property is released to or scheduled with the servicing transportation
      unit, update the CAS in-transit record indicating date sent to transportation and estimated
      ship date. Update the Date Departed Origin (DDO) via the Manage Intransits (AMI07A)
      or the Inquire and Update Outbounds (AMI08A) screens when shipments physically
      depart station.
  7.14.3. Accounting for Munitions In-Transit:
      7.14.3.1. Munitions activities shall retain accountability of munitions assets placed in an
      intransit status until the actual Date Departed Origin (DDO).
      7.14.3.2. When the shipping Munitions activity selects assets for shipment they are
      loaded to the CAS Intransit Asset Table. When the shipping Munitions activity updates
      the DDO in CAS, the local SRAN, location and structure are removed from the assets.
      7.14.3.3. Ensure all intransit shipments temporarily stored within the MSA that did not
      originate from that base SRAN are loaded and managed in CAS using the Non-
      Accountable (AM101A) program. Also, manage shipments erroneously DDO‘d or
      shipments dropped off of record using AM101A. When these shipment actually depart
      the installation, clear these assets from the Non-accountable program (AM101A). These
      intransit will be validated during the weekly shipment reconciliation.
      7.14.3.4. When CAS is not available at the shipping or receiving installation, the MASO
      must keep the servicing MAJCOM/C-NAF and the GACP apprised of the shipment status
      via any expedient and accurate means (e.g., official e-mail (digitally signed and
      encrypted), fax, etc.)
      7.14.3.5. Shipments between Air Force activities:
         7.14.3.5.1. Munitions shipped from one Air Force FV SRAN to another FV SRAN
         will remain in the CAS Intransit Asset Table until received by the destination activity.
         Refer to paragraph 7.14.3.7 for all classified and sensitive munitions shipments
         regardless of origin or destination.
         7.14.3.5.2. Reconcile and document status of all outstanding shipments, by TCN,
         with the transportation activity and intended destination activity weekly.
         7.14.3.5.3. Verify the DDO in CAS once assets physically depart installation. For
         assets not updated by CMOS, process the DDO action manually in CAS. Note: At
         installations with aerial ports, the CMOS – CAS interface may have been disabled
         due to erroneous DDO feeds from CMOS. In these cases, the DDO must be updated
         manually.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                          139


        7.14.3.5.4. When assets are received in CAS by the destination Munitions activity,
        the assets will automatically drop off the CAS Intransit Asset Table and be picked up
        on the receiving FV SRAN account record.
        7.14.3.5.5. Munitions activities are responsible to actively follow-up by reviewing
        and monitoring the CAS Intransit Assets. If problems are suspected or noted, unit
        shippers and receivers will initiate communications (e.g., telephone, e-mail, CRM as
        appropriate) with the origin/destination, C-NAF, Lead MAJCOM, or GACP as
        appropriate to identify and resolve problems.
        7.14.3.5.6. In the event the recipient does not receive the material by the RDD,
        follow-up through the transportation activity/unit if the DDO is not greater than 30
        days. If DDO is greater than 30 days, tracer action must be initiated with
        transportation unit using the TCN. Follow-up timelines for Classified and Sensitive
        munitions are IAW paragraph 7.14.3.7.
     7.14.3.6. Shipments to Non-Air Force Activities: Munitions shipment records to/from
     non-Air Force activities (e.g., retail/wholesale depots, manufacturer/ contract repair
     facilities, other services/federal agencies) will automatically ‗clear‘ from the CAS
     Intransit Asset Table 30 days after the DDO is updated in CAS. Note: Intransit records
     for classified and sensitive munitions categories identified in paragraph 7.14.3.7 do not
     automatically clear. These records are cleared by the GACP.
     7.14.3.7. Classified and Sensitive Munitions Shipments: The loss, theft, unlawful
     disposition, and/or recovery of Classified and Sensitive munitions require investigation
     IAW DOD 4000.25-2-M, Military Standard Transaction Reporting and Accounting
     Procedures (MILSTRAP). Therefore, a higher level of oversight is necessary to validate
     that munitions shipments involving classified and sensitive assets between Air Force
     installations and non-Air Force facilities were actually received at the intended
     destination before clearing intransit records from the CAS Intransit Asset Table.
        7.14.3.7.1. Receipt validation applies to the following Classified and Sensitive Item
        categories:
            7.14.3.7.1.1. CIIC 1 – Very High Risk (Category I)
            7.14.3.7.1.2. CIIC 2 – High Risk (Category II)
            7.14.3.7.1.3. CIIC 5 – Secret (Category I)
            7.14.3.7.1.4. CIIC 6 – Confidential (Category I)
            7.14.3.7.1.5. CIIC 8 – Confidential (Category II)
            7.14.3.7.1.6. CIIC C – Confidential
            7.14.3.7.1.7. CIIC S – Secret
            7.14.3.7.1.8. CIIC T– Top Secret
        7.14.3.7.2. There are two methods to accomplish receipt validation depending on the
        origin/destination of the shipment. 1) Receipt at an AF SRAN using the original CAS
        TCN or 2) GACP centrally validates shipment receipt and notifies the CAS PMO to
        clear the CAS Intransit record.
140                                           AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


      7.14.3.7.2.1. Shipments between Air Force SRANs: MASOs at AF installations
      receiving classified or sensitive munitions from other AF installations will receipt
      assets in CAS following normal receipt procedures which will clear intransit
      records from the CAS Intransit Asset Table.
         7.14.3.7.2.1.1. Ensure all classified and sensitive munitions assets are
         receipted properly using the CAS TCN. Receipt in CAS constitutes propoer
         ‗validation‘ only when the receipt is processed using the CAS TCN and it the
         shipment is cleared from the CAS Intransit Asset Table. Personnel receiving
         these classified and sensitive assets are responsible to the MASO to validate
         the shipment was cleared from the CAS Intransit Asset Table.
         7.14.3.7.2.1.2. If the CAS TCN cannot be used or the CAS Intransit Asset
         Table did not properly clear the shipment, receive these assets using a local
         TCN, and immediately notify the GACP through the CRM and report the
         following information:
           7.14.3.7.2.1.2.1. Reason CAS TCN could not be used.
           7.14.3.7.2.1.2.2. Original CAS TCN (if any).
           7.14.3.7.2.1.2.3. Local TCN used to receipt assets.
           7.14.3.7.2.1.2.4. NSN.
           7.14.3.7.2.1.2.5. Quantity.
           7.14.3.7.2.1.2.6. Full Name, Organization, and DSN of personnel
           processing receipt in CAS.
         7.14.3.7.2.1.3. Once this data is received, the GACP will submit shipment
         receipt information to the CAS PMO to clear the intransit record. The GACP
         will file these CRM transaction notifications and the CAS PMO requests
         electronically IAW the AF RDS in AFRIMS.
      7.14.3.7.2.2. Shipments to/from Non-Air Force Activities: The GACP will
      centrally manage, oversee, research as necessary, and after receipt validation
      submit notifications to the CAS PMO to clear CAS Intransit Asset Table records
      for these shipments. The GACP will develop internal processes/ procedures to
      validate these shipments and notify the CAS PMO.
         7.14.3.7.2.2.1. GACP validation of classified and sensitive munitions
         shipments requires that each receiver acknowledge verbally, in writing, via e-
         mail (digital signature), or through other automated means (CAS, other
         application) that the shipped TCN, NSN, and quantity was actually received,
         and the date assets were received.
         7.14.3.7.2.2.2. Validation will be performed on all classified and sensitive
         shipments that exceed the Estimated Delivery Date (EDD) or go beyond 30-
         days from the DDO.
         7.14.3.4.2.2.3. The CAS PMO is not responsible to validate shipment
         receipts. The CAS PMO will promptly clear specified CAS Intransit Asset
         Table records upon notification by the GACP.

  7.14.4. Assign PACER AMMO project code IAW Table 7.4.
     7.14.4.1. PACER AMMO is the USAF program to monitor and track worldwide
     munitions transportation costs using HQ AFMC managed SDT funds IAW paragraph
     15.6.
     7.14.4.2. The program has two categories; ‗Must Pays‘ and ‗Prioritized‘ based on the
     MMP developed by the GAP Working Group. The categories are further broken down
     by project code IAW Table 7.4. PACER AMMO budgets for SDT funds to cover the
     ‗Must Pay‘ category which must not be exceeded. The program does not include the
     shipment of munitions in support of warfighter contingency operations (including ANG)
     identified by a 9XX project code. All peacetime munitions shipments must be assigned a
     project code IAW Table 7.4.
  7.14.5. Transportation assigns one of the following Transportation Account Codes (TAC):
     7.14.5.1. F8RT. Used for movement of missiles governed by the TAMP.
     7.14.5.2. F8UT. Used for movement of conventional munitions and precision guided
     munitions not covered by the TAMP.
     7.14.5.3. Air National Guard Shipment: For conventional munitions shipments to, from,
     and between ANG units refer to AFI 24-203.
         7.14.5.3.1. Munitions shipments directed by the ANG are not a part of the PACER
         AMMO Program and will be funded by ANG units using local O&M funds or other
         ANG TAC directed by NGB/A4RDT.
         7.14.5.3.2. When assets are moving in the CONUS, contact the receiving ANG base
         for a local O&M fund cite when:
         7.14.5.3.3. When assets are moving to OCONUS ANG bases, use the ANG TAC
         F8E0.
  7.14.6. ISO Container shipments:
     7.14.6.1. Shipping documents will be produced for each container to be shipped.
     7.14.6.2. Prior-to-use inspections will be performed before loading munitions for
     shipment and will consist of a visual interior and exterior examination for obvious
     defects.
     7.14.6.3. Documentation of this inspection will be acknowledged by signing the DD
     Form 1348-1A ‗Inspected By‘ and completing the ‗Date‘ blocks.
     7.14.6.4. Shipping documents will be processed in CAS and saved electronically IAW
     paragraph 7.14. Visibility of Intransit ISO containers will be maintained by the MASO
     or other designated ‗Ship-To‘ SRAN according to paragraph 7.14.2.
         7.14.6.4.1. Shipments of munitions using ISO containers that originate from
         munitions activities will attach CAS shipping documents and the Mass Shipment
         Report (AMI25R) to the inside of a door on each container. Attach the original-
         signed DA Form 2404 to the inside of a door on each container and maintain a copy
         of the DA Form 2404 for one year from date of shipment.
142                                                  AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


         7.14.6.4.2. ISO container shipments from an APF SRAN that transit a port do not
         require a hard-copy CAS shipping document on or inside the container. The
         electronic document serves as the primary shipping document and may be the only
         document available to the receiver at the destination.
      7.14.6.5. AIT capable units will label container and contents as required. Labels will be
      placed on the door near the consolidated data plate.
      7.14.6.6. Ensure all applicable DOT markings are properly affixed.
      7.14.6.7. RFID tags are detached from the outer container surface and reattached to the
      inside of the container door or consolidated into a central location immediately upon
      removal of assets. Reverse the battery to deactivate the tag prior to placing it inside the
      container. This prevents the container from being tracked as a loaded container in the
      transportation system.
      7.14.6.8. Ensure ISO containers prepared for shipment of munitions or used for storage
      are loaded using CAS Container Maintenance (AM106A) program as an ISO Container.
      ISO Container numbers will follow this format: USAF0018745. Any ISO containers
      shipped using MASS shipment procedures will be loaded as an ISO Container in CAS.
  7.14.7. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Shipments.
      7.14.7.1. When assets are authorized for release IAW paragraph 9.6 as an approved FMS
      case ensure all shipping documents are annotated with "Released IAW FMS-CASE
      XXXX‖ and attach copies of authorizing correspondence.
      7.14.7.2. When an existing Acquisition Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) authorizes
      the release of FMS assets, and the MAJCOM/C-NAF A4 (or equivalent) has approved
      the release, annotate all documents with ―Released IAW ACSA‖ and attach copies of
      authorizing correspondence to the shipping documents.
  7.14.8. Cancelled Shipments: When a shipment is processed in CAS but does not depart the
  installation (e.g., DDO is not updated), the shipment can be cancelled if necessary. Do not
  RVP the shipment in CAS. Personnel process a shipment cancellation IAW the Munitions
  Accountability Procedures Guide. The document may be cleared from the AME01A screen
  in CAS without filing.

7.15. Expenditures.
   7.15.1. General. Expenditures are processed to account for and document physical
   consumption of stock record and custody account munitions.
       7.5.1.1. Units will not use the Structure Expenditure (AM723A) process to remove
       assets from accountable record when aircraft depart/deploy from home station with
       munitions. Refer to paragraph 7.17, Deployed Munitions Management for these items.
       7.15.1.2. Ensure no one expends WRM munitions in peacetime without approval IAW
       AFI 25-101.
       7.15.1.3. Physical assets are categorized as WRM (or other category) when actually
       expended for that purpose, therefore, do not segregate WRM munitions in stock.
       7.15.1.4. Continuously monitor WRM munitions supportability by monitoring on-hand
       balances to WRM allocations and requisitions to achieve WRM munitions levels.
   7.15.2. Custody Account Expenditures: The consuming organization or activity provides the
   MASO with electronic expenditure requests within 5 duty days of expenditure. Refer to
   paragraph 7.4 for Custody Account Management procedures.
       7.15.2.1. Custodians will include the following on expenditure requests:
          7.15.2.1.1. Nomenclature.
          7.15.2.1.2. NSN.
          7.15.2.1.3. Quantity.
          7.15.2.1.4. Document Number.
          7.15.2.1.5. Lot/SN/CC.
          7.15.2.1.6. CAT Code.
          7.15.2.1.7. The words ―CLASSIFIED ITEM‖ (in red, bold, capital memorandum) if
          applicable.
          7.15.2.1.8. Digital signature of custody account custodian or organization
          commander.
   7.15.3. Stock Record Account Expenditures.
       7.15.3.1. Stockpile Expenditure data can be entered on an AF IMT 4331 (MTS) or an AF
       Form 2434 (or equivalent) and processed in CAS using the direct-input methods. Do not
       use direct-input for processing gun ammunition and countermeasure expenditures, see
       paragraph 7.1.2.2.2, 7.15.3.4.1, and 7.15.3.5.3. The AF IMT 4331 (MTS) or AF IMT
       2434 will be verified by Munitions Control and validated against the CAS daily
       transaction history by the MASO. The AF IMT 4331 (MTS) or AF IMT 2434 may be
       destroyed after validation.
       7.15.3.2. SOCOM and AFCENT units supporting non-traditional operations may
       manage assets on custody accounts, with AFSOC/AFCENT approval.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                          145


     7.15.3.3. Assets staged, assembled and configured for delivery/use remain on Stock
     Record Account until physically expended. Once physically expended, assets are
     expended in CAS against the appropriate CAT Code and ORG/SHP code.
     7.15.3.4. Controlling Expenditures: Control expenditures through active and continuous
     allocation and inventory management. Utilize the Level Reconciliation Listing
     (AMC12A) and CAS generated reports to ensure assets are not expended without an
     approved allocation.
        7.15.3.4.1. Aircraft gun ammunition is managed as a full load until weapons
        personnel download the gun and rounds expended are processed (validated) by
        maintenance.
        7.15.3.4.2. Chaff/Flare and aircraft gun ammunition expenditures are reconciled and
        processed in CAS only after the assets are returned to the munitions facility and
        processed.
            7.15.3.4.2.1. (Added-35FW) Chaff/flare aircraft loads with more than 50
            percent expenditures will be downloaded immediately.
     7.15.3.5. Aircraft Munitions Reconciliation: As aircraft recover, reconcile expenditures
     IAW this instruction. Aircraft expenditures will be documented on AF IMT 2434 (or
     local form) IAW AFI 21-101.
        7.15.3.5.1. Weapons loading, unloading, and expenditures activity will be
        documented on an AF IMT 2434 or AF IMT 4331 (MTS) and processed in CAS
        using direct-input methods, anytime these actions are not automatically processed
        into an automated system (i.e., handheld terminal barcode scanner, RFID tags, etc.).
        The AF IMT 2434 or AF IMT 4331 (MTS) will be turned in to the Munitions activity
        and used to validate daily processing of munitions transactions.
        7.15.3.5.2. Process stock record expenditure transactions in CAS using direct-input
        methods IAW paragraph 7.1.3. Personnel performing munitions tasks and operations
        (e.g., munitions crews, weapons expeditors) may process CAS transactions using
        laptop (wired/wireless) or Hand-held terminals (HHT); or CAS transaction data and
        information may be relayed by radio or phone.
        7.15.3.5.3. Do not wait until the end of the flying day to document and process sortie
        generation     or flightline expenditures, excluding gun ammunition and
        countermeasures.
        7.15.3.5.4. (Added-35FW) Weapons Load Crew Chiefs will legibly annotate all
        blocks on the 35 FW Form 23, ALS Worksheet, for all 20mm up loads/down loads.
        The 35 FW Form 23, ALS Worksheet will remain with the Universal Ammunition
        Loading System (UALS)/Linkless Ammunition Loading System (LALS).
        7.15.3.5.5. (Added-35FW) Weapons Load Crew Chiefs who return munitions for
        maintenance will ensure all broken, damaged, unserviceable and suspect assets, to
        include over-G‘d missiles, are reported to Munitions Control and identified with an
        AFTO Form 350, Repairable Item Processing Tag. The AFTO Form 350 tag must
        contain the following information: date, time, aircraft tail number, station/launcher

      number, a clear description of the discrepancy, Weapons Crew Chief‘s name and duty
      phone.
      7.15.3.5.6. (Added-35FW) Line drivers will ensure AFTO Form 350 tags are
      properly filled out by the weapons load crew prior to transporting item(s) from the
      flight line. Drivers will not move/replace assets until AFTO Form 350 tag is properly
      filled out. Notify Munitions Control of all tagged assets.
      7.15.3.5.7. (Added-35FW) Weapons Expeditors will ensure munitions safing
      devices removed for operational use are strictly controlled. Flight line personnel will
      turn-in all ―Remove Before Flight‖ streamers, BDU-33 safing blocks and safing
      devices from expended munitions to Munitions Line Driver after the last
      reconciliation. The quantity of safing devices will be verified against the total
      number of expended munitions. If any safing devices are unaccounted for, flight line
      personnel will conduct a thorough search for the missing item(s) and initiate a lost
      object report for items not found. The Munitions Flight will not deliver additional
      munitions until all munitions safing devices are accounted for.
      7.15.3.5.8. (Added-35FW) Missile safing gear will not be replaced until the
      responsible party has conducted the required search and initiated a lost object report.
      7.15.3.5.9. (Added-35FW) Flight line personnel will turn in all expended ARD
      impulse cartridges to Munitions Line Driver within two (2) hours of the last aircraft
      down time. If any expended carts are unaccounted for, flight line personnel will
      conduct a thorough search for the missing item(s) and initiate a lost object report for
      items not found. The Munitions Flight will not deliver additional munitions until all
      expended cartridges are returned.
      7.15.3.5.10. (Added-35FW) Conventional Maintenance personnel will physically
      verify all flight line expenditures/line returns upon return to the munitions storage
      area by using the Combat Ammunitions System (CAS) and applicable AF Form
      4331, Munitions Transaction Sheet, at the end of the flying day.
      7.15.3.5.11. (Added-35FW) Conventional Maintenance Element will process
      downloaded 20mm and brass upon return, not held to the end of the flying day. Prior
      to processing expenditures in CAS a physical count will be reconciled by the
      supervisor using the quantities in the gun log as delivered; 35 FW ALS Worksheet;
      quantities entered in CAS and quantity of expended brass.
      7.15.3.5.12. (Added-35FW) AMU Production Superintendent will direct download
      of munitions when requested by Munitions Control to facilitate inventory, inspection,
      repair, or preparation for deployment/TDY. Munitions download will occur within
      24 hours of request from Munitions Control.
      7.15.3.5.13. (Added-35FW) Munitions from transient aircraft will not be mixed
      with locally assigned assets.
      7.15.3.5.14. (Added-35FW) Weapons Load Crew Chiefs will provide expenditures
      of 20mm ammunition and aircraft countermeasures to line drivers within two (2)
      hours of last aircraft down time.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                            147


          7.15.3.5.15. (Added-35FW) Weapon Expeditors will expend munitions by CAS
          input from aircraft with the exception of all countermeasures (chaff, flare, ALE-50)
          and 20mm ammunition. Countermeasures and 20mm ammunition expenditures will
          be provided to munitions personnel IAW paragraph 7.15.3.5.14. Expenditure
          packages that include AF Form 2434 and CAS expenditure documentation will be
          provided to Munitions personnel no later than (4) hours of last aircraft downtime.
          Expenditure packages will be electronic and E-mailed to Munitions Operations
          (misawaFV5205@misawa.af.mil)             and       Munitions       Control       (35
          mxs/mxmwsa@misawa.af.mil).
       7.15.3.6. WRM Air-munitions Expenditures will be processed IAW paragraph 7.6.3.3.
       7.15.3.7. After stock record account expenditures are processed in CAS, the MASO will
       validate that these transactions were processed correctly by comparing the CAS AM903
       against the AF IMT 2434, AF IMT 4331 (MTS), and/or other documents. Discrepancies
       must be researched and corrected.
7.16. Turn-Ins. The user coordinates with the Munitions Flight to turn-in munitions. Turn-ins
as discussed in this chapter refer to returning assets to stock record account.
   7.16.1. There are five types of turn-ins:
       7.16.1.1. Organizational Turn-in (ORG TIN): Use the ORG TIN process for:
          7.16.1.1.1. Turn-in of assets when the origin is known. If the origin of assets is not
          known, use FOB Turn-in procedures in paragraph 7.16.1.5.
          7.16.1.1.2. Turn-in of components removed from an AUR.
          7.16.1.1.3. Turn-in of empty containers.
          7.16.1.1.4. Turn-in of static display munitions (SDM).
          7.16.1.1.5. Turn-in of recovered stock-listed assets previously adjusted off
          accountable record when a zero-balance exists. If a stock balance exists, refer to IAD
          Procedures in paragraph 7.11.14.
          7.16.1.1.6. Process ORG TIN using the CAS FOB Turn-In (AM555A) program.
              7.16.1.1.6.1. In the Comments block enter: ‗ORG TIN‘ and a brief description
              (e.g., Component TIN, Container TIN, Static Display TIN, or Recovered Asset
              TIN).
              7.16.1.1.6.2. When ‗ORG TIN‘ is annotated in the comments block, the
              mandatory documents outlined in paragraph 7.11.14, Inventory Adjustment
              Procedures are not required unless it meets the requirements of paragraph
              7.11.14.10.
          7.16.1.1.7. ORG TINs do not require a special inventory before processing an ORG
          TIN FOB transaction.
          7.16.1.1.8. For any recovered items that are non stock-listed, refer to procedures in
          paragraph 3.12.7.
       7.16.1.2. Custody Turn-in. Turn-in of assets from custody accounts.
148                                                 AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


      7.16.1.3. Expenditure Turn-in.
         7.16.1.3.1. This process will not be used to turn-in assets erroneously expended from
         a custody account. Units must RVP or inventory adjust to correct errors.
         7.16.1.3.2. Utilize the ‗Expenditure Turn-in‘ for assets originally consumption issued
         during the current FY, and was not consumed. Turn-in of assets originally
         consumption issued in a previous FY should be picked up using ORG TIN. If assets
         are classified ‗For Training Use Only‘, items can be reissued to custody accounts to
         fill authorized training allocations.
      7.16.1.4. Due-in From Maintenance (DIFM) Turn-in.
         7.16.1.4.1. Turn-in of assets originally issued under DIFM control. Use ORG TIN
         procedures for turn-in of assets that were issued in a previous FY and no replacement
         item is required.
         7.16.1.4.2. When an asset turned in from maintenance under a DIFM document
         number is not the same NSN as the issued asset, process the DIFM Turn-in using the
         NSN issued to clear the outstanding DIFM detail and then process a Selective Identity
         Change to correct the NSN to that of the turned in item.
         7.16.1.4.3. (Added-35FW) Submit DIFM turn-in requests to Munitions
         Accountability Element NLT 1600 hrs Monday or 1600 hrs the previous Friday if
         Monday is not a duty day. Munitions Accountability Element will ensure accuracy of
         all information and provide the request to Munitions Inspection Element. For turn-ins
         exceeding the 15-day limit, custodians will submit a signed memorandum of
         explanation, including document numbers, to Munitions Accountability. Trends will
         be up-channeled to the MASO for appropriate action.
      7.16.1.5. Found on Base (FOB) Turn-in.
         7.16.1.5.1. FOB turn-ins only include DOD stock-listed munitions where the origin
         of assets cannot be determined.
         7.16.1.5.2. For recovered items that are non stock-listed, refer to procedures in
         paragraph 3.12.7.
         7.16.1.5.3. The MASO reviews all FOB transactions to determine the need for a
         special inventory before processing the document. The MASO signs the document to
         indicate a review of special inventory requirements. These assets will be processed
         using the CAS FOB turn-in.
  7.16.2. Processing Turn-in Requests. All turn-in requests will include the following:
      7.16.2.1. Nomenclature
      7.16.2.2. NSN
      7.16.2.3. Quantity
      7.16.2.4. Lot Number
      7.16.2.5. CAT Code (if applicable)
      7.16.2.6. CC
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                            149


      7.16.2.7. Document number of the original issue (if applicable)
      7.16.2.8. Reason for turn-in
      7.16.2.9. In-checker signature, printed name, and date.
7.17. Deployed Munitions Management.
   7.17.1. Transferring Munitions for Deployment Support.
      7.17.1.1. Munitions Activities:
          7.17.1.1.1. Aircraft Munitions: When units tactical ferry munitions to a deployed
          location with an established SRAN/DODAAC, each deployed location will transfer
          assets using the ‗Import‘ option in the CAS Expeditor Management (AM2W1A)
          program. This process transfers the assets loaded on the specific aircraft from home
          station to the gaining DODAAC as stock assets eliminating the current practice of
          shipping and receiving assets. WSN records are also transferred retaining the original
          WSN. Note: Bulk assets will still be transferred utilizing the shipping/ receiving
          method.
             7.17.1.1.1.1. If the assets were assigned to a custody account the assets must be
             returned to stock then transferred to the gaining location as stock assets.
             7.17.1.1.1.2. Maintenance records and documentation for deployed CATM assets
             (i.e., TMRS) may be maintained and managed by the home station or at the
             deployed location at the discretion and agreement of Munitions Supervision at the
             deployed location and home station.
                 7.17.1.1.1.2.1. If managed at home station, Munitions Supervision at the
                 deployed location will ensure any inspection or maintenance actions are
                 promptly reported to the home station via e-mail.
                 7.17.1.1.1.2.2. If managed at the deployed location, home station Munitions
                 Supervision will ensure TMRS records are electronically transferred to the
                 deployed location. Munitions Supervision at the deployed location will
                 ensure records re maintained during the deployment and electronically
                 transferred back to the home station upon redeployment.
          7.17.1.1.2. Expenditures during In-transit: The MASO at the receiving location
          (gaining MASO) will ensure that a validation is conducted to verify quantity of assets
          received and expended. Expend the appropriate quantity against the ORG/SHP code
          as identified in paragraph 7.6.3.2.
          7.17.1.1.3. MAF Staged/Deployed WRM Countermeasures; Tactical Control
          (TACON) and non-TACON:
          7.17.1.1.3. 1. C-5/C-17 aircraft staged at OCONUS locations will not transfer
          TACON. Accountability will remain with the home station MASO until resupply is
          required.
             7.17.1.1.3.2. Countermeasures loaded on staged C-5/C-17 aircraft that require
             resupply will be imported at the time of download IAW paragraph 7.17.1.1.2. A
             CAS ADHOC report will be ran using the Containers table to identify both the
150                                                 AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


             owning DODAAC and current CAS maintaining DODAAC. The receiving
             location will coordinate with the losing location to obtain service life data.
             7.17.1.1.3.3. The aircraft container and associated munitions will only be
             imported by another SRAN/DODAAC when resupply is needed or when the
             staged aircraft returns to home station. Procedures in paragraph 7.17.1.1.4.2 will
             be used. Every effort will be made to ensure the Chaff-Flare Mag Container is
             loaded on one of the owning SRAN/DODAAC tails to ensure SPRAM
             accountability.
         7.17.1.1.4. C-130 deployed aircraft will transfer TACON and will be imported by the
         destination SRAN/DODAAC IAW paragraph 7.17.1.1.2. The receiving location will
         coordinate with the losing location to obtain service life data. The following is not
         authorized:
             7.17.1.1.4.1. Cross-loading of countermeasures from deploying or redeploying
             aircraft.
             7.17.1.1.4.2. Holding countermeasures from a deployed aircraft for loading
             during redeployment.
      7.17.1.2. Custody Accounts: If custodians require shipment of assets via the
      transportation activity to an established SRAN/DODAAC, assets will be turned in to the
      Munitions Storage Area and appropriate shipment documents processed. Shipment
      documents must be forwarded to the gaining MASO.
         7.17.1.2.1. If shipment is to a location with no established SRAN/DODAAC, contact
         C-NAF or Lead MAJCOM munitions staff, who will coordinate with the C-NAF or
         Lead MAJCOM with operational oversight of the deployment location to establish a
         SRAN/DODAAC IAW paragraph 9.2 or designate an existing SRAN/DODAAC to
         provide MASO oversight.
         7.17.1.2.2. In lieu of shipment, the MASO may request MAJCOM/C-NAF A4W (or
         equivalent) approval to retain deployed assets on custodial account.
         7.17.1.2.3. If custodians ship munitions using mobility channels, the MASO must
         turn-in and ship assets. Shipment documents will be forwarded to the gaining MASO
         at the SRAN/DODAAC designated by the C-NAF or Lead MAJCOM with
         operational oversight.
         7.17.1.2.4. The Installation Deployment Officer (IDO) or deployed commander will
         designate a responsible individual to be the munitions courier. The individual will be
         responsible for maintaining accountability of assets until they are turned in to the
         home-station or deployed MASO.
         7.17.1.2.5. Issue of munitions to individuals in support of contingency tasking
         without a custody account should be the exception and not the standard operating
         procedure. Deploying members must furnish a copy of their orders or other official
         communication (i.e., official e-mail) stating member must deploy with ammunition.
         7.17.1.2.6. If personnel must hand-carry weapons and munitions, the following
         procedures must be used:
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                           151


           7.17.1.2.6.1. The MASO must process turn-in (if required)/shipment (PTO) to
           applicable SRAN/ DODAAC, if known. A copy of the shipment document will
           be forwarded to the gaining MASO at the SRAN/DODAAC designated by
           MAJCOM/C-NAF with operational oversight. The MAJCOM/C-NAF will
           establish a SRAN/DODAAC IAW paragraph 9.2 or designate an existing
           SRAN/DODAAC to provide MASO oversight.
               7.17.1.2.6.1.1. Provide a copy of the shipment document to deploying
               individual.
               7.17.1.2.6.1.2. The following statement will be on the back of the shipment
               document and briefed to the member: ―Small arms ammunition will be
               controlled and the person receiving the munitions must maintain
               accountability and lot number integrity for these assets. The shipping
               document and munitions will be turned in to the Air Force munitions storage
               area at the deployed location. If a storage area has not been established,
               member will retain accountability for these assets. Member will document on
               the back of the shipment document if assets are expended or turned over to
               any other military storage area (Army, Navy, etc.). If turned over to a military
               authority, member will receive documentation showing who accepted
               accountability for the assets to include: Name, rank, organization, and home
               base DSN (Do not use SSN). This documentation will be given to the home
               station MASO upon return from deployment.
        7.17.1.2.7. Once munitions have been shipped or adjusted off record, units must
        contact the C-NAF or Lead MAJCOM for replacement procedures.
  7.17.2. The MASO manages WRM Mobility, CAT Code B munitions allocations and
  accounts.
     7.17.2.1. WRM Mobility, CAT Code B Allocation Management:
        7.17.2.1.1. CAT Code B munitions requirements will be validated by the functional
        areas they support and coordinated through and verified by the base/wing Installation
        Deployment Officer (IDO).
        7.17.2.1.2. Forecast requirements and load allocations for CAT Code BA and CAT
        Code BP miscellaneous mobility munitions covered in AFCAT 21-209 Volume 1,
        Ground Munitions in CAS against a single wing mobility account 002BP as an
        allocation management tool.
        7.17.2.1.3. Forecast requirements and load allocations for CAT Code B allocations
        (other than requirement code BA or BP) in CAS against the applicable unit account.
     7.17.2.2. WRM Mobility, CAT Code B Account Management:
        7.17.2.2.1. All CAT Code B munitions are generally managed as base stock assets to
        increase logistics flexibility, enhance capability to support various levels of effort,
        and reduce non-value added inventories and administrative tasks for accounts with
        little or no activity.
152                                                   AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


         7.17.2.2.2. Do not issue CAT Code B assets to the unit account or requirement code
         BA or BP to the wing/base account unless they meet requirements of paragraph
         7.17.2.2.4.
         7.17.2.2.3. When managed as base stock, CAT Code B mobility munitions will not
         be physically segregated and will be inventoried as base stock assets.
         7.17.2.2.4. Each functional community with a CAT Code B allocation must provide
         justification to the MASO and IDO to determine if mobility munitions should be
         issued to custody account. Issuing CAT Code B munitions to custody account should
         only be considered when:
             7.17.2.2.4.1. Mission circumstances dictate immediate access and control over
             munitions and issue/shipment procedures cannot support required timelines.
             7.17.2.2.4.2. The unit/agency requires frequent deployment of munitions to
             locations without an established SRAN.
             7.17.2.2.4.3. When either of the above condition is met, the MASO may issue
             CAT Code B munitions. Limit custody accounts to one per separate residual force
             (i.e., PRIME BEEF, security forces, EOD, OSI, etc.)
         7.17.2.2.5. Do not release assets prior to execution or mobilization. Exception:
         During local exercises, physical assets may be broken out, staged for deployment, and
         processed as ‗bulk-shipped‘ assets.         Ensure proper security and transfer
         documentation for these assets IAW paragraph 7.17.1.2. The shipping document will
         be generated using the CAS Training database to demonstrate the capability to
         generate the shipping paperwork.
      7.17.2.3. Do not requisition replacements for assets deployed from home station.
      Requisitions may be submitted after expenditures are validated and processed or
      shipments are processed removing assets from the stock record account.
  7.17.3. Issue of Non-NCAA WRM Small Arms in Support of Emergencies: Installation
  Commanders are authorized to direct (in writing) issue of Non-NCAA WRM small arms
  ammunition to USAF personnel for periods up to 30 calendar days to support disaster relief,
  humanitarian missions, and major accident responses. E-mail is acceptable to direct this
  authority.
      7.17.3.1. Written release authority shall include:
         7.17.3.1.1. Nomenclature.
         7.17.3.1.2. NSN.

     MANAGEMENT HEADQUARTERS AND CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT
                  MUNITIONS RESPONSIBILITIES

8.1. Introduction: Lead MAJCOM designations outlined in AFPD 10-9, Lead Command
Designation and Responsibilities For Weapon Systems, Program Action Directive (PAD) 06-09,
Implementation of The Chief Of Staff of The Air Force Direction to Establish an Air Force
Component Organization, and PAD 07-13, Implementation of The Chief Of Staff of The Air
Force Direction to Transform and Consolidate Headquarters Management Functions primarily
apply to Weapons Systems management and sustainment. For the purposes of Conventional
Munitions Maintenance Management, Lead MAJCOM designations are align differently to
appropriately reflect essential and necessary munitions HQ and CMA functions, roles, and
relationships.
   8.1.1. Reachback Relationships:
       8.1.1.1. For long-term munitions system management issues, wings/groups work directly
       with Lead MAJCOMs and CMAs, and share information within echelon MAJCOM and
       NAF.
       8.1.2.2. The C-NAF is the primary point of contact for contingency planning and
       execution issues. Day-to-day munitions management and technical issues will be
       addressed to Lead MAJCOMs/CMAs (See paragraph 8.4 for specific C-NAF roles).
       8.1.1.3. Lead MAJCOMs and CMAs will provide staff support covering duty hours of
       both Lead and Supported MAJCOMs.
       8.1.1.4. Lead MAJCOMs and CMAs coordinate technical support and provide guidance
       on issues beyond unit capabilities through the technical order waiver process, technical
       data assistance requests and through reachback to supported agencies.
       8.1.1.5. For munitions management purposes, Table 8.1 aligns Management HQ and
       CMAs to support tactical and operational munitions functions/operations. Organize,
       Train and Equip (OT&E) activities follow traditional roles for Lead MAJCOMs.
8.2. Lead MAJCOM Munitions Staff (or equivalent). A MAJCOM that has been designated
as the executive agent or command with the primary responsibility of providing a capability
including equipment. A Lead MAJCOM is responsible for organizing, training, equipping, and
providing forces. Lead MAJCOMs provide weapons systems management and reachback
support to units, C-NAFs, NAFs with no component role, CMAs, and Supported MAJCOMs.
   8.2.1. For the purpose of munitions system/sustainment management, Lead MAJCOMs are
   as outlined in Table 8.1. ACC is the CAF Lead for management and coordination of all
   munitions, equipment, and sustainment issues and will ensure coordination with other Lead,
   Component, and Supported Commands. For AFMC, AMC, and AFSOC that are both Lead
   and Supported MAJCOMs, the role of the Lead MAJCOM Munitions Staff pertains only to
   those munitions and associated equipment for which they hold Lead MAJCOM
   responsibility.

                    CONVENTIONAL MUNITIONS MANAGEMENT

9.1. Managing Stock Record Account Numbers/Department of Defense Activity Address
Codes (SRAN/DODAAC).
   9.1.1. HQ AFMC/A4MW is the focal point for munitions SRANs/DODAACs. A
   SRAN/DODAAC as used in this instruction refers to active or contingency munitions
   accounts.
   9.1.2. An installation may maintain more than one conventional munitions account when
   separate storage areas/facilities exist on the same installation (i.e., War Reserve Stock for
   Allies). Requests for additional SRANs/DODAACs will clearly indicate why it is in the best
   interest of the Air Force.
   9.1.3. Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve (AFRC) organizations may
   establish a SRAN/DODAAC at any installation where the ANG or AFRC maintains an
   active munitions operation.
9.2. Establishing a SRAN/DODAAC. Lead MAJCOMs, ARC, and C-NAFs:
   9.2.1. Establish, change, or delete a SRAN/DODAAC IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 1,
   Part 2, Chapter 1, Air Force DODAACs, SRANs, And Station Numbers and paragraph 9.2.3.
   If the locations are controlled or classified, classify the request appropriately. Controlled
   addresses are published with ‗controlled‘ as the clear text address.
   9.2.2. Maintain a classified list of their controlled SRANs/DODAACs. Provide this listing to
   the USAF GACP (784 CBSG) whenever updates are accomplished.
   9.2.3. Request addition/change/deletion of a SRAN/DODAAC by submitting them on-line
   through the SRAN/DODAAC Web Management System at: https://DODaac.wpafb.af.mil.
   Select ‗Request SRAN/DODAAC‘, ‗Change SRAN/DODAAC‘, or ‗Delete
   SRAN/DODAAC‘ as applicable. After SRAN/DODAAC has been added/changed/deleted,
   ensure CAS is updated by sending addition/change/deletion information to the CAS PMO.
   9.2.4. Maintain accuracy of SRAN/DODAAC information by updating CAS or other
   applicable systems and coordinating changes with the SRAN/DODAAC monitor identified
   at: https://DODaac.wpafb.af.mil.
9.3. CAS Management. CAS is an unclassified system IAW DOD 8510.01, DOD Information
Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP). Roles are assigned to every
individual with access to CAS IAW Table 9.1.
   9.3.1. System Administration Levels. There are four levels of system administration for
   CAS. These levels are: CAS SPO (Functional SA), ACP SA, MAJCOM SA, and the Local
   (base) SA. Depending upon their level of authorization, the SA has the capability to add,
   change, or delete a CAS user from the system. The SA also has the ability to assign
   permissions to each user that specifies which programs and or functional areas may be
   accessed. In order for the menu to be created dynamically upon user login, the SA must
   assign permissions using the CAS User Management (AMA01A) program to designate

  specific programs for individual user access. A description of the SA responsibilities is listed
  below.
     9.3.1.1. The CAS SPO is able to assign CAS_USER roles to all levels of CAS personnel.
     The assignment of the admin role will be accomplished using a tiered method where
     754th ELSG/ILMW will have overall authority. 754th ELSG/ILMW CAS SPO will be
     responsible for assigning the CAS_ADMIN-MAJCOM privilege to Lead MAJCOM SAs,
     who will in-turn be responsible for assigning the CAS_ADMIN-BASE privilege to the
     local administrators at the bases within the Lead Command domain. When the SA is
     assigned the CAS_ADMIN role they have the ability to assign the CAS_USER role to
     anyone at their level and below.
     9.3.1.2. CAS Functional System Administrator (FSA) Level. These individuals are
     assigned to the CAS Program Management Office (PMO) and are responsible for the
     administration of the CAS application database. These FSAs will act as the
     intermediaries for the Defense Information Systems Agency and the CAS functional
     users. If a problem arises where a database recovery would be required, the FSA will
     inform DISA of the need for recovery of the database. CAS FSA Administration

      9.3.1.3. Appointment of Lead MAJCOM SA. The Lead MAJCOM A4W or A4M (or
      equivalent) will appoint a primary and alternate Lead MAJCOM CAS administrator in
      writing. A copy of the appointment memorandum will be provided to 754 ELSG/ILMW.
      The appointment memorandum will be validated annually. When the primary or
      alternate administrator is relieved of his/her duties, a new appointment memorandum
      must be accomplished identifying the successor and will reference the superseded
      memorandum.
         9.3.1.3.1. Upon receipt and validation of the appointment memorandum 754
         ELSG/ILMW will assign the CAS Admin-MAJCOM role to the Lead MAJCOM SA
         identified in the memorandum. Once the Admin-MAJCOM role is assigned to the
         Lead MAJCOM SA and appears in the SA's Air Force Portal, he or she will then be
         able to access the AF portal link. This will not grant access to the CAS application.
         The Lead MAJCOM SA will then have to be loaded to the CAS application using the
         Admin menu, user management option in the application software to be able to access
         the application software.

      MAJCOM SA can load CAS roles to MAJCOM users and base users within their command
      in the application software. The Local Base System Administrators will be appointed in
      writing and a copy of the appointment memorandum will be provided to the MAJCOM SA.
      (See also paragraphs 2.6.10. and 7.2.5.2.)
          9.3.2.1. Once the MAJCOM SA has validated the appointment memorandum, the
          MAJCOM SA assigns the CAS Admin-Base role to the local Base SAs within their
          command. The user will still need to be granted access to the application software using
          Administration menu, user management.
          9.3.2.2. The MAJCOM SA is granted privileges to add, change, or delete MAJCOM or
          base level users and administrators within their commands. The MAJCOM SA will grant

          decisions in AMST prior to the MMP GAP working group convening.
9.8. The Munitions Requisitioning System.
   9.8.1. The requisitioning system provides the method to obtain required munitions.
       9.8.1.1. Approved stock levels may be exceeded when requisitioning items in QUP or
       quantity per shipping container (QSC).
       9.8.1.2. To ensure assets will be available for use at the beginning of the fiscal year:
          9.8.1.2.1. The GACP provide requisitioning guidance to OCONUS units.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                                 203


          9.8.1.2.2. CONUS units‘ requisition (call forward) up to 25-percent of near-year
          short-supply allocations based upon asset availability as determined by the IM and
          GACP.
          9.8.1.2.3. Final call forward levels are determined by the GAP working group during
          completion of positioning objective and recorded in the final DLAR. The positioning
          objective does not include projected expenditures or pending deliveries. Asset
          availability is defined as assets currently in the USAF inventory. It does not include
          pending deliveries or projected expenditures.
       9.8.1.3. When an ALC IM suspects a unit is abusing the priority system, the IM or PM
       should contact the GACP support cell to validate the priority.
       9.8.1.4. The ALC IM or PM will not change a requisition priority without contacting the
       GACP support cell to validate the priority.
       9.8.1.5. Requisitions submitted to support the annual DLAR will identify the appropriate
       fiscal year for which the DLAR applies.
   9.8.2. The GACP may cross command lines to manage munitions logistics inventory. The
   Lead MAJCOM or C-NAF munitions staff will coordinate redistribution actions using the
   GAP/MMP. Redistribution of AFRC and ANG assets will be coordinated with HQ AFRC or
   NGB.
   9.8.3. MICAP requisitions (Required Delivery Date (RDD) 999) are not authorized, except
   when the lack of an item causes grounding of a MICAP reportable end item identified by the
   standard reporting designator (SRD) found in T.O. 00-20-2.
       9.8.3.1. Units with MICAP requisitions will contact the appropriate GACP Support Cell
       via the CRM located at: https://www.my.af.mil/wm/ and telephone at DSN: 777-
       2666/775-2666 of Commercial: (801) 940-2270 as soon as possible after submitting a
       MICAP requisition in CAS. The appropriate GACP Support Cell will work directly with
       the IM and the designated shipping activity to facilitate the quickest MICAP processing
       to the requesting unit. Include supporting justification, such as aircraft ground date, intra-
       theater support options, and any related communications.
       9.8.3.2. Due to commercial transportation shipping constraints at Hill AFB, field units
       must make every effort to submit and notify GACP Customer Support Center of MICAP
       requisitions (DSN 777-2666, 775-2666; Comm 801 940-2270) NLT Saturday, 0900
       Mountain Time. This will allow the MICAP to be shipped by 1200 that day. MICAP
       requests received after 0900 Mountain Time on Saturday will be processed and shipped
       the next duty day.
9.9. Disposition of Munitions.
   9.9.1. ALC PGMs will conduct an annual stockpile analysis to identify serviceable excess
   assets following requirements determination through the NCAA process. Disposition of
   serviceable excess assets will be determined during the TAMP and DLAR processes and
   prioritized for movement in the annual GAP and MMP.
   9.9.2. The PGMs directs redistribution via a RDO of excess serviceable items to satisfy
   worldwide requirements.
 204                                                   AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


       9.9.2.1. These RDOs will be coordinated with the Lead/Supported MAJCOM or C-NAF.
   9.9.3. PGMs shall receive and process ADRs via the automated ADR system on the 784
   CBSG website: https://www.my.af.mil/ammoprod/wm/.
       9.9.3.1. The PGM will establish a central ADR processing function to ensure alternative
       uses of reported munitions are fully considered before authorizing disposal of non-
       hazardous munitions.
       9.9.3.2. Processing function personnel should be experienced in munitions manufacture,
       use, storage/transportation, inspection, accountability, and stockpile management.
       9.9.3.3. The appropriate USAF DDA will provide disposition instructions within 60
       calendar days after receipt of an ADR. These instructions may direct shipment of non-
       hazardous munitions to any of the following locations: a base from a different MAJCOM;
       a storage location; a repair/recovery/ recycling facility; an Army or Navy location; a FMS
       destination; or (as a last resort) a TTU.
       9.9.3.4. The DDA will maintain a record of all ADRs for a period of three years. The
       purpose is to provide details of individual evaluations upon request.
   9.9.4. The PGMs (784 CBSG and 782 CBSG) are the DDA for the Air Force. The SMCA is
   the DDA for the DOD.
       9.9.4.1. As defined in the MMR, they are the only persons who are authorized to identify
       military munitions items as WMM.
       9.9.4.2. Hazardous munitions items designated by EOD as Level 1 or Level 2 do not
       require DDA approval prior to emergency disposal.
9.10. 784 CBSG COTS Procedures. (See Figure 9.1., Munitions System Management, Hazard
Classification & Safety Certification Process.)
   9.10.1. Munitions System Management. Determination for management through the
   munitions system is made by the PM.
       9.10.1.1. This determination is based on the ability to assign an existing (like item) T.O.,
       obtain SPI, account for items through CAS, budgeting and procurement requirements,
       and the ability to provide disposition for unserviceable and excess items.
          9.10.1.1.1. Because munitions items are centrally procured assets, they are generally
          prohibited from local purchase. Units can be authorized to locally procure munitions
          items with PM approval, however, to do so, the PM must provide the procurement
          funds, therefore, the PM must consider provisions of AFI 65-601, Vol. 1, Budget
          Guidance and Procedures related to local purchase (LP) of centrally procured items
          when making these decisions.
          9.10.1.1.2. When the PM has approved a waiver for local purchase of centrally
          procured items, and the local base supply officer (MASO for munitions) approves the
          transaction, use customer funds for initial and follow-on procurement.
       9.10.1.2. If the PM determines requested munitions are not manageable within the
       munitions system, the request may proceed for interim HC and NNMSB safety
       certification.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                             205


   9.10.2. NNMSB Certification. COTS munitions purchase request data packages will be
   reviewed by 505 CBSS/GBBA for completeness to provide the NNMSB with sufficient
   information to certify COTS munitions for Air Force use. If additional data is required,
   NNMSB member(s) will coordinate through 505 CBSS/GBBA.
   9.10.3. HC includes assigning hazard class and division, compatibility group, United
   Nations (UN) number, and explosive weight. An IHC or HC must be assigned prior to
   placing munitions into operational service.
      9.10.3.1. The Air Force Safety Center assigns final HC for Air Force munitions upon
      completion of formal testing and/or analysis IAW T.O. 11A-1-47.
      9.10.3.2. An IHC will be issued for a period of one year. Extensions may be granted
      provided the requesting unit provides complete justification and has submitted data to the
      appropriate GACP Support Cell via the CRM located at: https://www.my.af.mil/wm/ to
      obtain a final hazard classification.
      9.10.3.3. COTS munitions packages disapproved for IHC or final HC will be returned to
      the requesting unit. COTS munitions with expired IHC will not be used until revalidated
      or final HC is approved.
   9.10.4. Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Program. The 784 CBSG and the NNMSB
   approves BASH munitions using the procedures prescribed in paragraph 7.21 and 9.10.2.
   9.10.5. Air Force Shooting Program (AFSP) Munitions Management. AFI 34-271, Air
   Force Shooting Program (AFSP) is the governing directive for the USAF Competitive
   Shooting Team. AFSP munitions are approved according to procedures in paragraph 7.21.8.
9.11. Conventional Munitions Product Assurance Management.
   9.11.1. Life-Cycle Management Concept - Introduction: Product assurance concerns exist
   from the inception of a munitions item until it is properly disposed. With this in mind,
   personnel at all echelons are stakeholders in the process. This entails proper design, life
   cycle testing, the inspection process and reporting of discrepancies. These procedures are
   essential for establishing the foundation of product assurance for munitions.
      9.11.1.1. All higher headquarters and management activities with units that use
      conventional munitions items have product assurance duties:
          9.11.1.1.1. Ensure subordinate organizations establish viable product assurance
          programs according to paragraph 3.1 and use PQDR, AFTO Form 22, AFTO Form
          102 or alternative electronic means to identify munitions reliability, maintainability,
          or deficiency concerns to the responsible AFMC ALC.
          9.11.1.1.2. Screen safety and accident investigation reports and ensures any
          munitions issues are referred to the appropriate ALC.
          9.11.1.1.3. Ensure procedures to monitor and survey condition of munitions in
          storage and service are complied with.
          9.11.1.1.4. Evaluate skills and personnel who conduct product assurance and identify
          training requirements to the Career Field Manager (CFM) and AETC during the
          U&TW.
206                                                AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


         9.11.1.1.5. Review reliability and maintainability reports from the ALCs and
         determine minimum acceptable performance criteria below which munitions have no
         identifiable combat utility. Coordinate with HQ USAF and the responsible ALC to
         remove from service and inventory, or restrict to training use only, those items that
         fall below established combat performance criteria.
         9.11.1.1.6. If charged with developing mission need statements, ensure to indicate
         assets must be made available for life-cycle testing. Also, incorporate design and
         inspection desires to ensure asset reliability while minimizing manpower impacts.
         9.11.1.1.7. Participate in forums and working groups to resolve product assurance
         problems.
         9.11.1.1.8. Assess the effectiveness of munitions product assurance programs during
         unit-level surveillance visits.
      9.11.1.2. AFMC has the primary responsibility for munitions product assurance to
      include:
         9.11.1.2.1. Ensuring resource allocation to support product assurance commensurate
         with the importance of high quality and reliable munitions.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                   207

         9.11.1.2.2. Investigating munitions deficiencies reported by using commands and
         units. Report reliability and maintainability results from investigations and
         surveillance testing to using commands. The ALCs will establish tracking systems to
         monitor trends and analyze data. The ALCs will provide MAJCOMs and other
         customers with reports to provide results of the data analysis.
         9.11.1.2.3. Establishing, maintaining, and managing technical information and
         content for inspecting, testing, storing, maintaining, handling, transporting,
         packaging, preserving, disposing, reconditioning, modifying, renovating and
         containerizing conventional munitions.
         9.11.1.2.4. Ensuring surveillance is maintained over Air Force munitions stored by
         other Services. This includes ensuring the storing service is properly using allocated
         funds to store, inspect and maintain munitions.
         9.11.1.2.5. Conducting surveillance visits to other services‘ storage sites containing
         Air Force assets every 2 years to determine the effectiveness of their munitions
         product assurance program. At the end of surveillance visit, conduct an out briefing
         with the other services‘ representatives to discuss noted deficiencies. Furnish a
         detailed written report of the surveillance visit to the agencies responsible for storage
         site. Report will identify all deficiencies, their main causes, recommended changes,
         training requirements and personnel contacted during the visit. Furnish the Air Staff,
         Lead MAJCOMs and the ARC a copy of the written report on the status of the Air
         Force stockpile stored at other services‘ sites.
  9.11.2. Product Design.
      9.11.2.1. Design Considerations.
         9.11.2.1.1. Product assurance for conventional munitions must begin during the
         conceptual phase of the acquisition process and be continued throughout the life-
         cycle of the item.
         9.11.2.1.2. Munitions agencies ensure consideration is given to the operating
         environment faced by munitions. Munitions are stockpiled for extended periods,
         withdrawn, and cycled from a ready state back to storage numerous times before
         finally being employed or disposed of. In the case of some munitions, electrical
         continuity tests or power-on operations may be a part of this cycling.
         9.11.2.1.3. Munitions require a dual consideration of reliability. Munitions must
         perform their mission on demand (performance) and must not function prematurely,
         inadvertently, or in some other unexpected manner (safety). Both aspects of
         reliability must be monitored and stringently controlled to ensure combat readiness is
         maintained and unintended personnel injury or property damage is prevented.
         9.11.2.1.4. Future maintenance requirements, such as component access for periodic
         inspection requirements, must be considered in the design stage. Additionally,
         adequate attention must be given to packaging, handling, and transporting
         requirements, to include explosive HC for transportation and storage as well as the
         operational (ground handling/storage and flying) environment. Design criteria must
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                           209


         also include environmental protection issues for consideration during daily use and
         for disposal purposes.
         9.11.2.1.5. Accurate configuration control of the items must be maintained.
         Changing NSNs of an item after modifications or TCTO changes promotes
         configuration control.
         9.11.2.1.6. Ensure throughout the munitions item life-cycle that accurate
         configuration control of the item engineering design is maintained.
         9.11.2.1.7. During design phase, consideration must be given to the future need to
         demilitarize/dispose of the item and, where possible, materials are selected that make
         this process easier. Lean towards reclamation potential as much as possible.
            9.11.2.1.7.1. AFMC implements Design for Demilitarization ‗DEMIL‘ (DFD) as
            an acquisition initiative into the systems engineering process for all newly
            developed ammunition items and those undergoing engineering changes or
            renovation and maintenance.
            9.11.2.1.7.2. Military Service material developers will follow guidance and best
            management practices provided by SMCA, to influence ammunition design in
            order to facilitate ‗DEMIL‘ operations. The goal is to increase R3, reduced
            execution cost, minimized reuse/disposal costs, enhanced safety, and
            environmental compliance.
            9.11.2.1.7.3. Provide representatives from both the acquisition and ‗DEMIL‘
            functional areas to participate in the DFD program.
         9.11.2.1.8. Provide Technical Data packages for newly fielded conventional
         ammunitions and components to allow characterization and development of DEMIL
         plans and technologies.
     9.11.2.2. Initial service life and shelf life dates for munitions are based on design,
     manufacturing processes, materials and performance testing.
  9.11.3. Product Assurance Procedures.
     9.11.3.1. Product Assurance Reporting.
         9.11.3.1.1. All Munitions Squadrons, Flights, Elements and Munitions-using
         organizations have key product assurance responsibilities to formally report any/all
         conditions that could lead to injury or prevent a munitions item from functioning
         properly. Reporting methods are outlined in paragraph 3.1.1.
         9.11.3.1.2. Munitions-Managing Organizations.
            9.11.3.1.2.1. Report to munitions-using organizations by official e-mail anytime
            munitions items are placed into a suspended or restricted status.
            9.11.3.1.2.2. Report back to the submitting organization within 72 hours upon
            receipt of a PQDR. Acknowledge receipt of PQDR and provide any additional
            information regarding resolution of problem.
            9.11.3.1.2.3. If involved in the investigation of an accident or incident involving
            munitions, provide an initial assessment to other potential users of the asset.

      9.11.3.2. Munitions Inspections and Surveillance:
         9.11.3.2.1. Munitions activities and munitions-using organizations perform required
         inspections IAW paragraph 3.1.1.
         9.11.3.2.2. Munitions-Managing Organizations.
             9.11.3.2.2.2. Issue special and one-time inspection guidance and procedures as
             required.
             9.11.3.2.2.3. Ensure product assurance responsibilities are met for munitions
             items managed by other services.
      9.11.3.3. Mishap and Incident Investigations. 784 CBSG maintains a MRRT of
      personnel knowledgeable in all aspects of munitions to respond to incidents involving
      munitions. Procedures for contacting team are provided in paragraph 2.5.23.1.
      9.11.3.4. Testing. Most munitions are ‗one-shot‘ devices. Reliability for ‗one-shot‘
      devices with time-dependent failure characteristics cannot be measured absolutely.
      Therefore, inferences must be made on reliability and useful life based on observing the
      performance of representative samples.
         9.11.3.4.1. Munitions-managing organizations ensure procurement of munitions
         items includes sufficient quantities for surveillance and aging testing throughout the
         forecast life-cycle of the item. Also ensure procurement includes sufficient assets for
         explosives safety and disposal testing.
         9.11.3.4.2. Ensure munitions test information and all available historical data (ADR,
         PQDR, CAS Inspection History, etc) is used to periodically update munitions
         performance and reliability data and revise munitions inspection and surveillance
         intervals in appropriate technical data.
         9.11.3.4.3. Product Development Testing. Good documentation of item performance
         during product development testing is essential to long-term product assurance.
             9.11.3.4.3.1. Ensure Explosive Hazard Classification HC test data and detailed
             performance data are incorporated in munitions surveillance plans.
             9.11.3.4.3.2. Ensure Lot Acceptance Test (LAT) data is captured and
             incorporated in surveillance plans.
         9.11.3.4.4. Surveillance Testing. Surveillance testing is intended to detect and
         measure the gradual changes in munitions before those changes cause the item and/or
         system to fail. Predicting future changes based on current measurements allows shelf
         life and service determinations. While operational tests and training events
         demonstrate whether a munitions system functioned or not, little useful surveillance
         information is usually obtained.
             9.11.3.4.4.1. Perform failure analysis testing if necessary to isolate causes of
             munitions failures and to determine if problem is widespread.
             9.11.3.4.4.2. Perform periodic testing of munitions to assess the impacts of aging
             on item reliability and performance. Testing should not only include those
             explosive components which suffer from chemical deterioration but any
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                           211


            component of the munitions system which is critical to system operation and
            safety.
            9.11.3.4.4.3. Match test frequency to predicted item deterioration or to impact of
            item failure. When determining what munitions to test, consider high flight-hour
            accumulation of certain assets.
     9.11.3.5. Reliability Assessment and Product Deficiencies.
        9.11.3.5.1. Product Assurance Standards.
            9.11.3.5.1.1. Munitions-using and munitions-managing organizations establish
            performance and reliability standards during item development. Document the
            performance standards in Mission Needs Statements (MNS) and Capability
            Production Document (CPD) as well as surveillance test plans.
            9.11.3.5.1.2. If determined appropriate, negotiate product warranties and
            guarantees with the item developer. Manage the warranted item to ensure
            warranty conditions are not violated and conduct surveillance testing of the item
            prior to warranty expiration to insure it meets warranted standards.
        9.11.3.5.2. Product Assessment.
            9.11.3.5.2.1. Munitions-management organizations gather munitions performance
            information from all available sources in reaching a product reliability
            assessment.
            9.11.3.5.2.2. Compile information from munitions inspections conducted by both
            munitions-using and managing organizations.
            9.11.3.5.2.3. Ensure performance reports are received from operational
            evaluations of combat weapon systems and a solid review is conducted.
            9.11.3.5.2.4. PQDRs provide useful information about the failure modes of an
            item and organizations are required to use the PQDR process to identify
            munitions failures and discrepancies.
            9.11.3.5.2.5. Surveillance testing will continue to provide the bulk of product
            assurance information and a test program must be conducted periodically
            throughout an item's service life.
        9.11.3.5.3. Product Analysis.
            9.11.3.5.3.1. Use actual test data when available for reliability determination and
            service life prediction.
            9.11.3.5.3.2. Long Range Services Life Analysis (LRSLA) is a structural failure
            prediction model, which assists in establishing the service life of missile
            propulsion systems. Other computer models are coming into use to assist in
            determining reliability and service life of other conventional munitions items and
            their use is strongly encouraged.
            9.11.3.5.3.3. If product performance has changed, (e.g., range, accuracy,
            lethality, etc.) ensure using commands and the Joint Munitions Effectiveness
            Manuals Group (JMEM) are made aware of the current level of performance.
212                                                  AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


         9.11.3.5.4. Product Deficiency. When munitions are reported (through any means) to
         the PM or IM as deficient through inspection, testing, failure or any other means, a
         number of actions become possible.
            9.11.3.5.4.1. Item(s), SN(s), or lot number(s) restriction or suspension.
                9.11.3.5.4.1.1. Restriction or suspension of a munitions item is usually an
                interim action until one of the four actions listed in paragraphs 9.11.3.4.4
                through 9.11.3.5.4.5 are taken.
                9.11.3.5.4.1.2. Restrict an item when it does not conform to all specifications
                but is still serviceable for certain applications.
                9.11.3.5.4.1.3. Suspend an item when its true condition is not known, it is
                determined unserviceable, or its service life has expired. Additional
                information on CCs for munitions is contained in T.O. 11A-1-10.
            9.11.3.5.4.2. Warranty Action.
                9.11.3.5.4.2.1. If a deficient item was procured with a manufacturer's
                warranty, invoke the warranty.
                9.11.3.5.4.2.2. Ensure appropriate program management personnel are aware
                of warranty conditions and expiration dates.
            9.11.3.5.4.3. Accept deficiency - adjust service life. Occasionally the munitions-
            using and managing organizations will reach agreement that a munitions
            deficiency is too costly to correct, the asset is too mission-critical to restrict, or
            has insufficient impact on system performance to warrant correction.
                9.11.3.5.4.3.1. If appropriate, adjust the service life of the item or the use
                restriction code.
                9.11.3.5.4.3.2. If the deficiency changes the performance of a system, ensure
                all appropriate technical manuals are updated with the correct information.
            9.11.3.5.4.4. Initiate product improvement program. The decision to correct an
            item deficiency is jointly reached by the munitions-using and managing
            organizations.
            9.11.3.5.4.5. Dispose or retire an item. Munitions items that have reached the
            end of their service life, as well as those of questionable reliability, must be
            retired from the inventory.
  9.11.4. Additional Product Assurance Responsibilities.
      9.11.4.1. Lead MAJCOM. All munitions items have a designated Lead MAJCOM.
      AFMC is the Lead MAJCOM for most munitions items, however, ACC, AFSOC, and
      AMC have specific Lead MAJCOM responsibilities for munitions due to Operational
      Test & Evaluation (OT&E) requirements for emerging systems and unique SOF or MAF
      requirements. These Lead MAJCOMs will:
         9.11.4.1.1. Ensure that munitions concerns are closely worked with the managing
         organization until resolution.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                          213


         9.11.4.1.2. Identify to the appropriate ALC, munitions items that are excess or
         obsolete so disposition actions can be initiated.
     9.11.4.2. Munitions/Missile PIWGs are conducted by the Munitions Product Group IAW
     AFI 21-118, Improving Air and Space Equipment Reliability and Maintainability,
     Chapter 3 to improve product reliability and maintainability. Minimum PIWG
     membership composition includes the single manager(s), system support manager(s),
     Lead Command Executive Agent, and a representative from each of using command.
  9.11.5. Requests to Modify Inspection Interval Requirements.
     9.11.5.1. Requests to change inspection/surveillance intervals for munitions items may
     require T.O. changes. Submit these requests using AFTO Form 22.
         9.11.5.1.1. Do not submit requests on items under warranty. Requests must be
         inclusive of the National Stock Number (NSN) and not individual lots or local storage
         or handling conditions.
         9.11.5.1.2. Requests will include Lead MAJCOM coordinated data and justification
         to increase or decrease in inspection or surveillance requirements. Examples of
         supporting data may include: surveillance interval data, quantity of items inspected,
         defects discovered, type of defects discovered, defect rates, number of ADR
         submitted, number of QDRs submitted, etc.
         9.11.5.1.3. Once coordinated by Lead MAJCOM munitions staffs, the originating
         command forwards the AFTO Form 22 to the applicable ALC (784 CBSG or 782
         CBSG) who will then forward the request to the appropriate office for evaluation.
         The ES will respond to these requests using normal AFTO Form 22 response
         procedures.
     9.11.5.2. Procedures above do not preclude Air Staff or Lead MAJCOM from requesting
     broad management analysis or review of munitions items or an item series for special
     review or analysis based on prevailing field conditions. These requests should be fully
     supported by field level data and information.

                                         Chapter 10

                   WAR RESERVE MATERIEL (WRM) MUNITIONS

10.1. General. WRM munitions are required to support wartime activities listed in the USAF
War and Mobilization Plan (WMP) until the industrial base meets wartime demands. The
forward presence stressed in the defense planning guidance (DPG) demands WRM munitions to
be stored or moved quickly to critical areas. WRM munitions are pre-positioned at operating
bases, dispersed in areas of responsibility, placed aboard APF vessels, and stored at selected
units and depots for surface or air deployment.
   10.1.1. Refer to attachment 1, Glossary of References and Supporting Information for
   definitions of the War Mobilization Plan (WMP), Vol. 1 through Vol. 5, LOGFAC, WCDO,
   NCAA, TAMP, and DLAR.
   10.1.2. Refer to paragraph 3.5 for instructions and guidance on classifying information used,
   controlled, or produced from manual or automated munitions systems.
10.2. Positioning Objectives. The C-NAF/Lead Command will provide units with WRM
munitions positioning objectives using the WCDO for wartime requirements. AFI 25-101,
WCDO procedures will be used. In addition, the most recent NCAA Constrained Theater
Requirement (CTR) pre-positioning objective for each theater will be used. For Supported/C-
MAJCOMs (USAFE, PACAF, and AFCENT) this is the CTR Starter Stock. For other
MAJCOMs this is the CTR for all theaters supported.
10.3. War Consumables Distribution Objective (WCDO).
   10.3.1. The WCDO is developed in LOGFAC where the Air Force WMP-4 resides. The
   NCAA interfaces with LOGFAC. LOGFAC distributes the NCAA theater requirement to
   operating bases and results are published on the unit WCDO. In addition to the information
   below, refer to the WCDO process outlined in AFI 25-101.
   10.3.2. For all WRM commodities, including munitions, the WCDO serves as the theater
   positioning objectives for each SRAN/DODAAC.
   10.3.3. The WCDO provides authorizations for starter stock munitions to support OPLAN
   execution.
   10.3.4. Operations, munitions, plans, and intelligence functions cooperate to produce the
   theater WCDO.
       10.3.4.1. The NCAA establishes munitions requirements. AF/A5RC provides NCAA
       theater requirement interface file to the LOGFAC SPO for inclusion into LOGFAC. The
       MAJCOM/C-NAF logistic planners in coordination with Operations distributes the
       NCAA Combined Theater Requirements (CTR) to build the theater WCDO.
       10.3.4.2. MAJCOM/C-NAF logistics planners produce and coordinate the WCDO prior
       to distribution to unit WRM managers and the MASO. The theater WCDO will match
       the NCAA CTR for the given theater.
   10.3.5. Munitions WRM distribution and realignment is performed through the GAP process
   IAW chapter 15.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                            215


10.4. WRM Munitions Financial Accounting.
   10.4.1. In addition to the below information, refer to AFI 25-101 for additional guidance and
   procedures.
   10.4.2. Until centralized WRM management is achieved MAJCOMs will interface with
   ACC as the designated Lead Command for WRM management IAW Program Action
   Directive 06-09 and 07-01. The MAJCOM A7 (Resources Division) manages and executes
   MAJCOM financial activity.
   10.4.3. The MAJCOM (including ARC) munitions staff (or equivalent) advises the
   MAJCOM A4 Resources Division on command/theater WRM munitions budget
   requirements.
   10.4.4. The MAJCOM Program Element Manager (PEM), in coordination with its FMB,
   distributes WRM funds to authorized base-level activities, monitors fund disbursement, and
   expenditure and recommends reprogramming actions.
   10.4.5. The MAJCOM PEM validates unit unfunded or unprogrammed requirements.
   10.4.6. The MAJCOM A4 munitions staff in coordination with the MAJCOM A7 and Lead
   Command advises units on submission of the PEC 28030 budget.
10.5. Planning Logistics Support.
   10.5.1. All US Air Force war or contingency plans must contain a logistics annex
   sufficiently detailed to enable personnel to support the planned operation immediately and
   efficiently. Lead MAJCOMs and C-NAFs develop the munitions appendix to this annex.
   10.5.2. Component services manage logistics support. Each service determines its
   requirements and budgets for necessary commodities. When produced, munitions and
   missiles become stock, owned by the individual service component.
   10.5.3. Unified commands are not responsible for logistics support of assigned forces.
   However, on execution of a unified OPLAN, the unified commander assumes directive
   authority over all components in the operating theater.
   10.5.4. The C-NAF will coordinate with the GACP and CAF/MAF Lead MAJCOMs (ACC
   and AMC) to plan logistics support requirements.
   10.5.5. MAJCOMs and CMAs (e.g., GACP) provide logistics support at and below wing- or
   base-level for assigned units.
   10.5.6. Where units are tenant, staging on or through, dispersing or operating from, or
   otherwise using installations assigned to other commands, the commander with jurisdiction
   over the installation provides logistics support as agreed between the involved MAJCOMS.
   10.5.7. Tenants coordinate support requirements with hosts before publishing any plan that
   commits host resources.
   10.5.8. OCONUS Supported/C-MAJCOMs (i.e., USAFE, PACAF, and AFCENT) in
   coordination with the appropriate C-NAF develop plans to receive and support augmenting
   forces. They provide all requirements for planned enroute and beddown locations to facilitate
   reception and support planning.
 216                                                 AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


   10.5.9. C-NAFs help unified commands assess reserve stocks of involved allies to identify
   potential US Air Force support requirements.
   10.5.10. Lead MAJCOMs and C-NAFs assist AFRC and ANG gained units to compute
   requirements, store and preposition materiel, and prepare for activation and deployment, as
   appropriate.
   10.5.11. HQ ACC, HQ AMC, and HQ AFSOC advise OCONUS Supported MAJCOMs of
   additional logistics support required for operations in the overseas area to ensure enough
   storage and maintenance capability. The GACP and C-NAFs coordinate with storing
   commands before acting to preposition any materiel or changing pre-positioning in WMP-4
   which would increase the consumable storage requirements.
   10.5.12. The SMCA operates IAW DOD 5160.65 and DODI 5160.68 and plays a major role
   in the munitions re-supply of USAF units. A significant amount of USAF munitions are
   stored in CONUS Army depots. The GACP maintains oversight and surveillance of Air
   Force munitions stored in CONUS depot stock.
10.6. Logistics Planning for Munitions Movement.
   10.6.1. When unable to store WRM munitions at or near the employment base, C-NAFs in
   coordination with C-MAJCOM and GACP may position munitions in central storage areas,
   theater storage facilities, or at other operational bases. In these cases, the C-NAF develops
   detailed plans and establishes memorandums of understanding (MOU) as necessary to
   facilitate movement of stocks when they are needed at wartime operating locations.
   10.6.2. OPLANs may direct combat aircraft to deploy with munitions aboard; for example,
   air-to-air missiles, 20mm or 30mm, chaff and flares. C-NAFs identify and reflect these type
   movement requirements in MAJCOM or theater OPLANs and logistics movement plans.
   Execution of the OPLAN activates this phase of munitions relocation.
   10.6.3. The C-NAF and GACP optimize pre-positioning at planned operating bases given
   sortie production requirements, threat and storage and transportation capabilities.
   10.6.4. The C-NAF and the GACP track munitions requirements and distribution. They
   initiate munitions movements not already covered by tactical movement. The C-NAF
   TACP/RACP serve as consolidated command points of contact with inter-theater and intra-
   theater support organizations.
10.7. MAJCOM Command Overflow.
   10.7.1. The C-NAFs and CAF, MAF, and SOF Lead MAJCOMs (ACC, AMC, and AFSOC)
   must identify to GACP how much of each unit's WRM munitions requirement come from
   CONUS stocks or production.
   10.7.2. Once C-NAFs and Lead MAJCOMs determine these shortfalls, they submit them to
   784 CBSG for sourcing.
   10.7.3. 784 CBSG (GACP) will:
       10.7.3.1. Source theater shortfall requirements, assures TPFDD transportation support,
       and publishes an approved USAF support plan for each MAJCOM/theater OPLAN.
       Redistribution or realignment of AFRC or ANG assets will be coordinated with HQ
       AFRC or NGB.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                            217


      10.7.3.2. Coordinate support plans with the affected MAJCOM s/C-NAFs.
      10.7.3.3. Satisfy the planned requirements of the MAJCOM/C-NAF as far as possible,
      including worldwide redistribution and asset realignment, and delivery of substitute
      munitions when preferred assets are not available.
      10.7.3.4. Ensure command overflow shipments reflect the following:
          10.7.3.4.1. Receiving SRAN/DODAAC.
          10.7.3.4.2. Shipping SRAN/DODAAC (when possible).
          10.7.3.4.3. Sequence of execution.
          10.7.3.4.4. Required Delivery Date (RDD).
          10.7.3.4.5. Port of Embarkation (POE).
          10.7.3.4.6. Port of Debarkation (POD).
          10.7.3.4.7. Type of movement.(air, surface, unit move or deployment)
      10.7.3.5. Develop support plans based on approved time-phased requirements. These
      requirements come from the Wartime Aircraft Activity (WAA) file approved for the
      planned year. Include outload and receipt capacity of break bulk/CADS points, ports,
      and receiving units in support plans to ensure all the munitions that are scheduled to
      arrive within a specified time period can be off-loaded and stored for use.
   10.7.4. All executing activities maintain plans with changes as they occur. They must
   ensure current and executable information is available to the SMCA, GACP, C-NAFs, and
   shipping and receiving units. For example, when a C-NAF (TACP/RACP) calls forward an
   item into the operational theater, the executing activity accordingly reduces the command
   overflow.
10.8. Munitions Call-forward.
   10.8.1. GACP: Coordinates requisitions with the U.S. Army Joint Munitions Command
   (JMC) to meet MAJCOM RDDs.
   10.8.2. JMC in-turn will submit the requisition to SMCA, SDDC and MSC as required for
   movement to meet RDD.
10.9. Standard Air Munitions Packages (STAMP).
   10.9.1. STAMP enables pre-selected or notional tasked tactical air units to deploy rapidly
   and operate from locations without prepositioned munitions or until sustained re-supply lines
   can be established. STAMP assets may also be tasked for surface movement (truck, rail, or
   vessel) to meet planned sustaining requirements when logistics lead-times allow such
   activity. Sortie rates, aircraft configurations, and logistics planning lead-time dictate the
   period of support from STAMP. See paragraph 11.2 for sourcing procedures.
   10.9.2. In addition to STAMP, theaters may request and establish TARP programs within the
   operational theater to realign theater stocks in the early stages of a contingency. TARPs are
   designed and set-up primarily as air-cargo movement assets, however, may move by surface
   modes when logistics lead-times allow.

   10.9.3. The USAF has configured APF vessels to provide component commanders greater
   deployment flexibility by reducing early swing-stock requirements supported by airlift. APF
   allows strategic swing-stock munitions to move rapidly from one region to another as
   priorities or circumstances dictate. See paragraph 11.2 for sourcing procedures.
10.10. War Reserve Stocks for Allies (WRSA).
   10.10.1. WRSA comprises US military service-owned stocks intended for use in
   emergencies only to make up for shortfalls in allied ATOs. Higher headquarters must
   approve release of WRSA to allies during peacetime.
   10.10.2. Agencies controlling WRSA and MOU stocks use these guidelines when
   developing joint operating instructions with allied nations.
   10.10.3. Manage WRSA assets on a separate SRAN, because item prices are constrained to
   the item's original acquisition cost or the approved negotiated WRSA price.
       10.10.3.1. Manage the WRSA inventory as other Air Force WRM munitions.
       10.10.3.2. Apply the same security measures to WRSA authorizations, levels, quantities
       and other parameters as you would to WRM.
       10.10.3.3. Keep WRSA at authorized and approved levels.
       10.10.3.4. Identify shortfalls to the C-NAF, C-MAJCOM, and GACP for resolution.
       10.10.3.5. WRSA stock will be segregated from the USAF stockpile whenever storage
       space is available. If munitions must be commingled, WRSA stock will be appropriately
       identified.
       10.10.3.6. Never use WRSA assets to satisfy other requirements (RDO, training, etc.)
       without C-NAF and GACP approval. Report to the owning C-NAF/MAJCOM any
       action initiated at the local-level that changes the identity or serviceability of WRSA
       assets.
       10.10.3.7. When the GACP directs the TACP/RACP to release WRSA stocks, the
       TACP/RACP may transfer assets either in-mass to the allied user or selectively based on
       allied ATO shortfalls. Restrictions on release of WRSA items are as follows:
          10.10.3.7.1. Do not release munitions excluded by C-NAF/GACP (such as air
          intercept missiles) without AF/A4LW and AF/A5RC approval.
          10.10.3.7.2. Do not exceed dollar value (congressional authority) assigned to the
          WRSA.
          10.10.3.7.3. Stop releasing WRSA assets when you reach the assigned dollar value.
          Obtain release authority and process additional requirements through FMS IAW
          paragraph 9.6.
       10.10.3.8. When WRSA release notification is received from the appropriate authority,
       assets can be either transferred in-mass or selectively based on allied ATO shortfalls.
       10.10.3.9. Apply the MOA or other authorizing document between the US Government
       and the allied country when selling assets designated as WRSA in a military emergency.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                         219


     10.10.3.10. Proper authority may direct munitions accounts to release munitions other
     than WRSA under a follow-on MOU to support allied shortfalls.
     10.10.3.11. Release or Transfer Procedures. On receiving a RDO for WRSA or MOU
     release, affected bases prepare two sets of DD Form 1348-1-4PT IAW AFMAN 23-110,
     Volume 9, Chapter 7, Preparation and Processing of Foreign Military Sales (FMS)
     Cases for all FMS transactions. Bases complete both sets reflecting data required in
     columns 1 through 80, item nomenclature (in block X), and weight and cube. Include the
     dollar amount of individual items and total costs. Distribute documents as follows:

                                           Chapter 11

                        MUNITIONS CONTINGENCY SOURCING

11.1. Purpose. This chapter outlines contingency munitions sourcing for Air Force activities
and establishes a standard munitions report. The Munitions reporting process will provide the
CJCS, Combatant Commanders, and Air Force activities the ability to monitor critical munitions
items, affecting warfighting capabilities during contingencies, emergencies, or exercises. In
addition, the reported information will be used in support of Joint Materiel Priorities and
Allocation Board (JMPAB) deliberations. AF/A4LW and AF/A5RC represent the USAF on the
Munitions JMPAB.
11.2. Contingency Munitions Sourcing Process. The munitions allocation process described
in paragraph 14.3 is a peacetime pre-positioning process. Once contingency sourcing begins, all
munitions balances are available to support contingency operations. All expenditures will be
against current operations for the contingency being supported (see paragraph 7.6.3. for WRM
aircraft munitions expenditure procedures). When contingency operations require the use of
munitions assets not available in the operational theater, AF/A5RC approves sourcing requests to
meet operational requirements, STAMP/STRAPP, and for munitions assets in short supply. The
following process outlines contingency munitions requests:
   11.2.1. The Lead Command/C-NAF (TACP/RACP) will identify and request additional
   munitions needed to support contingency operations for sourcing. Send requests to the
   GACP (784 CBSG) operations center, via official SIPRNET e-mail or secure fax (as
   appropriate) with informational copies to AF/A4LW and AF/A5RC. Provide the following:
       11.2.1.1. Type of munitions/munitions components required by NSN.
       11.2.1.2. Quantity required.
       11.2.1.3. Ship to Location/SRAN/DODAAC.
       11.2.1.4. Required in-place date.
   11.2.2. The GACP will:
       11.2.2.1. Forward requests for Air Superiority Missiles (AIM-9, AIM-120, AGM-88, or
       ADM-160B) to the 782 CBSG. The 782 CBSG will coordinate sourcing IAW the TAMP.
       11.2.2.2. Identify possible sources to meet theater requirements identified in paragraph
       11.2.3.
       11.2.2.3. Make a recommendation to AF/A4LW on preferred source. AF/A5RC will
       approve all movements of assets in short supply.
   11.2.3. AF/A4LW will approve requests for munitions available in the Air Force stockpile.
   11.2.4. The GACP or TMCP will notify requesting C-NAF (TACP/RACP) and AF/A5RC
   and AF/A4LW of availability and approval/disapproval for TPFDD action as required.
   11.2.5. The USAF Global Ammunition Control Point (GACP) is the Air Force POC for all
   contingency munitions sourcing and requests.
       11.2.5.1. Munitions Contingency Sourcing and Reporting Procedures.
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                          221


        11.2.5.1.1. When an C-MAJCOM, MAJCOM, or NAF is involved in contingency
        operations that require the use of munitions assets not available in their theater of
        operations, the following process applies:
        11.2.5.1.2. For all APF and STAMP/STRAPP munitions requests, follow procedures
        in paragraph 11.2.1.
        11.2.5.1.3. For all other munitions sourcing requests to support contingencies, C-
        MAJCOM, MAJCOMs, and C-NAFs submit requests to the GACP crisis action team,
        via official SIPRNET e-mail: gacp@hill.af.smil.mil or secure phone DSN: 777-2666
        and provide the following information:
           11.2.5.1.3.1. Type of munitions or components required by NSN, quantity
           required, ship-to location or SRAN (DODAAC); and required in-place date.
           11.2.5.1.3.2. The GACP will forward Air Superiority Missile (AIM-9, AIM-120,
           AGM-88, or ADM-160B) requests to the Air Superiority Support Cell at 782
           CBSG to coordinate sourcing IAW the TAMP, identify sources to satisfy
           contingency requests, and make recommendations to AF/A5RC on preferred
           sources, if available, within the Air Force stockpile.
        11.2.5.1.4. Munitions Contingency Reporting Procedures: AF/A4LW or AF/A5RC
        will direct when Munitions Reports (MUREP) are submitted. C-MAJCOMs and
        NAFs may implement this report to support a theater contingency, exercise, or
        training. All units will submit the MUREP to their C-MAJCOM, MAJCOM, and
        NAF as appropriate who will consolidate reports and forward to the GACP. Reports
        will address the status of all theater assigned munitions within their operational
        control to include APF assigned assets. GACP will consolidate reports and forward
        to AF/A4LW and AF/A5RC.
        11.2.5.1.5. MUREP Reporting Timelines and Suspense: The report cutoff time will
        be daily as of 2400Z (Zulu Time) with a transmission time NLT 0300Z the following
        day to the C-MAJCOM, MAJCOM, and NAF. Consolidated reports (with attached
        supporting spreadsheets) are due to GACP NLT 0900Z daily. GACP will forward
        consolidated Air Force reports to AF/A4LW and AF/A5RC NLT 1500Z daily or as
        directed. Reports will be numbered sequentially and will cover the 24-hours
        immediately preceding the cutoff time.
        11.2.5.1.6. Report Transfer: MUREP reports will be classified SECRET. The
        MAJCOM and NAF reports will be submitted to the GACP via official classified e-
        mail via the SIPRNET to the GACP: gacp@hill.af.smil.mil. If classified e-mail is
        not available, submit reports via secure fax or secure telephone to DSN: 777-2666 by
        line item. The format for the MUREP is an excel spreadsheet.
        11.2.5.1.7. Specific MUREP Reporting Instructions:
           11.2.5.1.7.1. Items to be reported will be identified at implementation. Items will
           be reported by:
               11.2.5.1.7.1.1. Department of Defense Identification Code (DODIC) or
               Complete Round Code (CRC) as required.
               11.2.5.1.7.1.2. Report all combat-usable CR capable assets (including all
222                                             AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010

            AF/A5RC.
            11.2.5.1.7.1.3. Items that are reported by CRC will use priority build
            reporting (identify priority build in Part II).
            11.2.5.1.7.1.4. On-hand quantities will be reported as the assets arrive
            regardless of location or off-load status (to include APF munitions). All
            munitions data will be recorded as each (EA).
            11.2.5.1.7.1.5. War Reserve Stock for Allies (WRSA) assets will be reported
            as separate line entries.

       MUNITIONS INFORMATION SYSTEMS (MIS) PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

13.1. Munitions Information Systems (MIS) Requirement Process.
   13.1.1. The MIS requirements process involves all centrally managed information systems
   used by the munitions communities to include: CAS, TMRS, IMDS/G081/CAMS, and
   Automated Identification Technologies (AIT).
   13.1.2. AF/A4LW will advocate for validated MIS requirements.
        13.1.2.1. Successful advocacy of MIS requirements requires adequate preparation,
        presentation, planning and programming actions before presentation of initiatives to the
        A4 Requirements Board (A4RB) for prioritization, approval, and funding.
   13.1.3. The MIS requirements process provides a means to:
        13.1.3.1. Enable AF/A4LW and Lead MAJCOMs to bring Information Technology (IT)
        requirements forward as potential standard solutions for USAF prioritization, approval,
        and funding. Lead Commands request input on IT requirements and potential solutions
        from Supported Commands prior to presenting new requirements to AF/A4LW.
        13.1.3.2. Improve cross-flow of information on IT solutions currently in use, test, or
        development.
        13.1.3.3. Share information and standardize capabilities and solutions to reduce
        duplication of effort and waste of resources resulting from developing IT solutions that
        already exist or are in development elsewhere. The EAF concept requires standard
        solutions that are interoperable between organizations, MAJCOMs, and the Air Force.
        13.1.3.4. Develop fielding plans for IT solutions recommended for USAF wide
        implementation (to include training and funding requirements).
        13.1.3.5. Establishment of work priorities for 754 ELSG CAS PMO and approves
        software configuration changes to CAS.
   13.1.4. All IT requirements must be staffed, coordinated, approved, and funded by the
   AF/A4I, Directorate of Transformation.
        13.1.4.2. AF/A4LW is the munitions conduit to AF/A4I. Munitions IT requirements will
        be coordinated and staffed through the Lead MAJCOM to AF/A4LW. AF/A4LW will
        present all initiatives to AF/A4I.
   13.1.4. 3 Any MIS or IT solution presented for Air Force approval must be sponsored by a
   Lead MAJCOM or AF/A4LW to be put forward to AF/A4I.
        13.1.4.4. All submissions for new MIS or IT requirements, concepts, or solutions must
        demonstrate a valid need supported by metrics or test data to support the proposal.
           13.1.4.4.1. Presenters should be prepared to answer the following questions, at a
           minimum:
               13.1.4.4.1.1. Does a requirement exist for this initiative?
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                             231


              13.1.4.4.1.2. Does a similar solution already exist?
              13.1.4.4.1.3. What are the estimated costs to implement the solution?
              13.1.4.4.1.4. Are developmental funding costs being requested?
              13.1.4.4.1.5. What are the benefits to the USAF?
              13.1.4.4.1.6. Is the proposed/identified solution proprietary?
       13.1.4.5. 754 ELSG/ILMW will develop and present results of any technical evaluations
       they perform on recommended CAS solutions to ensure they are compliant with system
       architecture, security, safety, and interoperability standards.
   13.1.5. Responsibilities.
       13.1.5.1. AF/A4LW will:
          13.1.5.1.1. Make final decisions on recommended priorities to AF/A4I for CAS
          requirements.
          13.1.5.1.2. Submit MIS requirements to the AF/A4I Portfolio Manager for
          competition, prioritization, approval, and documentation in the Expectation
          Management Agreement.
       13.1.5.2. 754 ELSG/ILMW will: Perform cost estimation, technical evaluation, and
       implementation review for submitted CAS requirements.
13.2. CAS System Management Procedures. Functional System Administrator (SA)
responsibilities to support the CAS application software residing on the Global Combat Support
System-Air Force Integrated Framework (GCSS-AFF) are described below. The Air Force
authorizes access levels to empower the lowest management levels, minimize functional and
MAJCOM involvement, simplify administration tasks, and decentralize execution, to implement
enterprise standards. These procedures clarify separation of duties required by personnel
supporting the three-tier level (PMO/MAJCOM/Base) CAS application software residing on the
Air Force Portal.
   13.2.1. The CAS Program Management Office (PMO) is located at 754th ELSG and is
   responsible for the overall functional administration of the CAS application software residing
   on the GCSS-AF Integrated Framework. 754th ELSG/ILMW will appoint functional system
   administrators (FSA) in writing; appointed FSAs will grant CAS Admin and Users privileges
   to authorized CAS users via the GCSS-AF IF. The memorandum of appointment will be
   validated annually. 754th ELSG/ILMW will submit a memorandum to HQ GCSS-AF
   requesting the listed personnel be granted the CAS_ADMIN role, which in turn enables the
   CAS SPO the ability to grant or delete privileges to appointed MAJCOM and base level SAs.
   13.2.2. CAS Functional Overview. CAS supports USAF combat and support units, GACP
   (784 CBSG and 782 CBSG TMCP), AFCOMAC, and various munitions training centers.
   The objective of CAS is to improve Air Force combat and logistics capabilities by providing
   effective munitions management and accountability at each level of combat execution from
   the unit to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   13.2.3. Contingencies and Alternate States/Modes of Operation. By design, there is no
   ‗degraded or alternate mode‘ of CAS System operation. Automated processing requires a
232                                                   AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


  fully operational connectivity to the Internet. The primary mode of operation in the absence
  of Internet connectivity or computer support is through manual post-post procedures
  identified in attachment 3, Off-line Processing (Post-Post).
  13.2.4. Security. The data and information handled by the CAS application operates at the
  unclassified sensitive level, For Official Use Only (FOUO).
  13.2.5. Automatic Information Technology (AIT). CAS is tasked to identify and implement
  approved automatic information technologies to improve munitions data collection and
  streamline munitions maintenance processes. These processes includes but not limited to the
  user of labeling and scanning of bar-codes, use of Radio Frequency Identification and mobile
  devices to provide data collection at the points of maintenance as event occur to improve data
  reliability and timeliness.
      13.2.5.1. CAS AIT software will utilize with the Air Force Enterprise Data Collection to
      standardize data collection and reuse of data across the Logistic community.
      Applications on mobile device will be tailored to improve processes while providing
      CAS the necessary information to create accountable the auditable transactions based on
      USERID and user permissions.
      13.2.5.2. AIT software will provide users response from CAS for each transaction
      process providing either a success message or movement error generated by CAS system
      edit for storage conditions (i.e., NEW, CIIC, compatibility). User will be notified if other
      conditions exist that prevent the transaction from process correctly in CAS and these
      transaction will be captured in CAS AIT Conflict Resolution (AMP09A) program to allow
      user the correct the errors by editing the transaction or deleting the transaction.
  13.2.6. System Performance. Although numerous techniques exist for system performance
  measurement, throughput is of considerable importance to a user. The CAS processing
  environment permits application processing in an on-line, interactive mode with scheduled
  batch processes executing in background mode. Actual throughput is dependent upon the
  execution mode mix (for example, the volume, execution request types, and number of users
  signed on) at any point in time. Large file downloads should be run during end-of-day
  processing. Users need to be mindful that end-of-day processing in one time zone may
  impact users in different time zones.

  MUNITIONS REQUIREMENTS, ALLOCATIONS AND BUY-BUDGET PROCESS

14.1. Conventional Munitions Requirements. Munitions requirements are determined using
the guidance prescribed in DODI 3000.4. The annual process to determine requirements is led
by AF/A5RC. The process depicted in Figure 14.1, Air Force Conventional Munitions
Requirements Process produces a five-year munitions forecast that is the primary vehicle to
request and allocate air-to-ground and ground munitions required for test, training, and
operational needs. The most current allocation CAT Code and Requirements Codes can be
located on the 784 CBSG web site under ‗News and Info‘ when developing forecasts and
submitting OOCR.
   14.1.1. Munitions Working Group (MWG). The purpose of the MWG is to educate the
   munitions requirements stakeholders on the process, update stakeholders on current
   munitions status, ensure accurate munitions and weapons effects data are utilized in analysis,
   and understand relevant changes to theater operations plans. Topics will include:
       14.1.1.1. Briefings on munitions in production/development, focused on employment
       issues and the operational impact of logistics supportability.
       14.1.1.2. Weapons System Evaluation Program (WSEP) reviews.
       14.1.1.3. Theater employment and HQ USAF activities, process improvements, lessons
       learned, and action items pertaining to GAP, requirements, and stockpile allocations. 784
       CBSG provides an overview of the previous year‘s GAP and major changes to
       forecasting procedures.
   14.1.2. Theater Working Group (TWG) meetings. The TWG meetings are an extension of
   the MWG during which AF/A5RC NCAA branch visits C-NAFs as dictated by National
   Defense Strategy, Guidance for the Development of the Force (GDF), and MRP
   Implementation Guidance to refine munitions employment and utilization. The respective
   theater hosts the TWG meeting ensuring appropriate participation of theater warfighters.
   Representatives from operations, intelligence, plans and logistics shall attend these meetings
   to provide theater inputs and assumptions for the NCAA development process. These inputs
   and assumptions are then used to define each theater‘s WRM and training requirements and
   expenditure per sortie factor (EPSF) rates.
   14.1.3. Tactical Air Missile Program (TAMP) and Product Improvement Working Group
   (PIWG). The annual TAMP PIWG is an AF/A5RC sponsored, WR-ALC hosted event.
       14.1.3.1. The purpose of the TAMP/PIWG is to serve as a discussion forum and to make
       positioning decisions for existing air superiority missiles (e.g., AIM-9, AIM-120 and
       AGM-88).
       14.1.3.2. Agenda topics include: Briefings on air superiority munitions program and
       beddown updates, projected inventory status, test and evaluation requirements, WSEP
       status, CATM requirements, and allocation and requirements methodology.
14.2. Munitions Requirements Forecast Process. The munitions forecast is an annual process
to identify munitions requirements in Categories A, B, C, D, E, F, N, and T. The annual PCAR
 234                                              AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


forecast memorandum published by 784 CBSG provides specific procedures and CAT Code
definitions. The overall process is described in the following paragraphs:
   14.2.1. Munitions requirements are derived from AFI 11-212, Munitions Requirements for
   Aircrew Training; AFCAT 21-209 Volume 1, Ground Munitions and Volume 2, Demolition
   Munitions; the Air Force Standard for Non-Expendable Air Munitions Training
   Authorizations; the UCML; test plans; expenditure history; bed-down plans; and the PCAR
   forecast memorandum from 784 CBSG. Munitions requirements categories are defined in
   the annual PCAR memorandum.

  validate munitions requirements and develop the consolidated forecast according to
  paragraph 9.7.
  14.2.4. Forecasting and Managing CAT Code B (non-NCAA WRM) Allocations. CAT
  Code B, Miscellaneous munitions authorizations are forecasted and allocated against
  requirement code BP using AFCAT 21-209 Volume 1. Approved allocations are distributed
  according to Table 14.1 and the following:
     14.2.4.1. 100-percent of the OCONUS base-allocated quantity will be the OCONUS
     theater positioning objective. OCONUS units requisition shortages necessary to satisfy
     the entire allocation.
     14.2.4.2. 30-percent of the CONUS base-allocated quantity will be the CONUS base
     positioning objective. CONUS units, including ARC units, will only requisition
     shortages to position a maximum of 30-percent of the AMST allocated quantity at base-
     level. The MASO may submit ATRs to allocate the next higher QUP for each CONUS
     base mobility account. For example: A unit authorized 90 each 9mm rounds per
     AFCAT 21-209 is allocated 27 each 9mm rounds (i.e., 90 x .30 = 27 rounds). An ATR
     increases the allocation to 30 each allowing tasked personnel to travel with 2 full clips (2
     clips x 15ea rounds = 30 rounds).
     14.2.4.3. 45-percent of the total CONUS base-allocated quantity will be distributed
     among the OCONUS commands (15-percent each) as an OCONUS theater pre-
     positioning objective. CONUS units, including ARC units, will not requisition these
     quantities.
        14.2.4.3.1. 15-percent of the CONUS base-allocated quantity will be the OCONUS
        theater pre-positioning objective for each OCONUS command (PACAF, USAFE, and
        AFCENT). OCONUS commands will identify theater pre-positioning locations, by
        SRAN/DODAAC, and ensure the designated units requisition quantities necessary to
        satisfy the allocated pre-positioning quantity.
        14.2.4.3.2. If OCONUS commands cannot store CONUS pre-positioned assets at the
        intended base, the OCONUS command positions assets in-theater at a location that
        can support logistics movement.
        14.2.4.3.3. OCONUS commands ensure quantities in excess to OCONUS allocation
        are applied to the CONUS pre-positioned allocation before requisitioning. Only
        requisition pre-positioning quantities when existing assets do not satisfy the total
        OCONUS and CONUS pre-positioned allocation.
     14.2.4.4. 25-percent of the total CONUS allocated quantity will be the STAMP
     positioning objective. CONUS units, including ARC units, will not requisition these
     quantities.

working group is used to match limited worldwide inventory against validated requirements
(derived from the requirements working group). Munitions beddown plans are validated against
asset allocations and necessary adjustments are made. The following should be considered:
Substitute munitions and items when the primary munitions are unavailable (while substitutes
may satisfy one or more functions, it might not necessarily perform satisfactorily in all
instances); issues that impact EAF, the ANG, AFRC and training; and available infrastructure;
new or revised mission changes including BRAC announcements.
   14.3.1. 784 CBSG will release an Air Staff coordinated agenda for the allocation working
   group. Air Staff will provide the parameters for stockpile optimization for inclusion with the
   agenda.
       14.3.1.1. Ten duty days before the allocation working group, the 784 CBSG will provide

                                          Chapter 15

                          GLOBAL ASSET POSITIONING (GAP)

15.1. Program Scope. GAP integrates five munitions WRM positioning programs to meet
anticipated demands on time and resources. These provide theater commanders with their initial
starter stocks, provide rapid swing stock response capability with the APF and STAMP/STRAPP
and provides for operational swing-stock positioning by theaters and CONUS.
15.2. The Global Asset Positioning (GAP) Working Group: AF/A4LW sponsors and 784
CBSG hosts activity of the GAP working group and establishes positioning goals and objectives
for the Air Force, resolves issues of mutual concern and develops a munitions positioning
strategy for near- and mid-term munitions components for WRM, test, and training.
   15.2.1. System program office (SPO) participation is critical to acquisition support of GAP
   decisions. Production quantities and delivery dates must be published to AF/A5RC, Lead
   Command, 784 CBSG and 782 CBSG as necessary.
   15.2.2. This process identifies the following FY mandatory munitions movements. The
   annual MMP is produced as a result of decisions made by the GAP working group.
   Additionally, the working group validates beddown plans against movements and makes
   adjustments as necessary. The following are considered: APF, STAMP, Operational in-place
   theater stocks, CONUS stocks, test and training, delivery schedules of additional assets
   (legacy and new).
   15.2.3. Any deviation from the MMP requires a coordinated C-NAF/A4 and MAJCOM/A5
   request submitted through their unified command J3 & J4 to the Joint Staff J-3/J-4. Joint
   Staff J-3/J-4 will staff the deviation with AF/A4 and AF/A5 for approval. Joint Staff J-3/J-4
   will return the coordinated approval/response to the applicable MAJCOM/C-NAF.
   15.2.4. The 784 CBSG will consolidate, publish and track action items and lessons learned
   from each cycle. They will in turn provide status and related information to participants
   throughout the year and prior to the start of each working group.
15.3. Afloat Prepositioned Fleet (APF) Management.
   15.3.1. General: The USAF APF stores forward-based munitions cargo in support of
   combatant commanders.
       15.3.1.1. APF prepositioning provides significantly greater deployment flexibility by
       reducing early lift requirements and allows for the rapid movement of critical munitions
       assets ‗swing-stocks‘ from one region to another based on National Command Authority
       (NCA) priorities as circumstances dictate.
       15.3.1.2. The APF is manned and maintained by civilian mariner crews. Vessels require
       permissive off loading with adequate terminal and port facilities, either afloat or ashore,
       to discharge explosive cargo. Supported MAJCOMs and C-NAFs must ensure host
       nation support to expedite cargo operations, minimize port congestion, and move the
       forward echelon out of the seaports.
   15.3.2. APF Contingency Discharge Operations:
240                                                  AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


      15.3.2.1. When an APF vessel is planned for contingency discharge and is apportioned to
      a theater, the APF Management Team will transfer APF assets to the respective C-NAF
      SRAN. The C-NAF A4 munitions staff will process shipments in CAS to the ultimate
      consignee SRAN for each APF container planned for discharge.
      15.3.2.2. Prior to commencing discharge operations, the theater C-NAF must provide the
      APF Management Team with a theater distribution plan identifying the ultimate
      consignee SRAN for each APF munitions container to be discharged.
      15.3.2.3. The APF Management Team will deploy a Port Management Team(s) to the
      planned Sea Port of Debarkation (SPOD) to manage munitions offload sequence and
      priorities and ‗burn‘ Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags with the ultimate
      consignee data and affix RFID tags to containers.
      15.3.2.4. After theater APF discharge and distribution operations are complete, the APF
      Management Team and the C-NAF A4 munitions staff will reconcile assets remaining on
      the C-NAF SRAN by matching those remaining on the APF vessel. Once reconciled, the
      APF Management Team in coordination with the C-NAF will transfer APF assets back to
      the APF vessel SRAN.
  15.3.3. APF Peacetime Discharge Operations:
      15.3.3.1. APF vessels may be planned for peacetime discharge to reposition specific
      munitions assets ashore in one or more theaters. During peacetime APF assets are not
      apportioned to the effected theater and the APF management team ships specific assets to
      the ultimate consignee DODAAC.
      15.3.3.2. Peacetime discharge of selected APF assets is done only after coordination with
      AF/A4LW, AF/A5RC, and the effected theater logistics/munitions planners.
      15.3.3.3. The APF management team may be tasked to deploy a Port Management
      Team(s) to coordinate munitions discharge and reconcile assets remaining on the APF
      vessel.
  15.3.4. APF Apportionment.
      15.3.4.1. During peacetime, apportioned APF assets are under the operational control of
      the Theater Commander in whose area of responsibility the ships are located.
      15.3.4.2. For contingency and crisis action planning, the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan
      (JSCP) apportions the APF as forces. As apportioned in the JSCP, one or more vessels
      may be tasked in OPLAN Time-Phased Force and Deployment Lists (TPFDL).
         15.3.4.2.1. Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD) research must
         consider ship stowage plans, port unloading times, and the time to move assets from
         one theater to another. Also consider assets available through other means such as
         CONUS or forward-based swing stocks, and STAMP/ STRAPP. Approximate fleet-
         sail-times can be obtained from the APF Management Team (784 CBSG) or APF
         Battlebooks.
         15.3.4.2.2. The unified command‘s air component submits TPFDD requirements to
         the theater commander. The theater commander validates the requirements during the
         execution-planning phase for later entry into the theater commander‘s validated
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                        241


         TPFDD. Deployment planning should allow for flexibility as the preplanned
         priorities sometime change in execution.
         15.3.4.2.3. During execution, actual commitment of the APF to theater commanders
         will be IAW Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) established priorities. Once the vessel is
         chopped to the theater commander, he or she decides how to best utilize the afloat
         assets by determining the offload strategy to meet mission needs. Theater
         commanders may address requests for reallocation of assets to the CJCS to be
         handled through the Joint Materiel Priorities and Allocations Board (JMPAB). Final
         authority to divert APF vessels requires NCA approval. The JMPAB decides user
         priority if more than one OPLAN is executed simultaneously.
  15.3.5. APF Program Responsibilities:

          15.4.4.6.4. Ensure they possess access to a GCCS telnet terminal and train personnel
          on its use.
15.5. Theater-Prepositioned and CONUS-Stored Assets. Theater prepositioned assets,
although an integral part of GAP, are managed by owning theater commanders in consideration
of applicable Air Force positioning guidance. CONUS stored assets can be in any one of three
categories:
   15.5.1. Retail stocks assigned to CONUS base accounts.
   15.5.2. Retail stocks at AFMC depots or facilities (i.e., STAMP).
   15.5.3. Wholesale stocks at Army ammunition plants and depots. The SMCA manages these
   Army depots. Most Air Force CONUS-stored assets are at these SMCA-managed locations.
15.6. Munitions Transportation Funding, PACER AMMO. PACER AMMO is the official
DOD nickname for the centralized funding process identifying the transportation requirements to
meet MAJCOM munitions positioning objectives.
   15.6.1. HQ AFMC/A4MW coordinates with the MAJCOM (CONUS) and C-NAF
   (OCONUS) munitions staffs and is responsible for monitoring and tracking the transportation
   funding process for all USAF munitions movements. This includes CONUS PHIT, and
   OCONUS sea and air costs. OCONUS PHIT surface (truck/rail) movements are not paid by
   PACER AMMO project codes.
15.6.2. The NCAA provides munitions requirements while the TAMP and DLAR provide
allocations and positioning objectiv
       15.6.2.1. MAJCOMs (CONUS) and C-NAFs (OCONUS) determine which munitions to
       request for call forward and retrograde based on their allocations and theater operational
       plans.
246                                                 AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


      15.6.2.2. Positioning objectives are determined by the TAMP and GAP working groups
      based on MAJCOM (CONUS) and C-NAF (OCONUS) desires and Air Force objectives
      as determined by Air Staff.
      15.6.2.3. The MMP developed during the GAP working group will provide the basis for
      forecasting and allocating SDT funding to move munitions.
      15.6.2.4. Each of the moves in the MMP not categorized as a ‗Must Pay‘ will be
      prioritized by the GAP steering committee, co-chaired by AF/A4LW and AF/A5RC.
  15.6.4. The MAJCOMs, C-NAFs, AFRC, NGB and GACP must be active participants in the
  PACER AMMO process and the GACP or AF/A4LW must make final movement
  determinations.
      15.6.4.1. Transportation funding requirements must be identified and resources allocated
      to support munitions movements from point of origin to final destination within the
      CONUS and to the OCONUS port of entry.
      15.6.4.2. PACER AMMO will provide the focus to justify and advocate funding to
      preposition the worldwide munitions stockpile IAW the GAP and MMP.
      15.6.4.3. The MMP will be costed out by AFMC and used as the basis for the SDT
      requirement submission for munitions moves within the Air Force. When SDT funds are
      released, the MAJCOMs will be notified of approved MMP moves.
  15.6.5. The types of munitions movements, definitions, project codes and categories are in
  Table 7.4.
      15.6.5.1. Programmed movements are categorized as ‗Must Pay‘ or ‗Prioritized‘.
         15.6.5.1.1. ‗Must Pay‘ movements are mandatory and critical to the daily operations
         and are authorized when requisitioned.
         15.6.5.1.2. ‗Prioritized‘ moves are funded to the maximum extent possible within
         available resources.
      15.6.5.2. ‗Approval Required‘ category is for moves not identified at the GAP. These
      require AF/A5RC approval. Once approved, these movements fall into ‗must pay‘ or
      ‗prioritized‘ categories.
      15.6.5.3. The official project codes listed in Table 7.4 must be included on all shipment
      documents.

Terms:
Abbreviated WSN:—A truncated WSN consisting of the CRWC and the SN (excludes
SRAN/DODAAC). For example: BL2CM 001.
Air Tasking Order (ATO): A method used to task and disseminate to components, subordinate
units and command and control agencies projected sorties, capabilities and forces to targets and
specific missions. Normally provides specific instructions to include call signs, targets,
controlling agencies, etc., as well as general instructions.
Base Support Plan (BSP):—Superseded. See In Garrison Expeditionary Site Plan (IGESP) C-
Day: The unnamed day on which a deployment operation commences or is to commence. The
deployment may be movement of troops, cargo, weapon systems, or a combination of these
elements utilizing any or all types of transport. The letter ―C‖ will be the only one used to
denote the above. The highest command or headquarters responsible for coordinating the
planning will specify the exact meaning of C-day within the aforementioned definition. The
command or headquarters directly responsible for the execution of the operation, if other than the
one coordinating the planning, will do so in light of the meaning specified by the highest
command or headquarters coordinating the planning Capability Production Document (CPD): A
document that addresses the production elements specific to a single increment of an acquisition
program. The CPD must be validated and approved before a Milestone C decision review. The
refinement of performance attributes and Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) is the most
significant difference between the Capability Development Document (CDD) and CPD. The
CPD format is contained in CJCSM 3170.01B.
Centralized Management Activity (CMA):—Activities that comprise a workload that are
centrally located and performed by an organization to eliminate redundant capabilities across the
Air Force.
Chemical Warfare Material (CWM):—Items generally configured as a munitions containing a
chemical compound that is intended to kill, seriously injure, or incapacitate a person through its
physiological effects. CWM includes V and G-series nerve agents or H-series (mustard) and L-
series (lewisite) blister agents in other-than-munition configurations; and certain industrial
chemicals (e.g., Hydrogen Cyanide (AC), Cyanogen Chloride (CK), or Carbonyl Dichloride
(called phosgene or CG)) configured as a military munition. Due to their hazards, prevalence,
and military-unique application, chemical agent identification set (CAIS) are also considered
 266                                                    AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010


CWM. CWM does not include: riot control devices; chemical defoliants and herbicides;
industrial chemicals (e.g., AC, CK, or CG) not configured as a munition; smoke and other
obscuration producing items; flame and incendiary producing items; or soil, water, debris or
other media contaminated with low concentrations of chemical agents where no CA hazards
exist.
Collocated Operating Base (COB):—An active or reserve allied airfield designated for joint or
unilateral use by US Air Force wartime augmentation forces or for wartime relocation of US Air
Force in theater forces. COBs are not US bases. Combat Ammunition System (CAS): Air
Force‘s single system of record for the management of conventional munitions. Provide a global
view of assets under the physical control of the Air Force.
Complete Round Dictionary (CRD—): A listing of complete round weapon codes and the
associated components (by qty) necessary to assemble.
Complete Round Weapon Code (CRWC):— 5 Digit code utilized to generically identify
complete rounds. For example: BL2CM.
Component MAJCOM (C MAJCOM):— MAJCOMs that serve a component role. Air Force
Component Commander and staff that support the Combatant Commander at the strategic level.
The staff does not duplicate the functions of the Component NAF (C-NAF) Headquarters
AFFOR Staff.
Component Numbered Air Force (C NAF):— A NAF that serve a component role, either
subordinate to component or component NAF. The staff supports the Air Force Component
Commander at the operational and tactical level and is manned with a minimum core capability
to handle steady state operations and contingency scenarios.
Concept of Operations (CONOPS):—A verbal or graphic statement, in broad outline, of a
commander's assumptions or intent in regard to an operation or series of operations. The concept
of operations frequently is embodied in campaign plans and operation plans; in the latter case,
particularly when the plan covers a series of connected operations to be carried out
simultaneously or in succession. The concept is designed to give an overall picture of the
operation. It is included primarily for additional clarity of purpose. Frequently, it is referred to
as the commander's concept.
ContainerID:— An identification name assigned to a container managed in the Combat
Ammunition System‘s container management system
Contingency Operation Mobility Planning and Execution System (COM—PES): Computer
system designed to provide planners an automated capability to operate and maintain force
packages, to develop and task requirements for operations plans, and to manage contingency
forces and execution actions required of the operations, manpower, logistics, and personnel
functions.
Conventional Munitions:—A device charged with conventional explosives, propellants,
pyrotechnics, initiating composition or biological or chemical materiel for use in connection with
defense or offense, including demolition. Certain conventional munitions can be used for
training, ceremonial, or non-operational purposes. Conventional munitions include all explosive
and non-explosive components essential for the assembly of a complete operational round of
munitions or AUR tactical missile. Additionally, items which in themselves are considered
AFI21-201_35FWSUP_I 14 JUNE 2010                                                               267


complete operational rounds, plus any other items designated for munitions management or
reporting. In general, conventional munitions include toxic, nontoxic, biological, incendiary
explosives, smoke agents, bombs, chemical spray tanks, warheads, rockets, explosive
components of catapult and canopy remover devices, explosive demolition materials, grenades,
mines, pyrotechnics, and all types of devices used in igniting and exploding them. Examples
include items such as primers, detonators, fuzes, cartridges, squibs, boosters, igniters, blasting
caps and bursters. Also included are inert, sectionalized or empty models of ‗live rounds‘ and
drill munitions and or explosive materiel. Inert parts of end-items of conventional munitions are
also included.
Conventional Munitions Restricted or Suspended (CMRS):—Automated system maintained
by 784 CBSG. Identifies and notifies munitions activities and users of restrictions or
suspensions related to munitions items and components. D- Day: The unnamed day on which a
particular operation commences or is to commence. An operation may be the commencement of
hostilities.
a.—The date of a major military effort. The execution date of an operation (as distinguished
from the date the order to execute is issued); the date the operations phase is implemented, by
land assault, air strike, naval bombardment, parachute assault, or amphibious assault. The
highest command or headquarters responsible for coordinating the planning will specify the
exact meaning of D-day within the aforementioned definition. If more than one such event is
mentioned in a single plan, the secondary events will be keyed to the primary event by adding or
subtracting days as necessary. The letter "D" will be the only one used to denote the above. The
command or headquarters directly responsible for the execution of the operation, if other that the
one coordinating the planning, will do so in light of the meanings specified by the highest
planning headquarters.
b.—Time in plans will be indicated by a letter that shows the unit of time employed and figures,
with a minus or plus sign, to indicate the amount of time before or after the referenced event;
e.g., ‗D‘ is for a particular day, ‗H‘ for an hour. Similarly, D+7 means 7 days after Dday and
H+2 means 2 hours after H-hour. If the figure becomes unduly large, for example, D-day plus
90, the designation of D+3 months may be employed; i.e., if the figure following a letter plus a
time unit (D-day, H-hour, etc.) is intended to refer to units of time other than that which follows
the letter, then the unit of time employed with the figure must be spelled out.
Design for Demilitarization (DFD):—An acquisition initiative in the systems engineering

executed or to be executed (as distinguished from the hour the order to execute is issued); the
hour that the operations phase is implemented, either by land assault, parachute assault,
amphibious assault, air or naval bombardment. The highest command or headquarters
coordinating the planning will specify the exact meaning of H-hour within the aforementioned
definition. Normally, the letter "H" will be the only one used to denote the above. However,
when several operations or phases of an operation are being conducted in the same area on D-
day, and confusion may arise through the use of the same hour designation for two or more of
them, any letter of the alphabet may be used except A, C, D, E, J, M or others that may be
reserved for exclusive use.).

     (AM249A)/Complete Round Record List (AM250A) may be used to accomplish this
     count.
     A4.1.6.5. Print CAS count sheets (if used) and provide to count team(s)/team chief(s).
     A4.1.6.6. All assets in structures must be accounted for. If using direct-input or a CAS
     generated count sheet, and assets in the structure are not reflected in CAS or on the count
     sheet, the discrepancy must be documented on a count sheet. The following data must be
     recorded:
        A4.1.6.6.1. NSN.
        A4.1.6.6.2. Lot Number.
        A4.1.6.6.3. CC.

      A4.1.6.7. Inventory discrepancies will be resolved using procedures in paragraph
      7.11.12.
      A4.1.6.8. If a physical recount is required, inventory recounts will be conducted by an
      alternate count team.
      A4.1.6.9. The inventory reconciler will update CAS upon return of the inventory count
      sheets (if used). If inventory count discrepancies exist, the reconciler will re-enter the
      quantities from the count sheets that pertain to each specific discrepancy. If inventory
      count discrepancies still exist, the reconciler will generate inventory recount listings.
  A4.1.7. Sealed Structure Inventory Procedures. The MASO verifies the inventory when
  initially storing munitions in sealed structures, to include Inter-modal containers. After the
  inventory, the MASO (or designated representative) will apply serial-numbered seals to the
  doors of structures.
      A4.1.7.1. If CAS generated or manual count sheets are used, record the Structure
      Number, Seal Number, and the Date seal was applied. If direct-input is used, record this
      information on a memo. The MASO validates this information by signing the count sheet
      or memo.
      A4.1.7.2. Sealed structures need not be inventoried again until:
         A4.1.7.2.1. The MASO changes.
         A4.1.7.2.2. Issues are made.
         A4.1.7.2.3. Items are due periodic inspection.
      A4.1.7.3. Retain documentation until next physical inventory is performed.
      A4.1.7.4. The MASO should consider that the August 10% inventory may have a
      significantly greater number of NSNs to inventory because it is the last month in the 10%
      inventory cycle and CAS will selected all assets for inventory that have not received a
      previous 10%
      A4.1.7.5. Change of MASO Inventory:
         A4.1.7.5.1. If discrepancies exist after the first count, conduct a recount to include a
         check of the following areas:

             A4.1.7.5.1.4. Courtesy storage areas.
             A4.1.7.5.1.5. Any other applicable holding/storage areas not noted above.
             A4.1.7.5.1.6. If discrepancies still exist after performing the above actions, a
             second recount will be conducted with the addition of verifying ‗LITE‘ box
             contents.
             A4.1.7.5.1.7. If discrepancies exist after the second recount, perform the
             following procedures:

          sheets.
          A4.1.7.6.3. Custodians return count sheets in accordance with the MASO suspense to
          ensure the inventory is reconciled in CAS within 30 calendar days of date inventory
          was generated.
          A4.1.7.6.4. MASO reconciles inventory in CAS and generates a new Custody
          Account Listing (AM507A) which has an updated DOLI reflecting the inventory was
          conducted and reconciled. The Custody Account Listing (AM507A) will be placed in

2. These assets are required to support the explosives detector dog mission and are authorized
by AFCAT 21-209V2, Table 2.2., Demolition Munitions. According to HQ PACAF/A7SX, four

munitions are used for non-expendable training use only.
