SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.              All
references to the Air Base Wing (ABW) were changed to Air Base Group (ABG) and Medical
Group (MDG) to Medical Squadron (MDS). Administrative changes to wording was made
throughout the document and grammatical errors addressed. Paragraph 1 definitions was moved
to Attachment 1, the heading was renamed Overview and subparagraphs added. Wording in
Paragraph 2.7 was revised to clarify responsibilities. Paragraph 4 was converted to bullet format
to simplify the information provided and clarify requirements. Information in Attachment 1 was
verified as accurate and updated accordingly.
1. OVERVIEW:
     1.1. This instruction establishes guidance and procedures for performing work and/or
     physical training activities during severe weather conditions on LAAFB.
     1.2. The purpose of this instruction is to provide guidance in the prevention and treatment of
     weather related injury in LAAFB personnel.
     1.3. The focus of this instruction is on thermal injury and severe weather conditions that may
     cause injury to personnel. Cold injuries are unlikely in the local area as temperatures tend to
     be moderate in the winter months and rarely drop below freezing.
2. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:
     2.1. 61st Air Base Group Commander (61 ABG/CC) will enforce base participation in this
     program to ensure the health and safety of all personnel on LAAFB.
     2.2. 61st Medical Squadron Commander (61 MDS/CC) will be the final authority for
     thermal stress conditions for release to LAAFB Notices to Airmen (NOTAMS).
     2.3. 61st Medical Squadron Bioenvironmental Engineering (61 MDS/SGPB) will:
        2.3.1. Use the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) to measure the hourly heat stress
        potential from May to September, when weather conditions dictate.
        2.3.2. Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) maintains the right to use discretion in
        modifying the frequency of monitoring based on local weather conditions (e.g. rain,
        overcast, drop in temperature), as required by AFPAM 48-151, Thermal Stress paragraph
        3.1.4.
        2.3.3. Ensure thermal stress readings and guidance are available 8 hours a day during the
        duty week when the predicated or forecasted outside temperatures reach 850F as a daily
        high, and in support of exercises at the request of commanders.
        2.3.4. Prepare and forward alert messages to 61 MDS/CC for approval. Heat stress
        messages will include Flag Condition according to Attachment 2.
        2.3.5. Forward approved alert message(s) to: 61 ABG Command Post (61 ABG/XP),
        DSN 633-3070, commercial (310) 653-3070 for base notification (e.g. via computer
        ―pop-up‖).
        2.3.6. Investigate all thermal stress illnesses documented through the Air Force Safety
        Automated System (AFSAS).

     to Privacy Act requirements.
  2.5. 61 FSS/FSSV will post Flag Condition(s) when notified by 61 MDS/SGPB at each
  Fitness Center.
  2.6. Unit Fitness Leaders will:
     2.6.1. Determine whether physical training (PT) can be conducted outside during current
     weather conditions. Physical training leaders (PTLs) should consider conducting PT
     indoors when severe environmental conditions exist. Refer to Air Force Instruction 36-
     2905, Fitness Program, Attachment 8, for environmental conditions required for PT
     testing. PT should not be conducted outside under the following conditions:
     2.6.2. Limited visibility due to heavy precipitation/fog.
     2.6.3. Temperature reading less than 200 F.
     2.6.4. Wind speed greater than 20 mph.
     2.6.5. Visibility less than ¾ miles if crossing or running beside vehicular traffic.
     2.6.6. Lightning within 6 miles, or less than 30 minutes after the last observed lightning.
     2.6.7. Significant rain (accumulation <0.5 inch/hour).
     2.6.8. Hail forecasted or reported within 25 miles.
     2.6.9. WBGT greater than 850 F or the heat index greater than 990 F when WBGT is not
     available.
  2.7. Supervisors will:
     2.7.1. Routinely retrieve the thermal stress index from Command Post, and implement
     thermal stress safety procedures accordingly. Work center supervisors may have to
     adjust the work-rest cycles for operations that require heavy personal protective
     equipment.
     2.7.2. Ensure employees working outside in hot environments increase their fluid intake,
     and implement appropriate work-rest cycles, reference Attachment 3.
     2.7.3. Ensure all employees are trained to recognize thermal stress disorders and first aid
     treatment, reference Attachment 4.
     2.7.4. Ensure employees are acclimatized in accordance with paragraph 4.
     2.7.5. Report all thermal stress illnesses to 61 MDS/SGP at DSN 633-6870 or
     commercial(310) 653-6870.
  2.8. Work center employees will:

       2.8.1. Understand the signs and symptoms of thermal stress, and the associated first aid
       treatments.
       2.8.2. Report all thermal stress illnesses to the work center’s supervisor.
3. MONITORING HEAT STRESS:
    3.1. BE will routinely monitor heat stress index during the summer months. The summer
    monitoring period will begin around Memorial Day and end around Labor Day. The summer
    monitoring period may be increased or decreased based on seasonal variations.
       3.1.1. When the predicted or forecasted outside temperatures reach 850 F as a daily high,
       BE will perform heat stress monitoring at least four times during the hottest part of the
       day. Examples of monitoring schedules might be 1000, 1200, 1400, and 1600 or 0900,
       1100, 1300, and 1500.
       3.1.2. When the heat stress index reaches 850 F, BE will initiate heat stress monitoring
       hourly during normal duty hours.
       3.1.3. The heat stress index is a tool to provide guidance to workplace supervisors in
       order to reduce heat stress injuries. The heat stress index should not be used directly for
       operations requiring heavy personal protective equipment or hot indoor operations.
4. ACCLIMATIZATION:
    4.1. Acclimatization is a series of physiological adjustments, which occur when an
    individual is exposed to a hot or cold climate. A period of acclimatization is required for all
    personnel regardless of each individual’s physical condition. The better the individual’s
    physical condition, the quicker acclimatization is reached. Acclimatization is achieved
    through progressive degrees of heat exposure and physical exertion. Acclimatization to heat
    begins with the first exposure and is usually developed to about 50% by the end of the first
    week. Substantial acclimatization (about 78%) should occur by the end of the second week.
    Full acclimatization is attained quickest by gradually increasing period of work in the heat.
    4.2. Acclimatization is required for the following:
       4.2.1. Individuals who are routinely and occupationally exposed to strenuous duties or
       heavy work need acclimatization each year. This may occur during regular duty or work
       as outside temperatures increase during the spring and summer.
       4.2.2. Newly assigned personnel arriving from cooler climates should follow the
       acclimatization guidelines given above.
       4.2.3. Personnel returning to work after four days of illness should undergo a four-day
       reacclimatization.
       4.2.4. Personnel returning to work after nine or more days away from work should
       undergo a four-day reacclimatization.
    4.3. For personnel needing acclimatization supervisors should adjust work schedules. The
    most strenuous tasks should be performed early in the morning or late in the evening with
    lighter duty tasks performed during the remainder of the duty day. As personnel become
    acclimatized, work schedules can be shifted back to normal routines. When un-acclimated
    personnel are exposed to heat, they may experience some discomfort and signs of heat strain,
LOSANGELESAFBI48-151 6 NOVEMBER 2012                                                       5


  such as high body temperature, increased heart rate and fatigue on the first day. On each
  succeeding day, personnel’s ability to perform at the same level of heat stress improves as
  signs of discomfort and strain diminish. During the two weeks it takes to acclimatize,
  personnel should be especially aware of the signs and symptoms of heat stress disorders and
  drink plenty of water. When discomfort and heat stress symptoms occur, personnel should
  self-pace their activities to perform below maximum physical capacity by adjusting their
  work speed and interspersing brief, unscheduled and in-place breaks. After a period of one
  to two weeks, personnel should be able to perform all tasks without difficulty.

contributions of metabolic cost of work, environmental factors (air temperature, humidity, air
movement, etc.) and clothing. In simple terms, heat stress is the body burden from these three
categories above.
Heat Stress Posting— Visual notification of heat stress flag conditions, work rest cycles and or
special personal protective equipment.
May— Indicates an acceptable or satisfactory method of accomplishment.
Should— Indicates a preferred method of accomplishment.
Thermal Stress— The common term used to cover both heat and cold stress.
Wet Bulb Globe Temperature— The WBGT is an instrument used to measure the heat stress
index.

A3.2. Personal Protective Equipment Adjustment: Personnel required to wear heavy personal
protective equipment (e.g. tyvek suits, respiratory protection, etc.) during normal work center
processes have an increase potential for heat stress. Supervisors of personnel who require heavy
personal protective equipment should contact 61 MDG/SGPB (653-6539/6636/6644) to identify
the appropriate correction factors to Table A3.1.

A3.3. Prevention of Heat Stress Disorders:
   A3.3.1. Education: Personnel working and/or training in hot environments must be educated
   on the causes, symptoms, first-aid treatments and prevention of heat disorders. Personnel
   must also be educated on the following factors, which may contribute to heat injury.
   A3.3.2. Water: Drink large quantities of cool water to make up for water lost through
   sweating. It is better to drink small amounts of water frequently (a pint every 20 minutes) to
   replace water than to drink large amounts less frequently. Milk and coffee do not make up for
   water loss. Carbonated beverages, while containing water, are not as effective as water in
   keeping the body hydrated because of the tendency to delay gastric emptying.
   A3.3.3. Salt: Some salt is lost in the sweat. Because the typical North American diet
   contains so much salt, an individual should season food to taste, but should not make any
   additional attempts to add excessive salt to the diet. Salt tablets must not be used except
   under special operating environments when ordered by competent medical authority.
   A3.3.4. Clothing: Wear loose fitting clothing, especially at the neck and wrist, to allow air
   circulation. Wear appropriate headgear. When exposed to the Sun’s rays, cover yourself and
   apply a sun-blocking lotion to prevent sunburn. When not exposed to the sun, consideration
   should be given to wearing the least allowable amount of clothing.
   A3.3.5. Acclimatization: Personnel must be acclimated to heat exposures. See paragraph 4.
   A3.3.6. Work Schedules: Modify work schedules to perform the heaviest work in the coolest
   parts of the day. When working in hot environments, establish work and rest cycles as
   outlined in Table A3.1. Take rest breaks in cool, shaded areas.
   A3.3.7. Food: Avoid eating greasy, fatty or heavy foods.
