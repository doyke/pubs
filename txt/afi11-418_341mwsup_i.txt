1. General.
   1.1. The basic supervision structure for flying operations consists of the Operations Group
   Commander (OG/CC), the Supervisor of Flying (SOF) and the squadron supervisors, i.e.,
   Operations Supervisor (Ops Sup, also referred to as Top 3).
   1.2. The chain of supervision begins with the OG/CC, through the SOF, down to the
   individual squadron supervisors. The requirements for each position are specified in para 3.
   Specific duties and responsibilities are defined throughout this instruction.
   1.3. For the purpose of this instruction “experienced” is used in accordance with (IAW) the
   definition provided in the Mission Design Series (MDS) specific AFI 11-2MDS Volume 1.
      1.3.1. For the purposes of this instruction only, aircrews are also considered
      “experienced” when previously rated “experienced” in another MDS or previously rated
      “experienced” in a different crew position in the same MDS. These individuals must then
      be selected by the Squadron CC and approved by the OG/CC for operations supervision
      responsibilities.
      1.3.2. Where no definition is provided, “experienced” will be determined by the unit
      squadron commander and approved by OG/CC.
2. Functions:
   2.1. SOF. When on duty, the SOF is a group-level position and is the direct representative of
   the OG/CC. The SOF is the focal point for command and control of flight operations. OG/CC
   decision authority is delegated to this position to accomplish the mission.
      2.1.1. SOF is not required for rescue/weather/electronic attack/airlift/air refueling/special
      operations/deployed U-2 Ops. (For C2ISR, the OG/CC will determine if a SOF program
 4                                                  AFI11-418_341MWSUP_I 30 MAY 2013


        is required. If a program is established this Instruction applies. At a minimum, C2ISR
        units will establish an Ops Sup/Top 3 program.)
        2.1.2. (Added-341MW) Operations Assistant (OA). The OA is an assistant to the SOF.
        The SOF and OA may not be the same person. The OA may be any unit member. The
        SOF will be assisted by the OA as required.
     2.2. Ops Sup/Top 3. The squadron Ops Sup/Top 3 will only be filled by the following
     individuals: the squadron commander, the squadron operations officer, assistant operations
     officer(s), flight commanders, or other individuals deemed qualified by the squadron
     commander and approved by the OG/CC. ANG/AFRC: OG/CC or Air Operations Officer
     (AOO) will determine requirements for Ops Sup and will determine the appropriate
     personnel to fill the Ops Sup position. ANG/AFRC may combine SOF and Ops Sup duties.
        2.2.1. Squadron commander and operations officer decision authority may be delegated
        to this position to make operations-related decisions and recommendations.
        2.2.2. (Added-341MW) The Ops Sup and SOF may be combined when individuals are
        qualified in both positions.
3. Operations. This section identifies the minimum flying unit supervisory requirements
depending on types of operations involved. (Additional requirements can be defined in the unit
supplement).
     3.1. Types of Operations. The definitions for types of operations that are used in Table 1
     are:
        3.1.1. Daily Flying Operations. Normal or surge operations at the unit's home station
        (this does not include other types of operations defined below).
        3.1.2. On-Going Off Station Sorties. Missions/sorties that do not takeoff or land at
        home station.
        3.1.3. Deployed Operations. Flight operations away from home station that are part of
        a deployment, exercise or contingency.
        3.1.4. Scrambles. Aircraft launched on a scramble order from an alert posture.
     3.2. Minimum Supervision Requirements. These are outlined in Table 1 for each type of
     operation.

Notes:
1. The SOF and Ops Sup may leave the unit operations complex (as defined by the unit
   supplement to this instruction) after aircraft depart the local area, workload permitting and
   will be immediately available by telephone, pager, radio or intercom. The SOF and Ops Sup
   will be at their duty locations 45 minutes prior to the estimated time of arrival of unit aircraft.
   For reduced flying operations the OG/CC may determine if a SOF is required. Reduced
   flying operations are defined as 4 or less fighter aircraft or 2 or less of the same type of non-
   fighter aircraft or, while adhering to these limitations for fighter and non-fighter aircraft, 6
   total aircraft if 2 or more are RPA.
2. For deployed operations, the detachment commander will coordinate with host base
   Operations Group for supervision requirements. This may involve integrating into the host
   base SOF and/or Ops Sup program.

3. Must be immediately available by telephone, pager, radio, or intercom. (USAFE: Ops Sup
   for on-going off station sorties can be filled by an experienced aircrew member (SDO) as
   defined in the unit supplement.)

     a SOF, be the primary source of technical assistance.
     4.4.4. For situations where both the SOF and Ops Sup/Top 3 are not qualified to provide
     technical assistance to the type of aircraft airborne, schedule an instructor or experienced
     crewmember to be immediately available for aircraft technical assistance.
     4.4.5. Be responsible for the execution of the daily flying schedule and coordinate any
     mission changes as required (e.g. aircraft tail number changes, crew swaps, flight-plan
     and airspace changes). Note: Mission commanders/flight leads are required to coordinate
     with the Ops Sup/Top 3 prior to the flight brief when intended sortie type, profile,
     airspace, and/or aircraft configuration do not match the approved schedule.

        and repair of the applicable SOF facilities and equipment.
        4.5.3. Mission Support group/Logistic Readiness group commanders are responsible for
        maintenance, upgrade and repair of the SOF vehicle.
5. Handling of In-Flight Emergencies:
     5.1. The primary objective during an abnormal/emergency situation is the safe recovery of
     the aircrew and aircraft. When establishing procedures, units will consider:
        5.1.1. Providing a single, discrete frequency for recovering an emergency aircraft. ATC
        and the emergency aircrew should determine when to use a single frequency approach
        (SFA). The SOF will have access to the SFA. The SFA should be available to
        crash/fire/rescue personnel to monitor the recovery.
        5.1.2. Using the command post, or other capable agency, to notify all appropriate
        agencies and key personnel of an IFE and provide situation updates.
            5.1.2.1. (Added-341MW) 40 HS SOF will track flying activities and be the central
            source for information during an emergency. All pertinent information will be
            relayed to command post to facilitate proper reporting.
        5.1.3. Prioritizing actions during concurrent emergencies/abnormal situations.
        5.1.4. Authorizing direct communications (over discrete SOF or squadron common
        frequency) from the Ops Sup/Top 3 to an IFE aircrew. NOTE: Only ATC personnel may
        authorize direct communication over ATC frequencies, including the SFA frequency.
        However, this does not preclude the SOF and/or Ops Sup/Top 3 from using whatever
        communication necessary, to include GUARD and SFA, to prevent an unsafe situation
        that could immediately jeopardize safe recovery.
AFI11-418_341MWSUP_I 30 MAY 2013                                                               9


      5.1.5. That only the ground on-scene commander, normally the fire chief, can terminate
      an emergency.
      5.1.6. That the final decision during any IFE/abnormal situation rests with the aircraft
      commander. However, SOFs may declare an IFE for any aircraft based on their
      knowledge of the aircraft and the flight and airfield environment.
      5.1.7. Obtaining a chase ship for single ship emergency aircraft if time permits.
      5.1.8. If the SOF is not qualified in or technically knowledgeable of the aircraft with an
      IFE, then directing the Ops Sup/Top 3 or other highly experienced individual to report to
      the SOF's duty location during an abnormal situation/recovery if time permits.
6. SOF Guidance. Unless noted otherwise, this guidance applies to the Ops Sup/Top 3 when a
SOF is either unavailable or not used.
   6.1. SOF/ATC Relationship:
      6.1.1. The separation and sequencing of traffic are the responsibilities of ATC. Unless
      safety is an issue, the SOF will work directly with the watch supervisor. To promote
      effective and efficient flight operations, the SOF may suggest, based on knowledge of the
      flying schedule and unique circumstances of individual missions, actions that affect ATC
      concerns or desires.
      6.1.2. Except in an emergency, the SOF will not transmit over ATC frequencies without
      prior coordination with ATC (this does not apply to dedicated SOF frequencies). All
      radio transmissions to a distressed aircrew, from other than the SOF or ATC, will be
      coordinated through the SOF (this does not apply to the Ops Sup/Top3 if communicating
      to the aircrew via a squadron common frequency).
   6.2. Duty Hours:
      6.2.1. Prior to beginning supervisory duties, the SOF will meet crew rest requirements as
      directed by AFI 11-202 Volume 3, General Flight Rules, as supplemented.
      6.2.2. Maximum duty day for SOF is 16 hours with a limit of 12 hours performing SOF
      duties. The OG/CC is waiver authority and may extend a SOF duty day up to 16 hours
      on a case-by-case basis. (AFGSC Missile Wings: For alert and scramble operations, the
      SOF maximum duty day is 24 hrs as long as alert/sleeping facilities are readily available).
      6.2.3. The SOF will be at the prescribed duty location IAW Table 1 NLT 30 minutes
      prior to first takeoff in order to complete required duties in paragraph 4.3
   6.3. Duty Location:
      6.3.1. Primary Duty Location. The primary duty location for active duty units will be
      in the control tower. (AFGSC Missile Wings: the primary duty location will be
      designated by the OG/CC).
      6.3.1. (341MW) The primary SOF duty location will be the unit operations desk.
      6.3.2. Alternate Duty Location. The OG/CC will designate alternate duty locations in
      the unit supplement to this instruction. As a minimum, the location must have adequate
      communication equipment and the capability to monitor weather conditions. It is
      desirable to have a SOF duty position from which ground operations, takeoffs, landings
10                                                  AFI11-418_341MWSUP_I 30 MAY 2013


     and local traffic patterns can be observed. The following is a list of recommended
     alternate locations:
     6.3.2. (341MW) Alternate Duty Location. The alternate duty location will be the alert
     vehicle, 40 HS alert facility, or command post. The SOF/Ops Sup must have access to the
     required equipment in 6.4.1.
        6.3.2.1. The SOF vehicle on the airfield.
        6.3.2.2. The runway monitoring unit (RMU)/runway supervisory unit (RSU).
        6.3.2.3. The unit dispatch desk.
        6.3.2.4. The command post.
     6.3.3. At both the primary and alternate duty locations the SOF will have timely access
     to a SOF vehicle and the airfield environment when required. AFRC: units are not
     required to have a dedicated vehicle for the SOF, but must be provided access to a
     vehicle to perform required duties in a timely manner.
  6.4. Equipment:
     6.4.1. The following communication equipment must be functional and immediately
     available to the SOF:
        6.4.1.1. A dedicated multi-frequency radio (UHF, VHF and/or HF, as appropriate
        based on supported aircraft capabilities).
        6.4.1.2. A telephone (land-line or cellular telephone) or FM radio to contact the
        OG/CC (or designated representative), command post, Ops Sups, weather facility and
        ATC watch supervisors. Dedicated phone lines (hot-lines) are preferred.
        6.4.1.3. (Added-341MW) The SOF will notify 40 HS/DOO anytime SOF
        equipment becomes inoperative. The on-duty SOF will coordinate to have the
        equipment repaired if it prevents the SOF from performing the duties outlined in
        AFI11-418 and this supplement.
     6.4.2. Access to approved weather resources will be available (net-centric data
     dissemination system, etc).
     6.4.3. Units are required to have a dedicated SOF vehicle immediately available to the
     SOF and positioned to respond to emergencies, perform airfield inspections, or other
     official functions. This vehicle must have a flight line clearance and be equipped with a
     multi-channel radio capable of contacting unit aircraft and ATC. Waiver authority for this
     requirement is the Wing Commander or equivalent.
     6.4.4. Locally developed checklists will be available to outline procedures for normal
     and emergency situations that included, as a minimum, the items listed in Attachment 2.
     6.4.5. Dedicated binoculars will be immediately available for SOF use when either in the
     primary or alternate duty location for a clear view of the runway.
     6.4.6. A SOF library will be available (either hard copy or electronic as outlined in the
     unit supplement to this instruction) that includes applicable directives and instructions (to
AFI11-418_341MWSUP_I 30 MAY 2013                                                              11

     proven maturity, judgment and supervisory ability and must be combat mission ready
     (CMR) or basic mission capable (BMC) in a unit aircraft
         6.5.1.1. Non-CMR (N-CMR)/non-BMC (N-BMC) aircrew members may perform
         SOF duties at the discretion of the OG/CC on the condition that the status must be
         temporary in nature and all SOF currencies must be maintained IAW paragraph 6.7.
         6.5.1.2. (Added-341MW) The SOF will be an experienced (IAW paragraph 1.3)
         rated officer with proven maturity, judgment, and supervisory ability and must be
         combat mission ready (CMR) or basic mission capable (BMC), with the exception of
         select unit reservists. Reserve personnel authorized to hold SOF shifts will be
         annotated on an appointment letter, signed by the 40 HS/CC.
     6.5.2. To gain initial certification, all SOFs will complete the SOF upgrade program
     IAW paragraph 6.6.
     6.5.3. SOFs that are currently under a Duties Not Involving Flying (DNIF) status may
     perform SOF duties when specifically cleared by a flight surgeon on an AF Form 1042.
     6.5.4. Loss of SOF certification will occur for any of the following reasons:
         6.5.4.1. PCS or 179/365 day TDYs (unless the individual is performing SOF duties
         and able to retain currency while TDY).
         6.5.4.2. Direct action by the OG/CC through a written statement in the individuals
         training folder and removal from the unit “Letter of Xs” or equivalent document. Any

   duty period (if any).
      8.10.1. At a minimum, Ops Sup/Top 3 upgrade will consist of at least one supervised
      tour with an experience Ops Sup/Top 3 with a review of applicable AF, HHQ, and local
      published guidance relating to the daily operations and supervision of squadron aircraft.
      8.10.2. Documentation for the Ops Sup/Top 3 upgrade is at the discretion of the unit, but
      will include, as a minimum, proof of training completion that is stored in the individual’s
      training folder (as applicable).
      8.10.2. (341MW) Documentation for the Ops Sup/Top 3 upgrade will include a letter
