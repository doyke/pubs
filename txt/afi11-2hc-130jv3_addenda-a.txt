                                             Chapter 1

                                             POLICY

1.1. General. Those who use this instruction should bear in mind that an infinite number of
variations are available and that the cargo compartment configurations listed here are the most
typical encountered day to day. If deviations are required, use sound judgment and operational
risk management to meet mission demands. This instruction establishes basic cargo compartment
configuration, standard equipment, and equipment locations aboard HC-130J aircraft. Some HC-
130J aircraft have additional equipment installed that may affect configuring the aircraft as
listed. For operational planning purposes, each configuration has an average time annotated and
number of personnel to configure the airplane. The times quoted are approximate figures and are
configuration times only. They do not include de-configuration times. For example,
reconfiguring from a P-1 configuration, 84 sidewall and center aisle seats to a C-1 configuration
(clean floor) requires more than one-half hour for one person, which is the time allocated to
configure a C-1 configuration.
1.2. Responsibility. Operational plans must consider the most appropriate configuration that
satisfies mission requirements and permits the minimum amount of variations and man-hours to
change. USAF units performing services on HC-130J aircraft (i.e., maintenance, aerial port, and
Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) are responsible for configuring the aircraft IAW this
instruction and as outlined in mission directives, to include equipment stowage/installation IAW
the configuration and equipment tables. AFE personnel will ensure all life sustaining equipment
is positioned on the aircraft to meet mission requirements IAW Table 1.1 Maintenance personnel
will ensure all required and mission specific equipment is positioned aboard the aircraft to meet
mission requirements IAW Tables 2.1 and 2.2 Some equipment listed in Table 2.2 is roll
on/roll off equipment controlled by unit designated personnel. Before home station departure,
maintenance personnel are responsible for configuring the aircraft (including modifications) to
meet mission requirements IAW Figures 3.1 thru 3.56.3 For the CP-2 through CP-5
configurations, the sidewall seats will be stowed to facilitate preflight of the Enhanced Cargo
Handling System (ECHS) rails and then lowered by aircrew with maintenance assistance. After
departure from home station, the aircrew will accomplish all configurations with assistance by
maintenance/aerial port personnel if available. During preflight, aircrew will ensure required
mission equipment has been provided and is properly installed. When the aircraft configuration
is not completed prior to aircrew show time, the loadmaster (LM) will assist in the completion of
the configuration, after accomplishing required pre-departure duties (i.e., preflight, loading, etc.).
LMs have overall responsibility for configuration management and proper installation of
equipment on the aircraft.
1.3. Standard Configuration Codes. Use the following codes when referring to HC-130J
cargo compartment configurations.
   1.3.1. AE - Aeromedical Evacuation
   1.3.2. C - Cargo
   1.3.3. CP - Cargo and Passengers
   1.3.4. LP - PSYOPS
 6                                     AFI11-2HC-130JV3_ADDENDA-A 3 OCTOBER 2012


     1.3.5. P - Passengers
     1.3.6. RAPID – Infil/Exfil Equipment or Personnel
     1.3.7. TAC - Tactical Airdrop Cargo
     1.3.8. TAP - Tactical Airdrop Paratroop
     1.3.9. RSQ – Rescue Configuration
1.4. Modifications. Configuration codes of this instruction may require modifications for a
specific mission. Each modification must be carefully evaluated prior to mission operation to
ensure maximum flight safety and aircraft equipment compatibility. Each mission directive will
identify basic configuration codes and modifications to satisfy mission requirements. For
example, an aeromedical evacuation mission may require more litters than available in
configuration AE-1. Consult appropriate configuration charts to determine where the desired
additional litters can be installed and which seats must be removed. Indicate in the mission
directive, by position (left or right, and number) which seats are deleted and (by alphabetical
position) litter tier provisions are installed. Example: Configuration AE-1(Mod), remove seats
12, 13, 14, and 15 left and right, install litter tier provisions C and D.
1.5. Weight and Balance.
     1.5.1. Configuration equipment and necessary supply changes affect aircraft weight and
     balance. To standardize equipment quantities and location, items shown in Table 2.1 will be
     included in the aircraft basic weight and remain on the aircraft except for maintenance,
     inspection, and when directed by this AFI. Equipment listed in Tables 1.1 and 2.2 will be
     added as necessary when computing the weight and balance and entered in
     Communications/Navigation/Identification-Management Unit (CNI-MU) and references 5, 6,
     or 7 of DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F-Transport/Tactical. The
     LM will enter the weight contained in the required equipment table for the applicable
     configuration in the CNI-MU and when preparing the DD Form 365-4. Adjustments will be
     made when the actual on board weight of these items vary from the data shown. Add aircraft
     armor (Table 4.2) into the DD Form 365-4 if armor is installed on the aircraft. Paratroop
     door armor moments need to be re-calculated when armor is re-positioned. DD Form 365-4
     will be completed IAW instructions in Chapter 5 of this instruction.
     1.5.2. When a configuration change that removes items listed in Table 2.1 is accomplished
     at a Forward Operating Location (FOL) and no Quality Assurance Branch (QA) weight and
     balance authority is deployed to the location, maintenance personnel will put an info note in
     the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document indicating the weight,
     fuselage station and moment of any equipment added or removed. The LM will add or
     subtract the listed weight and moment from the last entry in the DD Form 365-3, Chart C.
     Annotate the new weight and moment in Block 1 of DD 365-4, Weight and Balance
     Clearance Form F. Configuration changes accomplished at home station require a QA
     update to the DD Form 365-3, Chart C. EXCEPTION: Minor equipment changes after crew
     reporting may be annotated on the DD Form 365-4, by the LM.
1.6. Revisions. All revisions will consist of electronic interim change (IC) or new publication.
Personnel at all echelons are encouraged to make recommendations to improve this instruction.

1.7. Supplements. Subordinate unit supplements to this instruction that change the basic
policies, procedures, or formats prescribed herein are prohibited. EXCEPTION: Groups may
supplement Table 2.2 with additional items. They may also supplement Chapter 3 with
specified configuration modifications (MOD) to accommodate theater unique requirements.
Forward supplements to HQ ACC/A3J for approval.
1.8. Aircrew Life Sustaining Equipment Configuration. HC-130J aircraft are configured
with standard quantities of aircrew life sustaining equipment (ALSE) IAW this instruction.
Configure aircraft as listed in Table 1.1 During aircraft contingency/deployment generations, it
is imperative that aircraft deploy with the full complement of ALSE. This equipment must be at
forward operating locations to allow maximum mission flexibility when aircraft are away from
home station. In the event installed ALSE inspection dates expire while the aircraft is on alert
status or away from operating location, place these items in the AFTO Form 781A on a red dash
until the aircraft goes off alert or returns to operating location. When aircraft is released from
alert or returns to operating location, upgrade to a red X IAW TO 00-20-1 Aerospace Equipment
Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures.
   1.8.1. Aircraft Transfer Requirements. When transferring aircraft, position ALSE IAW
   permanent transfer configuration. Losing unit will contact the gaining organization’s AFE
   section and initiate transfer of required aircraft-installed ALSE and inspection records. The
   gaining organization will conduct an acceptance inspection and forward a copy of
   discrepancies, to include any equipment shortages, to their respective MAJCOM IAW TO
   00-20-1. Without documented coordination and approval, do not transfer aircraft with less
   than the required equipment. The losing organization must make up any shortages from on-
   hand assets to ensure transferring aircraft has required equipment.
   1.8.2. ALSE Stowage Bins. Handle ALSE with care to avoid damage to the equipment.
   ALSE will always be placed in the stowage bins, unless stowed elsewhere for aircraft CG
   limitations. The primary purpose of all life support stowage bins is for ALSE. Oil, hydraulic
   fluid or other liquids will not be placed in the stowage bins.
1.8.3. The unit or service being airdropped will furnish the required number of life preservers
for airdrop of personnel over or near bodies of water.Wear of flotation devices will be in
accordance with AFI and user service directives.

NOTES:
1. Minimum equipment required. Units may add more equipment to meet specific mission or
theater requirements. At all times the amount of tiedown equipment required will include enough
equipment to secure the landing gear in an emergency as well as secure all cargo and loose
equipment. When additional equipment is added, QA will update the DD Form 365-3, Chart C,
Basic Weight and Balance Record. (See exception in paragraph 1.5. of this AFI.).
2. Minimum number of ground loading ramps required. More ramps will be added for RAPID
configurations. Generation IV ramps are the only type authorized for RAPID configurations. A
full set of Canary Slides may be used in lieu of ground loading ramps.
3. Minimum life support equipment required IAW AFI 11-301, Vol 2
4. The number of raft spaces dictates the total number of personnel (crew and passengers) that may
be on the aircraft for over-water missions. In other words, if you have two 46 man rafts installed
you can only have 92 personnel, including crew, on board for over-water missions.
5. All two-gallon emergency water containers will be stored empty. If mission dictates, containers
will be sanitized and filled with water by support personnel. Annotate in 781K emergency water
containers are full. After the mission, sanitize and dry containers then reinstall. When the water
containers are filled the DD Form 365-3, Chart C, Basic Weight and Balance Record will be
updated to reflect the added weight. (See exception in paragraph 1.5. of this AFI.)
6. These items may be removed and maintained in the CDS airdrop kit within the squadron.
7. Number of seats required depends on mission requirements. Ensure there are enough seats
onboard to complete mission.
8. Aircraft 09-0108 is exempt from this requirement until it is modified for Ramp Air Deflectors

                                              Chapter 3

  FLOOR PLANS AND REQUIRED EQUIPMENT WEIGHT AND BALANCE DATA

3.1. General. This chapter contains basic cargo compartment configuration in floor plan format
and weight, location, and moment data for associated required equipment.
3.2. Configuration. Although basic configuration modifications are authorized to meet special
requirements, the following factors shall be considered:
   3.2.1. Single sidewall seats shall not be used unless connected to a double sidewall seat
   (except for specific configurations.)
   3.2.2. Passengers/ambulatory patients may not be seated closer than 30 inches in front of
   palletized, netted cargo or cargo secure with straps. This does not apply to cargo restrained
   by chains/chain bridle assemblies. When palletized or non-palletized cargo is secured with
   aircraft tie down chains, the 30-inch spacing is not required.      EXCEPTION: Always
   maintain the 30-inch spacing on AE missions, when carrying litters.
       3.2.2.1. Parachutes will be carried IAW Table 1.1 When passengers/troops are carried
       with parachutes on board, up to four seats will not be available in the cargo compartment.
   3.2.3. Normal spacing for paratroopers is 24 inches; however, spacing will be as mission
   dictates. Aircraft without accommodations for 24-inch spacing may be configured in 20-inch
   spacing.
   3.2.4. Cargo height in pallet position two may be restricted if overhead equipment rack(s)
   protrude into the cargo area. This restriction will be 76 inches and will begin at the inboard
   side of the cargo handling system rails and extend inboard 12 inches. This restriction could
   be on either or both sides of the aircraft.
   3.2.5. For flight, the aircraft ramp’s cargo weight limit is 5,000 pounds of floor loaded or
   palletized cargo in pallet position eight (six for short), (to include the weight of pallet and
   nets). See TO 1C-130(H)J-9 for other restrictions.
   3.2.6. Changes in configuration may affect overall aircraft center of gravity (CG). NOTE:
   The addition of aircraft defensive systems, Kevlar, and other modifications produces a
   forward CG which must be countered by adjusting the load center of balance within TO 1C-
   130(H)J-1 limits. Weight for this equipment is in Table 4.8 and 4.9
   3.2.7. This chapter’s drawings are not drawn precisely to scale with respect to actual aircraft
   locations. Clear space depicted forward of the first center aisle seat and aft of the last center
   aisle seat on TAP-1 configuration is unusable. NOTE: Center aisle seats begin at the first
   seat stanchion point FS 262
   3.2.8. A 20-inch clear area is required on the forward right side of a ramp pallet to allow
   access to aft latrine facilities. A safety aisle is required in pallet positions three, four, and six.
   (Para 4.2.3, Figure 4.1)
   3.2.9. Trashcans, other than integral containers, will not be carried.
   3.2.10. Seats 1 and 2, left side will be stowed to allow unrestricted flight deck/crew entrance
   door access when the seats are not needed to accomplish a specific mission.
 16                                    AFI11-2HC-130JV3_ADDENDA-A 3 OCTOBER 2012


   3.2.11. Configurations’ seat totals include seats designated for LMs.
   3.2.12. ECHS lock/seat stanchion locations is provided in Table 4.10
   3.2.13. Aeromedical evacuation (AE) configurations. Medical Crew Directors (MCD) and
   Charge Medical Technician (CMT) will determine final litter equipment configuration and
   aeromedical evacuation crewmember (AECM) seating. AECM seat locations may vary
   based on patient/cabin observation requirements. Overhead equipment racks, missile defense
   system modifications, and secure voice communications system will decrease litter capacity
   in litter tiers adjacent to their installation. Up to six seats are required for AECM’s/LM(s)
   depending on crew complement. Seats are numbered for identification from front to rear and
   will be referred to as seat 1-left, or seat 1-right, etc. Litter tiers are identified alphabetically
   and litter spaces identified numerically from lowest (1) to highest (5). On litter tier
   configuration illustrations, the number in parentheses indicates total litters per tier. Roller
   conveyers will be stowed where litters and seats are rigged. AE equipment, which may be
   secured in unused seats if floor space is limited, may reduce seat availability. Portable
   therapeutic liquid oxygen (PTLOX) shall be stowed in a location to prevent contact with
   fuels or hydraulic fluids. NOTE: Five portable oxygen bottles/PBEs will be available for
   AE personnel on AE configurations.
   3.2.14. Aircraft protective armor will be added as needed, and must be added into Ref. 7 of
   the DD Form 365-4.
   3.2.15. Some aircraft may be nose heavy due to armor installation and other modifications.
   Actual amount of passengers/litter patients/paratroopers/cargo allowed onboard may vary as
   determined by aircraft center of gravity limitations.
   3.2.16. When seating passengers next to cargo, consideration should be given to cargo
   (palletized/rolling stock) size and adequate passenger legroom. For cargo width up to 76
   inches, passengers may be seated on both sides. For widths 77-96 inches, passengers may be
   seated on one side if the cargo is offset to one side laterally. For widths 97 inches or greater,
   no passengers will be seated next to the cargo. For cargo positioned within the wheel well
   area: cargo width up to 52 inches, passengers may be seated on both sides; for widths 53-72
   inches, passengers may be seated on one side of cargo if offset; and for widths 73 inches and
   greater, no passengers will be seated in the wheel well.
3.3. Troop Life Preserver. If paratroopers are jumping near or over large bodies of water, the
service being airdropped will furnish required life preservers. However, life preservers, as
indicated in applicable configurations, will still be provided as required to cover emergency
ditching operations.
3.4. Crew/Passenger/Troop Drinking Water. Each basic configuration provides for an
adequate amount of drinking water. For example, a two-gallon water container will always be
provided; and for missions requiring more water in accordance with Table 5.3, additional
containers are available. Table 5.3 is provided to assist in determining water quantities.
However, the table is not provided as an absolute requirement and should not be used to cause
mission delay or refusal to airlift passengers. At no time will a mission be flown with no water
aboard. NOTE: When deploying to an austere environment or locations where a potable water
source is unavailable, ensure a sufficient amount of water is onboard to complete the mission.

NOTES:
1. Individual A-22 containers, single stick up to 8 (48x48 inch) containers (even or odd
number) or double stick up to 16 (48X48 inch) may be airdropped utilizing this configuration. A
maximum of 10 A-7A or A-21 containers may be dropped over the ramp using this
configuration.
2. Mission tasking units will use the following criteria to schedule the buffer stop assembly
(BSA) for CDS missions:
    a. The BSA will be installed when the total A-22 containers weigh 5,001 pounds or more
    and are airdropped on a single pass. When airdropping a combined rigged weight of 5,000
    pounds or less, an alternate forward barrier (IAW TO 1C-130(H)J-9) system may be used
    in lieu of the BSA.
3. Centerline vertical restraint (CVR) must be rigged after BSA is loaded. CVR is installed
from aft to fwd and will be installed as required for the number of bundles being dropped. See
TO 1C-130(H)J-9, Section VII C for installation procedures.
4. Number of containers governs seat availability.
5. Combination drop is limited to single stick. Single stick weight cannot exceed 5,000 pounds.
A maximum of 20 paratroopers may be tailgated depending on seats available and number of
CDS containers.

                                           Chapter 4

                                     REFERENCE DATA

4.1. General. This chapter contains reference data to assist personnel in load planning.
4.2. Emergency Exits and Safety Aisles. Load aircraft in such a manner that the following
emergency exits and safety aisles are available:
   4.2.1. Equipment will not be positioned in a manner that obstructs the side emergency
   escape hatches. An obstruction is any equipment that prevents the effective means of rapid
   evacuation. Litters and seats erected across an emergency exit are not considered to be an
   obstruction.
   4.2.2. One unobstructed emergency exit will be available for each 20 passengers/troops.
   (This does not restrict overwater flights if the three overhead escape hatches are available for
   egress.)
   4.2.3. When passengers are being airlifted, an unobstructed aisleway will be maintained in
   the wheel well (pallet positions 3 & 4) and ramp area (pallet position 6) to provide access to
   emergency exits. In the wheel well area, the aisleway will be a minimum of 14 inches wide
   between the outer edge of the cargo and the aircraft and will begin at the cargo floor or cargo
   handling system (CHS) outboard frame. Tiedown equipment (463L nets, straps, chains, and
   devices) shall not normally be considered an obstruction. The CHS outboard frame provides
   8 inches of the 14-inch requirement on the main cargo floor (Figure 4.1). In the ramp area,
   the aisleway will be a minimum of 8 inches beginning at the outboard edge of the CHS
   outboard frame. The aisleway should normally be on the left side of the aircraft. If the
   aisleway is placed on the right side of the aircraft, then clearance to the right side of the
   aircraft must be maintained. Additionally, access to aft latrine facilities requires a 20-inch
   clear area on the forward right side of cargo loaded on the ramp. The clear area must be on
   the right side of the pallet.
   4.2.4. If the aisleway requirement in paragraph 4.2.3 cannot be achieved on missions
   carrying crew only or MEPs authorized by operations order/plan or DIRMOBFOR, then an
   aisleway will be maintained in the wheel well area that provides a minimum of 14 inches
   between the outer edge of the cargo and aircraft beginning no higher than 36 inches above
   the floor/pallet/platform or a minimum of 30 inches between the outer edge of cargo and the
   aircraft beginning no higher than 60 inches above the floor/pallet/platform. The CHS
   outboard frame provides 8 inches of this requirement on the main cargo floor (Figure 4.1).
   MAJCOM/A3 is authorized to waive this requirement based on MAJCOM/A3T evaluation
   and recommendation.
   4.2.5. During airdrop missions LMs shall have access to the rear of the aircraft to
   accomplish tactical checklists.
   4.2.6. On all missions, cargo will be loaded in such a way that the crew will have access to
   the rear of the aircraft. Loads in Section VI of TO 1C-130(H)J-9 are specific and do not
   require a waiver.

        WEIGHT & BALANCE INPUTS AND DD FORM 365-4 INSTRUCTIONS

5.1. Introduction. The LM is responsible for entering weight and balance data into the CNI-
MU Weight and Balance pages, and transferring that information onto the DD Form 365-4
Form-F. This can either be accomplished manually, or electronically utilizing the Automated
Form F (AFF) program and printer. Instructions for use of the AFF program can be found in the
C-130 AFF training guide.
5.2. Load Planning. The cargo load must be planned so the center of gravity of the loaded
aircraft will be within the specified forward and aft limits for any given operating condition.
Consideration must also be given to offload sequence, aircraft limitations, and emergency
jettisoning. Math charts contained in TOs 1C-130(H)J-5-1 and 1C-130(H)J-5-2 are tools, which
may be used for load planning. When the fuel load is unknown, load plan for a 20-22 percent of
MAC zero fuel.
5.3. General Instructions. These instructions apply to Transport Forms F using simplified
moments. Copy the information the CNI-MU Weight and Balance pages onto the Form F, plus
the heading information. A copy of the completed DD Form 365-4 Form F shall be attached to
the flight plan, or given to the controlling ground agency, quality assurance, transient alert,
maintenance, etc.
   5.3.1. DD Form 365-4 Heading. Enter date, mission number, aircraft type, serial number,
   departure and destination station (name or ICAO identifier), home station of aircraft, and
   PIC's rank and last name.
   5.3.2. Limitations Column. Enter the appropriate weight and CG limits for the planned
   mission using the following criteria: the maximum gross weight and center of gravity limits
   specified in TO 1C-130(H)J-1 will not be exceeded. Gross weights may also be limited by
   operating conditions (i.e., obstacle clearance, rate of climb, weather conditions, altitude,
   runway/taxiway bearing capacity, or any other published restrictions.) The PIC will inform
   the LM of any gross weight restrictions prior to mission planning so an accurate ACL may be
   obtained.
       5.3.2.1. Takeoff. Unless other restrictions are imposed, 164,000 lbs is the maximum
       weight for takeoff on the HC-130J.
       5.3.2.2. Landing. Unless other landing restrictions such as assault landings are imposed,
       164,000 lbs is the maximum weight for landing on the HC-130J. Subtract operating
       weight plus estimated landing fuel (references 9 and 23). Refer to the TO 1C-130(H)J-1
       for assault landing limitations.
       5.3.2.3. Limiting Wing Fuel. The CNI-MU is the primary method to compute Limiting
       Wing Fuel. The limiting wing fuel chart in TO 1C-130(H)J-1 is based on a 2.5 G
       maneuver load factor with indicated airspeed restrictions outlined in area "C" of the flight
       manual limitation charts. Specific mission requirements exceeding area "C" limitations
       must be computed using the appropriate flight manual weight limitation charts
AFI11-2HC-130JV3_ADDENDA-A 3 OCTOBER 2012                                                     43


   5.3.3. Permissible C.G. Takeoff and Landing. Compute the forward and aft center of gravity
   limitations using the center of gravity table in the appropriate TO 1C-130(H)J-5-2. Leave the
   block entitled "Permissible CG Zero Fuel Wt" blank.
   5.3.4. Signature Blocks:
       5.3.4.1. Computed by: Signature, rank, and organization on original and duplicate.
       5.3.4.2. Weight and Balance Authority: Leave blank
       5.3.4.3. Pilot: Signature, rank, and organization on original and duplicate.
5.4. Instructions For Form F. Copy the information from data entered in the CNI-MU Weight
and Balance pages and handwrite, type, or computer generate a copy of the DD Form 365-4.
NOTE: In the remarks section, enter a breakdown of takeoff fuel weight for each tank to the
nearest 100 pounds and moments using the CNI-MU. NOTE: During engine running onloads
or when planned ground times require, a combined load C/B may be used if a validated load plan
is presented, and the aircraft is loaded per the load plan.
   5.4.1. Compute and enter zero fuel weight and zero fuel moment by zeroing out the Take-
   Off and Landing fuels on the Fuel page. Return to the main weight and balance page to
   calculate the Take-off and Landing Zero Fuel Weight. After calculations have been entered
   return to the fuel page and return the fuel to its original state. Zero fuel percent of MAC is
   not required, but may be helpful when targeting a 20-22 zero fuel percent of MAC.
   5.4.2. Reference 22. If required, subtract airdrop load weight and moment from reference 21
   or changes in corrections column and enter as adjusted zero fuel weight/moment on first
   blank line in reference 22. First blank line title will read, ―ADJ ZFW/M‖.
   5.4.3. . Use the following criteria to compute fuel burn off when flight plan fuel weights are
   not available. (PPH = pounds per hour.)
       5.4.3.1. 4,000 PPH - normal flight at altitude.
       5.4.3.2. 5,000 PPH - first hour of flight (climb out) or low level.

Associate and Unit Equipped.
Allowable Cabin Load (ACL)—The maximum payload that can be carried on an individual
sortie.
Director, Mobility Forces (DIRMOBFOR)—In overseas theaters, the DIRMOBFOR is
normally responsible for theater mobility force management. The Air Force component
commander exercises operational control of assigned or attached mobility forces through the
DIRMOBFOR. The DIRMOBFOR monitors and manages assigned mobility forces operating in
theater.
Distinguished Visitor (DV)—Passengers, including those of friendly nations, of star or flag rank
or equivalent status to include diplomats, cabinet members, members of Congress, and other
individuals designated by the DoD due to their mission or position (includes BLUE BARK and
COIN ASSIST).
