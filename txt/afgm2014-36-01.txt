      CAREER INTERMISSION PILOT PROGRAM (CIPP) GUIDANCE
This Guidance Memorandum directs the collection of information protected by the Privacy Act of
1974. The authority to collect and maintain the prescribed records in this Guidance Memorandum
are Title 10, United States Code (USC), Section (§) 8013, and the Secretary of the Air Force
(SECAF).

Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this Guidance Memorandum are
maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and
disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

Requirements for this program may change based on needs identified by DCS, Manpower,
Personnel, and Services (AF/A1) and the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) in coordination with
AF/RE and NGB/CF. This Guidance Memorandum may be supplemented at any level, but all
publications that directly implement this Guidance Memorandum must be routed to AF/A1 for
coordination prior to certification and approval.

1. Purpose. CIPP provides a one-time, temporary transition from active duty to the Individual
Ready Reserve (IRR) for officer and enlisted Airmen to meet personal or professional needs outside
the service while providing a mechanism for seamless return to active duty. The long-term intent of
this program is to retain the valuable experience and training of top performing Airmen that might
otherwise be lost by permanent separation. It provides an avenue to meet the changing needs of
today’s service members. This work-life flexibility initiative will enable the USAF to retain talent
which reduces cost and adverse impacts on the mission. This program targets top performing
Airmen.

2. Background. The FY09 NDAA, Section 533 of Public Law 110-417, authorizes the armed
forces in the Department of Defense (DOD) to establish a pilot program under which officer and
enlisted Airmen may be inactivated from active duty with a corresponding appointment or
enlistment in the IRR for periods of up to three years, while retaining certain active duty benefits,
and be returned to active duty at the end of the inactive duty period. FY12 NDAA, Section 531 of
Public Law 112-81, extended CIPP authority through 31 Dec 2015 and FY13 NDAA, Section 522
of Public Law 112-239, expanded eligibility to active Guard and Reserve members. All CIPP
Airmen must return to active duty no later than 31 Dec 2018 or within 3 years from entry into CIPP,
whichever comes first.

3. Program Scope. This program provides the following authority:

       3.1. Allow officers and enlisted Airmen (20 each per year through Calendar Year (CY) 15)
       to transition from active duty into the IRR for a period generally from one year not to exceed
       three years. All CIPP Airmen are obligated to return to active duty at the end of their period
       of IRR participation.


                                                                                                    2
       3.2. Allow the USAF to adjust the Date of Rank (DOR) of an officer or enlisted Airmen
       upon return to active duty.

       3.3 Allow the USAF to terminate participation in CIPP and order Airmen to return to active
       duty in case of national emergency, critical mission needs or state emergency.

       3.5. Exclude CIPP Airmen from promotion consideration while participating in the
       program.

       3.6. Provide military medical and dental care for CIPP Airmen and their eligible dependents
       as if the Airman was on active duty for a period of more than 30 consecutive days under the
       provisions of Chapter 55 of Title 10, USC as authorized in FY09 NDAA, Section 533 of
       Public Law 110-417.

       3.7. Provide disability evaluation system (DES) processing and compensation as if the
       Airman was on active duty for a period of more than 30 consecutive days under the
       provisions of Chapter 61 of Title 10, USC as authorized in the FY13 NDAA, Section 522 of
       Public Law 112-239.

           to sell back a portion of their remaining leave balance, the payment will count

    HOS to their follow-on assignment upon return to active duty. An allowance will be paid

    for any travel costs incurred for any administrative or medical processing required for return

       pay and allowances will be the Airman’s extended active duty (EAD) date.

       reinstatement of all Chapter 5, Title 37, USC special or incentive pays or bonuses to which

       bonus is still authorized at the time of return.

              8.6.1. If the CIPP Airman is no longer eligible for special or incentive pay or bonus,

              must be reviewed to determine whether the Airman is subject to the requirements for
              repayment of any portion of such pay or bonus.

       8.7. Qualification and Proficiency in AFSC upon return to active duty. As appropriate,
