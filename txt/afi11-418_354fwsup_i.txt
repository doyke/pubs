1. General.
   1.1. The basic supervision structure for flying operations consists of the Operations Group
   Commander (OG/CC), the Supervisor of Flying (SOF) and the squadron supervisors, i.e.,
   Operations Supervisor (Ops Sup, also referred to as Top 3).
   1.2. The chain of supervision begins with the OG/CC, through the SOF, down to the
   individual squadron supervisors. The requirements for each position are specified in para 3.
   Specific duties and responsibilities are defined throughout this instruction.
   1.3. For the purpose of this instruction “experienced” is used in accordance with (IAW) the
   definition provided in the Mission Design Series (MDS) specific AFI 11-2MDS Volume 1.
      1.3.1. For the purposes of this instruction only, aircrews are also considered
      “experienced” when previously rated “experienced” in another MDS or previously rated
      “experienced” in a different crew position in the same MDS. These individuals must then
      be selected by the Squadron CC and approved by the OG/CC for operations supervision
      responsibilities.
      1.3.2. Where no definition is provided, “experienced” will be determined by the unit
      squadron commander and approved by OG/CC.
2. Functions:
   2.1. SOF. When on duty, the SOF is a group-level position and is the direct representative of
   the OG/CC. The SOF is the focal point for command and control of flight operations. OG/CC
   decision authority is delegated to this position to accomplish the mission.
 4                                            AFI11-418_354FWSUP_I 10 SEPTEMBER 2013


        2.1.1. SOF is not required for rescue/weather/electronic attack/airlift/air refueling/special
        operations/deployed U-2 Ops. (For C2ISR, the OG/CC will determine if a SOF program
        is required. If a program is established this Instruction applies. At a minimum, C2ISR
        units will establish an Ops Sup/Top 3 program.)
     2.2. Ops Sup/Top 3. The squadron Ops Sup/Top 3 will only be filled by the following
     individuals: the squadron commander, the squadron operations officer, assistant operations
     officer(s), flight commanders, or other individuals deemed qualified by the squadron
     commander and approved by the OG/CC. ANG/AFRC: OG/CC or Air Operations Officer
     (AOO) will determine requirements for Ops Sup and will determine the appropriate
     personnel to fill the Ops Sup position. ANG/AFRC may combine SOF and Ops Sup duties.
        2.2.1. Squadron commander and operations officer decision authority may be delegated
        to this position to make operations-related decisions and recommendations.
3. Operations. This section identifies the minimum flying unit supervisory requirements
depending on types of operations involved. (Additional requirements can be defined in the unit
supplement).
     3.1. Types of Operations. The definitions for types of operations that are used in Table 1
     are:
        3.1.1. Daily Flying Operations. Normal or surge operations at the unit's home station
        (this does not include other types of operations defined below).
        3.1.2. On-Going Off Station Sorties. Missions/sorties that do not takeoff or land at
        home station.
        3.1.3. Deployed Operations. Flight operations away from home station that are part of
        a deployment, exercise or contingency.
        3.1.4. Scrambles. Aircraft launched on a scramble order from an alert posture.
     3.2. Minimum Supervision Requirements. These are outlined in Table 1 for each type of
     operation.

Notes:
   1. The SOF and Ops Sup may leave the unit operations complex (as defined by the unit
      supplement to this instruction) after aircraft depart the local area, workload permitting
      and will be immediately available by telephone, pager, radio or intercom. The SOF and
      Ops Sup will be at their duty locations 45 minutes prior to the estimated time of arrival of
      unit aircraft. For reduced flying operations the OG/CC may determine if a SOF is
      required. Reduced flying operations are defined as 4 or less fighter aircraft or 2 or less of
      the same type of non-fighter aircraft or, while adhering to these limitations for fighter and
      non-fighter aircraft, 6 total aircraft if 2 or more are RPA.
   (354FW) An FCF requires a SOF. During normal flying periods, the SOF will be in the
   primary duty location. The Operations Supervisor may act as the SOF from the operations
   desk during reduced flying operations if they are SOF qualified and have radio
   communication capability with the FCF pilot.
   (354FW) Duty location for the Ops Sup is within the squadron building and immediately
   available to the operations desk during flying operations. Ops Sup will coordinate with
   SARMs to ensure the operations desk is continuously monitored. If required to leave the
   building during flying operations, Ops Sup will handoff responsibilities to another qualified
   Ops Sup.
   2. For deployed operations, the detachment commander will coordinate with host base
      Operations Group for supervision requirements. This may involve integrating into the
      host base SOF and/or Ops Sup program.

   3. Must be immediately available by telephone, pager, radio, or intercom. (USAFE: Ops
      Sup for on-going off station sorties can be filled by an experienced aircrew member
      (SDO) as defined in the unit supplement.)

AFI11-418_354FWSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                         9


5. Handling of In-Flight Emergencies:
   5.1. The primary objective during an abnormal/emergency situation is the safe recovery of
   the aircrew and aircraft. When establishing procedures, units will consider:
      5.1.1. Providing a single, discrete frequency for recovering an emergency aircraft. ATC
      and the emergency aircrew should determine when to use a single frequency approach
      (SFA). The SOF will have access to the SFA. The SFA should be available to
      crash/fire/rescue personnel to monitor the recovery.
      5.1.2. Using the command post, or other capable agency, to notify all appropriate
      agencies and key personnel of an IFE and provide situation updates.
      5.1.3. Prioritizing actions during concurrent emergencies/abnormal situations.
      5.1.4. Authorizing direct communications (over discrete SOF or squadron common
      frequency) from the Ops Sup/Top 3 to an IFE aircrew. NOTE: Only ATC personnel may
      authorize direct communication over ATC frequencies, including the SFA frequency.
      However, this does not preclude the SOF and/or Ops Sup/Top 3 from using whatever
      communication necessary, to include GUARD and SFA, to prevent an unsafe situation
      that could immediately jeopardize safe recovery.
      5.1.5. That only the ground on-scene commander, normally the fire chief, can terminate
      an emergency.
      5.1.6. That the final decision during any IFE/abnormal situation rests with the aircraft
      commander. However, SOFs may declare an IFE for any aircraft based on their
      knowledge of the aircraft and the flight and airfield environment.
      5.1.7. Obtaining a chase ship for single ship emergency aircraft if time permits.
      5.1.8. If the SOF is not qualified in or technically knowledgeable of the aircraft with an
      IFE, then directing the Ops Sup/Top 3 or other highly experienced individual to report to
      the SOF's duty location during an abnormal situation/recovery if time permits.
6. SOF Guidance. Unless noted otherwise, this guidance applies to the Ops Sup/Top 3 when a
SOF is either unavailable or not used.
   6.1. SOF/ATC Relationship:
      6.1.1. The separation and sequencing of traffic are the responsibilities of ATC. Unless
      safety is an issue, the SOF will work directly with the watch supervisor. To promote
      effective and efficient flight operations, the SOF may suggest, based on knowledge of the
      flying schedule and unique circumstances of individual missions, actions that affect ATC
      concerns or desires.
      6.1.2. Except in an emergency, the SOF will not transmit over ATC frequencies without
      prior coordination with ATC (this does not apply to dedicated SOF frequencies). All
      radio transmissions to a distressed aircrew, from other than the SOF or ATC, will be
      coordinated through the SOF (this does not apply to the Ops Sup/Top3 if communicating
      to the aircrew via a squadron common frequency).

  6.2. Duty Hours:
     6.2.1. Prior to beginning supervisory duties, the SOF will meet crew rest requirements as
     directed by AFI 11-202 Volume 3, General Flight Rules, as supplemented.
     6.2.2. Maximum duty day for SOF is 16 hours with a limit of 12 hours performing SOF
     duties. The OG/CC is waiver authority and may extend a SOF duty day up to 16 hours
     on a case-by-case basis. (AFGSC Missile Wings: For alert and scramble operations, the
     SOF maximum duty day is 24 hrs as long as alert/sleeping facilities are readily available).
        6.2.2.1. (Added-354FW) SOF tours will normally be limited to 8 hours. SQ/DO
        may approve SOF tours scheduled up to 10 hours without an OG/CC waiver. For any
        SOF tour that will exceed 10 hours, an OG/CC waiver is required.
     6.2.3. The SOF will be at the prescribed duty location IAW Table 1 NLT 30 minutes
     prior to first takeoff in order to complete required duties in paragraph 4.3
        6.2.3.1. (Added-354FW) The SOF will report to the base of the tower for duty NLT
        1+30 (hours + minutes) prior to the first scheduled takeoff to receive a weather
        briefing and perform an airfield inspection; and occupy the primary or alternate duty
        location 0+50 prior. The SOF will pick up the FM radio and SOF truck keys from
        354 OSS/OSAM.
        6.2.3.2. (Added-354FW) During Cold Weather Operations (normally 15 Oct – 15
        Apr, IAW 354FWI 11-250), the SOF will report to the base of the tower NLT 2+00
        prior, and occupy the primary or alternate duty location 1+00 prior.
  6.3. Duty Location:
     6.3.1. Primary Duty Location. The primary duty location for active duty units will be
     in the control tower. (AFGSC Missile Wings: the primary duty location will be
     designated by the OG/CC).
     6.3.2. Alternate Duty Location. The OG/CC will designate alternate duty locations in
     the unit supplement to this instruction. As a minimum, the location must have adequate
     communication equipment and the capability to monitor weather conditions. It is
     desirable to have a SOF duty position from which ground operations, takeoffs, landings
     and local traffic patterns can be observed. The following is a list of recommended
     alternate locations:
        6.3.2.1. The SOF vehicle on the airfield.
        6.3.2.2. The runway monitoring unit (RMU)/runway supervisory unit (RSU).
        6.3.2.3. The unit dispatch desk.
        6.3.2.4. The command post.
     6.3.3. At both the primary and alternate duty locations the SOF will have timely access
     to a SOF vehicle and the airfield environment when required. AFRC: units are not
     required to have a dedicated vehicle for the SOF, but must be provided access to a
     vehicle to perform required duties in a timely manner.
        6.3.3.1. (Added-354FW) The alternate SOF location is the SOF truck which is
        parked at the base of the tower when not in use. The SOF will carry the “Hit and Run
AFI11-418_354FWSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                          11


        Kit” and use the FM radio to communicate with the 354 OG/CC and 354 FW
        Command Post as required. If the SOF is operating out of an alternate location other
        than the SOF truck, the SOF keeps OG/CC and CP advised of location and contact
        information.
  6.4. Equipment:
     6.4.1. The following communication equipment must be functional and immediately
     available to the SOF:
        6.4.1.1. A dedicated multi-frequency radio (UHF, VHF and/or HF, as appropriate
        based on supported aircraft capabilities).
        6.4.1.2. A telephone (land-line or cellular telephone) or FM radio to contact the
        OG/CC (or designated representative), command post, Ops Sups, weather facility and
        ATC watch supervisors. Dedicated phone lines (hot-lines) are preferred.
        6.4.1.3. (Added-354FW) SOFs noting any problems or deficiencies applicable to
        SOF facilities, forms (i.e., FCIFs, publications, etc.) or equipment will notify 354
        OG/OGV telephonically via 377-1801. If unable to reach OGV, use an email to relay
        the information. Time permitting; the SOF will attempt to resolve the issue. In
        addition to these actions, SOFs will document equipment deficiencies on their daily
        SOF events log.
     6.4.2. Access to approved weather resources will be available (net-centric data
     dissemination system, etc).
     6.4.3. Units are required to have a dedicated SOF vehicle immediately available to the
     SOF and positioned to respond to emergencies, perform airfield inspections, or other
     official functions. This vehicle must have a flight line clearance and be equipped with a
     multi-channel radio capable of contacting unit aircraft and ATC. Waiver authority for this
     requirement is the Wing Commander or equivalent.
     6.4.4. Locally developed checklists will be available to outline procedures for normal
     and emergency situations that included, as a minimum, the items listed in Attachment 2.
        6.4.4.1. (Added-354FW) The SOF checklist contains all locally developed
        checklists for normal, upgrade and emergency procedures. A copy of the SOF
        checklist will be available in the primary and alternate duty locations as well as the 18
        AGRS operations desk.
     6.4.5. Dedicated binoculars will be immediately available for SOF use when either in the
     primary or alternate duty location for a clear view of the runway.
     6.4.6. A SOF library will be available (either hard copy or electronic as outlined in the
     unit supplement to this instruction) that includes applicable directives and instructions (to
     include AF, HHQ, and local guidance), aircraft TOs, checklists, in-flight guides, and SOF
     read/information file.
        6.4.6.1. (Added-354FW) 354 OG/OGV maintains the SOF Read Files, SOF
        checklist, T.O. 1F-16C-1, T.O. 1F-16C-1CL, T.O. 1F-16C-34-1-1CL, AFI 11-418,

         Supplement, and applicable flight information publications in the tower. The medium
         for this library is a combination of electronic and hardcopy format.
     6.4.7. If the SOF must reposition to an alternate location, the minimum essential
     equipment outlined in this section will be available at this new location (pre-positioned or
     transported).
         6.4.7.1. (Added-354FW) Prior to departing the primary location, the SOF will grab
         the “Hit and Run Kit” which contains a hard copy of all items listed in para. 6.4.6.1
         along with a pair of binoculars. The SOF will also bring along the dedicated FM
         radio.

     proven maturity, judgment and supervisory ability and must be combat mission ready
     (CMR) or basic mission capable (BMC) in a unit aircraft
         6.5.1.1. Non-CMR (N-CMR)/non-BMC (N-BMC) aircrew members may perform
         SOF duties at the discretion of the OG/CC on the condition that the status must be
         temporary in nature and all SOF currencies must be maintained IAW paragraph 6.7.
     6.5.2. To gain initial certification, all SOFs will complete the SOF upgrade program
     IAW paragraph 6.6.
     6.5.3. SOFs that are currently under a Duties Not Involving Flying (DNIF) status may
     perform SOF duties when specifically cleared by a flight surgeon on an AF Form 1042.
     6.5.4. Loss of SOF certification will occur for any of the following reasons:
         6.5.4.1. PCS or 179/365 day TDYs (unless the individual is performing SOF duties
         and able to retain currency while TDY).
         6.5.4.2. Direct action by the OG/CC through a written statement in the individuals
         training folder and removal from the unit “Letter of Xs” or equivalent document. Any
         supervisor may recommend action to the OG/CC for the removal of an individual’s
         SOF certification.
     6.5.5. The source documents for certifying SOF certifications are the OG/CC-signed
     approval document in the individual’s training folder and the unit “Letter of Xs” or
     equivalent document.
     6.5.6. Units will define who is certified to upgrade other aircrew members to SOF in the
     unit supplement to this instruction.
         6.5.6.1. (Added-354FW) Current and qualified SOFs are certified to upgrade SOFs.
  6.6. Certification Program:
     6.6.1. Documentation of the unit upgrade program will be described in the unit
     supplement to this instruction, but will, at a minimum, include a signed document by the
     OG/CC kept in the individuals training folder that approves him/her for SOF duties.
     Additionally, upon completion of the upgrade flow, the unit “Letter of Xs” or equivalent
     document will be updated to reflect the SOF certification.
AFI11-418_354FWSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                      13


        6.6.1.1. (Added-354FW) The SOF Training/Certification checklist is located in
        Attachment 5. This checklist serves as the record of nomination along with tracking
        the accomplishment of all required items. Upon completion, the OG/CC will sign the
        checklist certifying the individual as SOF qualified. Squadron training shops will
        update the Letter of Xs and maintain this checklist within the individual’s gradebook.
        6.6.1.2. (Added-354FW) Nominees have 30 days to complete the program from the
        initiation of the OGV briefing. If the upgrade is not accomplished in 30 days, the
        OG/OGV briefing and SOF test (if completed) will both be re-accomplished.
     6.6.2. Squadron commanders will screen and review (IAW para. 6.5.) all SOF candidates
     before nominating them for entry into the upgrade program.
     6.6.3. All SOF candidates will receive an interview and briefing from the OG/CC on
     responsibilities, personal philosophy and expectations. OG/CCs will emphasize the SOFs
     position as a group level supervisor and that decision authority is delegated to the SOF
     position to ensure the safe accomplishment of the mission.
     6.6.4. The SOF upgrade will consist of two supervised tours of two hours each
     (minimum of 4 hours of training time) with a current and experienced SOF, as defined in
     the unit supplement. The tours will be conducted on two different days in order to
     maximize the chances of the upgradee to observe differing wind and weather conditions.
     Upgradees will act as primary SOF on their second upgrade tour. The upgrade tours must
     include the following:
        6.6.4.1. Familiarization with airfield/heliport procedures, primary and alternate duty
        locations, and local support agencies with emphasis on both unit and aircraft-specific
        operating procedures (AF, HHQ, and local), specifically capabilities and limitations.
        6.6.4.2. Operation of all SOF equipment and radios.
        6.6.4.3. Contact procedures for aircraft and support agencies.

     6.6.6. The OG/CC will review upgradee training records and approve each upgradee in
     writing prior to the individual performing SOF duties.
     6.6.7. For previously certified SOFs, the OG/CC may waive the upgrade requirements of
     these paragraphs, but at a minimum, the upgradee will perform at least one supervised
     SOF tour with an experienced SOF with emphasis on local procedures. EXCEPTION:
     SOFs who have lost certification due to N-CMR/N-BMC status IAW para. 6.5.1.2, but
     still have currency IAW para. 6.7. In this case, the SQ/CC must ensure that the unit
     “Letter of Xs” or equivalent document is updated appropriately before the individual
     performs SOF duties.
        6.6.7.1. (Added-354FW) The SQ/CC may waive the first SOF upgrade tour for
        individuals previously qualified as a SOF. In this instance, the upgrading SOF will
        act as primary SOF during the second tour.
  6.7. Currency/Recurrency.

     certified SOFs (highly encouraged for Ops Sups/Top 3s). OG/CCs will be involved in
     developing meeting agendas. If unable to attend, SOFs will review meeting minutes that
     will be posted to the SOF readfile prior to their next SOF duty.
        6.8.1.1. (Added-354FW) OGV will hold semi-annual SOF meetings prior to
        entering and exiting cold weather operations (normally 15 Oct – 15 April).
        Preferably, these meetings are held within the first week of Oct/Apr respectively.
        6.8.1.2. (Added-354FW) These meetings will cover recent trends along with the
        unique environmental concerns for the upcoming season.
     6.8.2. Annually, all SOFs are required to review applicable SOF guidance and directives
     as published in this instruction, unit supplement, and the SOF readfile. Additionally all
     SOFs will receive a briefing from the OG/CC on responsibilities, expectations and
     commander perspective (this briefing may be held as part of a semi-annual meeting). If
AFI11-418_354FWSUP_I 6 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                          15

          be covered during the spring semi-annual SOF meeting.
   6.9. Program Administration:
      6.9.1. The OG/CC will designate an Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for the
      administration of the program.
          6.9.1.1. (Added-354FW) 354 OG/OGV is the OPR for the administration of the 354
          FW SOF Program.
      6.9.2. The OPR will:
          6.9.2.1. Develop and administer the SOF initial training program.
          6.9.2.2. Develop and administer the SOF certification test. This is a controlled test of
          at least 25 questions that will be updated and reviewed annually.
          6.9.2.3. If not retained by the squadron in individual training folders, the OPR will
          retain all original initial certification and continuation training records until the
          individual PCSs to their next assignment.
          6.9.2.4. Establish standardized procedures throughout the unit for monitoring SOF
          currencies and continuation training requirements (ARMS preferred).
          6.9.2.5. Schedule and give semi-annual SOF meetings.

   8.6. Procedures for how deployed units will integrate into host unit operations supervision
   structure.
      8.6.1. (Added-354FW) TDY units will be scheduled to cover SOF positional duties, if
      applicable, during normal flying operations to include: Distant Frontier (DF), Red Flag
      (RF) and other Major/Large Force Exercises (MFE/LFE); however, only the 18 AGRS
      SOFs will be scheduled to open.
          8.6.1.1. (Added-354FW) TDY unit SOFs must be qualified IAW AFI 11-418 and
          posses a Flightline Drivers License/Certificate.
          8.6.1.2. (Added-354FW) Prior to accomplishing SOF duties at Eielson AFB, TDY
          SOFs will fill out and accomplish all training on Attachment 6. TDY units will
          submit completed checklists to 354 OG/OGV. OGV will only maintain these forms
          for the length of the unit’s TDY.

  8.7. Procedures (pager, phone, radio, etc.) for base C2 personnel to contact unit supervision
  during flying operations.
     8.7.1. (Added-354FW) During all home-station flying operations, the 354 OG/CC can
     be contacted via OG hotline, cell phone or FM radio. Squadron Supervision can be
     contacted via the squadron duty desk. If contact is required after duty hours (example:
     off station flights / deployment operations) 354 OG/CC, AGRS/CC or DO may be
     reached through 354 FW Command Post @ DSN 318-377-1500 / Commercial: 907-377-
     1500. Additionally, a phone list of all base C2 personnel is located in the SOF checklist.

9. Special provisions for ANG/AFRC and smaller than wing-sized units (e. g. GSUs).
   9.1. If a unit operates from a location with another organization (i.e., tenant unit), integration
   into host unit supervisory program should be attempted if operations are compatible. These
   procedures will be implemented through LOAs/MOAs.
   9.2. At the discretion of the OG/CC (or equivalent), more than one supervisory position may
   be covered by a single supervisor. The responsibilities of the SOF position take priority over
   all other duties and a single Ops Sup will be SOF certified.
