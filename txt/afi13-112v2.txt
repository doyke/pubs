                             PROGRAM RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Introduction. The provisions of this instruction apply to those operational organizations
within Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), Air
National Guard (ANG), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), and United States Air Forces in Europe
(USAFE) that have individual Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC) assigned, are tasked to
execute close air support (CAS) missions in support of ground forces and are authorized IAW
AFI 13-112 Volume 1 Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) Training program. The purpose
of the JTAC Standardization/Evaluation (Stan/Eval) program is to provide commanders a tool to
validate JTAC readiness and the effectiveness of unit operations, including documentation of
individual JTAC qualifications and capabilities.
   1.1.1. Standardization. Standardization ensures that common JTAC training programs
   support combat air operations based upon proven tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP)
   and are in accordance with established safety standards. When administered in a consistent
   manner using prescribed performance standards, evaluations ensure that individual JTACs
   achieve and maintain their combat mission ready (CMR) status in accordance with (IAW)
   AFI 13-112 Volume 1.
   1.1.2. Evaluation. Individual JTAC evaluations emphasize combat scenarios that are based
   upon the mission identification and operation plans (OPLAN) specified in the unit’s
   Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statement, and probable contingency taskings. CAS
   missions evaluated IAW this instruction and the group’s and/or unit’s operating instructions
   (OIs) use TTPs applicable to combat scenarios (e.g., OPORDs, appropriate use of code
   words, authentication procedures, combat tactics, tactical deception and concealment, threat
   reactions, intelligence briefing/debriefing, and battle damage assessment reports). To the
   maximum extent practical, JTAC evaluations use joint training exercises and include the use
   of artillery or mortar fire support, threat simulators, countermeasures, and target marking
   techniques.
1.2. Program Overview. The JTAC Stan/Eval Program provides commanders and staffs
meaningful indicators reflecting a unit’s ability to accomplish its peacetime training and combat
responsibilities.
   1.2.1. Commanders are authorized to use an OI in lieu of a supplement, to specify the
   following:
       1.2.1.1. Define any additional unit Stan/Eval section’s individual, organization and
       program responsibilities and/or duties. Include unit’s Chief of Stan/Eval (CSE) and
       Stan/Eval Examiner (SEE) upgrade training program.
       1.2.1.2. Establish procedures and time limits for accomplishing the AF Form 8,
       Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, logging evaluations on the AF Form 942, Record of
       Evaluation.
       1.2.1.3. Define the examination process and management procedures for maintaining and
       administering ground-phase evaluations IAW this instruction.

       1.2.1.4. Identify additional JTAC evaluation requirements and the establishment of
       appropriate grading criteria.
       1.2.1.5. Specify the no-notice evaluation process.
       1.2.1.6. Specify the trend analysis program to include the management of special interest
       items (SIIs) identified by MAJCOM or Numbered Air Forces (NAF), Group, or
       Squadron.
       1.2.1.7. Define the unit’s Stan/Eval        Board     (SEB) process    and    unit-specific
       responsibilities and procedures.
       1.2.1.8. Identify who, in addition to the commander, is authorized to certify the AF Form
       8 and other documentation concerning the Stan/Eval program.
       1.2.1.9. Identify the individual(s) that can verify Go/No-Go status prior to releasing the
       JTAC for any scheduled mission.
    1.2.2. Program Objectives. The Stan/Eval Program must ensure that unit JTAC training
    programs support the successful and safe execution of the unit’s DOC statement missions
    and at unit commander’s discretion, potential taskings outside of a unit’s DOC statement (T-
    3).
       1.2.2.1. Ensure the standardization of operational procedures for terminal attack control
       IAW AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules And Procedures, JP 3-09.3 Close Air Support,
       and AFTTP3-1.MDS publications.
       1.2.2.2. Provide a system to assess individual JTAC qualifications based upon the
       operational training standards defined in AFI 13-112, Volume 1, recognize trends, and
       recommend changes to the JTAC training program, lesson plans, standard operating
       procedures, and governing directives based on results of evaluations.
       1.2.2.3. Ensure that individual JTACs are current, qualified and CMR before controlling
       aircraft without a current, qualified, and CMR JTAC being present.
       1.2.2.4. Provide a system to assess individual readiness levels.
       1.2.2.5. Ensure unit compliance with operational, training, and administrative directives
       related to JTAC operations.
       1.2.2.6. Provide an after-action review feedback using the Stan/Eval Board process to
       senior, lateral, and subordinate headquarters through cross-command, cross-tell reports.
       1.2.2.7. Enhance flight and ground safety during support of air operations.
       1.2.2.8. Standardize administrative procedures for documenting individual JTAC
       qualifications.
    1.2.3. Automated Products. The use of automated products (e.g., spreadsheets, databases,
    word processing), to support the requirements of this AFI, is authorized for items not
    included in a MAJCOM/NGB-directed product. The locally developed product must be
    approved by the group commander (T-3). Automated products will be included in an
    individual’s JTAC training and evaluation folder upon PCA, PCS, or TDY deployments in
    support of exercises and contingencies (may be current copies of the products) (T-1).
AFI13-112V2 25 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                   7

       2.1) initially and in conjunction with the recurring JTAC evaluation thereafter (T-3). The
       evaluation will focus on the effectiveness of teaching the trainee(s).
   1.3.9. Individual JTAC Responsibilities. The most important member of the Stan/Eval
   program is the individual JTAC. With few exceptions, the individual JTAC reflects the level
   of instruction and the quality of the unit. Each JTAC will:
       1.3.9.1. Maintain JTAC control currency and qualification requirements IAW this
       instruction and AFI 13-112, Volume 1, and participate only in activities for which current
       when not supervised (T-0).
1.4. Individual JTAC Transfers. Within 30 days of inproccessing into the unit or prior to
executing their first unsupervised mission (whichever comes first), CSE will review Part IV of
the gained/attached JTAC’s training and evaluation folder (T-3). This review will be documented
as a CSE review on the AF Form 942 (T-3). Document minor discrepancies on the minor
discrepancy log and place MFRs on top of the effected AF Form 8 having major discrepancies
(T-3). The CSE is only responsible for correcting discrepancies found on the most recent JTAC,
JTAC-I and SEE AF Form 8s during this review (T-3).
   1.4.1. In the case of transferring to an assignment without a JTAC Stan/Eval program,
   individual JTACs must maintain their JTAC training and evaluation folder until they return
   to a unit with a JTAC Stan/Eval program (T-3). Upon assignment to a unit with a JTAC
   Stan/Eval program, the records must be presented to the gaining unit for maintaining
   documentation IAW this instruction (T-3). For JTACs who are required to maintain currency
   and qualification and are assigned to a unit without a JTAC Stan/Eval program, follow the
   instructions in paragraph 1.6. (T-3).
1.5. JTAC Deployments. Individuals deploying to fill a JTAC requirement must deploy
current on all controls, qualified, and CMR (T-0).
   1.5.1. CMR JTACs who are deployed in support of contingency operations are not required
   to accomplish a recurring JTAC mission evaluation while deployed if their qualification is
   current at the start of the deployment. A JTAC whose evaluation expires while deployed is
   considered unqualified upon completion of the deployment, and must regain JTAC
   qualification via a requalification evaluation upon return to home station (T-0).
1.6. Attachment for JTAC Stan/Eval program management.
   1.6.1. JTACs assigned by PCS/PCA orders to JTAC positions in organizations not having
   JTAC training and/or Stan/Eval program may be attached to units with a JTAC training and
   Stan/Eval program. Intra-group attachments will be approved by the group commander (T-3).
   For attachments that are not intra-group, individuals must request attachment through their
   chain of command to their MAJCOM or equivalent. Approval authority may be delegated,
   as directed by the MAJCOM. The request must include: Individual’s name, rank, expected
   duration of attachment, date of separation (DOS)/expiration of term of service (ETS),
   assigned duty position title/position number, requested unit for attachment, and point of
AFI13-112V2 25 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                              13


   contact for that unit (T-3). Individuals should coordinate JTAC qualification (s), currency
   and attachment with requested unit prior to submitting the formal request.
   1.6.2. For attachments outside an individual’s MAJCOM, submit the request through the
   parent MAJCOM to the supporting MAJCOM (T-2). For individuals external to the USAF
   requiring attachment, submit the request to the attaching unit’s MAJCOM (T-2). For USAF
   only, after attachment is approved, the MAJCOM will grant access to manage the JTAC in
   TACTICS or other approved web based program (T-2).
   1.6.3. JTACs attached to units will have their AF Form 8 signed by the attached unit
   commander or designated representative (T-3). Resources required for JTAC Stan/Eval are
   the responsibility of the assigned unit, not the unit providing the attached support.
1.7. JTACs External to the USAF. There may be situations where JTACs and Forward Air
Controllers (FAC) from other Services or Nations are required to comply with this instruction.
One example would be foreign instructors assigned to a USAF unit conducting a JTAC
Qualification Course.
   1.7.1. External FACs and JTACs must comply with Chapter 2 of this AFI to include
   required evaluations, documentation, JTAC training and evaluation folder, and AF Form 8s.
   These individuals will be considered USAF JTAC instructors once their JTAC mission
   evaluation and any required training has been completed. Any records created will be
   provided to the individual upon change of assignment. For individuals qualified as a
   Forward Air Controller (FAC) or equivalent under STANAG 3797 by their host nation, their
   period of qualification will count towards any JTAC experience requirements.
1.8. Supplements. The MAJCOMs, NAFs, and/or subordinate groups may supplement this
instruction in order to provide specific guidance to their aligned units. The parent MAJCOM
OPR must approve all group and NAF level supplements. AF/A3O-AC will coordinate prior to
publication on all MAJCOM supplements. MAJCOM OPRs will forward all approved
supplements to the other MAJCOMs within 30 days of publication. The NGB will provide a
copy of any approved supplements to their gaining MAJCOM.

                           JTAC EVALUATION PROCEDURES

2.1. Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) Evaluation Requirements. The initial JTAC
evaluation is administered after completing all Mission Qualification Training (MQT) as
outlined in AFI 13-112, Volume 1 (T-3). A recurring evaluation is administered to CMR JTACs
who have successfully completed an initial evaluation (T-0). JTAC evaluations consist of a
ground phase and a control phase. Control-phase evaluations must be conducted using live-fly
Type I or II controls (T-1). The JTAC evaluation completion date entered on the AF Form 8 is
the date the control phase of the evaluation is successfully completed, or the date of the
completion of additional training if assigned (T-3).
2.2. Timing of Evaluations. The JTAC evaluation expires on the last day of the 17th month
following the month the control-phase evaluation was successfully completed (e.g., an evaluation
completed 9 Oct 05 expires 31 Mar 07) (T-0).
   2.2.1. Initial JTAC evaluations. When no eligibility period has been established or a re-
   evaluation is required, the JTAC evaluation must be completed within six (6) months of
   completing MQT (T-3).
   2.2.2. Recurring JTAC mission evaluations. The CSE, or designated representative, will
   schedule recurring JTAC evaluations during the eligibility period (T-0). The evaluation
   eligibility period begins no sooner than the first day of the 12th month after the completion
   date of the previous evaluation and no later than the last day of the 17th month (e.g. a
   completion date of 15 Jan 08, the eligibility period covers 1 Jan 09 through 30 Jun 09) (T-0).
   Additionally, if an expiration date for a recurring JTAC evaluation occurs within 3 months
   after an expected PCS or during a non-contingency TDY of such length that qualifications
   will expire, JTACs must complete their JTAC evaluation before departing, if the PCS or
   TDY requires JTAC qualifications (T-3).
   2.2.3. Failure to complete a JTAC evaluation within the required time period results in an
   individual being classified as unqualified (T-0). Requalification evaluation requirements are
   detailed in para 2.2.7. The individual’s Requalification Evaluation (RQ) AF Form 8 will
   include a comment from the approving official explaining why the recurring evaluation
   window was exceeded or if it was waived. (T-3).
   2.2.4. No-Notice Evaluations. No-Notice evaluations provide the commander a sampling of
   daily JTAC performance and an assessment of the unit’s training effectiveness. No-Notice
   evaluations may be conducted at any time, and will be conducted as directed by the unit
   commander (T-3). The unit commander will annotate a statement directing the No-Notice
   Evaluation on the AF Form 8 approving officials remarks (T-3).
       2.2.4.1. A No-Notice evaluation may update a qualification expiration date provided all
       requirements for the evaluation specified in Table 2.1 and the ground-phase evaluation is
       accomplished . Ground-phase evaluations must be completed within 30 days (3 UTAs
       for ANG) of the control-phase evaluation (T-3). Record the evaluation on AF Form 8 (T-
       1).
AFI13-112V2 25 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    15


     2.2.4.2. If all requirements were not completed, the areas evaluated must be documented
     in the Additional Comments section in Part IV of the AF Form 8 (T-3). This evaluation
     will be classified as a N/N Spot.
     2.2.4.3. If all Ground and Control phase requirements were completed the evaluation
     will be classified as a N/N MSN.
  2.2.5. Instructor (INSTR) Evaluations. JTACs maintaining instructor qualification must
  complete initial and recurring evaluations of their instructional capability using Table 2.1,
  Areas 61-70 (T-0). Recurring instructor evaluations must be completed within the six-month
  eligibility period prior to the expiration date of the current evaluation period (T-3). Instructor
  evaluations will be completed no later than 30 days (3 UTAs for ANG) after the control-
  phase evaluation (T-3), but not to exceed the expiration date of the current evaluation period.
  (T-0). Evaluator will state that instructional abilities were evaluated in paragraph D,
  additional comments section of the AF Form 8 (T-3). A minimum of two JTAC training
  areas must be evaluated and listed on the AF Form 8 (T-3).
     2.2.5.1. To initially qualify as a JTAC instructor, the member must successfully
     complete an initial instructor (INIT INSTR) evaluation (T-0). Accomplish INIT INSTR
     evaluations on actual instructional controls whenever possible. When students are not
     available or mission requirements prevent inclusion of students, another JTAC or the
     evaluator may serve as the student for the purpose of evaluating the examinee’s
     instructional ability. Initial instructor evaluation can occur outside of the JTAC
     evaluation eligibility period.
     2.2.5.2. Recurring evaluation of the ability of member to instruct will be conducted
     during subsequent, recurring JTAC mission evaluation eligibility periods (T-3). The
     rating of Areas 61-70 will not affect the overall grade of the individual’s JTAC mission
     evaluation. The AF Form 8 Mission/Check description for these evaluations will not
     include INSTR as the AF Form 8 aircraft/crew position is already annotated with highest
     qualification demonstrated during the previous evaluation (JTAC-I) (T-3).
     2.2.5.3. If instructor qualification is lost, it may be regained through an instructor
     requalification (RQ INSTR) evaluation. All subsequent instructor evaluations will
     comply with para 2.2.5.2 (T-3).
  2.2.6. Spot Evaluations.       Unit commanders may initiate Spot evaluations, place
  commander’s direction of Spot evaluation within the AF Form 8 approving official’s
  comments. A Spot evaluation is normally limited in scope and usually done outside the
  JTAC’s eligibility period The Spot Evaluation is used to ensure correction of identified
  discrepancies or to check a JTAC’s proficiency. It may be either a field evaluation and/or a
  written examination. A Spot evaluation may be used to update a recurring evaluation if
  conducted within an individual’s eligibility period provided all requirements for the
  evaluation specified in Table 2.1, and the ground-phase evaluation is accomplished. If this
  occurs it will be documented as a recurring MSN evaluation, not a SPOT (T-3).
     2.2.6.1. If all requirements were not completed, the areas evaluated must be documented
     on AF Form 8, follow guidance in paragraph 2.2.4.2 above (T-3). There is no
     requirement for a ground-phase evaluation in these instances.
 16                                                      AFI13-112V2 25 SEPTEMBER 2014


   2.2.7. Requalification Evaluation. An evaluation administered to remedy the loss of
   qualification due to an overall grade of Q3, expiration of a required JTAC evaluation, or loss
   of qualification due to a commander-directed downgrade. A requalification evaluation is not
   used for a failed initial evaluation as no qualification was established. A JTAC re-
   qualification evaluation due to a Q3 must be completed within 90 days of completing the
   appropriate commander directed training (T-3).
2.3. Ground-Phase Evaluation. The ground-phase evaluation consists of a closed-book
examination consisting of 50 questions based upon the MQF and the LPMQF (if used)
(Reference Chapter 3). The examinations will measure the JTAC’s knowledge of applicable
TTPs essential for the safe and effective accomplishment of JTAC duties. Successful completion
of the examination requires a minimum passing score of 86 percent (T-3). All missed questions
must be reviewed and corrected with the evaluator that administered the examination (T-3).
Ground-phase evaluations must be completed within the six-month eligibility period prior to the
expiration date of the current evaluation period (T-3). Ground-phase evaluations will be
completed no later than 30 days (3 UTAs for ANG) after the control-phase evaluation (T-3), but
must not exceed the current eligibility period (T-0).
   2.3.1. Individuals failing the ground-phase evaluation must complete a successful re-test
   within 30 calendar days (3 UTAs for ANG), or prior to the current evaluation expiration date,
   whichever comes first (T-3). A minimum of 24 hours must elapse before a re-examination
   can be administered to allow for an adequate period of study (T-3).
       2.3.1.1. When an individual fails a ground-phase evaluation, the evaluator will notify the
       unit commander verbally or in writing (T-3). Individuals failing the ground-phase
       evaluation will be placed in “Supervised Status” until the examination is successfully
       completed (T-3).
       2.3.1.2. Re-examinations will be accomplished using a different exam (T-3). Re-
       examinations will be generated so that a duplication of the original exam questions is
       kept to a minimum (T-3). Unit commander will be notified of successful ground-phase
       evaluation completion (T-3).
       2.3.1.3. If the examinee fails the second ground-phase evaluation, the unit commander
       will identify the examinee as unqualified and document the ground-phase failure on the
       AF Form 8 (T-3). It is the unit commander’s responsibility to determine required training
       actions (i.e. training program, training timeline, etc.). This training will be documented
       on AF Form 8 in Part IV in the Recommended Training section (T-3).
       2.3.1.4. Personnel will not be administered the ground-phase evaluation prior to
       completing MQT IAW paragraph 2.1 of this AFI (T-3). Personnel in MQT status who
       receive a Q-3 on the control-phase of their initial evaluation must complete another
       ground-phase evaluation after any specified additional training is completed (T-3).
   2.3.2. Ground-phase evaluation documentation Procedures. SEEs will enter the date and
   results of the written examination in the “Ground Phase” section in Part II of the AF Form 8
   (T-1). All missed/reviewed questions are entered in Part IV - Remarks, IAW paragraph A4.5
   (T-3). Stan/Eval will retain the scored answer sheets/computer record until the AF Form 8 is
   completed and signed by the unit commander (T-3). If a second examination is required to
AFI13-112V2 25 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    17


   successfully complete the ground phase, the results of both ground-phase evaluations will be
   documented in the proper front and back sections of the AF Form 8 (T-3).
2.4. Control-Phase Evaluation. The purpose of the JTAC control-phase evaluation is to ensure
individual JTACs can skillfully perform the tasks associated with planning, preparation,
execution, and assessment for conducting CAS missions in a combat environment. Areas 31-33
in Table 2.1, JTAC Evaluation Tasks, may be evaluated in a Joint Fire Support Executive
Steering Committee (JFS ESC) accredited and ACC/A3F approved simulator.
   2.4.1. Only live-fly Type 1 and 2 controls are authorized to satisfy the control-phase JTAC
   mission evaluation (T-1).
   2.4.2. The evaluation’s focus will be on the examinee’s ability to accomplish a given
   mission and not a validation of all training received (T-3). Prior to beginning the JTAC
   control-phase evaluation, evaluators will brief the examinee on (T-3):
       2.4.2.1. Evaluation objectives, areas to be evaluated, grading criteria, safety, and
       emergency procedures/SEE takeover (T-3).
       2.4.2.2. Role players and any assistants participating in the mission scenario and what
       their capabilities/limitations will be (T-3).
       2.4.2.3. The mission scenario, preliminary planning information and directions
       applicable to the local range’s operations (T-3).
   2.4.3. The evaluator will observe and evaluate the JTAC in all required area tasks and any
   unit established required areas (T-3). Any break in dates that occur during the JTAC’s
   control-phase evaluation will be noted by the evaluator in the mission description section of
   the AF Form 8 (T-3).
   2.4.4. Examinees must be capable of performing their JTAC duties (T-0).                Assistance
   provided to prevent mission failure will result in a “U” rating for that area (T-0).
       2.4.4.1. The examinee is responsible for the actions of any assistant(s) for procedural
       errors/omissions and safety violations.
   2.4.5. Evaluation scenarios will include the use of input scripts (i.e. OPORD), graphics, and
   an air tasking order (ATO) with special instructions (SPINS) (T-3).
   2.4.6. Failure to Pass the control phase. If a certified JTAC fails the control-phase
   evaluation, a RQ evaluation must be completed no later than 90 days after completing all
   additional training identified during the failed control phase (see paragraph 2.4.7.2 of this
   AFI) (T-3). ANG units will accomplish a RQ evaluation no later than the third UTA
   following the date of the failure (T-3). A different SEE, if available, should conduct the RQ
   evaluation. RQ evaluations may be administered as early as the next calendar day. Ground-
   phase evaluations that were valid for a failed control-phase evaluation remain valid, and do
   not need to be re-accomplished if the RQ Evaluation is completed in the original evaluation
   eligibility period. Annotate previous results of the ground phase on the RQ AF Form 8. RQ
   evaluations outside of the eligibility period require a new ground phase (T-3).
       2.4.6.1. Notify the unit commander verbally or in writing when an individual receives an
       overall “Q-3” (IAW paragraph 2.5.2.4) on any evaluation (T-3). The following
       restrictions apply:
18                                                     AFI13-112V2 25 SEPTEMBER 2014


         2.4.6.1.1. Initial Evaluations. Individual will remain in supervised status until
         successfully evaluated (T-0). The SEE evaluating the individual’s control phase will
         determine what additional training is required prior to a new initial evaluation (T-3).
         Initial evaluations will be completed in accordance with paragraph 2.2.1 (T-3).
         2.4.6.1.2. Recurring Evaluations.     Place examinee on supervised status until
         successfully requalified (T-0).
            2.4.6.1.2.1. JTAC-I and SEEs. JTAC-Is and SEEs receiving an unsatisfactory
            grade “U” in any area in Table 2.1, will not perform instructor or SEE duties until
            successfully requalified (T-0). Items in Table 2.1, Areas 61 through 80 do not
            affect JTAC qualification results.
     2.4.6.2. A RQ mission evaluation that results from a failed control-phase evaluation, is
     successfully completed when the JTAC performs to “Q” criteria for each required graded
     area that was rated a “U.” On RQ evaluations, the unit commander, director of
     operations, or CSE will determine whether all evaluation areas are re-evaluated or just
     those that were graded “U” (T-3).
     2.4.6.3. If the examinee fails the second control-phase evaluation, the unit commander
     will identify the examinee as unqualified and determine what training actions are equired
     (i.e. specific training program, training timeline, etc.) (T-3).
         2.4.6.3.1. JTAC-I and SEEs. JTAC-Is and SEEs receiving a second “U” grade in any
         area in Table 2.1, will lose JTAC-I and SEE status (T-3). Unit commanders will
         remove the individual from these duties in writing (T-3). Items in Table 2.1, Areas
         61 through 80 do not affect JTAC status.
         2.4.6.3.2. Individuals that have been removed from JTAC-I or SEE duties must re-
         accomplish upgrade requirements and satisfactorily complete an RQ JTAC or spot
         SEE evaluation to regain their status (T-3). Unit commanders must reinstate the
         individual to these duties in writing (T-3). If the commander decides not to upgrade
         the individuals, the appropriate SEI must be removed from their personnel records (T-
         3).
     2.4.6.4. A separate AF Form 8 will be completed for each control-phase evaluation (T-
     3). Control-phase mission data from the “Q-3” AF Form 8 will not be annotated on the
     RQ evaluation’s AF Form 8 (T-3). The passing ground-phase evaluation score will be
     annotated on the RQ evaluation AF Form 8 (T-3).
  2.4.7. Post-Evaluation Procedures. Evaluators will thoroughly debrief the examinee and the
  examinee’s unit leadership (as soon as possible) following the completion of a successful
  evaluation (T-3). Evaluator will debrief with the unit commander and/or designated
  individuals following an evaluation with an overall grade of Q-2 or Q-3 (T-3).
     2.4.7.1. Control-phase evaluation documentation procedures. SEEs enter the type of
     evaluation and date in the “Flight Phase” section in Part II of the AF Form 8. All
     discrepancies are entered in Part IV - Remarks, IAW paragraph A4.5.2.
         2.4.7.1.1. Evaluators may recommend additional training for areas rated as “Q-” and
         will recommend additional training for areas rated as “U” (T-3).
AFI13-112V2 25 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                   19


      2.4.7.2. Any additional training will be accomplished within 30 calendar days (3 UTAs)
      (T-3). If additional training is required, the individual will be placed in supervised status
      until training is completed (T-3). If all additional training is not completed by the due
      date, the individual will remain in supervised status until the additional training is
      accomplished (T-3). The approving official will explain why the training was not
      completed on time in section IV, Approving Officer’s Remarks on the AF Form 8 (T-3).
2.5. Evaluation Grading System. During a JTAC’s evaluation, grades are assigned for each
area evaluated and the overall qualification.
   2.5.1. Area Grades. Table 2.1, Areas 1-60 establish mission essential tasks to be evaluated
   during the control phase and the appropriate grading criteria for those tasks. Areas 31-33
   may be evaluated procedurally during a field practical exercise or using an ACC/A3F
   approved simulator/s.
      2.5.1.1. A “Q” is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a
      satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed JTAC duties within the
      prescribed tolerances and accomplished the assigned mission.
      2.5.1.2. A “Q-” indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea
      tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the SEE.
      2.5.1.3. A “U” indicates the examinee is unqualified to perform the assigned task area
      and requires additional training. Also, a “U” will be assigned in any area for procedures
      that adversely affected mission accomplishment or compromise safety (T-3).
      2.5.1.4. Errors of omission occur when a function or operation is not performed. Errors
      of commission occur when a function or operation is performed improperly.
   2.5.2. Overall JTAC control phase qualification levels.
      2.5.2.1. Exceptionally Qualified (EQ). Award an EQ when, in the evaluator’s judgment,
      the examinee demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in all phases of the
      evaluation, and received a score of 100% on the ground phase portion of the evaluation.
      Individuals must receive a “Q” in all sub areas with no additional training assigned.
      Note: SEEs must ensure this grade is reserved only for personnel truly deserving it. This
      will prevent inflation and ensure the grade remains an indicator of exceptional
      achievement.
      2.5.2.2. Qualification Level 1 (Q-1). The JTAC demonstrated the desired performance
      level and knowledge of procedures, equipment, and directives within tolerances specified
      in the grading criteria. This will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted, but may
      be awarded when no more than two discrepancies were noted with no additional training
      required.
      2.5.2.3. Qualification Level 2 (Q-2). The JTAC demonstrated the ability to perform
      duties safely, but:
          2.5.2.3.1. There were one or more area(s)/sub-area(s) where additional training was
          assigned or three or more discrepancies were debriefed.
          2.5.2.3.2. In the judgment of the SEE, there is justification based on performance in
          one or several areas/sub-areas.
 20                                                       AFI13-112V2 25 SEPTEMBER 2014


       2.5.2.4. Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). The JTAC demonstrated an unacceptable level of
       safety, performance or knowledge.
           2.5.2.4.1. An area grade of “U” awarded in any area or sub-area from Table 2.1,
           Areas 1 through 50 requires an overall Q-3.
           2.5.2.4.2. An overall Q-3 can be awarded if, in the judgment of the SEE, there is
           justification based on performance in one or several areas/sub-areas.
           2.5.2.4.3. SEEs will use the grading criteria in this instruction to determine individual
           area grades (T-3). SEE judgment must be exercised when the wording of areas is
           subjective and when specific situations are not covered. SEE judgment will be the
           determining factor in arriving at the overall grade.
2.6. JTAC-I Evaluations. Following successful completion of all prerequisites listed in AFI
13-112, Volume 1, completion of a JTAC-I evaluation will be documented on an AF form 8 (T-
3). Table 2.1, Areas 61-70 establishes the tasks to be evaluated during the JTAC-I evaluation.
A unit commander signed JTAC-I designation letter will be placed in Part II of the individual’s
JTAC training and evaluation folder (T-3). Following initial certification units will award the
individual SEI 279 or 09D using AF Form 2096, Classification/On-The-Job-Training Action, or
the appropriate automated system (T-3).
2.7. SEE Objectivity Evaluation. Table 2.1, Areas 71-80 establishes the tasks to be evaluated
during the SEE objectivity evaluation. A unit commander signed SEE designation letter will be
placed in Part II of the individual’s JTAC training and evaluation folder (T-3). Following initial
certification units will award the individual SEI 281 or 09E using AF Form 2096 or the
appropriate automated system (T-3).
   AFI13-112V2 25 SEPTEMBER 2014                                           21

                                           Chapter 3

                                MASTER QUESTION FILES

3.1. Master Question File (MQF). The MQF is a set of applicable questions designed to assess
the knowledge of a JTAC in regards to critical doctrine, operations, and safety. ACC/A3F is
responsible for ensuring that an applicable MQF database and questions are maintained to
support this AFI. The MQF database and related source materials will be accessible to all
JTACs.
   3.1.1. Updates to the MQF. ACC/A3F will conduct an annual review of the MQF, to be
   completed by 30 September, with assistance and inputs from all MQF users. This does not
   relieve subordinate units from submitting required changes, as applicable, between review
   periods.
       3.1.1.1. The review will focus on correcting erroneous questions, deleting outdated or
       invalid questions, and/or adding new questions to the database as a result to changes in
       applicable TTPs.
       3.1.1.2. MAJCOMS will forward their suggested changes to ACC/A3F. ACC/A3F will
       adjudicate all MAJCOM inputs and publish an updated MQF within 30 days of the end of
       the review process.
3.2. Local Procedures Master Question File (LPMQF). The LPMQF is an optional set of
applicable questions designed to assess the knowledge of a JTAC in regards to range operations
procedures and safety procedures that include both local ranges and ranges frequently utilized for
JTAC training and evaluation. If used the group and squadron CSE is responsible for ensuring
that an applicable LPMQF database and questions are developed. If a group and squadron(s)
utilize the same training areas, then the Chiefs of Stan/Eval are responsible for ensuring that an
applicable LPMQF database and questions are developed.
   3.2.1. Updates to the LPMQF. Groups and squadrons will conduct an annual review of their
   LPMQF (if used), to be completed by September (T-3). Document the review in item 9 of
   the Stan/Eval Board (SEB) minutes.
       3.2.1.1. The review should focus on correcting erroneous questions, deleting outdated or
       invalid questions, and/or adding new questions to the database as a result to changes in
       local area range operations procedures and safety procedures.
       3.2.1.2. The updated LPMQF should be available within 30 days of the end of the review
       process.
3.3. Examination Requirements. The CSE is responsible for constructing a minimum of two
ground-phase evaluation examinations using the MQF and LPMQF (if used), databases (T-3).
Each exam will consist of 50 questions (T-3). No more than 50% duplication of questions will
be on each exam, unless examinations are randomly generated by a computer program (T-3). No
more than 10% of the questions will come from the LPMQF, when used, but there is no
minimum number of LPMQF questions (T-3).
   3.3.1. Security. Only Stan/Eval personnel and individuals designated by the commander
   will administer examinations (T-3). Stan/Eval will maintain strict control of all examinations
AFI13-112V2 25 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    35


   and answer keys by securing them in a locked container or password protected computer
   program (T-3).
   3.3.2. Construction of Questions. Questions must measure the correct information at the
   desired level of knowledge (T-3).
       3.3.2.1. Each question included in the MQF and LPMQF must include the correct answer
       and include the reference, paragraph, and page number for the subject matter (T-3).
       3.3.2.2. Questions will be multiple choice (four choices desired with only one most
       correct answer) (T-3).
       3.3.2.3. Questions that have numerical answers will have the answers arranged in order
       from largest to smallest or vice versa (T-3).
       3.3.2.4. In general, questions should avoid negative statements (T-3). However, if the
       word “not” appears in the question, either underline it or type it in all capital letters for
       attention (T-3).
3.4. MQF and LPMQF Classification Guidelines. Although the desire is to maintain
unclassified MQF and LPMQF databases, the overall classification of the MQF and LPMQF
databases is determined by the highest classification of its contents (T-0). Questions extracted
from the MQF and LPMQF databases will be managed according to their classification (T-0).
Stan/Eval personnel will mark examinations appropriately and protect them in accordance with
security directives (T-0). Whether they contain classified questions or not, Stan/Eval personnel
will handle the examinations as controlled items (T-3).

                        JTAC EVALUATION DOCUMENTATION

4.1. Purpose. To properly document accomplishment of JTAC certification and qualification
(currency) standards, units will build and maintain a JTAC training and evaluation folder for
each JTAC in accordance with AFI 13-112 Volume 1, chapter 6 (T-0). This folder will hold all
records dealing with an individual’s JTAC Stan/Eval history and training history IAW AFI 13-
112 Volume 1, chapter 6 (T-0). The JTAC training and evaluation folders will be maintained
separately from the individual’s training folder that contains non-JTAC training documentation
(i.e. AF 623 Individual Training Record Folder, or locally produced training folder) (T-3).
JTAC-Is will coordinate inputs to an individual’s JTAC training and evaluation folder with the
unit Chief JTAC-I and the unit’s CSE, as appropriate. The unit will maintain JTAC training and
evaluation folders (Training Jacket) on JTACs retiring or separating in accordance with AFI 13-
112 Volume 1 (T-3).
   4.1.1. Unit Stan/Eval sections will ensure that an individual’s AF Form 942 and
   documentation of all evaluations conducted since initial certification are placed in Part IV of
   the JTAC’s training and evaluation folder. (T-0).
4.2. Description of Folders. Until an electronic version of the JTAC training and evaluation
folder is approved for use, each JTAC must have a hard copy of section IV of the folder,
including those on inactive status (T-0). See AFI 13-112 Volume 1 for folder description.
   4.2.1. Part IV. DOCUMENTATION OF EVALUATIONS. This part, sub-divided into
   three sections and contains documentation of all evaluations conducted since initial
   qualification. CSE will provide an MFR for all missing evaluation records (T-3).
       4.2.1.1. Section 1 - AF Form 942. The AF Form 942 will be used as a record of
       evaluations and annual reviews throughout a JTAC’s career, with the most current on top
       and the Minor Discrepancy logs beneath the AF IMT 942 (T-3). See Attachment 2 for
       formatting AF Form 942 and Attachment 5 for Minor Discrepancy Log.
       4.2.1.2. Section 2 - AF Form 8 (see Attachment 4 for formatting). Place the most
       current AF Form 8 and previously authorized forms (i.e. AF Form 3827) on top (T-0).
       Any MFR that pertains to a specific AF Form 8 will be placed directly on top of that AF
       Form 8 (T-3). Major AF Form 8 discrepancies (those that effect JTAC certification) will
       be corrected/documented with a commander-signed MFR (T-3).
       4.2.1.3. Section 3 - MFRs not related to a specific AF Form 8. File the documents in
       chronological order, with the most recent on top.
   4.2.2. Maintaining JTAC Stan/Eval Records. To properly store JTAC Stan/Eval records,
   units will build (as required) and maintain a JTAC training and evaluation folder for each
   JTAC IAW this instruction (T-3). This folder will hold all records and documentation
   dealing with an individuals’ JTAC Stan/Eval history. Each SEE will coordinate inputs to an
   individual’s JTAC training and evaluation folder, unit Chief JTAC-I and the unit’s CSE, as
   appropriate, to ensure JTAC Stan/Eval and training documentation is completed, as required
   (T-3).
AFI13-112V2 25 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                            37


     4.2.2.1. The JTAC training and evaluation folder will be maintained by the unit’s Chief
     JTAC-I in a secured container or, if MAJCOM approved, in an electronic format in
     TACTICS or other approved web based program. (T-3).
     4.2.2.2. When a JTAC deploys, they will carry a copy of their evaluation records from
     their JTAC training and evaluation folder to the deployed location; the copy may be
     hardcopy or electronic format (i.e. .pdf) (T-0).

              STAN/EVAL BOARD AND TREND ANALYSIS PROGRAM

5.1. Stan/Eval Board (SEB). The unit commander, or their designated representative, will
chair a semi-annual SEB (T-3). As a minimum, the Director of Operations, Operations
Superintendent, CSE, and Chief JTAC-I will attend (T-3). Attachment 3 identifies the format
for the SEB minutes.
   5.1.1. The CSE or commander designated representative will coordinate the schedule,
   agenda, and attendees for the semi-annual SEB (T-3). The SEB minutes will be sent to the
   next higher headquarters no later than 30 days after the conclusion of the SEB (T-3).
   5.1.2. Groups will consolidate unit SEB minutes to determine any group-wide trends (T-3).
   5.1.3. Wings will review group minutes and provide cross-tell to their parent MAJCOM (T-
   3).
5.2. Trend Analysis Program. Stan/Eval organizations at the group and squadron level will
establish a Trends Analysis Program (T-3). Group and squadron commanders are the final
authority for establishing their unit’s trends (T-3).
   5.2.1. The group/squadron will establish specific trend analysis threshold percentages and
   procedures (T-3). The Trend Analysis Program will include an objective analysis of all
   JTAC evaluations, written examinations, and any deficiencies/items of interest observed
   during exercises and contingencies (T-3). Group and Squadron CSEs will report any
   negative trend data, recommend corrective actions, assign an OPR/OCR, and report trend
   status to the SEB (T-3).
   5.2.2. The trend program is the commander’s program, and the commander will determine
   which trends to effectively track, evaluate, correct and close, and for how long (T-3).
   5.2.3. Trend data will be included in the SEB minutes and follow-up actions will be
   addressed at the subsequent SEBs until the discrepancies are corrected/closed (T-3). The
   CSE must maintain the trend analysis data collected from the date of the last unit inspection
   (T-3).
       5.2.3.1. For written examination trends, consider the validity of the question, and the
       need for and/or appropriateness of increased emphasis in the question’s subject area.
       5.2.3.2. For control phase trends, calculate the percentage of “Q”, “Q-” and “U” grades
       against the total number of evaluations given in the sub-area. Trends are not always
       identified by a threshold percentage, but may be determined by the commander’s
       assessment as a potential weakness area.
AFI13-112V2 25 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                  39

             CONTROLLER READ FILE AND SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS

6.1. Controller Read File (CRF) Publications Library. Units employing JTACs will establish
and maintain a library consisting of a current read file and publications (T-3). This library will
consist of a minimum of four volumes as listed in paragraphs 6.2 through 6.7 of this AFI in
either hardcopy or electronic format (T-3). If an electronic library is maintained, it must be
accessible to all JTACs (T-3). Units will establish procedures to ensure JTACs who are TDY to
their location review the CRF Vol 1, part B before controlling aircraft in their Area of
Responsibility (AOR) or Local Training Area (LTA) (T-3).
   6.1.1. Units maintaining a CRF library will appoint, in writing, a CRF monitor to ensure
   proper maintenance as directed by this document (T-3). The Squadron Stan/Eval function
   will be responsible for CRF standardization for subordinate organizations (i.e. detachment,
   operating locations) (T-3). Place the appointment letter in Part A of the CRF (T-3).
       6.1.1.1. The unit Stan/Eval function is the focal point for any data to be entered in the
       CRF. Staff agencies desiring to insert information into the CRF will submit the
       information to the CSE for coordination and distribution (Volume V excluded) (T-3).
       Entries will be limited to those items that have a direct bearing on immediate JTAC
       requirements (T-3). To prevent overwhelming JTACs with unnecessary details, only
       salient points will be extracted from lengthy documents or highlighted if inclusion in
       Volume I is necessary.
       6.1.1.2. Required Volumes. Volume I is a table of contents for all volumes and current
       read file items, Volumes II through IV are made up of publications, and Volume V
       (optional) is reserved for safety information (T-3). If units choose hardcopy format and
       the contents of any volume exceed the capacity of its binder, use an additional binder and
       identify the first and subsequent binders by a letter of sequence (e.g., IIIA, IIIB) (T-3).
6.2. Volume I - Table of Contents/CRF. Volume I consists of a minimum of two parts to
include an Index (Part A) and Current Read Files (Parts B) and C (Note: Part C is optional) (T-
3). MAJCOMs/NAFs/Groups may add additional components to Volume I as appropriate.
   6.2.1. Part A is a table of contents listing all material contained in CRF Volumes I through V
   (T-3).
   6.2.2. Part B is the Current Read File of CRF messages. Messages contain information
   temporary in nature, directly pertinent to the safe conduct of JTAC duties, and must be read
   before controlling (T-3).
       6.2.2.1. Part B will contain a numerical index reflecting current information and will be
       annotated with an assigned control number, title, date distributed, suspense date for
       removal, OPR, date rescinded, and disposition (T-3). As a minimum, the control number
       and suspense date for removal will be annotated on each CRF item (T-3). The suspense
       date for removal may serve as a review date. If, after review, the item is still valid and
       necessary, the suspense date must be changed or the item reissued (T-3).
       6.2.2.2. Items in Part B will be filed in reverse numerical sequence with the latest item
       on top. Classified entries will be cross-referenced to the appropriate location (T-3).

      6.2.2.3. Rescinded items will be maintained in a file, separate from the CRF library, for 6
      months IAW the Air Force RDS using the RIMS (https://webrims.amc.af.mil), and
      referenced on the index until the end of the following quarter (T-3).
   6.2.3. Part C is the Current Read File that contains information temporary in nature but not
   related to the safe conduct of performance of JTAC duties (T-3). Part C is optional.
   6.2.4. Refer to Attachment 6 for a sample message format for use when issuing a CRF item
   from a MAJCOM/NAF stan/eval organization.
   6.2.5. Publications Library.   Volumes II through IV will consist of a CRF Functional
   Publications Library (T-3).
      6.2.5.1. All publications in the library will be current and complete (T-3).

            CHIEF OF STAN/EVAL & STAN/EVAL EXAMINER CRITERIA

7.1. CSE. Due to the critical nature of terminal attack control, commanders will appoint by
letter, only their best-qualified individuals, based on the criteria listed below and the ability to
run the Stan/Eval Program (T-3). Minimum criteria for selection include:
   7.1.1. Must be at least a TSgt and a 1C471 or 1C271, or Captain 13L3, 1XXXU or 13C3 (T-
   3).
   7.1.2. Must maintain JTAC CMR qualifications as required by this instruction and AFI 13-
   112, Volume 1 (T-3).
   7.1.3. Must have 1 year experience as a designated SEE (T-3).
   7.1.4. Must maintain JTAC-I qualification (T-3).
   7.1.5. Must have successfully completed a SEE objectivity evaluation (T-0).
7.2. SEE. Commanders will appoint, by letter, SEEs selected from among the most highly
qualified and experienced JTACs assigned to their unit (T-3). Minimum criteria for selection
include:
   7.2.1. Must be at least a SSgt, 1C451, 1C251, or 13L3, 1XXXU, or 13C3 (T-3).
   7.2.2. Must maintain JTAC CMR qualification IAW this instruction and AFI 13-112,
   Volume 1 (T-0).
   7.2.3. Must successfully complete a SEE objectivity evaluation (T-0).
   7.2.4. Must successfully complete the group developed SEE Upgrade Training Program and
   demonstrate thorough knowledge of the JTAC Stan/Eval Program, flight/ground safety
   standards, and governing supplements/instructions prior to SEE qualification (T-0).
   7.2.5. Must be or have been a qualified JTAC-I (T-3). SEEs who evaluate a JTAC-I must be
   qualified a JTAC-I (T-3).
7.3. Number of Unit-Level SEEs. The commander and CSE will determine the number of
SEEs, however, a minimum of one SEE will be designated for each group and squadron to assist
the CSE in the conduct of the Stan/Eval Program (T-3).
7.4. SEE Objectivity Evaluations. The CSE (or a commander designated SEE) will administer
an objectivity evaluation to determine whether a SEE is qualified to administer qualification
evaluations (T-3). SEE objectivity evaluations will be documented on AF Form 8 (T-1). SEEs
will receive Spot objectivity evaluations when directed by the commander or during a unit
effectiveness inspection using Table 2.1, Areas 71-80 (T-3).
   7.4.1. The overall rating for an objectivity evaluation is either “Q-1” or “Q-3.”
   Observations, analysis, and other substantial actions are directed primarily at the SEE
   conducting the evaluation and will not interfere with or affect the individual taking the
   qualification evaluation except for safety issues (T-3).
       7.4.1.1. A “Q-1” rating indicates that the observed SEE complied with higher
       headquarters and local Stan/Eval directives, properly briefed and debriefed the examinee,
44                                                    AFI13-112V2 25 SEPTEMBER 2014


     correctly identified discrepancies, awarded the correct area and overall rating, properly
     documented the evaluation, and, if required, recommended appropriate additional
     training.
     7.4.1.2. A “Q-3” rating is awarded when the observed SEE fails to satisfy the objectivity
     evaluation requirements (T-3). An overall “Q-3” grade must be awarded if the JTAC
     demonstrated an unacceptable level of safety, performance or knowledge (T-3).
  7.4.2. A SEE objectivity evaluation does not fulfill the requirements of a JTAC mission
  evaluation (i.e., SEEs must maintain JTAC CMR status required in AFI 13-112, Volume 1
  and accomplish a recurring JTAC mission evaluation (T-0).
  7.4.3. Following initial SPOT objectivity qualification as a JTAC SEE, units will award the
  individual SEI using AF Form 2096 or the appropriate automated system (T-1). Note: SEI
  281 or 09E will be additive to the members list of qualified SEIs and not replace SEI 914 or
  09C.
  7.4.4. Chiefs of Stan/Eval and SEEs are not authorized to change a SEE’s Objectivity
  Evaluation rating (area or overall), that was awarded by another SEE unless a valid
  administrative error was made (T-3). The group’s commander must review the contested
  evaluation rating and approve/disapprove a change or direct another SEE objectivity
  evaluation (T-3).

Terms
Additional Training— Any training recommended to remedy deficiencies identified during an
evaluation that must be completed by a due date. This training may include self-study, ground
instruction, or JTAC missions. Additional training must include demonstration of satisfactory
knowledge or proficiency to a JTAC-I to qualify as completed. Document completion on AF
Form 8.
Close Air Support (CAS)— Air action by fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft against hostile targets
which are in close proximity to friendly forces and which require detailed integration of each air
mission with the fire and movement of those forces. (JP 1-02)
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)— The status of individuals who successfully completes MQT,
passes mission qualification evaluations, complies with continuation training requirements, and
are assigned to a unit with a primary combat mission in support of a specified DOC statement.
Continuation Training (CT)— Academic and positional training required to maintain CMR
qualification. Additional advanced training exceeding the minimum upgrade training
requirements with emphasis on present or future duty assignments. (AFI 36-2201, Air Force
Training Program)
Control-Phase Evaluation—A JTAC control-phase evaluation is a field evaluation involving all
elements for requesting coordinating and controlling airborne weapon systems employed during
terminal attacks (i.e. CAS mission). These JTAC evaluations allow commanders to assess
personnel, who in the performance of their duties, exercise judgment or execute decisions to
prevent putting themselves and others at great hazard, i.e., clearance to release ordnance.
Debriefed Discrepancy— Remedial action taken by an examiner to correct a discrepancy noted
during a JTAC evaluation. This action is accomplished during debrief of the evaluation wherein
the examiner provides briefing/instruction concerning the discrepancy and determines that the
examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or proficiency to remedy said discrepancy. The
discrepancy area/sub-area description is annotated with “Debriefed” in the “Comments” section
of the AF Form 8.
Eligibility Period— The six month period prior to the expiration date of a JTAC certification
during which all ground phase and control phase requirements for the recurring qualification
evaluation must be completed.
Evaluation— This includes the ground phase and control phase used to determine qualification
as a JTAC as prescribed by governing directives.
AFI13-112V2 25 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                    51


Forward Air Controller (Airborne)— Also called FAC(A). A specifically trained and
qualified aviation officer who exercises control (from the air) of aircraft engaged in close air
support of ground troops. The FAC(A) is normally an airborne extension of the TACP. The
FAC(A) must complete the Joint Firepower Course, the FAC(A) Course and MDS MR top-off
training in accordance with AFI 11-2MDS Volume 1, Aircrew Training (OPR: ACC/DOTO).
Initial Qualification Training (IQT)— It consists of training requirements needed to train
personnel in their primary duty.
Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC)— A JTAC is specially trained, qualified, and
authorized to provide terminal control of CAS aircraft conducting operations in support of
ground forces. Standardized training of JTACs is essential to providing effective command and
control of all CAS missions. The complexity of coordinating CAS with fire support and
maneuver units of ground forces requires a detailed understanding of aerospace power
capabilities and other fire support means.
Joint Terminal Attack Controller—Instructor (JTAC-I) - An experienced JTAC CMR-
qualified individual certified to instruct other individuals in operations academics and JTAC
duties.
Local Procedures Master Question File (LPMQF)— Unit level CSE created collection of
multiple-choice questions derived from local and/or commonly used range regulations.
Master Question File (MQF)— A headquarters-designated OPR (i.e., MAJCOM) developed
database of Stan/Eval program related multiple choice questions derived from mission area
publications. Stan/Eval functions use the MQF in constructing examinations that this instruction
requires. All JTACs have access to the MQF.
Mission Essential Task List (METL)— An unconstrained statement of tasks required to
complete wartime mission.
Mission Evaluation— Qualifies an individual to perform the unit’s operational mission.
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)— MQT contains the academic training requirements to
attain CMR status. This includes all training requirements needed to train personnel to execute
the unit’s DOC statement mission taskings in accordance with joint/combined directives and
procedures, e.g., operations plans, supplemental plans, etc.
Non-Combat Mission Ready (N-CMR)—This is the status of an individual who does not meet
CMR training requirements IAW AFI 13-112V1, fails the written examination (twice) during a
no-notice, Spot or recurring evaluation, fails to complete a recurring evaluation by the scheduled
date, fails to satisfy additional training requirements identified during an evaluation, or the unit
commander or DO determines to be non-proficient. A JTAC-I must supervise these individuals.
No-Notice Evaluation—Give this evaluation at such time that preparation, beyond that which is
normally accomplished for the mission, is not possible. These evaluations may be a complete
qualification evaluation, a written examination only, or an evaluation covering only selected
areas.
RQ evaluation— An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of qualification due to expiration
of a required periodic evaluation or a failed JTAC evaluation.
 52                                                      AFI13-112V2 25 SEPTEMBER 2014


Re-examination—This is the re-accomplishment of a required written examination following a
failure.
Scenario— A document or set of documents that describes the tactics employed while
simulating the unit’s mission in support of its DOC statement mission tasking(s).
Special Interest Item (SII)— This is an operational subject area of concern designated by the
higher headquarters commander and staff for evaluation and used to focus units on specific areas
of concern.
Spot Evaluation— An additional commander’s evaluation tool. Commanders direct this
qualification evaluation outside the eligibility period to ensure correction of identified
discrepancies or to check an individual's proficiency. A Spot evaluation is normally limited in
scope. It may be either a field evaluation and/or a written examination. These evaluations may
be either no-notice or with prior coordination.
Standardization/Evaluation Examiner (SEE)— The SEE is a qualified JTAC who has
completed an objectivity evaluation successfully and is designated to perform evaluation duties
as specified by this instruction. SEEs must be current and qualified in the position they are
evaluating. SEEs are trained and certified to administer JTAC evaluations at the direction of the
CSE.
Standardization/Evaluation Examiner Objectivity Evaluation— An evaluation administered
by the CSE, or a higher headquarters CSE or SEE, to determine a unit SEE’s ability to perform
their duties. Documentation on the qualification of a SEE is accomplished using AF Forms 942
and 8. Upon successful completion of the SEE Objectivity Evaluation, the commander appoints
a SEE by a formal letter of appointment.
Supervised Status— The status of a JTAC who may only control under the supervision of a
JTAC-I qualified in that specific mission type. The level of supervision required is determined
by the unit commander (or operations officer in the commander’s absence).
Tactical Air Control Party (TACP)— The TACP is the principal Air Force liaison element
collocated with Army maneuver units from battalion through corps. The primary TACP mission
is to advise ground commanders on the capabilities and limitations of aerospace power. The
TACP assists the land commander in planning, requesting, and coordinating air and space
support. The TACP provides the primary terminal attack control of airpower in support of
ground or surface forces. TACPs may employ JTACs at company/team level.
Trend Analysis Program— Formal analysis program established to identify areas requiring
attention, monitoring, or correction.
Unit— A unit is defined as a group, squadron or detachment. It also refers to any operations
section that is required to establish its own JTAC Stan/Eval program.
Unit Training Assembly (UTA)— The UTA is one full ANG/AFRC drill weekend. When
computing due dates, the UTA weekend on which an event initially takes place does not count.
For example, a reference allows for two UTAs for completion of an event. The original
decision/event occurs during the drill weekend in March. The unit/individual would have until
the end of the drill weekend in May to complete the action/response. The use of weekday and
evening training periods will not shorten this time period.
AFI13-112V2 25 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                             53


Unqualified— This is the status of an individual JTAC who’s: most recent JTAC mission
evaluation Form 8 has expired, has received a Q3 on their most recent JTAC mission evaluation
or JTAC SPOT evaluation, or has been decertified at the direction of the commander.
Written Examinations— Written examinations required for satisfactory completion of the
ground-phase evaluation. Examination will be drawn from the MAJCOM Master Question File
(MQF) and local procedures (LPMQF). MAJCOM or NAF supplements may specify additional
written examinations, such as rules of engagement, etc.
