             OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL
                               TINKER AIR FORCE BASE
DID YOU KNOW? Air Force military and civilian members have a duty to report Fraud,
Waste & Abuse, mismanagement, a violation of any Air Force instruction, an injustice,
deficiency or like conditions, to a superior or commander in their chain of command, to
an IG, other appropriate inspector, or within any established grievance channels.
                               The Office of the Inspector General (IG) is available to assist in resolving
                               complaints and concerns as defined by AFI 90-301, Inspector General
                               Complaints Resolution Program.

                               The IG is just one of many avenues to consider when submitting a
                               complaint. Usually the most effective choice is your “chain of command.”
                               Regardless of which avenue you select, be assured that Air Force leaders
                               are interested and receptive to all your complaints and concerns.

                                                                   CHRISTOPHER W. PARRY, Lt Col, USAF
