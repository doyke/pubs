1       3                       Add to “Supersedes”, CFETP 3E4X2, 29 July 2002, CFETP
                                3E4X2C1, 1 Apr 2003; and CFETP 3E4X2C2, 22 Aug 2003
2       29      2.6.1.3.        Replace section 2.6.1.3.

2.6.1.3. Transcribing to a new CFETP. Transcribing to a new CFETP is an administration
function, not a re-evaluation of training. Therefore, supervisor and trainer are considered
synonymous for the purpose of training. Transcribe within 120 days (240 days for ARC) of
published date of revised CFETP. Upon completion of a new CFETP, use the following
procedures to transcribe:

2.6.1.3.1. Use the new CFTEP to identify past and current training requirements and to transcribe
qualifications from previous CFETP.

       2.6.1.3.2. For tasks previously certified and still required in the current duty position, circle
       the subparagraph number next to the task statement and enter the current date in the
       completion column. Trainee initials in the trainee column and the current task certifier or
       supervisor/trainer initials in the trainer column.

       2.6.1.3.3. For tasks previously certified but not required in the current duty position (do not
       circle), transcribe only the previous certification dates (no initials). If the task later
       becomes required in the duty position, recertify using current dates and initials.

       2.6.1.3.4. Annotate the AF Form 623a, (for example, “I certify the information contained in
       the CFETP dated XX was transcribed to the CFETP dated XX, and the trainee was given
       the superseded CFETP.” Signed and dated by the supervisor and trainee).
