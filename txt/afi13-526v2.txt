                                            Chapter 1

                                           GENERAL

1.1. Objective. Guidance contained in Volume 1, 3, and 4 of this instruction series is written
exclusive of each other based upon the mission that is to be executed. Specifically, guidance
from one of these Volumes does not apply to any of the other Volumes. This Volume prescribes
the basic guidance and approved procedures for planning, scheduling, controlling, executing, and
supporting airlift missions transporting Department of Energy (DOE)/National Nuclear Security
Administration (NNSA) category I and II Special Nuclear Material (SNM). The AF may be
tasked to move this material in support of a United States nonproliferation policy designed to
reduce its worldwide commerce.
1.2. Key Words Explained
   1.2.1. “Will” and “shall” indicate a mandatory requirement.
   1.2.2. "Should" is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
   accomplishment.
   1.2.3. "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.2.4. "Note" indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which are considered essential
   to emphasize.
1.3. Responsibilities. AMC, Nuclear Operations Division (AMC/A3N), is the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) for this instruction. Unless otherwise specified in cited source
references, AMC/A3 is the waiver authority for the procedures unique to this publication and 18
AF/CC is the authority for specified mission planning and execution waivers.
1.4. Distribution. The following individuals and agencies associated with supporting or
executing DOE SNM airlift operations will maintain a copy of this instruction:
   1.4.1. Operations, logistics, and safety staff agencies.
   1.4.2. Security Forces units.
   1.4.3. Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) airlift squadron(s)/units.
   1.4.4. Each individual PNAF aircrew member.
   1.4.5. Custodial unit Civil Engineering, Readiness and Emergency Management, and
   Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) units.
1.5. Protecting Classified Information.
   1.5.1. Use caution at all times to avoid compromising classified information. Adhere to all
   available classification guidance.
   1.5.2. The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Security Classification Policy, CG-W-5, Joint
   DOE/DoD Nuclear Weapon Classification Policy Guide, TCG-WPMU-2, Joint DOE/DoD
   Topical Classification Guide for Weapon Production and Military Use, Economy Act, and
   Mission Setup Message govern the classification of nuclear mission information. Restricted
   data and formerly restricted data are not normally releasable to foreign nationals (NOFORN).
 6                                                                 AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013


     Do not send this type of information to any agency (civilian or military) of a foreign
     government unless directed to do so by an authoritative publication.
     1.5.3. Do not use terms in unclassified text that reveals DOE SNM or classified cargo is
     aboard a specific aircraft or mission or at a specific location.
     1.5.4. Do not talk around classified information. Use only the SAAM number, aircraft tail
     number, or Aircraft Commander’s name when discussing a particular mission in unclassified
     media or via open lines. Do not use the term “DOE SNM” in conjunction with the SAAM
     number, aircraft tail number, or Aircraft Commander’s name. Do not discuss shipping
     information that reveals actual nuclear cargo data (e.g., nuclear cargo or package name) via
     unclassified means.
     1.5.5. Do not talk about any aspect of a DOE SNM SAAM unless the other person has an
     appropriate security clearance and a definite need-to-know. This applies even after a mission
     is complete.
     1.5.6. For specific guidance on classification of Special Nuclear Material, refer to DoDI O-
     5210.67, Special Nuclear Material Information, Security Classification Guidance.
1.6. Releasing Information. Only appropriate commanders and public affairs officers may
release information about nuclear mishaps to the public or news media. Public Affairs will
ensure timely and uniform implementation of DoD approved policies as referenced in DoDI
5400.13, Public Affairs Operations, and AFI 35-104, Media Operations, to establish and conduct
efficient and effective procedures for the release of nuclear activity information to the public,
including news media (domestic, international), to include nuclear operations, accidents, IND
incidents, or nuclear weapon significant incidents.
1.7. Nuclear Transportation Working Group
     1.7.1. Nuclear Transportation Working Group (NTWG).
        1.7.1.1. IAW DoDI 4540.05, DoD Transportation of U.S. Nuclear Weapons and AFPD
        21-2, Munitions, the NTWG provides a forum to resolve issues pertaining to efficient,
        safe, and secure transportation of nuclear cargo.
        1.7.1.2. AF/A10 is the service lead to this meeting in order to present the Air Force
        position on NTWG agenda items as well as discuss current topics involving Air Force
        nuclear transportation issues.
        1.7.1.3. AF/A10 will limit participation from MAJCOM, Air and Space Operations
        Center (AOC), and Unit personnel to the minimum deemed necessary to support
        discussions on specific issues. Agencies will be invited by AF/A10 as necessary.
1.8. Background.
     1.8.1. The DOE/NNSA Human Reliability Program (HRP) performs the same function as
     the DoD’s Personnel Reliability Program (PRP). The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
     establishes procedures for the HRP at 10 CFR PART 712. It also highlights the requirement
     for PRP qualified aircrews to transport DOE/NNSA SNM. The DOE/NNSA will ensure that
     anyone involved in the movement of Cat I quantities of SNM is supervised under HRP.
     1.8.2. One material the DOE/NNSA may ask the AF to transport is Highly Enriched
     Uranium (HEU). HEU is a very desirable material that in many cases is the missing link in a
AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013                                                                      7


   nuclear weapon. Under DOE/NNSA custody, this material receives security and protection
   commensurate with DoD nuclear assets. During transport of Cat I quantities of SNM,
   DOE/NNSA provides the equivalent of Type I security offered to all DoD nuclear weapons
   and warheads.
1.9. Assumptions.
   1.9.1. Aircrews will not deviate from governing AFI 11-2C-17, Vol 3, C-17 Operations
   Procedures, guidance without AMC/A3 approval.
   1.9.2. DOE/NNSA SNM is properly prepared and certified for air shipment aboard AF
   aircraft in accordance with AFMAN 24-204(I)/TM 38-250/NAVSUP PUB 505/MCO
   P4030.19I/ DLAI 4145.3, 1 September 2009, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military
   Air Shipments.
   1.9.3. DOE/NNSA SNM will be accompanied by DOE/NNSA technical escorts to monitor
   cargo and provide technical assistance to aircrew pertaining to overall safety of shipment.
   1.9.4. DOE/NNSA SNM will be assigned JCS priority 1A3 as determined CJCSI 4120.02C,
   Assignment of Movement and Mobility Priority.
   1.9.5. DoD nuclear or nuclear-related cargo and DOE/NNSA SNM will not be combined on
   the same mission.
1.10. Aircrew Complement.
   1.10.1. Missions transporting DOE/NNSA Category I or II SNM must be conducted with a
   PRP certified crew.

                                             Chapter 2

                                  MISSION MANAGEMENT

2.1. General. This Chapter provides guidance in planning and scheduling DOE/NNSA SNM
airlift missions. All missions transporting DOE/NNSA SNM will be planned by 618 AOC
(TACC)/XOOOD IAW established mission-planning procedures for general SAAM missions.
OPSEC is essential at all times and in all mission correspondence. DOE/NNSA SNM mission
success relies upon reliable, qualified, and prepared aircrews and support personnel during all
phases of a mission (from planning through execution).
2.2. Planning Criteria.
   2.2.1. Movements should be tasked early enough to allow 10-days for mission planning,
   coordination, and aircraft preparation.
   2.2.2. Deliver DOE/NNSA SNM cargo by the most efficient route to minimize the number
   of landings and handling of DOE/NNSA SNM cargo.
   2.2.3. Loading operations may be accomplished during hours of daylight or at night.
   2.2.4. Mission planners, aircrew, shipper, and receiver personnel will coordinate on all
   scheduled operations and sequences of events.
   2.2.5. Schedulers, planners, and operating crews must also consider the following:
       2.2.5.1. DoD Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG), at https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil or
       http://www.fcg.pentagon.smil.mil, which also includes a Classified Supplement.
       2.2.5.2. Host installation restrictions.
       2.2.5.3. Airfield restrictions, operating hours, Prior Permission Required (PPR), etc.
       2.2.5.4. Pertinent Letters of Understanding (LOUs)
       2.2.5.5. User capability (hours of operation, security, etc.)
       2.2.5.6. DoD S-5210.41M_AFMAN 31-108, Nuclear Weapons Security Manual.
   2.2.6. Aircrew scheduling requirements/limits in AFI 11-2C-17, Vol 3 and this instruction
   apply. Due to the critical importance of safely transporting DOE/NNSA SNM cargo, the
   portion of any mission from the beginning of Crew Duty Day (CDD) until the aircrew is no
   longer required, is further restricted as follows:
       2.2.6.1. When DOE/NNSA SNM cargo is airlifted, all duties will be accomplished
       within the DOE/NNSA SNM CDD. When duties are complete or the DOE/NNSA SNM
       CDD has expired, aircrew may only perform non-DOE/NNSA SNM ground/flight duties
       within the remaining Crew Duty Time (CDT) IAW AFI 11-2C-17, Vol 3.
          2.2.6.1.1. Basic DOE/NNSA SNM CDD. Limited to 16+00 hours (regardless of
          crew composition).
          2.2.6.1.2. Augmented DOE/NNSA SNM CDD. Limited to 20+00 hours for missions
          scheduled for aerial refueling (A/R) or a C17 mission using the extended range tank
          in lieu of an A/R. If a scheduled A/R is canceled after crew alert and the crew was
10                                                             AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013


        alerted for a 20-hour crew duty day, DOE/NNSA SNM CDD will not exceed 20+00
        hours.
     2.2.6.2. Basic and Augmented DOE/NNSA SNM CDDs include ground time for loading
     and offloading of DOE/NNSA SNM cargo and terminates when the aircrew is no longer
     required. Additionally, the operating crew must develop a work-rest plan to mitigate
     Operational Risk Management (ORM) factors.
     2.2.6.3. The 18 AF/CC is the waiver authority for DOE/NNSA SNM scheduling
     requirements and CDD limits associated with this instruction. Waivers may be requested
     by either the operating wing or the 618 AOC (TACC).
     2.2.6.4. Ensure adequate ground time is available for proper crew rest prior to executing
     a DOE/NNSA SNM airlift mission segment.
        2.2.6.4.1. Before home station departure or crew replacement, stage, or swap, crew
        duty periods will not exceed 16+00 hours unless crews are afforded a minimum of
        24+00 hours ground time prior to alerting for a DOE/NNSA SNM airlift mission.
        2.2.6.4.2. During non-nuclear DOE/NNSA SNM mission segments (no DOE/NNSA
        SNM transported, onloaded, or offloaded), CDT will be IAW AFI 11-2C-17, Vol 3.
        These segments will not be planned to exceed a basic 16+00 hour CDD unless ground
        time at the DOE/NNSA SNM loading location is at least 24+00 hours prior to
        executing a DOE/NNSA SNM mission segment.
     2.2.6.5. Ground Operations. Required ground operations vary greatly depending upon
     the cargo type, quantity, and overall complexity of the operation. Therefore, planners
     will develop the mission itinerary with detailed input from the DOE/NNSA and operating
     squadron/unit prior to publishing the Mission Setup Message.
        2.2.6.5.1. Remain Over Night (RON). Crew rest locations should be selected not
        only for mission requirements, but also to provide a suitable atmosphere for crew rest.
        2.2.6.5.2. To ensure crew and installation support personnel are focused solely upon
        the offload operation, DOE/NNSA SNM missions will normally be scheduled to crew
        rest at the conclusion of a DOE/NNSA SNM airlift segment. Note: If custodial
        installation aircraft support is inadequate for RON conditions between offload and
        onload operations, a repositioning leg is authorized to a suitable installation.
            2.2.6.5.2.1. Normal ground time between arrival and departure is 17+15 hours. If
            both an offload upon arrival and onload prior to departure are scheduled, ground
            time should be a minimum of 20+15 hours. Planners may adjust ground time to
            satisfy known mission requirements, but ground time will never be less than
            16+30 hours.
            2.2.6.5.2.2. DOE/NNSA SNM missions carrying DOE/NNSA SNM cargo will
            not be scheduled to RON at an en route location. With the exception of
            emergency divert situations, DOE/NNSA SNM cargo laden aircraft will only
            RON at installations with adequate support.
            2.2.6.5.2.3. USAFE/A3/10 approval is required to RON with DOE/NNSA SNM
            cargo aboard (Hot RON) in the USAFE Area of Responsibility (AOR).
AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013                                                                        11


          2.2.6.5.3. En route Stop (Non-RON). Normal ground time for loading and
          offloading is 3+15 hours. Planners must adjust this time based on the type and
          quantity of cargo being transported, ground support available, and anticipated
          complexity of on/offload procedures. Do not pad ground or flight times to avoid
          delays or cut times to remain within DOE/NNSA SNM CDD constraints.
2.3. Air Refueling (A/R).
   2.3.1. A/R may be planned where feasible to reduce ground exposure to the DOE/NNSA
   SNM cargo and when necessary to make destinations and suitable alternates with required
   contingency fuel.
   2.3.2. Mission planners will coordinate with 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOKS for tanker support.
   618 AOC (TACC)/XOPSA will coordinate altitude reservations with the appropriate altitude
   reservation facility. Plan a backup 24­hour slip in tanker support and altitude reservations, if
   applicable.
       2.3.2.1. AOC mission planners, flight managers, and tanker units may split planned
       single primary tanker offload of fuel across multiple tankers. Tanker formations should
       be kept to two tankers for an air refueling segment.
       2.3.2.2. Include the following information in the tanker request and A/R supplement:
          2.3.2.2.1. Airborne or manned ground spares for each primary tanker. For purposes
          of spare tanker requests a single tanker offload planned to be split across multiple
          tankers is one primary tanker needing one primary spare. To minimize spare tanker
          requirements with single tanker split offload over multiple tankers each tanker will be
          able to provide the entire mission required fuel independently.
              2.3.2.2.1.1. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD mission planners will determine the best
              option to meet the requirements of that particular mission segment. The mission
              planners will coordinate the information with 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOKS for
              planning.
              2.3.2.2.1.2. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD mission planners will provide the
              operating tanker crew a briefing concerning mission OPSEC, routing, and other
              relevant restrictions via secure means.
   2.3.3. To prepare for the unlikely event of an unsuccessful A/R when airlifting DOE/NNSA
   SNM cargo, support bases and pre-coordinated emergency divert locations identified in the
   Mission Setup Message will stand by to support emergency diverts until released by 618
   AOC (TACC)/XOC.
       2.3.3.1. Ensure the pre-coordinated emergency divert location is prepared to receive an
       aircraft in the event of an emergency divert. Should the A/R be aborted, 618 AOC
       (TACC) will notify the pre-coordinated emergency divert location and confirm host
       nation notification/coordination.
   2.3.4. If the Aircraft Commander determines at any time that the planned A/R is not
   necessary, they must cancel A/R at the earliest opportunity. The Aircraft Commander’s
   decision is final.
   2.3.5. A/R over open ocean areas at least 12 nautical miles (NM) off shore.
 12                                                                 AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013


         2.3.5.1. The A/R must be accomplished as safely, efficiently, and expediently as
         possible.
             2.3.5.1.1. Accomplish only those maneuvers required for transferring the mission
             required fuel. Example: Receiving the required onload from the primary tanker only,
             or from multiple tankers if a split onload was planned IAW 2.3.2.1. Additional
             events during A/R beyond those necessary to onload required fuel, including training
             by tanker and/or receiver crews, are prohibited at all times.
             2.3.5.1.2. Do not conduct A/R upgrade training on missions carrying DOE/NNSA
             SNM cargo.
             2.3.5.1.3. If the Aircraft Commander is a current Instructor or Evaluator in the
             aircraft, they may refuel from either seat, regardless of who is occupying the other
             seat.
         2.3.5.2. Current and qualified Aircraft Commander certified pilots may perform air
         refueling on DOE/NNSA SNM cargo-laden missions, provided the designated mission
         Aircraft Commander is occupying the other seat.
      2.3.6. The Aircraft Commander will provide the post-A/R report to the controlling C2 cell
      via appropriate means within 15 minutes after completing an A/R.
         2.3.6.1. Do not attempt to contact the crew in flight to determine successful completion
         of the A/R unless no message has been received from the crew after 15 minutes past the
         anticipated completion of the air refueling. Contact the crew if a high priority message or
         emergency order must immediately be transmitted. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD planners
         or XOCG will notify the appropriate pre-coordinated emergency divert location and
         release ground support personnel after the A/R is successfully completed.
2.4. Mission Planning/Coordination.
      2.4.1. Cargo Clearances. The DOE/NNSA will transmit cargo clearance requests as
      required. A copy of the requests as necessary will be forwarded to the 618 AOC
      (TACC)/XOOOD planners.
      2.4.2. Overflight Clearances. Mission planners will coordinate overflight clearances per
      country specific Letters of Understanding or otherwise as required.
      2.4.3. Diplomatic Clearances. Mission planners will coordinate Diplomatic Clearances as
      required by the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide.
      2.4.4. Plan DOE/NNSA SNM mission itineraries with the utmost care. Consider factors
      such as weather, routing, overflight rights, suitable alternate/emergency airfields, host base
      capabilities, anticipated onload/offload times, fuel requirements, CDT, DOE/NNSA CDD,
      and aircrew fatigue factors.
2.5. Mission Setup Message (Content, Classification, and Distribution).
      2.5.1. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD mission planners will prepare a classified Mission Setup
      Message for all missions transporting DOE/NNSA SNM cargo. 618 AOC planners will send
      the Setup Message at least 15-calendar days before home station departure (See Attachment
      3 for a sample message). Support requirements will be coordinated by secure means at all
      times.
AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013                                                                    13


  2.5.2. The classified Mission Setup Message is the sole source of mission information to
  users and host bases.
  2.5.3. Mission Setup Messages will be classified according to mission destinations and
  overflight classification.
     2.5.3.1. PART I will be unclassified.
     2.5.3.2. PART II will be classified. All paragraph classifications will be marked in
     accordance with DoDM 5200.01, Vol 2, DoD Information Security Program: Marking
     of Classified Information.
  2.5.4. At a minimum, the Mission Setup Message will contain the following information:
     2.5.4.1. PART I Unclassified
         2.5.4.1.1. SAAM Number.
         2.5.4.1.2. Mission Itinerary.
     2.5.4.2. PART II Classified
         2.5.4.2.1. Hazardous Cargo Information. Include hazardous cargo information
         required by AFJI 11-204, Operational Procedures for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous
         Materials, to include all cargo weights, size, and detailed description.
         2.5.4.2.2. Security Requirements
         2.5.4.2.3. Specific station requirements. To preclude misunderstanding by host base
         support personnel, special requirements will be written in plain language with a clear
         and detailed description of the sequence of ground operations.
         2.5.4.2.4. Courier Officer Listing
     2.5.4.3. Information may be added or modified as long as messages are in standard
     format (Attachment 3).
  2.5.5. Distribution of Mission Setup Message
     2.5.5.1. Mission Setup Messages will be distributed to the operating unit, all stations
     (including pre-coordinated emergency divert locations) identified on the mission
     itinerary, Command and Control entities, participating MAJCOMs and COCOMs, Air
     Force, Joint Staff, and DTRA and DOE/NNSA Office of Secure Transportation (OST).
     2.5.5.2. Requests to receive Mission Setup Messages should be made to AMC/A3N.
         2.5.5.2.1. Approved requests will be forwarded to 618 AOC/XOOOD with the
         correct SIPR organizational and/or individual email addresses.
         2.5.5.2.2. Organizations or individuals approved for receipt of the Mission Setup
         Message will annually validate approval by the end of each fiscal year (FYXX).
  2.5.6. Mission Setup Message (Station Support Requirements Acknowledgement and 24-
  Hour Confirmation):
     2.5.6.1. All stations listed on the mission itinerary will send an acknowledgement of
     ability to support/non-support the mission itinerary and/or the applicable special
     requirements listed in Part II of the Mission Setup Message. Note: DOE/NNSA will
 14                                                              AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013


      provide Acknowledgement of Station Support Requirement messages for all locations
      that do not have ability to send receive classified messages.
          2.5.6.1.1. The Acknowledgement of Station Support Requirements message will use
          a standard format. (AF Form 527D)
          2.5.6.1.2. Paragraph 7 of the Mission Setup Message will state when
          acknowledgement needs to be received by the mission planners, operational unit, and
          the 618 AOC/XOCG-DDO2. Mission planners will provide three working days for
          stations to send an acknowledgement to an original Mission Setup Message.
          2.5.6.1.3. A station only needs to send acknowledgement for the most current
          Mission Setup Message, i.e., when a change to a Mission Setup Message is released
          before a station has sent the acknowledgement for the previous message.
      2.5.6.2. A 24-Hour Confirmation of Support Requirements message will be sent by all en
      route stations and pre-coordinated emergency divert locations as listed in the mission
      itinerary. A station with multiple itinerary entries on the same day can be combined on
      one 24-Hour message. A station with a single entry spanning two consecutive days and
      no additional entries on the second day need only send one 24-Hour message. Note:
      DOE/NNSA will provide 24-Hour Confirmation of Support Requirements messages for
      all locations that do not have ability to send receive classified messages.
          2.5.6.2.1. The 24-Hour Confirmation of Support Requirements message will use a
          standard format. (AF Form 527E)
          2.5.6.2.2. The 24-Hour Confirmation of Support Requirements message will be sent
          to the mission planners, operational unit, and 618 AOC/XOCG-DDO2 no later than
          24-Hours prior to station arrival. If 24-Hours prior falls on a non-duty day then the
          message will be sent the first duty day prior. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG-DDO2 will
          make a final voice confirmation of support from the 24-Hour POC listed on the
          acknowledgement and confirmation messages.
          2.5.6.2.3. A station only needs to send a 24-Hour Confirmation of Support message
          for the most current Mission Setup Message, i.e., when a change to a Mission Setup
          Message is released before a station has sent the 24-Hour Confirmation for the
          previous message.
2.6. Changes to Mission Setup Message.
   2.6.1. Changes to Mission Setup Messages must be kept to a minimum. Should changes be
   absolutely necessary the following guidance will apply:
      2.6.1.1. All changes will be coordinated and distributed IAW paragraph 2.5.5. and
      acknowledged IAW para 2.5.6.
      2.6.1.2. Separate messages will be used for each change. Change messages will be in the
      original format with a clear statement advising the reason for change and all changes will
      clearly identify the information that is changed.
      2.6.1.3. Changes will not be generated solely to correct non-critical typographical errors.
      Write-in changes to Mission Setup Messages are not permitted.
   2.6.2. Requesting Changes to the Mission Setup Message.
AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013                                                                      15


      2.6.2.1. Requests to change a mission setup must come from the requesting unit’s
      Wg/CC or higher and be submitted to the AOC mission planners for coordination. The
      DOE/NNSA OST can provide this function for missions transporting other DOE/NNSA
      cargo.
      2.6.2.2. Stations that submit a non-support acknowledgement message will also send a
      request for change to the Setup Message.
      2.6.2.3. Requests to change the mission itinerary by greater than 2 hours will not be
      accepted within 10 days of mission execution.
      2.6.2.4. Missions enter execution 24-Hours prior to scheduled home station departure
      and are complete after the last active leg of the mission itinerary. Changes to the mission
      setup will be issued automatically for the following:
          2.6.2.4.1. Mission is delayed more than 2 hours by maintenance, weather, or other
          factors.
          2.6.2.4.2. Change to cargo information that does not impact the itinerary or timing
          beyond 2 hours.
          2.6.2.4.3. Aircraft Divert
          2.6.2.4.4. A change will not be issued solely to cancel an A/R.
   2.6.3. Waiver authority for requests made within 10 days prior to execution will be the 618
   AOC (TACC)/CC. Note: Waiver requests that do not contain the following information
   below will be denied:
      2.6.3.1. Name, grade, unit and title of requester.
      2.6.3.2. Date of request.
      2.6.3.3. Mission number of affected mission.
      2.6.3.4. Detailed reason the change is necessary.
      2.6.3.5. Date and time the required change was discovered.
   2.6.4. When changes to the itinerary are necessary after a mission has started, 618
   AOC/XOCG-DDO2 will coordinate with 618 AOC mission planners to publish changes to
   the Mission Setup Message and forward to the aircrew with an information copy to the
   operating wing. To avoid delay of a mission, voice confirmation of changes between 618
   AOC/XOCG-DDO2 and the aircrew are acceptable but should be used as a last resort only.
   Changes to the Mission Setup Message will be forwarded to all stations and the operating
   wing using the format in Attachment 3.
2.7. Additional Airlift Requirements.
   2.7.1. If changes to DOE/NNSA SNM cargo are approved before the mission starts, the
   Mission Setup Message will be changed through normal channels via procedures listed in
   paragraph 2.6.
   2.7.2. Attachment 2 lists the types of DOE/NNSA materials and associated handling
   requirements. Any changes to the Economy Act must be coordinated between 618 AOC
16                                                                  AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013


     (TACC)/XOOOD and the DOE/NNSA. Coordination must be accomplished as soon as
     additional cargo is identified.
     2.7.3. Only DOE/NNSA SNM cargo identified in the Mission Setup Message and Airlift
     Request may be accepted.
        2.7.3.1. If a discrepancy is identified between the DOE/NNSA SNM cargo or the
        Economy Act, contact the AOC mission planners through the Consolidated Control
        Center (CCC). The AOC will immediately contact the DOE/NNSA POC to resolve any
        discrepancies. The DOE/NNSA POC will identify to the AOC acceptable actions, e.g.
        serial number of cargo transposed. The DOE/NNSA POC will recommend if the
        DOE/NNSA SNM cargo should be accepted by AMC Courier or should remain at the
        shipping unit and transported on a future mission. The Courier retains the ultimate
        authority to accept or deny DOE/NNSA SNM cargo.
        2.7.3.2. If DOE/NNSA POC, AOC, and the aircrew resolve the discrepancy and the
        decision is made to move the DOE/NNSA SNM cargo, the DOE/NNSA POC will issue a
        new Economy Act and the AOC will issue a new SAAM Setup Message. The aircrew
        will attempt to attain a hard copy of the Airlift Request/Economy Act and Setup Message
        before departure. If unable to attain a hard copy due to operational restrictions (i.e. at a
        foreign installation), the aircrew may continue the mission after receiving an unclassified
        email confirmation. Use a voice confirmation as a last resort.
        2.7.3.3. If a discrepancy is identified at the arrival/offload location, it will be resolved
        prior to offloading DOE/NNSA SNM cargo.
     2.7.4. Cargo:
        2.7.4.1. Opportune cargo may be carried on unsanitized positioning legs, but do not
        change the route of flight to solely accommodate the movement of cargo.
        2.7.4.2. Unused space aboard DOE/NNSA SNM cargo missions may be used for general
        cargo if:
            2.7.4.2.1. The DOE/NNSA user authorizes the cargo to be aboard.
            2.7.4.2.2. Extra landings will not be required.
            2.7.4.2.3. The added weight will not cause problems with required fuel, aircraft
            center of gravity (CG), etc.
            2.7.4.2.4. It is compatible and packaged IAW AFJAM 24-204.
            2.7.4.2.5. It will not cause additional handling and movement of DOE/NNSA SNM
            cargo. General cargo (if jettisonable) must be loaded so it may be jettisoned, if
            necessary, without disturbing the DOE/NNSA SNM cargo. Note: Time permitting
            aircrews should jettison general cargo before jettisoning DOE/NNSA SNM cargo,
            and unclassified cargo before classified cargo.
            2.7.4.2.6. It will not cause security problems, including aerial port onloading and
            offloading.
            2.7.4.2.7. Cargo is thoroughly searched and sanitized before loading aboard the
            aircraft.
AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013                                                                        17


          2.7.4.2.8. After search and sanitization, it is stored in a secure manner.
2.8. Passengers, Mission Essential Personnel, and Flying Crew Chief.
   2.8.1. Passengers may only be carried on mission segments in which the aircraft is empty or
   only carrying general cargo. Do not carry passengers while DOE/NNSA SNM is aboard.
   This does not include DOE/NNSA personnel who are manifested as duty passengers. The
   crew will manifest all passengers. The Aircraft Commander will file copy of passenger
   manifest with most responsible on-scene agency.
      2.8.1.1. DOE/NNSA personnel who fly on DOE/NNSA SNM movements will be
      manifested as duty passengers. These individuals will accompany the aircrew to/from
      onload/offload locations. In-flight duties will include, but are not limited to, ensuring the
      cargo remains at safe radiation levels during transport. When transporting DOE/NNSA
      SNM cargo requiring radiation monitoring, DOE/NNSA will ensure appropriate
      personnel accompany the mission to perform this function.
      2.8.1.2. DOE/NNSA personnel requiring airlift on DOE/NNSA SNM missions will be
      identified by the DOE/NNSA NLT ten days prior to mission execution. The Field
      Operations Officer or designee from the Office of Secure Transportation (OST) will
      provide a listing with individual information. For questions contact: Office: (505) 845-
      4180/4448/5071 or STE: (505) 845-4180/6262/4867.
   2.8.2. Mission Essential Personnel (MEP)
      2.8.2.1. MEPs must meet the basic requirements of AFI 11-2C-17 Vol 3, MCI 11208,
      Tanker/Airlift Operations, and AFI 11-401, Aviation Management. Commanders at all
      levels must rigidly minimize the number of extra people on DOE/NNSA SNM missions
      and inside DOE/NNSA SNM mission exclusion areas.
          2.8.2.1.1. Individuals requesting MEP authorization will provide the approving
          authority their SSN, security clearance, PRP status, specific mission for which MEP
          is requested, and reason for participating in the mission. This information must be
          provided to the operating wing a minimum of ten days prior to home station
          departure.
          2.8.2.1.2. MEP procedures and approval will be IAW AFI 11-401. MEP authority is
          granted for specific individuals on particular missions. MEP authority will not be
          used as blanket approval on all DOE/NNSA SNM airlift missions nor will it
          constitute personnel travel clearance required by the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide.
          2.8.2.1.3. Classify requests appropriately if a specific mission or location is included.
          Approve requests for MEP based on security clearance, need-to-know, space
          available on the aircraft, and valid in-flight or ground duty to perform.
          2.8.2.1.4. Without a specific inflight duty, individuals requesting MEP to observe
          onload and offload operations will not be approved if any other transportation is
          available.
          2.8.2.1.5. Commanders of tasked operating wings and NAFs may authorize MEP
          status for people under their command. All others must be approved by AMC/A3.
18                                                              AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013


        2.8.2.1.6. AMC/A3 validated MEP letters will be transmitted via message from
        AMC/A3N, and approved by the owning Operations Group Commander.
     2.8.2.2. IAW AFI 11-401, the Operations Group Commander is the final authority of
     MEP status on DOE/NNSA SNM airlift missions operated by their wing. MEPs must be
     on official orders, and fall into the following categories:
        2.8.2.2.1. Commanders, supervisors of aircrews and related programs: Vice
        commanders, operations group commanders, deputy operations group commanders,
        and squadron/unit commanders and operations officers.
        2.8.2.2.2. Certified aircrew flight examiners from the operating parent wing or
        MAJCOM.
        2.8.2.2.3. Chiefs of Safety and Nuclear Surety Managers (NSM) from the parent
        wing and MAJCOM performing Nuclear Surety Staff Assistance Visits (NSSAV) or
        augmenting Functional Expert Visits (FEV).
        2.8.2.2.4. AMC nuclear operations staff personnel performing FEVs, augmenting
        NSSAVs, or escorting authorized DVs. Crewmembers and guests are either part of
        the crew or on MEP status, but not both for any given mission day.
        2.8.2.2.5. MAJCOM inspector general, Air Force Inspection Agency (AFIA), Air
        Force Safety Center (AFSEC), Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), and AMC
        Nuclear       Surety      office    inspectors    and      augmentees        conducting
        inspections/observations. Note: AFIA, AMC/IGP, DTRA, and AMC/SEW offices
        are responsible for distributing and maintaining current authorization letters. Updated
        letters will be sent via email which have been digitally signed to AMC/A3N, 618
        AOC (TACC)/XOOOD, 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG and 4 AS/DOOMS offices as
        soon as changes occur to ensure authenticity.
     2.8.2.3. MEP authorization (individual orders or MAJCOM/NAF message) will have the
     approval authority, security clearance, SSN, mission number, and reason for participating
     in the mission. Orders will not specify a particular mission number. Classified mission
     details will be transmitted via classified means (i.e. SIPRnet, Secure Fax, etc.).
     2.8.2.4. Persons traveling as MEP will be briefed by the operating squadron/unit (or
     Aircraft Commander when joining the mission en route) on specific mission information
     needed to accomplish their assigned task. Briefing will include familiarization on
     applicable security and safety standards and emergency procedures.
     2.8.2.5. MEPs must be positively identified by a service or agency official identification
     card.
     2.8.2.6. The aircrew Courier must verify the MEP’s PRP or HRP status prior to
     executing the tasked mission. Certified individuals must have an appropriate annotation
     in their MEP authorization.
        2.8.2.6.1. A valid Two-Person Concept (TPC) team must escort individuals not
        certified under PRP or HRP. Required non-HRP DOE/NNSA personnel may be
        escorted by DoD or DOE personnel, or a combination of both. The DOE/NNSA will
        supply a minimum of two escorts for all required non-HRP individuals.
AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013                                                                        19


        2.8.2.6.2. MEP’s requiring escort by the aircrew must provide the operating wing a
        minimum of ten days notice prior to mission execution to ensure escort officials are
        scheduled for the mission.
     2.8.2.7. Travel orders for MEPs will cite the MEP authority and be presented to aircrew
     before mission operation.
     2.8.2.8. MEP authority provides direct access to the mission aircraft without processing
     through passenger service section; therefore, the aircrew is responsible for manifest and
     anti-hijacking procedures for MEPs. The Loadmaster will annotate all MEPs on a DD
     Form 2131, Passenger Manifest.
     2.8.2.9. MEPs on PRP status and designated by the aircrew Courier may be authorized
     unescorted entry into the restricted area around the aircraft. MEPs certified under PRP
     and knowledgeable in the task to be performed may be used as part of a two-person team.
     2.8.2.10. MEP verification. Aircraft commanders will not allow anyone to fly on a
     DOE/NNSA SNM mission unless they are convinced of the person's identity and the
     legality of their authorization.
        2.8.2.10.1. If there is any doubt or suspicion, regardless of rank or position,
        diplomatically but firmly deny access to the aircraft and cargo.
        2.8.2.10.2. Unless an MEP is personally known, do not accept just a set of orders as
        authorization. Verify and confirm the orders through other channels. For example,
        MAJCOM IG, AFIA, AFSEC, DTRA, and AMC Nuclear Surety inspectors are
        identified on a master inspector’s list/letter that is carried in the aircraft mission kit.
        If required the Aircraft Commander will call outside offices for verification.
  2.8.3. Flying Crew Chiefs (FCC). Flying crew chiefs are not normally required on
  DOE/NNSA SNM missions. FCCs may be scheduled on DOE/NNSA SNM missions at the
  discretion of the operating wing commander.
     2.8.3.1. FCCs need not be PRP certified, but must possess a final Secret security
     clearance. Ensure PRP status is noted on the aircrew entry authority list (EAL).
     2.8.3.2. FCCs will attend the squadron/unit's DOE/NNSA SNM mission briefing. The
     FCC will be briefed individually by the nuclear airlift monitor or designated
     representative before attending the nuclear mission briefing. This briefing must cover
     security precautions and no-lone zone procedures in sufficient detail to prevent
     inadvertent violations by the FCC. Stress safety precautions to include specific
     precautions in Chapter 8.
     2.8.3.3. FCCs will not seal mission aircraft, nor will they be allowed unescorted access
     to aircraft containing DOE/NNSA SNM cargo. Do not leave the FCC in sole custody of
     the aircrew mission kit or aircrew sidearms. Exception: When servicing and
     maintenance are required, the FCC may seal empty SNM mission aircraft. Aircraft will
     be sanitized before subsequent loading of DOE/NNSA SNM cargo.
     2.8.3.4. Flying Crew Chiefs (FCC) will be granted access to DOE/NNSA movements at
     the discretion of the supporting wing.

                                          Chapter 4

                                EN ROUTE OPERATIONS

4.1. General. This Chapter outlines en route operational procedures to be used by aircrews and
command and control centers (CCC). Included are procedures for communications, cargo
loading and offloading, and aircraft emergency diverts.
4.2. Special Considerations When Transporting DOE/NNSA SNM Cargo.
   4.2.1. Aircrew members shall not consume alcoholic beverages within 12 hours of crew
   show time on active legs carrying DOE/NNSA SNM cargo.
   4.2.2. Keep to a minimum the time DOE/NNSA SNM is outside secure storage. Coordinate
   fully with support agencies, shippers, and receivers. Keep them informed of mission
   progress and intentions.
   4.2.3. When DOE/NNSA SNM is aboard, every effort will be made to land on time. It is
   best to arrive at the specified time to ensure all agencies, especially at foreign airfields,
   support arrival.
   4.2.4. Security Alternate Fuel. Include 10,000 pounds security fuel when fuel planning for
   DOE/NNSA SNM movements. Security alternate fuel is designed for all missions to allow
   the Aircraft Commander the option of departure from an immature or deteriorating security
   situation. This is in addition to all other required fuel. Do not offload DOE/NNSA SNM to
   allow for security alternate fuel. General cargo will be offloaded to allow for security
   alternate fuel.
   4.2.5. Flight Planning. Enter "hazardous cargo," "inert devices," or both if applicable and
   the mission number in the "remarks" section of the DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, or in
   the "other information" section of the DD Form 1801, DoD International Flight Plan. Note:
   LLCs with line numbers and certain Type 3 trainers and JTAs are hazardous cargo.
   4.2.6. On air refueled mission segments, use the pre-coordinated emergency divert location
   designated in the Mission Setup Message if at all possible. If a different emergency divert
   location is necessary, inform the controlling CCC as soon as possible so the duty controller
   can advise the new emergency divert location. Before takeoff, the Aircraft Commander must
   ensure the new emergency divert location confirms security is available.
4.3. Firefighting Requirements.
   4.3.1. When possible, have firefighting support immediately available during loading, engine
   starts, and servicing (oxygen and fuel).
   4.3.2. Do not concurrently service when loading/offloading DOE/NNSA SNM material.
4.4. Two-Person Concept (TPC). See AFI 91-104, Nuclear Surety Tamper Control and
Detection Program, for TPC and no-lone zone guidance and DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-
108, Volume 3, Enclosure 9 for exclusion area guidance. In some instances host nation security
procedures may prevent the Courier from establishing a restricted area around the aircraft and
cargo. At a minimum, enforce TPC once the aircrew has possession of the DOE/NNSA SNM.
 24                                                                  AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013


      4.4.1. The aircrew will request the DOE/NNSA representative to provide a brief prior to
      cargo onload on what would constitute an incorrect act or unauthorized procedure on
      DOE/NNSA SNM cargo. While security and TPC are the Courier’s primary responsibility,
      compliance and enforcement are everyone's concern regardless of who has physical
      possession of DOE/NNSA SNM cargo.
   4.4.2. If in a no-lone zone and a person has the opportunity to tamper with or damage
   DOE/NNSA SNM, then at least two authorized persons (called a TPC team) must be present.
   Use careful judgment in permitting a lone team member to be temporarily unobserved while
   performing a specific task when it is unsafe or physically impossible to maintain constant
   visual contact by the other team members. Consider the nature of the task and the time and
   tools required. Note: An individual may enter a lavatory within an exclusion area without
   continuous direct observation by the remaining TPC team.
   4.4.3. Individual Two-Person Concept (TPC) team members must be certified under their
   respective service directed PRP, or DOE/NNSA HRP, program and thoroughly briefed on the
   location of the no-lone zone. They must be familiar with the safety and security
   requirements of the task to be performed. The two person concept team may be a minimum
   of two aircrew members, shippers or receivers, MEPs, DOE/NNSA personnel, Courier or
   guards, or any combination of the above suitable to the task to be performed. Two interim
   certified individuals will not form a Two-Person Concept (TPC) team. A two person concept
   team will escort persons not certified under PRP/HRP. It is the Courier’s responsibility to
   ensure anyone who has access, understands and complies with the rules in the restricted area.
   DOE/NNSA personnel who are on HRP may form their own two-person team when
   accompanying DOE/NNSA SNM during transport status.
      4.4.4. The aircrew is responsible for compliance with the two-person policy.
      4.4.5. The Two-Person Concept (TPC) applies:
         4.4.5.1. When an exclusion area has been established around the aircraft: The
         aircrew/Courier are responsible for enforcing TPC once DOE/NNSA SNM is inside the
         exclusion area. When possible, control entry into the exclusion area with an Entry
         Control Point (ECP) and an Entry Authority List (EAL). The Courier or designated
         vouching authority will designate who may act as an escort official for anyone not on the
         EALs.
         4.4.5.2. RON (DOE/NNSA SNM aboard). If an aircrew Two-Person Concept (TPC)
         team is not inside the area to control access to the DOE/NNSA SNM, the entire restricted
         area, including aircraft interior, is a no-lone zone. In this case, two full-time US Guards,
         military or government civilian will control access to the restricted area and DOE/NNSA
         SNM for the aircrew Courier. When the aircrew re-enters the restricted area and is able
         to control access to DOE/NNSA SNM, the no-lone zone reverts to the entire interior of
         aircraft.
4.5. Cargo Acceptance and Transfer.
      4.5.1. The Courier will accept and transfer custody of DOE/NNSA SNM cargo in
      accordance with T.O. 11N-45-51 and Chapter 6. Only DOE/NNSA SNM cargo identified in
      the Mission Setup Message and Economy Act may be accepted and handled. If cargo differs
      from the Mission Setup Message and Economy Act, follow procedures IAW paragraph 2.7.3.
AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013                                                                       25


   4.5.2. Custody and Physical Possession. Custody of DOE/NNSA SNM cargo is transferred
   upon signing the DD Form 1911 regardless of physical possession. The Courier is
   responsible for the safety and security of each item in their physical possession regardless of
   custody, and conversely, the Courier still has custody of items regardless of physical
   possession.
4.6. Loading and Offloading Procedures.
   4.6.1. The overall responsibility for loading aircraft is vested in the Aircraft Commander
   who will personally monitor all loading operations of DOE/NNSA SNM.
   4.6.2. The aircrew will conduct a preload safety briefing with all parties involved in the
   loading of the DOE/NNSA SNM, to include load team, security forces, and accompanying
   technical escorts.
   4.6.3. The primary mission Loadmaster, in coordination with the Aircraft Commander, will
   direct loading, tie-down, and load distribution of DOE/NNSA SNM.
   4.6.4. Before each onload and offload, the Aircraft Commander and primary mission
   Loadmaster will ensure everyone understands their duties. Shippers or receivers may be
   asked to help, but will be thoroughly briefed and must comply with AMC aircrew procedures
   while cargo is in the crew’s custody or physical possession.
   4.6.5. Aircrew may touch DOE/NNSA SNM cargo as necessary to facilitate onload, offload,
   and inflight duties IAW applicable 1C-17-9. Avoid excessive handling of DOE/NNSA SNM
   cargo. Handle only one item or package of DOE/NNSA SNM cargo at a time. When hand-
   carrying, use both hands if practical.
   4.6.6. Do not load DOE/NNSA SNM when an electrical storm is within 5 miles unless cargo
   would be safer inside the aircraft.
   4.6.7. Loadmaster will determine what cargo is jettisonable. This is a physical determination
   with reference to limitations of AFMAN 24-204(I) or 1C-17-9. Loadmaster will ensure crew
   is aware of all cargo that is non-jettisonable.
4.7. Ground Emergencies.
   4.7.1. If a DOE/NNSA SNM container is dropped during handling and the shipping
   container remains intact, check with the DOE/NNSA representative to ensure item can still
   be shipped.
   4.7.2. If a DOE/NNSA SNM container is dropped or otherwise damaged during handling
   and the shipping container ruptures, take the following steps:
      4.7.2.1. Notify tower or ground control. Direct them to contact the fire department and
      declare a ground emergency.
      4.7.2.2. Evacuate nonessential persons upwind a minimum of 2,500 feet, or more if
      required, or as briefed by DOE/NNSA personnel.
   4.7.3. Security Emergencies:
      4.7.3.1. If confronted with a hostile force, use of deadly force is authorized to protect
      DOE/NNSA SNM.
 26                                                                   AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013


             4.7.3.1.1. Consider any attack on aircraft loaded with DOE/NNSA SNM cargo,
             including a hijacking attempt, as an attack against DOE/NNSA SNM cargo.
             4.7.3.1.2. Should hostages be used to gain access to, as cover for removal, or to
             thwart recovery of DOE/NNSA SNM cargo, the welfare and safety of hostages
             should be considered in determining actions to be taken. However, the presence of
             hostages shall not deter taking decisive, prompt, and effective action that includes
             using deadly force to recover DOE/NNSA SNM cargo and to prevent unauthorized
             access to or removal of DOE/NNSA SNM cargo.
         4.7.3.2. If attacked, take the following actions:
             4.7.3.2.1. Make an immediate takeoff with the cargo if possible.
             4.7.3.2.2. If attack occurs during onload or offload, execute the plan as briefed
             between crew and DOE/NNSA representatives. If the decision is made to load, then
             load the cargo as fast and as safely as possible.
             4.7.3.2.3. If the Aircraft Commander determines the aircraft is airworthy and the taxi
             and departure routes are safer than remaining in place, attempt to make an immediate
             takeoff with the cargo IAW predetermined courses of action.
4.8. Engine Running Onload/Offload (ERO). ERO procedures will not be used on missions
transporting DOE/NNSA SNM.
4.9. Departure Procedures.
   4.9.1. Destination Support Confirmation. Aircraft with any DOE/NNSA SNM cargo aboard
   must not take off until all destinations and pre-coordinated emergency divert locations
   acknowledge that they are capable of meeting security requirements. Before beginning each
   day's operation, check with the MAJCOM CCC and/or the DOE/NNSA Field Operations
   Officer or designee from the Office of Secure Transportation (OST) for the status of stations
   to be transited that day. CCC will review the mission folder to ensure all stations on the
   day's itinerary have confirmed security and support requirements. CCC will use all other
   sources available, e.g., airfield threat security evaluations file, etc., to evaluate the security
   status of en route stations. CCC must be prepared to rapidly appraise security for a
   DOE/NNSA mission and provide any changes to the crew immediately. If security is
   questionable or an acknowledgment message has not been received, CCC will immediately
   attempt to confirm security, holding departure to the suspect station until security is
   confirmed. If the 24-Hour confirmation of support message is not available, call the
   DOE/NNSA Field Operations Officer or designee from the Office of Secure Transportation
   (OST) directly. The AOC can help provide base contacts and telephone numbers.
      4.9.2. Engine-Start Notification. Before engine-start, give the controlling agency (ground or
      tower) the parking location, approximate engine-start time, and announce there is hazardous
      cargo aboard the aircraft. Ensure a fire truck is standing by the aircraft for engine start when
      possible.
      4.9.3. Departure Message:
         4.9.3.1. Once airborne, the aircrew will contact the CCC directly via aircraft radio or
         phone patch with their departure time and estimated time of arrival (ETA).
AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013                                                                         27


      4.9.3.2. For missions with short en route times or several quick stops that would make
      departure calls to destinations impractical, CCC may phone destinations before aircraft is
      airborne.
      4.9.3.3. If the mission will not arrive on time (+/- 15 mins) at the offload station as a
      result of a late departure, contact 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD and have them contact one
      of the following: Senior Aviation Official for DOE/NNSA, Office: (202) 586-6177, Cell:
      (301) 602-3139; The Office of Secure Transportation (OST) Transportation and
      Emergency Control Center (TECC): 1-800-428-0496 (For CONUS arrivals, the OST
      TECC will contact the convoy personnel so they are ready to provide security and receive
      the cargo upon arrival); or other installation/agency POCs as necessary.
4.10. CCC Coordination.
   4.10.1. The aircrew transporting DOE/NNSA SNM cargo must keep 618 AOC
   (TACC)/XOCG advised of mission progress. If ETA changes by more than 15 minutes, the
   arrival destination must be informed as soon as possible.
   4.10.2. Releasing Pre-coordinated Emergency Divert Locations.
      4.10.2.1. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD will develop Mission Setup Message support
      requirements for applicable pre-coordinated emergency divert locations. Bases will be
      tasked to support the unlikely event of an emergency divert for any reason (ex: Weather,
      A/R, maintenance, etc.). 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD will coordinate with the operating
      unit during mission planning to establish standby posture requirements and key time
      points/related mission milestones (completion of A/R, ETP passage, etc.).
      4.10.2.2. The Aircraft Commander will contact the 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG-DDO2
      when passed the key time points/related mission milestones. Upon concurrence with the
      Aircraft Commander, 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG-DDO2 will contact the pre-coordinated
      emergency divert location command post to release the installation’s standby
      requirements.
   4.10.3. Aircraft Divert. The Aircraft Commander will inform 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG as
   soon as possible after coordinating any divert with air traffic control agencies. 618 AOC
   (TACC)/XOCG will notify the pre-coordinated emergency divert location, appropriate en
   route agencies, host nation authorities, and the original destination to advise them the aircraft
   is diverting.
4.11. Arrival Procedures.
   4.11.1. If there is a U.S. presence, contact the destination with ETA when 30-minutes from
   the airfield.
   4.11.2. Security. Immediately upon block-in, the Courier designated aircrew members will
   deplane. Keep doors closed and delay preparation for DOE/NNSA SNM transfer until
   adequate security is established.
      4.11.2.1. The Courier designated aircrew members may wear weapons off the aircraft if
      the host nation permits. If weapons are worn off the aircraft, ensure they are exposed
      unless the host nation objects. Otherwise, deploy the Courier team unarmed.
 28                                                              AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013


       4.11.2.2. When the Courier designated aircrew members deplane unarmed, those
       crewmembers not occupying primary crew positions (P, CP, LM) shall arm and remain in
       the aircraft. Crew duties permitting, personnel inside the aircraft should attempt to
       maintain visual contact with the Courier team so they are aware of any unsafe condition.
4.12. Divert to Alternate Airfield.
   4.12.1. If pre-coordinated emergency divert locations cannot be used, alternate locations
   may be considered according to the following:
       4.12.1.1. Be under US military control.
       4.12.1.2. Have adequate security.
       4.12.1.3. Have a nuclear storage capability. Consider the type of cargo to be handled.
       Alternative is to leave DOE/NNSA SNM aboard aircraft during entire ground time,
       which might be unacceptable from a security, maintenance, or host base or theater point
       of view.
   4.12.2. If aircraft maintenance is a problem, consider maintenance capability at the alternate
   location. Security support and nuclear storage capability, however, are the most important
   factors.
   4.12.3. If the divert location is in CONUS or a US military base in a foreign country, use the
   following guidance:
       4.12.3.1. Have controlling CCC relay hazardous cargo information and coordinate
       arrangements for security, storage, etc. Give 30­minute in-flight notification.
       4.12.3.2. If unable to contact CCC or if CCC cannot contact alternate base, request
       security forces meet the aircraft in the 30-minute notification call.
       4.12.3.3. Use of bases should be considered to best meet mission needs, e.g., security,
       maintenance problems, etc.
   4.12.4. If the airfield is in a foreign country, but not under US military control, contact
   controlling CCC and relay the aircraft call sign, mission number, aircraft type, airport of
   intended landing, ETA, and reason for the emergency divert. Request assistance from
   nearest Air Force base, American Embassy, or consulate. Also contact the Office of Secure
   Transportation (OST) Transportation and Emergency Control Center (TECC): 1-800-428-
   0496. Landing in any foreign country is extremely sensitive and will be handled as quietly as
   possible with the agency controlling the field. Keep mission as inconspicuous as possible
   while still protecting DOE/NNSA SNM. Use procedures in the DoD Foreign Clearance
   Guide (FCG) to protect the sensitivity of the mission, which states, "US military aircraft are
   sovereign instrumentalities.” When cleared to overfly or land in foreign territory, it is US
   policy to assert that military aircraft are entitled to privileges and immunities, which
   customarily are accorded warships. These privileges and immunities include, in the absence
   of stipulations to the contrary, exemption from duties and taxation; immunity from search,
   seizure, and inspections (including customs and safety inspections); or other exercise of
   jurisdiction by the host nation over aircraft, personnel, equipment, or cargo aboard. Air
   Force Aircraft Commanders will not authorize search, seizure, inspection, or similar
   exercises of jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authorities except by direction of Air
   Force headquarters or the American Embassy in the country concerned. Diplomatically, but
AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013                                                                        29


   firmly, deny any access to aircraft by foreign officials and attempt to have US officials in the
   country resolve the problem.
4.13. Emergency Procedures. During any emergency, aircrew must take every precaution to
protect lives and property. The following emergency procedures apply:
   4.13.1. Pass the following information to appropriate ATC agency with request it be passed
   to the divert location:
      4.13.1.1. The nature of the emergency and landing intentions.
      4.13.1.2. Aircraft position and ETA to destination.
      4.13.1.3. Number of personnel aboard and their location.
      4.13.1.4. Fuel aboard.
      4.13.1.5. Hazardous cargo is aboard.
   4.13.2. Make a 30-minute prior-to-arrival radio call to the destination base to include:
      4.13.2.1. A description of the physical appearance and location in the aircraft of the
      DOE/NNSA SNM.
   4.13.3. If an emergency requires an immediate landing and the Aircraft Commander must
   choose between communication security and flight safety, then safety will take precedence.
   Classified information may be disclosed only to the extent necessary for safety of flight.
   4.13.4. Jettisoning DOE/NNSA SNM. The Loadmaster will identify which cargo is and is
   not jettisonable. In an emergency, the Aircraft Commander bears moral obligation to jettison
   cargo or crash-land where the least amount of damage will result. Record coordinates of
   each jettisoned item.
4.14. Border Procedures.
   4.14.1. Purpose. To give aircrews border clearance procedures when carrying DOE/NNSA
   SNM.
   4.14.2. Policy and Procedures.      Border clearance is the responsibility of the Aircraft
   Commander.
      4.14.2.1. Use general border clearance procedures in governing AFI 11-2C-17, Vol 3.
      4.14.2.2. Prepare cargo manifests (DD Form 1385, Cargo Manifest) for customs officials
      on all cargo. The shipper will supply manifests for unclassified non-nuclear cargo.
      Loadmasters will prepare manifests for DOE/NNSA SNM cargo and other classified
      cargo. List this cargo as classified material, classified cargo, hazardous material,
      classified test equipment, or similar wording which best describes it. Descriptions must
      not associate cargo with nuclear material. These manifests must include number of units,
      weight, and cubic displacement in feet.
      4.14.2.3. Waivers of Customs and Quarantine Boarding. A letter will be prepared and
      reproduced in the format depicted in Attachment 4.2. with appropriate organizational
      letterhead.
 30                                                                  AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013


      4.14.3. The Aircraft Commander will tactfully request US customs and agriculture
      quarantine inspectors accept a waiver for boarding and examination of aircraft because of the
      classified cargo aboard.
         4.14.3.1. If waiver is denied and the aircraft is at an enroute location, the Aircraft
         Commander will request a "permit to proceed" to the final destination.
         4.14.3.2. If the waiver or “permit to proceed” is denied, the inspectors will be escorted
         using a TPC team.
      4.14.4. When filing a flight plan into a base that does not have customs or agriculture
      quarantine inspectors readily available, request customs and/or agriculture inspectors meet
      the aircraft by contacting the arrival base command post/AMCC. Determine hours of
      operations of customs facilities and comply with any requirements for advance notification.
      In a divert situation, give as much lead-time as possible to arrange for customs and
      agriculture inspectors.
4.15. Crew Rest Procedures. Before entering crew rest at an en route station, the Aircraft
Commander will ensure the aircraft is sealed (as required). Provide command post and AOC
contact information during crew rest in the case of an emergency.
4.16. Itinerary Deviation.
      4.16.1. As soon as it is apparent a mission will deviate from published itinerary, notify the
      appropriate CCC of ETA for remaining en route stations on that day's itinerary. CCC will
      immediately notify destination or DOE/NNSA points of contact and appropriate diplomatic
      clearance authorities by telephone. Passing timely and accurate information to destination is
      extremely important.
      4.16.2. If a mission deviates by two or more hours from last published itinerary, the CCC
      will coordinate with the Aircraft Commander and XOOOD mission planning to send a
      mission change message (Attachment 3). Points of contact at bases scheduled to be transited,
      the pre-coordinated emergency divert location, and tanker unit (if applicable), and
      appropriate en route agencies will also be advised by secure means of new times. Do not
      launch until CCC and/or DOE/NNSA has determined subsequent stations for that day can
      accept the mission in accordance with the revised plan. If the aircrew coordinates directly
      with the shipper or receiver, advise CCC.
      4.16.3. Mission Change Message:
         4.16.3.1. The mission planning section will coordinate mission change message with the
         Aircraft Commander. Attempt to return mission to its original itinerary by adjusting
         ground times if possible. Do not sacrifice proper crew rest to return to the original
         schedule; however, do not perpetuate small delays by using originally planned ground
         times if less time will provide adequate crew rest.
         4.16.3.2. The Aircraft Commander will relay revised information to CCC. CCC is
         responsible for checking times for conflicts with other missions, notifying the pre-
         coordinated divert location, tanker unit (if applicable), appropriate en route agencies, and
         remaining bases. The mission planning section will draft and send any message traffic
         required. Take care to ensure classified information is not compromised.
AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013                                                                   31


     4.16.3.3. Use Attachment 3, format, and classify the mission change message the same
     as original Mission Setup Message. Include hazardous cargo information if changed
     from the Setup Message.
     4.16.3.4. Include all addressees in the Mission Setup Message including the aircrew’s
     current location, divert locations, and remaining bases. Omit stations already transited.
  4.16.4. Unscheduled Hot RON. Mission delays may force the aircrew into an unscheduled
  Hot RON. If it becomes apparent to an Aircraft Commander the crew will not be able to
  proceed to the next destination and complete the offload within remaining CDT, he or she
  will immediately contact AMC CCC and request authority for either:
     4.16.4.1. An extension to crew duty day.
     4.16.4.2. Permission to offload cargo and attempt the mission at a later time.
     4.16.4.3. Permission to Hot RON at current location, emergency divert location, or
     destination airfield. Do not proceed to destination if the mission will arrive without
     sufficient time to complete offload (if one is planned) unless destination base has
     confirmed through CCC they can support the Hot RON.               At USAFE bases,
     USAFE/A3/10 approval is required for a Hot RON. CCC will coordinate Hot RON
     requests through USAFE/A3/10NM.

                                             Chapter 5

                                            SECURITY

5.1. General. This Chapter describes the security standards for DOE/NNSA SNM cargo,
aircraft sanitization, EALs, and emergency security actions IAW DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN
31-108.
5.2. Types of Security. The degree of security protection will vary according to the cargo.
DoD security requirements are broken into two categories, Type I security and Type II security.
Refer to DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108 for a full description of Type I and Type II
security. Note: When discussing security requirements with another service, a detailed
description may be necessary.
5.3. Protection Standards. During transport of Cat I quantities of SNM, DOE/NNSA provides
the equivalent of Type I security offered to all DoD nuclear weapons and warheads. Aircrew
will ensure security meets DoD and Air Force standards when transporting DOE/NNSA SNM
cargo.
5.4. Security Procedures. DOE/NNSA SNM shall be provided the following security while it
is in DoD custody:
   5.4.1. If possible, control access to the aircraft by establishing a secure area using temporary
   physical barriers. Where temporary physical barriers are not available, try to use additional
   guards, patrols, or other security measures.
   5.4.2. When possible, control entry into the restricted area with an Entry Control Point
   (ECP) and an Entry Authority List (EAL). The Courier or designated vouching authority
   will designate who may act as an escort official for anyone not on the EALs.
      5.4.3. Realize security provided by foreign agencies will not look like security provided by
      the USAF or DOE/NNSA. Foreign shipping and receiving agencies are required by
      International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regulation to provide the appropriate level of
      security to DOE/NNSA SNM.
      5.4.4. Provide lights, when available, to discourage unauthorized entry and to aid in the
      detection of intruders approaching or attempting to gain entry into the secure area. Position
      lighting to prevent glare from blinding guards and to avoid silhouetting or highlighting
      guards and aircraft. Where this lighting is not practical, compensate with additional guards,
      posts, patrols, controls, or other security measures to be determined by the security forces.
      5.4.5. Communications. Aircraft guards should have at least two means of alerting a
      communications control center, or controlling ground agency at civilian airfields.
   5.4.6. Contraband is defined in DoD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108. Aircrews transporting
   DOE/NNSA SNM are authorized government issued and personal cell phones, computers,
   other electronics devices, and other general cargo. Aircrew should minimize the number of
   devices used to accomplish the mission and will comply with AFMAN 91-201 or specific
   Nuclear Certification Impact Statement requirements. The aircrew Courier remains the
   ultimate authority for all equipment allowed to be in the exclusion area. Government and
   personal electronic devices must meet the following conditions:
AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013                                                                      33


     5.4.6.1. Government issued cell phones, computers, and other electronic devices
     assigned to C-17 aircrew are authorized to be used aboard the aircraft if the systems
     perform a unique, mission-essential function. However, if a system performs a backup or
     redundant function, it will not be used unless the primary system(s) are not functioning.
     If not required for mission execution as previously stated, the equipment will be turned
     off, battery removed (if possible), and remain stowed on the aircraft when nuclear cargo
     is aboard.
     5.4.6.2. Personal cell phones, computers, and other electronic devices carried by C-17
     aircrew are authorized to be used aboard the aircraft if the government issued electronic
     equipment is not functioning. If not required for mission execution as previously stated,
     the equipment will be turned off, battery removed (if possible), and remain stowed on the
     aircraft when nuclear cargo is aboard. If the battery cannot be removed, the item will be
     placed in an approved Radio Frequency Shielded Bag and stowed.
  5.4.7. Sealing Aircraft. Normally, seal DOE/NNSA SNM mission aircraft during crew rests
  and extended en route delays. During RONs at normal AMC maintenance airfields, sealing
  is at the discretion of the Aircraft Commander. If sealing for maintenance or non-security
  purposes, make every effort to comply with host base security procedures, but as a minimum
  have two aircrew members verify all seals and record the seal number.
     5.4.7.1. If sealing for security purposes, and security forces are available to provide
     security, have the senior security force representative verify seals during sealing and
     opening the aircraft. Each time aircrew or other authorized persons enter the aircraft, the
     aircraft will be resealed by aircrew or other authorized persons when they depart.
     5.4.7.2. Tape emergency escape hatches, paratroop doors, maintenance/ditching hatches,
     etc., on the interior to show evidence of forced or unauthorized entry. The crew entrance
     door(s) and any under floor access will be closed and sealed by a serialized security seal.
     5.4.7.3. After the crew door has been sealed, wipe the area clean around the seal and
     provide the seal number to security forces and command post, as required.
     5.4.7.4. Upon return, verify seal numbers with security forces, if able, and inspect seals
     inside the aircraft with one other aircrew member.
     5.4.7.5. In the event of forced entry or evidence that seals on aircraft have been tampered
     with:
         5.4.7.5.1. Ensure all evidence remains untouched.
         5.4.7.5.2. If on a U.S. installation, report the incident to base command post, security
         forces, and the Office of Special Investigations (OSI). Request immediate
         investigation. Otherwise, contact the Office of Secure Transportation (OST)
         Transportation and Emergency Control Center (TECC): 1-800-428-0496, for
         guidance.
         5.4.7.5.3. When DOE/NNSA SNM is aboard ensure HAZMAT team (when
         available) and DOE/NNSA personnel make appropriate inspections. If inspections
         cannot be made, notify C2 and the ultimate receiver.
 34                                                                   AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013


             5.4.7.5.4. After investigation is complete and aircraft is released by HAZMAT team,
             DOE/NNSA, and security forces (when available) perform a thorough preflight and
             depart.
5.5. Sanitized Aircraft. Sanitize aircraft before carrying DOE/NNSA SNM cargo. Sanitization
is a thorough check for unauthorized explosives or stowaways and should be done at the most
logical station, normally at the first onload location. It can also be accomplished at an en route
station when several stops are made before onloading DOE/NNSA SNM cargo. When approved
by the Aircraft Commander and Courier officer and coordinated with host base, Type II security
may be dropped for an empty aircraft during RON. Aircraft will be provided random checks by
security forces as a PL3 resource. Before loading DOE/NNSA SNM cargo, aircraft will be
sanitized, a restricted area re-established, and security provided.
      5.5.1. Sanitization Procedures. Aircrews will conduct a thorough visual inspection and
      appropriate aircraft dash-1 preflight or through-flight inspection to search for explosives,
      suspicious devices or packages, or unauthorized persons. When available, an explosive
      detection dog (EDD) or portable explosive detection devices will be used to sanitize the
      aircraft and crew baggage. Do not delay the mission if an EDD is not available. If a
      suspicious device or explosives are found during the aircrew search, cordon off the area and
      request response of a certified EOD team. During periods of inclement weather, crew bags
      may be sanitized inside the aircraft.
      5.5.2. If an aircraft is changed during the mission the new aircraft must be sanitized.
      5.5.3. Providing Type II security on a sanitized aircraft maintains the sanitization, and
      precludes the need to re-sanitize before loading DOE/NNSA SNM cargo. Note: Consider
      removing Type II security if extended servicing or maintenance is required. Resanitize
      before onloading DOE/NNSA SNM cargo if Type II requirements are removed.
         5.5.3.1. The aircraft will be sealed.
         5.5.3.2. Type II security will be maintained (not required if aircraft is parked in a
         designated "PL1" restricted area, e.g., an AFGSC alert area).
         5.5.3.3. Only the aircrew (not including the crew chief) are authorized unescorted access
         to the aircraft.
         5.5.3.4. Security personnel are informed that Type II security material is aboard. Note:
         Do not request security support merely to guard the Aircrew Mission Kit (security forces
         do not guard classified material unless associated with the required priority level).
AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013                                                                       35

                          CUSTODY TRANSFER PROCEDURES

6.1. General. The Courier is final authority for cargo security, except during airborne
emergencies when the Aircraft Commander rules that safety-of-flight is paramount. The Courier
retains the ultimate authority to accept or deny DOE/NNSA SNM cargo.
6.2. Courier Designation and Certification. Identify Couriers to shippers in writing.
Identification will include the Courier's name, rank, and security clearance. Normally, this
identification is in the Mission Setup Message; however, it may be a separate message sent by
AOC mission planners via email after they validate the information. This may occur when
Couriers are replaced during mission execution. Verify the Courier’s identification by using the
Common Access Card (CAC). Note: "Identification of an Official Courier Letter" (Attachment
4.1) is for use during border clearance and does not satisfy any of the above requirements.
6.3. Persons Authorized to Sign for DOE/NNSA SNM. The DOE/NNSA publishes a list of
people who are qualified to sign for DOE/NNSA SNM. This list is called the “DOE/NNSA
Authorized Recipient/Certification List.” This list of federal agents will be used to authenticate
the DOE/NNSA convoy personnel. The Courier will have the list NLT ten days prior to mission
execution. Note: The Field Operations Officer or designee from the Office of Secure
Transportation (OST) will provide a listing with individual information. For questions contact:
Office: (505) 845-4180/4448/5071 or STE: (505) 845-4180/6262/4867.
6.4. Cargo Inspection. Before accepting and loading DOE/NNSA SNM, the Courier,
DOE/NNSA representative, and primary Loadmaster will inspect cargo. Inspect containers,
container numbers, and any seals or seal numbers that may exist. Air Force Courier will make
note of any obvious damage to DOE/NNSA SNM cargo. Deficiencies affecting safety must be
corrected before accepting cargo. The Courier retains the ultimate authority to accept or deny
DOE/NNSA SNM cargo.
6.5. Custody Transfer. The custody transfer of all DOE/NNSA SNM will be as follows:
   6.5.1. CONUS departure with U.S. delivering material to foreign nation:
DOE/NNSA Federal Agent/Representative → Aircrew → DOE/NNSA Federal
Agent/Representative → Receiving Agency
   6.5.2. OCONUS departure with U.S. recovering material from foreign nation:
Shipping Agency → DOE/NNSA Federal Agent/Representative → Aircrew → DOE/NNSA
Federal Agent/Representative
   6.5.3. The DD Form 1911 will be used for all custody transfers between the DOE/NNSA
   and the DoD.
6.6. Courier Responsibilities. The Courier is responsible for receipt, custody, security, safety,
and delivery of DOE/NNSA SNM cargo to authorized receivers. Specific responsibilities
include:
   6.6.1. Have written instructions that specify DOE/NNSA SNM cargo to be shipped (Mission
   Setup Message/Economy Act).
 36                                                                   AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013


      6.6.2. Have a list of authorized receivers.
      6.6.3. Document minor damage, e.g. scratches, scrapes, small dents, etc., in the remarks
      section of the DD Form 1911. Have the shipper initial entry.
      6.6.4. Inspect all containers to verify condition of seals. Request the shipper replace any
      broken or missing seals. Have the shipper verify the condition of the seals for palletized
      LLCs. If broken or missing seals cannot be replaced and the integrity of the container is
      suspect, reject the container. If the container is accepted with broken or missing seals and the
      integrity is not suspect, annotate the exact condition on DD Form 1911.
      6.6.5. DOE/NNSA SNM cargo presented for shipment must be exactly as described by the
      Mission Setup Message and Airlift Request. If cargo differs from the Mission Setup
      Message and Airlift Request, follow procedures IAW paragraph 2.7.3.
      6.6.6. Accept custody of DOE/NNSA SNM cargo by signing DD Form 1911 and release
      custody only on signature of positively identified authorized receivers or a replacement
      Courier. Do not sign for cargo that the Courier cannot maintain custody of and/or inspect.
6.7. Documentation. Shippers are required to provide properly completed DD Forms 1911.
Instructions for the forms are in T.O. 11N-45-51. On mission termination at home station, return
completed DD Forms 1911 to the squadron/unit and maintain on file for 6 months.

           SPECIAL NUCLEAR MATERIAL AIRLIFT MISSION SUPPORT

7.1. Command and Control. DOE/NNSA SNM airlift missions place demands on the
command and control system over and above normal operations. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD
mission planners will ensure a "Y" is in the CLOSE WATCH block. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG
will monitor the exact status of each mission. Specific responsibilities are:
   7.1.1. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD mission planners will maintain ready access to the DoD
   FCG, understand overflight procedures and restrictions, and in coordination with tanker
   planning section, coordinate tanker support, and obtain altitude reservation (ALTRV)
   approvals. Flight planning branch will validate computer flight plans (CFP) for compliance
   with the DoD FCG restrictions, EURO Control Route Availability Document (RAD),
   ALTRV routings, and avoid heavily populated areas then transmit to the current C2 system.
   Mission planning section confirms diplomatic clearances and ensures alternates on CFPs are
   capable of supporting DOE/NNSA SNM cargo missions.
   7.1.2. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG will assist Aircraft Commanders in determining the best
   divert location for a DOE/NNSA SNM mission. In accordance with the Mission Setup
   Message and this instruction, notify the selected divert location of all required support
   needed to meet the aircraft when it lands. When the Aircraft Commander informs the 618
   AOC (TACC)/XOCG that he or she has selected a different divert location from the one pre-
   coordinated in the Mission Setup Message, the duty controller must then coordinate with the
   new divert location and advise the pre-coordinated divert location it is no longer under
   consideration as a divert option. When time permits, use guidance for mission change
   message in paragraph 2.6.
   7.1.3. AMC/A7S and 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG will actively monitor security status of
   bases that nuclear airlift missions are scheduled to transit. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD will
   be prepared to confirm each day's itinerary with Aircraft Commanders when they check in.
   Mission Setup Message will request a support confirmation message be sent from each base
   on the itinerary to appropriate CCC 24-hours before arrival at each base. Use this message to
   confirm security before allowing aircraft to proceed. Only attempt contact with the
   destination base to confirm support via non-secure means if the 24-Hour confirmation of
   support message has not been received.
   7.1.4. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD will prepare and send mission change messages IAW
   paragraph 2.6. and 4.16.3 after coordination with the Aircraft Commander. Check for
   conflicts with other missions and include hazardous cargo information if load is changed.
   7.1.5. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOOOD will act as the point of contact between shippers or
   receivers and aircrew during the mission. Pass updates to down line bases as requested by
   the Aircraft Commander.
   7.1.6. 618 AOC (TACC)/XOCG will ensure DOE/NNSA SNM cargo airlift missions
   delayed for maintenance problems get immediate and priority support.
7.2. Intelligence Support. Intelligence support is an essential element of the mission. It
requires constant attention and procedures to successfully ensure cargo safety and security. To

                                   LOGISTICS SUPPORT

8.1. General. This guidance references AFMAN 91-201. It outlines maintenance procedures
for aircraft used to carry DOE/NNSA SNM cargo. Although these regulations establish
guidelines for the movement of nuclear weapons, the same maintenance standards will be met
for aircraft transporting DOE/NNSA SNM. Therefore, the following guidance applies to all
maintenance and operations personnel who support or conduct DOE/NNSA SNM airlift
missions.
8.2. Aircraft Selection and Preparation. Aircraft selected to fly these missions must not have
any uncorrected history of repeat or recurring malfunctions on systems identified as mission
capable in accordance with the Minimum Essential Subsystem Listing (MESL) Air Refueling
Conventional (ARC) and be the most reliable aircraft available for DOE/NNSA SNM. Aircraft
selected for DOE/NNSA SNM must meet the stringent criteria in this paragraph. The criteria are
essential to preclude potential mission delays while the aircraft is in the mobility system.
Missions are extensively coordinated and delays have serious political effects.
   8.2.1. Maintenance Operations Officer/Superintendent has the overall responsibility for
   aircraft selection, aircraft preparation, and maintenance team selection and will:
       8.2.1.1. Coordinate with MOS Plans, Scheduling and Documentation Section to schedule

40                                                                AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013


     cuts of more than 1/2-inch in length will be replaced before DOE/NNSA SNM missions.
     All cuts will be measured from the bottom of the nearest groove at the immediate vicinity
     of the cut. If a cut extends into the cord body, the tire will be replaced as prescribed In
     T.O. 4T-1-3, Inspection, Maintenance Instructions, Storage, And Disposition Of Aircraft
     Tires And Inner Tubes.
     8.2.2.5. Aircraft selected will not have fuel leaks or seepage limits greater than 1/2 of the
     allowable limit in T.O. 1-1-3, Inspection and Repair of Aircraft Integral Tanks, and Fuel
     Cells.
     8.2.2.6. If an aircraft has evidence of a fuel tank fire, the aircraft will not be scheduled
     for or continue on a DOE/NNSA SNM mission.
     8.2.2.7. Aircraft selected will not have hydraulic and oil leakage limits greater than 1/2
     of the allowable limits in mission design series (MDS) specific technical orders.
     8.2.2.8. Consider all available safety and structural enhancements when selecting an
     aircraft.
     8.2.2.9. AFTO Form 781 series forms must be reviewed to ensure no discrepancy exists
     that would keep aircraft from being used on a DOE/NNSA SNM airlift mission, e.g.
     discrepancies with winch, tie-down equipment, rails, etc.
     8.2.2.10. Aircraft engine time changes may be exceeded by 10 percent or 100 hours,
     whichever is greater, as prescribed in T.O. 2-1-18, Aircraft Engine Operating Limits And
     Factors Operating Limits And Pipeline Times.
 8.2.3. Senior Maintenance Representative (SMR). The DOE/NNSA SNM SMR will:
     8.2.3.1. Ensure aircraft are prepared for DOE/NNSA SNM missions.
     8.2.3.2. Review and validate accuracy of aircraft documentation (e.g., aircraft forms,
     GO81 histories, time change items, special inspections, scheduled/unscheduled delayed
     discrepancies, outstanding time compliance technical orders, and engine data trend
     analysis). NOTE: Ensure aircraft documentation is cleared correctly IAW T.O. 00-20-1
     and the MAJCOM supplement.
     8.2.3.3. Check GO81 aircraft histories for completed repeat/recurring maintenance
     actions and required operational checks. Re-verify repeat/recurring discrepancies with
     questionable, incomplete actions or operational checks.
     8.2.3.4. Evaluate appearance, cleanliness, and mechanical condition of the aircraft.
     8.2.3.5. Ensure DOE/NNSA SNM aircraft has a current preflight inspection.
     8.2.3.6. A senior maintenance representative will personally inspect aircraft for
     cleanliness (especially in tie down fitting recesses), proper configuration, and mechanical
     condition.
     8.2.3.7. After aircraft has been prepared and inspected, a SMR will clear the aircraft
     forms by entering the following in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy And
     Work Document Corrective Action Block: "Aircraft prepared in accordance with
     appropriate directives." Until this is done, the aircraft is not mission ready.
AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013                                                                     41

   Maintenance Team will:
      8.2.4.1. Accomplish all inspections, maintenance, and servicing with the most highly
      qualified technicians available. For those aircraft with flying crew chiefs, they must be
      involved in the overall aircraft preparation, to ensure maintenance continuity during
      DOE/NNSA SNM missions.
      8.2.4.2. Perform a preflight as prescribed in 00-20-1 no later than 24-hours before
      mission departure.
      8.2.4.3. Ensure all systems that will be used during the mission are operational in
      accordance with the command weapon system MESL, HSD/ARC.
      8.2.4.4. Check C-17/stabilizing struts for proper operation, servicing, and leaks.
      8.2.4.5. Ensure tie-down fitting receptacles are free of dirt or contaminants allowing
      placement of the 10,000-pound tie-down fitting.            Replace any unserviceable
      receptacles/seat tracks that cannot be repaired in accordance with appropriate technical
      data.
      8.2.4.6. Service winches in accordance with appropriate T.O. guidance.
      8.2.4.7. Aircraft will be properly configured, and all equipment specified by the wing
      operations directives will be aboard, including serviceable engine/inlet covers.

      13C2-1-1, Operation. Maintenance, and Test Instructions for Cargo Tie-Down
      Equipment.
   8.2.5. Required Equipment for aircraft departing home station. The wing supporting
   DOE/NNSA SNM airlift will establish local procedures for ensuring the equipment and
   shoring specified by the aircrew is delivered to the aircraft in sufficient time to allow for
   inventory and receipt before departure, to include but not limited to:
      8.2.5.1. Two grounding wires, each 100 feet long.
      8.2.5.2. Three sets of aircraft chocks (six total) for C-17.
      8.2.5.3. C-17 aircraft will have two cases each of hydraulic fluid and engine oil.
      8.2.5.4. All liquid/gaseous oxygen/nitrogen will be serviced to capacity as prescribed in
      C-17-specific technical orders.
8.3. General Maintenance and Servicing.
   8.3.1. Preflight validity period will be in accordance with T.O. 00-20-1.
   8.3.2. When possible, fuel DOE/NNSA SNM aircraft with low-volatility fuel, compatible
   with aircraft engine operation. Use the best fuel available in this order of precedence:
      8.3.2.1. JP-8.
      8.3.2.2. JP-5.
      8.3.2.3. Commercial Jet A-1 with appropriate anti-ice additives.
      8.3.2.4. JP-4.
 42                                                              AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013


   8.3.3. Fuel servicing guidance for explosive loaded aircraft is contained in T.O. 00-25-172,
   Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding. During initial generation, an
   aircraft shall be refueled before being loaded with DOE/NNSA SNM to reduce the severity
   of a mishap. Cargo aircraft loaded with transportation-configured DOE/NNSA SNM may be
   refueled at aircraft explosive cargo parking areas, commonly called hot cargo pads. If fuel
   servicing is necessary with DOE/NNSA SNM aboard, one Halon 1211 (or local equivalent)
   fire extinguisher is required in the fuel servicing safety zone. When possible, position a
   major fire-fighting vehicle at the aircraft.
   8.3.4. Aircrew will oversee all maintenance activities on aircraft with DOE/NNSA SNM.
   8.3.5. Do not perform maintenance that increases the probability of fire on an aircraft with
   DOE/NNSA SNM aboard. This prohibition includes: using flame-producing or uncontrolled
   heat-producing items; repairing the fuel system, fuel cell, or fuel tanks; performing other
   maintenance where significant fuel spills are likely.
   8.3.6. Complete fuel or oxygen servicing, and any loading of external chaff or flares before
   loading DOE/NNSA SNM.
   8.3.7. Do not load flares or chaff unless required for the DOE/NNSA SNM mission.
   8.3.8. Do not transport replenishment chaff or flares.
   8.3.9. Do not service aircraft during loading or unloading.
8.4. En-route Maintenance.
   8.4.1. Close coordination between MAJCOM CCC, 618 AOC (TACC), maintenance, 618
   AOC (TACC)/XOCL and Aircraft Commander is required at all times, especially when
   DOE/NNSA SNM aircraft have a maintenance problem. The effect on safety and security of
   DOE/NNSA SNM cargo must be considered when coordinating maintenance support. The
   Aircraft Commander's decision is final. Use weapon system MESL to determine status of
   DOE/NNSA DOE/NNSA SNM aircraft. A MOCC senior controller will personally monitor
   maintenance support for DOE/NNSA SNM missions while on their station. Maintenance
   support of DOE/NNSA SNM missions will take precedence over missions with lesser
   priorities.
   8.4.2. When a replacement aircraft is required in the en route system, every effort must be
   made to meet the criteria in paragraph 8.2. An aircraft that best meets the criteria in
   paragraph 8.2 will be selected. Open discrepancies must not adversely affect or delay a
   DOE/NNSA SNM mission. Special aircraft preparation entries in the AFTO Form 781A are
   not required.
   8.4.3. If a fuel tank fire occurs during a DOE/NNSA SNM mission, a replacement aircraft
   will be generated to continue the mission.
8.5. Safety Precautions and Personnel Requirements.
   8.5.1. Perform maintenance only in the presence of the aircrew (or flying crew chief
   accompanying the mission), who will ensure proper safety precautions are used. Take the
   following safety precautions, as well as any others deemed necessary:
AFI13-526V2 14 JUNE 2013                                                                    43


     8.5.1.1. Use only equipment, procedures, and checklists that are consistent with U.S. Air
     Force-approved publications for any operation directly associated with DOE/NNSA
     SNM.
     8.5.1.2. Ground aircraft in accordance with C-17 specific technical orders and T.O. 00-
     25-172.
     8.5.1.3. Aircraft parking areas must satisfy explosive quantity-distance criteria. Consult
     the local explosive safety officer when in doubt.
     8.5.1.4. If cargo compartment access is required, the aircrew must cover the classified
     seals on the DOE/NNSA SNM containers.
