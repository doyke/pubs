SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The Mission Execution
Forecast (MEF) is now referred to as the Mission Weather Product (MWP). Training will now
be conducted IAW AFMAN 15-127, Air Force Weather Qualification Training. Weather Flight
leadership will no longer schedule personnel around airfield hours, but will schedule forecasters
around local flying hours to support mission requirements. Table 2.4. 14 OSS/OSW Duty
Priorities. Table 2.1. has been revised to include new Watch and Warning criteria and wording
IAW AFMAN 15-129V1, Air and Space Weather Operations – Characterization. Figure 2.1.
RM Matrix for Severe Weather Action Procedures, has been revised regarding decision-making

processes to activate the Severe Weather Action Team (SWAT). Table 2.2. Weather Flight
Contact Information, has been revised to reflect correct duty contact information for the Weather
Flight and its members. Paragraph 2.4.1. has been revised to replace “the weather station is
located in the Airfield Management building” with “the Weather Flight is located in the Base
operations building”. Paragraph 2.5. has been revised to replace all references to the OPUP to
GRLevel products (GR2Analyst and GRLevel3). Section 2.6. has been revised to remove NTFS
completely from the wording of this document, as it has been completely replaced by the Joint
Environmental Toolkit (JET). Paragraph 3.1.2. has been revised to replace references to the
Automatic Meteorological System with AMOS. Paragraph 3.1.3. has been revised to include that
Airfield Services personnel will employ a Basic Weather Watch when visibility is 3 miles or
less, ensuring accurate reporting of all airfield visibility minimums. 3.2.2.1. Whenever ceiling
and visibility are determined to be increasing above, equal to, or less than, 5,000 feet and 5
miles, respectively, WF personnel will be prepared to augment the automated sensors to ensure
accurate observations are being transmitted. The remark “AO2A” will be added to any
observations which are augmented by a trained forecaster. 3.3.3. PIREPs will be solicited from
aircrews in flight during local flying hours, and all PIREPs received that impact 26 OWS
products will be entered into JET as a part of the eyes-forward process. In addition, PIREPS and
SIGMETS will be incorporated into the MWP creation process. Table 3.1. SPECI criteria for
visibility, ceilings, and RVR have been updated to reflect the most up to date criteria as dictated
by local FLIP guidance and criteria established in this instruction. Section 3.6. has been added to
cover Augmentation (Back-up and Supplementation) of the FMQ-19. 3.6.12. Updated to outline
the supplementation and back-up of sensor data as well as the conditions in which Weather
Flight personnel will be called upon to supplement or back-up the specified data. 4.1. AFW-
WEBS has replaced JAAWIN. 4.2. Daily observations are retained in the Weather Flight for 3
months. Official requests from off-base agencies should be coordinated through 14 FTW Public
Affairs to flight leadership. 4.4.1. The Daily Aircraft and Maintenance (DAM) Meeting will take
place every Wednesday and Friday in the Wing Conference Room. These times are subject to
change based on mission requirements. 4.4. Out-of-Station Briefings, Upon closure of the base
weather station all active briefings (any flight that has not reached its final destination) will be
faxed to the 26th OWS briefing cell to be METWATCH’d. 4.4.6.1.4. Very Important Person
Special Airlift Mission (VIPSAM) and USSTRATCOM (TF-294) missions are supported by the
local weather flights IAW wing procedures. Contract commercial carriers provide for their own
weather support. 4.5. The Mission Execution Forecast Process (MEFP) is now an 8-step process,
and has been revised. 4.5.3. If unforecast weather conditions begin to form either at the airfield
or in CAFB’s area of operations, forecasters will update the MWP and alert the SOF and FTS’s
to these changes. Figure 4.2. has been replaced with an updated listing of RM
MISSIONWATCH Procedures. Table 4.2. TAF Amendment Criteria, has been revised to add
Category E to Ceiling and Visibility Limits and to add Altimeter Setting Amendment Criteria,
IAW AFMAN 15-129V1. Section 4.6. TAF maximum and minimum temperature encoding has
changed. 4.7.3.2. The Mission Weather Product will be available at least an hour and a half prior
to the start of local flying to accommodate formal briefing production. 4.7.4.1. Added: Unlike
the TAF, the local Mission Weather Product is tailored to the specification and amendment
criteria unique to the CAFB mission and is the official forecast for CAFB. 4.7.6.2.4. Has been
revised to define when a weather condition may be considered temporary. Table 4.4. MWP
Amendment Criteria has been updated to be representative of local and AETC ceiling and
visibility requirements. 5.1.6. Added: Gunshy Watches, Warnings and Advisories. 26 OWS

issues these warnings and AFWA issues as the backup for the 26 OWS. 5.3.1. Was added to
define support to be provided to the installation commander to determine or declare a Tropical
Cyclone Condition or Readiness or Hurricane Condition as outlined in CAFB Plan 555,
Hurricane Evacuation Plan. Tables 5.1. and 5.2. were revised to account for the changes in
Watch and Warning criteria. Figure 5.1. changed Base Operations to Airfield Management.
Figure 5.3. changed to show verbal advisory notification to Airfield Management. Table 5.4.
Observed Advisory Information, has been changed to account for the addition of Icing within the
local flying area, as observed by aircraft. 9.2. Airfield Operations was added in Support to and
From the 14th Operations Group; a representative from the Weather Flight will be provided to
attend the Air Operations Board (AOB) meetings quarterly or as needed. 9.3.4. The Control
Tower and/or RAPCON will pass any pertinent weather data gathered from PIREPS to the
Weather Flight within 5 minutes of receipt, IAW duty priorities. 9.5.1.1. Notifications of
Weather Watches, Warnings and Advisories (WWA) will be sent to AM Ops via email from the
JET system. If AM Ops is not receiving these notifications, the duty forecaster will print the
WWA and walk it to the AM Ops counter. 9.5.2.4. “Secondary crash network” was changed to
“secondary crash net”. 10.1.3.1.1. A representative from the Weather Flight will be provided to
Civil Engineering/Emergency Management to coordinate requirements on an annual basis as
well as provide weather data for EM to run their chosen CBRN model and provide weather
products to Emergency Support Functions (ESFs) to fulfill their mission requirements in the
Emergency Operations Center (EOC). CE/EM will provide a representative to provide
requirements to the Weather Flight. 10.3. The Fire Department will be provided with a
representative from the Weather Flight to coordinate requirements on an annual basis. The Fire
Department will also be contacted via LMR radio upon the passage of a tornado or significant
severe weather threat. The Fire Department will also provide a representative to provide
requirements to the Weather Flight. 11. Space Shuttle support was deleted from Chapter 11 as
the Weather Flight no longer provides support for the Space Program. Tables 12.13., 12.17. and
12.21. were changed to account for the changes to wording for wind speed criteria. Table 12.22.
was changed based upon guidance provided by the 14th Medical Group.

                                            Chapter 1

 COLUMBUS WEATHER FLIGHT REQUIREMENTS, FUNCTIONS, AND SYSTEMS

1.1. Purpose. Effective weather support is an integral part of the 14 Flying Training Wing's
(FTW) successful mission completion. The 14th Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight
(OSW) is the focal point for official weather information at Columbus AFB. This instruction
defines the weather flight’s duties, responsibilities, and services; documents weather support
requirements for all customers; illustrates the flow of information; and, serves to document the
support the weather flight requires from other agencies. All services are provided in accordance
with appropriate Air Force instructions and Federal guidance.
1.2. Mission. The mission of 14 OSS/OSW is to deliver timely, mission-focused weather data
in support of the 14 FTW and its primary mission—to produce pilots. For 14 OSS/OSW to
successfully complete its mission, the following assumptions are made.
     1.2.1. Weather communications and equipment are functioning properly.
     1.2.2. Weather support is aimed primarily at the steady-state training mission. Additional
     contingency requirements will be supported based on training, equipment, and personnel
     availability.
1.3. Concept of Operations.
     1.3.1. 14 OSS/OSW is organized under the 14th Operations Support Squadron (OSS), 14th
     Operations Group (OG). 14 OSS/OSW will solicit and tailor customer support requirements,
     and define the dissemination of weather information within this instruction.
     1.3.2. 14 OSS/OSW will accomplish the below-listed tasks.
        1.3.2.1. Train, certify, and re-certify all members of the Weather Flight on all unit duty
        positions, as well as develop, conduct and participate in training that incorporates the 14
        FTW mission and tactics.
        1.3.2.2. Conduct operations consistent with Air Force Instructions and Federal guidance.
        1.3.2.3. Source and develop required weather information and provide services to
        supported units consistent with this instruction and the Mission Execution Forecast
        Process (MEFP).
        1.3.2.4. Perform quality assurance and operationally verify products.
        1.3.2.5. Maintain the capability to deploy to main (and forward area) operating locations,
        as well as maintain deployment-ready personnel to support mobility commitments.
        Weather Flight leadership will identify pre-deployment tasks that need to be
        accomplished by tasked personnel to help ensure mission success in an austere
        environment with limited communication and weather data access, IAW AFMAN 15-
        127, Air Force Weather Qualification Training.
     1.3.3. Supported units will:
        1.3.3.1. Identify changes in required service and the source of this requirement (i.e.,
        instruction number or tech order) to 14 OSS/OSW.
COLUMBUSAFBI15-101 30 OCTOBER 2013                                                           9


      1.3.3.2. Develop checklists detailing actions to be taken upon notification of severe
      weather. Checklists should be coordinated with 14 OSS/OSW and Wing Safety (14
      FTW/SE) within 60 days of the initial Plan publishing, change, or revision. All units
      must develop detailed checklists to support the CAFB Plan 10-2, Comprehensive
      Emergency Management Plan.
      1.3.3.3. Provide a representative empowered to make decisions concerning weather
      support for their organization for participation in annual weather support feedback.
      1.3.3.4. Tasked agencies will provide support in accordance with (IAW) this instruction.
1.4. Operational Constraints.
   1.4.1. Operational Constraints to Mission.
      1.4.1.1. The Weather Flight is not manned for 24-hour operations. Operational hours
      will be determined by mission requirements. The 26th Operational Weather Squadron
      (OWS) continues the meteorological watch (METWATCH) after airfield hours during
      routine operations.
      1.4.1.2. The Weather Flight will have one Mission Services NCO/Airman available
      during local flying hours to support mission requirements, except in a real-world
      evacuation. Weather personnel will not evacuate the Weather Station for exercises while
      the airfield is open. During a real world or exercise station evacuations, weather
      personnel relocate to the RAPCON conference room and continue taking observations
      under basic weather watch guidelines in accordance with AFMAN 15-111, Surface
      Weather Observations, paragraph 2.14.1., and Chapter 3 of this document, only if the
      automated sensors are not operational. The observations can be relayed via telephone
      during evacuation or JET (Joint Environmental Toolkit) outage to the Control Tower
      (x2476) alternate (x1220), SOF (x7639), RAPCON (x2016). The 26 OWS or any
      available Air Force Weather Station can be contacted to transmit the KCBM observation
      to the weather network if access to JET and to the AFW-WEBS (Air Force Weather Web
      Services) are unavailable.

Figure 1.1. RM Evacuation Decision Matrix.
   1.4.2. Access to Information.
      1.4.2.1. Release of weather information to non-DoD personnel must be coordinated
      through Public Affairs (14 FTW/PA). Requesters will be notified if a charge for service
      is expected. Any expense associated with the request must be reimbursed. The Air Force
      will not assume any legal, financial, or moral responsibility for services provided.
      Weather support to the 14 FTW mission takes precedence over support to any outside
      agency.
      1.4.2.2. The 14 OSS/OSW is not staffed to provide non-operational weather information,
      except on a case-by-case basis. For non-operational purposes, agencies can use a variety
      of sources on the Internet. To obtain operational weather information via the LAN,
      Columbus AFB units and personnel can use the sources listed in Table 1.1. Using these
      suggested alternative information sources allows weather personnel to concentrate on
      mission forecasting and severe weather

   2.2.2. The Weather Flight Chief will:
       2.2.2.1. Aid the Flight Commander in the execution of weather requirements described
       in this instruction by writing, maintaining and implementing standard operating
       procedures (SOPs) and other documents IAW Air Force directives.
       2.2.2.2. Supervise creation of the flight duty schedule and delivery of mission services
       personnel recall schedule to the 14 FTW Command Post.
       2.2.2.3. Manage quality assessment (QA) and metrics programs to ensure efficient and
       accurate weather products.
2.3. Operating Hours. A Weather Mission Services NCO/Airman will be on duty Monday
through Friday and Sunday, no later than 2 hours prior to airfield opening and first takeoffs, and
will remain on duty until the end of flying. On no-fly Saturdays, Sundays with no cross country
flight returns, federal holidays, and any other days when the airfield is closed, the Weather Flight
will also be closed. The Weather Flight Commander or the Weather Flight Chief may extend
duty hours based on mission requirements.
   2.3.1. Weather Recall. When the Weather Flight is closed, 14 OSS/OSW standby Mission
   Services personnel and the Severe Weather Action Team (SWAT) leader are on standby for
   recall. The 26 OWS will monitor the weather situation and initiate a recall of standby
   personnel through CAFB Command Post IAW the 14 OSS/OSW/26 OWS Data Sheet.
   Standby mission services personnel, when recalled to the Columbus AFB weather station,
   will provide "Eyes Forward" support whenever 26 OWS issues a weather watch and/or
   warning meeting any criterion as listed in Table 2.3. Standby Mission Services personnel
   will call the 26 OWS and CAFB Command Post immediately upon reopening the weather
   station. The Weather Flight will coordinate with the CAFB Command Post to establish
   recall procedures.
COLUMBUSAFBI15-101 30 OCTOBER 2013                                                           13

    Severe Weather that requires activation of the SWAT is marked with an
asterisk.*
**Standby Forecaster will only report for Moderate Thunderstorms if hail is
expected. Similarly, SWAT will only be activated for Moderate Thunderstorms
if the standby forecaster determines that there is a risk for hail.
   2.3.2. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP). The purpose of the SWAP is to ensure
   weather station management (senior, experienced personnel) are notified and respond to both
   potential and/or actual severe weather events within Columbus’s area of responsibility. 14
   OSS/OSW duty Mission Services personnel or standby mission services personnel will recall
   the Columbus AFB Severe Weather Action Team (SWAT) when 26 OWS issues a watch or
   warning for severe weather, but not sooner than 4 hours before the anticipated start of the
   severe weather event. For the purposes of this document, severe weather is defined as the
   occurrence or expected occurrence the criterion listed in Table 2.4. The SWAT Leader is the
   final authority on decisions regarding the time and extent of the SWAT's involvement in
   managing the severe weather event. The SWAT Leader will coordinate the team during the
   severe weather event. The SWAT Leader will keep Wing leadership and 26 OWS informed
   of current and forecast weather conditions, ensure that all weather products are horizontally
   consistent, contact CAFB Command Post to provide timely OPREP-3 information, and
   provide forecasting assistance to the duty mission services personnel as required. Further
   SWAP details are provided in the applicable SOP. Note: Weather Operations operational
   support may be limited to all base/customers due to limited manning and availability.
   Limitations to unit support may include: Weather Operations technicians answer only
   telephone hotlines, shortened/cancelled weather briefings, long telephone hold periods,
   slower update to various MWP products, etc.
       2.3.2.1. Procedures before and during Potential Severe Weather. The standby weather
       forecaster will be available via the SWAP phone at 662-364-2975, and will report ASAP,
       but no more than 30 minutes after being recalled. The weather forecaster who is on duty,
       or who has been recalled to duty by the Command Post, will keep the SWAT Leader
       informed of the potential for severe weather. They will immediately notify the SWAT
       Leader (30-minute recall) whenever the potential for severe weather moves within
       100NM of Columbus AFB and/or is expected to affect the base within 4 hours. The
 14                                          COLUMBUSAFBI15-101 30 OCTOBER 2013


      SWAT Leader and the individual on duty will discuss, analyze and assess the severe
      weather threat in conjunction with the 26 OWS Columbus Forecast Team by reviewing
      pertinent meteorological information. If the SWAT Leader, Weather Technician, and the
      26 OWS determine there is a risk of severe weather, the SWAT Leader may recall
      additional forecasters, as needed.
      2.3.2.2. Post-Event Procedures. Once the SWAT Leader, OWS technician, and the WF
      technician have determined the severe weather threat has passed, the SWAT Leader will
      ensure Weather Operations are returned to “ops normal” (ensure work area is clean,
      answer/return any pending phone calls, report any severe weather damage, see OPREP 3
      Reporting, Chapter 7, paragraph 7.4.) before dismissing the SWAT. Any necessary
      changes to the SWAP will be documented in this instruction and in Weather Operations
      SWAP SOP.

2.4. Location/Contact Information.
   2.4.1. The Weather Flight is located in the Base Operations building (Bldg #847). The
   briefing counter is manned during local flying hours to brief aircrews. Since personnel
   resources are limited, every effort is made to provide useful and accurate flight planning
   information for local, route and military operating area flights via the Mission Weather
COLUMBUSAFBI15-101 30 OCTOBER 2013                                                           15


   Product (MWP). For further information or clarification, weather personnel can be contacted
   at the following numbers.

Organizational Email Address       14oss.osw.users@us.af.mil
   2.4.2. During evacuations, weather personnel will relocate to the RAPCON conference
   room, Bldg 1805. Meteorological watch procedures are resumed to the greatest extent
   possible using the local area network and JET. MISSIONWATCH for MWP’s should
   continue with no interruptions in service.
2.5. Meteorological Equipment. Weather personnel use a variety of meteorological equipment
to observe and forecast weather conditions at Columbus AFB and surrounding areas.
   2.5.1. GR2Analyst and GRLevel3. Radar data is collected and processed at the NEXRAD
   site, located at Greenwood Springs, approximately 18 nautical miles north of Columbus
   AFB. The Air Force owns and maintains the NEXRAD facilities. The National Weather
   Service (NWS) in Jackson, MS controls the radar’s operating modes and chairs radar
   committee meetings. The Weather Flight Radar Coordinator (or alternate) is a non-voting
   member of the radar committee and will attend, at a minimum, semiannual meetings with the
   committee chairman. The 26 OWS is considered a voting member, and will also attend these
   meetings, if able. If unable to attend, the 14 OSS/OSW will represent 26 OWS and will
   coordinate with, and provide the DoD response for technical, scientific, and administrative
   matters brought before the URC. Weather Flight personnel use the GR2Analist and
   GRLevel3 to interrogate thunderstorms for indications of severe weather or tornadoes. Both
   of these programs are also used to verify forecast aircraft icing, low level wind shear, and
   turbulence. The GRLevel products will be upgraded IAW NWS and HHQ directives and will
   remain current with latest software and hardware updates. As a backup to GRLevel products,
   and to give 14 FTW Flying Squadron Supervisors and the Supervisor of Flying access to
   radar data, the 14 OSS/OSW supplies WeatherTAP accounts for access to radar and satellite
   images. Radar imagery is also available on the 26 OWS web page.
      2.5.1.1. Accurate measurements of intensities and echo tops are limited to those within
      124NM of Columbus AFB MS.
      2.5.1.2. Since the NWS controls the antenna, WF personnel must coordinate changes to
      the system settings/scan strategies. This could result in a delay when requesting specific
      products.
   2.5.2. Automatic Meteorological Observing System (AN/FMQ-19): Known as an AMOS,
   this system is positioned on the approach ends of the center runway. There are two systems;
   the primary end (13C) and the discontinuity end (31C). The sensors send the data from these
 16                                           COLUMBUSAFBI15-101 30 OCTOBER 2013


   instruments to a Terminal Data Acquisition Unit (TDAU) located in building 847 that sends
   it to the JET server via the LAN. Any computer on a government domain can display live
   meteorological data, however, a CAC is required. The primary sensors are located 1,234 feet
   down the runway 13C and 512 feet right-of-center of runway. The equipment base is at 188
   feet MSL. The discontinuity sensors are located 1,107 feet down the runway 31C and 507
   feet left-of-center of runway. The equipment base is at 209 feet MSL. There are no known
   operational limitations to the airfield weather sensors. The instrumentation includes:
      2.5.2.1. Primary (Runway 13C): Wind direction, speed, gusts and squalls (on top of a
      30 foot tower mast), temperature, precipitation measuring device, ice accretion monitor,
      precipitation type monitor, visibility (for both the primary and discontinuity location)
      RLIM runway lights and runway heading (used to compute runway visual range [RVR]),
      ceilometers (for both the primary and the discontinuity location which measures cloud
      layers up to approximately 24,000 feet AGL), lightning (measures both cloud-to-ground
      and cloud-to-cloud within 30 miles) , ambient light, humidity (to compute dew-point),
      and pressure (uses 3 measuring devices).
      2.5.2.2. Discontinuity (Runway 31C): Wind direction, speed, gusts and squalls (on top of
      a 30 foot tower mast) visibility, RLIM runway lights and runway heading (used to
      compute RVR).
   2.5.3. Manual Observing Kit: Used during station evacuations when the weather systems
   cannot be reached via the LAN. Contains Kestrel 4500NV (electronic handheld wind,
   temperature/dew point and barometer), and other items necessary to conduct a basic
   meteorological watch. Note: If the weather flight doesn't have access to the fixed airfield
   weather equipment information, the wind values and pressure values will be reported as
   estimated.
      2.5.3.1. The Kestrel 4500NV will be utilized as backup to the AN/FMQ-19 in the event
      that the equipment (on both runways) becomes inoperable. Inactive runway AN/FMQ-19
      equipment will be used, if considered representative, if the active runway weather
      equipment becomes inoperative. Note: If weather conditions warrant the transmission of
      RVR and the active runway RVR equipment is not available, RVRNO will be transmitted
      locally.
2.6. Communications Equipment. The Weather Flight uses the following communications
equipment to relay weather information to the wing and outside agencies.
   2.6.1. JET. The Weather Flight and 26 OWS will use JET to disseminate observations,
   forecasts, watches, warnings and advisories. Computers using JET are considered MISSION
   CRITICAL and will not be turned off during INFOCON exercises.
   2.6.2. GRLevel2Analist/GRLevel3. The GRLevel products communicate with the RDA via
   a dedicated line.
   2.6.3. Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV) Radio. The frequency for the Columbus PMSV is
   354.6. This radio enables weather personnel to provide weather data and receive pilot reports
   (PIREPs) from aircrews. The range of the PMSV is approximately 120 miles in all directions
   (dependent on flight altitude of the aircraft). When outside the Columbus AFB PMSV range,
   aircrews should call the KBHM Guard on Frequency 287.3 and request a phone patch to the
   Columbus AFB WF.
COLUMBUSAFBI15-101 30 OCTOBER 2013                                                           17


     2.6.3.1. For short-term PMSV outages less than 48 hours, the WF will notify the
     Supervisor-of-Flying (SOF) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) of the outage. The WF does
     not have an alternate frequency, nor is there an alternate weather facility within 250
     nautical miles that can monitor the 354.6 PMSV frequency.
     2.6.3.2. For long-term PMSV outages over 48 hours, Airfield Management will be
     notified by weather personnel to annotate outage information on the local Airfield Status
     Board and transmitted via a Notice-to Airman (NOTAM) for aircrews to contact a nearby
     weather facility on a different frequency, or to contact the KBHM Guard on Frequency
     287.3 and request a phone patch to the Columbus AFB telephonically at 662-434-2992.
  2.6.4. Multiple line and hotline telephones. Weather information is transmitted through JET
  and courtesy calls are made via telephone to ensure receipt of information upon issuance of
  weather watches, warnings, and advisories. Aircrews desiring to contact the WF via
  telephone patch should call 1-800-982-4257 (Command Post), and press option 6. Dedicated
  hotlines are connected to the Command Post, Maintenance Operations Center, RAPCON, Air
  Traffic Control Tower operations, flying squadron supervisors (SUPs) and the Supervisor of
  Flying (SOF). Weather mission services personnel are notified of aircraft and ground
  emergencies via the secondary crash net controlled by the Airfield Management desk.
  2.6.5. Local Area Network (LAN) and Internet. Local and Internet computer networks are
  essential to today’s weather mission services personnel. Weather station operations are
  critically hampered by any network outage. Back-up procedures using the Cable One
  modem must ensure that current meteorological data can be obtained, tailored to customer
  needs, and delivered to the customer to use.
     2.6.5.1. Cable Modem. The Weather Flight subscribes to a commercial cable modem
     service as a backup in the event of disruption/failure of the LAN to sustain the ability to
     send and receive critical weather data. The cable modem is only available while we are in
     building 847 and does not apply if relocate/evacuated to our Alternate Operating
     Location (AOL).
  2.6.6. Hand-Held Land Mobile Radio (LMR). This radio provides direct access to the
  Commanders BLAZE Net. In addition, this radio provides weather personnel access to
  airfield SOF, vital information for flight line, and CAFB operations.
  2.6.7. Bearcat Radio Scanner. This scanner provides the weather flight with local and
  pattern radio traffic describing limited flight operations due to weather. In addition, this
  scanner provides capabilities to monitor NWS Severe Weather Broadcasts over alert
  channels.
  2.6.8. Weather equipment will be fixed in accordance with the priorities approved by 14
  FTW/CC.

                           AIRFIELD SERVICES OPERATIONS

3.1. General Information.
   3.1.1. The Weather Flight takes and disseminates the official observation for Columbus
   AFB. Observing services will be provided during airfield operating hours and to provide
   "Eyes Forward" support for the 26 OWS. "Eyes Forward" support is defined as Weather
   Flight personnel relaying all significant, time-sensitive meteorological information to the 26
   OWS.
   3.1.2. The Weather Flight records observations from the AMOS sensors located at the
   approach ends of the center runway complex. The official observing point for augmentation
   (back-up and/or supplementing) of the AMOS is located at the flight line end of the sidewalk
   behind Bldg 847. The field of view from the observing point is unobstructed from the
   Northwest (320 degrees) to the Southeast (140 degrees). The view is obstructed from the
   Southeast to the Northwest due to flight line facilities and trees. There are adequate visibility
   markers from the Northwest to the Southeast up to 2 miles out. There are an inadequate
   number of visibility markers beyond 2 miles. Visibility markers are updated or reviewed for
   accuracy annually.
   3.1.3. Airfield Services personnel will employ a Basic Weather Watch (when not in AUTO
   mode) when visibility is 3 miles or less, ensuring accurate reporting of all airfield visibility
   minimums. Also, Airfield Services personnel will issue Observed Warnings and Advisories,
   as necessary, to inform supported units of hazards.
3.2. Airfield Services Process.
   3.2.1. Shift change discussions provide continuity between shifts. Weather personnel will
   discuss weather trends and equipment outages.
   3.2.2. Weather personnel will evaluate weather conditions as dictated by AFMAN 15-111.
   When weather conditions worsen or improve through criteria that affect customer operations,
   the Weather Flight transmits the information to the customers via JET.
       3.2.2.1. Whenever ceiling and visibility are determined to be increasing above, equal to,
       or less than, 5,000 feet and 5 miles, respectively, WF personnel will be prepared to
       augment the automated sensors to ensure accurate observations are being transmitted.
       The remark “AO2A” will be added to any observations which are augmented by a trained
       forecaster.
   3.2.3. Quality Assessment. Weather personnel review the observations for coding errors and
   the results are integrated into the flight’s quality measurements.
3.3. Observation Products.
   3.3.1. Record observation (METAR). This type of observation is transmitted between 55
   and 59 minutes past each hour.
COLUMBUSAFBI15-101 30 OCTOBER 2013                                                              19


   3.3.2. Special observation (SPECI). Observations made when conditions meet the criteria
   listed in paragraph 3.6. Specials disseminated locally will contain all elements. Single
   element specials may be made for tornadic activity and volcanic eruptions.
   3.3.3. Pilot Reports (PIREPs). Weather observations made by airborne personnel and relayed
   to the Base Weather Station via the PMSV, air traffic control, RAPCON, the SOF, squadron
   supervisors via their squadron common frequencies, or other communications systems.
   PIREPs provide important information on conditions encountered during flight and are
   invaluable aides during local flying hours weather personnel will solicit and disseminate all
   significant and "severe" PIREPs which affect 14 FTW operations. All urgent PIREPs will be
   disseminated immediately first locally, and then longline. All PIREPs received that impact
   26 OWS products will be entered into the JET system as a part of the eyes-forward process.
3.4. Weather Station Evacuations or JET Outage. During a station evacuation, all weather
personnel will relocate to the Alternate Operating Location (AOL) at the RAPCON facility
(conference room), in accordance with paragraph 1.4.1.2., and continue taking observations
under Basic Weather Watch guidelines if the FMQ-19 is not operational or working properly. If
unable to connect to the LAN, weather personnel will relay observations via telephone to Tower,
RAPCON and SOF. In the event of a JET communications problem, weather personnel will
transmit their observation via AFW-WEBS through the Internet. As a last resort, another
weather station will be contacted via telephone and observation verbally relayed for
transmission.
   3.4.1. The Weather Flight will maintain SOPs on an external hard drive, which will be
   located in the bug-out kit and utilized in the event of a COOP which includes evacuation to
   the AOL. Weather Flight personnel will execute a COOP in conjunction with an AOL bug-
   out at least annually IAW 15-129V2.
3.5. Transmission. Weather observations are recorded and sent electronically via JET. JET
records the data on AF Form 3813 for climatological purposes. The AF Form 3813 is then
forwarded to the 14th Weather Squadron (14 WS), at least every 7 days, for archiving.
3.6. Augmentation.
   3.6.1. Summary of Back-up of the AN/FMQ-19. Back-up is manually providing weather
   data and/or disseminating an AN-FMQ-19 generated observation when the primary
   automated method is not operational or unavailable due to individual sensor(s), system or
   communications failure. There is no requirement to back-up the system/sensor when the
   airfield is closed, unless tornadic activity is occurring or forecast to occur, then back-up and
   supplementing will be accomplished, as necessary. Back-up will be accomplished, during
   duty hours when the airfield is open, using procedures as described in AFMAN 15-111,
   Surface Weather Observations,

Table 3.1. , Summary of Mandatory Supplementary Weather Conditions.
   3.6.2. Augmented Single Element Specials. Are authorized for tornadic activity and
   volcanic eruptions when a delay in reporting all elements of the SPECI would cause an
   immediate threat to life or property (i.e., “TORNADO SW MOV NE”) or for timely off-base
   reporting.
 20                                            COLUMBUSAFBI15-101 30 OCTOBER 2013


   3.6.3. Summary of Mandatory Supplementary Weather Conditions. Supplementing is a
   method of manually adding meteorological information to an automated observation that is
   beyond the capabilities of AN/FMQ-19 to detect and/or report. The following are the
   mandatory weather conditions that must be supplemented:
       3.6.3.1. Tornadic Activity (to include Tornado, Funnel Cloud, and Waterspout).
       Weather personnel will supplement the observation anytime this weather phenomena is
       observed to begin (first seen), are in progress, or disappear (end).
       3.6.3.2. Hail is observed (during duty hours when the airfield is open) to begin (and is ¼
       inch or greater in size), is in progress, or ends.

   3.7.7. Wind Shift. The wind direction changes 45 degrees or more in less than 15 minutes
   with sustained winds of 10 knots or more throughout the wind shift. A “gust” is defined as
   the maximum wind speed observed during the 10-minute observational period with a
   variation of 10 knots or more between peaks and lulls.
   3.7.8. Squall. When squalls occur.
   3.7.9. Miscellaneous.
      3.7.9.1. Volcanic Ash. When first observed and until no longer observed. (must be
      supplemented if occurring during duty hours).
      3.7.9.2. Any other meteorological situation which, in the opinion of Weather Flight
      personnel, is critical to the safety of aircraft operations or resource protection.
   3.7.10. Resumption of Services. A SPECI is taken within 15 minutes after mission services
   personnel return to duty following a break in observing coverage at the unit, unless a record
   observation is filed as scheduled during that 15 minute period. Note: This applies only with
   the occurrence of an actual evacuation and the resumption of service from the AOL and
   manually taking the observations. This does not apply if resumption of service is from the
   AOL and the AN/FMQ-19 information is still available and operational.
3.8. AN/FMQ-19. When Weather Flight personnel suspect an out-of-tolerance or erroneous
wind recording from both sensors of the AN/FMQ-19, take the below listed actions.
   3.8.1. When an AN/FMQ-19 sensor is no longer working properly, the duty forecaster will
   report the outage to the Central Focal Point and perform back-up, inputting the corrected or
   missing element in the METAR/SPECI, until the equipment is operational.
      3.8.1.1. The duty forecaster will maintain situational awareness of local weather
      conditions and the AN/FMQ-19 observations during airfield operating hours. Weather
      technicians will also monitor area observation and forecast products to keep abreast of
      changes expected to affect the CAFB AOR.
   3.8.2. Airfield services personnel will inform air traffic control, including Control Tower,
   SOF, and RAPCON of the following:
      3.8.2.1. The AN/FMQ-19 wind systems are out of service and should not be used.
      3.8.2.2. To use winds from the latest official observation.
      3.8.2.3. Airfield services personnel will measure and report the winds more frequently to
      adequately support local flying operations, as needed.
   3.8.3. Once the actions listed above have been completed, Airfield services personnel will
   inform air traffic control, including Control Tower, SOF and RAPCON of the following:
      3.8.4.1. To continue using the official observation until Weather Flight personnel are
      confident AN/FMQ-19 wind systems are representative, based on comparisons with an
      alternate means.
      3.8.4.2. When the AN/FMQ-19 wind systems are restored to operational status.
3.9. Other Meteorological Situations. Any other meteorological situation which airfield
services personnel feel is significant to local operations.

                            MISSION SERVICES OPERATIONS

4.1. General Information. The 14 OSS/OSW and 26 OWS develop and tailor weather
products in support of the 14 FTW and its mission. Mission Services personnel analyze data
collected from many sources to produce a fine scale forecast for our local area. Data sources
evaluated by the Weather Flight include products from the GRLevel products, Operational
Weather Squadrons, AFW-WEBS, National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.
   4.1.1. Forecasting services not outlined in this instruction shall be coordinated in advance
   with the Flight Commander or Flight Chief to ensure proper manning is in place or available.
   4.1.2. Questions concerning weather anomalies, support, climatology, etc., should be
   directed to the Flight Commander or Flight Chief during normal duty hours.
4.2. Climatology. The WF provides a wide assortment of climatological data. Climatology
requests are usually filled by using station-specific operational climatic data summaries. Unit-
specific requests for actual past weather and tailor-made graphic climatology are available upon
request however, it may require 7 to 10 duty days to acquire the information from the Strategic
Climatic Information Service (14 WS), in Asheville, NC. WF personnel will request specialized
data from the 26 OWS, or AFWA, 14 WS, etc. The 14 WS collects Columbus AFB observations
each day for archiving into national records, which are available to the general public. Copies of
each day's observations are retained in the Weather Flight for 3 months, or as required by Air
Force Instruction. This data may be used to provide specific support upon the request of a
customer. Official requests from off-base agencies should be coordinated through 14 FTW
Public Affairs to flight leadership.
4.3. Deployment. The Weather Flight is tasked to provide personnel for deployment. Primary
and alternate personnel are trained and equipped for deployment according to the guidelines
specified at Columbus AFB and the unit DOC statement.
4.4. Out-of-Station Briefings. The Weather Flight provides briefings for customers at various
locations around base. Some briefings are a regular occurrence and others are arranged to fulfill
needs for special events. If customers require a non-scheduled out-of-station weather brief,
coordination is required with the WF Commander or WF Chief with at least 24 hours advance
notice. Upon closure of the base weather station all active briefings (any flight that has not
reached its final destination) will be faxed to the 26th OWS briefing cell to be METWATCH’d.
The following paragraphs detail the regularly scheduled out-of-station briefings.
   4.4.1. The Daily Aircraft Maintenance (DAM) Meeting will take place every Wednesday
   and Friday in the Wing Conference Room. The times are subject to change based on mission
   requirements. The format and content of the briefing is tailored to the Wing Commander’s
   preferences and the schedule may change on short notice.          Slides will be sent to 14
   OSS/OSOS on briefing days.
   4.4.2. Instrument Refresher Course. A review of weather codes, products, and hazards for
   pilots is briefed in this course on the first Wednesday of each month. The course content is
   requested and coordinated through the WF Commander.
 26                                             COLUMBUSAFBI15-101 30 OCTOBER 2013


   4.4.3. Cross-Country Mass Brief. The Weather Flight will provide out-of-station briefings
   based on available manning at the weather station and, at a minimum, will provide weather
   briefing support at the base weather station. Mass briefings are to be considered
   informational only, and are not to be substituted for weather briefings. The Weather
   Flight requires at least 24 hours notification for cross-country mass briefings and mandates
   that individuals requesting weather briefing support provide the following information 2
   hours prior to their estimated takeoff time to ensure highest quality decision making product
   is provided:
       4.4.3.1. Aircraft type/call sign.
       4.4.3.2. Estimated time of departure.
       4.4.3.3. Flight level (or levels).
       4.4.3.4. Destinations (and alternates, if required).
           4.4.3.4.1. Any enroute stops, low levels, visual routes, etc.
       4.4.3.5. Arrival times.
       4.4.3.6. Name of the person requesting the briefing.
Note: Only a rated aviator/pilot may receive the briefing if given verbally. If the weather
briefing is received at the weather station; an IP must be present during the brief.

Note: All weather briefings will be faxed to the 26 OWS Flight Weather Briefing cell after the
Weather Flight closes at 318-529-2609 DSN: 331-2609 by 1700L. This is to ensure reach-back
support is available to departing crews via the 26 OWS when the Weather Flight is closed.
   4.4.4. Deployment Concept Brief. The Weather Flight provides forecasts for staging bases
   and climatology for final destinations in support of contingency operations or exercises upon
   request.
   4.4.5. Crisis Action Team (CAT). The CAT recall is either Commander’s Senior Staff only
   or Full-Member CAT, and there is also a small contingent of Stand-by Agencies. The
   Weather Flight is a stand-by member of the CAT. The Weather Flight representative reports
   to the CAT only when requested to attend. The Weather Flight Briefer briefs current weather
   conditions, a forecast for Columbus AFB, and coordinates any other special weather support
   or weather data, such as hurricane forecasts, to the wing leadership.
   4.4.6. Coordinated Weather Operations. Coordinated weather operations ensure all
   technicians, war-fighters, and decision-makers receive the weather information they need at
   the right time. It also ensures a coherent set of weather data is used at all command levels.
   The WF Commander, or his designated representative, will act as the Lead Weather Unit
   (LWU) point of contact for the WF to coordinate on how to provide weather services to
   missions involving more than one unit or service and when Columbus flying customers
   operate away from home base.
       4.4.6.1. Aircrew and weather personnel should use the guidance provided below to
       determine the primary weather information provider for those missions that are not multi-
       unit tasked. Aircrew and weather personnel should use Table 4.1 to determine the
       primary weather information provider of the multi-unit portion of a particular mission.
COLUMBUSAFBI15-101 30 OCTOBER 2013                                                         27


         4.4.6.1.1. Columbus Crews Departing Home Station. These are crews assigned to
         the 14 FTW. The Columbus AFB WF is the LWU and provides all mission weather
         services.
         4.4.6.1.2. Columbus Crews Not Departing Home Station. While off-station (in-
         transit), Columbus aircrews should contact the Operation Weather Squadron (OWS)
         assigned with geographic responsibility covering the departure location IAW Flight
         Information Handbook Part C. An OWS desires a two-hour notice prior to briefing
         delivery.
         4.4.6.1.3. Non-Columbus Crews Departing Columbus AFB (Transient). These crews
         (USAF, USA, USN, USMC, USCG, Guard, Reserve, Civil, and International) will
         utilize the WF assets, duty priorities permitting. In the event the WF cannot provide
         required services, the 26 OWS should be contacted for flight weather services. The
         26 OWS desires a two-hour notice prior to briefing delivery. The Columbus WF will
         maintain a set of service instructions near the computers in the Flight Planning room
         of building 847.
         4.4.6.1.4. AMC Flight Managed Sorties. All Integrated Flight Management sorties
         receive flight weather information from the 618 AOC (TACC). Flight managed
         aircrew should work through their assigned flight manager to resolve weather
         issues/concerns. A team of experienced forecasters work directly with flight
         managers in the TACC AOC. Columbus WF updates takeoff weather and provides
         access to weather products upon request. All CORONET tanker support missions are
         under 618 AOC (TACC). Note: Details regarding mission limiting weather must be
         worked in-concert with the TACC (DSN 779-0308). Very Important Person Special
         Airlift Mission (VIPSAM) and USSTRATCOM (TF-294) missions are supported by
         the local weather flights IAW wing procedures. Contract commercial carriers provide
         for their own weather support.
         4.4.6.1.5. Air Refueling (AR) Sorties. The Missions Weather unit servicing the lead
         receiving aircraft unit is the LWU for, and provider of, the AR portion of a mission
         forecast. In some cases, such as ANG and AFR units, an OWS is the assigned
         weather unit. In other cases, command and control (C2) mission visibility is limited
         and the receiver’s weather unit cannot be readily determined. In these cases and
         others similar, the Columbus WF should ensure that departing Columbus crews have
         the information they need to complete AR missions.

Transient             or arrange for weather support).
Special Operations    Lead weather unit depends on nature of the operation. (Note: When
                      Special Operations Forces operate solely in their own channels, the
                      Special Operations Forces WF or 23 WS will be the lead weather unit).
4.5. Forecast Process.
   4.5.1. Shift Change and Meteorological Discussion. This discussion provides continuity
   between shifts. Mission services personnel relate their assessment of forecast products and
   thoughts on the current forecast as well as brief how they have used the 8-step MEFP to
   create the MWP. Airfield services personnel relay to mission services personnel the current
   weather situation and trends. Finally, the status of the weather equipment is briefed.
   4.5.2. Mission Execution Forecast Process (MEFP). This program is designed to lead
   mission services personnel through a logical thought process to generate the CAFB Mission
   Weather Product. It encompasses weather regime discussions, climatology, supported units’
   sensitivities, missions of the day, and utilizes the MWP Worksheet to organize data
   interpretation.
   4.5.3. METEOROLOGICAL WATCH (METWATCH)/Mission-Scale Meteorological
   Watch (MISSION WATCH). Mission Services personnel monitor weather conditions at the
   base, in flying training areas, and at other locations to ensure weather conditions are
   occurring as expected. If unforecast weather conditions begin to form either at the airfield or
   in CAFB’s area of operations, forecasters will update the MWP and alert the SOF and FTS’s
   to these changes. Mission Services personnel METWATCH for situational awareness and
   update the MWP, at a minimum of every two hours, or as weather impacts dictate, and issue
   Watches, Warnings and Advisories, as necessary, to inform supported units of hazards.
   When the airfield is open and during times of expected severe weather, 14 OSS/OSW
   personnel are on duty to provide “eyes forward” support to 26 OWS forecasters. Otherwise,
   26 OWS forecasters conduct a remote METWATCH, issue and disseminate all Watches and
   Warnings, and initiate a recall of 14 OSS/OSW personnel as necessary.

   1) Determine the mission(s) placed at risk due to terrestrial or space weather conditions.
   2) Continuously monitor at risk mission routes, areas, installation, etc., for significant
      changes. Spot-check low risk missions.
   3) Focus on mission-limiting weather thresholds for each specific mission.
   4) Evaluate for change in risk category and reprioritize MISSIONWATCH as appropriate.
      Notify operational users of weather conditions crossing mission-limiting thresholds.
   5) Integrate weather impacts into operational alternatives decision process.
   6) Update MWPs as necessary.
   7) Continue to monitor missions based on MISSIONWATCH threat.
   4.5.4. Operational Verification and Quality Assessment. Forecasts are verified against
   ceiling and visibility criteria. Additionally, products are evaluated for coding errors. These
   results are integrated into the flight’s quality assessment measurements.
   4.5.5. Flight Weather Briefings. See Paragraph 4.7.2., this chapter.
   4.5.6. Mission Planning. Mission services personnel work one-on-one with aircrews to
   help determine the best places to fly missions; the Mission Weather Product, as well as a
   five-day planning weather forecast, are available on the weather web pages.
   4.5.7. Weather Watches, Warnings, and Advisories. Covered in detail in Chapter 5 of this
   instruction.
4.6. Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs).
   4.6.1. Aviation forecasts in TAF code provide meteorological information for flight planning
   and command and control activities for a specific aerodrome complex. The TAF is not
   tailored to the aircraft and mission limitations of Columbus AFB. The TAF is written in
   METAR code to conform to worldwide standards. This forecast is valid for a 5 statute mile

   radius around the center of the airfield; published every 8 hours when the airfield is open,
   with each forecast valid for 30 hours. The Columbus AFB TAF is issued by 26 OWS and is
   disseminated through the JET. If 26 OWS is unable to operate for a period of less than 72
   hours, 14 OSS/OSW mission services personnel will assume 24-hour METWATCH and
   TAF responsibilities for Columbus AFB.

                                Categories are determined by the lower of the values.

                                Notes:
                                1. Forecast category is determined by the lower ceiling or visibility
                                value.
                                2. Use surface visibility to determine forecast category.
                                3. Substitute the lowest published airfield minimum for
                                Ceiling/Visibility category A.
                                4. During periods of rapidly changing ceilings or visibilities crossing
                                multiple categories, consider conditions occurring for the greatest

* Specification Criteria        1,500 ft ceilings: Local threshold based on fuel requirements
Surface Winds:                  Wind Speed: The difference between the predominant wind speed and
                                the forecast wind speed is > 10 knots and/or the difference between the
                                observed gusts is > 10 knots from the forecast gust. For example, a
                                forecast of 23018G25KT must be amended if observed predominant
                                wind speed is 28 knots or more, or if the observed gusts are 35 knots
                                or higher. Similarly, amend the TAF if predominate winds are 8 knots
                                or less, or gusts are 15 knots or less.

                                Wind Direction: Direction change > 30 degrees when the predominant

4.7. Mission Weather Product (MWP).
   4.7.1. The MWP is prepared daily when flight training is conducted at Columbus AFB. The
   MWP is not prepared when the airfield is opened for special flights or when regular training
   is not scheduled. The MWP is designed to replace local weather briefing support and
   provide the FTS’s with all the essential information needed to conduct local flying operations
   to include out and back flights within the WF’s hazard chart area. Additionally, the MWP
   will assist instructors and students in planning for their various missions as well as provide
   the SOF and SUPs forecasts vital to conducting safe training. The MWP is made available
   via the base LAN on the Weather Flight’s web page, and on the 26 OWS web page. In the
   event of a LAN outage, the MWP will be distributed via fax to the SOF and flying
   squadrons. If there is a telephone and LAN communications outage, the weather flight will
   send a runner to the flying squadrons if manning permits. If there are any questions about the
   MWP, contact the mission services personnel for clarification. Attachment 2 of this
   document illustrates a normal working copy of the MWP.
      4.7.1.1. In the event the WF cannot provide a MWP to CAFB flying training squadrons
      due to manning levels or temporary duty commitments, WF leadership will coordinate
      requests for briefing support with the 26 OWS. A Support Assistance Request (SAR)
      will be filed to accommodate any data requests which cannot be fulfilled by the WF.
   4.7.2. Policy on MWP Use for Local and Cross Country Flights. Crews will use the MWP
   and locally produced hazard charts located on the WF web page for all local flying
   operations at CAFB to include out and backs. In the event the airfield and WF are not open,
   crews will use the 26 OWS’s Flight Briefing Cell, which will be pre-coordinated by the WF.
   Crews will receive cross-country weather briefings for all cross-country missions, regardless
   of distance, and any out and back flights beyond the MWP hazard chart coverage. If locally
   produced hazard charts are not available, those produced by 26 OWS may be substituted.
   The MWP will be used by all flying squadrons for local training, MOA operations, and out-
   and-back flights within the WF’s hazard chart area, unless otherwise coordinated to be
   provided by the OWS. Student pilots are prohibited from being the sole receiver of a weather
   brief.
      4.7.2.1. Local training missions are defined as any training flight that begins and ends at
      Columbus AFB (KCBM) or Golden Triangle Airport (KGTR) during the same training
      sortie.
      4.7.2.2. If the training flight is considered a cross-country flight (i.e., a flight that does
      not return to KCBM/KGTR on the same day, regardless of distance from KCBM/KGTR),
      a weather briefing is both appropriate and required. This briefing may be written, or it
      may be given verbally when VFR conditions with no weather hazards exist along the
      entire route, according to the discretion of the requesting pilot.
      4.7.2.3. An electronic MWP is also maintained at the WF for phone-in and face-to-face
      verbal updates. An Instructor Pilot (IP) will receive a weather briefing if any portion of
      an out-and-back flight is outside the MWP hazard chart coverage, as student pilots may
      not be the sole receiver of a briefing.
   4.7.3. The MWP will be produced and updated according to the following guidelines:
      4.7.3.1. At a minimum, one MWP will be prepared per flying training day.

      4.7.3.2. The Mission Weather Product will be available at least an hour and a half prior
      to the start of local flying to accommodate formal briefing production.
      4.7.3.3. The MWP will be updated every two hours, or as weather impacts dictate as
      described in Table 4.3. of this instruction, and throughout the day to provide the most
      timely and accurate product to our customers.

Figure 4.3. RM MWP Procedures.
   4.7.4. The MWP is divided into two sections: MWP and HAZARDS. Existing sections may
   be removed/altered, or additional sections added, to enhance or improve mission support.
      4.7.4.1. MWP Section. This section contains the 14 OSS/OSW generated Mission
      Weather Product, Watches, Warnings and Advisories, solar/lunar data, forecast surface
      temperatures, pattern and climb winds, Space Weather Impact, Hazards snapshots, AR
      Track forecasts, MOA forecasts, IR, VR, and SR Routes forecasts, 175-1 Request ability
      and feedback ability. Unlike the TAF, the local Mission Weather Product is tailored to
      the specification and amendment criteria unique to the CAFB mission and is the official
      forecast for CAFB. Route and track forecasts provide cloud coverage (FEW, SCT, BKN)

                WEATHER WATCHES, WARNINGS, AND ADVISORIES

5.1. General Information. 26 OWS and 14 OSS/OSW personnel generate and relay all official
hazardous weather bulletins for Columbus AFB. Customer requirements and Air Force
instructions drive the criteria for these notices. Customers execute actions outlined in their
response checklist to prepare for, survive, and recover from severe weather events. Once issued,
a weather notice is valid until it is canceled or the specified valid period expires. The types of
weather notices are as follows:
   5.1.1. Weather Watch. A special notice to supported agencies alerting them of the potential
   for weather conditions of intensity to pose a hazard to life or property. Watches apply to an
   area within 5 NM from the center of the airfield.
   5.1.2. Weather Warning. A special notice to supported agencies giving them advance
   notification of weather conditions of such intensity to pose a hazard to property or life for
   which the agencies must take protective action. Warnings apply to an area within 5 NM of
   the center of the airfield.
   5.1.3. Observed Weather Warning. A special notice to supported agencies giving them
   notification that weather conditions of intensity to pose a hazard to property or life are
   occurring within 5 NM from the center of the airfield.
   5.1.4. Forecast Weather Advisory (FWA). A special notice to supported agencies giving
   them advance notification (with sufficient time to allow protective actions to be taken) of
   mission limiting, non-severe conditions are expected to directly affect our local training areas
   and/or an area within 5 NM from the center of the airfield.
   5.1.5. Observed Weather Advisory. A special notice provided to supported agencies which
   notify them of non-severe weather conditions that could affect their operations are occurring
   within 25 NM (observed lighting strikes only) and within 5 NM from the center of the
   airfield.
   5.1.6. Gunshy Watches, Warnings and Advisories. 26 OWS issues these warnings and
   AFWA issues as the backup for the 26 OWS.
5.2. Gunshy PROCEDURES.
   5.2.1. 14 OSS/OSW is responsible for the METWATCH for Columbus AFB and supported
   agencies. 14 OSS/OSW will also MISSIONWATCH Gunshy Auxiliary Airfield, and Golden
   Triangle Regional (KGTR) Airport ONLY when Air Force assets are located at KGTR.
   When mission-impacting conditions are forming or imminent, forecasters will notify the SOF
   immediately.
   5.2.2. The 26 OWS directly contacts Gunshy with the WWAs, and affected agencies are
   notified so personnel can take protective actions.
5.3. Hurricane and Tropical Storm Advisories. All hurricane and tropical storm advisories
are relayed to predetermined agencies when the current or forecast position of the storm center is
within 200 NM and hurricane or tropical storm conditions are expected to occur at Columbus
AFB. Advisories from the National Hurricane Center depicting storm track and intensities are
COLUMBUSAFBI15-101 30 OCTOBER 2013                                                             39


relayed verbatim. Mission Services personnel will not modify or deviate from them in any way.
Also, Mission Services personnel will follow the Tropical Cyclone Threat Assessment Product
(TC–TAP) produced by the OWS for all derived wind values, which will be relayed verbatim.
   5.3.1. The weather flight commander, or designated representative, will provide the
   necessary forecast services/products required for Wing leadership to determine or declare a
   Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness or Hurricane Condition as outlined in CAFB Plan
   555, Hurricane Evacuation Plan.

5.5. Weather Watch/Warning/Advisory Dissemination. Figure 5.1. illustrates the normal
flow of weather notifications. During periods of communication outages or situations where
adverse weather develops too rapidly for notification through the normal system, 14 OSS/OSW
broadcasts the condition and estimated timing over the commander’s net. The broadcast will
emphasize that it is a communication out notification. When time and capability permit, 14
OSS/OSW will resume normal notification procedures. Cancellation and termination of weather
notifications utilize the same information dissemination system.
5.6. Watch and Warning Criteria. Watch specification criteria deviation from 15-129V1 has
been coordinated and documented with OWS in WF-OWS Installation Data Sheet. See criteria
in Tables 5.1. and 5.2.

   5.7.2. The Command Post utilizes the AtHOC notification system to give situational
   awareness to wing personnel when severe weather threatens Columbus AFB. This
   notification consists of an electronic banner that acts as a pop-up on all computers logged
   into the base LAN. Additionally, personnel are encouraged to input their personal phone
   numbers into AtHoc. This will allow WWAs to be transmitted via phone to personnel who
   are not at their computers. The AtHOC system is a supplement to WF telephonic and JET
   notifications and is not the official notification system for weather Warnings, Watches, and
   Advisories.
   5.7.3. After normal duty hours. When local flying terminates, 14 OSS/OSW is not available
   to provide observations of weather phenomenon, including lightning observations. Figure
   5.2 below illustrates the dissemination of watches and warnings during the times when 14
   OSS/OSW is closed.

                              SPACE WEATHER SUPPORT

6.1. General Information. Space environmental conditions affecting the mission at Columbus
AFB will become more apparent as older training aircraft are modernized or replaced by more
sophisticated systems. Today, the most significant impact is interference with ultra-high
frequency (UHF) communications. A UHF link to Air Force Weather Agency Space Weather
products is provided on all 14 OSS Weather Web Pages and MWP for the communications
personnel to use during times of UHF radio outages. This link will provide the customer with a
graphic product that will show space weather impacts for the local Columbus, MS area.
6.2. Space Products Support. The MWP has three color coded links to the 26 OWS web site
that provide GPS, UHF and HF space weather support to the base. The link backgrounds will be
green when no impact is expected, yellow for impacts expected. Also, the weather flight will be
notified via phone from AFWA of any severe solar impacts that are expected to occur and the
weather flight will contact the Communications Squadron on base to update them on possible
space weather impacts.

                             SEVERE WEATHER READINESS

7.1. General Information. AFI 10-229, Responding to Severe Weather Events, has outlined
actions that will be taken to prepare for, and recover from severe weather. The Wing
Commander will chair meetings as required, but not less than annually, to review installation
severe weather preparedness, capabilities, requirements, and procedures. These meetings will be
attended by representatives of base agencies responsible for developing protective action plans,
WF, guard and reserve components, tenant organizations, local off-base units, and other
organizations with severe weather notification requirements (e.g. Safety, CE Readiness and
Emergency Management). Other attendees will include agencies responsible for information
dissemination (e.g. Communications Squadron and Command Post). Meetings will address, at a
minimum, the following:
   7.1.1. Severe weather observing and forecasting capabilities and corresponding user
   requirements to identify the weather phenomena for which notification is required to include
   the threshold values and desired lead-times.
   7.1.2. Adequacy of dissemination procedures, both primary and backup.
   7.1.3. Adequacy of protective action procedures and resources.
   7.1.4. Adequacy of severe weather awareness training and exercise procedures.
7.2. Information Dissemination. The Installation Commander will ensure that WFs are
required to telephonically contact as few agencies as possible to relay severe weather
information. The use of a pyramid-type reporting system should be employed whenever possible
and maximum use of technology is encouraged (i.e., use of local notification systems, email) to
facilitate the relay of information.
7.3. Exercises. Exercises, tailored to upcoming seasonal severe weather concerns, will be
conducted semi-annually. This semi-annual exercise will be conducted with the 26 OWS as well
as base EET personnel. The purpose of this exercise is to evaluate the timeliness of notification
of personnel and response capability to severe weather events for both on- and off-base agencies
to ensure validity of plans to respond to severe weather. These exercises may be integrated with
base Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan exercises. Real world severe weather events
meet this requirement if properly evaluated and documented, to include lessons learned.
7.4. OPREP-3 Reporting. The WF will submit OPREP-3 reports to the 14 FTW/CP in
accordance with AFI10-229; AFI10-206, Operational Reporting and Unit Operating Procedures.
   7.4.1. When the following significant weather occurs and results in damage.
       7.4.1.1. Winds 50 knots or greater (to include gusts).
       7.4.1.2. Hail ¾ inch or larger.
       7.4.1.3. Tornadoes.
       7.4.1.4. Lightning strikes.
       7.4.1.5. Snow Storms.

13.2. T-38/T-38C (43rd/49th/50th FTS) Weather Thresholds. Operating thresholds for T-38/T-
38C aircraft are listed below. Note: the T-38/T-38Cs are very sensitive to upper flight level
temperature forecasts during Functional Check Flights. The temperature determines the
minimum allowable mach speed for these flights. A two degree error may cause compressor
stall or flameout. The upper level temperature forecast is also used to determine the minimum
allowable mach speed for supersonic flights. This table is not available electronically, but may
be found in T-38/T-38C T.O.s.

Terms
Basic Weather Watch (BWW)—The method of taking surface weather observations, wherein
the official point for weather observations on the airfield is co-located with the forecasting
function in the Base Weather Station and airfield services personnel are required to perform
duties in addition to observing weather.
Ceiling—The lowest layer aloft reported as broken or overcast or the vertical visibility into an
indefinite ceiling. If the sky is totally obscured, the vertical visibility will be the ceiling.
COLUMBUSAFBI15-101 30 OCTOBER 2013                                                             73


Weather Flight (WF)—An umbrella term covering any military weather organization tailoring
operational and strategic level weather products and providing decision-quality environmental
information for an operational user's military decision-making processes.
Cooperative Weather Watch—A method of assisting airfield services personnel in performing
basic weather watch, wherein air traffic control personnel, as priorities permit, notify airfield
services personnel of significant differences from the reported conditions.
Gusts—Maximum wind speed observed during the 10-minute observational period indicated by
rapid fluctuations in wind speed with a variation of 10 knots or more between peaks and lulls.
Meteorological Watch (METWATCH)—A deliberate process for monitoring terrestrial
weather or the space environment in an area or region. The purpose of a METWATCH is to
identify when and where observed conditions significantly diverge from forecast conditions and
determining courses of action to update or amend a forecast product or group of products and
notify designated agencies. A Terminal METWATCH is conducted for a specific aerodrome.
This type of METWATCH is normally carried out by a Combat Weather Team that is located at
that terminal and is providing direct observing and (or) forecasting services, such as Advisories,
Watches, and Warnings.
MISSIONWATCH—A deliberate process for monitoring terrestrial weather or the space
environment for specific mission-limiting environmental factors. The MISSIONWATCH
process identifies and alerts decision-makers to changes affecting mission success. The different
types of MISSION WATCH include the following.
a. Area MISSION WATCH—Conducted for flying areas, auxiliary fields, and alternate fields.
b. Flight MISSION WATCH—Conducted for specific flights. For example: A specific “out-
and-back” flight or a VIP flight.
c. Terminal METWATCH—Conducted for a specific terminal, normally by a Combat Weather
Team that is located at that terminal and is providing direct observing and (or) forecasting
services, such as advisories, watches, and warnings.
d. Route MISSION WATCH—Conducted for the specific routes of missions.
Pilot Report (PIREP)—A report from an aircrew member of weather conditions experienced
during flight.
Pilot-To-Metro-Service (PMSV)—A method to provide weather support directly to aircrews
requesting service over the prescribed radio frequency.
Thunderstorm—A local storm produced by a cumulonimbus cloud that is accompanied by
lighting and/or thunder.
