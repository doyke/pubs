                                            PREFACE

This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and
training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements and training support
resources for the pavements and construction equipment operation specialty. The CFETP will
provide our people with a clear career path to success and instill rigor in all aspects of our career
field training.
Note: Civilian occupying associated positions may use Part II as a guide to support duty position
qualification training.
The CFETP consists of two parts used by the supervisor to plan, manage, and control training
within the career field.
Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.
   •   Section A provides general information about how the CFETP will be used.
   •   Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities,
       training strategies, and the career field path.
   •   Section C associates each skill-level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education,
       and training).
   •   Section D indicates resource contraints.
   •   Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt.
Part II includes the following:
   •   Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) to include duties, tasks, and
       technical references to support Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted
       training, wartime course, and correspondence course requirements.
   •   Section B contains the course objective list and training standards supervisors will use to
       determine if an Airman has satisfied training requirements.
   •   Section C identifies available support materials.
   •   Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources
       available to support training. Included here are both mandatory and optional courses, and
       exportable courseware.
   •   Section E identifies MAJCOM-unique training requirements supervisors can use to
       determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs.
   •   Section F identifies home station training references and courses material required for
       this specialty in support of contingency/wartime training.
Note: At unit level, supervisors and trainers must use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training
commensurate with the overall goals of this guide.
Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective
and efficient training at the appropriate point in their careers. This plan will enable us to train
today’s work force for tomorrow’s jobs. At the unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part
II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this guide.

duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training. The following decisions
were made by a career field STRT held at Fort Leonard Wood, MO on the 30th of April through
the 4the of May 2012.

B3.1. Initials Skills Training. The initial skill course was reviewed for content. Additions,
deletions, and modifications were made to the course. Wartime training tasks were identified
and validated.

B3.2. Five Level Upgrade Training Requirements. Existing CDCs were reviewed and
updated to ensure only current material remained and new technology information was added.

B3.3. Seven Level Upgrade Training Requirements. Seven-level training requirements were
reviewed and validated.

progression in the AFS.

B4. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) Academic Programs. Airmen are
automatically enrolled in CCAF upon completion of basic military training. CCAF provides the
opportunity to obtain an Associates in Applied Sciences Degree. In addition to its degree
program, CCAF offers the following:

B4.1. CCAF Instructor Certification (CIC) Program. The CIC is a professional credential
that recognizes the instructor's extensive faculty development training, education and
qualification required to teach a CCAF course, and formally acknowledges the instructor's
practical teaching experience. Qualified instructors who teach CCAF collegiate-level credit
awarding courses at a CCAF affiliated school. Qualified officer, enlisted, civilian and other
service instructors are eligible for this certification. Once an instructor leaves CCAF instructor
duty, they are no longer eligible for the CIC and the three-levels of this program consisting of
CIC-I/II/III.                Complete            details      can         be        found       at
https://augateway.maxwell.af.mil/ccaf/certifications/cic/.

B4.2. The Professional Manager Certification (PMC). This professional credential is
awarded by CCAF and formally recognizes an individual’s advanced level of education and
experience in leadership and management, as well as professional accomplishments. The PMC
is primarily designed for Air Force SNCO’s. However, any enlisted Airmen who meet all
program requirements may be nominated and awarded the PMC. Once an individual retires,
separates or is commissioned, they are no longer eligible for the PMC. Complete details can be
found at https://augateway.maxwell.af.mil/ccaf/certifications/pmc/.

B6.1. CE Occupational Badge. The Civil Engineer badge reflects a great history and tradition.
By wearing it, you will be recognized by your fellow airmen as having achieved an expected
level of competence. The multitude of engineers before you established this expectation through
excellent service in both peace and war. Eligibility criteria for award and wear of AF
occupational badges can be found in AFI 36-2923 Aeronautical, Duty, and Occupational
Badges.

B6.2. CE Badge Heraldry. The gear wheel and compass have historically been used to
represent the engineering profession, in both the military and civilian sector. The gear represents
the essence of engineering: applying scientific principles and technology to practical ends. To
Air Force engineers, the gear symbolizes an element (representing the built environment) that
meshes with other environments (weapon systems and trained personnel) to enable the Air Force
to perform its mission. The compass is a precision tool historically used by engineers in
designing and constructing facilities and equipment. The gear and compass together symbolize
all the diverse specialties within Air Force civil engineer. Finally, the wings help to portray the
fundamental linkage between the engineering and aviation components; and that the built
environment is the foundation supporting Air Force mission and people.

B6.2.1. Basic Badge. The basic badge is awarded
upon successful completion of the apprentice
course.




B6.2.2. Senior Badge. The senior badge adds a star to the top
of the badge. Wear the senior badge after award of the 7-
skill level.




B6.2.3. Master Badge. The master badge adds a
wreath around the star. The Master Badge is
awarded to master sergeant or above with 5 years
in the specialty from award of the 7-skill level.

                                             PART II

                    SECTION A - SPECIALTY TRAINING STANDARD

A1. Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC Army
ITRO Pavements and Equipment Apprentice and Air Force Unique Training courses with class
beginning 17 September 2013 and graduating on or after 1 January 2014.

A2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS, Air Force Training Program, and in
collaboration with the Civil Engineer, Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), it is
mandatory for all civil engineers, regardless of duty assignment, to use an automated training
record. The automated training record currently being utilized to document upgrade and
qualification training is an application located on the CE-VLC.

A2.1. Column 1 (Tasks, Knowledge, and Technical References). Lists the most common tasks,
knowledge, and supporting technical references (TR) necessary for Airmen to perform duties in
the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level.

A2.2. Column 2 (Core Tasks). Identifies core tasks (specialty-wide training requirements) by an
asterisk (*) in the appropriate skill level sub-column. As a minimum, trainees must complete
hands-on certification on all core, critical and diamond tasks for skill level upgrade.

A2.2.1. Wartime Tasks. All tasks in the 3-level course column are considered wartime tasks.
In response to a wartime scenario, these tasks will be taught in the 3-level course in a streamlined
training environment.

A2.2.2. Diamond Tasks. Tasks identified by a diamond (♦) are considered contingency/war
task and are critical to the career field. Equipment shortfalls at most locations have created
problems with actual hands-on certification of these tasks. In instances where required
equipment is not available for instruction, completion of the corresponding task AFQTP is all
that is required for upgrade/qualification training.

A2.3. Column 3 (Certification for OJT). Used to record completion of tasks and knowledge
training requirements. Use the automated training record application to document individual
qualifications. Task certification of core, critical and diamond tasks require a training
completion date and initials of the trainee, trainer, and certifier. All non-core tasks require
training completion date and initials of the trainee and trainer only.

A2.4. Column 4 (Proficiency Codes Used to Indicate Training/Information Provided).
Indicates formal training and correspondence course requirements. It shows the proficiency to
be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task, knowledge and the
career knowledge provided by formal courses, web-based training (WBT) and AFQTPs. See
CADRE/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the unit education and training manager for current
CDC listings.

A2.5. Qualitative Requirements. Contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level
of training and knowledge provided by WBT, resident training and career development courses.

A2.6. Job Qualification Standard (JQS). The STS becomes the JQS for OJT when placed in
automated training application and used according to AFI 36-2201. For OJT, the tasks in
Column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no go level. “Go” means the individual can perform
the task without assistance and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use
of procedures. AFQTPs, when available, shall be used to identify Air Force standardized
procedures. When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:

A2.6.1. Documentation. Document and certify completion of training.

A2.6.1.1. Duty position. Duty position requirements will be developed and identified by the
workcenter supervisor and loaded into the automated training application. Completion of core,
critical and diamond tasks are mandatory for all duty positions. Ensure the correct duty position
title is listed under Profile 1 section of the trainee’s automated training record.

A2.6.1.2. AFQTP Training and Documentation. AFQTP or AFQTP assessments have been
created for all core (*) and diamond (♦) tasks. Completion is mandatory to fulfill task
knowledge requirements for upgrade/qualification training. Each AFQTP provides step-by-step
procedures for the trainee, trainer, and certifier in completing each core or diamond task and
instructions how to document the training in the automated training record.

A2.6.1.2.1. Training. Documentation of the start and completion of the AFQTP in the QTP
section located in the automated training record is required for all core and diamond tasks. The
automated training record will not allow you to sign off any tasks in the JQS until the completion
date has been entered. Diamond tasks require the completion of the web-based course (with the
review and post-test located in the program) or completion of the AFQTP assessment located on
the CE-VLC to determine if the trainee has attained the knowledge level required. Once the
trainee has completed the web-based course or AFQTP assessment, the course completion
certificate must be provided to the trainer/supervisor for documentation of the completion in the
automated training record and completion of hands-on training, if the equipment is available.

A2.6.1.2.2. Hands-On Training. DO NOT sign off the tasks in the JQS until the trainee has
completed hands-on/certification training. For diamond tasks, if the equipment is not available
at home station, the completion of the AFQTP or AFQTP assessment is the ONLY requirement
for upgrade. When the equipment becomes available either at home station or at a TDY location,
the trainee can be signed off within the JQS section of the automated training record.

A2.6.2. Transcribing from previous versions to the new CFETP. Most items should
transcribe automatically during the update of the new CFETP. The UTM and supervisor must
conduct a review of the new STS to identify any new core, diamond, or non-core tasks and add
those tasks to their duty positions.

                                                                 CFETP 3E2X1, 1 September 2013



A2.6.2.1. Previous training certification not listed If previous training certification is not
listed in the individual record, select the parent task to be transcribed, check the task title(s)
block, and click on the transcribe button. Enter the date of the original certification and sign off
the task(s). The trainee will then sign off the task(s) to finalize the transcription of previous
training certification. The automated application will place an entry into the trainee 623a and
must be acknowledged by the transcriber and trainee.

A2.6.2.2. Transcribing external training certification. If a trainee attended a formal training
course and received appropriate accreditation, select the 623 III section of the user automated
training record and locate the course title in the master task list, then enter the completion date.
If the course title is not listed, contact the UTM to have it loaded from the master catalog. If it is
not listed in the master catalog contact the Force Development Manager at AFCEC to have it
loaded in the master catalog.

A2.6.3. Documenting Career Knowledge. When a CDC is not available, the supervisor
identifies STS training references that the trainee requires for career knowledge IAW AFI 36-
2201, Air Force Training Program and ensures, as a minimum, that trainees cover all mandatory
items specified in AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted). For two-
time CDC exam failures, the unit commander will take appropriate action IAW AFI 36-2201.
Note: Career knowledge must be documented prior to submitting a CDC waiver.

A2.6.4. Decertification. When an Airman is found to be unqualified on a task, the supervisor
shall identify the task in the JQS and check the box next to the task title. The supervisor shall
select the Decertify button on the screen menu and enter a 623a comment explaining why the
task was decertified, and then enter the Airman into qualification training. The individual is
recertified using the normal certification process.

A2.6.5. Recertification. When an Airman is required to be recertified on a previous task due to
annual or bi-annual requirements. The supervisor shall identify the task in the JQS and check the
box next to the task title and select the Recertify button on the screen and entry the dates the
recertification was completed.

A2.6.6. Training Standard. Tasks are trained and certified to the “go” level. Go means the
individual can perform the task without assistance and meets the local requirements for accuracy,
timeliness, and correct use of procedures. This equates to a 3c in the proficiency code key.
AFQTPs, when available, shall be used to identify Air Force standardized procedures.

A2.7. Specialty Training Standard. The STS is a guide for development of promotion tests
used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests are
developed at the USAF Airman Advancement Division by senior NCOs with extensive practical
experience in their career fields. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged
by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.
Questions are based upon study references listed in the Enlisted Promotions References and
Requirements Catalog. Individual responsibilities are in AFI 36-2605, AF Military Testing
System. WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Reserve Forces.

Explanations
* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of
knowledge for a specific task. (Example: b and 1b)

** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related
to any specific task, or for a subject common to several tasks.

− This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or
  CDC.

X - This mark is used alone in the course columns to show that training is required but not given due to
limitations in resources.

Note 1: BLK #4: Columns (1) & (2) can be relabeled to meet CF Requirements; i.e., 2 phase 3-skill level course,
5 level QTP

Note 2: Some items located in column 4 of the STS are not taught as part of this course. The supporting
knowledge/tasks and the associated behaviors found in the Army ITRO course will meet the needs of training for
Air Force personnel. These STS items will not include a proficiency code on this document but will be trained in
the resident J9AQA3E231 00RB. Pavements and Equipment initial ITRO course taught by the Army at Fort
Leonard Wood MO to a level that meets the requirements of the Air Force. Note 2 is referenced as N2 in the
STS in place of a proficiency code.

Note 3: All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during wartime.

the-job-training program for upgrade to the 5- or 7-level.

A6.2. These AFQTPs ensures all aspects of the task is covered sufficiently and provide
additional task knowledge in preparation for hands-on training. AFQTPs summarize procedures
on a task performance checklist for use by trainers, certifiers, and trainees.

A6.2.1. The UTM or supervisor can download AFQTP's from the AFCEC – Air Force Civil
Engineer Center Force Development (COF) portal page.

A6.2.2. In additional to the paper-based AFQTPs there are web-based courses or assessments
developed for certain tasks that are available on the CE-VLC under the specialty topic area.

A6.3. Documentation. Before a core or diamond task can be signed off in the JQS section of
the individual automated training record the task must be signed off in the QTP section first.

A6.3.1. Core/Diamond Tasks. To document the completion the supervisor or trainer opens the
individual automated training record, navigates to the QTP section, enter the start, and completed
date with signatures.

A6.3.2. Diamond (♦) Tasks. Supervisors/Trainers DO NOT sign off the corresponding JQS
task until the trainee has completed hands-on training. If the required equipment is not available
at your location, completion of the task’s AFQTP web-based course or assessment with a passing
score of 80% is all that required for upgrade training. Hands-on certification shall be
accomplished at the first opportunity when equipment is available and then can be signed off on
the JQS.

                     SECTION B - COURSE OBJECTIVE LIST (COL)

B1. Measurement. Measurement of each objective is indicated as follows:

B1.1. Written Test (W) indicates task or subject knowledge that is measured using a written test.

B.1.2. Performance Test (P) indicates required task performance that is measured with a
performance progress check.

B1.3. Progress Check (PC) indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and performance
elements using a written test and a performance progress check.

B2. Standard. The standard is 70% on written examinations. Standards for performance
measurement are indicated in the objectives and delineated on the individual progress checklist.
Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check or performance test, and
students may be required to repeat all or parts of the behavior until satisfactory performance is
attained.

B3. Proficiency Level. Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level, which
means the student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of
the task (partially proficient). The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing
the task.

B4. Course Objective List. These objectives are listed in the sequence taught by Blocks of
Instruction. A detailed listing of the initial skills course objectives may be obtained by written
request to 364 TRS/DO, 727 Missile Road, Sheppard AFB TX 76311-2254.

                        SECTION F - HOME STATION TRAINING

F1. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to identify the tasks, training references, and
training sources available in support of contingency/wartime training. Civil Engineer forces will
train to meet the full range of tasks expected in the contingency environment. Training ranges
from knowledge-type training conducted in a classroom, to task-oriented hands-on training
conducted in the field. These training requirements, frequencies, and sources are listed in AFI
10-209, RED HORSE Program and AFI 10-210, Prime Base Emergency Engineer Force (BEEF)
Program.

F2. Home Station Training (HST). HST is knowledge-based and hands-on training that is
conducted at the individual’s home station for contingency operations. The CE Commander
ensures training is provided and documented and arranges for subject matter experts to conduct
training as required.

F3. Combat Skills Training (CST). CST must be institutionalized as an integral part of any
HST program. Lessons learned from operations such as IRAQI FREEDOM have taught us the
importance of maintaining a higher level of combat readiness. Although the inclusion of combat
skills-focused training into HST does not fully prepare CE personnel to work in a high threat
combat environment, the steps taken to enhance training will help elevate units to a readiness
level capable of supporting safe and effective operations in low to medium risk combat
environments.

F4. Mission Essential Equipment Training (MEETS). Wartime or contingency environments
often involve the use of specialized and unique mission-essential equipment that civil engineers
do not use in their day-to-day operations. Due to the cost and complexity, mission essential
contingency equipment and trainer expertise are not commonly found at CONUS installations.
Personnel must be hands-on certified and the certification documented in their CFETP. AFI 10-
210, Attachment 4, identifies minimum number of personnel to be trained, positions by specialty,
frequencies and locations of training sites. Inadequate training on these key equipment items can
negatively impact Air Force contingency operations.

F5. AF Expeditionary (ES) Training Requirement. AETC, as lead MAJCOM for AF ES
training, revamped ancillary home-station and advanced (mission specific) expeditionary skills
training plans to standardize and synchronize training across the force. The AF ES training is
described as Tier 2 and Tier 3 training below:

F5.1. Tier 2: deployment-ready expeditionary skills training. ES for all Airmen delivered at the
wing level in alignment with assigned AEF band. Completion of this training is a requirement to
maintain mission-ready status to produce a deployment-ready Airman, up to and including a
major combat operation. Tier 2 is designed to ensure every Airman maintains ES proficiency
and sustains readiness currency for deployment. Tier 2 curriculum is centrally maintained, but
executed at the local level to afford commanders maximum flexibility. Tier 2 is divided into two
categories; 2A: ES proficiency training (mostly CBT), and 2B: home-station pre-deployment
training.

F5.2. Tier 3: advanced ES training (mission specific). Enhanced ES for selected Airmen as
determined by factors including deployment location, threat assessment, specific mission, duty
assignment, role, operation, or special requirement. Tier 3 training provides mission specific ES
for the individual Airman and/or team and includes courses designed in response to organic Air
Force need or combatant commander-directed theater-specific requirements. Airmen will attend
Tier 3 training such as combat Airmen skills training (CAST) when identified through the force
generation process and directed in appropriate line remarks/reporting instructions.

F6. Training References.

F6.1. AFI 10-210, Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (BEEF) Program, Chapter 4 and
Attachments 2-5 identifies the Prime BEEF recurring training requirements.

F6.2. Web-based Products. Web-based products are available on the CE Virtual Learning Center
(VLC) website at https://AFCESA.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp. Personnel completing these
courses can receive credit for HST. CBT products can be used in a classroom setting to train as
many personnel as possible. Attendance must be documented on a sign-in roster. The sign-in
roster must be maintained IAW AFI 10-210.
