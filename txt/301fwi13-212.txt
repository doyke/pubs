                                           Chapter 1
                         RESPONSIBILITIES AND SCHEDULING
1.1. General. The contents of this chapter are governed by paragraph 2.5.14 of AFI 13-212 and
provide supplemental information for the conduct of operations on Falcon Range. The
Commander, 301st Operations Group (301OG) (DSN 739-6910) is responsible for operational
control of Falcon Range. The 301st Operations Group Commander (301 OG/CC) monitors
range flying and ground support operations to ensure effectiveness and safety. All personnel will
comply with this chapter when operating aircraft or performing ground duties within the confines
of Falcon Range. The range lies within R-5601, and is part of the Fort Sill range complex in
southwest Oklahoma. The US Army Fires Center of Excellence maintains control and
scheduling of the ground space and is the scheduling and controlling agency for the R-5601 air
space. (Figure 1.1)
Figure 1.1 Falcon Range Local Area




1.1.1. The Range Operating Authority (ROA) is the 301st Operations Support Flight (OSF)
Commander. The ROA is responsible for the funding and long-range planning of the range, in
addition to the duties prescribed in AFI 13-212, Chapter 2.
   1.1.2. The Range Operations Officer (ROO) is responsible for the safe and successful
   completion of missions flown on Falcon Range and the supervision of management, planning
   and maintenance. The ROO has authority over all ground operations and support functions
   on the range. The ROO will be a fully-qualified Range Control Officer.

   1.1.3. The Range Control Officer (RCO) is directly responsible for the conduct of air-to-
   surface operations and is primarily responsible for all range operations and air/ground safety
   during range operations.
6                                                         301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013



1.2. Scheduling. The range scheduler is responsible for determining range availability and
submitting requests through the Range Facility Management Support System (RFMSS) at Fort
Sill. The ROO, or RCO in the absence of the ROO, resolves conflicts in range utilization with
all users.
    1.2.1. Units will schedule range periods and request changes through Falcon Range (DSN
    639-6300 / FAX DSN 639-7421). An alternate phone number is (580) 442-2043 / DSN 639-
    2043. Range scheduling requests should be submitted by the 15th of the month (or first work
    day after the 15th if weekends or holidays preclude accepting requests on the 15th) for the
    following month’s flying schedule (e.g. March 15th for April schedule). Requests for night
    or weekend flying activities must be scheduled at least two weeks in advance to ensure
    airspace and personnel are properly scheduled. Falcon Range can accept short notice
    requests, subject to range availability. Requests received after the 15th of the month will be
    scheduled if range time is still available at the requested time. Late arrivals and/or
    cancellations must be coordinated with Falcon Range as soon as possible. Priority (in order)
    shall be given to real-world contingency (AEF) training (deploying within 120 days), higher
    headquarters-directed exercises (such as ORIs), the host unit (301st FW/457th FS),
    secondary users as defined by the Inter-Service Support Agreement, and finally to casual
    users. Requests of equal priority will be considered in order of receipt. The scheduler and
    ROO will resolve time conflicts in a fair and equitable manner based on priorities. The
    scheduler will then provide a copy of the monthly schedule to all users.
    1.2.2. Special events, such as expending heavyweight inert ordnance or utilizing laser
    operations, require coordination prior to range time. Users will contact Falcon Range as soon
    as possible with these and other special requests.
    1.2.3. Users will relay the planned lineup and events to Falcon Range through either
    telephone (DSN 639-6300 or -2043/Comm (580) 442-6300 or -2043) or FAX (DSN 639-
    7421/Comm (580) 442-7421) in order to facilitate efficient handling of the range events.
    This should be accomplished at least one hour before arrival, if feasible. Information should
    include, but is not limited to, call sign, number and type of aircraft, pilot numbers (if
    applicable), weapons delivery events, and targets.
    1.2.4. Falcon Range mailing address is:
    Falcon Range
    P.O. Box 620
    Cache, OK 73527
    1.2.5. Cancellations and scheduling efficiency. Units canceling their range time will do so
    as soon as they find out about the cancellation. This allows other users the range time if
    needed, the ARTCC to release the airspace if required, and allows maintenance on the range.
       1.2.5.1. Users will accurately forecast and schedule their needs. For example, units
       should not schedule 90-minute range periods while intending to only utilize the last 10
       minutes as a matter of scheduling convenience.
1.3. Maintenance. Range maintenance documentation is maintained at Falcon Range. The
ROA is responsible for obtaining support from outside sources for projects beyond the capability
301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                      7

of the Falcon Range detachment. Falcon Range scheduling will notify users of expected closures
at least 30 days in advance, if feasible.
1.4. Decontamination/Disposal. The ROA is responsible for scheduling range residue removal.
The range contractor is responsible for the execution of the de-militarization, removal, and
disposal of range residue.
1.5. Reports. The weapons scoring systems generate hard-copy score sheets. The completed
forms will be forwarded to the appropriate unit using the agreed media, usually via fax.
   1.5.1. Falcon Range personnel will compile and submit the Range Resources Utilization
   Data Reports monthly to the ROA, which will forward this data through channels to HQ
   AFRC/A3V.
1.6. Command and Control. Command and control is exercised through Fort Sill. The RCO
receives control of the range and R-5601C/D/E/F from Fort Sill Range Control (DSN 639-2994
or -2008) prior to the first range period. The RCO returns control to Fort Sill during periods of
administrative downtime and at the end of the day.
1.7. Support Agreements. Copies of support agreements are kept on file at the 301st OG.
Additionally, the DOL Directorate at Fort Sill is responsible for the initiation and coordination of
support agreements with tenant users.
1.8. Firefighting. Fires will be serviced by the Fort Sill Fire Department in accordance with the
current support agreement. RCOs will report all fires to Fort Sill Range Control at DSN 639-
2994/-2008. Only the Fort Sill Fire Chief can determine if a fire is minor or not. When
practical, a Falcon Range RCO or contract employee will accompany the Fire Department down-
range for orientation and safety.
   1.8.1. Fort Sill Range Control will provide the specific pyrotechnic restriction status daily or
   more often if conditions change. Range Control may require a cessation of operations due to
   increased fire danger. This may be a result of high winds, dry weather conditions, over-
   tasked Fort Sill or local firefighting equipment, or warnings issued by the National Weather
   Service. In the event of such conditions, the Fort Sill Fire Chief will issue a series of alerts
   through Range Control. The standard Fort Sill pyrotechnic restrictions are Green, Amber,
   Red, and Black.
       1.8.1.1. Green: All ammunition cleared for use may be expended.
       1.8.1.2. Amber: Partial restrictions apply; all ordnance must remain within the impact
       area.
       1.8.1.3. Red: No pyrotechnics may be used. This is often referred to as a “RED PYRO”
       alert. No white phosphorous, illumination, smoke, or tracer ammunition may be
       employed. EOD detonations are prohibited. No visual threat simulators such as AAA
       pyrotechnics will be fired. Only cold-charge training munitions, training munitions with
       the spotting charge removed in accordance with T.O. 11A3-3-7, inert weapons or TP
       ammunition may be expended. Dry attacks may still be conducted, and there are no
       restrictions on the use of lasers. Countermeasure flares may only be employed above
       1000’ AGL / 2500’ MSL (or higher if required to ensure burnout before ground impact).
       1.8.1.4. Black: No releases of any sort. The combination of humidity, available fuel,
       and winds raises an extreme danger of range fires, and a spark from a metal-on-metal or

      metal-on-rock hit may cause an out-of-control range fire. Dry attacks may still be
      conducted, and there are no restrictions on the use of lasers. Countermeasure flares may
      only be employed above 1000’ AGL / 2500’ MSL (or higher if required to ensure
      burnout before ground impact).

                      RANGE DESCRIPTION AND INFORMATION
2.1. General. Falcon Range is a Class A (manned) conventional and tactics range approved for
both day and night weapons delivery. The range is located on the Fort Sill Military Reservation
at N34° 39.4’ W98° 42.6’, SPS (CH 74) 343°/041 NM. The range impact area lies entirely
within the Fort Sill Quanah Range Impact Area (QRA). The mean target area elevation is 1400
feet MSL. Normal hours of operation are 0730-1800 CST/CDT Monday-Friday. Operations
outside these periods require prior coordination. Refer to paragraph 1.2 for details.
   2.1.1. Range Layout. Falcon Range is a single range consisting of a conventional bomb
   circle, tactical target arrays, laser targets, and multiple mobile tactical targets. Infrared (IR)
   targets are available with prior coordination and approval. Ground and airborne laser
   designator use is approved. See Attachment 4, Falcon Range Target Layout Diagram. The
   Target Area is defined by the Fort Sill Quanah Range Dud Area. The Hazard Area is defined
   by the Fort Sill Quanah Range Impact Area.
2.2. Weather. Falcon Range possesses weather observation and reporting equipment. This
provides immediate weather reporting capability to include ceiling and visibility, type of
obscuration, lightning data, surface winds, and precipitation. It does not report upper level
winds. Falcon Range cannot provide official forecasts and/or observations but can relay existing
conditions and out-the-window observations. Pilots should contact their official weather facility
for relevant nearby forecast information.
2.3. Scoring. Bomb impacts are optically plotted and scored by computer using the Weapons
Impact Scoring Set (WISS). When the computer system is not working or uninstalled, bomb
impacts are mechanically plotted by optical triangulation and scored by computer. WISS allows
digital and tape playback for verification and replots, and a score for each weapon during
multiple releases, if the impact is within the camera field of view. WISS also allows video
recordings for viewing later. Aircrews who want to have a visual record of their deliveries can
coordinate with the RCO for a video backup, and it can be made in the desired format, if
feasible.
   2.3.1. Accuracy. Nominal scoring accuracy is 1.5 meters. Bombs plotted three meters or
   less (computed deliveries) or five meters or less (manual deliveries) are scored as a “bull” or
   “shack”. Scoring accuracy decreases as a function of target distance from the main and flank
   towers. The targets on range are either point or area. Most targets are of the point variety,
   but some, such as T-3SE, T-5NW, T-7C, some of the T-9 targets, and T-17 are area targets.
   Linear targets such as aircraft will have similar scoring, but on a smaller scale. Hits are
   based on the center of the target, so a hit on a building or bridge may visually be a direct hit
   but still score as a close miss (7 meters, for example).
   2.3.2. RCOs transmit scores using distance/clock position (“7 [meters] at 2 [o’clock]”) based
   on the briefed attack heading. Inform the RCO if the attack heading varies from the standard
   080° run-in; weapons scores will be adjusted.
   2.3.3. Each scorable target can be scored day or night. Night missions require hot charges
   (e.g. Mk-4) since scoring requires a visible flash within the camera field of view. Cold
   charges or inert weapons will not be visible at night. Coordinate desired targets with the
   RCO prior to complex missions or deliveries to prevent confusion. Certain wind or visibility
10                                                          301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013

     conditions may limit the effectiveness of the scoring system due to target obscuration.
     Additionally, wet conditions in the target area may preclude accurate daytime scoring of inert
     munitions and “duster” training rounds.
     2.3.4. WISS can score only one target area/complex at a time. Multiple Desired Points of
     Impact (DPIs) require coordination for manual scoring backup. Some targets allow the use
     of one camera system for multiple target arrays. This gives flight leads flexibility when
     planning attacks on separate DPIs. Suitable target pairs are T-3 and T-4, T-5 and T-18, T-6
     and T-17, and T-14 and T-15.
2.4. Target Arrays. The conventional target is T-1. Target arrays T-2 through T-25 are tactical
targets located throughout the range complex. Refer to Attachments 4 through 9 for target area
details, run-in headings, authorized ordnance, etc.
     2.4.1. Target Array 1 (T-1), Conventional Bomb Circle. The bomb circle is an outlined
     graded circle of 91 meters (300 feet) radius. It has two concentric circles of white tires at 23
     meters (75 feet) and 45 meters (150 feet) radius. The center of the circle has a clearly
     identifiable target for aiming reference (usually a small POL tank, but also may be a salvaged
     vehicle, commo box, or stack of tires.) The target is painted to contrast with the surrounding
     area. The DPI is the center of the aiming reference. Additionally, there are three white aim
     points (highly visible markers) located 12 o’clock from the target on a 080º bearing at 1000,
     1500, and 2000 feet. These are used only for aim-off distance reference.
     2.4.2. Tactical Target Arrays: Several target sites are available for tactics training,
     employing sub-scale or inert munitions or for TGP attacks. Several of these targets are not
     visible from the control towers, resulting in the inability to provide attack results and/or
     weapons deliveries scores. When identified, dimensions are east-west by north-south.
     Target descriptions in this instruction may change due to target change-out as a result of
     damage, or due to target area upgrades. Changes will be made available on the range web
     pages as range NOTAMs.
        2.4.2.1. Target Array 2 (T-2), North Ramp. The North Ramp is a graded east-west
        rectangle approximately 100 x 85 meters. This target array has ten major DPIs in a
        circular configuration. T-2W and T-2NW are two 8-inch howitzers. T-2N and T-2NE
        are buildings oriented east-west. T-2E1 and T-2E2 are vehicles. T-2S is a rocket
        launcher and T-2SE is a radar/communications van. T-2C is a small shack in the center
        of the array with a number of barrels immediately adjacent, and T-2SW is a mortar pit on
        the southwest corner of the array. Several full-sized mannequins and personnel
        simulators complete the array. This target array is suitable for inert heavyweight
        deliveries. Care must be exercised so as not to drop on the LTA 500 meters north. Refer
        to Attachment 5, Target Array Details, for details.

301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                 11

     service vehicle (T-4S) is located 25 meters south of the POL tanks. Pilots need to specify
     whether they are attacking the west or east DPI of the POL. Refer to the run-in
     restrictions for this target.
     2.4.2.4. Target Array 5 (T-5), West Ramp. The West Ramp array resembles a dispersed,
     revetted alert aircraft parking and munitions holding area. The approximate dimensions
     of this target are 120 x 100 meters. This ramp has five individual DPIs, consisting of two
     alert aircraft (T-5E and T-5W), a fuel truck (T-5S), plus a munitions storage area (T-
     5NW). An aircraft on the taxiway (T-5NE) completes the array. Refer to the run-in
     restrictions for this target. Refer to Attachment 5 for a detailed target array diagram.
     2.4.2.5. Target Array 6 (T-6), Howitzer Row and POL. This target array consists of nine
     separate DPIs. The western howitzers (T-6W1, T-6W2, and T-6W3) are comprised of
     three self-propelled howitzers at the west end of an east-west graded area of
     approximately 225 x 30 meters. An ammo support site (T-6A) and a small support
     building (T-6B) are located east of the howitzers. The POL site (T-6C) is three POL
     tanks sited vertically in the middle of the array. T-6D is a single howitzer located
     immediately north of T-6C. T-6E is an APC providing security at the east end of the
     array. A single SA-13 target (T-6N) is located 90 meters northeast of T-6C. Refer to
     Attachment 5 for a detailed target array diagram.
     2.4.2.6. Target Array 7 (T-7), Base Operations. The Base Operations array is inside an
     irregular graded area approximately 90 x 90 meters. This target has four individual DPIs,
     consisting of a building 13 meters high constructed of Sea-Land containers (T-7C), a Jeep
     (T-7NW), a base ops/FOLLOW ME truck (T-7NE), and a small helicopter (T-7SE).
     Scoring of T-7C is from the center of the building; it is possible to hit the building and
     still receive a score of 7-10 meters. It is not a point target. Refer to Attachment 5 for a
     detailed target array diagram.
     2.4.2.7. Target Array 8 (T-8), Armored Vehicles. This target array has two individual
     sets of DPIs, consisting of armored vehicle assembly areas. Scoring is not available; T-
     8N and T-8S are scored to Hit or Miss only. The DPI areas are separated by 350 meters
     north-south.
     2.4.2.8. Target Array 9 (T-9), Village. This target array consists of 15 small buildings
     and vehicle targets which represent an insurgent camp or village. The actual DPI must be
     identified for accurate scoring. Some of the buildings are constructed of Sea-Land
     containers and are linear targets. Scoring is from the center of each structure or target.
     Refer to Attachment 5 for a detailed target array diagram.
     2.4.2.9. Target Array 10 (T-10), Helicopter. This single helicopter target and support
     truck is not visible from the range control towers.
     2.4.2.10. Target Array 11 (T-11), Vehicles. This cluster of four vehicles is not visible
     from the range control towers. T-11W consists of two vehicles near a pond. No airborne
     laser designators are authorized on T-11W due to the close proximity of the pond. T-
     11NE consists of a technical truck with a ZPU-4 AAA gun mounted in the bed, and T-
     11SE is a technical truck with a single-shot rocket launcher mounted in the bed and
     oriented to the southwest. Only T-11NE and T-11SE can be scored, and lasers are
     authorized on T-11NE and T-11SE.
12                                                       301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013

     2.4.2.11. Target Array 12 (T-12), Reinforced Bunker. This target is an earthen mound
     with a door and lumber abutments on the west side. This target array is suitable for inert
     heavyweight deliveries. Care must be exercised so as not to drop on the LTA 500 meters
     north.
     2.4.2.12. Target Array 13 (T-13), Runway. The runway on Falcon Range is 7400 feet
     (1.25 NM) long by 120 feet wide. It is oriented 070/250º, and is covered with gravel to
     present the appearance of a real runway. Due to the linear design of this target, scoring is
     not available. The remote moving targets are normally operated on the runway.
     2.4.2.13. Target Array 14 (T-14), Alert Aircraft. This target array is adjacent to the north
     and south side of the runway and replicates two aircraft (T-14N and T-14S) on strip alert.
     A small alert shack, T-14E, is located 10 meters northeast of T-14N. A second shack, T-
     14W, is located 15 meters southwest of T-14S. A maintenance truck is located adjacent
     to the cockpit of T-14S. This target array is located just south of T-15. Scoring is
     available for these targets. Refer to the run-in restrictions for this target.
     2.4.2.14. Target Array 15 (T-15), AAA Site. T-15 is a AAA gun site. It is visually
     modified to present a ZU-23-2 silhouette. This target is located just north of T-14. Refer
     to the run-in restrictions for this target.
     2.4.2.15. Target Array 16 (T-16), Radar Site. Scoring is available for this Fire Can radar
     van (T-16A) and support vehicle (T-16B). The TTR dish for the Fire Can is on the west
     face of the target and points southwest. The DPIs are the centers of the radar van and
     vehicle. Refer to the run-in restrictions for this target.
     2.4.2.16. Target Array 17 (T-17), Bridge. This linear target is constructed from Sea-
     Land containers and is painted gray with a blacktop-simulating black paint on the top of
     the bridge. It is approximately 200 feet in length. DPIs are provided for the north, south,
     and center of the bridge and a single Jeep target located on the top of the bridge. Two
     vehicles are located on each approach to the bridge, and additional targets are located at
     the southern end of the bridge. The targets can be scored. Scoring of the bridge is from
     the portions of the target designated, north, center or south sections; it is possible to hit
     the bridge and still receive a score of 7-10 meters. It is not a point target. The vehicles
     are considered point targets but because of their linear nature a hit may still not score as a
     direct hit. Additionally, because the Jeep is located atop the bridge (7 meters elevation)
     any long bombs may result in significant miss distances. NO STRAFE OR
     HEAVYWEIGHT ORDNANCE IS ALLOWED. Refer to Attachment 5 for a detailed
     target array diagram.
     2.4.2.17. Target Array 18 (T-18), ZSU-23-4. This is a single ZSU-23-4 viz-mod located
     east of T-7. It is at the base of a tree and is camouflaged. Scoring is available for this
     target. No airborne laser designators are authorized on this target due to the close
     proximity of a pond.
     2.4.2.18. Target Array 19 (T-19), Downed Aircraft Target. This target simulates a
     downed counterinsurgency or forward air controller-type aircraft. It is a small aircraft
     located east of the LTA. It is not scored, but is visible from the main and flank tower.

     ORDNANCE IS ALLOWED.
301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                  13

     2.4.2.19. Target Array 20 (T-20), Construction Equipment. This target consists of a
     utility truck, a dump truck, and a backhoe in the process of building a fighting position.
     2.4.2.20. Target Array 21 (T-21), 2 Tactical Vehicles. This target array consists of one
     viz-mod BM-21 rocket launcher truck and one supply truck.
     2.4.2.21. Target Array 22 (T-22), 2 Tactical Vehicles. This target consists of two trucks,
     one dump truck and one utility truck with a AAA piece mounted on the rear. This target
     array follows a small creek and is adjacent to some vegetation.
     2.4.2.22. Target Array 23 (T-23), 2 Tactical Vehicles. This target consists of two trucks,
     with the northern truck adjacent to a north-south embankment, and the southern truck
     within a revetment cut from the embankment. This tactically challenging target array is
     not visible from the range control towers.
     2.4.2.23. Target Array 24 (T-24), 2 Tactical Vehicles. This target consists of two tactical
     vehicles immediately adjacent to the north side of a clump of trees. This target array
     challenges acquisition and identification, and is not visible from the range control towers.
     2.4.2.24. Target Array 25 (T-25), Convoy. This target depicts a tactical convoy
     consisting of several light trucks or technical vehicles. It is oriented north-south, and is
     suitable for High Angle Strafe only.
  2.4.3. Mobile Vehicle(s). These are various mobile vehicles which can be placed at selected
  locations within the Falcon Range airspace, including a working replica of a SCUD missile
  system. These targets are for IR and TGP use only, and will be at the user’s request. The
  location of these targets will be random, unless a user has a specific location based on a
  scenario. The coordinates will be sent to users and will be in a format and accuracy based on
  the user’s scenario. Because these are mobile targets, they may be outside the impact area.
  DO NOT EXPEND ORDNANCE ON THESE TARGETS.
  2.4.4. No-Drop Targets. There are several no-drop targets outside the Quanah Dud Area
  which can be used for dry tactical deliveries. Combat lasers can also be employed against
  these targets, but no actual ordnance of any kind may be employed. These targets include
  trucks, construction equipment, and an actual BRDM. These targets are in a fixed location.
  Refer to the end of Attachment 8 for details.
  2.4.5. Moving Targets. In order to accommodate training objectives, the range can provide
  various moving targets in and out of the impact area.
     2.4.5.1. Unmanned moving targets. The range possesses several unmanned vehicles
     which can be used for attacks with both lasers and training munitions. Generally these
     use HMMWV or SUV-type vehicles. A GPS-guided vehicle is laser-only, and can be
     used for combat laser designations only. Additional vehicles are command-guided, using
     a remote driver to operate the vehicle. In order to maintain footprint control and allow
     the vehicle an opportunity to turn around, the runway (T-13) is the target area of choice.
     For munitions employment, pilots can attack a towed target array which consists of a
     target in the shape of a truck towed 150-200 feet behind the tow vehicle. In order to
     preserve the tow vehicle for future use, aircrews must only attack the towed array.
     Contact the range at least two hours prior in order to verify availability. Inert and
     training munitions as well as 20mm and 30mm strafe may be used.
14                                                          301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013

        2.4.5.2. Manned moving targets. Range personnel can operate range vehicles as needed
        to allow for dynamic tasking within scenarios. Additionally, the range can provide
        personnel to maneuver throughout the impact area as part of the scenario. Coordinate
        with the range at least one hour prior to ensure availability and to provide scenario inputs,
        if needed. Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) personnel can act as their own
        scenario inputs with the concurrence of the RCO, but are restricted to gravel roadways
        and the LTA. No JTAC personnel are allowed into kinetic target arrays. Attacks will be
        dry with the flight verifying that no ordnance can be employed prior to commencing any
        attacks. No lasers may be employed at any time unless deemed eye-safe by the 711th
        HPW/RHDO Optical Radiation Safety Office. Minimum altitudes and ranges will be in
        accordance with FAA and service directives.
     2.4.6. Laser Training Area (LTA). This target area consists of a generic village-type target.
     Some buildings within the array are constructed of Sea-Land containers and plywood, while
     others are actual small shack buildings constructed of metal and wood. The area also
     includes various items associated with cultural buildups, including telephone poles, vehicles
     of various sizes and types, and a pair of top-down targets constructed of a large tire with
     high-contrast white gravel, simulating a manhole or hide-site. The scoring system support
     equipment is located in the middle of the LTA, and two 40’ towers which house the laser
     sensors are located within the LTA. THIS TARGET AREA IS FOR LASER TRAINING
     ONLY and is not approved for any weapons deliveries. A number of targets can be scored
     using combat lasers. Refer to Attachment 10 for details.
     2.4.7. Offset Aim Points (Radar Reflectors). Two radar-reflective offset aim points (OAPs)
     are available. These reflectors are optimized for a 080º heading. The north OAP consists of
     2 metal radar reflectors and is located 3091 meters north of T-1. The south OAP is located
     1378 meters southeast of T-1. Refer to Attachment 7 for coordinates.
     2.4.8. Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). There is one IED simulator located inside the
     LTA. This simulator is a steel barrel with a small quantity of coolant in a container for heat
     contrast. Refer to Attachment 8 for coordinates.
2.5. Strafe Targets. Most tactical targets are available for high angle strafe (greater than 15°
dive), employing 20mm, 25mm, and 30mm TP/TPT. Contact the RCO or refer to Attachment 8
and Attachment 9 for details. The low angle strafe targets are located 500 meters WSW of the
bomb circle and consists of two strafe targets oriented north-south mounted between telephone
poles and separated by 40 meters. These targets consist of drag or cargo extraction parachutes;
generally only one will be raised. Low and high angle strafe passes are acoustically scored using
the Improved Remote Strafe Scoring System (IRSSS). The scoring system requires a reset time
after logging bullet impacts. Allow at least 30 seconds between aircraft on the same target or
else the system may not accurately score the impacts. A foul line consisting of two rows of
white-painted barrels with marking poles is oriented north-south and is located 2000 feet west of
the strafe pits. A line of barrels leads into the strafe target area from west-to-east. Additionally,
25 meters south of the two low-angle strafe targets is a single high-angle strafe target that is also
acoustically scored. It consists of a target on a three-foot high mound of soil. Contact the RCO
with the type of ammunition being used. The run-in heading for both low angle strafe and high-
angle strafe on the dedicated strafe targets is 080° ± 10°. See Attachment 5 for diagrams.
301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                      15

   2.5.1. The low-angle strafe targets will be closed if standing water accumulates in the strafe
   beds or if the strafe pits are frozen, as this increases the risk of ricochets and invalidates the
   weapons footprints. The strafe beds will be maintained in accordance with the schedule of
   AFI 13-212 Chapter 7, or as directed by the RCO based on the strafe bed conditions.
   2.5.2. Low-angle strafe fouls are validated with a camera and recorder system. The RCO
   immediately observes the cease-fire ranges for strafe, and records the cease fire range for
   later review.
2.6. Range Real Estate and Airspace Restrictions. Falcon Range is located on the Fort Sill
Military Reservation. The air and ground space is part of the US Army Fires Center at Fort Sill,
which is the scheduling agency. When the airspace has been activated by Fort Sill, the Falcon
Range Control Officer controls only the airspace overlying Falcon Range (R-5601C/D/E and the
western portion of R-5601F adjacent to C/D/E). Do not enter the range without clearance from
the Range Control Officer. Refer to Figure 2.1, Local Airspace.

     2.6.1. Fort Sill Artillery Areas. R-5601A/B (east of the Falcon Range impact area and east
     of highway 115) extends from surface to 40,000 feet. These restricted areas are not part of
     Falcon Range. R-5601B is often referred to as “West Range”. Do not penetrate this airspace
     without clearance from Fort Sill Approach Control, the JTAC (as coordinated prior to the
     range events), or through the Falcon Range RCO. R-5601A/B may be used for overflight in
     order to employ weapons and lasers from the east with prior coordination at least one day
     prior. The airspace may not be available on a short-notice basis. If authorized to operate in
     R-5601A/B it is essential that altitude restrictions be followed precisely when surface fires
     such as artillery and small arms are employed below.
     2.6.2. Falcon Range. R-5601C/D/E and the western portions of R-5601F overlay the Falcon
     Range Complex. See Attachment 3, Restricted Area R-5601C/D/E/F Map, for restricted area
     airspace boundaries.
        2.6.2.1. R-5601C (defined generally as overlying the Falcon Range impact area)
        normally extends from surface to 24,000 feet MSL. Up to 40,000 feet MSL is available
        upon request. Users requiring the higher airspace must contact Falcon Range at least one
        day prior to the scheduled range period for this additional vertical airspace.
        2.6.2.2. R-5601D (north and west of the impact area) extends from 500 feet AGL to
        24,000 feet MSL. Up to 40,000 feet MSL is available with one-day prior coordination.
        Users requiring the higher airspace must contact Falcon Range at least one day prior to
        the scheduled range period for this additional vertical airspace. This area overlies the
        Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge. When practical, the minimum altitude when flying
        over the refuge is 3000 feet AGL / 5500 feet MSL.
        2.6.2.3. R-5601E (south of the impact area) extends from 500 feet AGL to 6000 feet
        MSL. R-5601E lies underneath the Sheppard 1 MOA with a 2000-foot buffer which may
        also be used as a VFR transition corridor.
        2.6.2.4. R-5601F (north and east of the impact area) extends from 500 feet AGL to
        24,000 feet MSL. Up to 40,000 feet MSL is available with one-day prior coordination.
        R-5601F connects the Washita MOA with the R-5601C/D (Falcon Range) and R-
        5601A/B (Fort Sill West Range), allowing increased maneuverability and tactical
        flexibility.
     2.6.3. Sheppard AFB controls two adjacent MOAs:
        2.6.3.1. The Sheppard 1 MOA, located directly south of Falcon Range, extends from
        8000 feet MSL – FL220. Avoid this high-density student training area unless in contact
        with Sheppard Area Monitor (236.825) or if approved for use of Sheppard Areas 8 and 9.
        2.6.3.2. The Washita MOA, located directly north of Falcon Range, extends from 8000
        feet MSL – FL220. Avoid this high-density student training area unless in contact with
        Fort Worth Center (269.375), or unless scheduled and authorized to use it as part of a
        Falcon Range or Fort Sill scenario.
        2.6.3.3. Sheppard Areas 8 and 9 are located in the extreme northwest part of the
        Sheppard 1 MOA. These sub-areas may be used in conjunction with R-5601 when
        Sheppard AFB has activated the MOA. The area is depicted in Attachment 2 and is
        approximately 10 NM northwest/southeast by 20 NM northeast/southwest. This allows
        aircraft to operate within special use airspace during operations at Falcon Range.
301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   17

      2.6.3.3.1. Sheppard Areas 8 and 9 may be requested any time the Sheppard MOA is
      active. Contact the RCO to ensure it is available other times. Allow at least one hour for
      coordination. Sheppard training has priority within the airspace; if Sheppard is using the
      airspace for primary training it may not be available. If the airspace is allocated to allow
      operations with R-5601 then Sheppard AFB aircraft will be prohibited from operating
      within Areas 8 and 9.
      2.6.3.3.2. Use the Falcon Range frequency for operations in Areas 8 and 9.
   2.6.4. The Altus AFB visual and instrument patterns, oriented north/south, are situated east
   of Altus AFB. The Altus TRSA is approximately 10 NM west of the range boundary and
   extends from 3500 feet MSL to 7000 feet MSL. Expect to see a variety of large transport
   aircraft in this pattern.
   2.6.5. The terrain rises sharply to over 2500 feet MSL three miles north of the impact area in
   R-5601D.
   2.6.6. There is a lighted tower with guy wires located two miles south of the range on the
   edge of the restricted area, located at N 3438.400 W 09841.510, and at 1675’ MSL / 330’
   AGL.
   2.6.7. Do not overfly the main tower (70 feet AGL) or flank tower (85 feet AGL). Avoid
   hot attacks with final headings in the direction of manned sites.
   2.6.8. An inactive Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) airfield is immediately adjacent to the
   southwest part of R-5601C and underneath the western part of R-5601E. The site consists of
   a north-south runway 2200 feet in length, and an east west 1500-foot runway. If it is ever
   activated it can be used to launch and recover unmanned aerial vehicles. It will usually be
   closed when Falcon Range is active with fixed-wing aircraft, but circumstances may allow
   the simultaneous operation of RPAs while missions are active. In these cases the RPA will
   remain over or south of US-62 in the R-5601E airspace.
2.7. Noise Abatement Restrictions. Aircrews using IR-105 / VR-104 / VR-1137 will avoid the
town of Cooperton at N3452.0 W9852.0.
   2.7.1. The Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge is located 3NM north of the impact area. Do
   not overfly the refuge below 3000 feet AGL / 5500 feet MSL.
   2.7.2. Do not overfly the Job Corps Center (3NM northwest of the target complex at
   N3442.0 W9844.3) below 3000 feet MSL within 1 mile.
   2.7.3. Do not overfly the towns of lndiahoma or Cache below 3000 feet MSL.
   2.7.4. Do not overfly at low altitude the two small farms 4.2 miles WNW of T-1, one mile
   west of Job Corps Road, at N 34 40.7 W 98 46.4.
2.8. Communications. Falcon Range has UHF, VHF, LMR, and telephonic communications
equipment.
   2.8.1. UHF. Falcon Range primary UHF frequency is 363.7; the secondary UHF frequency
   is 342.3. Additionally, a tertiary backup of 238.8 may be used with prior coordination.
   2.8.2. VHF: Falcon Range has the capability to communicate / control utilizing VHF-AM
   frequency 141.85 (P) or 140.9 (S).
18                                                           301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013

     2.8.3. LMR: Falcon Range utilizes a variety of Land Mobile Radios (LMR) for internal
     communication requirements and to support weapons scoring, moving target, laser
     designation, and visual and electronic threat simulators.
     2.8.4. DSN, commercial, and field communications are available at Falcon Range.
     2.8.5. Frequencies and telephone numbers are listed in Table 2.1,               Falcon Range
     Telephone List and Table 2.2, Falcon Range Frequency Table.
     2.8.6. The flight lead will check in with Falcon Range prior to entering the range airspace.
     The RCO will then approve the flight onto the range or issue holding instructions and
     provide target information, as well as the current altimeter setting. After flight read-back, the
     RCO will relay the winds, weather of significance, and bird activity, as well as any
     restrictions and personnel locations, if applicable.
     2.8.7. The Falcon Range public web site is at http://sill-www.army.mil/falcon/index.html .
     It contains target photos, scheduling contacts, range NOTAMs, and links to other related
     sites, including limited-access sites.

2.9. Night Vision Device (NVD) and Night Operations. Falcon Range has full night
capability. This includes NVD and target marking capability (both IR and visible light).
   2.9.1. Range personnel have a variety of night vision devices (Generation III NVGs) and IR
   pointers. IR Pointers will be employed from the main and flank towers. If aircrews do not
   wish to use this service, they should coordinate it in advance, as it will be provided to all
   night missions.
2.9.1.1. The 301st FW Life Support (301OSF/OSL) function provides service and periodic
maintenance of NVGs used on-range.
   2.9.2. Towers are marked with red obstruction lights for night identification, an infrared
   (covert) letter “M” oriented so as to appear correctly from west-to-east on the EW building
   north of the main tower, and an infrared (covert) letter “F” on top of the flank tower. When
   manned, the towers will also display an infrared strobe light. To preclude NVD washout and
   halo effects the red obstruction lights will be turned off unless the aircrews request otherwise.
   2.9.3. Standard target lighting is depicted in Attachment 6. Nearly any target can be lighted
   at the aircrew’s request with at least two hours’ prior coordination to allow setup. Targets
   can be illuminated with both covert (IR/NVD only) or overt (unaided eye) lighting that is
   radio-controlled from the main tower. However, not all targets have good radio line-of-sight
   from the towers and some are in inaccessible areas. Contact Falcon Range for capabilities.
   2.9.4. Range personnel will ensure cultural lighting around the operations area and the
   maintenance area is reduced or eliminated. This includes turning off outside lights, weather
   station obstruction lights, windsock lighting, and any other lights that may cause distraction.
   The lighting on the weapons residue storage area 450 meters east of the main tower will
   remain on during night operations.
   2.9.5. There is some cultural lighting interference from the sparsely-populated housing areas
   and US Highway 62 to the south, from the city of Lawton to the east, and from the Job Corps
   located adjacent to the northwest corner of the range complex.
20                                                         301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013

2.10. Helicopter Operations. Helicopters may use the lighted helipad located 245 meters/800
feet NW of the main tower. The helipad is a square concrete slab 50'x50' (15m x 15m). The
helipad has standard “H” markings, and is reinforced and stressed to support aircraft up to
40,000 lbs.
     2.10.1. Eight lights provide night identification of the helipad. The lights are normally off,
     and aircrews may request the lights to be turned on with prior coordination. If in contact
     with the RCO, allow approximately five minutes for the lights to be turned on. Similar
     coordination is required for the lights to be turned off. The helipad lights are not NVD-
     compatible.
     2.10.2. A lighted windsock is located 110 meters/360 feet to the southeast of the helipad.
     Windsock lighting requires the same coordination as the helipad edge lighting. The
     windsock is on a photocell and is normally on after dark, except during scheduled night range
     missions, when it is turned off to preclude NVD interference.
2.11. Area Overflight. Do not enter or overfly R-5601C/D/E/F without approval from the
controlling agency. Contact the RCO on 363.7 for entry approval or Fort Sill Approach Control
on 322.4 for clearance to over-fly the restricted airspace.
2.12. Weather Requirements.
     2.12.1. Day weather requirements. Range weather will be at least 1500 feet AGL / 3 NM for
     level deliveries; 2000 feet AGL / 3 NM for climbing and diving deliveries; or 500 feet above
     the highest portion of the pattern to be flown.
     2.12.2. Night weather minimums are 3000 / 5 NM.
     2.12.3. Pilots will discontinue events and advise the RCO whenever weather prevents
     positive range or target identification throughout the pattern. Falcon Range Operations will
     also advise the users at Sheppard AFB and NAS JRB Fort Worth, as well as any other
     scheduled users, when surface winds on Falcon Range exceed 35 knots. Range winds are
     available from Falcon Range on request. Range operations will be suspended any time the
     RCO determines a hazard exists due to excessive winds. The strafe targets may be lowered if
     the winds are excessive in order to prevent wind damage and prolong their use.
2.13. Range Entry, Holding, and Departure.
     2.13.1. Range Entry. Flights may enter Falcon Range under IFR or VFR. If not entering the
     range via the IR/VR route structure, file to the SPS (CH 74) 338º/040NM. Prior telephone
     coordination with the RCO (DSN 639-6300/2043) is encouraged to reduce the number of
     radio transmissions. See Attachment 2, Aeronautical Chart, for information concerning
     Falcon Range environs.
        2.13.1.1. VFR Entry. VFR entries may be made from any direction except east. Squawk
        Mode 3 4000 entering the range. Use caution for the Sheppard 1 and Washita MOAs (at
        or above 8000 feet MSL).
        2.13.1.2. IFR Entry. When approaching the range under IFR, use Altus (257.725),
        Sheppard (269.025), or Fort Sill (322.4) Approach Control services. Contact the RCO
        upon canceling IFR. Squawk Mode 3 4000 entering the range.
301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   21

      2.13.1.3. Military Training Route (MTR) Entry. Flights may enter Falcon Range via any
      of the numerous IR and VR routes that terminate near R-5601. Contact Falcon Range 2-5
      minutes prior to entry. Enter the range from the northwest, west, or southwest for first-
      pass tactical deliveries.
   2.13.2. Holding.
      2.13.2.1. IMC Holding. Hold as directed by the controlling agency.
      2.13.2.2. VMC Holding. There are no designated VFR holding areas. Hold outside
      restricted airspace southwest or northwest of the range. If required, contact Altus
      Approach 257.725 to avoid the Altus AFB Class C airspace. Avoid continuous overflight
      of inhabited areas at low altitude during extended holding.
      2.13.2.3. Altitude separation. The RCO may allow altitude stacks when coordinated
      between flight leads and the tactics or events allow one flight to hold over another.
   2.13.3. Range Departures.
      2.13.3.1. VFR Departure. Remain VMC. Do not exit the range to the east.
      2.13.3.2. North Departures. Climb above 5500 feet MSL, but remain below the Washita
      MOA lower limit of 8000 feet MSL until in contact with Fort Worth Center (269.375).
      2.13.3.3. South Departures. Low altitude: remain below the floor of the Sheppard 1
      MOA (8000 feet MSL). Medium altitude: climb to 14,500 feet MSL and contact
      Sheppard Area Monitor (236.825 or 124.85) prior to departing range airspace. Use
      caution while transiting the Sheppard MOAs / student training areas.
      2.13.3.4. West Departures. Avoid the Altus Class C airspace, contact Altus Approach
      257.725.
      2.13.3.5. IFR Departure. Exit R-5601 VMC if possible. If unable to remain VMC,
      remain within R-5601 until receiving an IFR clearance either from Fort Sill, Sheppard
      AFB or Altus AFB Approach Controls or Fort Worth Center.
      2.13.3.6. The Falcon RCO will coordinate IFR departures with Fort Sill Approach upon
      request.
2.14. Authorized Ordnance.
   2.14.1. Training ordnance (practice sub-scale and full-scale inert heavyweight bombs up to
   2000 lbs; 20/25/30MM TP/TPT) is authorized for both day and night operations.
   2.14.2. Full-scale inert heavyweight ordnance (inert MK-82, 83, 84) operations are approved
   but must be coordinated with the RCO prior to delivery to coordinate and confirm target
   selection. Targets T-2, T-8, T-12 and T-20 through T-24 are the Falcon Range heavyweight
   targets. Final attack heading restrictions are listed in Attachment 9, and are derived from the
   joint WDZ Tool. The restrictions in Attachment 9 are based on most aircraft and deliveries,
   but are not all-inclusive. Aircrews will not be allowed to employ heavyweight inert weapons
   without contacting Falcon Range before their scheduled range time.
   2.14.3. Rockets may be employed on all authorized targets except T-25. White Phosphorous
   (WP) rockets may only be employed against T-1, T-2, T-6, T-8, T-9, T-12 and T-17.
22                                                          301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013

     2.14.4. Aircraft-dispensed self-protection flares may be employed above 1000 feet AGL
     (2400 feet MSL). LUU-2, -4, and -19 illumination flares may be employed above 4500 feet
     AGL (with a 500 foot delay) but extreme caution must be used to ensure the flares land on
     the range. Higher delays will require higher minimum altitudes.
     2.14.5. Training chaff is authorized in accordance with AFI 11-214. Prior coordination with
     Falcon Range is required. No combat chaff may be expended on Falcon Range at any time.
     2.14.6. Live ordnance is not authorized.
2.15. Weapons Danger Zones. Weapons Danger Zones on Falcon Range are plotted for user
aircraft and are maintained by the ROO and in the control tower. The majority of approved
weapons delivery events is depicted in Attachment 9 and shows the most common aircraft and
delivery combinations at Falcon Range. Other events may be performed at the discretion of the
RCO after a weapons danger zone risk analysis has been performed.
     2.15.1. Certain ordnance and delivery parameters combinations may present a risk to areas
     outside the impact area. These munitions may still be employed but require coordination to
     ensure the adjacent training areas are clear of ground personnel. Munitions affected include
     low- and high-drag full-scale inert ordnance employed from low-angle, low-altitude
     parameters, LGTR and GBU deliveries. The events affected are listed in Attachment 9 (see
     notes). Contact Falcon Range to verify approved target/parameter pairings.
        2.15.1.1. Training areas can be cleared in advance through Falcon Range scheduling up
        to 68 days in advance through the RFMSS scheduling program. However, Army ground
        training may still take priority.
        2.15.1.2. If the training areas are occupied by ground personnel and equipment then the
        weapons deliveries may be restricted to specific targets, the parameters may be modified,
        or the events may be prohibited.
        2.15.1.3. There are three surveyed Observation Points (OPs) within the impact area
        which may be used for close air support control. If the risk exceeds authorized values
        approved by AR 385-63 (1:1 million) then the OP must either be vacated for the events,
        or the events are prohibited.
2.16. Minimums/Fouls. Delivery events and parameters, scoring criteria, spacing, fouls, foul
penalties, and restrictions are IAW AFI 11-214 and aircraft-specific operational guidance.
2.17. Range Procedures.
     2.17.1. Radio Procedures. Upon initial radio contact, pass any changes to prior coordinated
     data. If the mission was not coordinated prior to arrival, pass delivery events and desired
     targets.
     2.17.2. Basic (Conventional Box) Pattern. The basic pattern, day or night, is a rectangular
     pattern situated north of the target areas. Use left traffic for an east (080º magnetic) run-in
     and right traffic for a west (260º magnetic) run-in. Refer to Attachment 9, Falcon Range
     Attack Axis Matrix.
     2.17.3. Tactical Delivery Pattern. The final tactical attack heading, day or night, varies with
     the selected target area, delivery parameters, and weapon. Refer to Attachment 9, Falcon
     Range Attack Axis Matrix.
301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                23

     2.17.3.1. Fly the pop-up pattern from the western quadrant only. The final attack
     heading is generally west-to-east, with further restrictions and refinements to run-ins
     based on the ordnance being delivered. Recover with a left turn off-target to north, or if
     to the south to remain within R-5601E.
  2.17.4. High Angle Strafe Pattern. The tactical targets’ HAS final attack heading is
  generally 035°-125° or 215°-305° magnetic and may be flown from a basic or tactical
  pattern. Scored HAS is on a 080° ± 10° heading (Target 3).

                                             Chapter 3
                                  ABNORMAL PROCEDURES
3.1. Armament System Malfunctions/Unintentional Release.
     3.1.1. Aircrews will ensure that their systems are safe any time the aircraft is outside the
     restricted area. Additionally, aircraft will be armed only when consistent with service and
     command directives, regulations or instructions to ensure munitions remain within the impact
     area only.
     3.1.2. Armament Systems Malfunctions. System malfunctions will be handled IAW
     applicable command, aircraft, and unit operating procedures.
        3.1.2.1. Inadvertent Releases (ordnance fired or released without pilot consent). Check
        armament switches safe and do not attempt further release in any mode. Immediately
        report inadvertent releases to the RCO.
        3.1.2.2. Unintentional Releases (ordnance fired or released as a result of pilot error).
        Check armament switches safe and do not attempt further release in any mode until the
        determination is made that the release was unintentional and not inadvertent. The
        decision to continue to allow releases is solely the RCO’s and will not be arbitrated.
        3.1.2.3. Hung Ordnance. Prior to departing the range, safe all armament switches and
        recover IAW applicable command, aircraft, and unit regulations. Avoid populated areas
        while departing the range.
        3.1.2.4. Off-Range Release. Report any release, whether inadvertent or unintentional,
        which results in or is suspected to result in an impact outside the impact area to the RCO.
        Refer to Attachment 3, Restricted Area R-5601 Map, for impact area boundaries. The
        RCO will report the release to Range Control.
3.2. External Stores Jettison. For controlled jettison of external stores, including fuel tanks,
suspension equipment, and practice ordnance, jettison on a 080° magnetic heading at an airspeed
and altitude consistent with safe operation so that impact occurs near the Conventional Bomb
Circle (T-1). Live munitions will not be jettisoned at Falcon Range unless an extreme
emergency exists. Coordinate with the RCO for jettison of live munitions at Fort Sill (R-5601B).
3.3. Emergency/Abnormal Operating Procedures.
     3.3.1. Controlled Bailout. The aircraft should be flown on a 045º heading at 2000’ AGL
     (3500’ MSL) between the flank tower and the west end of the runway. This ensures the
     aircraft crashes on U.S. Government property while minimizing risk to ground personnel. It
     also keeps the pilot(s) away from hazardous dud areas. If possible, coordinate with the RCO
     prior to bailout in order to allow any personnel on-range to clear the area.
     3.3.2. Forced Landing. If an aircraft must make a forced landing within the impact area,
     aircrews must remain with the aircraft until range personnel can perform recovery operations,
     unless there is a risk of fire or explosion at the downed aircraft site. This is due to the high
     risk of unexploded ordnance in the area. If possible, establish radio contact with the RCO.
     3.3.3. Radio/Electrical Failure. Two-way radio communication with Falcon Range is
     required to expend ordnance on the range. In the event of radio failure on UHF primary
301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                25

   363.7, attempt contact on UHF secondary 342.3, UHF 243.0, and finally VHF 141.85.
   Depart the range if contact with the RCO is not reestablished.
   3.3.4. Emergency Airfields: Check current FLIP documents and NOTAMS for the current
   status of facilities at emergency airfields. The airfields depicted in Table 3.1, Emergency
   Divert Airfields, have a usable runway length greater than 7000 feet and are listed in order
   of proximity to the range; Henry Post AAF is the closest available runway but is only 5000’
   in length with no arresting gear.

                                             Chapter 4
                                      RCO PROCEDURES
4.1. RCO Procedures. RCO responsibilities and performance standards are outlined in core
personnel documents on file at Falcon Range.
     4.1.1. The RCO will ensure that the airspace is opened prior to the start of the first range
     period. Fort Sill Range Control will provide the opening check-in codes and the pyro status.
     Fort Sill will also verify the Officer-In-Charge during check-in.
     4.1.2. For hot range missions (actual ordnance and/or combat lasers) the RCO will ensure all
     personnel are out of the hazard area 15 minutes prior to the scheduled range time. This
     includes the use of roll-calls if verification is uncertain. The RCO will be in position NLT 20
     minutes prior to the scheduled start of the range time. The RCO will also ensure all required
     positions are manned NLT 15 minutes prior to the scheduled start of the range time.
     4.1.3. The RCO will ensure the Range Safety Pennant (Red Flag) is flying from the flagpole
     during times the airspace is active. The pennant will be lowered when the range ground and
     air spaces have been closed with Fort Sill.
     4.1.4. Before the first missions the RCO will verify operation of all radios, the hot line to
     Fort Sill Approach Control, and the digital voice recorder. The RCO will also verify that a
     range check has been accomplished, that all personnel including visitors are accounted for,
     and the targets are of suitable condition.
     4.1.5. At the conclusion of flying the RCO will verify that the airspace has been closed with
     Fort Sill Range Control.
        4.1.5.1. The checkout with Fort Sill includes number and type of aircraft on-range,
        personnel, ordnance number and type to include DODIC codes, and any special
        comments. Fort Sill will provide checkout codes.
        4.1.5.2. During scheduled extended periods of inactivity when the airspace is activated,
        the RCO should contact Fort Sill Approach Control in order to allow controlled through-
        flights of the range airspace by other aircraft.
4.2. RCO Training. The ROA is responsible for the training of new RCOs. The ROO will
maintain currency tracking and perform RCO quality control functions.
     4.2.1. Written Examination. The ROA will administer a written, open-book examination on
     applicable instructions, regulations, topics and issues. The exam will be prepared by the
     Range Training Office. Passing score is 85 percent. The exam will consist of 35 randomly
     selected multiple choice questions. The testing RCO is immediately decertified if the written
     examination is failed. If the RCO fails a second time, the RCO must re-accomplish the entire
     RCO training program. If the RCO fails a third time, the RCO will be dismissed from
     performing RCO duties.
     4.2.2. On-Range Demonstration consists of day and night qualification. Day qualification is
     a prerequisite to night qualification. The RCO trainee will observe one mission before
     controlling the same type of mission. Mission types are basic surface attack (BSA), surface
     attack tactics (SAT) and close air support (CAS).
301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                        27

       4.2.2.1. Day. Each upgrading RCO will observe a qualified RCO demonstrate proper
       methods and techniques for controlling aircraft during air-to-ground operations. After
       observing at least four flights conducting range operations, the upgrading RCO will
       control at least four flights (at least two 4-ships, if 4-ship flights frequently use the range)
       under the supervision of a qualified RCO.
       4.2.2.2. Night. Each upgrading RCO must observe at least one night flight and control at
       least one night flight of both BSA/SAT and CAS missions under the supervision of a
       qualified RCO.
       4.2.2.3. The ROA will maintain documentation of the training. The training folders will
       contain the certification letter signed by the OG/CC, training checklists, and individual
       mission grade sheets and training plan, as well as other certificates and supporting
       documentation.
4.3. Ordnance Delivery Clearance. There are no provisions for releasing ordnance on Falcon
Range without radio contact with the Range Control Officer, i.e. Class B/C operations. The
RCO may hand off final authority to other agencies IAW AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and
Procedures and JP 3-09.3. The RCO retains abort authority at all times.
4.4. Range Safety and Security.
   4.4.1. Safety. The RCO may not have a clear view of each possible attack axis or delivery
   event. Current generation fighter aircraft, employing high altitude tactics, may be difficult to
   acquire visually. Pilots must positively identify targets prior to expending ordnance.
   4.4.2. Do not point at or overfly manned sites during weapons delivery passes.
   4.4.3. Heavyweight inert munitions delivered at shallow dive angles travel beyond the target
   as far as 3000 meters after breaching. Some may change direction by as much as 30 degrees
   from the delivery heading. Pilots must adhere to run-in restrictions when employing
   heavyweight munitions, especially when using shallow delivery angles. Refer to Attachment
   9 for attack axis graphic displays.
   4.4.4. Security. Shared-use policies contribute to occasional unauthorized range entry. The
   RCO will request a clearing pass whenever there is any doubt as to range security. Refer to
   paragraph 2.15 for further information.
4.5. Visitor Procedures.
   4.5.1. All visitors to the range, whether directly involved in operations (e.g. JTACs),
   supporting operations (e.g. UXO demilitarization) or observation will sign the visitor log and
   receive a safety briefing before proceeding down-range. Visitors to the range operations
   complex only will sign the log but are exempt from the range safety briefing. This safety
   briefing is valid for six months. Fort Sill-assigned range personnel and 301st FW RCOs are
   exempt from this paragraph.
   4.5.2. In accordance with AFI 13-212 and Army Regulation (AR) 385-63, Range Safety,
   visitors not involved in the conduct of training operations will remain clear of the Hazard
   Area during weapons deliveries. Range personnel will provide escort or surveillance of
   visitors at all times, except for pre-briefed JTACs when performing mission-related duties,
   Fort Sill-assigned range personnel, and on-site subcontractors who have been briefed on their
   authorized locations. The RCO will verify that ordnance delivery patterns will not present
28                                                           301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013

     any hazard to visitors/spectators. The Footprint Book must show better than one in one
     million risk analysis for the location of visitors. Restrict deliveries if required (change
     targets, assign run-in restrictions). If operations must be conducted which subject the visitors
     to greater than a one in one million risk of weapons effects, then the visitors will be relocated
     to the range pennant at the south boundary road in accordance with AR 385-63.
        4.5.2.1. Time-critical or cost-prohibitive operations such as the installation or repair of
        infrastructure by outside agencies [contractors, vendors, engineers, etc] or deliveries of
        materiel may take precedence and require coordination with the aircrews to ensure safety.
        UXO destruction and relocation at the East Residue Area cannot be placed on hold due to
        time and funding constraints and may require the denial of certain delivery patterns or
        tactical events.
        4.5.2.2. JTACs may conduct missions within the Hazard Area in accordance with AFI
        11-214, AFI 13-212 and with the concurrence of Range Control. JTACs must be
        properly equipped in accordance with AFI 13-112V1, Joint Terminal Attack Controller
        (JTAC) Training Program, while inside the Hazard Area.
        4.5.2.3. Refer to Attachment 7, Manned Sites and OAPs, for a description of observation
        points and offset aim points.
     4.5.3. The normal location for visitors to observe range operations is the main tower.
     Visitors will be briefed on the risk factors of range operations. Visitors who are not
     comfortable with the risk will be relocated to the range pennant at the south boundary road.
4.6. Bird Conditions. Southwest Oklahoma lies within a migratory flyway for numerous bird
species. These range from small birds to raptors and large waterfowl. The most active time for
migratory bird activity is fall and early spring. The range includes habitats suitable for large
raptors such as hawks and vultures. These birds may be active at any time of the year. Vultures
in particular pose a threat to low-level aircraft since they may congregate in groups at altitudes as
high as 2000’ AGL.
     4.6.1. The RCO will report both the forecasted bird condition as reported by US AHAS and
     actual visual sightings or non-sightings during initial check-in and during the range
     operations.
4.7. Restricted Operations.
     4.7.1. A “check-fire” ordered by Fort Sill Range Control curtails all activities on Falcon
     Range. The RCO will direct aircraft to hold “high and dry” until Fort Sill Range Control
     allows further activity on Falcon Range.
        4.7.1.1. The RCO may allow dry operations with restrictions if allowed by the Fort Sill
        Fire Department during wildland firefighting operations. The Fire Chief has final
        authority over the range ground and air space.
     4.7.2. The Falcon Range RCO may restrict, suspend or curtail operations as required to
     ensure the safety of all personnel.
301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   29


                                           Chapter 5
            LASER OPERATIONS AND INERTIALLY-AIDED MUNITIONS
5.1. Coordination. Laser operations require prior coordination to allow public notification and
security on the range. Cancellations should be made as soon as possible to preclude unnecessary
activation of specialized range control procedures. Contact Falcon Range Control Officer at
DSN 639-6300 for approval of laser operations.
5.2. Approved Laser Systems. Falcon Range is certified by AFRL 711 HPW/RHDO for the
safe use of most DOD fielded fixed-wing, rotary-wing and man-portable laser systems. The
most recent AFRL 711 HPW/RHDO Optical Radiation Safety Consultative Letter, Falcon Range
Laser Safety Survey, is maintained at Falcon Range and at 301OG/CC, NAS Fort Worth JRB,
TX 76127-6200. Contact the Falcon Range Control Officer for approval of laser operations and
suitable laser, OP and target combinations, which are published in the Consultative Letter.
Tank-mounted systems were not evaluated and are not approved for use.
5.3. Laser Operations. Users requesting laser employment will contact the range prior to
employment. This allows the range to be completely cleared and for ground personnel to don
protective equipment. Short-notice requests may take up to 10 minutes to ensure all personnel
are clear of the Laser Surface Danger Zone (LSDZ) and have protective equipment.
   5.3.1. General. Ground personnel will wear approved laser eye protection which covers the
   laser wavelength with an optical density suitable for the laser employed. The RCO will
   announce before any laser activity the need to wear LEP before commencing laser
   operations. All personnel will leave the impact area unless actively involved in laser activity
   (i.e. JTACs performing laser operations).
       5.3.1.1. The RCO will not allow any lasers until complete accountability is established
       for all personnel. On-site personnel will check in with the RCO with their location and
       LEP status before the RCO allows laser activity.
       5.3.1.2. Ground-based laser designators and range-finders will not be fired above the
       horizon. Low-power markers may be fired above the horizon if approved by the
       Consultative Letter. The Green Beam Designator will not be used on Falcon Range.
       5.3.1.3. Ground-based systems will not be fired against any target or on any azimuth that
       allows the escape of laser energy from the range boundaries at an unsafe power level.
       Since this cannot normally be determined without extensive research and simulation, only
       the approved firing point/target combinations will be used. Under no circumstances will
       ground-based designators be fired on any azimuth except toward the north due to the
       proximity of populated areas and OK Highway 115.
   5.3.2. Aircraft Mounted Laser Systems. All authorized fixed-wing lasers may be employed
   from any direction, anywhere within the confines of restricted airspace, and on any target
   except for T-11 and T-18, or other targets as directed by the RCO. The minimum safe lasing
   altitude varies with the type of laser system employed and the distance of the designator
   aircraft from the target. Refer to Table 5.1, Airborne Laser Flight Profile Limitations.

Note: This table utilizes a 5 mrad buffer angle, high-power designator and a baseline 1400 feet
MSL target.

5.3.2.1. A depression angle of a minimum of 5° ensures that the LSDZ does not exceed
allowable limits. The absolute minimum angle for airborne laser designation is 3° unless cleared
following evaluation with the Laser Range Management Software. Lasing will not be performed
below 2000 feet AGL while crossing public highways or over-flight of housing areas, and will
not be performed below 3000 feet AGL / 5500 feet MSL over the Wichita Mountains Wildlife
Refuge.
     5.3.2. Man-Portable Laser Systems. Most DOD man-portable laser systems are approved
     for use at Falcon Range. There are several target and firing position combinations available.
     However, not all targets are accessible from all firing positions, and delivery restrictions
     further limit employment flexibility.
        5.3.3.1. Falcon Range has a Ground Laser Target Designator (GLTD) which can be used
        to designate certain targets for laser-spot search tactics. Normally in the main tower, it
        can be fired from the flank tower as well. Contact the range at least 3 hours in advance to
        coordinate its use.
        5.3.3.2. GLTD Employment. The range must be cleared prior to GLTD operations; no
        personnel are permitted inside the impact area during its operation. The operator of the
        GLTD will install the GLTD and SEE-SPOT combination on the camera pan-and-tilt
        device, and control the targeting from inside the tower. The operator will test its balance
        and make corrections before connecting the power supply. The RCO will make a “laser
        hot” radio call, and direct all personnel to wear LEP. Only then may the operator open
        the apertures (remove the protective covers) from the GLTD. After the SEE-SPOT is
        ready for use, ensure the GLTD and SEE-SPOT are boresighted, and make corrections.
        The operator then will test fire against T-4 to ensure boresight. At no time must the
        GLTD fire above the horizon. Only approved targets may be engaged, refer to the AFRL
        711 HPW/RHDO Optical Radiation Safety Consultative Letter. When not firing, ensure
        the protective covers are reinstalled.
        5.3.3.3. Verify the PRF code with any sensor(s) before firing the GLTD.
301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   31

       5.3.3.4. After firing is completed, disable the GLTD by disconnecting the power first,
       and then disconnect the pan-and-tilt controls.
       5.3.3.5. Falcon Range possesses two Infrared Zoom Laser Illuminator Designators
       (IZLIDs) and one GCP-1A Ground Commander’s Pointer. These and any other markers
       will only be employed with the operator wearing both NVGs and LEP. Use extreme
       caution when firing an IZLID from the tower; ensure that the tower catwalk rails are not
       in the way of firing. From the main and flank tower, operators will use the turret with the
       IZLIDs.
          5.3.3.5.1. Operators of the IZLID and GCP will keep the aperture covers on unless
          firing. As soon as the firing is completed, replace the cover. For the IZLID, ensure
          the key is installed before firing, otherwise the unit will not designate. Remove the
          key before transport after firing.
          5.3.3.5.2. The IZLIDs and GCP are stored in the GSA safe. When taking a laser
          marker out of the safe, sign it out and indicate the time of return when finished.
          Spare batteries are kept in the tower. Only test the IZLID or GCP from the tower or
          OP, and always ensure the area downrange is safe. Treat any laser as a loaded
          weapon.
   5.3.4. Approved Ordnance. Only inert GBU-10/12/16 and Laser Guided Training Rounds
   (LGTRs) may be employed at Falcon Range. No live munitions or any form of GBU-24,
   GBU-27 or GBU-28 may be employed at Falcon Range.
       5.3.4.1. Restrictions. The WDZ for GBU-10/12/16 Laser Guided Bombs restricts
       delivery flexibility. Parameters and targets are restricted in both dive angle and attack
       heading. Off-range or out-of-impact-area impacts are a possibility unless the final attack
       restrictions are followed absolutely. Contact the Falcon Range RCO for weather back-up
       options. The restrictions for LGTRs and approved GBUs are listed in Attachment 9.
   5.3.5. Logging laser use. The RCO will document the laser use with the range laser log.
   This log will be compiled and maintained on the shared drive, and is reported to both AFRC
   and Fort Sill Range Control annually. The log includes the number and type of aircraft, if
   any, as well as the type of laser, the targets engaged, the RCO and LSO, and the times on and
   off. It is maintained for a minimum of 5 years.
5.4. Laser Safety. The RCO will terminate all laser operations if unauthorized personnel are
observed in the LSDZ, in the event of equipment malfunction, or anytime laser safety cannot be
assured. Pilots must cease active laser operations anytime the intended target is lost from the
field of view. Any laser incidents will be promptly reported in accordance with the 711th HPW
reporting protocols. A copy of the incident checklist is kept in the RCO Quick Reference
Checklist.
5.5. Laser Scoring. Four laser scoring systems are available. All four systems require prior
notice for set-up.
   5.5.1. The Large Scale Target Sensor System (LSTSS) is located in the LTA and consists of
   a down-range power supply and communications node, a 30-foot tower, and two sensors.
   The downrange transmitter is part of the communications node, and communicates with the
   operator’s scoring station. The LSTSS is a static system, which can score a number of
   designated targets on specific laser-to-target lines (LTL). Not all targets and/or DPIs in the
32                                                           301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013

     LTA can be scored, and the sensors can only score the side(s) of the target facing the sensors.
     Some DPIs are within the field of view of more than one sensor, but with a different sensor-
     to-target axis. Refer to Attachment 10 for LTA DPIs and laser scoring capabilities.
        5.5.1.1. Aircrews requesting use of the LSTSS should contact Falcon Range prior to the
        mission to ensure the system is operating and to allow the operator time to initiate the
        scoring sequence. On-range, the aircrews will provide the PRF (laser code) to the RCO
        to ensure the sensors acquire the correct laser spot. Aircrews will also provide the
        specific DPI and expected LTL to allow the LSTSS operator to assign the correct sensor
        to the target array and score the correct DPI. If the actual DPI name is not known,
        describe the target in relation to other targets (e.g. “third small building from the south in
        a north-south row”) to allow the proper scoring setup.
        5.5.1.2. The LSTSS captures laser energy and graphically depicts the centroid of the
        laser spot to the operator, who can provide a score in feet and clock position based on the
        (LTL). If the laser energy is not visible to the sensor no score will be provided. This
        may be a result of lasing a vertical target on a side away from the sensor.
     5.5.2. The range has a Laser Spot Visual Recorder System (LSVRS) which uses a pair of
     cameras to score laser energy during day or night operations. The system visually displays
     laser energy as it hits a target within the cameras’ field of view as a light spot, and can be
     slewed to different targets. The aircrew only needs to a fire combat laser (1064 nm) at the
     desired target. Aircrews will also provide the specific DPI and expected LTL to allow the
     LSTSS operator to score the correct DPI. If the actual DPI name is not known, describe the
     target in relation to other targets (e.g. “third small building from the west in a east-west
     row”) to allow the proper scoring setup. Horizontal targets cannot be scored. If the laser
     energy is not within the camera field of view, it cannot be scored. Additionally, the operator
     may reduce the scoring volume to preclude interference from affecting the score. If the spot
     is inside the field of view but not the scoring volume on the target, the spot will be visible but
     no score will be displayed. The LSVRS can, at aircrew request, transmit a tone over the
     range frequency if the laser energy is within the designated scoring volume. The tone can
     also be disabled if requested.
        5.5.2.1. Aircrews may request a copy of the displayed data, usually in an MPEG or AVI
        format. Contact the range before flight to coordinate an electronic or CD/DVD copy.
     5.5.3. Both the LSTSS and LSVRS require aircrews to designate on specific targets within
     the LTA. The targets are approximately 1 meter square with a black outline around a white
     square. The targets face their respective sensor and can only be scored on specific laser-to-
     target lines. Refer to Attachment 10 for details.
     5.5.4. Falcon Range has a single Laser Evaluator System-Mobile (LES-M) that can be used
     to validate laser designation and ensure properly bore sighted targeting pods and laser
     designators. When a laser designator (combat) illuminates the LES-M, it transits a chopped
     tone over the range frequency. This gives aircrews immediate feedback regarding their laser
     systems. The tone is low-power and can be overridden by aircraft and RCO radios. The size
     of the footprint the laser produces is based on range and elevation from the laser to the target.
     At close range (inside of 1000 feet/300 meters slant range) side lobes may trigger the LES-M
     to transmit when the centroid of the laser spot is not exactly on the LES-M. For slant ranges
     of greater than 1000 feet the LES-M will not trigger unless the laser spot is centered within 3
301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                   33

   feet (1 meter) of the LES-M. For the case where the designator is a long distance from the
   target (24,500 feet/7500 meters), the spot may be as large as 12 feet in diameter, depending
   on the designator. In this case, there is enough amplitude variation within the main beam that
   the box still scores accurately within the 3 foot radius.
      5.5.4.1. The LES-M is mobile and can be placed on or near any targets. However, it
      makes that target a no-drop target with a 500-meter no-drop radius around the LES-M.
      For daily use it is located on a slightly raised platform within the LTA, but it may also be
      placed on no-drop targets or on a vehicle parked adjacent to a no-drop when requested.
      The LES-M can be placed in the bed of a tactical vehicle, which gives aircrews a tactical
      target to observe.
      5.5.4.2. The RCO will provide the coordinates of the LES-M, or flight leads can call
      ahead and ask for a specific target as part of a scenario. The LES-M requires a power
      supply (small generator) so plan accordingly. It will not be placed on-range unless
      requested. LES-M setup outside the LTA requires a minimum of two hours advance
      notice.
   5.5.5. Falcon Range possesses a SEE-SPOT III which is an IR camera system that integrates
   a laser seeker. This laser seeker allows the viewing of a combat laser spot (1064 nanometers)
   under most conditions, although night allows better IR contrast. The RCO can assess the
   aircraft’s targeting pod accuracy with this system. The SEE-SPOT requires one hour for
   setup.
      5.5.5.1. The SEE-SPOT is usually in the main tower but can be placed in other locations.
      Because it is a manual system the location is manned, so no munitions may be dropped
      near the SEE-SPOT. If a target cannot be viewed from the SEE-SPOT operator’s
      location, it cannot be scored. Additionally, if the aircraft is illuminating a target with
      vertical development, then the operator may not be able to view the laser spot if it is on
      the side of the target that is obscured.
5.6. Inertially Aided Munitions (IAMs):
   5.6.1. Inertially aided munitions include the GBU-31(V)1 and GBU-31(V)3, GBU-32, and
   GBU-38 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (J-DAM), the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb, and
   the CBU-103, CBU-104, and CBU-105 Wind-Corrected Munitions Dispensers (WCMD),
   and follow-on weapons such as the LJDAM and Dual-Mode Laser-Guided Bomb (DMLGB).
   5.6.2. The WDZs for IAMs dictate restricted deliveries at most Class A ranges. Unrestricted
   simulated weapons deliveries (dry-only) are authorized where there is no chance of an actual
   release using aircraft-specific dry practice procedures. Aircrew will ensure that no actual
   munitions are selected.
   5.6.3. Actual IAM employment is authorized with the following restrictions:
      5.6.3.1. Ordnance. Inert GBU-31s, -36s, -38s -44s and -54s are the only authorized
      IAMs.
      5.6.3.2. Targets. GBU-31s and GBU-44s are only authorized on Target T-2. GBU-36s,
      -38s and -54s are authorized on Targets T-2, T-12 and T-20.
      5.6.3.3. Weapons Parameters. Aircrews will set a minimum impact angle of 65º for the
      weapon, and will attack the target with no more than 10º offset from a direct attack (i.e.
34                                                          301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013

         target displaced no more than 10º from the flight path of the aircraft) at release. Refer to
         Table 5.2, J-DAM Weapons Parameters, for airspeeds and release ranges.

         5.6.3.4. Airspace. Actual J-DAM deliveries are restricted to employment from over R-
         5601B on a weapons attack heading of 250º to 270º (260º ± 10º). This requires at least
         24 hours’ prior coordination to ensure separation from artillery in R-5601B. No attacks
         from the west are authorized due to the risk of an off-range impact outside of government
         property.
         5.6.3.5. Weapon Delivery Modes. Weapons modes that utilize a preplanned coordinate
         as the target such as Continuously Computed Release Point (CCRP) and Bomb on
         Coordinate (BOC) modes are authorized. Reference aircraft specific procedures for
         limitations. Aircrew will pre-coordinate attacks and delivery modes with the RCO before
         takeoff.
     5.6.4. Triple Check. Each aircraft will accomplish three independent safety checks (two
     person minimum) before releasing a J-DAM on Falcon Range. These checks must ensure
     accurate coordinates are loaded into the weapon memory prior to release.
         5.6.4.1. The aircrew will verify their coordinates via telephone with the RCO during
         mission planning. (Check #1)
         5.6.4.2. During taxi out, the aircrew will confirm with their SOF, SDO or Operations
         personnel the target coordinates as loaded into the aircraft with a read-back. (Check #2)
         5.6.4.3. On range, radio confirmation of the weapon memory coordinates to the RCO or
         a JTAC is a required safety check for all aircraft. The aircrew read directly to the RCO
         or JTAC the coordinates for the weapon memory. (Check #3) Additional checks are
         aircraft specific.
         5.6.4.4. If equipped, each aircraft will also verify that the aircraft system is properly
         targeted through the use of heads-up display symbology and/or targeting systems
         (targeting pods).
5.7. Directed-Energy Weapons. Directed-Energy Weapons will not be employed at Fort Sill
and Falcon Range.
301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                       35

                                   THREAT SIMULATION
6.1. Resources. Falcon Range provides visual and electronic threat simulators support upon
request, consistent with available resources. Call Falcon Range at DSN 639-6300 for assistance.
6.2. Visual Threat Simulators. Falcon Range possesses one four-shot Smokey SAM launcher,
and two four-missile MANPAD simulators. The range also has one AAA simulator which
presents a visual indication of a 57mm anti-aircraft battery. IED simulators may also be
available; these simulators provide a visual indication of a ground explosion. The launchers are
portable and may be located at a variety of locations on the range, depending upon user
requirements. The ROA must approve employment of the visual threat simulators. Falcon
Range will then employ the system as directed by the flight lead.
   6.2.1. Coordination. The use of visual threat simulators requires prior coordination. All
   visual threat simulators are subject to availability restrictions; due to funding and storage
   requirements the simulators are not usually available without significant lead time.
   6.2.2. Employment. Falcon Range personnel will employ visual threat simulators at the
   flight leader’s discretion, from the location and at the distance and time requested so that the
   desired learning objective is obtained. If the flight lead does not brief a specific location, the
   RCO will designate a launch location consistent with the pyro status and clear of active
   targets.
   6.2.3. Safety. Falcon Range personnel will establish a missile launch site that will ensure a
   minimum of 2000 feet of vertical and lateral clearance from the flight’s anticipated ground
   track. If the RCO or missile launch personnel perceive that an aircraft might violate the
   2000-foot clear zone, the launch effort will be aborted.
6.3. Electronic Threat Simulators. Falcon Range has three threat emitter systems for
electronic warfare (EW) training. Two AN/UPQ-8(V) systems are available, one RWR-LITE
and one RWT. These offer mid- and high-band threat simulations. Also, for HARM training, a
HARM Target Emitter (HTE) is available. For further information about the capabilities of these
EW simulators, call Falcon Range.
   6.3.1. Coordination. The use of electronic simulators requires prior coordination. Schedule
   EW support at least one hour before employment, so range personnel can assemble and set
   up the simulator. Certain weather conditions, such as high winds and/or blowing dust, may
   require the RWR-LITE or RWT to be stowed.
   6.3.2. Employment. Falcon Range personnel will employ EW at the flight leader’s
   discretion, from the location and at the distance and time requested. Flight leaders should
   thoroughly brief the RCO so that desired effect is obtained. If the flight lead asks for the
   RCO’s option, or does not indicate a specific location, then the flight members can expect a
   randomly chosen origin for the EW emissions. The HTE is in a fixed site near the operations
   center at Falcon Range.
   6.3.3. Target acquisition. The threat emitters will be set up at locations outside the Falcon
   Range Impact Area. The RWR-LITE and RWT can be taken off-range and placed near low-
   level routes or within the adjoining MOAs. It is possible that the aircraft is acquired late or
   not at all due to terrain, aircraft altitude, weather, sun angle, or other tactical considerations.
36                                                           301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013

     The threat emitters do not actually acquire an airborne target and track it; rather, the operator
     places the optical sight on the target and illuminates the aircraft while holding the sight on
     the target. This requires visual acquisition and emitter slewing by the operators. The HTE is
     a static emitter only, and covers a lane for anti-radiation missile training.
     6.3.4. Termination. Falcon Range personnel will cease all training EW emissions any time
     the aircrew transmits “TERMINATE” or “KNOCK-IT-OFF”.
6.4. Electronic Countermeasures. The use of combat electronic jamming in R-5601 is
prohibited. Training chaff is authorized in accordance with AFI 11-214. Prior coordination with
Falcon Range is required. No combat chaff may be expended in R-5601 at any time.

Forward Air Controller/Joint Terminal Attack Controller (FAC/JTAC) training. Falcon Range
personnel are not instructors, but do facilitate training and help ensure safety. Note: Do not
confuse CAS training at Falcon Range and similar training with Army student controllers on Fort
Sill’s West Range. Refer to Fort Sill Regulation 385-1 for West Range information.
   7.1.1. Facilities. To support CAS training, Falcon Range offers a combined briefing and
   training facility for TDY personnel. No overnight lodging facilities are available. Overnight
   operations within the adjacent training ranges (bivouac operations) require authorization and
   briefings from Fort Sill Range Control; Falcon Range cannot authorize overnight operations.
   There are two full bathrooms with shower facilities, a full kitchen, and a break area. The
   facility is available at no cost. Contact Falcon Range at DSN 639-6300 for details.
   7.1.2. Scheduling. See paragraph 1.2, Scheduling, for general information. Falcon Range
   does not schedule fighter/attack resources for CAS missions, only the range airspace. Users
   must ensure there are no conflicts with West Range. Ground and air units that desire to
   conduct CAS training at Falcon Range must jointly coordinate their schedules with Falcon
   Range to avoid conflicts with other users.
   7.1.3. Operations. Falcon Range will support CAS training at the requested level.
   Generally, the RCO will complete administrative actions (range clearance, special
   instructions, and restrictions) on the Falcon Range primary frequency, 363.7. If the JTAC
   requests a separate frequency, the RCO will then hand off the flight to the JTAC on Falcon
   Range secondary frequency, 342.3. This action separates administrative and combat training
   functions. If the target can be scored, the RCO will score each hot pass but will not transmit
   weapons scores unless requested. Scores will be forwarded to participating units by fax or
   email, as appropriate.
   7.1.4. JTAC Locations. JTACs may use any of several locations to conduct their operations.
   These locations include either the Main or Flank Towers, and any location outside the impact
   area. JTACs may control weapons delivery sorties from within the impact area provided the
   following conditions are met:
       7.1.4.1. The mission is dry (no ordnance, or if combat lasers are employed, the JTACs
       are located outside all laser hazard zones), or;
       7.1.4.2. The Falcon Range RCO conducts a risk analysis using the weapons safety
       program and approves the proposed location, and;
       7.1.4.3. The mission is conducted from the surveyed observation points.
       7.1.4.4. The JTAC is no closer than 500 meters to the closest planned target.
       7.1.4.5. The aircraft are employing only practice munitions.
       7.1.4.6. The pilot has visually confirmed the JTAC location.
38                                                         301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013

        7.1.4.7. The pilot does not point at or overfly the JTAC location during roll-in, track or
        recovery.
        7.1.4.8. If practical, an RCO-qualified member should accompany the JTAC. (Single
        RCO procedures, such as extended duty hours, may preclude this.)
     7.1.5. Surveyed JTAC observation points will have a small metal building nearby, with
     orange and white markings on top in order to provide a readily identifiable location.
     7.1.6. Safety. Pilots, JTACs, and the RCO share the responsibility for conducting CAS
     operations safely. When personnel occupy locations within the impact area, every weapons
     delivery pass presents ground personnel with potential hazards. The RCO and JTAC must
     continually assess the risk level of these operations. JTACs and RCOs will abort
     questionable weapons delivery passes, and will terminate CAS operations if and when any
     member’s comfort level is exceeded.
        7.1.6.1. The RCO generally has a better vantage point from which to view the aircraft,
        and has the ultimate responsibility for the safe conduct of the range operations. The RCO
        can abort for safety reasons any aircraft without the permission of the JTAC.
7.2. Fort Sill West Range. Fixed wing air operations at Fort Sill support training of personnel
in formal artillery school courses, operational joint force training, and service unique
continuation training. The applicable instruction is Fort Sill Regulation 385-1, available for
download from the Fort Sill web site (http://sill-www.army.mil) in PDF format. Aircrews
utilizing the Fort Sill West Range are required to review the regulation before operating within
the range airspace. Content and changes to the Army regulation supersede this instruction.
Aircrews are responsible for complying with the procedures outlined within the Army directives
and all governing regulations. Bring conflicts to the attention of the Air Force 6th CTS
Detachment, DSN 639-1766/-3855 or commercial (580) 442-1766/-3855, or Range Control.
     7.2.1. Scheduling. Units desiring to schedule range missions for unit level continuation
     training must realize that Army requirements for use of the range will have priority over
     aircrew training. To schedule unit level continuation training, contact the Air Force 6th CTS
     Detachment, DSN 639-1766/-3855 or commercial (580) 442-1766/-3855. This agency will
     coordinate range times and locations with Range Control, Falcon Range, and ARAC.
     7.2.2. Target Area Information. The West Range Impact Area, (for aircraft usage), consists
     of three CAS target areas, CAS Box 1, CAS Box 2 and CAS Box 3. In addition, dry
     missions over the Fort Sill Garrison may be conducted in support of various joint training
     programs.
        7.2.2.1. CAS Box 1 is the western target array, with the primary targets located at ND
        444394 (N 34º41.750’ W 098º30.939’).
        7.2.2.2. CAS Box 2 is the central target array, with the primary targets located at ND
        474378 (N 34º40.865’ W 098º28.979’).
        7.2.2.3. CAS Box 3 is an inert-only target array 1900 meters northeast of CAS Box 2,
        with the primary targets located at ND 492391 (N 34º41.544’ W 098º27.798’).
     7.2.3. Authorized weapons. Fort Sill Regulation 385-1 provides detailed information on the
     weapons authorized on the West Range Impact Area. A variety of live, inert and training
     munitions may be employed on the targets.
301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                 39

   7.2.4. Artillery missions may operate simultaneously with fixed-wing operations. Aircrews
   will adhere to airspace control area lateral and altitude limits if artillery is active when
   briefed by ARAC, the JTAC, or Range Control.
   7.2.5. The approach corridors to Henry Post AAF are located within two NM of West
   Range. Use caution in the vicinity of Henry Post AAF.
   7.2.6. Refer to Attachment 11, Fort Sill Initial/Contact Points and Communication Grid, for
   a list of initial and contact points and the radio frequencies used at Fort Sill.
7.3. Range Control. Fort Sill Range Control (DSN 639-2994, -2008) is the final approving
authority for all operations within R-5601. Aircraft will cease operations and depart restricted
airspace immediately upon request from Range Control.

capability.
Class B Range – A manned or unmanned range with scoring capability, but no range control
officer.
Comprehensive Range Plan (CRP) – The range commander‘s plan, approved by the
MAJCOM, that establishes the vision with supporting goals and develops the strategy for
attaining the vision through objectives and an implementation approach.
Essential Personnel – Those personnel on a range participating in a test, training or evaluation
scenario involving the employment of ordnance (air/surface/sea) including Mission Essential
Personnel and those personnel not required for ordnance employment including maneuver
elements, opposition forces, instructors, evaluators, etc.
Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) – The detection, identification, on-site evaluation,
rendering safe, recovery, and final disposal of unexploded explosive ordnance. It may
also include explosive ordnance that has become hazardous by damage or deterioration.
Guard – A radio frequency that is normally used for emergency transmissions and is
continuously monitored. UHF band: 243.0 MHZ; VHF band: 121.5 MHZ.
Hazard Areas – The Hazard Area is a composite of all WDZs and surface danger zones
(SDZs) for all authorized weapon delivery events against targets or DPIs approved for actual
ordnance expenditures. Public access to Hazard Areas is prohibited unless specifically
authorized by the ROA.
Impact Areas – The Impact Area is that area on a range immediately surrounding the
target(s) or designated mean point(s) of impact approved for actual ordnance delivery.
Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) – Rules governing the procedures for conducting instrument
flight. Also a term used by pilots and controllers to indicate type of flight plan.
Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) – Meteorological conditions expressed in
terms of visibility, distance from cloud, and ceiling; less than minimums specified for visual
meteorological conditions.
Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) – An individual qualified IAW JP3-09.3 to
provide terminal control for the delivery of weapons by aircraft.
Military Operations Area (MOA) – Airspace designated for nonhazardous military activity,
established outside the Class A airspace (below 18,000 feet MSL).
Military Training Route (MTR) – A low-level, high-speed training route established IAW
criteria in FAA Joint Order 7610.4, Special Operations. MTRs are used by DoD to conduct
low altitude navigation and tactical training, in instrument and visual weather conditions,
below an altitude of 10,000 feet MSL and at airspeeds more than 250 KIAS. Routes are
established as IFR routes (IR) or VFR routes (VR). The FAA has approval authority to
implement IRs and the appropriate MAJCOM approves VR implementation. Environmental
documentation is required for implementation IAW AFI 32-7061. VRs are processed through
the FAA via the AFREP. MTRs are published in FLIP AP/1B and charted on FAA Sectionals
and DoD Low IFR charts. AFREPs assign all route numbers.
301FWI13-212 8 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                  45

Mission Essential Personnel – Those personnel on a range directly required for the
employment of ordnance (air/surface/sea) in a test, training or evaluation scenario. This may
include JTACs, range control officers, scorers, and any other personnel identified as required.
Night Vision Device (NVD) – Any electro-optical device that is used to detect visible and
infrared energy and provide a visible image. Night vision goggles, forward-looking infrared,
thermal sights, and low-light level television are night vision devices.
Night Vision Goggles(s) (NVG) – An electro-optical image intensifying device that detects
visible and near-infrared energy, intensifies the energy, and provides a visible image for night
viewing. Night vision goggles can be either hand-held or helmet-mounted.
Notice to Airman (NOTAM) – A notice containing information concerning the establishment,
condition, or change in any aeronautical facility, service, procedures, or hazard, the timely
knowledge of which is essential to personnel concerned with flight operations.
Range Control Officer (RCO) – The person responsible for range operations and safety.
Except in situations where the RCO delegates weapons release clearance to a qualified flight
lead, individual pilot or Forward Air Controller, or other briefed person.
Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) – An unmanned aircraft flown remotely from a ground or
air control station. May also referred to as an unmanned aerial vehicle, or UAV.
Supervisor of Flying (SOF) – A rated officer authorized by the flying unit commander to
monitor and supervise current flight operations. A Supervisor of Flying may perform duties
from the control tower.
Surface Danger Zones (SDZ) – The ground and airspace designated for vertical and lateral
containment of a user-determined percentage of projectiles, fragments, debris, and components
resulting from the firing, launching, or detonation of weapon systems including demolitions.
Visual Flight Rules (VFR) – Rules that govern the procedures for conducting flight under
visual conditions. The term VFR is also used in the United States to indicate weather
conditions that are equal to or greater than minimum VFR requirements. In addition, it is
used by pilots and controllers to indicate type of flight plan.
Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) – Weather conditions in which visual flight rules
apply; expressed in terms of visibility, ceiling height, and aircraft clearance from clouds
along the path of flight. When these criteria do not exist, instrument meteorological conditions
prevail and instrument flight rules must be complied with.
Weapons Danger Zone (WDZ) – The ground and airspace for lateral and vertical
containment of a user-determined percentage of projectiles, fragments, debris, and components
resulting from the firing, launching, and/or detonation of aviation delivered ordnance. This
three-dimensional zone accounts for weapon accuracy, failures, ricochets, and broaches
(resurfacing) of a specific weapon/munitions type delivered by a specific aircraft type. Where
software-selectable, this instruction requires 99.9999% containment (1:1,000,000 escapement)
or better for all fires, whether SDZs, aviation-delivered gun ammunition, or all other aviation-
delivered ordnance, in accordance with Fort Sill Regulation 385-1.

Notes:
1. Sub-scale munitions include BDU-33, MK-76, etc.
2. Low-altitude ingress and pop-up or fly-up is restricted to west-to-east (080º) run-in headings.
3. Short distance from south boundary to target areas precludes north roll-in.
4. Do not over fly main or flank tower; do not release weapons when pointing at main or flank
tower.
5. Heavyweight munitions, delivered from shallow dive angles, travel as far as 3000 meters and
can change direction by as much as 30°after breaching.
6. These restrictions may be modified with the concurrence of Falcon Range after computing
weapons footprints using the ACC-approved footprint program.
7. Ensure releases take place within the restricted airspace.
8. Some weapons events place the weapons danger zones outside the impact area. These events
can still be performed but prior coordination (as much as 8 weeks) is required with Fort Sill in
order to allow the events. Users must call the range in advance to ensure the adjacent training
areas are clear.
9. High-angle strafe on the scored HAS target is restricted to 080º ± 10º.
