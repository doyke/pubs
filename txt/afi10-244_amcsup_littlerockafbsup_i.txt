                                          Chapter 1

            AIR AND SPACE EXPEDITIONARY FORCE (AEF) CONCEPTS

1.1. General. The AEF is the Air Force’s methodology for organizing, training, equipping, and
sustaining rapidly responsive air and space forces to meet defense strategy requirements.
Through the AEF, the Air Force supports defense strategy requirements using a combination of
both permanently assigned and rotational (allocated) forces.
   1.1.1. How to use this AFI. This AFI governs Unit Type Code (UTC) status reporting. This
   instruction should be followed in the context of AFI 10-401 Air Force Operations Planning
   and Execution, which contains planning considerations for these UTCs and a full description
   of AEF concepts. Chapter 1 contains the basic description of the AEF and AEF UTC
   Reporting Tool (ART). Chapter 2 outlines roles and responsibilities in UTC reporting.
   Chapter 3 describes assessment and reporting policies.
1.2. Force Presentation. The United States Air Force (USAF) has organized its Total Force
into AEFs. Available Air Force unit type codes (UTCs) have been equitably aligned across ten
AEFs so each possesses roughly equal capabilities. The Air Force develops and tailors force
packages to meet mission requirements. Specifically tailored forces are presented to theater
commanders as Air and Space Expeditionary Task Forces (AETFs). Refer to Air Force Doctrine
Document (AFDD) 2 for doctrinal guidance on force presentation. The AEF will include
strategic ―enabler‖ or common user assets, such as long-range mobility, Special Operations
Forces (SOF), and space forces, that will provide support to authorized organizations within and
outside of the Department of Defense (DOD), including Air Force movements of AEF forces.
Also postured as enablers, the Air Force’s Limited Supply/High Demand (LS/HD) assets (U2, E-
8 JSTARS, E-3 AWACS, RC-135 RIVET JOINT, SOF, CSAR, etc.), will play critical roles in
AEF operations, subject to the governing directives of the Global Military Force Policy (GMFP).
1.3. Spectrum of Operations. The National Military Strategy dictates that the Air Force be
prepared to support requirements across the spectrum of operations from humanitarian and
disaster relief operations up to and including major war (MW). The Air Force will meet its day-
to-day steady-state deployed operational commitments using the UTCs assigned to the two on-
call AEFs, one on-call AEW, and available enabler forces. Any substantial or sustained
commitment of forces beyond this level will constitute a surge for the Air Force, which will
require some degree of reconstitution of the involved forces after the surge ends.
1.4. Force Management. The AEF libraries contain a finite amount of capability that at any
given time identifies forces that constitute the total force that has been made available or
allocated for scheduling. The 10 AEFs are paired (e.g. AEF 1 and 2, AEF 3 and 4, etc.) into five
4-month contingency on-call/deployment eligibility period every 20 months. Most LS/HD assets,
as defined in GMFP, are not formally assigned to individual AEFs but are postured in the
Enabler library and will rotate as operational requirements dictate. Deployment levels must be
consistent with GMFP guidelines. Air refueling forces and medium-range airlift forces (currently
consisting of C-130 units) will be assigned to AEFs and enabler operations, subject to careful
scheduling to avoid over tasking.
1.5. Reporting AEF Status - General . To view the health of forces in the ten (10) designated
AEF's, AEWs, lead mobility wings and enablers, Air Force senior leadership determined a need
 6                                              AFI10-244_AMCSUP_I 11 SEPTEMBER 2006


to collect UTC readiness status data from all AEF-allocated UTCs of sufficient detail to support
the following goals:
     1.5.1. Provide HQ USAF, AF Component Commanders, MAJCOM's, and AFPC/DPW
     readiness information to employ, manage, and sustain AEF operations.
     1.5.2. Provide units a mechanism to report a UTC’s current and future (6 months out) ability
     or inability to fulfill its Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP) across the full ROMO, to
     include contingency and rotational operations, and highlight associated deficiencies within
     the UTC.
     1.5.3. Provide information to aid resource allocation and tasking decisions during steady
     state and crisis actions.
1.6. System Description: The AEF UTC Status Reporting Tool (ART) is designed to support
the goals listed above. ART allows AEF-allocated units the ability to report UTC level readiness
data. It provides one central location to archive reported data. It allows immediate updates and
ready access to an aggregate UTC status for all levels of command with sufficient depth of
information to make informed decisions on the employment of forces for AEF operations. It
further provides a means for identifying and analyzing actionable indicators of change.
     1.6.1. ART is a web-based, non-intrusive, html-environment tool with associated databases
     to support collection, collation, and report generation of unit and aggregate UTC readiness
     data. It resides on the SIPRNET (https://aefcenter.afpc.randolph.af.smil.mil/) for secure
     access. Units that are levied UTC taskings under AEF, view and report their status against
     these taskings directly within the ART application.
     1.6.2. ART's report generating capability allows all levels of command to arrange data to
     produce tailored written reports and graphics. The reports section is read-only and can be
     accessed by anyone with SIPRNET access.
     1.6.3. A       fully   functional    training      site    exists      on    the     NIPRNET
     (https://aefcenter.afpc.randolph.af.mil/). This site also allows personnel to review the ART
     tutorial and other guidance. There are no restrictions on this site; anyone can login and enter
     training data or experiment with the report section. DO NOT enter real world data on the
     training site.
     1.6.4. Operationally, ART supports the goals stated above by collecting and collating unit-
     reported data to answer, in whole or in part, the following associated questions:
        1.6.4.1. Are AEF allocated UTCs able to accomplish their MISCAP defined mission if
        tasked today? If tasked any time within the next six months?
        1.6.4.2. Are AEF allocated UTCs able to accomplish their component tasked mission?
        1.6.4.3. Do adequate resources exist and is training available in order to accomplish and
        sustain the AEF mission(s)?
     1.6.5. ART complements readiness data reported in Status of Resources and Training
     Systems (SORTS). ART focuses reporting on the modular scalable capability-based UTC’s
     designed to meet the needs of the 21st century force while SORTS is unit-centric with
     reporting based on major war (MW) commitments. The basis for both systems is the AEF
     Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) library (Once the UTC Availability Module
AFI10-244_AMCSUP_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 5 MAY 2010                                                 7


  (UTA) is available in DCAPES, it will be the basis.). The tasking baseline contained in ART
  is derived from the AEF Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) library which
  supports the range of military operations (ROMO). Readiness assessments for MW and AEF
  tasking must be considered together; however, the reporting guidelines for each may be
  independent. A unit’s C level as reported in SORTS may not directly correlate to its ability to
  support a specific UTC tasking as indicated in ART.

                           ORGANIZATION RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. ART Reporting. Unit commander assessments reported in ART present the status of each
UTC in the AEF library; and they provide higher levels of command the necessary information
to make force and resource allocation decisions to effectively support theater commanders.
Within the AEF construct, the UTC assessments are used to determine the most effective force
tasking. Effective management of Air Force resources requires accurate information at all levels.
For these reasons integrity in reporting an accurate status is paramount. ART is not a report card,
but a method of identifying a UTCs ability to perform its MISCAP and identify shortages of
resources therefore, commanders must "tell it like it is."
2.2. Headquarters USAF.

                                  REPORTING POLICIES

3.1. Classification. ART contains real world deployment and personnel data. It is incumbent on
all personnel to be aware of the classification of data entered in ART. A UTC assessments in
ART is classified confidential, aggregate unit UTC reports are classified secret IAW Executive
Order (EO) 12958. Do not enter data that is classified under other guidance such as "Special
Access Required" information.
3.2. ART Data Classification. Executive Order (EO) 12958, Classified National Security
Information, requires us to protect classified information while striking a balance between
protection and the need to inform the American public of their governmental activities.
Additionally, this EO increases and emphasizes personal responsibility for classification and
declassification decisions.
   3.2.1. Derivative Classification. Derivative classification is the incorporating, paraphrasing,
   restating, or generating in a new form information that is already classified, and marking the
   newly developed material consistent with the classification markings that apply on the source
   information.
       3.2.1.1. Derivative Classifier. Persons applying derivative classification markings must
       carry forward to any newly created document the classification markings from the
       original source or document.
       3.2.1.2. ART assessment data (i.e., color codes, missing resources detailed in remarks,
       and limiting factors) for a single UTC, is classified at a minimum CONFIDENTIAL.
       3.2.1.3. Aggregate ART assessments (two or more UTC assessments) are classified
       SECRET. ART data converted to a new type information must be evaluated for its impact
       on national security if released.
       3.2.1.4. Data classification. Raw resource data used to derive UTC assessments is
       classified IAW it’s original source. When data is directly associated with an ART rating
       or used in an ART worksheet, the data becomes classified IAW this guidance.
       Preformatted worksheets should be clearly marked with instructions on classification.
       3.2.1.5. Classification Authority. As with SORTS, ART combines elements of the
       JOPES database with assessments of the ability of units to provide combat capability.
       The assessments are used in the Air Force war-planning effort as a readiness feed to the
       Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) which
       parallels SORTS and JOPES war-planning capability. The Joint Staff SORTS database is
       classified SECRET. Information extracted from this database is classified IAW, CJCSI
       3401.02 and must contain derivative classification markings consistent with EO 12958,
       except where authorized otherwise. Derivative classification rules apply when extracts
       contain exempted data. ART will follow this same rule set and classification guidance.
       3.2.1.6. Classification Marking. ART data or extracts are classified by this AFI. Mark
       documents or data ―Declassify on: (date). The date of declassification is 4 years from the
       date of the document for each level of classification. Declassification timeline is 4 years
       for CONFIDENTIAL, 8 years for SECRET.
 22                                         AFI10-244_AMCSUP_I 11 SEPTEMBER 2006


       3.2.1.7. Downgrading Authority. Initial downgrading of force readiness data and
       aggregate information will be determined by CJCS. HQ USAF/A3/5 is the authority to
       extend or accelerate downgrading classification of ART and SORTS data following an
       initial determination by CJCS.
3.3. What to Report. Commanders will report the unit’s current ability through the next six
months to support each allocated UTC. NOTE: ART uses an extract of the approved UTC/UIC
AEF assignment of forces in the UTC Availability. A-UTCs are not currently reported in ART.
ART is a source for AEF UTC/UIC alignment for the unit commander.
   3.3.1. Units reporting SORTS with UTCs allocated to an AEF or identified as an enabler
   shall continue to report SORTS IAW their Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statement
   and AFI 10-201, in addition to reporting in ART.
3.4. UTC Assessments. The assessments are based on the capability defined by the Mission
Capability Statement (MISCAP) to include manpower requirements and equipment detailed in
the Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging System (MEFPAK). The Logistic Force
Packaging Subsystem (LOGFOR) Logistics Detail (LOGDET) and Manpower Force Packaging
System (MANFOR) will be used to maintain the manpower and equipment requirements.
   3.4.1. Response Time. A UTC readiness assessment is based on resources that are expected
   to be mission ready and available within their DOC response time, (if the UTC is referenced
   in the unit’s DOC statement), or within 72 hours of tasking or less depending on the UTC
   requirements. A UTC is eligible to be tasked to perform its mission at any time.
   3.4.2. The Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP) provides a brief description of the
   capability for which the UTC is designed.
   3.4.3. The Logistic Force Packaging Subsystem (LOGFOR) provides a list of equipment the
   UTC requires to perform the mission.
   3.4.4. The Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) contains the manpower detail
   required to provide the capability for a standard UTC.
   3.4.5. Commanders provide an assessment of UTC readiness based on the unit's ability to
   provide the UTC for mission execution at any time.
   3.4.6. Commanders are not constrained by the unit SORTS "C" rating when assessing the
   health of the UTC.
   3.4.7. Commanders rate each UTC against the unit's current ability to deploy and employ
   the UTC. Areas to be considered are personnel, equipment, training, and equipment
   condition. Personnel must be worldwide mobility qualified and have all required mission and
   skill level training complete IAW applicable directives and instructions. Equipment must be
   serviceable and available for deployment.
       3.4.7.1. Equipment and supplies on hand reporting includes the status of LOGFOR
       equipment and supplies required to support the UTC. It may indicate budget and supply
       problems when details are known. Commanders determine the readiness status based on
       the availability of mission required equipment and supplies. Items are considered
       available if they are assigned to the unit and are physically present at the unit for
       deployment.
AFI10-244_AMCSUP_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 5 MAY 2010                                              23


         3.4.7.1.1. Units should report the status of UTCs as stand-alone requirements. For
         ―rainbowed‖ UTCs where a UTC has both personnel and equipment requirements,
         but shares the equipment with a sister organization already deployed, the UTC should
         be assessed as Red, since it does not currently have the required equipment prior to
         deployment. For a rainbowed UTC a comment should be entered to indicate the status
         of the shared equipment.
     3.4.7.2. The equipment condition area is used to determine the combat essential and
     support equipment that can be made ready within the UTC's response time to undertake
     the mission. Units assess the equipment condition for combat essential and support
     equipment based on the availability of required equipment.
         3.4.7.2.1. Units should report the status of UTCs as stand-alone requirements. For
         ―rainbowed‖ UTCs where a UTC has both personnel and equipment requirements,
         but shares the equipment with a sister organization already deployed, the UTC should
         be assessed as Red, since it does not currently have the required equipment prior to
         deployment. For a rainbowed UTC a comment should be entered to indicate the status
         of the shared equipment.
     3.4.7.3. The training assessment area indicates the status of training needed to support
     the mission for which a UTC is designed (MISCAP). All personnel assigned to a UTC
     must have all required mission and skill level training completed IAW applicable
     directives and instructions at the time of assessment. Individual training not required by
     the UTC (MISCAP or manpower detail) will not affect the readiness assessment but will
     be captured for deployment readiness tracking.
     3.4.7.4. DELETED
  3.4.8. Commanders are expected to use their judgment during assessments of missing or
  deficient capabilities (i.e. shortage of one computer may not make a UTC red; shortage of
  one generator may, similarly a member on a 72 hour medical profile would not require a
  UTC status change, whereas a person with a broken leg would). Remarks should reflect
  training requirements and/or resource actions necessary to improve the readiness status.
  3.4.9. In addition and independent of the stoplight (Green, Yellow, Red) assessment, each
  unit will indicate if a UTC is tasked to deploy and, if tasked, whether it can meet theater
  specific requirements including line remarks IAW timing criteria.
  3.4.10. AFI 10-403 Deployment Planning and Execution issues directives relating to
  personnel substitution. These directives apply for ART reporting purposes. For reporting
  purposes personnel substitutions reflected in the UTC MISCAP are authorized unless
  precluded in the deployment planning guidance.
  3.4.11. If a portion of a UTC is tasked to deploy, the remaining assets continue to be
  available for the entire deployment eligibility window. Commanders should indicate this in a
  remark.
  3.4.12. Commanders will continue to submit an overall UTC assessment that treats the
  deployed portion of that UTC as available and healthy unless circumstances/information
  warrants otherwise.
 24                                           AFI10-244_AMCSUP_I 11 SEPTEMBER 2006


3.5. Assess the overall health of a UTC. The UTC represents a capability that is assessed
using the category areas described in paragraph 3.4.7 The overall assessment is rated using the
following guidelines and the ART Monitor Assessment checklist maintained within ART (ART
Guidance under Information Tab).
   3.5.1. Green = Go. All MEFPAK (MANFOR, LOGFOR) identified personnel, equipment
   and training for the AEF allocated UTC are available for deployment within 72 hours of
   notification or sooner if subject to more stringent criteria. NOTE: UTC MISCAP or
   applicable DOC statement response times may be more stringent.
   3.5.1. (AMC) If a UTC is coded ―Green‖ and cannot meet all or part of its MISCAP during
   an IG inspection, UTC will receive an ―Unsatisfactory‖ or ―Marginal‖ grade. The affected
   unit will change the UTC’s ART status to reflect the correct assessment (yellow or red) and
   provide the rationale for not being green with an associated Get Well Date. HQ AMC/IG will
   forward the "Yellow" or "Red" UTCs to the applicable MAJCOM FAM(s) and courtesy copy
   AMC/A3OCR to ensure accurate ART reporting. Once corrective actions have been
   completed and the Wing/CC or equivalent determines the UTC can meet its full MISCAP,
   unit will return the UTC ART status to ―Green.‖
   3.5.2. Yellow = Caution. The UTC has a missing or deficient capability; but that missing or
   deficient capability does not prevent the UTC from being tasked and accomplishing its
   mission in a contingency and/or AEF rotation. Provide a detailed explanation of the shortfall
   in remarks. Describe the shortfall, the corrective action and provide a projected get-well date.
   3.5.3. Red = No Go. The UTC has a missing or deficient capability that prevents the UTC
   from being tasked and accomplishing its mission in a contingency and/or AEF rotation.
   Provide detailed explanation of the shortfall in remarks. Describe the shortfall, the corrective
   action and provide a get-well date.
   3.5.3. (AMC) Red = No Go. The UTC has a missing or deficient capability that prevents the
   UTC from being tasked and accomplishing its mission in a contingency and/or AEF rotation
   based on the UTC MISCAP statement. However, residual capability with the UTC may still
   be capable of supporting its theater specific tasking.
   3.5.4. Note: when the database is updated, an automated e-mail will be sent to the
   appropriate MAJCOM approved account holder indicating UTC(s) having a change. The
   owning organization is required to confirm that the UTC assessment is unchanged or to
   revise it as necessary.
   3.5.5. Think of the monthly assessment as a Yes/No process (Figure 3.1). Additionally, a
   Yes/No process can be used when assessing if a UTC is tasked to deploy and if it can meet
   theater specific requirements (Figure 3.2).
AFI10-244_AMCSUP_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 5 MAY 2010                                           25


Figure 3.1. Monthly Assessment Process.




3.6. Tasked to Deploy Assessment. Upon deployment notification, commanders owning
UTC’s tasked to deploy, in whole or in part, are required to assess the UTCs ability to meet
theater specific requirements to include line remarks. Each unit commander’s UTC tasking
assessment is the Air Force’s certification of forces. This assessment is independent of the
overall UTC stoplight assessment. As an example, a UTC may not have a person with specific
skill level and experience required by line remarks, however the UTC status (Green, Yellow,
Red) does not change since the stoplight assessment is based on the UTCs ability to deploy
anywhere in the world at the time of the assessment. Another example is a Red UTC assessment
due to equipment which could be tasked to support a personnel only theater requirement. Even
though it can meet that specific deployment tasking, the overall status is still Red.
   3.6.1. A Yes/No process can be used when assessing if a UTC is tasked to deploy and if it
   can meet theater specific requirements (Figure 3.2).
 26                                             AFI10-244_AMCSUP_I 11 SEPTEMBER 2006


Figure 3.2. Tasked to Deploy Assessment Process.




   3.6.2. (Added-AMC) When a UTC is partially tasked and the unit can meet the theater
   requirements, mark tasked line numbers within the UTC as ―Tasked – Yes‖, and mark ―Yes‖
   or ―No‖ whether the line number is deployed. Then identify that the UTC can meet its
   tasking, (e.g., ―CanMeet – Yes‖). Overall UTC assessment does not change when partially
   tasked.
   3.6.3. (Added-AMC) When indicating ―Meets – No‖ outline the planned action (i.e. waiver
   requested, training scheduled, or shortfall to be submitted) in the tasked remark area. Units
   will continually update the tasked remark area with the status of the waiver request or
   Reclama until final disposition.
       3.6.3.1. (Added-AMC) ART must be updated immediately with concise information
       identifying: The shortfall condition (i.e. condition 1 – 5), Shortfall justification to include
       authorized and assigned personnel, and ability to fulfill any other AFSC or equipment
       requirements.
3.7. Remarks. Plain language supplemental remarks are a critical component of the ART report
and are used as a management tool. Remarks are required if a unit is less than fully capable in
any reportable area. Remarks are used to identify trends and to redirect resources if necessary.
Remarks are mandatory for UTCs assessed Yellow and Red. All status remarks will be
standardized remarks from Standard Assessment Remarks listing maintained within ART (ART
Guidance under Information Tab) only. However, the Commander’s Remarks section is an
additional avenue that should be utilized to relay vital information that affects the readiness or
AFI10-244_AMCSUP_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 5 MAY 2010                                                  27


availability of the UTC. This area of ART can be utilized regardless of the readiness status of the
UTC (i.e., Green, Yellow, or Red).
3.7. (AMC)Remarks. Unit ART Monitors must provide rank, last name, and Defense Switched
Network (DSN) number when entering free text remarks on any of the Remark Fields as its last
line. For example: ―SSgt Kline at DSN: (312)779-2323.‖
   3.7.1. Commanders use the remarks and associated get-well-dates (GWD) to explain and
   amplify data contained in ART reports. Write remarks in plain text English and ensure they
   contain all appropriate details such as AFSCs, projected improvements, workarounds, etc.
   Remarks should be sufficient to allow responsible managers to take specific corrective
   action. The remarks sections are not size limited.
   3.7.2. As applicable, list resource types with associated deficiencies; state numbers required,
   assigned, and available; explain the cause of the problem, if known; identify previously
   requested assistance; identify remedial actions in progress, highlight further actions required,
   and provide a projection of when the readiness status will change.
   3.7.3. Air Force standard abbreviations are acceptable. However, non-common, unique, or
   unit/system/functional specific acronyms will be defined when first used in a report. Do not
   refer to previous reports (ART is dynamic and will not retain previous remarks).
   3.7.4. Wing Commanders should challenge inadequate remarks. MAJCOMs will sample,
   review, and assess adequacy of unit remarks.
3.8. When to Report. All Air Force and Air Force gained units will submit and update UTC
assessments every 30 calendar days. ―E‖-suffix UTCs, which identifies D-UTCs that are
chronically empty, will be assessed once as red and will not require an update until the ―E‖-
suffix is removed. The Air Force goal for on-time reporting is 97%.
3.8. (AMC)When to Report. All AMC and AMC gained units (upon activation under Title 10)
will submit and update the overall UTC health assessments every 30 calendar days but not later
than the 25th of each month. Dates that fall on a weekend or holiday will be adjusted to the duty
day prior.
   3.8.1. Upon notification of a significant event that changes the assessment of a UTC for the
   current plus two AEF rotations (i.e.: AEF 1/2 + AEF 3/4 & 5/6), the unit commander will
   submit an out-of-cycle report within 24 hours of the change. This includes notification of a
   UTC change or addition.
   3.8.2. Additionally, commanders owning UTC's tasked to deploy will submit via ART an
   assessment of their ability to support the tasking, including theater specific requirements,
   within five (5) days of receipt of a deployment notification.
   3.8.3. Units owning a UTC tasked to deploy will reset the deployment status from "Yes" to
   "No" not later than five (5) calendar days after the tasked resources return to home station.
3.9. Where to Report. ART is accessed from the AFPC/DPW homepage located at the
following URL https://aefcenter.afpc.randolph.af.smil.mil/. Click on the ―AEF UTC
Reporting Tool‖ link. Users are required to have SIPRNET access in order to submit ART
updates.

Terms
AEF (Air and Space Expeditionary Force)—Is the Air Force’s methodology for organizing,
training, equipping and sustaining rapidly responsive air and space forces to meet defense
strategy requirements. Through the AEF, the Air Force supports defense strategy requirements
using a combination of both permanently assigned and rotational (allocated) forces.
AEF Library—A collection of 13 Time Phased Force Deployment Data sets (TPFDDs) in Joint
Operations Planning and Execution system (JOPES) that list the Air Force’s available Unit Type
Codes (UTCs) (UTC/UIC combinations) for a specific Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF),
Aerospace Expeditionary Wing (AEW), and Enabler Forces.
Aerospace Expeditionary Group—an independent group assigned or attached to an aerospace
expeditionary task force (AETF) or an in-place NAF by MAJCOM G-series orders. Normally,
the aerospace expeditionary task force (AETF) or in-place NAF commander also exercises
Operational Control (OPCON) of AEGs. An AEG is composed of the group command element
 32                                            AFI10-244_AMCSUP_I 11 SEPTEMBER 2006


and one or more squadrons. The AEG, depending on the size and structure of the AEF, is the
lowest command echelon of AEFs that may report directly to a COMAFFOR. Also called AEG.
Aerospace Expeditionary Task Force—A deployed numbered air force (NAF) or command
echelon immediately subordinate to a NAF provided as the US Air Force component command
to a joint operation. Also called AETF. See also air expeditionary force; air expeditionary
wing.
Aerospace Expeditionary Wing—An Aerospace Expeditionary Wing (AEW) is a wing or a
wing slice assigned or attached to an Aerospace Expeditionary Task Force (AETF) or an in-place
Numbered Air Force (NAF) by MAJCOM G-series orders. Normally, the AETF or in-place NAF
commander also exercises Operational Control (OPCON) of AEWs. An AEW is composed of
the wing command element and some groups. The AEW commander reports to a Commander
Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR). Also called AEW.
Alert Status—A posture, initiated by a Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Alert Order, in
which designated units prepare their personnel and equipment for rapid deployment upon
receiving tasking.
Allocation—Distribution of limited resources among competing requirements for employment.
Resources Unit Type Codes (UTCs) made available to an AEF.
Apportion (Planning)—The resource made available to the commander of a unified command
for contingency planning. Apportioned resources are used in the development of operations plans
and may be more or less than those allocated for execution planning or actual execution.
Available Line Number—A Unit Type Code (UTC) tasked to a unit identification code (UIC)
and registered in the UTA as a UTC/UIC combination. When a unit has the required personnel
and equipment available, units may be tasked to provide multiple instances of the same UTC
combination. A unique record number in the UTA identifies the additional instances of the
UTC/UIC.
Command and Control—(DOD)—The exercise of authority and direction by a properly
designated commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission.
Command and control functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment,
communications, facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing,
coordinating, and controlling forces and operations in the accomplishment of the mission. Also
called C2. (JP 1-02)
Deployment—The movement of forces within operational areas. The positioning of forces into a
formation for battle. The relocation of forces and materiel to desired operational areas.
Deployment encompasses all activities from origin or home station through destination,
specifically including intra-continental United States, intertheater and intratheater movement legs
staging and holding areas. See also deployment order; deployment planning; deployment
preparation order. JP 1-02.
Deployed—These resources are not currently at home station by reason of execution of a
properly authorized movement order or Joint deployment order. Additionally, not recallable by a
commander's Leave and TDY recall message. Normally, deployment in support of training
exercises or Joint exercises would not preclude recall or release of forces by the exercising
commander.
AFI10-244_AMCSUP_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 5 MAY 2010                                                 33


Direct Liaison Authorized—That authority granted by a commander (any level) to a
subordinate to directly consult or coordinate an action with a command or agency within or
outside of the granting command. Direct liaison authorized is more applicable to planning than
operations and always carries with it the requirement of keeping the commander granting direct
liaison authorized informed. Direct liaison authorized is a coordination relationship, not an
authority through which command may be exercised. Also called DIRLAUTH (Joint Pub 1-02)
Designed Operational Capability—A summary of a unit’s mission and resources for which it
has been organized, designed, and equipped used to aid in reporting in Status of Resources and
Training Systems (SORTS). Also called DOC (AFI 10-201).
Expeditionary Combat Support—Tailored Agile Combat Support (ACS) capability deployed
to expeditionary sites to provide for Aerospace Expeditionary Forces (AEFs) employed in global
engagement operations. This capability is produced by rapidly deployable, tailored forces
executing ACS processes to beddown, employ, maintain, protect, and redeploy tactical
components of aerospace power and production.
Equipment—In logistics, all non-expendable items needed to outfit or equip an individual or
organization.
Equipment Condition—The status of an item of equipment in the possession of an operating
unit that indicates it is capable of fulfilling its intended mission and in a system configuration
that offers a high assurance of an effective, reliable, and safe performance.
Functional Area Manager—The individual responsible for the management and planning of all
personnel and equipment within a specific functional area to support wartime and peacetime
contingencies.
Force Module Package—A force module with a specific functional orientation (e.g. air
superiority, close air support, reconnaissance, ground defense) that include combat, associated
combat support, and combat service support forces. Additionally, for module packages will
contain sustainment in accordance with logistic policy contained in Joint Strategic Capabilities
Plan Annex B. Also called FMP. See also force module.
Force Package A—Force Package is the basic unit designator of a unit type code (UTC) and is
used as a planning tool to tailor an Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF).
Global Military force Policy—CJCS policy that determines Air Force ability to provide full
distribution of Command and Control (C2), Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR),
and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) assets. Also called GMFP
LS/HD (Limited Supply/High Demand)—Limited assets/forces with unique mission
capabilities stressed by continual high Operations TEMPO (OPTEMPO) because of CCDR
requirements. Often referred to as forces assigned to the Global Military Force Policy (GMFP).
Lead Unit—MAJCOMs will designate a lead unit when the forces placed on call come from
more than one location. The Lead Unit works closely with the parent MAJCOM who directs the
planning and coordination efforts of designated Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF) units to
determine operational, logistics, and support requirements to meet mission objectives.
Limiting Factor (DOD)—A factor or condition that, either temporarily or permanently impedes
mission accomplishment. Illustrative examples are transportation network deficiencies, lack of
 34                                             AFI10-244_AMCSUP_I 11 SEPTEMBER 2006


in-place facilities, malpositioned forces or materiel, extreme climatic conditions, distance, transit
or overflight rights, political conditions, etc. (JP 1-02)
Logistics Detail—The specific material identified for deployment within the Unit Type Code
(UTC). Also called LOGDET
Logistic Force Packaging Subsystem—This MEFPAK component that contains Unit Type
Code (UTC) Logistics Detail (LOGDET) data and serves as a database for Operational Plan
(OPLAN) development and execution. Also called LOGFOR
Manpower Force Packaging System—The Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging System
(MEFPAK) component that provides: The title of the unit or force element and its unique Joint
Chiefs of Staff unit type code. The manpower detail by function, grade (officers only), quantity
and Air Force specialty code required to meet the defined capability. Also called MANFOR.
Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging System—A data system designed to support
contingency and general war planning with predefined standardized manpower and equipment
force packages. MEFPAK, which operates in the command and control environment, is
composed of two subsystems: the Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) and the
Logistics Force Packaging System (LOGFOR). Also called MEFPAK
Mission Capability Statement—A short paragraph associated with each Unit Type Code (UTC)
that describes significant employment information, briefly explains mission capability, the types
of bases to which a UTC can be deployed, and all pertinent personnel substitution rules (i.e., bare
base, standby deployment base, or limited operating base). Also called MISCAP
Noncombatant Evacuation Operations—(DOD)—Operations directed by the Department of
State, the Department of Defense, or other appropriate authority whereby noncombatants are
evacuated from foreign countries when their lives are endangered by war, civil unrest, or natural
disaster to safe havens or to the United States. Also called NEOs. Also called NEO (JP 1-02)
On Call Status—A posture assumed by units designated by MAJCOMs allowing units to
rapidly transition from normal day-to-day operations to Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEF)
operations. This posture is established before receipt of a Chairman Joint Chief of Staff (CJCS)
Alert Order.
Personnel Reclama—When a wing/tasked unit/installation cannot meet an individual
augmentee tasking, they will request relief by submitting a personnel reclama through the local
manpower and military personnel flight to their parent MAJCOM personnel readiness office.
Positioning—Positioning refers to movements that take place after receipt of a Warning/Alert
Order but prior to the Execute Order. Positioning normally refers to aircraft, aircrews, and
Mobility Support Teams (MSTs).
Pre—Position—To place military units, equipment, or supplies at or near the point of planned
use or at a designated location to reduce reaction time, and to ensure timely support of a specific
force during initial phases of an operation. Exception: The HQ AMC Tanker Airlift Control
Center (TACC) commander may (pre) position air refueling forces (aircraft and crews) in
anticipation of a Warning/Alert Order. Depending on the nature of the contingency, this will
facilitate the timely movement of other positioning/deploying forces.
Rainbowed Equipment—Non-prepositioned equipment that is sourced from multiple units, left
in place, and utilized by multiple units/UTCs over time to enable the best support of vulnerable

Aerospace Expeditionary Force (AEFs) while minimizing home station impact on supporting
units (Equipment working group, Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS) Conference).
Status—A stoplight Commander's assessment reporting the degree to which a Unit Type Code
(UTC) meets its designed capability.
Tasked to Deploy—The owing unit has received an order/directive to actually deploy the Unit
Type Code (UTC) in whole or in part (approximately 120 days out for steady state
commitments). This is different from a UTC being allocated to an Aerospace Expeditionary
Force (AEF) or entering its primary vulnerability period for deployment.
Time—phased force and deployment data—The Joint Operation Planning and Execution
System (JOPES) data base portion of an operation plan (OPLAN); it contains time-phased force
data, non-unit-related cargo and personnel data, and movement data for the operational plan,
including: (a) in-place units, (b) units to be deployed to support the operation plan with a priority
indicating the desired sequence for their arrival at the port of debarkation, (c) routing of forces to
be deployed, (d) movement data associated with deploying forces, (e) estimates of non-unit-
related cargo and personnel movements to be conducted concurrently with the deployment of
forces, and (f) estimate of transportation requirements that must be fulfilled by common-user lift
resources as well as those requirements that can be fulfilled by assigned or attached
transportation resources. Also called TPFDD (JP 1-02)
UTC Shortfall—When a wing/tasked installation does not possess sufficient qualified personnel
or equipment to support a Unit Type Code (UTC) tasking, they request relief by submitting a
UTC shortfall request from the installation deployment office to their MAJCOM operation plans
or deployment office. For personnel, this request will be coordinated as a minimum with the
local manpower office and MPF. There are two types of personnel UTC shortfalls: 1) a
wing/installation cannot support the entire UTC; and 2) a wing/installation can support part of
the tasked UTC, but cannot fill one or more of the Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC)
requirements within the UTC.

                                PROCEDURES OVERVIEW

A4.1. Using ART. ART is a web-based application that uses active server pages (.ASP). All
inputs to the web site are processed immediately and archived to a database resident at the
AEFC. Users must be aware all updates are "Real Time". All users must be appointed by their
respective MAJCOMS prior to updating the status of UTCs. MAJCOMs will forward all
appointed users names in a format provided by the AEFC. Upon receipt of user data the AEFC
will pre-populate the ART database with this information to ensure immediate access by
authorized users. An online tutorial is provided upon initial login and users are encouraged to
review and understand the tutorial prior to establishing a user profile in ART. Review of the
tutorial will provide a better understanding of the procedures required to submit reports. Users
should review the on-line procedures contained on the AEF website for the latest updates to
these procedures.
   A4.1.1. Reporting on a UTC.
       A4.1.1.1. Once appointed, users will create a user profile in ART. This profile can be
       edited and deleted at any time. MAJCOM's will notify the AEFC when user profiles are
       no longer valid or active. ART will generate a userid, the user will be required to provide
       a password. Upon verification users will be required to create a profile
           A4.1.1.1.1. Creating a user profile: once entered on the access list, the user must
           create a profile of the units that will be updated. Click on new user. After looking
           over the tutorial click next. Enter your first and last name and submit. A data base
           search will occur to ensure the submitted name is authorized to proceed. Your user
           information submitted by your MAJCOM will be displayed to ensure all data is
           correct and/or to make necessary changes. Changes should be sent via SIPRNET e-
           mail. There is no reference to Numbered Air Force (NAF) in the TPFDD library. To
           get this data into ART the system associates the NAF in the user’s profile with the
           UTC being updated. If a person enters an incorrect NAF or a UTC is not updated, the
           NAF selection will not locate all the UTCs for that NAF. A screen will display all
           bases units listed in the TPFDD library. Select the applicable base(s) (holding down
           the control key will allow selecting more than one base), and click submit. A screen
           will display and allow unit selection of one base at a time (holding down the control
           key will allow selecting more than one unit at a time. (Clicking the first unit and
           holding down the shift key and scrolling to the bottom then clicking on the last will
           select all). When all the appropriate units are selected, submit. Enter your password
           (Air Force standard: 8 characters, at least one upper case, one lower case, one special
           character and one number), submit. The final window will appear and display your
           userid/login. Please make sure to note the login.
       A4.1.1.2. Select base (if required), unit and AEF that will be updated. All UTCs for this
       combination will display.
       A4.1.1.3. 30-day assessment: Select the appropriate status, i.e., Green, Red or Yellow. If
       reporting other then green, a detailed remark describing the deficiency is mandatory. Get-
       well-data is a mandatory field. If a get-well-date is not known provide your best estimate.
       If your UTC is "Green" you cannot submit remarks.

     A4.1.1.4. Tasked-to-deploy assessment. The tasked-to-deploy assessment is totally
     separate from the 30 day UTC assessment (green, yellow, red). The "UTC is Tasked to
     Deploy" selection defaults to "No".
         A4.1.1.4.1. Upon receipt of deployment notification (approximately 120 out days for
         steady state commitments) select "Yes". This will activate the "Can Meet Theater
         Specific Requirements" selection.
         A4.1.1.4.2. "Can Meet Theater Specific Requirements." If the UTC can meet
         additional tasking levied by the theater (such as specific training or line remarks) or
         there is no additional theater requirement click "Yes". If the UTC cannot support the
         tasking due to the theater specific requirement then check "No". The text box will
         activate and the discrepancy is entered (i.e. Do not have a 7 level with 14 years).
         A4.1.1.4.3. Upon return to home station/reconstitution check "No" under "UTC is
         Tasked to Deploy".
  A4.1.2. Generating a Report.
     A4.1.2.1. The "Reports" button on the ART Homepage gives access to the "UTC Reports
     Selection".
     A4.1.2.2. The "UTC Reports Selection" is divided into two parts. The upper box controls
     what data is pulled and the lower box controls what is displayed.
         A4.1.2.2.1. You must select at least one area in each the upper and lower box.
     A4.1.2.3. You can display the data in one of three formats: a display to screen, an Excel
     spreadsheet, or a basic number count.
     A4.1.2.4. Note: A user profile is not required in order to access and generate a report.

Supplies and Equipment Condition (PTEC) monthly in ART. ALWAYS consider what the UTC's                             Months
MISCAP states when assessing. Use only standard comments from AEFC approved list.

GREEN = There are absolutely NO UTC deficiencies in any of the four assessed areas               G             G
YELLOW = UTC can meet MISCAP but there are deficiencies to be noted                                   Y                 Y
RED = UTC cannot meet MISCAP due to too many deficiencies                                                  R                R
BLACK = UTC is postured in the wrong AEF and requires MAJCOM FAM attention. No
assessment is required for incorrectly postured UTCs.
The lowest rating in any area will drive the overall rating of the UTC. Any deficiencies must
have remarks and Get Well Dates (GWD); check each month for expiration.
Refer to the MISCAP, MANFOR, LOGFOR, MILPDS, AFI 10-244 (Ch 3), AFI 10-401 and AFI
10-403.
