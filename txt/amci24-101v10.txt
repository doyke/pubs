4. Aircraft Supply Issue.
   4.1. Fleet service issues supplies to all originating and transiting aircraft, as required. The
   primary supplies required for issue to transport aircraft are listed in Attachment 2.
   Requisition those supply items shown to have a historical need to accomplish the unit
   mission. Additional supplies are authorized, as required, by type mission and operational
   directives.
   4.2. AMC tanker aircraft will carry passenger comfort kits (assigned at home station), with
   blankets, and pillows. Exchange clean blankets and pillows for soiled blankets and pillows
   on a one-for-one basis to maintain initial stock level.
   4.3. To ensure aircraft are fully outfitted at originating and en route stations, the fleet supply
   section will establish a 30-45 day stock level for expendable items listed in Attachment 2
   through appropriate supply channels. The fleet supply section must inventory the stock level
   to reorder necessary items to prevent stock levels from falling below a 30-day supply level.
   4.4. The fleet service manager will review inventories and consumption data monthly and
   adjust stock levels as required.
   4.5. Supplies should be prepackaged to provide the correct amount and type of supplies and
   expedite fleeting. Prepacking into aircraft loads should be accomplished for the most
   common aircraft configuration originating/transiting your station. Reference AFI 11-2C-5,
   Vol. 3, Addendum A; AFI 11-2C-17, Vol. 3, Addendum A; AFI 11-2VIP, Vol. 3; AFI 11-
   2C-130, Vol. 3, Addendum A and C- C-130J Concept of Operations Annex C, Addendum A.
5. Non-AMC Aircraft Equipment and Supply Issues.
   5.1. On request, fleet service personnel will issue expendable supplies and equipment to
   non-AMC aircraft based on mission requirements.
       5.1.1. Units may use the AF Form 4128 or AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt for
       Issued Items, or locally produced form to issue supplies to home station/non-AMC
       aircraft.
       5.1.2. Units will use the AF Form 1297 for all in-transit aircraft.
   5.2. For local training missions, units may use either AF Form 4128 or AF Form 1297 to
   control and account for fleet equipment items. EXCEPTION: If these aircraft are carrying
   Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF) passengers/cargo, and items are requested,
   then prepare in duplicate, an AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt for Issued Items.
   Legibly print the name, organization, mission/tail number, and home station of the individual
   signing for the equipment. If available, attach a copy of the crew orders. NOTE: Do not
   loan the Electric 2-gallon Insulated Metal Jugs.
       5.2.1. If the aircraft mission will terminate at an AMC aerial port, furnish ATOC with
       the quantity of items to be removed from the aircraft and returned to the issuing station,
       for inclusion in the remarks section of the Mission Load Report.
       5.2.2. If the aircraft mission will terminate at a non-AMC station, dispatch a message to
       the aircrew's home organization indicating the aircraft tail number and the name of the
       individual who signed for the items and request the return of the items to the nearest
       AMC station.
AMCI24-101V10 30 AUGUST 2012                                                                       11


   5.3. On request, each non-AMC aircraft will be jointly inventoried upon arrival or departure
   by fleet service personnel and the aircraft commander's designated representative to
   determine the type and amount of equipment onboard. Document equipment on an AF Form
   1297 in two copies, give one copy to the responsible crew member and maintain the second
   copy in fleet service station file.
6. Procedures for Issuing, Controlling, and Accounting for Air Transportable
Galley/Lavatory (ATGLs), Portable Lavatory Units, Portable Urinals, and Associated
Equipment.
   6.1. Controlling, accounting for, and reporting of aircraft passenger configuration assets is
   essential in providing the highest standard of service for our airlift customers. Air
   transportation (fleet service section) monitors, controls, and accounts for these assets. Close
   coordination between aircraft maintenance, ATOC, and fleet service is necessary to ensure
   proper use of these assets.
   6.2. Day-to-day management and redistribution of these assets will reside at the squadron
   level.
   6.3. ATGLs are distributed according to mission requirements. Coordinate long-term or
   permanent redistribution with HQ AMC/A4TP for approval prior to pallet movement.
   6.4. Issue equipment for the ATGLs/portable unit using AMC Form 12-1, Comfort
   Pallet/Portable Lavatory Unit Checklist. Prepare sufficient copies of AMC Form 12-1 to
   enable each en route station to retain a copy. The original copy of AMC Form 12-1,
   prepared by the home station, will accompany the ATGL/portable lavatory throughout its
   entire mission. Complete AMC Form 12-1 using the same procedures for AF Form 4128.
      6.4.1. When mission requirements dictate that an ATGL be downloaded at an en route or
      terminating station, the gaining station must contact and report action to the owning base
      listed on the ATGL. The ATGL will deteriorate without proper servicing and
      maintenance. Every effort must be made to return the ATGL back to the assigned station
      as soon as possible.
7. Equipment Control (AF Form 4128).
   7.1. Issue aircraft equipment using AF Form 4128 prepared in sufficient copies for each
   station. The original copy of AF Form 4128 will accompany the aircraft throughout its entire
   mission. Complete this form, as follows:
      7.1.1. Home station.
          7.1.1.1. Enter the three-letter station code designator and actual quantity of each fleet
          service item placed aboard the aircraft in the appropriate blocks in Parts I and II.
          7.1.1.2. Add any items peculiar to that station or flight in the blank space provided.
          7.1.1.3. After the inventory is accomplished by a fleet service and aircrew
          representative, retain a copy in the home station file. The fleet service and aircrew
          representative will sign the appropriate block in Part I to validate/verify that non-
          expendable items have been placed aboard the aircraft.
          7.1.1.4. Local training missions returning to Home Station on the same day of
          departure, do not require an AF Form 4128.
 12                                                         AMCI24-101V10 30 AUGUST 2012


       7.1.2. En route station.
           7.1.2.1. Use AF Form 4128 to inventory the aircraft and to account for required
           equipment. If no AF Form 4128 is onboard, initiate one at your station and annotate
           “no original” in block one of Sections 1 and 2.
           7.1.2.2. Return the original copy to the aircraft prior to departure.
       7.1.3. Offshore stations functioning as originating station.
           7.1.3.1. Remove the original copy of AF Form 4128 from the aircraft and maintain in
           the mission folder until the aircraft departs to its home station.
           7.1.3.2. Prepare a new AF Form 4128 as described in paragraph 7.1.1 above.
           7.1.3.3. When the aircraft prepares to return to home station, use AF Form 4128
           which was described in paragraph 7.1.3.1
   7.2. The aircraft commander or designated representative is responsible for inventorying the
   fleet service equipment onboard and ensuring adequate quantities of supplies and equipment
   have been placed onboard.
   7.3. If an inventory change occurs at en route stations, annotate Part III of AF Form 4128
   and enter the type and amount of equipment added or removed and the reason on AMC Form
   244.
       7.3.1. For en route stations without an established inventory of expendables and/or non-
       expendable’s, the AF Form 4128 will be annotated IAW paragraph 7.5.1 below and
       replacement items will not be issued. Broken items will not be removed but will
       accompany the aircraft to the first station capable of replacing the item(s).
   7.4. Equipment may be transferred between two AMC aircraft using AF Form 4128,
   prepared in duplicate. Attach a copy of AF Form 4128 from the aircraft transferring the
   equipment to the original. The aircraft commander or designated representative on the
   aircraft transferring the equipment retains the original AF Form 4128 and returns it to the
   originating station.
   7.5. When conducting an inventory and an item is missing or lost, complete Part IV of the
   AF Form 4128. This verifies that an inventory has been conducted, the item is not on the
   aircraft, and the station conducting the inventory is not responsible for finding it.
       7.5.1. Provide as much information as possible on missing/lost items: amount, previous
       station where accounted for, date, fleet service personnel signature, and a brief statement
       detailing known issues on missing/lost item.
8. Fleet Service Inventory. Inventory expendable/nonexpendable equipment using AMC Form
249, Fleet Service Equipment Record, a locally produced version or computerized version,
prepared as shown in Attachment 3. The fleet service manager may review the report and take
action to adjust discrepancies, return loaned equipment to/from their station, and ensure timely
return of items in maintenance. As a minimum, the report should include regulated items listed
in Attachment 4, plus any regulated items unique to a specific station (i.e., tablecloths, napkins,
etc.).
AMCI24-101V10 30 AUGUST 2012                                                              13

10. Air Transportable Galley/Lavatory (ATGL)/Portable Lavatory Unit.
   10.1. The fleet service manager is responsible for control and accountability of ATGLs and
   portable lavatory units. Report ATGLs weekly using AMC-A4T 8001 report via established
   web based program to HQ AMC/A4TR NLT COB every Tuesday or as required by HQ
   AMC. Units unable to access the report via the web must submit their reports via email to
   HQ AMC/A4TR and 618 AOC/XOPM organizational boxes until the web based system is
   available. Coordinate with your unit OPR of the report to ensure timely submission. Fleet
   service personnel will ensure ATOC has the owning station three-letter code and 5-digit
   ATGL registration number (i.e., AF127) for inclusion on the Mission Load Report.
   Responsibility for ensuring the continued serviceability of the ATGLs/portable lavatories is
   shared among fleet service, maintenance, and aircrew personnel.
      10.1.1. ATGLs will be sent via military air as much as possible. If transported by truck,
      fleet service personnel are responsible for ensuring the trucking company has been
      provided proper shipping information and requirements. ATGLs must be shipped using
      an air-ride type trailer and tie down is applied thru tine holes and not over the top of the
      ATGL. The ATGL must have an additional tarp over the top of the existing ATGL cover
      while in surface transport mode. This tarp must be secured with bungee cord to prevent
      damage to the tarp and unit.
   10.2. Air Transportable Galley/Lavatory. The ATGL provides electrical and water systems
   for galley and latrine services.
      10.2.1. Installation/removal. Do not release rail system locks until the vent hose, oxygen
      hose, and cannon plug are disconnected and aerial port personnel are prepared to offload
      the unit. NOTE: Only qualified maintenance personnel may connect/disconnect the vent
      hose, oxygen hose, and cannon plug.
      10.2.2. Fleet service will perform pre/post-flight inspection requirements, post load
      operational checks if power is available, and oven/refrigerator temperature checks IAW

       18.2.1. There is the possibility of disease transmission by contact with human waste
       while servicing aircraft latrines. Some waste material usually vents to the ground when
       connecting and disconnecting the drainage system. Such material can become airborne in
       gusty wind conditions and contaminate those personnel servicing the aircraft.
       18.2.2. To reduce this possibility, fleet service personnel will comply with the following
       procedures:
           18.2.2.1. Use extreme caution when opening the lavatory servicing panel to avoid
           accidental contamination by discharged waste due to missing or faulty plug
           assembly/doughnut.
           18.2.2.2. During aircraft latrine servicing operations, personnel will adhere to
           personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements as outlined in AFI 91-203, Chapter
           14. Note: “Workplace supervisors shall contact Bioenvironmental Engineering to
           determine the appropriate PPE for all processes.”      Fleet service personnel are
           authorized to wear the blue or green coverall in performance of their duties. See
           Allowance Standard 758 for basis of issue.
           18.2.2.3. Seek medical treatment if signs or symptoms appear caused from personnel
           receiving cuts or scratches while servicing aircraft latrines.
           18.2.2.4. Personnel in direct contact with waste matter from any source will wash
           immediately and change clothes.
           18.2.2.5. Close cooperation will be maintained between supervisory personnel and
           medical services/bioenvironmental personnel on all problems concerning sanitation
           and industrial health.

      of servicing unit. (Furnish deicer/anti-ice solution mix of approximately 50/50
      deicer/anti-ice to water). The contractor is responsible for providing additional antifreeze
      solution should individual contractor operating specialist require a stronger mix. This is
      done subsequent to the completion of government-furnished lavatory servicing.
      EXCEPTION: At joint-use airfields when the contractor terminates a commercial or
      military mission and parks the aircraft on the civilian side allowing adequate time to
      accomplish commercial fleet servicing, then later positions the aircraft for an AMC
      mission requiring lavatory servicing, the carrier will reimburse AMC.
