       (Attachment 15) when establishing an AED site.
       1.8.2. At a minimum be trained in Heartsaver CPR/AED and appointed in writing by
       their unit or civilian equivalent (Attachment 12). A copy of the appointment memo or
       other written appointment documentation will be forwarded to the Installation PAD
       Coordinator who will maintain these on record. In addition, the POC will place the
       appointment memo in the AED binder. The POC will maintain current Heartsaver
       CPR/AED certification and provide a copy of certifications to the Installation PAD
       Program Coordinator.

           according to the manufacturer’s manual. Daily and weekly operational checks are
           required using the manufacturer’s AED functional operations checklist, these must be
           annotated on a daily log. (Attachment 13).
           1.8.3.3. All monthly report logs are forwarded to the Organization PAD Coordinator
           by the seventh day of the following month. If the AED report logs are not received by
           the seventh day, the Organization Program Coordinator will be notified and required
           to follow up with the AED POCs for that specific AED to get the missing information
           and forward it to the Installation PAD Program Coordinator as soon as possible. If no
           data is received by the Installation PAD Program Coordinator within 30 days
           following the end of the month, then the unit commander or civilian equivalent will
           be notified.
       1.8.4. Will restock AED supplies after use in an emergency situation.
       1.8.5. Ensure a core group of the organization's members are trained, certified, and/or
       recertified in CPR/AED use and can respond to an event. Certified training is available
       through the American Heart Association or the American Red Cross.
       1.8.6. Conduct and document quarterly CPR/AED exercise scenarios to ensure trained
       staff know AED locations, equipment is operational, and staff responds appropriately
       (Attachment 14). If the AED POC needs additional guidance, contact the installation
       PAD Coordinator or PAD Medical Director as the local resource.
       1.8.7. Will train a Core Group (Targeted Responders) to follow the protocol in an
       emergency situation as depicted in the AED Treatment Algorithm (Attachment 16).
       1.8.8. Will install AED location signage at all locations and post information signs along
       with an AED photo within the facility to readily identify location of all AEDs

EDWARDSAFBI10-301 3 APRIL 2014                                                                    7


      1.8.9. Will arrange for Traumatic Stress Response (TSR) debriefing sessions
      (Attachment 8) to be offered to individuals involved in providing assistance in an
      emergency situation as needed.
2. Steps to Take If The AED Is Used In A Real Situation.
   2.1. The Site Coordinator or the individual using the AED on a victim will complete the
   AED Coordinated Report for Medical Director (Attachment 18) and forward it to the
   Medical Director, within one duty day AED-use event for immediate review.
   2.2. The AED POC will take the used AED to Biomedical Equipment Repair as soon as
   possible for evaluation and downloading of data. The POC will call Biomedical Equipment
   Repair at 661-275-2674 prior to their arrival.
   2.3. Quality Assurance. The PAD Medical Director or designee will review AED Event
   Summaries and AED Coordinated Reports for Medical Director (Attachment 18) to assess
   quality of care in the CPR protocol. Additionally, the 412 MDG Executive Committee of the
   Medical Staff will be required to review AED Event Summaries and reports.
3. AED Location and Installation.
   3.1. The essential key to surviving a heart attack is early CPR and defibrillation. Therefore,
   AEDs should be strategically placed throughout a unit facility to reduce time between victim
   collapse and ability to provide initial shock, when indicated, to a heart attack victim.
      3.1.1. Factors to consider in determining AED placement include the following:
          3.1.1.1. Facility size and/or accessibility.
          3.1.1.2. Number of employees in the facility.
          3.1.1.3. Identified high risk environments.
          3.1.1.4. Number of people that may have public access to the facility on a daily basis.
          3.1.1.5. Average age of the facility occupants; older populations are at higher risk.
          3.1.1.6. Security levels that may hinder access to the facility by emergency response
          crews.
          3.1.1.7. Increase risk of incidence of heart disease given the community population
          as reported by local, state and national health departments.
          3.1.1.8. Use of high voltage electrical equipment.
          3.1.1.9. Emergency response protocol that may already be in place for your facility,
          keeping in mind that early initial shock, when indicated, increases potential for
          survival.
   3.2. To achieve optimal area coverage within a building, an AED should be positioned no
   more than one minute's travel time (one way) from any given point within the building.
   3.3. Optimal response time from the identification of a person "down" to the arrival of AED
   on-scene is three minutes or less.
   3.4. Optimal response time from the identification of a person down to the delivery of a
   shock (i.e., drop-to-shock) should be less than five minutes.

     3.5. AED accessory kits will be packed with the AED so the responder will not lose time
     deciding what to take to the emergency. These kits will contain the items listed in
     Attachment 10.
     3.6. AEDs should be stored in such a way that an alarm is activated when the unit is
     removed for use. This can be set up as a central alarm, whereby the local EMS is
     automatically notified, or as a local sounding alarm that can draw assistance to the scene.
     3.7. Depending on the population served by the facility, some AED locations will contain
     both adult and child chest leads. AEDs with both adult and child leads will be clearly marked
     by a sign stating “This device is equipped with both adult and child chest pads. Please check
     to ensure appropriate pads are utilized.” The sign will be posted outside of the AED cabinet.
     Specialized child chest leads are labeled CHILD on the package to prevent accidental misuse.
     Users will check to ensure they have the correct chest pads prior to application.
4. Emergency Response.
     4.1. An event timeline for a responder should ideally be as follows:
        4.1.1. Minute #1.
            4.1.1.1. Discovery of “downed” victim: Initiate Chain of Survival; Activate 9-1-1.
            4.1.1.2. Decision to retrieve AED.
            4.1.1.3. Identify closest AED.
        4.1.2. Minute #2-3.
            4.1.2.1. Retrieval of AED (round trip).
        4.1.3. Minute #4.
            4.1.3.1. Re-familiarization with AED instructions.
            4.1.3.2. Preparation of victim and application of chest pads.
            4.1.3.3. Detection of shockable rhythm.
            4.1.3.4. Delivery of shock.
5. Standing Down (Removal of AED) a Site for Noncompliance.
     5.1. Monthly report logs will be forwarded by an AED POC to the Organization PAD
     Coordinator by the seventh day of the following month. If the AED report logs are not
     received by the seventh day, then the Organization Program Coordinator will be notified and
     they will be required to follow up with the AED POCs for that specific AED to get the
     missing information and forward it to the Installation PAD Program Coordinator (412
     MDG/SGNE).
     5.2. The unit commander or civilian equivalent will be notified if no data is received by the
     Installation PAD Program Coordinator within 30 days following the end of the month.
     5.3. A memo will be sent to the unit commander or civilian equivalent to stand-down the
     AED site if no data is received for two consecutive months.
     5.4. The Installation PAD Program Coordinator will work with Medical Logistics, the
     Organization PAD Coordinator, and the Property Custodian to stand-down a site if required

              TRAUMATIC STRESS RESPONSE (TSR) INTERVENTION

A8.1. Traumatic Stress Response (TSR) {formerly Critical Incident Stress Management
(CISM) Information}
   A8.1.1. What is TSR? The primary goal of TSR teams is to foster resiliency in those
   exposed to potentially traumatic stress. This is accomplished through preparatory education
   for those likely to experience potentially traumatic stress, and through education, screening,
   psychological first aid, and referral for those exposed to potentially traumatic stress. TSR
   teams (1) serve as trauma response consultants to unit leaders; (2) prepare personnel likely to
   be exposed to potentially traumatic events; and (3) provide screening, education,
   psychological first aid, and referral for those exposed to potentially traumatic events. This
   document also provides revised training guidance.
A8.2. What events might precipitate a request for TSR services?
   A8.2.1. TSR services may be provided in response to events at the request of the unit
   commander. The services provided will vary depending on the nature of the mishap and the
   needs of the squadrons involved in the mishap. In general, the commander of any unit that
   incurs loss of personnel or significant injury to personnel as a result of a mishap should
   consult with a TSR team leader to determine whether there is a need for TSR support. Then,
   if the commander subsequently requests service, the nature of those services should be
   developed by the commander in collaboration with the TSR team leader.
   A8.2.2. Many types of events have the potential to produce individual and community
   traumatic stress. Events include: large scale disasters (tornadoes, bombings, hurricanes, etc.)
   and small scale disasters (suicide, death or near-death of coworker, workplace violence
   event, etc.). TSR services will be provided after traumatic events to help those who have
   experienced the events. The goal is to assist those affected by traumatic events to cope with
   the normal stress reaction in an effective manner. These actions are intended to minimize the
   impact of exposure to these events and prevent or mitigate permanent disability if possible.
A8.3. What is the procedure for requesting TSR services? The office of record for TSR
services is the Mental Health Clinic. The affected wing commander will support or arrange for
consultation between the TSR team chief and the affected unit commander to determine what
level of service, if any, is needed.
