This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-28, Awards and Decorations
Programs, and describes the policy and outlines procedures for conducting the 302nd Airlift
Wing (302AW) Recognition Program. This program outlines the process for recognizing, on a
quarterly and annual basis, members who have demonstrated outstanding job performance,
special achievements, and contributions to their local communities in the categories of Airman
(AMN), Non-Commissioned Officers (NCO), Senior Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCO),
Company Grade Officers (CGO), and Field Grade Officers (FGO). The category of First
Sergeant is recognized annually under the First Sergeant of the Year (FSOY) program. This
instruction applies to reserve and active duty assigned/detailed to the 302AW. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.
Route AF Form 847 to the OPR at 450 W. Hamilton Ave., Ste 171, Peterson AFB CO 80914.

                             302 AW RECOGNITION PROGRAM

1.1. Program Goal.
   1.1.1. This is a Wing recognition program established to ensure outstanding Wing members,
   who represent high standards of conduct, performance, and military image are recognized. It
   also establishes the process to submit annual winners to higher headquarters to compete in
   the Air Force Reserve Command 12 Outstanding Airman of the Year (AFRC 12 OAY)
   program (Reserve members) or the Air Mobility Command 12 Outstanding Airman of the
   Year (AMC 12 OAY) program (Active Duty).
1.2. Policy.
   1.2.1. On a quarterly basis, unit commanders and supervisors are encouraged to recognize
   AMN (E1-E4), NCOs (E5-E6), SNCOs (E7-E8), CGOs (O1-O3), and FGOs (O4-O5) each
   quarter for submission to their respective Groups. For the purpose of this instruction, the
   four Groups assigned to the 302AW are the Operations Group (OG), the Maintenance Group
   (MXG), the Mission Support Group (MSG) and the Aeromedical Staging Squadron (ASTS)
   & 302 Wing Staff (AW) both make up the last "group”. Personnel assigned/detailed to the
   302 AW Staff & ASTS will compete against each other; those winners will be submitted to
   compete at the Wing level. The reserve and active duty award nominees will compete within
   the group that their immediate rater is assigned/detailed. Award winners are selected in
   accordance with this instruction. In the event that only a single nomination is received, that
   quarterly board will not be held at the Wing level.
   1.2.2. Entries in the AF Form 1206, Nomination for Award, will focus on events which
   occurred during the award period.
1.3. Eligibility Criteria.
   1.3.1. All reserve and active duty members assigned/detailed to the 302 AW, who meet
   grade, and category requirements are eligible for nomination under this program and must be
   submitted to the Wing by their respective group.
   1.3.2. Military members who are subject to non-judicial punishment, or who have an
   unfavorable information file, control roster action, referral performance appraisal, or any
   other similar actions during the award period are not eligible for nomination. Nominees must
   also meet physical fitness standards as outlined in Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2905,
   Fitness Program, and any associated Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) supplements.
   1.3.3. Members will be nominated for the grade in which they served during the majority of
   the period. For example, if a member was a Senior Airman for two months and then
   promoted to Staff Sergeant, the member will compete in the Airman of the Quarter category.
   1.3.4. Senior Master Sergeants (SMSgt) selected or promoted to the rank of Chief Master
   Sergeant (CMSgt) during any portion of the quarterly award period are ineligible for
   consideration. (Exception: If a member has already been selected as the Wing nominee for
   an annual award prior to the promotion release, they will go forward to compete at the Wing,
   AF or AFRC levels).
 4                                                         302AWI36-2801 22 JANUARY 2014


     1.3.5. Lieutenant Colonels (Lt Col) selected or promoted to the rank of Colonel (Col) during
     any portion of the quarterly award period are ineligible for consideration. Additionally,
     FGOs serving as a Commander, Deputy Commander or Operations Officer, are also
     ineligible for consideration. (Exception: If a member has already been selected as the Wing
     nominee for an annual award prior to the promotion release, they will go forward to compete
     at the Wing, MAJCOM or AF levels).
     1.3.6. IAW Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2805, Special Trophies and Awards, First
     Sergeants nominated for the FSOY award must serve in the First Sergeant Air Force
     Specialty Code (AFSC), and have held the 8F000 Special Duty Identifier (SDI), for a
     minimum of 6 months during the annual award period in order to be eligible for nomination.
     1.3.7. Any individual selected as quarterly award winner at the Wing level, in any category,
     will be ineligible for submission in consecutive quarterly boards (members who win Wing
     level quarterly award cannot compete in back-to-back quarters), unless the following quarter
     falls in a new calendar year. This does not apply to the annual award nomination process, i.e.
     if a member is selected for an annual award in 2011, they may be selected for the same
     annual award in 2012.
     1.3.8. Nominees who have competed and won in the Wing quarterly award process will be
     submitted for the competition at the Wing level annual award process. Wing annual award
     winners will represent the 302 AW as a nominee in AFRC’s Twelve Outstanding Airman of

     (Active Duty).

           more than 50% of the board will be made up of squadron commanders (paper board
           only)
     1.7.3. Board members will serve as required to ensure timely completion of the recognition
     board that same day.
1.8. Selection Board Proceedings.
     1.8.1. If only one nomination is received for the board, the board will verify whether or not
     the nominee meets the eligibility criteria to be recognized as the unopposed winner. In the
     event that more than one package is received, the board will convene and for the Airmen and
     NCO boards the individual will interview before the board.
     1.8.2. Board members and nominees will wear the service dress uniform. Exceptions to this
     policy will be directed by the CCC and only under mitigating circumstances.
     1.8.3. Board members and the board president will score the packages. Selections for all
     winners are based on a total score consisting of the strength of the nomination package, dress
     and personal appearance, and the personal interview. The score of the board president will
     be used only to break a tie.
     1.8.4. All score sheets will be checked for accuracy by the Board Recorder and validated by
     the Board President. The winner’s name will be held in confidence until release is authorized
     by the 302 AW/CC, before the last sign out of the UTA.
1.9. Scoring Procedures.
     1.9.1. All board members will evaluate and score each nomination package and must be fair
     and impartial and set aside any bias (positive or negative). Packages will be evaluated based
     on the content and substance contained in the AF Form1206. It is the quality, not the
     quantity, of the statements that are important when scoring the impact of the nominees’s
     accomplishments.
1.10. Scoring guidelines (Enlisted and CGO).
     1.10.1. Leadership and Job Performance in Primary Duty. The member's leadership and
     job performance in their primary duty, including the development of new techniques, must
302AWI36-2801 22 JANUARY 2014                                                                   9


   have significantly contributed to increase mission effectiveness during the quarter/year.
   Individual accomplishments are essential--not unit accomplishments.
   1.10.2. Self-Improvement. The member must have shown improvement through off-duty
   education, achievements in professional or cultural societies or associations, development of
   creative abilities, and so on, during the award period. Includes military and civilian classes,
   professional development, self-development, etc. In general, self-improvement that is
   voluntary carries more weight than simply attending a mandatory class.
   1.10.3. Base or Community Involvement. The member must have contributed to the
   military or civilian community's welfare, morale or status during the reporting period. This
   includes base/squadron/community involvement such as the Top-3, booster club, CGO
   group, coach of a youth athletic team, scout leader, church elder, etc. Being a member of an
   organization is not as strong as participation in a leadership position (president, secretary,
   coach, etc.).
   1.10.4. Compare the accomplishments of each nominee and then score accordingly. Pay
   careful attention to the category criteria. Filler and fluff do not count as accomplishments.
   Do not score each category independently. Using the whole-person concept, grade each AF
   Form 1206 based on a maximum 80 points. An additional 20 points can be earned for those
   meeting a board in person. Half point increments may be used to differentiate between
   nominees. See attachment 2 for more details.
   1.10.5. Each board member will rank scored packages as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. In the event of
   equal scores, review packages and decide which to rate higher. Remember this is a "whole
   person" program and you are selecting the individual you think will best represent the Wing
   using the established scoring criteria.
   1.10.6. Rankings by board members will be tallied by the board recorder and the package
   with the highest overall ranking will be the winner for that category.
1.11. Board Results.
   1.11.1. The board president will deliver all packages, score sheets and notes to the MPS.
   The MPS will notify 302 AW/CCC of the results of the board.
   1.11.2. The 302 AW/CCC submits the board results to 302 AW/CC or designated
   representative for approval and release authorization before the last sign out of the UTA.
   1.11.3. Board results and nomination packages are retained IAW AFMAN 37-139, Records
   Disposition Schedule, Table 36-33, R17 for one year after completion of the board.
1.12. Quarterly/Annual Awards Ceremony, Awards, and Honors.
   1.12.1. Quarterly award recipients will be announced at an appropriate function or venue as
   approved by 302 AW/CC, such as Commander’s Call before sign-out on the Sunday of the
   same UTA.
   1.12.2. Quarterly Award recipients will have their wing award presented on Sunday of the
   following UTA. The winners and their squadron leadership are required to attend in service
   dress, if member is unable to be present (rescheduled UTA, TDY/Deployment, Leave, etc.)
   then the squadron leadership will receive the award on the member’s behalf.
   1.12.3. Annual award winners will be announced during the Annual Awards Banquet.

  1.12.4. An appropriate mission accomplishment award for all winners is authorized.

                302ND AIRLIFT WING ANNUAL AWARDS PROGRAM

3.1. Nomination Procedures.
   3.1.1. Each Group will nominate one member for each category. The four recognized
   groups are the 302 AW Operations Group (OG), the Maintenance Group (MXG), the
   Mission Support Group (MSG), and the Aeromedical Staging Squadron (ASTS) & 302 Wing
   Staff (AW) both make up the last "group". Personnel assigned/detailed to the 302 AW Staff
   & ASTS will compete against each other; those winners will be submitted to compete at the
   Wing level. The reserve and active duty award nominees will compete within the group that
   their immediate rater is assigned/detailed. Award winners are selected in accordance with
   this instruction. In the event that only a single nomination is received, that annual board will
   not be held at the Wing level.
   3.1.2. Nominations shall be sent electronically via e-mail by the group commander or

Force, this program recognizes 12 enlisted members in a range of grades representing a cross
section of career fields. There are three categories of competition: AMN, NCO, and SNCO.
   3.2.1. The AMN, NCO, SNCO annual awards packages are designed to mirror the
   requirements as established by 12 OAY guidelines. Wing level annual winners will compete

   OAY process (active duty members).

   3.2.5. Nominate members in the category of award that corresponds to the grade held for the
   majority of the award period. For example, if a member has held the grade of TSgt for seven
   months of the award period and is then promoted to MSgt, nominate the member in the NCO
   category, not the SNCO category. If the member is promoted at the six-month point of the
   award cycle, the Command determines in which category to nominate the member.
