This operating instruction (OI) implements AFI13-204, Functional Management of Airfield
Operations, AFI13-204_AMCSUP1, and directs procedures governing airfield operations
activities at Andrews Air Force Base (Joint Base Andrews-Naval Air Facility Washington)
[ICAO identifier KADW]. This OI defines support agency requirements and responsibilities for
services required and provided. These procedures and instructions are directive for all assigned
base-assigned/partner units and aircrews at Joint Base Andrews. These procedures do not
preclude exercising good judgment in the interest of flight safety. This OI contains Andrews Air
Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) [Federal Aviation Administration] procedures that are directive
in nature; as such this OI is signed by 316 WG/CC, Andrews ATCT Air Traffic Manager (ATM)
and ATCT SSC (System Support Center) Manager. Deviations to this OI are authorized only
when directed by Air Traffic Control (ATC) or in emergency situations where adherence could
jeopardize flight safety. This OI integrates multiple directives and documents affecting the entire
airfield environment at Andrews AFB into a consolidated OI applicable to all users and service
agencies. Andrews AFB Airfield Operations Board (AOB) members have approved this OI.
Refer recommended changes and questions for improvement to this OI in writing via the
quarterly AOB for approval or send to the 316th Operations Support Squadron/Airfield
Operations Flight (316 OSS/OSA). Conflicts with newer versions of referenced directives will
be brought to the attention of the 316 OSS/OSA Airfield Operations Flight Commander
(AOF/CC) via email or in writing. Prior to submission, changes must be coordinated by the
submitting organization with all affected agencies. Changes approved by the AOB will be
incorporated into subsequent versions of this OI. This OI will be reviewed annually in October
by 316 OSS/OSA and briefed at the AOB. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN)
33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records
 2                                                                ANDREWSAFBI13-204 10 NOVEMBER 2010

                                             Chapter 1

                   AIRFIELD FACILITIES: GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General Information. Andrews Air Force Base (Joint Base Andrews-Naval Air Facility
Washington) [ICAO Identifier KADW] is located at coordinates 38.48.65 N, 76.52.02 W. The
316th Wing is the host Wing at Andrews AFB; the airfield is home to the 89th Airlift Wing (Air
Mobility Command), 113th Wing, (DC Air National Guard), 459th Air Refueling Wing (Air
Force Reserve Command), and Naval Air Facility (NAF) Washington. Diverse tenant units
stationed at Andrews AFB include:
        Maryland State Police Aviation Command
        Civil Air Patrol-US Air Force (CAP-USAF)
        Department of Energy (DOE)
        Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)
        457th Airlift Squadron (375 AW/AMC)
        Marine Transport Squadron Andrews Detachment (VMR DET-ADW) [USMC]
        Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 1 (VR-1) [USNR]
        Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 48 (VR-48) [USNR]
        Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 53 (VR-53) [USNR]
        Fixed Wing Tactical Electronic Attack Squadron 209 (VAQ-209) [USNR]
        US Army Priority Air Transport (USAPAT)

Note: Washington Naval Air Facility ICAO Identifier, KNSF, is no longer in use.
     1.1.1. Andrews AFB serves as an Air Port of Entry (APOE). An APOE is a designated
     airport where initial entry to a country must be made to obtain clearance prior to entering said
     country. In the United States, APOE refers to an airport where initial entry can be made
     without obtaining prior permission to land from US Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
     All inbound aircraft originating from a foreign country are required to clear US Customs
     upon arrival; a minimum of 2 hour advance notice prior to arrival is required. CBP services
     are available 1000-1800L Monday-Friday; agents are on-call 24 hours a day. During non-
     duty hours/weekends/holidays, CPB Agents commute to Andrews as required; no-notice
     aircraft arrivals can anticipate a 2 hour minimum delay.
     1.1.2. All aircraft parking aprons/ramps, taxiways and runways at Andrews AFB are
     designated controlled areas. Controlled area access is restricted to personnel whose presence
     on the airfield is required to perform official duties and possess a valid Pathfinder Line
     Badge. Security Forces personnel (SFS) patrol the airfield and will challenge all violators.
     All personnel who observe individuals on the airfield without Pathfinder Badges or proper
     escort will notify Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC), 316th Wing (316 WG)
     Command Post, 89th Maintenance Group (89 MXG) Maintenance Operations Center
     (MOC), Andrews Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT), or Airfield Management (AM) by the
     most expedient means available
     1.1.3. Airfield Operating Hours. Andrews AFB airfield and air traffic control (ATC)
     services are operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
1.2. Runways. (See Attachment 2. For runway gradients, refer to Figure 1.1)
ANDREWSAFBI13-204 10 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                 9


   1.2.1. Runway 01L/19R (West Runway) Information. Runway 01L/19R is 9,300 ft long and
   200 ft wide. The first and last 1,000 ft are full-width concrete; the remaining runway length
   consists of an 88 ft wide concrete keel centerline with outboard asphalt edges. Runway
   01L/19R is CAT II ILS equipped and is designated the primary instrument runway. If
   practical, large aircraft (C-135 and larger) will use Runway 01L/19R for take-off and
   landing.
Note: Aircraft should minimize travel over asphalt outboard regions of the runway due to
deteriorated pavement integrity.
   1.2.2. Runway 01R/19L (East Runway). Runway 01R/19L is 9,755 ft long and 150 ft wide.
   The northernmost 325 ft are concrete; the remainder of the runway is asphalt. BAK-14 and
   MB-60 aircraft arresting systems are installed; refer to Paragraph 1.8 for additional
   information.
Note: MB-60 arresting systems are no longer operational, but have not yet been removed from
the airfield.

Figure 1.1. Runway Gradients.




   1.2.3. Instrument Critical Areas. (Refer to Figure 1.2) IAW FAAO 7650.16, a critical area
   is a specific ground area near a radiating localizer or glide slope antenna array, which must
   be protected from aircraft and vehicle parking and the unlimited movement of surface and air
   traffic, to ensure unimpeded signal reception integrity by the user aircraft.
       1.2.3.1. IAW FAA JO 7110.65, ATCT is required to protect ILS critical areas whenever
       ceilings are less than 800 ft and/or visibility is less than 2 Statute Miles (SM) to ensure no
       aircraft, vehicles, or equipment interfere with ILS signals. During periods of inclement
       weather, aircraft and vehicles are required to hold short of instrument hold lines.
 10                                             ANDREWSAFBI13-204 10 NOVEMBER 2010


Note: When Runway 01L/19R ILS CAT II operations are in progress, and inbound aircraft are
at/inside the final approach fix, aircraft and vehicles are prohibited from using certain taxiways
in order to protect missed approach surfaces. Refer to Paragraph 1.25. and Figure 1.7.
       1.2.3.2. Runway 01L/19R and 01R/19L ILS localizers and glide slopes have critical
       areas that must remain free of all fixed or mobile obstacles.
           1.2.3.2.1. Runway 01R/19L CAT I localizer critical areas are 400 ft wide, centered
           on the runway centerline, by 2,000 ft long upwind of the localizer antenna. The clear
           zones extend 50 ft to the rear and sides of the localizer antennas.
           1.2.3.2.2. Runway 01L/19L CAT II localizer critical areas are 500 ft wide, centered
           on the runway centerline, by 5,000 ft long upwind of the localizer antenna. The clear
           zones extend 50 ft to the rear and sides of the localizer antennas.
           1.2.3.2.3. Glide slope critical areas are established IAW FAAO 6750.16D, and run
           parallel to the runway edge, with a length extending 50 ft behind the glide slope
           antennas downwind 1,300 ft, by 200 ft wide. Additionally, a 35° angle line from the
           glide slope antenna mast to the established edge of the critical area exists. Only
           authorized personnel (e.g. Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems [ATCALS]
           Maintenance) may enter these clear zones after obtaining ATCT approval.
       1.2.3.3. Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ) and Obstacle Clearance Surfaces (OCS).
           1.2.3.3.1. The POFZ is an 800 foot wide by 200 ft long rectangular area centered on
           the runway centerline, beginning at and extending outward from the threshold. The
           POFZ is designed to protect aircraft flying precision approaches from ground vehicles
           and other aircraft when the ceiling is less than 300 ft, or visibility is less than ¾ SM
           (or runway visual range [RVR] is less than 4,000 ft).
           1.2.3.3.2. The OCS, measured by Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS),
           normally begins 200 ft from the landing threshold point, measured along the final
           approach course centerline, extending to the final approach fix.
           1.2.3.3.3. The POFZ requires protection when the reported weather is less than 800 ft
           and/or visibility is less than 2 SM from the time an approach aircraft is within 2 NM
           of the landing threshold until the approach aircraft passes the hold line. In the event
           that taxiing/parked aircraft or vehicles are not clear of the POFZ or OCS, controllers
           are to provide traffic advisories only to the arriving aircraft regarding the position of
           the offending aircraft/vehicles.
Note: Only horizontal surfaces (e.g. aircraft wings) can penetrate the POFZ. Vertical surfaces
(e.g. aircraft fuselage or vertical stabilizer) cannot penetrate the POFZ. When protection of the
POFZ is not possible, the published instrument approach minimums cannot be lower than 300 ft
visibility and ¾ SM visibility.

Table 1.1. Taxiway Designations, Widths, and Composition.




   1.3.1. Aircraft with wingspans exceeding 120 ft are prohibited from using Taxiway W-2.
   1.3.2. Taxiway W-3 is accessible only to the Presidential Airlift Group (PAG).
   1.3.3. Taxiway W-5 is off limits to all transient and non-assigned aircraft.
   1.3.4. Aircraft with wingspans exceeding 165 ft are prohibited from using Taxiway Echo
   adjacent to the 459th Air Refueling Wing (459 ARW) Ramp without prior coordination with
   the 459 ARW Maintenance Operations Center (MOC). The use of an approved Follow-Me
   Vehicle and trained wing walkers is required.
   1.3.5. Taxiway E-7 is restricted to C-9 and smaller aircraft due to wingtip clearance
   requirements from East Ramp aircraft parking spots.
   1.3.6. Taxiway A-2 is accessible only to 113 WG Air Sovereignty Alert (ASA) aircraft.
   Aircraft with wingspans exceeding 33 ft are prohibited from using Taxiway A-2.
1.4. Runway Selection/Change Procedures.
   1.4.1. ATCT shall select the runway configuration and coordinate with Potomac
   Consolidated Terminal Radar Approach Control (Potomac TRACON) prior to change.
   Additional information is contained in the Letter of Agreement (LOA) between ATCT and
   Potomac TRACON. Runway selection at Andrews AFB is determined by the runway
   configuration at Washington Reagan National (DCA). ATCT coordinates are required with
   DCA ATCT when selecting/changing the active runway.
ANDREWSAFBI13-204 10 NOVEMBER 2010                                                            13


   1.4.2. When a Runway change occurs, ATCT will notify AM and Base Weather (316
   OSS/OSW).
   1.4.3. AM will notify flying units and airfield support agencies as directed by locally-
   developed Quick Reaction Checklists.
   1.4.4. Runway 01L is designated the calm wind runway.
1.5. Controlled Movement Area (CMA). The CMA defines that area where ATCT
mandates/maintains positive control of aircraft and vehicle activity. All aircraft, vehicles, and
personnel operating in the CMA must establish two-way radio communication with ATCT while
operating in the CMA. Refer to AAFBI13-213, Airfield Driving, for more information regarding
the CMA and associated procedures.
Note: Figure 1.3. identifies the layout and boundaries of the CMA. Double yellow taxi lane
edge markings denote the boundaries of the CMA on the airfield.

Figure 1.3. Controlled Movement Area (CMA) Layout.




   1.5.1. Aircraft Operations in the CMA.
       1.5.1.1. ATCT will maintain positive control of all aircraft operating on all portions of
       the CMA. Vehicles, equipment, and personnel on ramps and taxiways outside the CMA
       need not contact ATCT, but will give way to all taxiing or towed aircraft. All
       personnel must exercise extreme caution and remain vigilant when operating in these
       areas.
 14                                            ANDREWSAFBI13-204 10 NOVEMBER 2010


       1.5.1.2. ATCT will notify aircraft of all known or observed hazards existing along an
       aircraft taxi route, inclusive of modified taxi routes due to taxiway closures/construction.
       ATCT is not responsible for positive control in designated blind areas. Refer to
       Figure 8.1 for airfield visual and radio blind spots.
       1.5.1.3. ATCT will report all CMA Violations and runway intrusions to AM and the
       FAA Liaison (316 OSS/OSAF) immediately.
1.6. Airfield Lighting Systems. The 316th Civil Engineering Squadron Airfield Lighting (316
CES/CEOFE) owns and maintains all airfield lighting at Andrews AFB.
   1.6.1. Runway 01L/19R: Approach Lighting System ALSF-2 with Sequenced Flashing
   Lights (SFLs); High Intensity Runway Lights (HIRLs); Touchdown Zone Lighting (TDZL);
   Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI); and Runway Centerline Lighting.
Note: Runway 01L/19R PAPI and ILS Runway Point of Intercept (RPI) are not coincidental.
PAPIs are set for aircraft height group 4. Height group 4 corresponds with 747/767/A300 class
airplanes, per FAA Order 8260.3, para 2-9.
   1.6.2. Runway 01R/19L:       Approach Lighting System ALSF-1 with SFLs; HIRLs; and
   PAPIs.
Note: Runway 01R/19L PAPIs and ILS RPI are not coincidental. Runway 01R/19L PAPIs are
set for aircraft height group 3. Height group 3 consists of C-17/727/757 class airframes, IAW
FAAO 8260.3, para 2-9.
   1.6.3. Control of Airfield Lighting Systems. ATCT controls all airfield lighting systems
   except obstruction lights. Airfield lighting systems are operated IAW FAA JO 7110.65.
   Lighting is supported by a backup generator. 316 CES Power Production personnel will
   respond to the airfield lighting vault to set lighting as instructed by ATCT when alternate
   operations are in place, or if primary systems are inoperative. Airfield Lighting personnel
   will respond as necessary to repair airfield lighting outages, specifically those affecting
   Runway 01L/19R ILS CAT II capability.
   1.6.4. No-Light Visibility Minima. If approach lights become inoperative, AM will
   coordinate with ATCT and ensure no-light minimums are in effect; applicable NOTAMS
   will be sent and Airfield Lighting personnel will be notified. No-Light visibility minima are
   established IAW AFMAN11-226 and are listed on the applicable approach plate.
   1.6.5. Runway 01R/19L Airfield Lighting Auxiliary Power Procedures/Operations.
   Auxiliary power operation responsibilities are shared between the USAF and the FAA.
   USAF generators support airfield lighting and the Runway 01R/19L ILS.
       1.6.5.1. ATCT responsibilities. ATCT shall:
           1.6.5.1.1. Activate the generator when conditions warrant the use of backup power.
Note: Presently there is no transfer of power capability between the two airfield lighting
generators. ATCT will only activate generator #1. In the event of failure of generator #1, ATCT
shall notify 316 CES Job Control and request activation of generator #2.

1.7. Permanently Closed/Unusable Portions of the Airfield. (See Attachment 2)
   1.7.1. Runway 01L/19R overruns are unusable due to pavement deterioration.
   1.7.2. The Compass Rose is closed due to pavement degradation. The Compass Rose is
   designated as the Alternate Hot Cargo Pad, but is accessible only to towed aircraft.
1.8. Aircraft Arresting Systems. (See Attachment 2) Aircraft arresting system availability is
crucial to supporting the 113 WG ASA mission. Additionally, Andrews AFB is a primary divert
base for regional Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps fighter aircraft.
   1.8.1. Runway 01L/19R is not equipped with any permanent arresting systems.
   1.8.2. Runway 01R/19L is equipped with a BAK-14 arresting system.
       1.8.2.1. BAK-14s are located 1,500 ft from the approach end of Runway 01R and 1,536
       ft from the approach end of Runway 19L. The BAK-14 consists of a 1 ¼ inch cable with
       a 1,200 ft run out and a 50,000 lb weight setting. BAK-14s are bidirectional (can be
       engaged from either side). BAK-14s shall be identified as “approach end cable” and
       “departure end cable.”
       1.8.2.2. The BAK-14 primary control panel is located in the ATCT Cab. A secondary
       control panel is installed in the Fire Department (Building 1287). Normal operation of
       the cable system will be by radio remote control; hard-wire in the BAK-14 pits is
       intended for emergency backup only.
       1.8.2.3. If the control panel is inoperative, ATCT will coordinate with the Fire
       Department and/or notify Barrier Maintenance to manually configure the departure end
       cable. Specific procedures are outlined in the LOA between AM, ATCT, Fire
       Department, and Barrier Maintenance.
Note: The BAK-14 is not designed to operate in the configured/up position with repeated
aircraft rollovers. Repeated high-speed aircraft rollovers will damage system components and
reduce system reliability/availability. Low speed taxi rollovers must also be kept to a minimum
to prevent degradation of system performance. In the event the BAK-14 is not required to stop
an aircraft, ATCT should lower the BAK-14 cable prior to aircraft rollover.
ANDREWSAFBI13-204 10 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                17


Note: Large frame or heavy aircraft (over 12,500 lb) taxiing over a raised cable will result in
declaration of a suspected arresting system malfunction.
       1.8.2.4. ATCT responsibilities. ATCT shall:
           1.8.2.4.1. Remotely actuate the BAK-14 to raise and lower the departure end cable as
           required to support 113 WG F-16 aircraft and for other base-assigned aircraft upon
           request.
           1.8.2.4.2. Normally raise the departure end cable for all F-16 takeoffs and landings
           without request. The approach end cable will be raised only upon direct request from
           the aircrew or other appropriate military personnel.
           1.8.2.4.3. During an emergency, should approach end cable engagement be
           requested, raise both the approach and departure end cables.
           1.8.2.4.4. Notify AM immediately when there is a known or suspected arresting
           system malfunction. If “Fire” is indicated; ATCT will initiate a ground emergency on
           BAK-14 to all responding agencies via the PCAS. Fire apparatus will only respond
           to BAK-14 arresting system upon request from ATCT in the event of an emergency
           aircraft landing or possible fire displayed on the BAK-14 panel.
Note: ATCT personnel will contact 316 CES customer service directly (DSN 858-5151; Comm
301-981-5151) in the event of a water, power, communication, and/or air quality issue.
           1.8.2.4.5. Notify AM of all impending barrier engagements and activate the Primary
           Crash Alarm System (PCAS) when an engagement occurs. (See also Paragraph
           5.1).
       1.8.2.5. 316 CES/CEOFP (Barrier Maintenance) responsibilities. Barrier Maintenance
       shall:
           1.8.2.5.1. Assume responsibility for inspection, maintenance/operation, training, and
           certification of the BAK-14.
           1.8.2.5.2. Ensure appropriate NOTAMs are issued by AM for any malfunctions,
           outages, or preventative maintenance checks.
           1.8.2.5.3. Schedule and coordinate monthly maintenance/unscheduled maintenance
           requirements with AM.
       1.8.2.6. AM responsibilities. AM shall:

   1.8.4. Mobile Aircraft Arresting Systems (MAAS) are temporary arresting systems that can
   be installed in the event the BAK-14s are unusable for an extended period of time and single
   runway operations are in progress.
   1.8.5. Monthly arresting system preventative maintenance and training will be scheduled and
   accomplished during preventative maintenance runway closures. Barrier Maintenance will
   notify AM of all arresting system outages and unscheduled maintenance requirements.
   1.8.6. ATCT will advise AM of all impending barrier engagements and/or activate the
   Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS) whenever a barrier engagement occurs.
   1.8.7. Following an arresting system engagement, runway operations will be suspended until
   Barrier Maintenance has reconfigured the cable and AM conducts a check. AM will notify
   ATCT once runway operations can be resumed; ATCT will not resume runway operations
   without coordinating with AM.
   1.8.8. PAG aircraft operations.    (These procedures apply only during single runway
   operations)
       1.8.8.1. Both approach and departure end arresting system cables will be lowered for Air
       Force One/Two (AF-1/AF-2) operations.
       1.8.8.2. During VC-25 training sorties, the departure end cable will remain configured
       unless the Presidential Airlift Squadron (PAS) requests the cable be lowered. This
       request will be relayed either to ATCT or AM.
       1.8.8.3. Should the approach end cable be configured, it will be lowered prior to all
       VC-25 training sorties.
       1.8.8.4. When BAK-14s require manual configuration , or if MAAS are installed and
       operational:
Note: AM will notify and coordinate with the 113 WG Supervisor of Flying (SOF) to minimize
the impact or arresting system unavailability on aircraft sorties.
          1.8.8.4.1. During VC-25 training sorties, the Pilot-in-Command will notify ATCT or
          AM at least 30 minutes prior departure/arrival to allow sufficient time for Barrier
          Maintenance to lower the arresting system cable before takeoff/landing.
          1.8.8.4.2. ATCT will afford priority to Barrier Maintenance and AM vehicles
          immediately following AF-1 landing and takeoff, IAW LOA between AM, ATCT,
          Barrier Maintenance, and US Secret Service, in order to reduce the time necessary to
          reconfigure the cable and ready the arresting system for engagement.
          1.8.8.4.3. The arresting system cable will be lowered at least 30 minutes prior to
          scheduled AF-1 arrival/departure or Ramp Freeze (whichever is earliest).
1.9. Parking Plan/Restrictions. (See Attachment 2) Andrews AFB aircraft parking consists
of two large ramps/aprons, known as the West and East Ramps.
   1.9.1. West Ramp. DYNCORP provides TA services on the West Ramp 24 hours a day,
   7 days a week. Ownership listings for the tenant parking spots are maintained by 316 OSS.

1.16. Hot Pit Refueling. Two certified hot pit refueling areas located on the 113 WG Ramp are
approved for use by 113 WG (121 FS) aircraft. Pilots must use extreme caution when taxing in
the vicinity of this area. Refer to Figure 1.4
ANDREWSAFBI13-204 10 NOVEMBER 2010                                                             23


Figure 1.4. Hot Pit Refueling Areas.




1.17. Engine Test/Run-Up Areas and Procedures. Positive radio contact with ATCT Ground
Control (VHF 121.8) is required prior to all aircraft positioning, engine tests, and run-ups.
Note: AM and ATCT must be notified of all maintenance engine tests/run ups before aircraft are
positioning on any pads. AM and ATCT will be notified by 89 AW/113 WG/459 ARW MOC or
the aircraft maintainer/operator when engine tests/run-ups are terminated and aircraft are moved.
   1.17.1. Aircraft maintainers/operators will coordinate all engine test/run-up requirements (to
   include tests/run-ups during quiet hours/periods) through the assigned Unit MOC.
   89 MXG/113 MXG/459 MXG MOCs will notify AM, ATCT and BDOC of all proposed
   engine test/run-up operations to ensure pads are available and taxi routes are not impacted.
   1.17.2. Quiet hours engine test/run-up approval authority. 316 OG/CC, or designated
   representative, is the approval authority for engine tests/run-ups during Quiet Hours/Periods.
   Quiet hours are daily 2200-0700L (inclusive) and those in support of special functions (e.g.
   change of command ceremonies in Hangar 3).
Note: PAG/CC is the approval authority for PAG-assigned aircraft quiet hour engine test/run-
ups. PAG/CC will notify 316 OG/CC of any quiet hour engine run-up as soon as practical.
   1.17.3. Locations. (See Attachment 2).
Note: There will be no engine tests/run-ups or aircraft positioned on Pads 92, 93 or 94 one hour
prior to a Distinguished Visitor Code 1 (DV-1) arrival or departure.
       1.17.3.1. Pad 94 is the primary location for maintenance engine tests/run-ups and will be
       used for larger aircraft (e.g. C-17, C-5, KC-10, etc.).
       1.17.3.2. Pads 92 and 93, between the runways, may be used as alternate locations for
       engine tests/run-ups in order to minimize the operational impact on Taxiway Whiskey.
 24                                           ANDREWSAFBI13-204 10 NOVEMBER 2010


       1.17.3.3. Hangar 19 complex is the primary location for VC-25 maintenance engine
       tests/run-ups.
Note: Aircraft parking reference markings are painted on Pad 94 to facilitate proper parking and
orientation of 89 AW aircraft (e.g. C-32, C-40) to mitigate FOD potential.
   1.17.4. Engine tests/run ups for large aircraft may require closing the taxiway adjacent to the
   designated pad due to a lack of lateral wing tip clearance.
   1.17.5. Maintenance engine runs exceeding 70% RPM, or field barometric pressure for
   reciprocating engines, will not be conducted between 2200L and 0700L, unless approved by
   the 316 OG/CC or designated representative.
   1.17.6. Aircraft will not be positioned with exhaust pointing southwest on Pad 93 or
   southeast on Pads 92 and 94 to prevent FOD and dust from being blown onto the approach
   end of the runway and to prevent potential wake/exhaust turbulence on the approach.
   1.17.7. VC-25 engine runs above idle (70% N2) are authorized on Pad 94.
   1.17.8. Engine Test/Run-Ups at Locations other than Pads 92-94.
       1.17.8.1. C-17 above idle engine tests up to 70% N1 may be accomplished for a
       maximum of 2 minutes (in reverse thrust) on transient rows 12 and 13, 0700-2200L
       following 89 MXG MOC, AM, and DYNCORP TA coordination. All other C-17 engine
       runs above 70% N1 will be accomplished IAW published procedures and aircraft
       technical orders.
       1.17.8.2. The 459 ARW engine run area is in the fuel cell repair area located at the north
       end of the 459 ARW Ramp.
       1.17.8.3. C-12 engine tests/run-ups may be accomplished on the alternate fuel cell repair
       area on the north end of the 459 ARW Ramp; however, this area will not be used for
       maintenance engine runs. C-12 maintainers/operators must coordinate requests through
       459 MXG MOC.
Note: This excludes engine tests/run-ups at idle power.
       1.17.8.4. High power engine tests/run-ups may not be performed anywhere on the East
       Ramp. High power is considered above idle, where aircraft are required to taxi in/out of
       chocks.
   1.17.9. 113 WG Engine Test/Run-Up Procedures and Locations.
       1.17.9.1. 201 AS may conduct engine tests/run-ups on Spot A-3 (alternate spot C-4) of
       the 201 AS Ramp. At this location, only one engine is allowed above idle (not to exceed
       80% N1 maximum RPM) for no more than 5 minutes in duration. Aircraft must be
       pointed east; hours of operations are 0700-2200L. AM shall be notified 30 minutes prior
       of all engine tests/run-ups.
       1.17.9.2. 113 MXG will coordinate with ATCT and AM for F-16 engine runs outside of
       their assigned areas within the 113 WG Ramp.
   1.17.10. 89 AW Engine Test/Run-Up Procedures.
ANDREWSAFBI13-204 10 NOVEMBER 2010                                                               25


       1.17.10.1. The on-duty DYNCORP Andrews Support Division, Aircraft Branch (SAM
       4) is responsible for authorizing aircraft engine tests/run-ups; SAM 4 will recommend
       engine tests/run-ups during daily quiet hours (daily 2200L-0700L) for 89 AW mission
       aircraft. SAM 4 will notify 89 MXG MOC of quiet hour engine runs; 89 MXG/MOC
       will in turn notify AM and ATCT. AM will inform 316 OG/CC and obtain approval.
Note: Mission aircraft include all Special Air Mission (SAM) primary and backup aircraft,
except for PAG aircraft.
       1.17.10.2. Designated spare and alert aircraft engine test/run up requirements will not
       normally be conducted during Base Quiet Hours. The only exception is when no other
       option exists to meet a mission requirement as determined by the 89 MXG Production
       Superintendent. Coordinate any engine tests/run-ups requests during Quiet Hours
       through DYNCORP Management, 316 OG/CC (or designated representative) and AM.
       Brief DYNCORP Management and 89 MXG/CC of any unanticipated quiet hour engine
       runs performed no later than 0700L the next duty day.
       1.17.10.3. PAG Aircraft: The Presidential Logistics Squadron (PLS) Production
       Superintendent authorizes PAG aircraft maintenance engine runs. Engine tests/run-ups up
       to and including full power are normally performed within PAG maintenance areas.
       1.17.10.4. PLS will coordinate all potential PAG quiet hour engine runs through 89
       MXG MOC, who will in turn notify AM and ATCT of all proposed engine tests/run-ups.
Note: PAG/CC is the approval authority for PAG-assigned aircraft quiet hour engine test/run-
ups. PAG/CC will notify 316 OG/CC of any quiet hour engine run-up as soon as practical.
   1.17.11. To prevent potential aircraft damage and to mitigate FOD, aircraft placement for
   engine tests/run-ups should comply with guidance contained in Table 1 of HQ AFCESA
   Engineering Technical Letter (ETL) 07-3, Jet Engine Thrust Standoff Requirements for
   Airfield Asphalt Edge Pavements, to ensure safe standoff distances aft of aircraft tail to
   pavement edge.
       1.17.11.1. If the design aircraft is not listed in Table 1 of ETL 07-3, contact 316
       CES/CEOHP (Horizontal) for additional guidance.
       1.17.11.2. HQ AMC has recommended maintaining a minimum of 25 ft aft of aircraft
       tail to the edge of the shoulder if there is a even a remote possibility of the aircraft
       jumping chocks, and the airfield geometry precludes maintaining the recommended
       distances for large aircraft (e.g. B747, C-5, etc.). This position is less than that required
       by ETL 07-3 and may result in damage to the shoulder pavement. IAW 89 MXG
       guidance, a minimum distance of 30 ft will be used to position aircraft for maintenance
       engine runs.
   1.17.12. Maintainers/operators will ensure all engine test/run-up pads are FOD-free and fire
   bottles/support equipment is removed after termination of all engine tests/run-ups.
1.18. Drag Chute Jettison Areas and Procedures. (See Figure 1.5)
   1.18.1. Transient aircraft with valid PPRs that will deploy drag chutes must notify ATCT
   prior to landing to ensure airfield support agencies and AM are poised/ready to retrieve the
   chute.

  1.18.2. Aircraft will vacate the active runway and associated VFR hold line (or instrument
  hold line if conditions dictate) prior to jettisoning chutes.
  1.18.3. ATCT will:
     1.18.3.1. Provide instructions to the aircraft to aid in drag chute jettisoning.
     1.18.3.2. ATCT may direct the aircraft to an alternate location/taxiway for chute jettison
     if required.
  1.18.4. Aircraft landing Runway 01L/19R will: (Refer to Figure 1.5)
     1.18.4.1. Jettison drag chutes on Taxiway Echo (north and south end) unless otherwise
     instructed by ATCT.
     1.18.4.2. Aircraft destined for the East Side will retain chutes until crossing Runway
     01R/19L unless otherwise instructed by ATCT.
  1.18.5. Aircraft landing Runway 01R/19L will: (Refer to Figure 1.5)
     1.18.5.1. Jettison drag chutes at either Pad 94 (south end) or Pad 14 (north end) unless

   1.20.4. Heavy Aircraft Jet Thrust Avoidance Procedures.
       1.20.4.1. AM will determine the preferred taxi routing for aircraft based on aircraft
       versus pavement weight bearing capacity, aircraft wingspan, engine configuration, and
       obstructions. AM will ensure ATCT and TA services are aware of any restrictions to
       wide body/heavy aircraft. Wide body/heavy aircraft (e.g. B747, C-17, C-5, etc.) tend to
       create debris on the airfield movement area.
       1.20.4.2. Jet Blast deflectors are installed on the Navy Trim Pad and in the PAG
       Compound.
1.21. Airfield Maintenance.

       inspect the runways in conjunction with preventative maintenance closures.
       1.21.2.4. Coordinate emergency spall repairs with the Airfield Manager and AM in order
       to mitigate FOD, minimize mishap potential, sustain aircraft operations, and prolong
       pavement integrity.
Note: The Airfield Pavement Maintenance Team must coordinate all spall repairs with the
Airfield Manager and AM. AM will issue required NOTAMs and notify ATCT.
   1.21.3. Airfield Sweeper Operations. Sweeper operations are instrumental to FOD
   prevention, and minimizing aircraft damage and operational delays due to FOD.
Note: Sweeper personnel will closely monitor airfield construction areas and haul routes for
FOD.
       1.21.3.1. Airfield sweepers operate daily from 0600-1700L unless otherwise directed by
       AM to accommodate unusual aircraft operations, construction, or maintenance.
       1.21.3.2. Daily sweeper operations normally follow the routes identified in Figure 1.6
       Sweepers access the runways during scheduled preventative maintenance closure and
       whenever requested by AM.
       1.21.3.3. Airfield sweeper operations will be concentrated on primary aircraft taxi routes
       (Taxiways Whiskey, Echo, Sierra and November) and the intersections of taxiways and
       runways; these areas are susceptible to FOD when aircraft enter and exit the runway.
ANDREWSAFBI13-204 10 NOVEMBER 2010                                                          29


      1.21.3.4. Airfield sweeper personnel are on standby 24 hours a day with a 15 minute
      response time for airfield emergencies or contingency situations. Sweepers will notify
      AM prior to beginning work on the airfield and when complete

Figure 1.6. Airfield Sweeper Routes.




   1.21.4. Airfield Mowing Operations. Grass height maintenance is essential in deterring
   bird/wildlife activity and mitigating bird strikes. 316 CES is responsible for ensuring all
   personnel performing grass cutting operations on the airfield possess valid Andrews Airfield
   Drivers Licenses and are equipped with a VHF radio to coordinate CMA access and
   movement with ATCT.
      1.21.4.1. During mowing season, 316 CES Grounds Maintenance, in conjunction with
      AM, will establish a mowing schedule to ensure all grassy areas of the airfield are
      maintained between 7-14 inches IAW Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH)
      requirements.
      1.21.4.2. 316 CES Grounds Maintenance will take advantage of scheduled preventative
      maintenance runway closures in order to cut grass close to the Runway edge.
      1.21.4.3. All mowing operations and grounds work accomplished on the airfield must be
      coordinated with AM. Mowers will notify AM prior to commencing mowing and when
      complete.

   1.24.3. Helicopter noise abatement procedures.
      1.24.3.1. Daily between 2000-0700L, helicopters are not permitted to operate between
      Runway 01L/19R and the western perimeter of the base below 800 ft AGL and will avoid
      overflying base housing.
      1.24.3.2. 1 HS alert scrambles, Maryland State Police helicopters engaged in life-
      alert/flight missions, and US Coast Guard alert missions are exempt from these
      restrictions. If operations below 800 ft AGL are necessary, these units shall notify AM
      the following duty day for potential noise complaint purposes.
   1.24.4. North Departure noise abatement procedures.
      1.24.4.1. North IFR departure aircraft executing a left turn will begin a standard rate turn
      within 1.5 NM of the departure end of the runway (ADW/3 DME). If unable, pilots are
      not expected to accept their clearance.
      1.24.4.2. Aircraft making an east turnout for an IFR/VFR departure, including entry into
      the closed or VFR rectangular traffic pattern, from either Runway 01L or Runway 01R,
      will not begin a right turn until reaching Suitland Parkway (ADW/1.5 DME) and at an
      altitude at or above 400 ft AGL.
   1.24.5. Landing. Before landing, aircraft should maintain traffic pattern altitude as long as
   practical.
   1.24.6. Noise Complaints. During normal duty hours (0800-1700L), noise complaints
   should be referred to 316 WG Public Affairs (316 WG/PA) Office. After normal duty hours,
   AM will record the information and forward it to 316 WG/PA the following duty day.
   1.24.7. Field Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP) Noise Abatement Considerations. Refer to
   Paragraph 8.30.1
1.25. Protecting Instrument Landing System (ILS) Critical Areas and CAT II Missed
Approach Surfaces.
   1.25.1. When ceilings are less than 800 ft and/or visibility is less than 2 SM, ATCT will
   direct aircraft and vehicles will hold short of instrument hold lines to protect the ILS Critical
   Areas. Vehicles requesting CMA access will be instructed by ATCT of the requirement to
   hold short of instrument hold lines.
   1.25.2. Protection of ILS CAT II Missed Approach Surfaces. (See Figure 1.7) In CAT II
   weather conditions, ATCT will procedurally protect ILS CAT II missed approach areas as
   outlined below:
      1.25.2.1. Whenever Runway 01L ILS CAT II is in use and when aircraft are at or inside
      the final approach fix, aircraft and vehicles are prohibited from using Taxiway W-4 and
      the southwest corner of Taxiway Whiskey (Southwest Hammerhead).
ANDREWSAFBI13-204 10 NOVEMBER 2010                                                         35


       1.25.2.2. Aircraft with tail heights exceeding 24 ft AGL are prohibited from using
       Taxiway Charlie between the runways and between Runway 01L/19R and Taxiway
       Whiskey. See note.
       1.25.2.3. Whenever Runway 19R ILS CAT II is in use and when aircraft are at or inside
       the final approach fix, aircraft and vehicles are prohibited from using Taxiway W-1 and
       the northwest corner of Taxiway Whiskey (Northwest Hammerhead).
       1.25.2.4. Aircraft with tail heights exceeding 50 ft AGL are prohibited from using
       Taxiway Charlie between the runways and between Runway 01L/19R and Taxiway
       Whiskey. See note.
Note: ATCT will restrict all aircraft from using the aforementioned portions of Taxiway
Charlie, regardless of tail height.

   1.26.3. Other Restricted Areas. Areas adjacent to Hangar 18, Hangar 19, Taxiway W-3, and
   Taxiway W-5 are designated as restricted areas. These areas are not available to non-
   assigned and transient aircraft use.
1.27. Procedures for Suspending Runway Operations.
   1.27.1. ATCT and AM may suspend runway operations if there is reason to believe a hazard
   may exist on or near the runway or approach/departure environment. If AM suspends
   runway operations, ATCT may not resume operations without coordinating with AM. Vice
   versa, if ATCT suspends runway operations, AM cannot resume operations without
   coordinating with ATCT.
Note: ATCT and AM are the only two agencies with authority to suspend runway operations.
   1.27.2. ATCT will automatically suspend runway operations following aircraft arresting
   system and/or MAAS engagements. AM will notify ATCT when runway operations may be
   resumed; ATCT may not resume runway operations without coordinating with and receiving
   approval from AM.
   1.27.3. AM will suspend runway operations during runway sterilizations and during manual
   configuration/raising/lowering of aircraft arresting system (BAK-14/Expeditionary BAK-12)
   cables. Once runway sterilizations and aircraft arresting system configurations are complete,
   AM will notify ATCT that runway operations can be resumed. ATCT may not resume
   operations without coordinating with and receiving approval from AM.
   1.27.4. Emergencies. Following the landing of an emergency aircraft, ATCT will suspend
   runway operations until the emergency has been terminated or the emergency aircraft has
   safely exited the runway environment. AM will conduct a runway/FOD check and notify
   ATCT that runway operations are resumed. ATCT may not resume runway operations until
   AM notifies ATCT that a runway/FOD check is complete and runway operations are
   resumed.
   1.27.5. Refer to Paragraph 1.22.4 regarding suspension of runway operations upon receipt
   of Braking Action Advisories of “nil.”
1.28. Procedures for Opening and Closing Runways.
   1.28.1. Only AM can officially open or close runways, taxiways/taxi lanes, and aprons.
   1.28.2. Runways closures lasting three or fewer days will be closed via NOTAM IAW
   ETL 04-2, 9.1.3. Note. Runway closures exceeding three days necessitates proper marking
   and lighting requirements as directed by ETL 04-2.
   1.28.3. AM responsibilities. AM shall:
       1.28.3.1. Coordinate with ATCT, airfield support agencies, and all base-assigned tenant
       flying units prior to closing/reopening runways.
       1.28.3.2. Prior to reopening the runway (regardless of closure duration), complete a
       thorough runway inspection remove NOTAMs (if applicable), and notify ATCT and all
       airfield support agencies and base-assigned flying units the runway is reopened.
ANDREWSAFBI13-204 10 NOVEMBER 2010                                                         37


1.29. Coordinating Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS) Outages. FAA
coordination ATCALS/NAVAIDs procedures are delineated in LOA between ADW SSC,
Potomac TRACON Service Operations Center (SOC), ATCT, and 316 OG.
Note: Potomac TRACON SOC will cancel preventative maintenance outages of FAA
ATCALS/NAVAIDs if marginal weather conditions dictate (e.g. preventative maintenance
outage of Runway 01L glide slope scheduled and weather conditions necessitate ILS CAT II
operations). Applicable NOTAMs will be rescinded.
   1.29.1. Scheduled outages. Potomac TRACON SOC [FAA] is the focal point for scheduling
   ATCALS outages, recurring maintenance of ATCALS/NAVAIDs, and ATCALS resource
   management.
       1.29.1.1. The SOC will notify AM of scheduled ATCALS outages IAW FAAO
       6000.15E, App 11.
       1.29.1.2. Outages required to maintain safe operations of FAA ATCALS/NAVAIDs
       facilities shall be performed IAW FAAO 6000.15E.
   1.29.2. Unscheduled outages. ATCT and ADW SSC will coordinate the FAA Liaison (316
   OSS/OSAF) of unscheduled outages after notifying Potomac TRACON SOC. The FAA
   Liaison will ensure AM and other base flying units/airfield support agencies are made aware
   of the outage.
       1.29.2.1. ADW SSC will keep the FAA Liaison and/or AM apprised of status updates.
       1.29.2.2. Potomac TRACON SOC will contact AM for issuance of applicable NOTAMs.
   1.29.3. The FAA Liaison will ensure 316 OG/CC is informed of ATCALS outages.

                                       FLYING AREA

2.1. Local Flying Area/Designation of Airspace. Andrews AFB is located within the
Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA) and Flight Restricted
Zone (FRZ). (See Figure 2.1) The FAA classifies this area as „National Defense Airspace.‟
   2.1.1. Special Flight Rules Area (SFRA).
      2.1.1.1. The SFRA is a permanent Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) surrounding
      the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area. The SFRA extends 30 NM from Washington
      Reagan National Airport‟s DCA VOR (38° 51‟34” N / 77° 02‟ 11” W). The SFRA
      extends from the surface up to, but not including, 18,000 ft MSL (Flight Level [FL] 180).
      2.1.1.2. Within the SFRA, the ready identification, location, and control of aircraft is
      required in the interests of national security. All pilots must file a flight plan, establish
      two-way radio communications with air traffic control, and operate the aircraft
      transponder on the transponder code assigned by air traffic control. Refer to Washington
      ARTCC (KZDC) NOTAMs and FLIP for additional information.
   2.1.2. Flight Restricted Zone (FRZ).
      2.1.2.1. The FRZ is established within the SFRA and extends 13-15 NM from the DCA
      VOR. The altitude confines of the FRZ are the same as the SFRA.
      2.1.2.2. Flight operations within the FRZ are restricted to flights authorized by the FAA
      and the TSA. US military aircraft with prior FAA approval and DoD aircraft operating
      in/out of Andrews AFB are permitted in the FRZ.
      2.1.2.3. Federal, State, DoD Contract, and local government agencies with prior approval
      to operate in/out of Andrews AFB, a valid PPR issued by AM, and a valid TSA FRZ
      Airspace Waiver, may operate within the confines of the FRZ. Refer to Paragraph 8.18
      for more information concerning TSA FRZ Airspace Waivers and the Baltimore-
      Washington VFR Terminal Area Chart for more information on the SFRA and FRZ.

                                            Chapter 3

                      VISUAL FLIGHT RULES (VFR) PROCEDURES

3.1. VFR Weather Minimums. Except as noted below or if operating Special VFR (SVFR), no
person may operate an aircraft under VFR conditions when the flight visibility is less than 3 SM
and/or the ceiling is less than 1,000 ft. Additionally, aircraft operators must remain clear of
clouds during VFR conditions.
   3.1.1. Exceptions:
       3.1.1.1. Helicopters may be operated clear of clouds if operated at a speed that allows the
       pilot adequate opportunity to see any air traffic or obstruction in time to avoid a collision.
       3.1.1.2. When visibility is less than 3 SM, but not less than, 1 SM during night hours,
       fixed-wing aircraft may be operated clear of clouds if operated in Andrews AFB traffic
       pattern within ½ mile of the runway.
       3.1.1.3. Unless operating SVFR, no person may take-off or land an aircraft, or enter the
       traffic pattern, under VFR, within the lateral boundaries of the surface areas of Class B
       Airspace:
           3.1.1.3.1. Unless ground visibility at that airport is at least 3 SM; or
           3.1.1.3.2. If ground visibility is not reported at that airport, unless flight visibility
           during landing or take-off, or while operating in the traffic pattern is at least 3 SM.
Note: For the purpose of this section, an aircraft operating at the base altitude of a Class E
airspace area is considered to be within the airspace directly below that area.
3.2. VFR Traffic Patterns. VFR traffic patterns are depicted in Attachments 3 and 4. ATCT
may modify patterns to sequence and/or accommodate traffic.
   3.2.1. Deviations from established traffic patterns to accomplish special training shall be
   approved at the discretion of ATCT.
       3.2.1.1. ATCT will advise AM when the VFR traffic patterns are closed and reopened.
       3.2.1.2. Weather Requirements. Ceilings at or above 2,700 ft and visibility at or greater
       than 3 SM will be used as a standard for applying VFR separation in the Andrews Radar
       Pattern.
   3.2.2. Overhead Patterns. ATCT will de-conflict and protect the overhead pattern from other
   air traffic as needed based on current traffic conditions.
Note: Aircraft will not overfly the Base Hospital. “Carrier breaks” to Runway 01L/19R are not
allowed.
       3.2.2.1. Runway 01L/Runway 19L: pattern altitude 2,000 ft MSL; left turns.
       3.2.2.2. Runway 01R/Runway 19R: pattern altitude 2,000 ft MSL; right turns.
   3.2.3. Rectangular Traffic Patterns:
       3.2.3.1. Runway 01L/Runway 19L: left traffic; pattern altitude 1,500 ft MSL.

        3.2.3.2. Runway 01R/Runway 19R: right traffic; pattern altitude 1,500 ft MSL.
     3.2.4. Simulated Flameout (SFO) Patterns. Refer to Attachments 6 and 7. SFOs are only
     authorized for 121 FS (113 WG) aircraft IAW LOA between 316 WG, 113 WG, ATCT, and
     Potomac TRACON.
        3.2.4.1. SFOs are authorized only between sunrise and sunset.
        3.2.4.2. The following weather conditions must exist prior to the approval of a SFO
        pattern:
            3.2.4.2.1. For entry into the SFO pattern, a reported ceiling at Andrews AFB of:
1.      High Key: 7,800 ft ceiling or greater
2.      Low Key: 5,300 ft ceiling or greater
            3.2.4.2.2. Ground and flight visibility of 5 SM or more.
            3.2.4.2.3. High Key is defined as that point directly over the airport (KADW) at an
            altitude of 7,000 ft MSL. Low Key is defined as that position on a high downwind
            leg just prior to turning onto base leg; altitude is 4,500 ft MSL.
     3.2.5. Light Aircraft Patterns:
        3.2.5.1. Runway 01L/Runway 01R: left traffic; pattern altitude 1,000 ft MSL.
        3.2.5.2. Runway 19L/Runway 19R: right traffic; pattern altitude 1,000 ft MSL.
     3.2.6. Practice Approaches. Before starting their turn, fixed-wing aircraft making a touch-
     and-go or missed approach will proceed to Suitland Parkway (Runway 01L/Runway 01R) or
     proceed to a point abeam the base lake (Runway 19L/Runway 19R).
3.3. VFR Helicopter Operations.
     3.3.1. Helicopter departures from Non-Movement Areas.
        3.3.1.1. With ATCT approval, helicopters are permitted to depart from any area of the
        airdrome. Precautions must be taken to minimize FOD dispersal. The aircrew is
        responsible for maintaining separation from aircraft, vehicles, personnel and AGE when
        departing from areas outside the confines of the CMA.
        3.3.1.2. Present-position take-offs/arrivals from 1 HS parking areas are authorized IAW
        with LOA between 1 HS and ATCT.
     3.3.2. Helicopters operating on Taxiway Whiskey will give way to all fixed-wing aircraft
     unless otherwise instructed by ATCT. TA vehicles providing Follow-Me services to
     transient aircraft are not required to coordinate CMA access/movement with ATCT.
     Helicopters operating on Taxiway Whiskey must remain vigilant and scan for these vehicles.
     3.3.3. Helicopter Weather Minimums. VFR helicopter operations within the Washington
     Area Class B Airspace are authorized when ceilings are at or greater than 1,000 ft and
     visibility at least 3 SM. When ceilings are below 1,000 ft and/or visibility is less than 3 SM,
     Special VFR operations may be conducted.
     3.3.4. Helicopter Traffic Patterns: Traffic pattern altitude for all landing areas at Andrews
     AFB is 800 ft MSL downwind and 600 ft MSL base leg. Deviations from any traffic pattern
     (i.e. at or below 1,200 ft MSL for turning auto rotations) or route (i.e. inside downwind for
ANDREWSAFBI13-204 10 NOVEMBER 2010                                                             45


     turning auto rotations or wide patterns for a formation flight) must be approved by ATCT.
     Refer to Attachment 5 for additional information.
     3.3.5. Helicopter Transition Areas. Transitions/emergency procedure training, inclusive of
     auto rotations, will be conducted to/from the following areas (listed in order of priority):
1.     Either runway
2.     Northern portion of Taxiway Whiskey
3.     Southern portion of Taxiway Whiskey
4.     Bear‟s Den
5.     Naval Yard
6.     Other areas (i.e. Navy Trim Pad, South Pad, etc.) when authorized by ATCT and all other
  precautions have been taken
     3.3.6. Use of Runways as Transition Areas.
        3.3.6.1. If Runway 01R/19L is used, transition patterns will be flown as depicted in
        Attachment 5 unless early turnouts are made.
        3.3.6.2. Early turnouts will be made prior to NAF-Washington Operations (Building
        3198) for Runway 19L and Pearl Harbor Drive for Runway 01R.
     3.3.7. Helicopter Functional Check Flights (FCFs). FCFs that cannot be accomplished on
     the airfield will be conducted between ADW VORTAC R-160 and R-190 extending to the 20
     DME arc outside of Andrews Class B Airspace.
     3.3.8. Helicopter Slide Operations. Helicopters may use the first 1,500 ft of all runways for
     slide landings IAW LOA between ATCT, 1 HS and 316 OG.
     3.3.9. 1 HS Arrival/Departure Frequency Changes. To reduce frequency changes between 1
     HS aircraft and ATCT, the following procedures are in effect:
        3.3.9.1. Departures. 1 HS pilots will contact Local (Tower) Control on VHF 118.4 /UHF
        349.0 prior to entering the CMA for departure. The Local Controller will coordinate with
        Ground Control for aircraft entry in the CMA. Due to varying air traffic volume, a small
        delay may be experienced.
        3.3.9.2. Arrivals. After landing, 1 HS aircrew will remain on Local Control (Tower)
        frequency (VHF 118.4/UHF 349.0) for taxi instructions to parking.
3.4. Use of Runways as Transition Areas.
     3.4.1. Runway 01R/19L. Transition patterns will be flown as depicted in Attachments 3 and
     4 unless early turnouts are made. Early turnouts will be made before Pearl Harbor Drive
     (Runway 01R) and NAFW Operations (Building 3198) (Runway 19L).
     3.4.2. Runway 01L/19R. Early turnouts will not be conducted unless otherwise instructed
     by ATCT.
3.5. Reduced Same Runway Separation Procedures. Reduced Same Runway Separation
Standards are only authorized for 113 WG F-16 aircraft and shall not be reduced below those
minima outlined in the FAA JO 7110.65, except as outlined in Paragraph 3.5.1.

Note: Reduced same runway separation shall not be applied to other Andrews AFB tenant
aircraft, transient aircraft, or TDY units without consent from the 316th Wing. In such cases, a
signed agreement between the 316th Wing, the requesting unit, and ATCT shall be executed.
   3.5.1. Reduced Same Runway Separation shall not be reduced below those minima outlined
   in FAA JO 7110.65 except as follows:
       3.5.1.1. Affected aircrew or the ATCT controller may refuse to apply reduced separation
       standards.
       3.5.1.2. The minima outlined in Paragraphs 3.5.2.-3.5.8. shall not be utilized when
       reports or RCR for the affected runway indicate the braking action is either “POOR” or
       “NIL.”
       3.5.1.3. The minima outlined in Paragraphs 3.5.2.-3.5.8. shall not be reduced below
       6,000 ft when reports or RCR for the affected runway indicate the runway is “WET” or
       the braking action is “FAIR.”
       3.5.1.4. All aircraft must maintain a minimum of 500 ft lateral or vertical separation
       when flying over aircraft on the runway. Responsibility for separation rests with the
       pilot.
Note: Reduced Same Runway Separation procedures do not apply to aircraft operating within a
formation flight. Formation flights are controlled as a single aircraft until individual control is
requested. Transition of an arriving formation flight to individual control does not normally
occur until the elements of the formation flight reach the departure end of the runway, unless
otherwise requested. Separation responsibility between aircraft within the formation during
transition to individual control rests with the pilots concerned until standard separation has been
attained.
   3.5.2. The minimum reduced runway separation standard is 3,000 ft between similar aircraft
   (e.g., F-16 to F-16) and 6,000 ft between dissimilar aircraft (e.g., F-16 to F-15). When the
   preceding aircraft are landing in flight formation, 6,000 ft shall also be applied with the
   succeeding aircraft.
   3.5.3. At night, 6,000 ft is the minimum separation for all operations provided the ATCT
   controllers can determine distances using suitable landmarks; otherwise standard separation
   IAW FAA JO 7110.65 shall be applied.
   3.5.4. The following similar aircraft types are authorized 3,000 ft reduced same runway
   separation:
       3.5.4.1. Full stop behind a full stop, low approach, or touch and go.
       3.5.4.2. Touch and go behind a touch and go, or low approach.
       3.5.4.3. Low approach behind a low approach.
   3.5.5. Similar type aircraft operations are authorized 6,000 ft reduced same runway
   separation for a low approach behind a full stop.
   3.5.6. Reduced same runway separation is not authorized for similar type aircraft conducting
   a low approach behind a touch and go.

5.1. Operation of the Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS).
   5.1.1. PCAS use is governed by FAA JO 7110.65 and locally-developed AM Operating
   Instruction (AMOI). The PCAS is activated by ATCT. ATCT will test the PCAS daily at
   0800L. If any station fails to respond to the test or any subsequent activation, AM will be
   notified. ATCT will advise AM when the station becomes operational.
Note: ATCT will activate the PCAS for every emergency, even though emergency equipment
may already be positioned on the airfield.
   5.1.2. Primary stations located on the net are:        Fire/Crash Station; AM; Hospital; and
   Security Forces (listen only, no transmit).
   5.1.3. Activation. ATCT initiates PCAS activation. At a minimum, ATCT will activate the
   PCAS when any of the following conditions exist:

       correspond via direct line.
       5.1.7.3. Secure the PCAS/SCN when instructed to by ATCT or AM.
   5.1.8. ATCT responsibilities. ATCT shall:
       5.1.8.1. Activate the PCAS and notify appropriate agencies of any observed in-flight or
       ground emergency that they observe or are otherwise informed of by any other base
       agency.
       5.1.8.2. Upon activating the PCAS, expect Fire Department and AM vehicles to take
       appropriate actions and proceed to the emergency location or designated Fire Department
       ready-response staging location(s).
       5.1.8.3. Coordinate with/inform all taxiing or landing aircraft that will be impacted that
       the Fire Department/AM will/may be utilizing portions of the controlled movement area.
       Advise aircraft to use caution and if necessary have them hold until all equipment has
       passed their position and further aircraft movement will not interfere with the emergency
       response operation.
       5.1.8.4. Give priority to all emergency-associated vehicles crossing runways en route to
       an emergency. This shall be done even though it requires landing traffic to go around or
       departures to be delayed.
       5.1.8.5. Coordinate/approve vehicle access for crossing the non-affected runway and
       establish a plan to allow emergency response vehicles to proceed on the runway in use
       after the IFE aircraft has landed.
       5.1.8.6. Advise the Fire Chief (call sign: CHIEF 74 BRAVO) and the IFE aircraft to
       change to a designated discrete frequency (e.g. 125.35). CHIEF 74 BRAVO will return
       the designated discrete frequency back to the ATCT when communications with the
       emergency aircraft are no longer required.
       5.1.8.7. Provide directions to the scene of the emergency if the location is not readily
       observed by vehicles.
       5.1.8.8. In the event of an aircraft accident or catastrophic event within the controlled
       movement area, cease airfield operations and allow all emergency response agencies to
       proceed to the accident scene.
Note: In the event that the airfield is closed due to an aircraft accident or catastrophic mishap
within the controlled movement area, Andrews AFB‟s alert mission will launch as expeditiously
as possible. AM personnel/vehicles responding to the emergency shall coordinate with ATCT
and attempt to clear ground vehicles from the alert aircraft‟s path.
   5.1.9. 316 CES Fire Department responsibilities. Fire department shall:
       5.1.9.1. Notify ATCT if/when receiving a 911 call or other notification that will require
       an immediate response to the airfield. Once the pertinent information has been relayed,
       ATCT will activate the PCAS and relay the appropriate information.
       5.1.9.2. After receiving a PCAS notification regarding an IFE or an airfield emergency
       response, proceed as necessary onto the airfield in accordance with the Emergency
ANDREWSAFBI13-204 10 NOVEMBER 2010                                                          55


       Response Vehicle Staging Plan (see Figure 5.1), but do not cross any runway. Fire
       Department vehicles will hold short of all runways and CHIEF 74 BRAVO or the
       appointed designee will request permission for access onto the runway.
       5.1.9.3. CHIEF 74 BRAVO or the appropriate designee is responsible for positioning
       emergency vehicles responding to an alert.
Note: ATCT shall not attempt to position these vehicles.
       5.1.9.4. CHIEF 74 BRAVO, the Fire Chief, or the appointed designee will serve as the
       vehicle marshal and report to ATCT after all of the vehicles are in place for the
       emergency response. All communications with ATCT affecting emergency response
       vehicle movement will occur between CHIEF 74 BRAVO and the Ground Controller on
       the Ground Control Frequency until advise to change to the designated discrete frequency
       (e.g. 125.35).
       5.1.9.5. CHIEF 74 BRAVO will request access onto or permission to cross the non-
       emergency runway and report off the runway accordingly. CHIEF 74 BRAVO (or
       appointed designee) will serve as the sole radio response agent for
       communicating/relaying instructions between ATCT and the Fire department vehicles.
       Fire Department response vehicles will not cross any runway without proper permission.
       In addition response vehicles will correctly read back instructions to the controller.

Table 5.1. Proper Runway Permissions.
 SCENARIO: CHIEF 74 BRAVO will request permission to cross/enter the appropriate
 runway(s). ATCT will approve the request or instruct the vehicles to “Hold Short” of the
 applicable runway. CHIEF 74 BRAVO will repeat the instructions as stated by ATCT. CHIEF
 74 BRAVO will not move until after the instructions have been read back to ATCT.

       Ambulances will be summoned into the controlled movement area as directed by CHIEF
       74 BRAVO. CHIEF 74 BRAVO will coordinate these actions with ATCT prior to
       moving the ambulance from the staging area outside of the controlled movement area.
   5.1.10. AM responsibilities. AM shall:
       5.1.10.1. Respond to the airfield upon receiving notification via the PCAS. AM will
       monitor the airfield and runway conditions throughout the course of the emergency
       response.
       5.1.10.2. Hold short of all runways after being dispatched to the airfield. AM will
       request access to cross or proceed onto the runway(s) after the Fire Department receives
       approval to proceed for initial evaluation. Once the Senior Fire Officer determines that
       the area is safe, AM will be allowed to proceed in order to evaluate the situation.
       5.1.10.3. Inspect the emergency runway and any affected portions of the airfield
       following the termination of the emergency by the Fire Department. AM will notify
       ATCT that the runway(s) are re-opened to normal operations after conducting a thorough
       inspection of the emergency runway and any affected portion of the airfield.
Note: AM is the only agency that will be authorized to re-open the airfield or affected runway.
The Fire Department terminates emergencies, but AM is the final authority on runway/airfield
status.

Note 2: Unless otherwise specified by instruction, the Fire Chief or ranking fire department
official will be designated as the on-scene commander.
   5.3.1. Runway 01R/19L is designated the primary runway for recovering aircraft
   experiencing an emergency. Runway 01L/19R will only be used for emergencies when the
   nature of the emergency, field conditions, and supervisory personnel (ATCT or AM)
   determine it to be more suitable.
   5.3.2. Emergency Termination Procedures.
       5.3.2.1. ATCT may terminate an emergency if an airborne aircraft is able to resolve the
       cause for emergency declaration and can proceed safely on course, requiring no
       assistance or priority handling. In all other cases not specified below, the Fire Chief will
       advise ATCT when an emergency is terminated.
       5.3.2.2. CHIEF 74 BRAVO or the appropriate designee will terminate the IFE or airfield
       emergency and return to the fire station after contacting ATCT Ground Control for a
       proper vehicle clearance.
       5.3.2.3. AM will inspect the site and/or the runways and determine when they are open
       for continued operation.
Note: CHIEF 74 BRAVO will only determine when the emergency response is terminated and
all emergency operations are complete.
       5.3.2.4. ATCT may terminate emergency alerts on those aircraft that are airborne and
       advise they will proceed on course after having resolved a declared emergency. CHIEF
       74 BRAVO will advise ATCT when to terminate emergencies in all other cases.
   5.3.3. Hung Ordnance procedures (Refer to Paragraph 5.10) will be de-conflicted with the
   113 WG SOF and ATCT.
   5.3.4. ATCT responsibilities. ATCT shall:
       5.3.4.1. Afford priority to helicopters responding to an emergency.
       5.3.4.2. Use the PCAS to relay additional information that was not issued during the
       initial PCAS activation. Refer to Paragraph 5.1 for more information concerning
       operation of the PCAS.
       5.3.4.3. Advise AM whenever an aircraft is disabled on the landing area or taxiways.
       5.3.4.4. Activate the PCAS to request standby assistance when an aircraft reports “Hot
       Brakes.”
       5.3.4.5. Notify the Fire Department and AM when an aircraft requests a taxi clearance
       and advises they have dangerous/hazardous cargo on board.
5.4. In-Flight/Ground Emergency Procedures. ATCT will advise AM whenever an aircraft
becomes disabled on either runway or any taxiway.           ATCT will suspend affected
runway/taxiway operations until AM notifies ATCT that runway operations may be resumed.

ANDREWSAFBI13-204 10 NOVEMBER 2010                                                               59


   5.5.1. Primary Jettison Area. The primary area is defined as a point over the Chesapeake
   Bay on the Andrews VORTAC (ADW) R-125 25 DME fix at the intersection of the ADW
   R-125 and the Patuxent VORTAC (PXT) R-010.
   5.5.2. Alternate Jettison Area. The alternate area is that portion of Andrews AFB Airfield
   located between the runways north of Taxiway Sierra and south of the ADW VORTAC.
   This area is for emergency use only. (See also Attachment 2)
       5.5.2.1. Procedures. Pilots will notify ATC of the nature of the emergency and
       requirement to jettison.
       5.5.2.2. Every precaution should be taken to ensure that surface vessels and or other
       property are not endangered.
       5.5.2.3. Jettison procedures will be in accordance with the appropriate aircraft technical
       orders.
   5.5.3. Jettisoning under Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). Aircraft with sufficient
   fuel will notify ATCT or Washington Approach/Departure Control of the necessity to jettison
   external fuels or cargo and will proceed to the primary area.
       5.5.3.1. External stores, fuel or cargo will be jettisoned at the 25 NM fix while
       proceeding outbound on ADW R-125. Jettison altitude and procedures are dictated in
       respective aircraft flight manuals.
       5.5.3.2. If an extreme emergency situation precludes use of the primary jettison area, the
       pilot may elect to use the alternate area. External stores will be released at an altitude of
       800 ft MSL while on a heading parallel to the runways. When heading southbound,
       jettison immediately after passing the ADW VORTAC. When heading northbound,
       jettison immediately after passing Taxiway Sierra. Cargo jettison will be accomplished
       similarly except that altitude and air speed will be IAW applicable aircraft operating
       procedures and performance data.
Note: Fuel will not be jettisoned on base.
   5.5.4. Jettisoning under Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC):
       5.5.4.1. In IMC, pilots will obtain clearance from Washington Center or Washington
       Approach/Departure Control to proceed to the primary jettison area. Altitude will be as
       assigned by the controlling facility (altitude should be as low as possible to keep impact
       within the designated area). Radar vectors to the jettison area may be requested.
       5.5.4.2. When the situation (VMC or IMC) precludes use of the primary area to jettison
       fuel, the pilot will not jettison below an altitude of 8,000 ft AGL, when practical. Should
       weather or emergency conditions dictate jettisoning at a lower altitude, every effort must
       be made to avoid populated areas.
       5.5.4.3. The AOF/CC will notify the following agencies whenever stores or cargo is
       jettisoned in Chesapeake Bay:
           5.5.4.3.1. Operations Officer, NAS Patuxent River, Government Interdepartmental
           Code 131.
           5.5.4.3.2. Duty Officer, 5th US Coast Guard District.

5.7. Hot Brake Areas and Procedures. (See Attachment 2).
   5.7.1. Location. The Hot Brakes Areas at Andrews AFB are designated as the outermost
   eastern edges of Pads 13 and 93, and the outermost western edges of Pads 12 and 92. E-4
   Aircraft Hot Brakes areas are the outermost western edges of Pads 14 and 94.
   5.7.2. Procedures. When a pilot reports hot brakes, they will be instructed to taxi to the
   appropriate Hot Brakes Area. If the Hot Brakes area is already occupied, the pilot will be
   directed to the nearest location that will isolate the aircraft from other traffic and cause the
   least operational impact.
       5.7.2.1. The Senior Fire/Crash Official will determine when the aircraft brakes/wheels
       have cooled sufficiently to permit the aircraft to be towed or taxied to designated parking
       spot.
       5.7.2.2. If the aircraft has taxied to parking, the situation will be treated as a Ground
       Emergency and the aircraft will hold its position. The Senior Fire/Crash Official will
       determine if the aircraft should be moved.
5.8. Abandonment of Aircraft (Controlled Bail-Out, Ejection, Plotting Aircraft
Coordinates). The aircraft abandonment/bailout location is the off the Nottingham VOR-DME
(OTT) R-120 4 DME. When the preplanned abandonment of a disabled aircraft becomes
necessary, the pilot must ensure maximum safety to lives and property on the ground. Pilots will
advise ATCT or Potomac TRACON of their intentions to abandon their aircraft. ATCT will
activate the PCAS when operationally dictated. Vectoring to OTT R-120 4 DME may be
provided by ATC due to high traffic congestion in this area.
Note: ATCT will initiate emergency response by activating the PCAS. AM will activate the
SCN and plot the coordinates using the Crash Grid Map located at the AM Counter.
5.9. Personnel/Crash Locator Beacon Signal/Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT)
Response Procedures.
   5.9.1. Upon notification of an ELT, AM will notify appropriate agencies per the applicable
   QRC.
   5.9.2. If the source of the ELT is not located after 1 hour, AM will notify the Air Force
   Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC) at Tyndall AFB, FL (1-800-851-3051).
5.10. Hung Ordnance Procedures.
   5.10.1. Landing aircraft will exit at the runway end, regardless of landing runway, and abide
   by procedures outlined in Paragraph 1.15
   5.10.2. Aircraft will remain on the taxiway until Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)
   personnel render armaments/ordnance safe.
5.11. Wind Limitations on Control Tower. ATCT will evacuate when winds exceed 60 knots.

       Snow Control Center (ASCC) located in Building 1220.
Note: ATCT will notify AM prior to facility evacuation.
       5.12.1.2. While in the alternate facility, ATCT will be operating “ATC Zero.” ATCT is
       only able to provide basic VFR services; they are unable to provide IFR services. If
       IMC, Potomac TRACON will assume responsibility of Andrews Class B airspace until
       ATCT reports VMC conditions or ATCT personnel resume normal facility operations.
       5.12.1.3. ATCT is unable to activate the PCAS in the alternate facility. ATCT will rely
       on AM to active the SCN in lieu of the PCAS if required.
       5.12.1.4. If ATCT is unable to evacuate to the ASCC (e.g. Building 1220 is evacuated),
       ATCT will notify Potomac TRACON; TRACON will assume responsibility of Andrews
       Class B airspace.
   5.12.2. AM facility evacuation.
       5.12.2.1. AM personnel will relocate to Hangar 2 (DYNCORP TA) IAW all procedures

8.17. Civilian Aircraft Operations. Except for emergency situations, civilian/general aviation
aircraft are not authorized to land at Andrews AFB without prior approval of the installation
commander or designated representative.
   8.17.1. AFI10-1001 governs the use of USAF installations by civilian aircraft. Requests for
   civilian aircraft landing permits will be processed IAW AFI10-1001. TSA requirements will
   be met by the aircraft operator and TSA approval is independent of USAF Civil Aircraft
   Landing Permits. Refer to Paragraph 8.18 for more information regarding TSA FRZ
   Airspace Waivers.
   8.17.2. Unauthorized civil aircraft landings present a distinct security risk. If a pilot files a
   flight plan to, and lands at, a USAF installation without obtaining prior permission, the
   installation commander or designated representative may categorize the landing as
   unauthorized IAW AFI10-1001. 316 OSS/OSA will inform AFDW/A35 of any unauthorized
   landings, and ensure any applicable OPREPs are transmitted IAW AFI10-206 (e.g., national
   level interest, media coverage, etc.).
ANDREWSAFBI13-204 10 NOVEMBER 2010                                                              77


   8.17.3. If a civilian aircraft requests to land without prior permission, the ATCT
   Supervisor/Controller-In-Charge will coordinate with AM to determine if the aircraft will be
   authorized to land. If no landing authorization is received, the aircraft will be denied landing
   rights.
   8.17.4. If the pilot of a civilian aircraft declares an emergency and requests to land at
   Andrews AFB, ATCT Supervisor/Controller-In-Charge will allow the aircraft to land and
   notify AM. After landing, ATCT will direct the aircraft to exit the runway and hold position
   on Pad 14, Pad 94, or the Hot Cargo Pad (whichever is closest). After landing, ATCT will
   notify AM of the aircraft‟s location. If deemed necessary, ATCT will activate the Primary
   Crash Alarm System to notify appropriate agencies.
   8.17.5. If the pilot of a civilian aircraft does not declare an emergency and lands at Andrews
   AFB without authorization, ATCT Supervisor/Controller-In-Charge will initiate “Stop Alert”
   procedures. After landing, ATCT will direct the aircraft to exit the runway and hold position
   on Pad 14, Pad 94, or the Hot Cargo Pad (whichever is closest).
       8.17.5.1. In the event of a “Stop Alert” AM will:
          8.17.5.1.1. Dispatch at least one individual to the aircraft location and coordinate
          with Security Forces to obtain all appropriate information to file unauthorized landing
          paperwork.
          8.17.5.1.2. Notify BDOC and request they dispatch a security team to maintain
          security of the aircraft, crew and, if necessary, to conduct follow-on actions as
          directed by 316 OSS/OSA.
          8.17.5.1.3. Request TA dispatch a Follow-Me Vehicle to the aircraft location and
          standby to escort and/or park the aircraft.
          8.17.5.1.4. Once the interview is complete, the category of landing will be
          determined and appropriate landing fees will be assessed IAW AFI10-1001. The
          final report will be sent to AF/A3O-A via AFDW/A35.
8.18. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Flight Restricted Zone (FRZ)
Airspace Waivers. (Refer to Paragraph 2.1 for general information concerning the FRZ)
   8.18.1. All civilian aircraft requesting a civil aircraft landing permit at Andrews AFB
   (KADW) must also submit an application for TSA FRZ Airspace Waiver to the TSA Office
   of Airspace Waivers. TSA airspace waiver application procedures and instructions are
   available at:
http://www.tsa.gov/what_we_do/tsnm/general_aviation/dc_flight_restricted_zones.shtm
   8.18.2. Aircraft requiring a TSA airspace waiver prior to entering the DC FRZ surrounding
   Andrews AFB will submit a completed waiver application to the TSA Office of Airspace
   Waivers NLT 7 days (10 days preferred), prior to projected arrival date at Andrews AFB.
   All airspace waiver applications require 5-7 business days for processing.
Note: Any changes made to the waiver application once submitted to TSA will necessitate
completion of a new airspace waiver application and will incur lengthy processing delays.
   8.18.3. A valid PPR issued by AM does not alleviate a civil aircraft‟s TSA airspace waiver
   requirement. A PPR only allows aircraft to land at Andrews AFB, but not enter the
 78                                           ANDREWSAFBI13-204 10 NOVEMBER 2010


   SFRA/FRZ. AM will issue PPRs to aircraft without approved TSA airspace waivers, but will
   normally remind the aircrew to ensure they have an approved waiver prior to FRZ entry. The
   civilian aircraft charter aircrew/charter company is solely responsible for submitting an
   airspace waiver application to TSA Office of Airspace Waivers.
Note: Civilian aircraft, even those with a valid PPR issued by Andrews AM, without an
approved TSA airspace waiver will be denied entry into the FRZ and will be unable to land at
Andrews AFB.
8.19. Use of Airfield by Foreign Aircraft. AFI10-1801 governs the use and approval for
foreign aircraft at Andrews AFB.
   8.19.1. Normally, the scheduling agency for the aircraft contacts AF/A3O-A. The request
   normally originates from the Embassy to the State Department, then to AF/A3O-A.
   8.19.2. 316 OG/CC is the approving authority, through PPRs, for allowing foreign aircraft to
   land at Andrews AFB; this approval authority is delegated to the AOF/CC.
   8.19.3. Use of Andrews AFB for other than normal DV support to the national principal is
   staffed through 316 WG/XP. AM will inform AFDW/A35 of any requests received from
   AF/A3O-A for use of the airfield by foreign aircraft.
8.20. Civil Use of Military NAVAIDs. Civil aircraft are approved to use the Runway 01R/19L
ILS. All other NAVAIDs at Andrews AFB are owned and maintained by the FAA. This does
not imply use of the Runways or approve civil aircraft landing (non-emergency).
8.21. Aero Club/Flight Training Center Operations. Andrews AFB does not operate an Aero
Club/Base Flight Training Center. Aircraft owned by military aero clubs/flight training centers
desiring use of Andrews will adhere to standard PPR procedures.
8.22. Weather Dissemination and Coordination Procedures. Refer to AAFBI15-101,
Weather Support Procedures.
   8.22.1. Hazardous/Severe Weather notification            procedures (to include lightning
   advisories/warnings). When a weather warning or advisory is issued, AM shall execute the
   applicable quick reaction checklist and notify the following agencies:
       8.22.1.1. Aircrew Transportation.
       8.22.1.2. ATCT. ATCT shall advise all personnel working within the confines of the
       CMA to seek shelter.
       8.22.1.3. DYNCORP and T-Line TA. TA will advise personnel working on the airfield
       to seek shelter.
       8.22.1.4. NAOC (if on station).
       8.22.1.5. All agencies/personnel monitoring Ramp Net.
   8.22.2. Mission priorities and requirements vary; individuals units should develop tailored
   procedures regarding activity/operations on the airfield during inclement or hazardous
   weather.
8.23. Airfield Snow Removal Operations.
ANDREWSAFBI13-204 10 NOVEMBER 2010                                                             79


   8.23.1. 316 CES/CEO is the OPR for snow removal. The removal of snow and ice from the
   airfield will be accomplished in accordance with 316 WG OPLAN 9538, Snow and Ice
   Control Plan (FOUO).
   8.23.2. AM must be actively monitor snow removal activities, monitor snow berm/windrow
   heights, accomplish and report RCRs/RSCs as required, coordinate with 316 CES to mitigate
   airfield lighting/signage obscuration by snow and windrows, and issuing NOTAMs as
   conditions dictate.
Note: Established airfield priorities set in 316 WG OPLAN 9538 (FOUO) will be followed to
the maximum extent possible. Snow removal priorities are subject to alteration as mission
requirements dictate.
8.24. Bird/Wildlife Control and Local Bird Watch Conditions (BWC). BASH procedures
and Bird Watch Conditions (BWCs) for Andrews AFB are published in AAFBI91-212,
Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard Plan.
8.25. Supervisor of Flying (SOF) Operating from the Tower. The 316 WG does not function
with a SOF. FAA ATCT access and approvals are controlled by the FAA Tower Supervisor.
113 WG has a SOF for F-16 operations, contacted through the 113 WG/CP.
8.26. Taking of Photographs. Photography on the airfield is governed by AAFBI31-101,
Normal Security Operations (FOUO). All requests for photography by civilian agencies will be
referred to 316 WG/PA and must be prior-approved.
8.27. National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) Support. 316 WG/CP is the OPR for
NAOC support. Aircraft Parking Spot 13-A is reserved for Priority Level 1 missions. NAOC
may park on Row 1-B if Spot 13-A is unusable.
Note: During Presidential movements, NAOC aircraft (if on station) should not be parked on
Row 1 due to interference with helicopter operations in support of DV-1 missions.
8.28. Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE). When not in use, all AGE (to include fire
bottles) must be removed from the aircraft parking areas and stored in authorized storage areas
located away from aircraft. AGE/support equipment will not be in-place more than 3 hours prior
to aircraft arrival or more than 3 hours following aircraft departure.
8.29. Joint Airfield Working Group (JAWG). The complexity of the airfield environment,
diversity of tenant flying units and flying missions, and the impact of airfield construction
activities necessitates the need for the JAWG.
   8.29.1. The JAWG will convene as events, missions, and/or construction projects dictate, but
   will convene at least once per quarter. The JAWG is chaired by the AOF/CC. The AOF/CC
   will maintain and distribute minutes.
   8.29.2. Goals of the JAWG include:
       8.29.2.1. Assess airfield environmental concerns and formulating corrective actions;
       8.29.2.2. Discuss the impact of airfield construction activities and associated operational
       restrictions.
       8.29.2.3. Discuss upcoming airfield restrictions, runway/taxiway/ramp closures, special
       events, etc.

       8.29.2.4. Address ATC and airspace items, to include restrictions, National Special
       Security Events (NSSE), contingencies, etc.
       8.29.2.5. Solicit feedback, inputs, and addressing concerns from flying squadrons and
       airfield support agencies.
   8.29.3. JAWG membership. Refer to Table 8.4

Table 8.4. JAWG Membership.




8.30. Field Carrier Landing Practice (FCLP) (See Attachment 8). Navy and Marine Corps
units based at Andrews AFB may request FCLP patterns. Letters of Agreement between those
units, ATCT, and 316 OSS/OSA are required and regulate pattern use.
   8.30.1. Due to noise concerns, Runway 01R/19L will be used as the preferred carrier
   break/landing pattern, using the eastern portion of the airfield for pattern transition. Runway
   01L/19R may be used, however, all breaks shall be to the east.
   8.30.2. During FCLP operations, Runway 01R/19L will be closed to non-participating
   aircraft due to staged equipment in close proximity of the runway.
8.31. Unusual Aircraft Maneuvers. Pilots shall not conduct maneuvers that are not essential to
the performance of the aircraft (e.g., high-speed low approaches, practice airfield attacks, fly-
bys, etc.) without prior approval from 316 OG/CC. All requests to conduct unusual aircraft
maneuvers will be submitted to 316 OSS/OSA at least 1 week prior to the maneuver.
   8.31.1. ATCT will deny any pilot request to conduct unusual maneuvers including
   unnecessary low passes and unscheduled fly-bys.
   8.31.2. Requests for maneuvers that could potentially violate FARs must be submitted to
   316 OSS/OSA at least 60 days in advance to provide ample time for waiver coordination
ANDREWSAFBI13-204 10 NOVEMBER 2010                                                               81


     with the FAA. The installation commander or designated representative is the final
     approving authority.
8.32. Airfield Visual and Radio Blind Spots. (See Figure 8.1)
     8.32.1. Visual blind spots. There are six established visual blind spots on the airfield:
1.      201 AS Ramp
2.      Taxiway W-2 between the 201 AS Ramp and the Aero-Medical Staging Facility
3.      Western area of 113 WG Ramp
4.      113 WG ASA Facility
5.      Western area of PAG Compound
6.      Mission Support Facility Apron
     8.32.2. Radio blind spots. There are four know areas on the airfield where intermittent radio
     communications problems can be expected:
1.      Taxiway Echo (northeast corner) prior to reaching to the Runway 01R/19L VFR hold line
2.      Taxiway November between the runways
3.      Taxiway Whiskey (southwest corner) leading to Runway 01L/19R hold lines
4.      Immediate area in the vicinity of the Runway 01L/19R south overrun

Note: Radio blind spots are more prevalent when using handheld radios.

8.33. Foreign Object Debris/Damage (FOD).
   8.33.1. Upon entering the airfield from a non-paved surface, construction area, NAVAIDs
   Road, or observing a FOD checkpoint sign, personnel will stop vehicles prior to entering the
   movement area to perform a thorough FOD check.
Note: A FOD check consists of a visual inspection of: tires for any rocks/particles; loose
objects hanging from the vehicle undercarriage; and truck beds for any unsecured items that
could be dropped and possibly ingested by aircraft.
   8.33.2. Failure to perform a FOD check will result in immediate suspension of airfield
   driving privileges which a letter from the individual‟s unit commander for reinstatement
   (refer also to AAFBI13-213, Airfield Driving) and, if applicable, will result in cessation of
   construction until proper procedures are followed and/or retraining is accomplished.
   8.33.3. Special attention to FOD prevention is required by all vehicles entering and exiting
   active construction areas on the airfield. Contract personnel are required to perform FOD
   checks with oversight from the CES Escort Management Program escorts. Contract
   sweepers will normally be included in the Statement of Work and assist in FOD prevention
   along high traffic haul routes. Failure to conduct FOD checks will result in cessation of
   construction until proper procedures are followed and/or retraining is accomplished.
8.34. Ramp/Aircraft Freezes. Presidential, Vice-Presidential, and selected DV movements
mandate additional security protections on the airfield. Ramp/aircraft freeze procedures are
initiated during movements of selected executive personnel; US Secret Service is the approval
authority for ramp/aircraft freezes.
Note: Ramp/aircraft freeze procedures are contained in the Procedures and Restrictions During
DV Movements LOA on file with the US Secret Service, 316 WG/XP, 316 OSS/OSA and ATCT.
8.35. Quiet Hour/Period Procedures.
   8.35.1. Coordination:
       8.35.1.1. 316 OG/CC is the approval authority for Quiet Hour/Period requests.
Note: The Secret Service lead agent or Security Forces Detail Chief is the approval authority for
Quiet Hour/Period requests during ramp/aircraft freezes.
       8.35.1.2. Requestors will submit a Quiet Hour/Period Request Memorandum
       (Attachment 11) to AM NLT 5 duty days prior to requested Quiet Hour/Period
       timeframe. The AOF/CC or Airfield Manager will staff the request letter to 316 OG/CC
       for review and approval. 316 OG/CC will notify AM of approved Quiet Hour/Periods
       and specify applicable airfield/aircraft/air traffic restrictions necessary to maintain
       continuity of operations during the ceremony.
       8.35.1.3. Quiet Periods will be initiated/terminated as scheduled and published unless
       otherwise coordinated by 316 OSS/OSA. The US Secret Service representative in ATCT
       will perform this function for any Quiet Hour/Periods initiated by Secret Service or
       Security Forces for distinguished visitors.
   8.35.2. Following 316 OG/CC Quiet Hour/Period approval, AM will:
       8.35.2.1. Issue applicable NOTAMs.
ANDREWSAFBI13-204 10 NOVEMBER 2010                                                             83


       8.35.2.2. Notify the ATCT Watch Supervisor in advance of all Quiet Hours/Periods.
       8.35.2.3. Coordinate with 316 WG/CP and tenant Command Posts for notifications so
       engine tests/run-ups are terminated, aircraft/vehicle movements are restricted in
       designated areas, and aircrews are aware of restrictions and anticipated delays.
       8.35.2.4. Inform the ATCT Supervisor of any 316 OG/CC-approved Quiet Hour/Period
       exceptions/modifications.
       8.35.2.5. The ATCT Supervisor will ensure engine runs are terminated and aircraft and
       vehicle movements restricted/modified accordingly in the affected areas.
   8.35.3. Procedures.
       8.35.3.1. Standard West Side Quiet Hour/Period procedures/restrictions:
           8.35.3.1.1. No aircraft operations, engine runs, vehicle traffic, or support equipment
           operations will occur in the vicinity of Rows 10-12 (if Ceremony occurs in Hangar 3,
           or other location specified by NOTAM).
           8.35.3.1.2. Full stop landings only are permitted on Runway 01L/19R. Aircraft will
           minimize use of reverse thrust.
           8.35.3.1.3. Normal operations on Runway 01R/19L.
Note: Formation and/or afterburner departures are not permitted unless approved by 316 OG/CC
or necessary for alert scrambles. There are no restrictions to alert aircraft requiring use of
Runway 01L/19R.
       8.35.3.2. Standard East Side Quiet Hour/Period procedures/restrictions:
           8.35.3.2.1. No aircraft operations, engine runs, vehicle traffic, or support equipment
           operations will occur in the vicinity of the ceremony location (will be specified in
           NOTAM).
Note: These restrictions extend 500 ft either side of the ceremony location on the affected ramp.
           8.35.3.2.2. Runway 01R/19L operations are not authorized unless in direct support of
           the ceremony or deemed mission-essential by requesting agency and approved by
           316 OG/CC. No restrictions are placed on alert missions.
           8.35.3.2.3. Formation and/or afterburner departures are not authorized.
           8.35.3.2.4. Normal operations on Runway 01L/19R.
Note: Formation and/or afterburner departures on Runway 01L/19R are not permitted unless
approved by 316 OG/CC or necessary for alert scrambles.
       8.35.3.3. Quiet Hour/Period procedures/restrictions during single runway operations.
           8.35.3.3.1. Requests will be submitted to AM using the Quiet Hour/Period Request
           Memorandum (Attachment 9). Due to increased coordination and planning
           purposes, requests must be submitted to the AOF/CC, Airfield Manager or AM NLT
           10 days prior to the requested Quiet Hour/Period timeframe.
           8.35.3.3.2. IFR full stop arrivals are permitted; IFR departures are normally
           permitted for non-base assigned aircraft. 316 OSS/OSA will normally notify external
 84                                           ANDREWSAFBI13-204 10 NOVEMBER 2010


          flight planning cells (TACC, JOSAC, etc.) and advise them of upcoming Quiet
          Hour/Periods to minimize planned arrivals or departures during Quiet Hour/Periods.
          Base-assigned aircraft units projecting IFR departures during the Quiet Hour/Period
          will notify 316 OSS/OSA; 316 OG/CC, delegated to 316 OSS/CC, will review and
          approve on a case-by-case basis as missions dictate. Afterburner and/or formation
          departures are not authorized unless necessary for alert missions or approved by 316
          OG/CC. Arriving aircraft will minimize use of reverse thrust.
          8.35.3.3.3. Aircraft and vehicle ramp restrictions will vary based on location, but will
          normally adhere to restrictions outlined in Paragraph 8.35.3.1 for West Side Quiet
          Hours/Periods and Paragraph 8.35.3.2 for East Side Quiet Hours/Periods.
      8.35.3.4. Practice approaches/departures (including overhead patterns) are not authorized
      to either Runway during Quiet Hour/Periods.
      8.35.3.5. Additional restrictions or modifications to Quiet Period procedures can be
      imposed to support mission-essential operations (e.g., 121 FS F-16 departures on Runway
      01R/19L requiring barriers or alert scrambles relayed by 121 FS SOF).
      8.35.3.6. ATCT will modify aircraft taxi routes when practical to channel aircraft
      movement and engine noise away from the ceremony.
8.36. Airfield/Construction Coordination Requirements.
   8.36.1. Airfield activities such as air shows, quiet hours/periods, aerial demonstrations,
   exercises, deployments, “fun-runs,” crane operations, and construction projects, with a
   potential impact on airfield operations, must be coordinated in advance through the 316
   OSS/OSA.
   8.36.2. All airfield construction activities, crane activity, conducted by any Wing or tenant
   unit at Andrews AFB must be prior-coordinated with AM to ensure a safe airfield operating
   environment is maintained, appropriate NOTAMs are sent, and associated airfield restrictions
   are in place and affected units are made aware.
   8.36.3. Crane Operations.
      8.36.3.1. All crane operations on Andrews AFB, regardless of location on base, must be
      coordinated through the 316 CES Community Planner (316 CES/CEAO) a minimum of
      30 days prior to the requested operation. This is to ensure an FAA-approved Form 7460-
      1, Notice of Proposed Construction or Alteration, is completed. This form is required by
      the FAA, as outlined in FAR Part 77, Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace.
      8.36.3.2. Once the Form 7460-1 is approved, 316 OSS/OSA must be notified no later
      than 5 days prior to any crane operation to ensure flying operations are not impacted.
      7460-1 Forms are also submitted to AMC/A3AP for Terminal Instrument Procedures
      (TERPS) review to ensure proposed crane operations do not adversely impact instrument
      procedures. If necessary, AMC/A3AP will ensure applicable NOTAMs are sent.
      8.36.3.3. When the approved FAA Form 7460-1 is returned to the requester, a copy must
      be sent to 316 CES/CEAO and 316 OSS/OSA.
ANDREWSAFBI13-204 10 NOVEMBER 2010                                                            85


       8.36.3.4. Failure to coordinate crane operations may result in suspension of operations
       until approved. A fine of $1,000/day per violation can be assessed for violations pursuant
       to 49 U.S.C. 46301 (a)(2005).
   8.36.4. Airfield Construction Coordination.
       8.36.4.1. The Base Civil Engineer (BCE) ensures that coordination and clearances are
       obtained from 316 OSS/OSA prior to beginning any construction or repair activities on
       the airfield.
       8.36.4.2. Final approval requires a completed temporary airfield construction waiver
       signed by 316 WG/CC, ORM Assessment, pre-construction meeting between
       stakeholders (i.e., 316 OSS/OSA, 316 CES, 316 WG/SE, FAA, etc.) to determine
       construction requirements and assess the operational impact to flying missions, and any
       other construction waivers and FAA notifications be processed.
       8.36.4.3. Partner units, Resident Office in Charge of Constructions (ROICC), Navy
       Public Works, Army Corps of Engineer, etc. must coordinate all construction projects
       and repairs on the airfield with their host unit base Civil Engineer and notify 316
       OSS/OSA when work begins. This coordination is necessary to integrate all construction
       on the airfield into a comprehensive plan to reduce the operational impact on flying
       operations.
       8.36.4.4. 744 CS will provide AM with a project review of all communications
       initiatives performed on the airfield prior to construction
           8.36.4.4.1. 744 CS will ensure contractor leads report the status of airfield
           construction activities each morning to AM, prior to commencing work on the
           airfield.
           8.36.4.4.2. AM will advise 744 CS on airfield status, to include ramp freezes or
           unusual activities that could affect work on the airfield. AM will document
           coordination on AF IMT 3616.
