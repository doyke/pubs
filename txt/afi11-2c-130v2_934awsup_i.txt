     1.9.2. Qualification (QUAL) Evaluation. All C-130 crewmembers will successfully
     complete a periodic qualification evaluation. The flight phase will evaluate aircrew
     performance and the application of flight manual procedures and maneuvers. Weapon
     System Trainers (WSTs) with a C or greater certification may be used to accomplish this
     evaluation. The ground phase includes the following requisites: open-book and closed-book
     examinations, Boldface examination, and an Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE).
AFI11-2C-130V2_934AWSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                    7


  Navigators are also required to complete an open-book written instrument examination IAW
  AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Course Program.
  1.9.3. Mission (MSN) Evaluations. All mission qualified C-130 crewmembers will
  successfully complete a periodic mission evaluation. The MSN evaluation may be
  accomplished in conjunction with INSTM and/or QUAL evaluations (e.g.,
  INSTM/QUAL/MSN or QUAL/MSN). Mission evaluation profiles should be as realistic as
  possible and relate to real-world applications. Flight events should correlate to the crew
  member’s highest capabilities. The ground phase includes the following requisites: open-
  book examination, tactics open-book examination, boldface examination, and an emergency
  procedures evaluation (EPE).
     1.9.3.1. Unit baseline qualifications. Units will establish in their local guidance the
     baseline qualifications that crewmembers must hold to be considered Mission Ready in
     their unit’s mission. Mission evaluation profiles will be built to sample these
     qualifications. See Chapter 2, Chapter 3, Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 of this instruction
     for required items that must be evaluated. Any crewmember that maintains a
     qualification level below this baseline will have restrictions listed on their “MSN” AF
     IMT 8. For example, “RESTRICTIONS: Will not perform airdrop operations.”
     1.9.3.2. For units/aircrew with an airdrop requirement, mission evaluations for all crew
     positions should include an actual airdrop load, if possible. For units/aircrew with a
     NVG requirement, MSN evaluations for all crew positions should be at night utilizing
     NVGs if scheduling permits.
  1.9.4. Instructor (INSTR) Evaluations. To initially qualify as an instructor in the C-130,
  crewmembers will successfully complete an initial instructor qualification course and
  evaluation. Subsequently, aircrew members designated as instructors will be evaluated on
  their ability to instruct during all periodic evaluations. Crewmembers may use their initial
  instructor evaluation to satisfy the requirements of a periodic evaluation provided all
  evaluation requirements for the periodic evaluation are met.
  1.9.5. SPOT Evaluations. See AFI 11-202V2.
  1.9.6. Re-qualification (RQ). Use the prefix RQ IAW AFI 11-202V2.
  1.9.7. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE). Use AFI 11-202V2 and the following:
  Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of emergency procedures and aircraft systems for
  all initial, re-qualification, and periodic QUAL and MSN evaluations. The EPE will include
  areas commensurate with the examinee’s graduated training (e.g., initial, line, instructor, or
  evaluator). See specific crew position chapters of this AFI for EPE requirements.
     1.9.7.1. Group Standardization and Evaluation office (OG/OGV) will develop and
     maintain a list of EPE program requirements (topics, special interest, etc.). OG/OGV
     will also develop an EPE guide for each crew position detailing the evaluation areas and
     conduct of the EPE. EPEs shall emphasize emergency procedures and systems
     knowledge. Examiners may use one continuous scenario throughout the EPE, or use
     different scenarios as required to ensure appropriate areas are evaluated.
     1.9.7.2. Simulated emergencies will not be evaluated during critical phases of flight (low
     level flight and airdrop). This does not preclude simulated emergencies being performed
 8                                      AFI11-2C-130V2_934AWSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


        in the traffic pattern. If available, conduct an EPE in a simulator, Weapon System Trainer
        (WST) or Aircrew Training Device (ATD). If not available, the EPE will be verbally
        evaluated.
        1.9.7.3. Examinees may use publications that are normally available in-flight.           The
        examinee must recite, perform, or write all Boldface items.
        1.9.7.4. Examinees receiving an overall EPE grade of unqualified will be placed in
        supervised status until recommended additional training and re-evaluation are completed.
        Examinees receiving an overall EPE grade of unqualified because of unsatisfactory
        Boldface procedures will not be permitted to fly in their aircrew position until a
        successful re-evaluation is accomplished. Accomplish additional training IAW AFI 11-
        202V2.
1.10. Grading Policies. See AFI 11-202V2, Chapter 5, Grading Policies, and the following.
     1.10.1. When in-flight evaluation of a required area is not possible, the area may be verbally
     evaluated or evaluated in an ATD unless otherwise noted in this AFI. Flight examiners will
     make every effort to evaluate all required areas in-flight before resorting to this provision. If
     an alternate method is used to complete the evaluation, document in the Additional
     Comments portion of the AF IMT 8. Use of this provision must be approved by the
     examinee’s commander. The commander’s signature on the AF IMT 8 acknowledges this
     provision has been approved.
1.11. Grading System. See AFI 11-202V2, Chapter 5, Grading System, and the following.
     1.11.1. Critical Areas. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the aircrew
     member in order to successfully achieve the mission objectives. If an aircrew member
     receives an unqualified grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will
     also be unqualified. Critical areas are identified by “(Critical)” in the area title and shading
     of the Q- block on the AF IMT 3862, Flight Evaluation Worksheet. See examples at
     Attachment 3, Attachment 4, Attachment 5, and Attachment 6.
     1.11.2. Crew Resource Management (CRM). If CRM is downgraded during the evaluation,
     the evaluator will also complete an AF IMT 4031, CRM Skills Criteria Training/Evaluation.
     The completed IMT will be forwarded to OG/OGV, for inclusion in quarterly trends, and
     wing training so that the data can be passed to the MAJCOM CRM program manager.
1.12. Conduct of Evaluations.
     1.12.1. Flight examiners will pre-brief the examinee on the conduct, purpose, requirements
     of the evaluation, and all applicable evaluation criteria. Flight examiners will then evaluate
     the examinee in each graded area/sub area.
        1.12.1.1. Flight examiners will normally not evaluate personnel they have primarily
        trained, recommended for upgrade, or who write their effectiveness/performance reports.
        1.12.1.2. (Added-934AW) Evaluators will process flight evaluation paperwork in
        accordance with the Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) Processing Checklist located in the
        individuals Temporary Flight Evaluation Folder (TFEF).
        1.12.1.3. (Added-934AW) Evaluators will conduct Emergency Procedures Evaluations
        (EPE) using the Emergency Procedures Checklist located in the individuals TFEF.
AFI11-2C-130V2_934AWSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                      9


      1.12.1.4. (Added-934AW) Evaluators will brief examinees prior to their flight
      evaluation using the Evaluator Briefing Guide located in the individuals TFEF.
   1.12.2. Unless otherwise specified, flight examiners may conduct the evaluation in any seat
   or position that best enables them to observe the examinee’s performance. Simulator/ATS
   contractors will not be in the seat during evaluations in the WST/ATD.
   1.12.3. Evaluators will note discrepancies and deviations from prescribed tolerances and
   performance criteria during the evaluation. They will compare the examinee’s performance
   with the tolerances provided in the grading criteria and assign an appropriate grade for each
   area.
      1.12.3.1. An evaluation will not be changed to a training mission to avoid documenting
      substandard performance, nor will a training mission be changed to an evaluation.
      1.12.3.2. The judgment of the flight examiner, guidance provided in AFI 11-202V2, and
      this instruction will be the determining factors in assigning an overall qualification level
      on the AF IMT 8. The flight examiner will thoroughly critique all aspects of the flight.
      During the critique, the flight examiner will review the examinee’s overall rating, specific
      deviations, area/sub area grades assigned, and any additional training required.
      1.12.3.3. In the event of unsatisfactory performance, the flight examiner will determine
      additional training requirements. Required additional training will not be accomplished
      on the same flight. EXCEPTION: Required additional training on the same flight is
      allowed when unique situations presenting valuable training opportunities (e.g.
      thunderstorm avoidance, crosswind landings, etc.) exist. This option requires flight
      examiner discretion and judicious application. When used, the examinee must be
      informed when the additional training begins and ends.
   1.12.4. The simulator/ATD may be used to accomplish additional training and re-checks.
   Areas for additional training and rechecks should be limited to those areas/sub areas that can
   be realistically accomplished in a simulator.
   1.12.5. Rechecks will normally be administered by a flight examiner other than the one who
   administered the original evaluation.
1.13. Unsatisfactory Performance. See AFI 11-202V2, Chapter 5 and the following.
   1.13.1. Conduct a thorough post-mission debriefing to the examinee and applicable aircrew
   members on all aspects of the evaluation.
   1.13.2. Immediately correct breaches of flying safety or flight discipline during an
   evaluation (this applies to all crewmembers). If the situation occurs, the flight examiner will
   also debrief an appropriate unit supervisor and if appropriate, document the deviation on an
   AF IMT 8.
   1.13.3. Notify the examinee’s squadron commander/operations officer and flight
   commander, if available, whenever less than Qualification Level “Q-1” performance is
   observed.
   1.13.4. When an examinee jeopardizes safety of flight, the flight examiner may assume the
   duties of that aircrew member, if warranted. This does not mean the flight examiner must
   assume the examinee’s position any time unsatisfactory performance is observed.
 10                                    AFI11-2C-130V2_934AWSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


1.14. Use of AF IMT 3862, Flight Evaluation Worksheet. Units may overprint AF IMT
3862, (see Attachment 2, Attachment 3, Attachment 4, Attachment 5 and Attachment 6) and
use it as an evaluation worksheet. Copy each title, area number and text (in the order illustrated),
and shading to the appropriate blocks. Units may add special interest items and/or local
evaluation requirements. All items on the AF IMT 3862 are expected to be evaluated unless they
are not part of the unit’s baseline or otherwise noted. Use the worksheet to ensure all required
areas are evaluated. Record positive and negative trend information and/or aircrew member’s
performance using the “T” column if desired (this information is necessary when transcribing the
flight information into the Patriot Excalibur (PEX) Stan/Eval module or other MAJCOM
approved module). The AF IMT 3862 or draft copy of the AF IMT 8, signed by the flight
examiner, will serve as the temporary evaluation certificate. File the certificate in the aircrew
member’s Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) immediately after the flight evaluation as a temporary
record of the evaluation results. Maintain until the finished AF IMT 8 is added to the FEF, then
dispose of properly.
1.15. Aircrew Testing. See specific testing requirements in AFI 11-202V2 Chapter 6 and the
following.
   1.15.1. Open-Book Exam. An open-book examination is a requisite for the QUAL and MSN
   evaluations. The open book QUAL exam will consist of a minimum of 60 questions. The
   open book MSN exam will consist of a minimum of 40 questions, at least 25% of which will
   come from tactical doctrine documents related to C-130 combat operations (Air Force
   Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (AFTTP)). If a combined examination is created for
   combination evaluations (QUAL/MSN), it will have the appropriate number of questions for
   each portion (i.e. the QUAL/MSN open book will have at least 100 questions).
   1.15.2. Tactics Open-Book (TACTICS) Exam. The open book tactics exam will consist of a
   minimum of 25 questions out of the AFTTP 3-1 series of publications (e.g. 3-1.1, 3-1.2, 3-
   1.25). This test will be administered by the Group/Wing tactics office (OGV may administer
   the test if appropriately equipped).
   1.15.3. Closed-Book Exam. A closed-book exam is a requisite for all QUAL or combined
   QUAL/MSN evaluations. The exam will consist of a minimum of 20 questions from the
   Master Question File (MQF). The closed book exam will contain mission/tactical questions
   for crew members that are MSN qualified. Complete a Boldface exam in conjunction with
   the closed-book exam.
   1.15.4. Instructor Open-Book Exam. For periodic INSTR exams, a portion of the open-book
   exam will include instructor questions. A separate (unique) INSTR open-book exam is not
   required. For initial instructor (INIT INSTR) evaluations, a different/separate open-book
   exam will be administered (in addition to the open-book exam if the INIT INSTR evaluation
   will count as a full-periodic evaluation). The INIT INSTR open-book examination will have
   a minimum of 20 questions and may be derived from AFMAN 36-2236, Guidebook for Air
   Force Instructors, AFI 11-2C-130V1, 2, and 3, and flight/instruct or related sources.
   Questions should include scenario-driven instructor questions.
       1.15.4.1. Subsequent (periodic) and re-qualification (RQ) INSTR Examinations. A
       portion of the open-book examination will include instructor questions. A separate
       (unique) INSTR open-book examination is not required.
AFI11-2C-130V2_934AWSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                      11


1.16. Typical C-130 Evaluation Profile(s). The unit (OG/CC or OG/OGV) will determine the
evaluation profiles suitable for aircrew evaluations based on units’ mission baseline
requirements. All items on the AF IMT 3862 are expected to be evaluated unless they are not
part of the unit’s baseline or otherwise noted.
1.17. Multiple C-130 Model Certification. Accomplish difference training IAW AFI 11-2C-
130V1, C-130 Aircrew Training. A periodic evaluation may be accomplished in any C-130
aircraft model in which the individual is certified. Attempt to accomplish requisite testing in the
same aircraft model in which the flight evaluation is flown, or expected to be flown.

                                           Chapter 2

                                   PILOT EVALUATIONS

2.1. General. This chapter standardizes initial, periodic, and re-qualification evaluations,
including requirements for instrument/qualification, mission, and instructor evaluations.
   2.1.1. Combined evaluations (i.e. INSTM/QUAL/MSN) are the desired method of
   evaluation. The combined evaluation allows greater flexibility, allows the evaluator to see
   the full spectrum of the pilot’s capabilities, and it reduces the number of overall evaluations
   each unit must accomplish. Events that are accomplished during one portion of the
   evaluation are not required to be evaluated again (e.g. if a non-precision approach is flown
   during the SKE recovery, it does not have to be re-accomplished during the instrument phase
   of the check ride).
   2.1.2. Flight examiners will not intentionally fail any equipment during flight evaluations,
   but may deny the use of systems not affecting safety of flight.
   2.1.3. Under no circumstances will a flight examiner allow the aircraft to slow below one
   engine-out Vmca or exceed aircraft limitations specified in the flight manual, regardless of
   tolerances listed for specific areas.
   2.1.4. If the flight manual recommends a specific airspeed range for performance of a
   maneuver, the flight examiner will apply the grading criteria to the upper and lower limits of
   that range.
   2.1.5. Evaluator pilots may conduct evaluations when scheduled as primary aircrew
   members.
   2.1.5. (934AW) Evaluator pilots will not be scheduled as primary crewmembers without
   934 OG/OGV Chief/Assistant Chief approval.
   2.1.6. The baseline qualification for C-130 Mobility Pilot Development (MPD)/Flight Pilots
   (FPQ and FPH) is INSTM/QUAL/MSN as described below.
       2.1.6.1. Flight Pilots (FPH) under the revised MPD syllabus are qualified to perform
       INSTM/QUAL pilot duties in the left and right seat and MSN pilot duties in the right seat
       only.
       2.1.6.2. Flight Pilots (FPQ) trained under the legacy MPD syllabus are restricted to those
       maneuvers included in the revised syllabus (FPH) as in 2.1.6.1. above.
       2.1.6.3. Flight Pilots (FPC) trained under the traditional syllabus (non-MPD) are
       restricted to right seat duties for INSTM/QUAL/MSN phases of flight. Designation as
       FP for FPC coded pilots is not authorization to perform emergency maneuvers. See AFI
       11-2C-130V3 for further guidance.
       2.1.6.4. (Added-934AW) To the maximum extent possible, an Instructor Pilot will be
       scheduled on every instrument/qualification evaluation for completion of the required
       simulated emergencies. EXCEPTION: Touch-and-go certified aircraft commanders may
       occupy the left seat during FPC instrument qualification evaluations. This restriction does
       not apply to no-notice evaluations.
AFI11-2C-130V2_934AWSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                        13


2.2. Instrument/Qualification Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Requalification). C-130
instrument evaluations will be accomplished concurrently with qualification evaluations. Include
all areas (unless otherwise noted) under GENERAL, INSTRUMENT, and QUALIFICATION.
Conduct the evaluation in-flight or in a WST (Level C certification or better).
   2.2.1. Accomplish a minimum of one precision and one non-precision approach.
   Instrument/ Qualification evaluations should include approaches to airfields other than home
   station or deployed locations.
   2.2.2. Flight Pilot. (FPC)
       2.2.2.1. From the right seat, evaluate appropriate areas in this chapter and as illustrated
       on the evaluation worksheet at Attachment 2/3. Designate crew position as FP with
       restrictions on the AF Form 8.
       2.2.2.2. The AF Form 8 will note the restriction “Not qualified to perform left seat flying
       duties unsupervised” on all evaluations not leading towards Aircraft Commander
       upgrade.
   2.2.3. Flight Pilot. (FPQ/FPH)
       2.2.3.1. From the left seat, evaluate appropriate areas in this chapter as illustrated on the
       evaluation worksheet at Attachment 2/3. Designate crew position as FP on the AF
       Form 8.
       2.2.3.2. Flight Pilots do not require a separate INIT INSTM/QUAL evaluation when
       transitioning to Aircraft Commander. The skill set is identical for both positions. If an
       INSTM/QUAL evaluation is administered in conjunction with the INIT MSN evaluation
       leading to Aircraft Commander Certification document the INSTM/QUAL and INIT
       MSN on separate blocks in the flight phase section of the AF Form 8 and designate crew
       position as MP on the AF Form 8.
   2.2.4. Aircraft Commander.
       2.2.4.1. From the left seat, evaluate appropriate areas in this chapter as illustrated on the
       evaluation worksheet at Attachment 2/3. Designate crew position as MP on the AF
       Form 8.
   2.2.5. Instructor Pilot.
       2.2.5.1. From the left or right seat evaluate appropriate areas in this chapter as illustrated
       on the evaluation worksheet at Attachment 2/3. Designate crew position as IP on the AF
       Form 8. See 2.5 for further guidance.
2.3. Mission Evaluations (Initial, Periodic, and Requalification). Include all areas under
GENERAL and applicable areas under MISSION listed on the evaluation worksheet at
Attachment 2/3. Units and/or aircrew with a mission evaluation requirement (regardless of the
type of mission being flown) will be evaluated on Area 47 (Defensive Systems/Tactics) and Area
48 (Threat Avoidance).
   2.3.1. For units with Station Keeping Equipment (SKE) or the Adverse Weather Aerial
   Delivery System (AWADS) airdrop mission, a visual low-level route or SKE/AWADS route
   to an airdrop and recovery must be flown to complete the evaluation. Alternate the type of
   route/airdrop/recovery flown on subsequent periodic MSN evaluations at a minimum. Unit
14                                    AFI11-2C-130V2_934AWSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


  policy may be more restrictive requiring both types be flown. Regardless, failure to
  accomplish the proper events will result in loss of MSN qualification for affected individuals.
  2.3.1. (934AW) Evaluators will check the profile last flown by the examinee, by
  referencing the IMT 3862 and the Pilot Evaluation Board located in the Stan/Eval Office.
  Visual route profiles should be flown at night to facilitate the evaluation of NVG devices.
     2.3.1.1. DELETED
     2.3.1.2. DELETED
     2.3.1.3. DELETED
     2.3.1.4. DELETED
     2.3.1.5. DELETED
  2.3.2. SKE/AWADS evaluations must be planned and briefed as a 2-ship (minimum) but
  may be flown single-ship (at the discretion of the evaluator).
  2.3.3. A visual tactical arrival will be flown and will consist of a high or low altitude tactical
  arrival. The low altitude tactical arrival may be made at the end of the penetration approach.
  2.3.4. The max-effort portion will consist of a tactical/max-effort takeoff and tactical/max-
  effort landing and should be accomplished at the end of the tactical approach. Landings will
  be performed on an actual landing zone if available. If not available, a larger runway with
  landing zone markings (IAW AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations) and
  clearly identifiable touchdown zone may be used. One go-around is permitted, provided the
  aircraft does not touch down short of the zone. As a minimum, thoroughly debrief Flight
  Pilots on pilot-not-flying duties during tactical/max-effort procedures.
     2.3.4.1. Airland Mission Pilots that maintain tactical/max-effort qualification will fly an
     IFR or VFR high altitude route (minimum of 20 minutes long and greater than 5000’
     AGL) to a TOA at an airfield. The arrival will consist of either a high altitude tactical
     arrival followed by a tactical/max-effort landing or penetration decent to a low altitude
     tactical arrival followed by a tactical/max-effort landing.
  2.3.5. Pilots that do not meet unit baseline mission requirement (such as, Basic Mission
  Capable (BMC) crewmembers) will note appropriate restrictions the AF Form 8 (i.e.
  Airdrop, formation, SKE/AWADS, etc.). See Chapter 1 for further baseline guidance.
  2.3.6. Flight Pilot. (FPC/FPQ/FPH)
     2.3.6.1. From the right seat evaluate all applicable Mission areas in this chapter as
     illustrated on the evaluation worksheet at Attachment 2/3. The mission evaluation will
     focus on pilot monitoring duties. Pilot flying duties may be evaluated on Areas 38/39
     and Areas 47/48. Designate as FP with restrictions as needed on the AF Form 8. The
     evaluation may be flown in the lead (preferred) or wing position.
     2.3.6.2. Annotate Flight Pilots’ (FPQ) AF Form 8 with the following restriction: “Not
     authorized to perform max-effort PF duties”.
     2.3.6.3. All pilots not previously certified as an aircraft commander in a C-130 will
     receive an initial mission evaluation (INIT MSN) prior to aircraft commander
     certification. Conduct the INIT MSN evaluation IAW para 2.3.7. and designate crew
AFI11-2C-130V2_934AWSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012                                                        15


       position as MP on the AF Form 8. NOTE: The Operational Mission Evaluation no
       longer exists. An Operational Mission Checkout will now be administered as part of the
       Pilot Checkout Program. See AFI 11-2C-130 Volume 1 for further guidance.
   2.3.7. Aircraft Commander.
       2.3.7.1. From the left seat, evaluate appropriate areas in this chapter as illustrated on the
       evaluation worksheet at Attachment 2/3. Designate crew position as MP on the AF
       Form 8.
       2.3.7.2. Non-Lead. The route should be flown in the wing position.
       2.3.7.3. Element Lead. Accomplish the route in the element lead (preferred) or flight
       lead position.
       2.3.7.4. Flight Lead. Accomplish the route in the flight lead (preferred) or element lead
       position. The flight lead pilot should also participate in the mission commander duties.
   2.3.8. Instructor Pilot. From the left or right seat evaluate appropriate areas in this chapter as
   illustrated on the evaluation worksheet at Attachment 2/3. Designate crew position as IP on
   the AF Form 8. See 2.5 for further guidance.
2.4. LC-130 Evaluations. Conduct the evaluation during actual missions or under simulated
mission conditions. A ski mission profile includes a ski airborne radar approach (ARA), ski
landing and ski take- off. For single-ship VFR airdrop qualified pilots, evaluation of the airdrop
mission will be at the discretion of the 109AW OG/CC.
2.5. Instructor Evaluations (Initial, Periodic, and Requalification). Flight examiners will
place particular emphasis on the examinee’s ability to recognize student difficulties and provide
timely, effective corrective action. Instructor pilots should be able to brief, observe, assess, and

                                          Chapter 3

                               NAVIGATOR EVALUATIONS

3.1. General. This chapter standardizes initial, periodic, and re-qualification evaluations,
including requirements for qualification, mission, and instructor evaluations.
   3.1.1. Flight examiners will not intentionally fail any equipment during flight evaluations,
   but may deny the use of systems not affecting safety of flight.
3.2. Qualification Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Re-qualification). On a Category I or II
route of no less than 1.5 hours, the examinee must demonstrate proficiency in navigation
procedures. All General and Qualification areas/sub areas are required qualification evaluation
items unless otherwise specified in Attachment 3. In addition, navigators will take the open-
book written instrument examination IAW AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Course
Program. This will be documented on the ground phase portion of the AF IMT 8.
   3.2.1. Simulator Evaluations. Navigators may accomplish initial or periodic qualification
   evaluations or the qualification portion of a combined QUAL/MSN evaluation in an
   Operational Flight Trainer (OFT), Weapon System Trainer (WST), or Satellite Navigation
   Station (SNS).
   3.2.1. (934AW) An individual’s first QUAL check after the INIT QUAL will be conducted
   in the aircraft.
       3.2.1.1. Basic Qualified Navigators must accomplish, at a minimum, every other Qual
       evaluation in the aircraft.
   3.2.2. Airborne Radar Approach (ARA). The ARA is considered part of a navigator’s basic
   qualification. It will, however, be evaluated on both the qualification and mission evaluation
   (only one required if doing a combination evaluation). State that an ARA was evaluated in
   the comments section of the AF IMT 8. A navigator graded U in the ARA area may not fly
   unsupervised on any flight until successful re-accomplishment. The ARA may not be
   verbally debriefed.
   3.2.3. Grid Navigation. After initial Grid certification, evaluate Grid procedures on all
   periodic qualification evaluations. State, “Grid procedures were evaluated,” in the comments
   section of the AF IMT 8. At the discretion of the flight examiner, a navigator graded U in
   the Grid area may continue to fly unsupervised on non-Grid missions.
3.3. Mission Evaluations (Initial, Periodic, and Re-qualification). Units/aircrew with an
airdrop requirement will conduct mission evaluations on an airdrop sortie. Units/aircrew without
an airdrop requirement will conduct mission evaluations on a sortie reflecting the
unit’s/individual’s primary mission. All General and Mission areas/sub areas are required
evaluation items unless otherwise specified in Attachment 3.
   3.3.1. The airdrop profile will (as a minimum) consist of a visual low-level route or a
   SKE/AWADS route, flown to an airdrop and a TOT. A TOT must be accomplished during
   flight and will not be verbally debriefed. Type of route flown will be alternated on recurring
   mission evaluations, i.e. if a visual route is flown this time then an AWADS/SKE route must
   be flown next time. The navigator will be unqualified in the C-130 mission if he/she goes for
 36                                   AFI11-2C-130V2_934AWSUP_I 28 NOVEMBER 2012


   greater than two evaluation cycles without accomplishing both of these events. The evaluator
   and examinee will ensure the correct profile to be evaluated prior to flight. Units may require
   both types to be flown.
   3.3.1. (934AW) In addition to AFI 11-2C-130V2 requirements, navigator mission
   evaluation profiles should consist of SKE and visual formation procedures, enroute threat
   avoidance (normally during the visual route) and a formation recovery. Evaluators will check
   the profile last flown by the examinee by referencing the individual’s evaluation IMT 3862
   or their FEF located in the Stan/Eval Office. Visual route profiles should be flown at night to
   facilitate the evaluation of NVG devices.
       3.3.1.1. Non-Lead Navigator. Visual route: Accomplish an unfamiliar visual tactical
       low-level route in the lead position or single ship. Formal school student evaluations
       may consider any low-level route unfamiliar. SKE route: Normally accomplish in the
       wing position.
       3.3.1.2. Lead Navigator. The lead navigator should participate in the mission commander
       duties. Visual route: Accomplish an unfamiliar visual tactical low-level route in the lead
       position or single ship. SKE/AWADS route: Accomplish the SKE/AWADS route in
       SKE/AWADS lead or SKE/AWADS element lead position. The SKE/AWADS portion
       must be planned and briefed as a 2-ship (minimum) but may be flown single ship (at the
       discretion of the evaluator).
NOTES:
An unfamiliar route is defined as a route not flown by the examinee in the previous six months.
Run-in should be at least 15 degrees different from normal run-in heading.
Visual routes should be NVG routes.
   3.3.2. Combined QUAL/MSN Evaluation. The QUAL/MSN evaluation is not mandatory
   for mission qualified navigators, but may be used to reduce the number of evaluations given
   during a 17-month cycle, while focusing on the most essential areas of the navigation
   process. The QUAL/MSN evaluation will consist of an airland planning portion (to include
   applicable open/closed book tests/IRC/EPE/Boldface requisites) and the traditional low-level
   mission planning followed by the mission evaluation. An ARA will be flown. The airland
   planning will be completed prior to the mission flight evaluation. The evaluator will present
   an overwater planning scenario based on a realistic operational mission scenario that will
   drive the airland mission planning. Evaluators will examine airland mission planning to
   include all applicable navigation procedures (route selection, flight in formation, publication
   review, flight plan, chart preparation, weather consideration, preflight fuel planning, equal
   time point computation, coast in/out procedures, deviation checks, aircraft position fixes, log
   work, dead reckoning, fuel management, departure and arrival).
       3.3.2.1. The low-level mission planning will be completed prior to the mission
       evaluation. The flying phase of the mission will remain as currently defined.
       3.3.2.2. During the airland/mission planning phases and flight debrief, the evaluator may
       ask the examinee to demonstrate navigation procedures pertaining to airland and/or
       mission planning.

3.4. LC-130 Evaluations. Conduct the evaluation during actual missions or under simulated
mission conditions. A ski mission profile includes a ski ARA, ski landing and ski takeoff. For
single-ship VFR air- drop qualified navigators, evaluation of the airdrop mission will be at the
discretion of the 109AW OG/ CC.
3.5. Instructor Evaluations (Initial, Periodic, and Re-qualification). Flight examiners will
place particular emphasis on the examinee’s ability to recognize student difficulties and provide
timely, effective corrective action. State that instructional abilities were evaluated in the
comments section of the AF IMT 8. List a minimum of two areas instructed by the examinee.
   3.5.1. If airdrop mission qualified, all initial and re-qualification instructor evaluations
   require the examinee to instruct a SKE (SKE/AWADS if applicable) or visual low-level
   route and airdrop.
   3.5.2. All instructor areas/sub areas are required instructor evaluation items on all flight
   evaluations.
3.6. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE).
   3.6.1. The EPE on qualification evaluations should cover the following areas: Emergency
   signals, SCNS/INS; ground emergencies; in-flight emergencies (fuselage fire/smoke and
   fumes elimination, in-flight door warning, rapid decompression, bailout procedures); landing
   emergencies (landing gear retracted, ditching).
   3.6.2. On mission evaluations the EPE should cover airdrop emergency procedures,
   defensive system operation, threat interpretation and evasive action.

held. Example: An engineer with NVG qualifications should fly a profile using NVG
procedures. Minimum requirement for a mission eval will normally include a low-level, airdrop,
and max effort take-off and landing. Verbally debrief mission items not accomplished in-flight.
If the mission evaluation is conducted independently of the qualification evaluation, another EPE
must be conducted and annotated in the ground phase section of the mission AF IMT 8. EPE for
the mission evaluation should be directed towards emergency procedures encountered/associated
with a tactical mission; however, airdrop emergency procedures, defensive systems operation,
lookout doctrine/threat calls, and threat pre-emptive/reactive counter-tactics will be verbally
evaluated. All General and Mission areas/sub areas are required mission evaluation items unless
otherwise specified in Attachment 4.
4.3. (934AW)Mission Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Re-qualification). A typical MSN
evaluation profile will consist of, a maximum effort TOLD card, airdrop card, Combat
Entry/Exit Checklist and all applicable portions of the Airdrop/Airland Checklists. An airdrop
profile will be accomplished to include an actual airdrop load if possible. NVG procedures
should also be evaluated if individual’s availability and the scheduling permit.

                              LOADMASTER EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. This chapter standardizes initial, periodic, and re-qualification evaluations,
including requirements for qualification, mission, and instructor evaluations.
   5.1.1. Flight examiners will not intentionally fail any equipment during flight evaluations,
   but may deny the use of systems not affecting safety of flight.
   5.1.2. (Added-934AW) Only one loadmaster may receive a recurring qualification/mission
   evaluation on the aircraft, regardless of the number of platforms/containers or number of
   airdrops accomplished unless approved by the 934 OG/OGV Chief/Assistant Chief. This
   does not prevent the flight examiner from administering a no-notice or SPOT evaluation to
   the other loadmaster.
5.2. Qualification Evaluations (Initial, Periodic, and Re-qualification). For qualification
evaluations, the aircraft must be pre-flighted and loaded with a palletized or vehicular load, a
mission flown, and then offloaded to complete the evaluation. If a qualification evaluation is
combined with a mission evaluation, an airdrop platform/CDS can be used for the qualification
evaluation load/offload requirement. If a load is not available for an evaluation, palletized,
airdrop platform, or vehicular cargo will be static loaded and offloaded upon completion of the
flight portion. All General and Qualification areas/sub areas are required qualification evaluation
items unless otherwise specified in Attachment 5.
5.3. Mission Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Re-qualification). Initial and re-qualification
(unqualified past two years) mission evaluations will consist of a mass CDS (minimum four
containers), or a sequential heavy equipment load. If a mass CDS or sequential heavy equipment
load cannot be dropped for the evaluation, a single heavy equipment platform may be airdropped
provided sequential heavy equipment and mass CDS airdrop rigging was completed during
training. As a minimum for periodic mission evaluations the airdrop must consist of a single
CDS container or single heavy equipment platform. Do not conduct two separate mission
evaluations on the same flight with only one airdrop load aboard. An airdrop sortie and
evaluation may be credited if an unplanned no-drop is called after completion of the Slowdown
Checklist provided the no-drop was not due to loadmaster error. All General and Mission
areas/sub areas are required mission evaluation items unless otherwise specified in Attachment
5. Document initial personnel restriction when actual personnel is not completed during initial
mission training on IMT Form 8. Use the following statement when actual personnel cannot be
performed during initial mission training:
  RESTRICTIONS:
   SUPERVISED STATUS for personnel airdrop until an actual static line personnel airdrop is
accomplished. Final certification will be accomplished under the supervision of a loadmaster
instructor or flight examiner.
   Actual personnel airdrop accomplished on __________.
5.3.1. (Added-934AW) For recurring QUAL/MSN (combined) evaluations, the examinee should
demonstrate loading a single heavy equipment platform to meet QUAL requirements. Unlike

5.3.2.5. (Added-934AW) An Airplane Preparation for Equipment or CDS Airdrop Checklist.
5.4. LC-130 Evaluations. 109AW mission evaluations will be at the discretion of the OG/CC.
Mission evaluation items may be verbally debriefed with 109AW OG/CC approval.
5.5. Instructor Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Re-qualification). Flight examiners will
place particular emphasis on the examinee’s ability to recognize student difficulties and provide
timely, effective corrective action. All instructor areas/sub areas are required instructor
evaluation items. State that instructional abilities were evaluated in the comments section of the
AF Form 8. List a minimum of two areas instructed by the examinee.
5.6. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE).
   5.6.1. The EPE should cover the following areas during a qualification evaluation:
   Emergency signals, ground emergencies, in-flight emergencies (fuselage fire/smoke and
   fume elimination, in-flight door warning, rapid decompression, cargo door and ramp failure,
   cargo jettison, bailout procedures); landing emergencies (landing gear retracted, ditching).
   5.6.2. The EPE should cover the following areas during a mission evaluation: Personnel;
   heavy equipment; CDS/CRRC, and any other mission specific airdrop emergencies.
