This instruction establishes control and accountability requirements for the proper collection and disposal
of regulated garbage collected from aircraft returning to Fairchild AFB from an originating location out-
side the United States. The purpose of this instruction is to provide direction for the handling and disposal
of all garbage from foreign originating aircraft. This instruction is applicable to all military, civilian, and
contract personnel in the 92d Air Refueling Wing (ARW) and the 141 ARW of the Washington Air
National Guard (ANG). Ensure all records created by this supplement are maintained and disposed of
IAW AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

This instruction has been revised to specify locations for storage of regulated garbage; a record has been
developed to track all regulated garbage being stored, and 92d Civil Engineering Squadron added respon-
sibilities.


1. Definition.
   1.1. Regulated garbage is defined as all waste material derived in whole or part from fruits, vegeta-
   bles, meats, or other plant or animal (including poultry) material and other refuse of any character
   whatsoever that has been associated with any such material aboard any means of conveyance. This
   includes food scraps, table refuse, galley refuse food wrappers, packaging materials, and other waste
   material from stores, food preparation areas, passenger or crew quarters, dining rooms and any other
   areas on vessels, aircraft, or other means of conveyance.

2. General.
    2.1. All regulated garbage will be collected, double bagged and placed in leak proof, covered recep-
    tacles clearly marked as containing regulated garbage. All regulated garbage will be taken to,
    92d Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS)/Raptor Tool Room, 600 S. Hansel Avenue or 141st Air-
    craft Generation Squadron (AGS), 1200 Taxiway J Rd. A log with the date, time, estimated weight,
    total bags, and flight number will be maintained in the storage areas located at both collection sites,
    IAW AFMAN 37-139.
    2.2. When immediate disposal is not feasible, regulated garbage will be stored in a temporary secure
    area that is not normally accessible by people or animals and is separate from normal garbage storage.
    The 92 AMXS/Raptor Tool Room located at 600 S. Hansel Avenue and the 141 AGS/Storage Room,
    1200 Taxiway J Rd. have been designated as the temporary storage areas for the 92 ARW and the 141
    ARW respectively.
    2.3. Regulated garbage must be properly disposed of within 72 hours or a period of time designated
    by the United States Department of Agriculture.

3. Responsibilities.
    3.1. 92d Civil Engineer Squadron (CES) will ensure a contract is in place to perform disposal opera-
    tions at the Spokane Waste to Energy Plant.
    3.2. The 92 AMXS, Transient Alert Contractor and the 141 ARW will:
       3.2.1. Properly remove, bag, and secure all garbage from all aircraft (transient or home station)
       whose flight originated outside the United States.
       3.2.2. Place properly bagged garbage in the container at 600 S. Hansell Avenue or 1200 Taxiway
       J Rd. pending transportation to the Spokane Waste to Energy Plant.
       3.2.3. Keep a record with date, time, estimated weight, total bags, and flight number. This log will
       remain in the 92 AMXS or 141 AGS temporary storage areas. The log shall be maintained on site
       until the end of the calendar year, at which time the log will be transferred to 92 CES Environmen-
       tal Flight and archived in accordance with AFMAN 37-139.
       3.2.4. Units producing regulated garbage are responsible to transport garbage in a closed vehicle
       to the Spokane Waste to Energy Plant (2900 Geiger Blvd) and will place the garbage directly in
       the pit that feeds the incinerator. Disposal must take place within 72 hours of generation of the
       waste. (Exception: this step not required by Transient Alert Contractor).
