CHECK AT LAUNCH FACILITY



NO.    ITEM                                                       YES     NO   N/A
1.     Upon entry to the LF service area, note any
       accumulation of snow that could interfere with the
       movement of personnel/vehicles on paved or gravel
       areas and around the LF gate. Using the 5-foot snow
       depth pole, check the snow depth at Position 1 and
       report to the FSC
2.     When approaching the launcher door from the LF
       gate, stop a short distance from the apron that contains
       the personnel access hatch (PAH) and launcher door.
       Check/report snow depth at Positions 2, 3, 4, and 5.
3.     Proceed beyond the launcher door and onto the
       launcher track. Check and report the snow depth at
       5-foot intervals along the closure door at Positions 7
       through 9.
4.     Check the snow depth along the closure door rails at
       Position 6. If water has accumulated, report the
       approximate depth to the FSC.
5.     Pay particular attention to drainage ditches. See if
       ground drains are blocked at any point, and if there is
       any water draining. Report all findings to 90 SW
       Missile Maintenance Operations Center.
