      SUBJECT: Senior Leader Secure Communications Modernization (SLSCM)

      RELEASABILITY: There are no releasability restrictions on this publication.

             By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this AF Guidance Memorandum replaces
      AFGM 33-01, Senior Leader Secure Communications Modernization (SLSCM), dated 30 Jul
      2012. Compliance with this Memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its directions are
      inconsistent with other Air Force publications, the information herein prevails, in accordance
      with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.

              At the direction of the Department of Defense, Chief Information Officer, the Secretaries
      of the Military Departments will ensure senior leadership infrastructure, communication
      platforms, and equipment are interoperable with the SLSCM strategy and, as appropriate,
      support the integration of current and IP-based command and control (C2) systems. The
      Department of Defense, Chief Information Officer also directs the removal and replacement of
      current voice, video, and data capabilities with IP-based broadband capabilities that meet senior
      leadership operational requirements, within fixed and rotary aircraft, and ground mobile vehicles.
      For Air Force, that means ensuring fixed wing aircraft are equipped with wideband Satellite
      Communications (SATCOM) and addressing equipment issues to enable IP-based voice, data,
      and Video Teleconferencing (VTC) that will meet senior leader operational requirements.
      Removal of legacy equipment will be considered after leadership requirements are met.

             Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
      maintained in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the
      Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS).

              The guidance in this Memorandum becomes void after one year has elapsed from the date
      of this Memorandum.
