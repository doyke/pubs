1. DEFINITIONS:
    1.1. Fixed PA System. A system permanently installed in a base facility. The Club Five Six
    and Falcon Dunes Clubhouse have existing fixed PA systems capable of supporting most
    events.
    1.2. Mobile PA System. A system set up on a temporary, non-repetitive basis for an official
    function of short duration. This system can provide highly configurable support for indoor
    and outdoor events for up to 1,000 people.
    1.3. Portable PA System. A system set up on a temporary, non-repetitive basis for any
    function of short duration. This system is signed-out by the requesting office and supports
    outdoor events of up to 300 people and indoor events for up to 600 people.
    1.4. Unofficial Function. A function designed with the primary intent to entertain. Events
    such as luncheons, unit parties, picnics, and sporting events are considered unofficial and are
    supported by a signed-out, portable PA system if assets are available. Official functions have
    priority and unofficial function requests will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
2. RESPONSIBILITIES:
    2.1. The 56 CS Airfield Systems work center (56 CS/SCOAA) will:
       2.1.1. Provide mobile PA equipment to support OFFICIAL functions only.
       2.1.2. Determine supportability of PA requests based on current mission, manning
       requirements, and equipment availability. The primary mission of 56 CS/SCOAA is to
       provide communications-electronics maintenance to air traffic control and landing
       systems, as well as tactical air navigation and instrument landing systems. These systems
       carry a high priority and have a critical impact on flight safety. All outages affecting, or
       potentially affecting, the mission will have priority over PA support.
       2.1.3. Contact the requestor within 48 hours of receipt of official PA request.
       2.1.4. Have all requested equipment set up and fully operational at least 1 hour before
       scheduled event start time unless otherwise coordinated with event point of contact.
    2.2. 56 CS/CC is the final authority to determine the level of support given when there is a
    conflict between two different PA setups at the same time.
    2.3. 56 CS/SCOAA, 56 CS/SCO, or 56 CS/CC may cancel PA setups or remove PA
    equipment from operation if personnel or equipment safety is threatened (i.e., during
    inclement weather).
    2.4. Facility managers are solely responsible for providing fixed PA equipment in facilities
    used by base personnel. Use of these systems will be coordinated through the facility
    managers. These facilities include, but are not limited to, Club Five Six and Falcon Dunes
    Clubhouse.
    2.5. 56 CS/SCOAA can provide training to personnel responsible for fixed PA systems such
    as the Base Theater.
    2.6. Organizations requesting PA support will:
LUKEAFBI33-101 11 October 2011                                                               3


     2.6.1. Submit an official request through the Public Address SharePoint site at:
     https://luke.eis.aetc.af.mil/56MSG/CS/Public%20Address%20Request/Forms/AllIte
     ms.aspx. Once at the site, select the “Public Address Request Form Jun2011.” The
     form must be filled out and submitted no later than 10 duty days before the event (to
     include any applicable practice event). In the event SharePoint cannot be accessed,
     submit the request utilizing Luke AFB Form 320 to the 56 CS/SCOAA organizational
     mailbox. 56 CS/SCOAA personnel will contact the customer within 2 business days of
     receipt. If contact is not made, the customer may call 6-6826 to inquire about the status.
     2.6.2. Provide 56 CS/SCOAA all interface devices (i.e., laptop computer, MP3 player) at
     least 2 duty days before the event for testing purposes. 56 CS/SCOAA public address
     equipment can interface with devices/instruments having XLR, RCA, or ¼” jacks. Please
     be advised that 56 CS/SCOAA does not provide interface devices such as laptop
     computers, projectors, MP3 players or cables that support these devices.
     2.6.3. Provide 56 CS/SCOAA support personnel access to event location at least 2 hours
     before the event start time.
     2.6.4. Provide personnel to operate audio equipment during non-ceremonial audio
     selections or perform “disc jockey” type services. Provide these personnel at least 1 hour
     before the event start time for training.
     2.6.5. Provide 56 CS/SCOAA support personnel a written sequence of events (script), to
     include highlighted music cues, at least 24 hours before the event start time.
     2.6.6. Immediately notify 56 CS/SCOAA of any changes or cancellations.
3. PROCEDURES:
  3.1. Obtaining fixed PA equipment. Fixed PA systems installation should be obtained
  through the Base Contracting Office. Permanently installed PA systems are justified and
  procured by submitting a Luke AFB Form 3215, Communications Systems Requirements
  Document to the            56 CS/SCX Plans and Resources Flight. 56 CS/SCOAA may be
  used as a technical consultant for any PA system acquisition.
  3.2. Obtaining portable PA system support:
     3.2.1. Requesting units must submit a 56 CS Public Address Support Request through
     the SharePoint site as outlined in paragraph 2.6.1 Equipment is scheduled on a first-
     come, first-served basis.
     3.2.2. PA equipment can be picked up at building 1040, extension 6-6826, the day before
     the event and must be returned not later than 0800 the morning after the event. If the
     equipment is to be used over a weekend or holiday, the requestor must pick up the
     equipment the last duty day before the event and return it the first duty day (morning)
     following the event. All equipment must be picked up before 1500 and returned not later
     than 0800 the next duty day. No-show letters will be sent to unit commanders (CCs) for
     equipment not returned on time.
     3.2.3. All PA equipment is signed for on an AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
     Equipment must be returned in the condition it was issued. Coil and tape or tie cables to
     prevent tangling. Identify broken parts, problems, or discrepancies when the equipment
4                                                          LUKEAFBI33-101 11 October 2011


       is returned. The customer is responsible for any lost or damaged equipment. Training
       will be given at the time of pickup to ensure the customer can operate the equipment.
    3.3. Obtaining mobile PA system support:
       3.3.1. Mobile PA system support may be requested for any official function as outlined
       in paragraph 1.2 Requesting units must submit a Public Address Support Request as
       outlined in paragraph 2.6.1 If personnel and/or equipment are unavailable, a portable PA
       system, if available, will be offered to support the requestor’s function.
       3.3.2. Practices/rehearsals will be supported on a case-by-case basis. As referenced in
       2.1.2., the primary mission of 56 CS/SCOAA is to provide communications-electronics
       maintenance to air traffic control and landing systems. Supported practices will be kept
       to a minimum and be entrusted to the unit if at all possible. Practices can also be
       supported by a portable PA system, if available. If the requesting unit is having a
       practice before the day of the event, 56 CS/SCOAA will be given an opportunity to
       assemble the PA system before the practice and may leave the equipment in place until
       the official event concludes. 56 CS/SCOAA will provide the requesting unit with an AF
       Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, and training on how to control the system's on/off
       and volume functions. If this is not possible, a portable PA system will be offered, if
       available, for the practice event.
    3.4. Call 6-6826 for help in scheduling/requesting PA support. Short-notice support, within
    10 duty days before the day of the event, must be requested in writing with the requestor’s
    unit CC and the 56 CS/SCO endorsements. The letter must state why the 10-duty day
    advanced notice was not given. Base e-mail is an allowable substitute for the traditional
    letter. The 10-duty day window is to provide adequate time for scheduling, and also to
    provide the requesting unit time to locate an alternate source in the event a request is denied
    or cannot be satisfied.
    3.5. Approval or disapproval of support will be determined at the time the request is
    received. If approved, the POC will be contacted for confirmation and for any additional
    information that may be required. If disapproved, the POC will be contacted with possible
    alternative solutions.
    3.6. 56 CS/SCOAA personnel will normally stay with the equipment to ensure continuous
    operation unless precluded by higher priority mission requirements or lack of manpower
    resources. In the event a 56 CS/SCOAA technician cannot stay, or is not required to stay
    with the system, the PA system user will be required to sign an AF Form 1297, Temporary
    Issue Receipt, for the equipment. The 56 CS/SCOAA technician(s) will be utilized to run
    official ceremonial music only (i.e., National Anthem, Air Force Song, Ruffles and
    Flourishes, etc.). The requesting organization wishing to use music that does not fall within
    that category (i.e., pop, jazz, rap, etc.) will need to provide an individual to start/stop the
    music at appropriate times.
    3.7. All agencies (i.e., Public Affairs, and local media) requesting interface with the
    56 CS/SCOAA PA system will have their device connected and tested no later than 1 hour
    before the start of any event. Should this interfacing equipment interfere with the 56
    CS/SCOAA PA system, the 56 CS/SCOAA technician is authorized to disconnect the
    equipment and deny the interface.
LUKEAFBI33-101 11 October 2011                                                                 5


  3.8. 56 CS/SCOAA is not responsible for the installation/maintenance of fixed systems or
  for the PA support of UNOFFICIAL functions. AFI 65-106 Appropriated Fund Support of
  Morale, Welfare, and Recreation and Non-appropriated Fund Instrumentalities, prohibits an
  appropriated funds maintenance resource from working on public address systems in non-
  appropriated funds facilities (i.e., Officers' Club, Enlisted Club, Recreation Center,
  Gymnasium, Base Theater, etc.).
