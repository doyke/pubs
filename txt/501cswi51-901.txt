1. POLICY. Acts of misconduct committed by family members threaten the security and safety of per-
sons and property on RAF Alconbury, RAF Molesworth, and RAF Upwood. Family members who have
engaged in misconduct shall appear before the Family Member Misconduct Board (FMMB) at the direc-
tion of and at the discretion of 423 ABG/CC and 423 ABG/CD. While not intended as a substitute for dis-
cipline under civilian employment regulations, the Family Member Misconduct Program (FMMP) can,
depending on the circumstances, hear cases involving civilian employees, contractors, and other
non-active duty military members who have committed misconduct on the installations. In lieu of conven-
ing the FMMP, 423 ABG/CC or 423 ABG/CD may take or recommend the 501st Combat Support Wing
Commander (501 CSW/CC) take direct action against family members who have engaged in misconduct,
as provided by this instruction. Actions of 423 ABG/CC and the FMMP will be directed toward ensuring
2                                                                       501CSWI51-901 29 JULY 2008


good order and discipline on RAF Alconbury, RAF Molesworth, and RAF Upwood, and, when possible,
rehabilitating the offender.

2. RESPONSIBILITIES.
    2.1. US and foreign military members, US and foreign government employees, contractors, and other
    sponsoring personnel associated with the 501st Combat Support Wing on RAFs Alconbury, Moles-
    worth and Upwood have primary responsibility for ensuring their family members comply with all
    laws, regulations and applicable standards of behavior. Failure to do so may result in adverse admin-
    istrative action against the offender, the sponsor, or both.
    2.2. The 501st Combat Support Wing Commander (501 CSW/CC), is ultimately responsible for
    ensuring good order and discipline on RAFs Alconbury, Molesworth and Upwood, and may regulate
    the conduct of all active duty service members, retired members, DoD civilian employees, contractor
    personnel, persons employed by NATO units and their family members thereon. 501 CSW/CC has
    delegated the authority to resolve family member misconduct cases to 423 ABG/CC and 423 ABG/
    CD.
    2.3. The Area Superintendent, Department of Defense Dependent Schools (DoDDS), and other
    school administrators have primary responsibility for addressing disciplinary problems that occur on
    school buses, on school grounds during the school day and at school sponsored activities. Individual
    school principals are primarily responsible for sanctioning students who are involved in misconduct,
    and for making determinations regarding suspension or expulsion from school. However, 423 ABG/
    CC and 423 ABG/CD may also initiate corrective action, as consistent with this instruction, in cases
    where an act of misconduct disrupts the good order of the installation or otherwise threatens the secu-
    rity and safety of persons assigned to RAFs Alconbury, Molesworth and Upwood, and/or their depen-
    dents.

3. THE FAMILY MEMBER MISCONDUCT BOARD (FMMB)
    3.1. Purpose. The purpose of the FMMB is to provide a method and framework for resolving cases of
    family member misconduct arising on RAFs Alconbury, Molesworth and Upwood, or involving a
    dependent of any person stationed at those locations.
    3.2. Policy. The recommendations of the FMMB for corrective action shall promote the protection of
    life and property at RAFs Alconbury, Molesworth and Upwood, the rehabilitation of the offender, the
    preservation of good order and discipline, and the deterrence of the offender and others from engaging
    in acts of misconduct.
    3.3. Administrative Process. The process of resolving civilian misconduct issues is administrative,
    not judicial. Alleged offenders are not entitled to have legal counsel present during the hearing. Mili-
    tary attorneys from the Office of the Staff Judge Advocate and from the Office of Area Defense Coun-
    sel are not available to assist alleged offenders in preparing for hearings. Individuals may, however,
    retain civilian counsel at their own expense to assist in their preparation.
    3.4. Composition. The Board is composed of the following persons or their designated representa-
    tives:
       3.4.1. Voting Members:
           3.4.1.1. Chairperson, 423 ABG/CD or designee.

         by 423 ABG/CD.

         3.5.1.1. The 423d Security Forces Squadron (423 SFS) or the Air Force Office of Special
         Investigations (AFOSI) normally investigates cases of serious misconduct. All reports of
         investigation disclosing misconduct committed by family members will be forwarded to the
         Office of the Staff Judge Advocate (501 CSW/JA) and 423 ABG/CD.
         3.5.1.2. Other cases of misconduct are reported to 423 SFS thorough the law enforcement
         desk and are documented in the daily blotter.
         3.5.1.3. 501 CSW/JA shall receive all reports of investigation and daily blotter entries involv-
         ing family member misconduct and may forward these to 423 ABG/CD with a recommenda-
         tion on the appropriateness of referring the case to the FMMB for disposition.
         3.5.1.4. Unit commander and interested staff agency chiefs may report incidents of miscon-
         duct to 423 ABG/CD for consideration of a board hearing.
     3.5.2. Disposition of Misconduct Cases.
         3.5.2.1. 423 ABG/CD has several options in deciding how to dispose of a misconduct case:
            3.5.2.1.1. Refer the case to the sponsor’s immediate commander for appropriate action.
            3.5.2.1.2. Impose any corrective actions, including those contained in this instruction, that
            are within his or her discretionary authority.

            3.5.2.1.5. Take any other action appropriate to the circumstances of the case.
4                                                                   501CSWI51-901 29 JULY 2008


       3.5.2.2. If 423 ABG/CD is unavailable to review a case, or if 423 ABG/CD has referred the
       case to 423 ABG/CC for disposition, 423 ABG/CC may take any action that he or she deems
       appropriate. Such actions include, but are not limited to the following:
           3.5.2.2.1. Any action that 423 ABG/CD could have taken.
           3.5.2.2.2. Meeting with the sponsor, sponsor’s commander and the family member who is
           the subject of the misconduct.
           3.5.2.2.3. Convening the FMMB
       3.5.2.3. If the act of misconduct involves a violation of host nation law that may result in con-
       finement, 423 ABG/CC or 423 ABG/CD shall consult 501 CSW/JA prior to initiating action
       against the family member.
    3.5.3. Convening the Board.
       3.5.3.1. The Board will meet at the direction of 423 ABG/CC or 423 ABG/CD to hear miscon-

       mander/supervisor of the time and place of the hearing and the nature of the alleged miscon-
       duct. Active duty sponsors and a representative from their command shall appear at the Board
       hearing. The Board may conduct in absentia hearings and may consider a family member’s
       willful refusal to appear as a matter in aggravation in deciding upon its recommendation.
       3.5.3.5. 423 ABG/CD is the decision authority for all requests for delays of a scheduled hear-
       ing. Requests for a delay shall be delivered to 423 ABG/CD in writing and shall be no later
       than 10 calendar days from the day of notification. Delays will be granted only in extraordi-
       nary cases, or when the sponsor is TDY or otherwise unavailable.
    3.5.4. Board Hearings.
       3.5.4.1. The FMMB is an administrative hearing, not a criminal court proceeding. Formal

        to submit written statements. The Board shall solicit and consider the sponsor’s recommenda-
        tion for corrective action.
        3.5.4.6. The Chairperson shall devise informal procedures to ensure all members of the Board

     actions (this list does not exclude any other permissible actions):
        3.5.5.1. An oral or written admonition or reprimand of the family member, the sponsor, or

        3.5.5.9. Restriction from base, except for medical and dental care. Medical and dental care are
        entitlements and may not be withdrawn. Only 501 CSW/CC may restrict someone from the
        installation and will decide the length of any barment based upon the facts of each case.
        3.5.5.10. Restriction from school or withdrawal of privilege to ride a school bus. NOTE: In

        sor does not cooperate, where circumstances prevent the expeditious early return of the family
        member, where rehabilitative measures have failed or where unusual hardship to the family
6                                                                     501CSWI51-901 29 JULY 2008


       will result from separation of one of more of its members from the sponsor. Such action will be
       considered to be in the best interest of the government.
       3.5.5.14. Referral of case to British authorities for prosecution.
    3.5.6. Nature of Corrective Action. The nature of the corrective action imposed should be evalu-
    ated in light of such factors as the individual’s age and prior disciplinary record, seriousness of the
    misconduct, deliberateness of the misconduct, defiance of authority, presence or absence of adult
    guidance and discipline, sanctions administered in like cases, adverse impact on Air Force or base
    community, impact of the misconduct on the victim and the rehabilitative potential of the offender.
    3.5.7. Decision.

       3.5.7.3. 423 ABG/CD shall record the command action on memorandum for record.
       3.5.7.4. If the sponsor or family member refuses to consent to community service, restitution,
       referral to another agency, early return to CONUS or any other corrective action, 423 ABG/CC
       may reconsider the matter, taking the refusal into account.
       3.5.7.5. If community service is a portion of the corrective action directed by 423 ABG/CC or
       423 ABG/CD, the family member shall coordinate the specific service and completion of the
       requisite hours with the 423 ABG First Sergeant or other person designated by 423 ABG/CD.
       The First Sergeant or designated person shall report completion to 423 ABG/CD. Failure to
       perform assigned duties shall result in no creditable hours and may result in further adminis-
       trative actions.
       3.5.7.6. 501 CSW/CC is the approval authority for all recommendations for restrictions. This
       authority is not delegable.
       3.5.7.7. Each agency to which a family member is referred is responsible for reporting its
       progress to 423 ABG/CD. If progress is unsatisfactory, 423 ABG/CD may recommend further
       action to 423 ABG/CC without convening the board.
    3.5.8. Appeals.
       3.5.8.1. A sponsor or a family member may appeal corrective actions imposed under the pro-
       visions of this instruction within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of notice of the com-
       mander’s decision. 423 ABG/CD may grant an exception to this deadline for good cause.
       3.5.8.2. Appeals shall be in writing and shall be indorsed by the sponsor. No personal appear-
       ances are permitted in conjunction with an appeal.
       3.5.8.3. Appeals may be based only on these grounds:
           3.5.8.3.1. Newly discovered evidence proves that the family member is innocent.
           3.5.8.3.2. Information showing mitigating circumstances was not available and therefore
           was not considered at the time of the initial action.

           3.5.8.3.3. Circumstances of personal or family hardship were not considered at the time of
           the initial action.
           3.5.8.3.4. Appeals shall be submitted to 423 ABG/CC for concurrence or non-concur-
           rence. 423 ABG/CC/CC shall then forward appeals to 501 CSW/CC for final action.
