SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: Updates reimbursement system (paragraph 2.2.); adds supporting information
(Attachment 1); and updates Accident Abuse Notification Letter (Attachment 3).
1. Objective.
     1.1. The objective of this policy is to ensure maximum life expectancy of limited
     government vehicle resources. Shrinking vehicle procurement budgets have dramatically
     limited the numbers and frequency of replacement vehicles. Vehicle accident and abuse
     repair expenditures place an unnecessary and preventable burden on already strained budgets.
     1.2. The keys to successfully reducing the number of accidents and abuses are to make base
     personnel aware of the high costs associated with these repairs and encourage commanders to
     maintain high standards of vehicle operator training and discipline.
     1.3. Funding these avoidable repairs with organizational budgets will ensure unit leadership
     involvement in establishing a viable squadron accident and abuse prevention program.
     Effective operator training and care programs will prevent needless repairs ultimately saving
     scarce wing funds while extending the service life of critical assets.
2. General.
     2.1. Vehicle Management is not funded for accident and abuse repairs. The unit responsible
     will bear material and/or contract costs regardless of determination of pecuniary liability or
     reimbursement made by an individual to the government.
     2.2. Responsible organizations will accomplish reimbursement through the use of their
     Government Purchase Card (GPC) or direct funds transfer from their operation and
     maintenance (O&M) account to the 374 LRS/LGRV O&M account. The unit’s resource
     advisor will be contacted to provide a line of accounting for vehicle repair funds.
     2.3. Where responsibility cannot be determined, the owning organization will be responsible
     for reimbursement. The owning organizations include temporary duty (TDY) units that
     utilize Vehicle Operation’s U-Drive-It fleet or recalled vehicles from Yokota’s vehicle fleet.
     TDY units will be pursued for reimbursement on accident/abuses.
     2.4. The 374th Mission Support Group Commander (374 MSG/CC) is the final decision
     authority to resolve any conflicts concerning this program.
3. Responsibilities.
     3.1. The 374 LRS will:
        3.1.1. Identify vehicle damage caused by accident, abuse or incident.
        3.1.2. Provide accident/abuse notification letter (Attachment 3) and photos to the
        squadron commander and VCO/VCNCO of the assigned organization (may not be the
        unit responsible for damage). A copy of the repair estimate work order may be provided
        upon request.
374AWI23-302 1 MARCH 2012                                                                    3


     3.1.3. Vehicle Management will ensure the most economical means are used to perform
     repairs without hampering higher priority mission requirements. Two repair options are
     available:
         3.1.3.1. In-house repairs dependant on adequate Vehicle Management manpower,
         paint booth facility availability and workload constraints.
         3.1.3.2. Contract repairs from local vendors.
     3.1.4. Maintain accident/abuse repair information for a 6-year period.
  3.2. Vehicle operator will:
     3.2.1. Stop and aid injured.
     3.2.2. Notify 374th Security Forces Squadron (374 SFS) immediately, prior to moving
     the vehicle.
     3.2.3. Notify supervisor and unit VCO.
     3.2.4. Complete Standard Form (SF) 91, Motor Vehicle Accident Report.
     3.2.5. Complete Department of Defense (DD) Form 518, Accident-Identification Card, if
     Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) or private property is involved.
  3.3. Assigned or using organization will:
     3.3.1. Report all vehicle damage to 374 LRS/LGRV within 24 hours if the vehicle can be
     driven safely. 374 LRS Vehicle Operations Flight (374 LRS/LGRO) will recover all
     non-drivable vehicles using a military wrecker. The initial responsibility to identify and
     report accidents rests with the vehicle operator.
     3.3.2. Report U-Drive-It or loaned vehicle damage to 374 LRS/LGRO within 24 hours.
     3.3.3. Conduct a preliminary investigation to ascertain the facts of vehicle damage or
     loss, and process the results of the investigation IAW AFMAN 23-220, Chapter 18.
  3.4. For accidents involving POVs:
     3.4.1. The assigned or using organization will inform Vehicle Management that the
     damage was a result of a POV/GOV accident.
     3.4.2. Ensure that copies of accident reports along with witness statements are submitted
     to 374 AW Staff Judge Advocate (374 AW/JA) no later than three days after GOV
     accidents involving POVs occur.
     3.4.3. The assigned or using organization will provide 374 AW/JA with sufficient
     information about the accident so that 374 AW/JA may adjudicate the claim. If the POV
     driver is determined to be at fault, 374 AW/JA will aggressively assert the government’s
     interest in pursuing payment/repairs from the liable POV driver.
     3.4.4. Documentation of GOV damages involving a POV will be forwarded to 374
     AW/JA and Vehicle Management will repair the GOV on a schedule as determined by
     the appropriate vehicle maintenance/repair authority.

                             EXAMPLES OF VEHICLE ABUSE

A2.1. Vehicle Maintenance will initiate vehicle abuse action for vehicle/equipment damage or
failure resulting from:
   A2.1.1. Tampering with governors, distributors or other engine/drivetrain components.
   A2.1.2. Operating vehicle with insufficient oil, coolant, etc. because operator failed to check
   levels according to established requirements, or failure to monitor dash instrumentation.
   A2.1.3. Operating vehicle with applied/dragging parking brakes.
   A2.1.4. Improper distribution or securing of loads in vehicle cargo areas or not following
   established loading and unloading procedures.
   A2.1.5. Using a vehicle for other than its intended or designed purpose (i.e., 6K F/L used to
   transport a 10,000 pound pallet).
   A2.1.6. Failure to clean/maintain vehicle’s interior/exterior to meet corrosion control and
   appearance requirements.
   A2.1.7. Unauthorized wiring, marking, or equipment add-on/modification of a vehicle

    A2.2.1. Failure to report discrepancies in any of the safety-type systems or devices described
    in AFI 23-302, paragraph 3.12., that could adversely affect the safety of personnel or the
    operation of equipment.
    A2.2.2. Failure to report damage (accident, incident, and negligence) to Vehicle
    Management within 24 hours. The VFM/VMS can pre-approve delays of this action to
    satisfy immediate mission needs when warranted.
    A2.2.3. Failure to accomplish proper operator care and maintenance.
    A2.2.4. Failure to bring vehicle/equipment in for scheduled maintenance before an overdue
    condition exists. An approved rescheduling by Vehicle Management due to mission
