    18TH WING COMMANDER HAS
            DIRECTED
                 STORM WATCH
 Winds are not forecast to exceed 50 knots (the criteria for “destructive winds”)
   but there still exists a probability of high winds due to the proximity of the
storm. The storm is also close enough to the area that a heightened alert status is
necessary in order to rapidly establish regular TCCOR condition should the storm
  deviate from the forecast track. Personnel should follow Standard Operating
   Procedures for TCCOR Storm Watch and stay alert for any changes to TCCOR
                                        status.

                              ACTIONS
 Personnel should remain alert, monitor radio and television, as rapid
                       changes could occur
