                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Introduction. The Incirlik Confinement Facility rulebook/handbook applies only to the
inmate, not the confinement staff. The confinement staff enforces the rules and regulations. It is
also each inmate’s responsibility to ensure that they expend every effort to derive all possible
benefit from the programs available.
     1.1.1. Evaluation of conduct is based on how closely the rules and regulations contained in
     this rule book and other directives are followed. Inmates must study it and ask questions if
     they have any. There are three very important rules which demand absolute
     compliance: You will not escape or attempt to escape, you will not possess contraband,
     and you will maintain good order and discipline at all times. Any violations of the rules
     and regulations concerning these actions are considered to be a direct threat against the basic
     operation of the facility and will be dealt with accordingly as outlined in AFI 31-205, The Air
     Force Corrections System.
     1.1.2. This handbook is designed to help you understand what is required and know what is
     available for your benefit while confined in this facility. It contains the various procedures
     and rules to be followed by all inmates. This hand book is assigned to you, it must be
     returned upon your release or transfer and you will be responsible for its maintenance. Do
     not write on or make any stray marks in this hand book.
     1.1.3. The Confinement Officer directs the operation of the confinement facility. Our
     assigned custodial staff personnel are representatives of the Air Base Wing Commander and
     Defense Force Commander. You will respect and obey their lawful orders without question
     regardless of rank.
     1.1.4. All the processing you undergo is required by regulation. Be cooperative with the
     custodial personnel who process you and be truthful in all your answers. Untrue statements
     will not help you in any way and may cause a delay in obtaining your release from
     confinement.
     1.1.5. In-processing Period: The first few days will be the most difficult period of your stay.
     During this period you will be placed into administrative segregation for 72 hours. This
     allows you the time to adjust to a controlled, disciplined way of life as well as allowing you
     to read and fully understand the topics contained in this book. As a new arrival, you will be
     in-processed, informed of confinement rules and procedures, and briefed about the
     opportunities available here for self-improvement. Staff personnel will interview you and
     you will complete paperwork, which will be used to assign work details and design an
     individual program suited to your needs and capabilities. This information may be provided
     if you request consideration for clemency, restoration and parole if you are eligible. It is to
     your advantage to be cooperative and truthful.
1.2. This booklet is provided for your information, guidance, and adherence. You must
comply with all of the material contained in it. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action
being taken against you. The term rule book and handbook within this document are
synonymous. You will become thoroughly familiar with the contents of this booklet and
maintain it in excellent condition. While you are confined, make the most of the confinement
INCIRLIKABI31-105V2 5 JULY 2013                                                            5


program. Exercising common sense and good judgment is imperative. We are hopeful you will
do everything possible to expedite your rehabilitation for return to duty and useful pursuits
through a positive approach.

                                              Chapter 2

                                   CUSTODY AND CONTROL

2.1. Military Courtesy and Bearing:
     2.1.1. Rules of courtesy are soundly based on customs and traditions and their strict
     observance. They are an important part of the maintenance of good discipline and high
     morale. Inmates will maintain military bearing and will extend all customs and courtesies to
     stall personnel. Staff personnel will be addressed as “Sir/Ma’am”, “Sergeant”, etc”. Do
     NOT use slang or abbreviated titles.
     2.1.2. Reporting. When inmates report or are directed to report to any staff member or
     visiting official, they will report utilizing military protocol. Inmates will come to the position
     of attention and state “Sir/Ma’am, inmate (name) reports as ordered.” Inmates will not use
     their hands when communicating with staff or interrupt staff members at any time.
     2.1.3. Guard Entry. Prior to opening the confinement door, the guard will call out “On-
     Line” at which time all inmates will stand at attention behind the red line on the floor directly
     in front of the door. Segregated inmates will stand at the foot of their bed. When all inmates
     are “On-Line” and can be seen through the window, the guard will then open the door. All
     inmates will remain “On-Line” at the position of attention until the door is closed and locked
     or until told to “Carry-On” by the guard. Any inmate who steps “Off-Line” before the door
     is closed or before being told to do so will be considered as attempting an escape.
2.2. Inmate:
     2.2.1. Saluting. Unless it degrades security, unrestrained inmates are not denied the
     privilege of rendering the hand salute when appropriate. Inmates will also salute when
     reporting to an officer.
     2.2.2. Giving Way and Overtaking. When walking on the sidewalk or down a hallway,
     inmates will stay on the right side unless directed otherwise. If a staff member or anyone
     else is in an inmate’s path, they will step to the right and state “Excuse me, Sir/Ma’am” and
     then step back and proceed to the next red line or destination. Inmates will not walk behind
     guards while the guard is searching an inmate, or walk up on a guard unannounced.
     2.2.3. Head Covering. Inmates shall wear the appropriate head covering at all times when
     outside except when participating in physical training. Inmates will put their cover on once
     they exit a building and take it off as soon as they enter.
     2.2.4. Contraband. Any article not authorized to be in an inmate’s possession, any item
     authorized but that has been modified for a use other than that originally intended, or excess
     of an authorized item is contraband. Contraband found on an inmate’s person, in his or her
     cell, or at his or her place of work and not specifically authorized for use will be confiscated
     and result in disciplinary action. Inmates are allowed to have only the personal articles or
     government property listed as authorized in the Handbook. Methods used to control
     contraband are metal detectors, military working dogs, frisk searches, strip searches upon
     entering or leaving the facility, locker, cell and work area shakedowns, etc.
INCIRLIKABI31-105V2 5 JULY 2013                                                                7


   2.2.5. Mingling With the Opposite Sex. Due to the limited space available at the Incirlik
   Confinement Facility, there may be times where you are in close proximity to an inmate of
   the opposite sex. You will conduct yourself in a professional manner. There will be no
   physical contact between inmates of the opposite sex. Inmates of the opposite sex are not
   allowed into the other’s sleeping areas. The only area where inmates of the opposite sex may
   mingle without escort is the dayroom.
2.3. Searches and Shakedowns:
   2.3.1. Searches. Upon initial confinement, inmates will be searched, including a complete
   search of all personal gear. All inmates will turn in all items they know or suspect is
   unauthorized. All unauthorized items will be disposed of properly or sent out of the facility
   to a place the inmate designates. While in this facility, inmates will be subject to search at
   various times and inmates may not refuse to be searched. Inmates are expected to cooperate
   fully and not make comments while being searched. Random strip searches may be
   conducted at any time.
   2.3.2. Shakedowns. Inmate’s cell, locker, and personal area will be shaken down at random
   times to ensure the area is free of contraband. Shakedowns are not announced and the
   inmate’s presence is not necessary for a shakedown to be conducted. Inmates will follow the
   directions given by the staff members conducting the shakedown. Any gear left unattended
   will be confiscated.
2.4. Inmate Movement:
   2.4.1. Inmate Movements. All inmate movements will be accomplished in a military
   manner. Upon being approached by an officer outside of the facility, ensure you render
   proper military customs and courtesies. All movements will be by the most direct route.
   There will be no loitering or talking unless questioned by the escort. While standing by for
   further instructions you will stand in front of the escort at the position of parade rest.
   2.4.2. Rules of Conduct. There are three very important rules which demand absolute
   compliance:
      2.4.2.1. You will not escape or attempt to escape.
      2.4.2.2. You will not possess contraband.
      2.4.2.3. You will maintain good order and discipline at all times.
   2.4.3. Disobedience. Verbal orders by staff members or written orders are not subject to
   argument, discussion, or bargaining. Orders will be obeyed immediately and without
   question. If inmates feel they have been given an unlawful order, they may submit a
   complaint, via DD Form 510, Request for Interview, after the order has been carried out. In
   the case of conflicting orders, inmates will obey the last order given.
   2.4.4. Provocation. Inmates will never argue in any manner with staff, in the presence of
   staff, or use provoking, argumentative, lewd, indecent, insulting, or threatening language or
   gestures. The excuse of talking to yourself or another inmate is not acceptable.
   2.4.5. Assault. Inmates will not assault, attempt to injure, touch with any object, lay hands
   on, scuffle with, or brush against staff or other personnel.

     2.4.6. Noise. You will refrain from the use of loud or obscene language, singing, whistling,
     or other loud noises that will disturb other inmates and staff.
     2.4.7. Physical contact. Physical contact between an inmate and any other individual is
     prohibited except as specifically authorized and necessary to complete a detail. Brief
     physical contact between an inmate and visitor before and after visitation is allowed.
     2.4.8. Valuables. You are not allowed to have money, jewelry (other than a wedding band,
     watch, or religious medallion), or other negotiable items, to include postage stamps, in your
     possession at any time. You must turn in any items mentioned above to staff personnel
     immediately. Items will be receipted for, via AF Form 807, Receipt-Inmate’s Personal
     Property and placed with your personal property until your release or transfer.
     2.4.9. You will not accept or give to visitors any gifts, notes, mail, money or any other item
     of any kind during visitation.
     2.4.10. You will not gamble, trade, buy, give, or sell any items to an inmate or any other
     person.
     2.4.11. Daytime Rules: Sleeping, lying or sitting on bunks will not be allowed during duty
     hours without authorization from the Confinement Officer or NCOIC or proper medical
     personnel Sleeping on or lying on floors is not authorized at any time. Inmates with a
     medical profile or on bed rest will have a medical statement from the physician in their
     possession. On weekends and holidays, inmates will be allowed to sleep until 0600 hours.
     All inmates will be required to get up, make their bed, and straighten their area. During free
     time, inmates are allowed to wear gym or shower shoes in place of boots as long as they
     remain in the confinement area. If for any reason an inmate has to leave the confinement
     area, boots will be put back on except for emergencies. Inmates are not allowed to walk
     around inside the confinement area barefoot or wearing only socks.
     2.4.12. Night time rules: During sleeping hours, all unnecessary noise will cease. There
     will be no talking or walking in the dayroom area. No writing or reading is permitted during
     lights out. All inmates are required to sleep with their heads uncovered. Inmates will not
     sleep in uniform. Underclothing will be worn. SLEEPING IN THE NUDE IS

  these rights, inmates must know their responsibilities. All inmates must become familiar
  with both rights and responsibilities afforded them to help ensure their confinement is as
  pleasant as possible. The confinement staff has the sole responsibility to determine misuse or
  abuse. Any failure to comply with the instructions set forth in this Handbook WILL NOT
  BE TOLERATED.
