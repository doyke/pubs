        obtain a “Meet Me” number through local communications procedures.
635SCOWI33-301 24 OCTOBER 2013                                                                  5


      6.1.2. DCO. This is the DOD approved on-line collaborative tool. It provides visual
      and/or voice connectivity to all parties. This is an inexpensive way to quickly conduct
      meetings that require sharing of presentations or face-to-face contact. The tool can be
      reached at the following link: https://www.dco.dod.mil/private/dsp/my_dco.cfm.
      6.1.3. VTC. If VTC is required, the meeting host is required to arrange the VTC and
      provide the information to all participants. Information will also be sent to the 635
      SCOW/VTC Facilitator.
      6.1.4. TDY. TDYs will be accomplished only when a face-to-face meeting is essential
      to outcome. All TDYs will be approved in advance via the TDY Request form (located
      on 635 SCOW SharePoint). Traveler (or team lead, if more than one traveler) will route
      a completed TDY Request form, to include a copy of the draft DTS travel order to their
      supervisor, 635 SCOW/FM, and 635 SCOW/DV, in turn. The 635 SCOW/DV will
      return approved TDY Request form to the traveler for inclusion in TDY order as a
      supporting documentation. Disapproved TDY Request forms are returned to traveler and
      635 SCOW/FM.
7. Personnel Management.
   7.1. Groups will establish procedures for personnel accountability to include in-processing
   and out-processing of all personnel (military civilian and contractors) vacancies and over hire
   tracking personnel moves, etc.
   7.2. Group manpower and personnel POCs will notify 635 SCOW/OM of all new civilian
   and contractor gains within 5 duty days of their selection date.
   7.3. Group manpower and personnel POCs will complete monthly updates on Organization
   Health Spreadsheet on SharePoint.
   7.4. Civilian vacancy and over hires. IAW AFMC guidelines no position in the 635 SCOW
   may remain vacant for more than 30 calendar days without authorization or an active Request
   for Personnel Action (RPA) (active is defined as being submitted for action) except in times
   of manpower controls or hiring freezes.
      7.4.1. Civilian employees will notify their supervisor as soon as possible IAW union
      agreement of their intent to vacate a position so actions can be taken to fill the vacancy.
      Employees will out-process the unit.
          7.4.1.1. Employees accepting employment with another federal agency need to
          ensure the agency notifies the local Civilian Personnel Office (CPO) to initiate
          actions to transfer records including unused leave balances.
          7.4.1.2. Employees resigning/separating from federal service will send an email to
          their supervisor stating their intention and will include effective date and forwarding
          address. This is not intended to replace face-to-face notification but will be used as
          official notification for attachment to the RPA.
      7.4.2. Supervisors are to complete and submit to their manpower and personnel point of
      contact (POC) the current RPA checklist with desired action/instructions no later than 5
      duty days after an employee provides notification to vacate a position. Positions
      requiring a position description (PD) rewrite must be completed no later than 25 calendar
      days after vacancy.

    7.4.3. Wing and group manpower and personnel POCs will process RPA actions within
    two duty days of receipt.
       7.4.3.1. Over hire management. Use of over hires will be minimal IAW Air Force
       Materiel Command (AFMC) guidelines except where specific exceptions have been
       authorized. An AFSC request form is required to be approved by the 635 SCOW/OM
       and DV prior to recruitment of an over hire position. Requests are then routed
       through AFSC/DP for final approval.
    7.4.4. Unit manpower document change requests (ACR) must be approved by Group
    CC/DD prior to submission to 635 SCOW/OM. ACRs must be submitted in accordance
    with the AFSC and AFMC guidance. System Access Request (SAR) code changes must
    also be approved by the unit security manager.
