  General -- The Inspection System, 26 April 2006, Air Force Instruction (AFI) 90-201, Inspector
  General Activities, 17 June 2009, and AFI 90-201_AFGSCSUP, Addendum J, Unit Compliance
  Inspections (UCI), 1 February 2010. This checklist reflects command Antiterrorism (AT)
  Program management requirements to prepare for and conduct unit self-inspections. It
  complements AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism, and implements the guidance found in AFI 90-201,
  Inspector General Activities, and the Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) supplement to
  it. Effective unit self-inspections serve as the foundation for commanders to ensure compliance
  with governing directives. It applies to HQ AFGSC, it’s Numbered Air Forces (NAF), their
  assigned Wings and those AFGSC units tenant on other command or service installations. It does
  not apply to AFGSC-gained Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) or Air National Guard (ANG)
  units; operational control of the AFRC and ANG gained units’ AT program remains with the
  AFRC and/or ANG. All AFRC and ANG units required to report AT program status/measures
  will continue to process their information through their headquarters. Gained AFRC and ANG
  units may utilize this supplement to assist their AT program management.

OVERVIEW
This checklist is new and should be reviewed in its entirety. All references reflect current
publications. Inspection Checklists are the primary lists used during the HQ AFGSC/IG UCI.

1. References have been provided for all items. Critical items have been kept to a minimum
and are related to public law, safety, security, fiscal responsibility and/or mission
accomplishment.

2. This publication establishes a baseline guide to be used by units during their self-inspection
process. The AFGSC/IG will use this checklist during applicable assessments. Items designated
as Critical require direct IG evaluation per AFI 90-201. Non-critical items will be evaluated as
time permits. Non-compliance with an item designated as Critical does not necessarily equate to
a critical deficiency during an IG inspection. Attention to non-critical items helps gauge the
effectiveness and efficiency of the unit. AFGSC checklists will not be supplemented. Units
should produce their own stand-alone checklists, as needed, to ensure an effective and thorough
review of the unit program. See Attachment 1.

      ______________________________________________________________________________

      This guidance implements Air Force Policy Directive 90-2, Inspector General – The Inspection
      System, and supports Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) Supplement (Sup) 1 to Air
      Force Instruction (AFI) 90-201, Inspector General Activities. It applies to HQ AFGSC, it’s
      Numbered Air Forces (NAF), their assigned Wings and those AFGSC units tenant on other
      command or service installations. It does not apply to AFGSC-gained Air Force Reserve
      Command (AFRC) or Air National Guard (ANG) units; operational control of the AFRC and
      ANG gained units’ AT program remains with the AFRC and/or ANG. All AFRC and ANG units
      required to report AT program status/measures will continue to process their information through
      their headquarters. Gained AFRC and ANG units may utilize this supplement to assist their AT
      program management. This checklist is designed to assist in preparation for a Unit Compliance
      Inspection, and is not intended as the sole source of guidance for program management, but
      should be used in conjunction with AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism, and the detailed regulations
      referenced below:
