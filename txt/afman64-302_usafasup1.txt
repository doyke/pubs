ment Policy, October 2, 1981, in all Air Force Academy Athletic Association (AFAAA) NAF contracts:
6.1.1. (Added) Disputes (USAFA FEB 2000) - Except as otherwise provided in this contract, any dispute
or claim concerning this contract that is not disposed of by agreement shall be decided by the Contracting

Within 90 days from the date of receipt of such copy, the Contractor may appeal by mailing or otherwise
furnishing to the Contracting Officer a written appeal addressed to the Armed Services Board of Contract
Appeals, and the decision of the Board shall be final and conclusive; provided that if no such appeal is
filed, the decision of the Contracting Officer shall be final and conclusive. (See Attachment 4 (Added)
through Attachment 6 (Added) for contracts.)
6.1.2. (Added) Legal Status (USAFA FEB 2000) - The NAFI is an integral part of the Department of
Defense and is an instrumentality of the United States Government. Therefore, NAFI contracts are United
States Government contracts; however, they do not obligate appropriated funds of the United States.
6.1.3. (Added) Examination of Records (USAFA FEB 2000) – a. This clause is applicable if the amount of
this contract exceeds $10,000 and the contract was entered into by means of negotiation. The Contractor

period of the contract and until the expiration of 3 years after the final payment under the contract. b. The

the AFAAA. If this contract is for supplies and is so terminated, the Contractor shall be compensated in
accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2 in effect on this contract’s date. To the extent that this con-
tract is for services and is so terminated, the AFAAA shall be liable only for payment in accordance with
the payment provisions of this contract for services rendered prior to the effective date of termination,

any such Contractor claims, they shall be settled in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2. The
rights and remedies of the AFAAA in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided
by law or under this contract.

6.1.6. (Added) Equal Opportunity Clause - Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.222-26. The current clause
at the time of contact award is to be used.

ing: NAF Contracting Office, NAF Accounting Office, NAFI (Athletic Department), and Contractor.
11.15. (Added) Air Force Academy Athletic Association (AFAAA). The AFAAA is a NAFI autho-
rized and established for the purpose of providing supplemental support to the USAF Academy’s Athletic
Program. The AFAAA is under the direct control of the USAFA Superintendent who has authority, as the
head of the Contracting Activity, to establish contracting activities and delegate broad authority to man-
age the AFAAA's contracting functions to heads of USAFA NAF contracting activities and the USAFA’s
Servicing Contracting Office (SCO).
11.15.1. (Added) Pursuant to the authority in paragraph 11.15. (Added), the USAFA Superintendent has
determined that all AFAAA contracts listed in paragraphs 11.15.1.1. (Added) – 11.15.1.3. (Added) shall
be entered into and signed on behalf of the AFAAA only by contracting officers from the USAFA SCO.
These contracts may be entered into noncompetitively. The Contracting Officer is responsible for ensur-
ing fair and reasonable consideration for each party. The Contracting Officer that issued the contract or his
or her successor will make all modifications or amendments to those agreements.
11.15.1.1. (Added) AFAAA individual service contracts, such as with coaches, assistant coaches, and
AFAAA support personnel.
11.15.1.2. (Added) Partnership Agreements. These are defined as a negotiated arrangement between the
AFAAA and another entity for an exchange of funds, goods or services as part of the AFAAA’s nonappro-
priated fund support activities.
11.15.1.3. (Added) AFAAA Athletic Contest Agreements.
11.15.2. (Added) Since intercollegiate sports programs have an established set of customs and practices
regarding contract negotiations and commitments, it is understood that Athletic Department personnel
will actively assist in recruiting, establishing game schedules, and establishing partnership arrangements.

specific contracting procedures that streamline negotiation, award, and administration of contracting
operations to ensure timely and efficient service for the AFAAA;

_______________(hereafter called the Contractor) shall commence on _______________ and termi-
nate on ________________.
WITNESS that:
WHEREAS the parties hereto desire to contract for (Position), as more particularly described in Appen-
dix A.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of mutual covenants and agreements between the parties hereto, it
is agreed as follows:
    1. Performance of Service: The Contractor agrees to perform services at prices set forth in Appendix
        A. The AFAAA will not be liable for any costs incurred by the Contractor other than those speci-
        fied in Appendix A.
    2. Payments: In consideration for the services to be rendered, the AFAAA agrees to pay the Contrac-
        tor the amount specified in Appendix A. The rate to be paid the Contractor under the terms of this
        contract shall not exceed the amount stipulated in Appendix A, unless otherwise specified by a
        modification or addendum to this contract. This contract is solely the obligation of the AFAAA
        and the Contractor and is not an obligation of appropriated funds of the U.S. Government. When
        authorized by the AFAAA, the Contractor will be paid per diem at the Government rate for each
        day the Contractor is in travel status and such other travel expenses as may be approved by the
        AFAAA.
    3. No Employer-Employee Relationship: It is understood that this contract does not create an
        employer/employee relationship and, as such, the Contractor is not subject to Air Force nonappro-
        priated fund (NAF) rules, regulations, and policies governing NAF employment.
    4. Licenses, Taxes, Permits, and Fees: The Contractor is fully cognizant that this is a contract for
        individual/professional services and that an employer-employee relationship does not exist
        between the Contractor and the AFAAA. Therefore, it is the Contractor's responsibility to obtain,
        at his or her own expense, all licenses and permits and to pay taxes and fees as may be required of
        the Contractor by the federal, state, and local governments in the execution of this contract.
    5. Hold and Save Harmless: The Contractor agrees to indemnify, save harmless, and defend the
        AFAAA from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, debts, liabilities, and attorney's
        fees arising out of, claimed on account of, or in any manner predicated upon loss of or damage to
        the property of, and injuries to or death of any and all persons or entities (including AFAAA)
        whatsoever, in any manner caused, or contributed to by the negligence of or intentional acts of the
        Contractor, his or her agents, servants or employees.
AFMAN64-302_USAFASUP1 7 DECEMBER 00                                                                      13

  6. Obligation on the Part of the Contractor: During the term of the contract, the Contractor shall
      ensure that his or her contract obligations are completed in full without interference from commit-
      ments to organizations other than the AFAAA.
  7. Information Security: The Contractor agrees that any information received in the course of this
      contract concerning the business or activities of the AFAAA shall be kept in the strictest confi-
      dence for the sole benefit of the AFAAA. In the absence of authority from the AFAAA, the Con-
      tractor will not divulge or publish such information either during or subsequent to the contract.
  8. Termination (USAFA FEB 2000): The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this
      contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the best interest of the AFAAA; e.g.; the liquidation of
      the AFAAA. If this contract is for supplies and is so terminated, the Contractor shall be compen-
      sated in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2 in effect on this contract’s date. To the
      extent that this contract is for services and is so terminated, the AFAAA shall be liable only for
      payment in accordance with the payment provisions of this contract for services rendered prior to
      the effective date of termination, providing there are no Contractor claims covering nonrecurring
      costs for capital investment. If there are any such Contractor claims, they shall be settled in accor-
      dance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2. The rights and remedies of the AFAAA in this clause
      are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.
  9. Legal Status (USAFA FEB 2000): The NAFI is an integral part of the Department of Defense and
      is an instrumentality of the United States Government. Therefore, NAFI contracts are United
      States Government contracts; however, they do not obligate appropriated funds of the United
      States.
  10. Termination by Mutual Agreement: This contract may be terminated by either party upon mutu-
      ally agreed terms. Additionally, unless compelling circumstances are present, AFAAA will not
      agree to less than 60 days notice of termination. Unless otherwise stated in any termination agree-
      ment, termination will be without prejudice to any cause of action which either party may have
      arising out of breach of this contract occurring prior to such termination. Unless otherwise stated
      in any termination agreement, payments and benefits under the contract will be prorated as of the
      date of termination, and all parties shall be relieved of any further obligations. If the Contractor
      vacates this position without giving notice of termination and, therefore, without agreement by
      AFAAA to termination terms, the Contractor hereby agrees to any reasonable termination terms
      that AFAAA may impose.
  11. Termination for Cause - In the event this contract is terminated in whole or in part for cause, the
      Contracting Officer may acquire goods or services similar to those affected by the termination
      from another source and the Contractor will be liable for any excess costs incurred by the AFAAA
      in doing so
  12. Disputes (USAFA FEB 2000): Except as otherwise provided in this contract, any dispute or claim
      concerning this contract that is not disposed of by agreement shall be decided by the Contracting
      Officer who shall issue a decision, in writing, and mail or otherwise furnish a copy of it to the
      Contractor. Within 90 days from the date of receipt of such copy, the Contractor may appeal by
      mailing or otherwise furnishing to the Contracting Officer a written appeal addressed to the
      Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals, and the decision of the Board shall be final and con-
      clusive; provided that if no such appeal is filed, the decision of the Contracting Officer shall be
      final and conclusive.

     13. Examination of Records (USAFA FEB 2000): a. This clause is applicable if the amount of this
         contract exceeds $10,000 and the contract was entered into by means of negotiation. The Contrac-
         tor agrees that the Contracting Officer, AFAAA Athletic Director or his or her duly authorized
         representative shall have the right to examine and audit the books and records of the Contractor
         that directly pertain to this contract during the period of the contract and until the expiration of 3
         years after the final payment under the contract. b. The Contractor agrees to include the clause in
         “a” above in all subcontracts hereunder which exceed $10,000.
     14. Equal Opportunity (USAFA FEB 2000): The Equal Opportunity Clause found in Federal Acquisi-
         tion Regulation 52.222-26 is incorporated by reference into this contract and has full force and
         effect.
     15. Compliance with Rules & Regulations: The Contractor agrees to fully comply with all applicable
         rules established by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Additionally, the Con-
         tractor, unless specified by written authorization, shall not act as an agent of the AFAAA nor have
         authority to bind the AFAAA on any contract for procurement of equipment, supplies, or services,
         nor any authority to obligate the AFAAA, its funds, officers, or members on any matter with any
         person. Unauthorized representation of authority by the Contractor causing third parties to rely
         thereon shall be, if obligation results, solely the obligation of the Contractor in his or her individ-
         ual capacity and not the obligation of the AFAAA.
     16. Athletically Related Income: The Contractor shall not engage in any athletically related income
         producing activities and/or receive athletically related benefits from sources outside the AFAAA
         without the prior written approval of the Superintendent. Approval by the AFAAA will normally
         not be withheld except for reasons of propriety or probably adverse publicity which might unfa-
         vorably reflect directly or indirectly upon the AFAAA or the USAF. Prior written approval will be
         obtained for the following types of benefits/income:
         a. Income from annuities;
         b. Sports camps;
         c. Housing benefits (including preferential housing arrangements);
         d. Country club memberships;
         e. Complimentary ticket sales;
         f. Television and radio programs;
         g. Endorsement or consultation contracts with athletic shoe, apparel or equipment manufactur-
             ers; and,
         h. Other athletically related income/benefits.
     17. * Expense Accounts: In addition to the payment for services specified in Appendix A, The Con-
         tractor is authorized an expense account of $______per month. Authorized expenditures include
         those for______________. The Contractor will pay all authorized expense account charges and
         be reimbursed upon submission of a signed request for reimbursement which identifies the pur-
         pose and amount of each expenditure with supporting documentation. The Contractor will not be
         reimbursed for unauthorized expenditures or expenditures in excess of the dollar amount of the
         expense account specified above.
