2.1. Runway Description. Runway (RWY) 5/23: A single runway, 12,501 feet long and 200
feet wide, 50 foot shoulders, with 1,000 foot asphalt overrun at each end of the runway. The
overruns are not stressed for takeoff or landing. (See Attachment 4, Grissom Aerodrome). The
runway gradient is 0.1%.
2.2. Runway Selection Procedures. See para 4-13.
2.3. Field Elevation. 812 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL).
2.4. Airport/Runway Lighting. Runway 5, US standard (A-1) approach lights 3,000 feet long.
Runway 23, US standard (A-1) approach lights 2,400 feet long. Sequence flashing lights to both
runways, Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) to both runways, High Intensity Runway
Lights (HIRLS) to both runways, taxiway lighting, and airport rotating beacon.
2.5. Runway Lighting Requirements.
     2.5.1. Federal Aviation Administration Order (FAAO) 7110.65, air traffic control procedures
     contain the standards for operation of airport lighting. These procedures will apply except as
     stated in the following paragraphs:
     2.5.2. When the prevailing visibility is one mile or less or whenever Runway Visual Range
     (RVR) is affected, the base weather station shall be informed of all changes to runway light
     settings. This procedure is required to support the RVR computer. This ensures that the 1 –
     minute RVR that is based on the HIRL setting of 3, 4, or 5 represents the existing RVR.
     2.5.3. When the Approach Lighting System (ALS) to either runway fails, no light landing
     minimums are specified in DoD Flight Information Publication (Terminal) (FLIPS).
     2.5.4. Airfield management shall issue a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) stating the Approach
     Light System (ALS) is out of service when the ALS fails on either runway.
     2.5.5. The Control Tower will broadcast the phrase ―no light minimums in effect‖ on the
     Automatic Terminal Information System (ATIS) when the ALS is out of service.
     2.5.6. Air Traffic Control (ATC) shall ensure affected aircraft have been advised to apply
     no-light minimums.
     2.5.7. Approach and taxiway lights will be left on during snow removal operations. Runway
     lights will be turned on to the brilliance setting (5) when requested by snow removal
     supervisor or airfield management.
     2.5.8. There is no requirement to operate Airport/Runway lighting after normal hours of
     operation (0700-2300L). In the event a requirement exists to operate Airport/Runway
     lighting, coordination will be effected between ATC, Airfield Management, and the agency
     requiring such operation.
2.6. CMA (See attachment 4). The Controlled Movement Area (CMA) includes runway 5/23,
overruns, and 100’ either side of runway and overrun edges. Personnel operating in these areas
must be in two-way radio communication with the Grissom Control Tower. In the event a non-
radio equipped vehicle requires access into the CMA, entry must be pre-coordinated between the
434ARWI13-201 25 JULY 2011                                                                    9


agency and Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS). All vehicles entering the CMA must
have two way radio contact with the Control Tower at all times. A non-radio vehicle can be
escorted into the CMA the vehicle doing the escorting must have radio contact with the Control
Tower and notify the Control Tower that they are escorting a vehicle without a radio. The non-
radio equipped vehicle driver must be familiar with the Control Tower light gun signals. These

   movements on the CMA. In the event two-way radio contact is lost the Control Tower will:
       2.6.1.1. Flash the runway/taxiway lights to get vehicles/personnel’s attention. This is a
       signal to personnel to exit the runway/taxiway immediately.
       2.6.1.2. Point and flash the appropriate Control Tower light gun signal directly to the
       vehicle.
   2.6.2. Personnel must be in direct contact with the Control Tower and shall request access
   onto the CMA prior to entering.
   2.6.3. Personnel operating unescorted, non-radio equipped vehicles will stop by Airfield
   Management Operations and request/secure a portable radio. Personnel will contact the
   Control Tower for access to the CMA prior to entering.
   2.6.4. Personnel losing radio contact with the Control Tower after having received clearance
   onto the CMA shall immediately exit the CMA by the quickest means possible.
   2.6.5. Personnel directed to exit the CMA by the Control Tower shall do so immediately by
   the shortest route. Personnel shall exercise extreme caution with regard for driving safety
   and will report when off the CMA.
   2.6.6. All vehicles operating in the CMA and overrun areas must have operable four way
   flashers and rotating beacon/emergency lights affixed to the vehicle roof. Non-emergency
   response vehicles will utilize yellow rotating beacons. Four way flashers and rotating
   beacon/emergency lights must be on when operating in the CMA or overrun areas.

   8.11.2. Types of BWC (Bird Watch Condition):
       8.11.2.1. SEVERE - High bird population on or immediately above the active runway or
       other specific location (i.e. arrival or departure corridor) that represents a high potential
       for strike. Supervisors and aircrews must thoroughly evaluate mission needs before
       conducting operations in areas under condition SEVERE. This is an abnormal bird
       condition indicating larger than typical birds or greatly increased numbers. TOWER
       ACTIONS: Takeoff and landings of aircraft other than locally assigned 434 ARW
       aircraft will be advised of the bird watch condition and takeoff or landing will be at their
       own risk.
       8.11.2.2. MODERATE - Increased bird population in locations that represents an
       increased potential for strike. This condition requires increased vigilance by all agencies
       and supervisors and caution by aircrews. This is an abnormal bird condition indicating
       larger than typical birds or increased numbers. TOWER ACTIONS: Multiple approach
       and traffic pattern activity for AFRC aircraft ceases. A departure and full stop approach
       is allowed if the departure and arrival route avoids identified bird activities. Formation
       takeoffs, approaches, and landings are prohibited for fighter-type aircraft.
       8.11.2.3. LOW - Normal bird activity on and above the airfield with a low probability of
       hazard. This is a normal bird condition indicating routine Indiana activity.

Operating Support Contracts (BOS).
Control Tower—A terminal facility that uses air/ground communications, visual signaling, and
other devices to provide ATC services to aircraft operating in the vicinity of an airport or on the
movement area. Authorizes aircraft to land or takeoff at the airport controlled by the tower or to
transit the Class Delta airspace area regardless of flight plan or weather conditions (IFR or VFR).
Controlled Movement Area (CMA)—Any portion of the airfield requiring aircraft, vehicles
and pedestrians to obtain specific air traffic control approval for access (normally via two-way
radio contact with the Control Tower). The CMA includes but is not limited to areas used for
takeoff, landing and as required taxiing aircraft.
Controlled Movement Area Violation—An airfield violation caused by aircraft, vehicles, or
pedestrians entering the controlled movement area without specific Control Tower approval.
This also includes runway intrusions and infractions caused by communication errors.
Deputy, Chief Airfield Manager (DCAMM)—A BOS contract function. Works directly for
the CAM and supervises flight line operations and airfield maintenance activities to ensure safe,

effective and efficient airfield operations. Functions under the governing directives of the BOS
contract.
Emergency—A distress or an urgency condition.
Foreign Object Debris Check—A vehicular check conducted by all personnel prior to entering
the ramp movement areas, ensuring that vehicular tires are free of foreign object debris. These
checks pertain to other areas of the airfield environment as well, which are normally conducted
by airfield management personnel; however, they pertain to all personnel operating within the
airfield environment. Additionally, conducted by airfield management personnel prior to the
start of normal flying activities or in response to Foreign Object Debris reports by the supervisor
of flying, Control Tower, aircraft, etc.
Hazardous Cargo—As a minimum includes ammunition, explosives, toxic, caustic, nuclear,
biological, infectious, poisonous, combustible, or flammable materials, which may endanger life
or property.
Instrument Flight Rules—A set of rules governing the conduct of flight under instrument
meteorological conditions.
Instrument Meteorological Conditions—Meteorological conditions expressed in terms of
visibility, distance from cloud, and ceiling less than the minima specified for visual
meteorological conditions.
Jettisoning of External Stores—Airborne release of fuel tanks, ordnance, rockets, flares, pods,
etc., carried externally on an aircraft and capable of being jettisoned.
Joint-use-Airfield—A United States AF installation where agreements exist between the AF,
civil and host nation authorities for joint use of all or a portion of airfield facilities.
KC-135—Includes all KC/KE/KR models. Model number will indicate references to specific
aircraft.
Miami County Economic Development Authority (MCEDA)—The civil competent authority
duly constituted under the laws of the State of Indiana, and recognized by the Secretary of
Defense as the redevelopment authority for the communities in the vicinity of the former
Grissom AFB, and as such, eligible to serve as the sponsor of a public airport under a JUA.
Operations Coordinator (OC)—A rated officer or airman authorized by the OG/CC to monitor
and supervise current flight operations. As required, an OC may perform duties from the Control
Tower. Function is same as Supervisor of Flying (SOF).
Radar Approach Control Facility—A terminal ATC facility that uses radar and non-radar
capabilities to provide approach control services to aircraft arriving, departing, or transiting
airspace controlled by the facility.
Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)—The official schedule that authorizes/governs the
disposition of Air Force records, which contains National Archives and Records Administration
(NARA) approval authority.
Runway (RWY)—A defined rectangular area on a land airport prepared for the landing and
takeoff run of aircraft along its length. Runways are normally numbered in relation to their
magnetic direction rounded off to the nearest 10 degrees; e.g., Runway 5 and Runway 23.
434ARWI13-201 25 JULY 2011                                                                      57


Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS)—Responsible for the development and
maintenance of the VFR and IFR procedures used by aircraft arriving, departing and practicing
flight in and around Grissom ARB. IFR procedures are developed to ensure the separation of
aircraft from obstacles and terrain throughout all phases of terminal flight. VFR procedures are
developed to provide aircraft procedures that do not meet IFR criteria, but can be safely flown in
Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) under VFR.
Threat Avoidance Arrival/Departure (TAAD) procedures—Flying procedures used primarily
when high/medium altitude landing is necessary; e.g., small arms environment and a permissive
high or medium altitude threat environment exists, thus allowing reconnaissance of the field
during the flyover. The procedures outlined herein are for locally assigned KC-135R aircraft
performing VFR Overhead Pattern, Random Steep Approach, Curvilinear Approach, Spiral-Up
Departure, and Low Altitude High Speed Departure procedures within the boundaries of
Grissom ARB Class Delta airspace.
Runway Intrusion—A controlled movement area violation that is the result of an unauthorized
entry or erroneous occupation of a runway or other surface used for takeoff and landing of
aircraft regardless of impact on aircraft safety. Aircraft, vehicles, pedestrians, or communication
errors between such can cause these incidents.
Uncontrolled Movement Areas—Taxiways except as defined in this instruction, and ramp
areas not under the control of air traffic Control Tower
Visual Flight Rules—Rules that govern the procedures for conducting flight under visual
conditions. The term ―VFR‖ is also used in the United States to indicate weather conditions that
are equal to or greater than minimum VFR requirements. In addition, it is used by pilots and
controllers to indicate type of flight plan.
Visual Meteorological Conditions—Meteorological conditions expressed in terms of visibility,
distance from cloud, and ceiling equal to or better than specified minima.
