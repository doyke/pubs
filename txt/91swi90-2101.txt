1. Overview. A Self-Inspection Program (SIP) provides an effective means of assessing mission perfor-
mance and organizational effectiveness through internal review. A thorough SIP gauges a unit’s strengths
and illuminates problem areas. Commanders are SIP customers and therefore dictate the quality of their
SIP. They use SIP results to assess mission readiness and direct resources and energies to correct deficien-
cies. A viable SIP requires a conscientious approach at all levels.
   1.1. Program Criteria. A self-inspection program is beneficial if it does the following:
       1.1.1. Assigns SIP responsibilities and tracks.
       1.1.2. Ensures each functional area, work center, additional duty, and common areas such as small
       computer management, information management, Fraud, Waste, and Abuse (FW&A), supply dis-
       cipline, security and safety are periodically inspected IAW HAF and AFSPC guidance.
       1.1.3. Establishes a method to identify, document, track and resolve deficiencies.
       1.1.4. Provides feedback to commanders at all levels.
2                                                                   91SWI90-2101 10 MARCH 2008


       1.1.5. Assures units are using current and appropriately tailored Air Force Space Command
       checklists (AFSPCCL) and locally developed checklists are tailored and current.
       1.1.6. All units must check on a routine basis that their AFSPCCLs are current with regulatory
       guidance. If changes are required, provide feedback to AFSPC functional.
       1.1.7. Documents all discrepancies in the AFSPC SIP/Findings Automated Tracking System
       (FATS) data base using Form 101s, Discrepancy Repot and IAW AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP1,
       Inspector General Activities, deemed as a problem area.

     Tailor checklists by adding, deleting or modifying items as required. Delete items by drawing a
     diagonal line through all lines of text not applicable. Review tailored checklists semiannually to
     ensure applicability and currency.
        2.7.2.1. Tailored, modified, or revised checklists will be forwarded for review by the appropri-
        ate squadron, group, or special staff agency monitor.
        2.7.2.2. Monitors may develop a local checklist using the guidance found in governing regu-
        lations if checklists do not exist for an individual functional area, or if units want to supple-
        ment what is available. Locally devised checklists should be shared throughout the wing to
        encourage standardization and cooperation, and to avoid duplication. Ensure local checklists
        are current and display the OPR and date of last revision.
        2.7.2.3. Applicable AFSPCCLs and locally developed checklist, if used, will be maintained
        with appropriate answers/responses for each checklist item. Each answer/response will

     Form 101 in the AFSPC/IG SIP/FATS database for any deficiency that cannot be corrected on the
     spot. Forward the inspection completion date, a list of checklists used to complete the inspection,
     opened and closed discrepancies. Provide a report and an electronic copy of the report to the
     squadron SIP monitor.
     2.7.4. Initiate a Form 101 in the AFSPC/IG SIP/FATS database if a discrepancy is found during
     any exercise (as indicated by a problem write-up in an exercise After Action Report).
     2.7.5. Update all open Form 101s monthly until the discrepancy is closed and forward updates to
     the squadron/special staff monitors. Review the AFSPC/IG SIP/FATS database and provide
     updates monthly to all Form 101s. All open Form 101s will be initialed to document this monthly
     review. Provide updates to the squadron monitor so they can be incorporated into the squadron
     report.
     2.7.6. Maintain AFSPCCLs for assigned areas (unless directed otherwise by the squadron SIP
     Monitor). Tailor these checklists to meet the needs of the functional area or work center.
     2.7.7. Forward all closed Form 101s to the squadron SIP monitor for disposition.
6                                                                      91SWI90-2101 10 MARCH 2008


       2.7.8. Executes the functional area responsibilities under the SIP. Maintain SIB in a three ring
       binder (See Paragraph 3. for set-up information and criteria.).
       2.7.9. Supply an applicable AFSPCCL list to squadron monitor.

3. Self-Inspection Binder (SIB):
    3.1. Each unit will maintain a self-inspection binder for their particular area of responsibility. Squad-
    ron monitors may incorporate the responsibilities of the functional area monitors in their SIB. How-
    ever, if the squadron monitor doesn’t incorporate the functional area, the functional area monitors
    must maintain a SIB.
    3.2. SIB will include, as a minimum:
       3.2.1. A table of contents.
       3.2.2. Current appointment letters for their area of responsibility. 91 SW special staff will main-
       tain the 91 SW appointment memorandum. Group monitors will maintain their group and all
       squadron appointment memorandums. Squadron monitors will maintain their squadron and all
       functional area appointment memorandums. Functional area monitors will maintain their appoint-
       ment memorandums as applicable.
       3.2.3. A current index of AFSPCCLs and locally devised checklists. Units may go to the 91 SW/
       XP CoP site to access the current link for the AFSPC index. Special staff, group and squadron
       monitors will maintain a current and complete AFSPCCL index.
       3.2.4. Current special staff/group/squadron/functional area AFSPCCLs and local checklists as
       applicable.
       3.2.5. Group monitors do not have to maintain the squadron/functional area's checklists. Squad-
       ron monitors do not have to maintain their functional area checklists provided the functional areas
       maintain a SIB. If not, the squadron monitors will maintain the functional area's checklists.
       3.2.6. Special Interest Items (SII) quarterly index (links are located on 91 SW/XP CoP site).
       3.2.7. All applicable AF and AFSPC SII checklists (links are located on 91 SW/XP CoP site).
       3.2.8. Last two semiannual self-inspection reports.
       3.2.9. A copy of AFI90-201_AFSPCSUP_I, Attachment 12, and 91 SWI 90-2101.
       3.2.10. Open Form 101s. Functional area monitors that maintain a SIB will also maintain the
       applicable functional area Form 101s. Squadron monitors will maintain the open squadron Form
       101s in their SIB.
       3.2.11. Closed Form 101s. Functional area monitors that maintain a SIB will forward a copy of
       closed discrepancies to their squadron monitor. Squadron monitors will forward a copy of closed
       discrepancies to the group monitors. Maintain the forms in the squadron SIB until the next like
       inspection.
       3.2.12. Other administrative information the monitor requires.
       3.2.13. A current SIP review log. (See Attachment 4.)

4. Internal Self-Inspections:
91SWI90-2101 10 MARCH 2008                                                                                7


  4.1. All binders are susceptible to inspection at any time by 91 SW/CC/CV/XP personnel. Most
  reviews are scheduled but some may be no-notice. The group/squadron/functional area monitors
  should notify their commander of the review as soon as practical. (See Attachment 2.)
     4.1.1. All self-inspection monitors are responsible to supervise and review subordinate SIBs.
     These reviews will be conducted, as a minimum, quarterly and/or whenever a new person is
     assigned self-inspection monitor duties. Each review will be annotated on the review log. Discrep-
     ancies will be corrected by the owner as soon as possible.
     4.1.2. Document reviews on the SIP review log. Hand prepared forms are not acceptable although
     entries may be handwritten. (See Attachment 4.)
  4.2. Checklists:
     4.2.1. Units will use current, applicable AFSPCCLs. It is the responsibility of the group/squadron/
     functional area monitors to order, receive, post and use the index and all applicable checklists. It is
     the commander’s responsibility to determine which publications are “applicable” to a particular
     functional area.
     4.2.2. Monitors may develop a local checklist using the guidance found in governing regulations
     if checklists do not exist for an individual functional area or if units want to supplement what is
     available. Locally devised checklists should be shared throughout the wing to encourage standard-
     ization and cooperation and to avoid duplication. Ensure local checklists are current and display
     the OPR and date of last revision. Use other AFSPCCLs as an example on how to develop your
     own checklist.
     4.2.3. Tailor AFSPCCLs to meet your functional area’s requirements.
         4.2.3.1. Divide checklist questions into two categories, critical and non-critical. These catego-
         ries allow command functional managers to prioritize or emphasize command requirements.
             4.2.3.1.1. Critical; Tasks which if not adequately accomplished, would result in degrada-
             tion of a functional area's or unit's mission performance.
             4.2.3.1.2. Non-critical; Important tasks which address requirements necessary for the effi-
             cient operation of a functional area, work center, or additional duty.
         4.2.3.2. Functional Area Managers may choose to subdivide a checklist into sub-functional
         parts with critical or non-critical questions for each sub-function. The amount of material and
         nature of the functional area will dictate a checklist’s organization.
         4.2.3.3. List each checklist item as a single question, capable of being answered by either a
         "yes" or "no," followed by a reference in parentheses.
         4.2.3.4. Do not duplicate checklist items.
  4.3. Applicable SII checklists must also be used. These checklists focus on command and local
  interest items and are distributed by Air Force and AFSPC. Unit commanders should decide which
  items apply to their organization. Keep all SII applicable checklists until deleted from the quarterly
  index. Unit monitors may go to the 91 SW/XP CoP site to obtain new SII checklists from the Air
  Force and the AFSPC web pages.
  4.4. Documentation of discrepancies:
8                                                                    91SWI90-2101 10 MARCH 2008


       4.4.1. Agencies will use the AFSPC/IG SIP/FATS database to report, track, validate and trend dis-
       crepancies.
       4.4.2. Each functional area should complete a Form 101 for each unrelated write-up or crossfeed
       item requiring action. Indicate the source or paragraph reference for each discrepancy (if applica-
       ble). Refer to the HQ/AFSPC/IG Discrepancies Monitor Guide for detailed instructions on creat-
       ing a Form 101.
       4.4.3. As a minimum, update all open Form 101s monthly. Record the progress made for all dis-
       crepancies logged in the AFSPC/IG SIP/FATS database. The person making the update will place
       his/her initials and the date of the review in the space provided.
       4.4.4. Remove closed Form 101s from the self-inspection binder after the next like inspection that
       prompted the creation of the Form 101. Reference closed discrepancies in the semiannual
       self-inspection report.
       4.4.5. Squadron monitors will forward a monthly update to the appropriate group monitor. Group
       monitors are not required to annotate monthly updates on subordinate units Form 101s.

5. Crossfeed Reports:
    5.1. When possible, 91 SW/XP will place a copy of all inspection reports received from other AFSPC
    units on the 91 SW/XP CoP site for review by commanders. Paper copies will be distributed upon
