voluntary safety representatives (VSRs).
1. General Information. Effective immediately each group within OO-ALC will utilize USRs.
The primary and alternate USR positions will be voluntary, and as such will be called VSRs.
2. VSR Responsibilities:
2.1. Advise their leadership on safety related matters at least on a quarterly basis, or more
frequently as necessary, and document key elements briefed.
