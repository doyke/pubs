SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change implements new guidelines that clarify AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations
and Standards and reflect repeal of the Don’t Ask Don’t Tell policy. It makes Flying and Special
Operations applicable to civilian personnel employed by the Air Force to fill flying or special
operational duty positions. It lists qualification criteria civilian AF physicians must have in order
to make Aeromedical dispositions. Air National Guard (ANG) or Air Force Reserve Command
(AFRC) Flight Surgeons may utilize their Flight Medicine credentials to make aeromedical
dispositions while employed in a civilian Flight Medicine physician role. Aircrew and special
duty personnel not collocated with an active duty base may be returned to flying status to
perform alert, combat or National Air Defense duties when their unit flight surgeon is not
available. These personnel may be returned to flying/Special Operations Duty status after being
examined by a military or civilian physician via ―reach-back‖ consultation with a military Flight
Surgeon as designated by AFMSA/SGPF. Cone Contrast Test (CCT) equipment will be sent to
AF MTFs and ANG and AFRC units not co-located with an MTF no later than January 2011.
Beginning 1 January 2011, or upon receipt of CCT equipment, all flying/special operational duty
personnel or other career fields requiring color vision testing will be tested using both the CCT
and PIP I/PIP II. Passing score on the CCT is defined as 75 or greater on each of the three
colors, red, green and blue. For additional implementation instructions and disposition of
Airmen       with       failing      scores,      refer       to       the    AFMS       KX        at:

B_122236. AFSPC is the lead MAJCOM for the Cyberspace mission and has designated the
AFSCs 1B4 and 17DXA, as well as several 17DXB crew positions require Combat Mission
Ready status. These AFSCs and positions must now meet Space and Missile Operations Duty
medical standards and have their duty and qualification status managed by AF Form 1042. For
implementation         instructions,        refer        to        the     AFMS         KX         at:

Section 1B— Medical Examinations

1.2. Medical Examinations. There are various types of medical examinations: Accession,
Department of Defense Medical Examination Review Board (DODMERB), Initial Flying,
Preventative Health Assessment (PHA), Flying, Retirement, Separation, and DD Form 2697,
Report of Medical Assessment. As long as all requirements are met, a medical examination may
serve more than one purpose. Note: All induction physical examinations accomplished overseas
by a medical treatment facility must be submitted through PEPP to AETC/SGPS. AETC/SGPS
is the certifying authority for all accession physicals not done at a MEPS facility. AFRC/SG is
the reviewing and certification authority for all AFRC enlistment and commissioning exams.
Local Reserve medical units are the certification authority for enlistment exams on individuals
who do not require a waiver.
   1.2.1. A medical examination is required before:
       1.2.1.1. Entrance into active military service, ARC, AFROTC, USAFA, and Officer
       Training School (OTS).
       1.2.1.2. Entry into Flying or other special operational duty training.
12                                                  AFI48-123_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012

         and 1.2.1.2.) will be electronically submitted (i.e., Physical Examination Processing
         Program (PEPP)) unless specifically authorized by certification/waiver authority for
         circumstances in which PEPP and Aeromedical Information Management Waiver
         Tracking System (AIMWTS) are not utilized or available. Note: All induction
         physical examinations accomplished overseas by a medical treatment facility must be
         submitted through PEPP to AETC/SGPS. AETC/SGPS is the certifying authority for
         all accession physicals not done at a MEPS facility. AFRC/SG is the reviewing and
         certification authority for all AFRC enlistment and commissioning exams. Local
         Reserve medical units are the certification authority for enlistment exams on
         individuals who do not require a waiver.
     1.2.1.3. Termination of service when specified by Chapter 8 of this instruction.

  1.2.2. Examiners: A credentialed military flight surgeon (FS) with current/active privileges
  in flight medicine will perform medical examinations on Air Force flying and/or special
  operational duty personnel. When the exam is accomplished by a non-Air Force FS at a
  location where no AF FS is available, forward the documents (including PHA and clinical
  documentation, labs, AF Form 1042, AF Form 469, etc.) to the examinee’s MAJCOM/SG for
  review and certification (including aircrew on joint/NATO tours, etc). When the exam is
  accomplished by a non-AF FS at a joint base, the AF flight FS must ensure sister-Service FS
  are trained in AF standards and associated paperwork. If trained, sister-Service FS can sign
  AF Form 1042 without AF FS review (with quality control accessed via FS peer review). If
  untrained, an AF FS must review all PHA and return to flying status (RTFS) documentation
  for AF aircrew. All aircrew members examined by a U.S. military FS and found qualified to
  perform flight duties will be returned to flying status upon completion of their examination.
     1.2.2.1. Military flight surgeons must be credentialed and privileged at the examining
     facility and can be of any branch of the military service.
     1.2.2.2. ANG/SG may delegate review and certification authority to current, trained and
     designated State Air Surgeon’s on certain initial Flying Class (FC) III and return to FCIII,
     Commission/Enlistment physicals not requiring MAJCOM level waiver and on Active
     Guard Reserve (AGR) Title 32 physicals. Note: Consult current Tri-Service agreements
     and MAJCOM/SGPA prior to forwarding examinations.
     1.2.2.3. A credentialed physician employed by the armed services (regardless of active
     duty status, to include TRICARE providers), as well as designated Air Force physician
     assistants, (Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) 42G4X) or primary care nurse practitioners
     (AFSC 46NXC), under the supervision of, and subject to review by a physician,
     accomplish all other non-flying medical examinations.
         1.2.2.3.1. Physicians who are Air Force civilian employees may perform medical
         examinations on Air Force flying and/or special operational duty personnel and be
         credentialed to make aeromedical dispositions ONLY if they meet the qualification
         criteria listed in the Civilian Flight Medicine Physician Performance Work Statement
         located at https://kx.afms.mil/commoditycouncil.

Section 1C— Physical Profile System

1.3. Physical Profile System. This chapter, 1.7, Attachment 3, and AFI 10-203 establishes
procedures for the documentation and administrative management of Profiles. The physical
profile system classifies individuals according to physical functional abilities. It applies to all
active duty and ARC military personnel, Retired Regular AF Airmen of the PIM, as well as
applicants for appointment, enlistment, and induction into military service. The goal is an
accurate assessment of an individual’s medical status.
   1.3.1. Purpose of AF Form 422, Physical Profile Serial Report, is to standardize
   classification of an individual’s physical functional abilities.
1.4. Establishing the Initial Physical Profile. The initial profile is established during the entry
physical examination based on the results of that exam. The initial Form 422, verifies the initial
profile serial of all individuals entering active duty and serves as the baseline Profile Serial
AFI48-123_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012                                                               15


Report. Reasons for creating an AF Form 422 include, but are not limited to overseas PCS,
retraining/special duty (SUAS-O duty, military training instructor duty or other special duty
clearance), PME or training attendance, and medical disqualification from an AFSC, etc.
1.5. Responsibilities:

   1.5.2. Profile Officers.
       1.5.2.1. Profile officers are appointed by letter by the MTF Commander.
          1.5.2.1.1. The Profile officer serves a critical review step in profiling and duty
          limitations. Thus, it is imperative that a limited number of profile officers be
          assigned at each MTF.
          1.5.2.1.2. Profile officers will normally be flight surgeons credentialed and working
          in flight medicine. MAJCOM/SGP may authorize deviations when no flight
          medicine clinic exists or no flight surgeons are available for appointment by the MTF
          commander.

       well as Chapter 1, Section 1C, Chapter 5, Section 5A, Chapter 6, G, H, I, J, K, G,
       Chapter 13, Attachment 3, and AFI 10-203.
       1.5.2.3. Profile Officers will ensure mission and patient interests are considered to
       maximize the benefit to both.
   1.5.3. Final validation and signature. The Profile Officer performs final validation and
   signs all AF Forms 422 recommending any of the following:
       1.5.3.1. Medical Disqualification from an AFSC.
       1.5.3.2. Retraining.
       1.5.3.3. All AF Form 422s reviewed for direct entry from active duty into any AF
       Commission Programs (i.e. Officer Training School (OTS), AF ROTC or Airman
       Education Commissioning Program).

  1.5.4. Public Health. Note: Anytime Public Health or Force Health Management is
  referenced for Regular Air Force in this instruction, these functions will be performed by,
  Flight Medicine for AFRC; Health Technician for the ANG.
     1.5.4.1. Public Health is the initial point of contact for all Profiling actions.
     1.5.4.2. Public Health is responsible for the administrative tasks related to the profiling
     system in accordance with this instruction.
     1.5.4.3. Public Health will serve as the communications link between squadron/unit
     commanders, supervisors, and the health care providers (to include the MTF/SGP (see
     below)).
     1.5.4.4. Public Health will review and sign all profile actions.
     1.5.4.5. Retraining applications will be reviewed by Public Health to ensure members are
     qualified for entry into the AFSC(s) for which the member is applying. Review of each
     AFSC’s physical requirements are found in Officer and Enlisted Classification
     Directories. The AF Form 422 will indicate each of the selected AFSCs the member is
     and is not qualified to enter. When flying or special operational duty AFSCs are selected,
     Chapter 6, G, H, I, J, K, G will be reviewed for disqualifying defects. If defects are
     found the member will be informed and a determination of potential waiver action will be
     determined by a flight surgeon.
         1.5.4.5.1. When a medical defect permanently precludes continued duty in a
         member’s AFSC, but the member meets retention and deployment standards, a
         medical recommendation for retraining will be sent by Force Health Management to
         the MPF on an AF Form 422, with PULHES updated, and an AF Form 469
         describing duty limitations. MEB is not required if member meets retention/deployed
         standards. See AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted)
         and AFI 10-203, Duty Limiting Conditions for further information.

          1.6.3.4.1. General Information:
          1.6.3.4.2. Officer and Enlisted Directories establishes a SAT standard for each
          AFSC.
          1.6.3.4.3. When AFPC requests a SAT evaluation in writing, Public Health reviews
          the accession MEPS physical and current medical records and completes the
          appropriate endorsement.
          1.6.3.4.4. If the profile "X" factor equals or exceeds the SAT standard for the
          retraining AFSC, do not retest unless a medical condition is discovered changing the

           SAT. If a medical condition is discovered, refer the individual to a health care
           provider for evaluation prior to SAT testing. See Officer and Enlisted Classification
           Directories for detailed requirements.
           1.6.3.4.5. If the profile "X" factor is blank, contains a numeric character 1, 2, or 3, or
           is an alpha character less than the SAT standard, the SAT results are unsatisfactory.
           1.6.3.4.6. A provider’s review of medical records must indicate no potential medical
           reason that member cannot perform safe successful lifting attempt.

   1.7.1. AF Form 469. AF Form 469 is a formal means to notify commanders and medical
   personnel of the impact of a condition on ability to perform military service. When
   determining a psychiatric profile, consider the airman’s current duties and all foreseeable
   duties. It is the provider’s responsibility, with the assistance of the commander, to become
   reasonably familiar with the duty demands of the airman being evaluated.
   1.7.2. Duty Limiting Conditions. Duty limiting conditions are based on an operational risk
   management model. These decisions must be coupled to BOTH ―mishap probability‖
   (chance that medication or illness related duty impairment will occur) and the ―hazard
   severity‖ (the danger to mission, security or safety should the impairment impact the person’s
   function at a critical time).
   1.7.3. Disorders of substance abuse or dependence. Disorders of substance abuse or
   dependence receive duty restrictions IAW AFI 44-121, Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention
   and Treatment (ADAPT) Program.
   1.7.4. Disorders That Are Unsuiting. Disorders that are unsuiting for military service are
   managed administratively through the patient’s chain of command and must not be confused
   with medical issues (See Chapter 5).

1.8. Medical History. If the patient’s health record contains a completed SF 93, Report of
Medical History or DD Form 2807-1, Report of Medical History, and the individual
acknowledges that the information is current and correct, do not accomplish a new form.
   1.8.1. Changes to existing SF 93 or DD 2807-1. Make an addendum to the most current
   and complete Report of Medical History by adding any significant items of interval history
   since the last Report of Medical History was accomplished.
      1.8.1.1. Additional Space. Use SF 507, Clinical Record-Continuation Sheet as an
      attachment to the Report of Medical History when additional space is required (See
      Physical Examinations Techniques).
   1.8.2. Report of Medical History. SF 93 (or DD Form 2807-1) is to be updated and
   attached to PEPP SF 88, Medical Record-Report of Medical Examination, DD Form 2808,
   Report of Medical Examination, or the PHA, where required, when medical examinations are
   accomplished for the following purposes:
      1.8.2.1. Entry into active military service.
      1.8.2.2. Appointment or enlistment in the Air Force or Reserve Forces.
      1.8.2.3. Retirement or separation from active military service as specified by this
      instruction.
      1.8.2.4. Periodic flying and non-flying assessments as specified in Chapter 6 or AFI 44-
      170.
      1.8.2.5. Whenever an examination is sent for higher authority review.
      1.8.2.6. Whenever considered necessary by the examining health care provider; for
      example, after a significant illness or injury or commander directed physical assessment.
      1.8.2.7. Examination of an ARC member. For ANG flying and non-flying PHAs,
      accomplish a PIMR generated SF 507 or AF WEB HA in place of updated SF 93/DD
      Form 2807-1.
      1.8.2.8. Lost medical records. Accomplish a PHA with Report of Medical History.
      Note: Accomplish the Medical History electronically in PEPP when original history was
      done electronically.
   1.8.3. Interval Medical History. Once a complete medical history has been recorded on a
   SF 93 or DD Form 2807-1, only significant items of medical history since the last medical
   examination are recorded. This is called the interval medical history.
      1.8.3.1. Changes in Flight Status. Any significant medical condition requiring
      hospitalization, excusal, grounding, profile change or suspension from flying status is
      recorded as part of the interval medical history. The information concerning the interval
      medical history is obtained by questioning the examinee and by a thorough review of the
      examinee’s health records.
      1.8.3.2. Updates. The interval medical history is recorded on SF 93, item 25 or
      continued on SF 507 and on DD 2807-1, item 30. Reference each update to the medical
      history with the current date, followed by any significant items of medical history since
      last examination. The most recent SF 93 or DD Form 2807-1 and all subsequent SF 507
AFI48-123_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012                                                                   21


       must be filed together chronologically as all of these forms comprise the medical history.
       ANG will use PIMR generated SF 507 and AF WEB HA for interval history.
       1.8.3.3. Significant Medical History. Use SF 93/DD Form 2807-1, waiver requests,
       MEB diagnosis, or restricted duty for 30 days or more as a guide in determining items to
       include as significant medical history. Do not record "routine" items such as URIs, viral
       illnesses, etc., unless hospitalization was required or the illness is of a frequent or chronic
       nature.
       1.8.3.4. Denial Statement. After recording the interval medical history, the following
       denial statement is recorded: "No other significant medical or surgical history to report
       since last examination (enter the date of that examination in parentheses)."
       1.8.3.5. No Interval Medical History Statement. If the examinee had no interval medical
       history, record the current date followed by the statement: "Examinee denies and review
       of outpatient medical record fails to reveal any significant interval medical or surgical
       history to report since last examination dated (enter the date of that examination in
       parentheses)." See physical examination techniques for denial statement used when
       accomplishing the initial SF 93 or DD Form 2807-1.
1.9. Medical Examinations. The results of medical examinations are recorded on SF 88/DD
Form 2808 or approved substitutes in accordance with physical examination techniques.
1.10. DD Form 2697. DoD directs that DD Form 2697 be accomplished for all members
separating or retiring from active duty, consult Chapter 8.
1.11. Adaptability Rating Military Aviation (ARMA) and other military duties , such as for
Adaptability Rating for Control Duty (AR-GBC) or AR-SMOD etc., is the responsibility of the
examining flight surgeon, as is the scope and extent of the interview. Initial (entry into training)
unsatisfactory adaptability ratings are usually rendered for poor motivation for flying (or other
duty), or evidence of a potential safety of flight risk, etc. (see 6.44.24 and physical examination
techniques for further information).
1.12. DD Form 2766, Adult Preventive and Chronic Care Flowsheet. DD Form 2766 is used
to record results of tests such as blood type, G6PD, DNA, GO, NO-GO pills, etc., and also used
as a deployment document IAW AFI 10-403, Deployment, Planning and Execution, paragraph
1.5.18.2. which requires the medical group commander to provide a current DD Form 2766 for
all deploying personnel. Note: The similar AF Form 1480A, Adult Preventive and Chronic Care
Flowsheet, may still be used.

  Training Command (AETC) AETC/SGPS certifies examination on 1 Jan 2008. The 48
  month period expires 1 Jan 2012.). Medical history (SF 93/DD Form 2807-1) must be
  verified as current within 12 months prior to start of training. Must have current PHA in
  addition to certified IFC1/1A. Note: An initial certification examination does not exempt
  Active duty applicants from accomplishing their required PHA while awaiting training.
     3.1.3.1. Undergraduate Flying Training (UFT) applicants must meet Flying Class I
     standards to be eligible for entry into the Medical Flight Screening (MFS) program.
     Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) pilot applicants must meet IFC IIU standards to be
     eligible for Medical Flight Screening-Neuropsychiatric (MFS-N) screening. Currently
     rated RPA applicants who previously completed MFS in conjunction with IFC I/IA and
     are in active flying assignments must meet IFC IIU standards, but do not require repeat
     MFS-N screening.
     3.1.3.2. All initial applications for UFT and RPA pilot duty must pass MFS and MFS-N
     prior to beginning undergraduate pilot training or initial RPA pilot training. MFS for
     RPA pilot applicants will be limited to conditions requiring further evaluation (MFS-N is
     mandatory and may include enhanced MFS-N screening if appropriate).
     3.1.3.3. Pilot and Navigator candidates must have a current, certified Flying Class I/1A
     examination, respectively, on record. Note: While attending pilot and navigator training
     FCI/IA/ standards (as appropriate) apply. Upon graduation FCII standards apply.
     3.1.3.4. The member’s PHA should be current prior to beginning active Undergraduate
     Flying Training (UFT). See 3.1.8.1. If a member was not on Active Duty (e.g.
     AFROTC/OTS candidates) prior to arrival at UFT or is otherwise not PHA current, then
     member will have PHA accomplished during their in processing at the UFT base. PHA
     currency must be maintained throughout UFT.
  3.1.4. Banked Status. UFT graduates waiting upgrade training and Aviation Service Code
  (ASC) 5J flyers are inactive, but are required to meet Flying Class II standards through
  annual PHAs with the flight surgeon.
  3.1.5. Inactive Flyers. Inactive flyers that do not receive flying pay and hold an ASC of 6J,
  6L, 7J, 8J, and 9J, (see 6.13) are not required to maintain Flying Class II standards as
  outlined in Chapter 6.
  3.1.6. Individuals selected to attend UFT and currently assigned to a non-rated position
  pending UFT report date. If the start of UFT will be more than 48 months from the date of
  the certification of the original flying class I or IA physical examination, a new flying class I

  or 1A exam will be required with certification by AETC/SG or his/her designee. The
  requirements outlined in paragraph 3.1.2. and its sub-paragraphs apply.
  3.1.7. Return-to-Active Duty Programs:
     3.1.7.1. Rated Recall Applicants: Participants in a Voluntary Rated Recall Program
     must meet IFCII/IIU/III standards and retention standards as appropriate to crew
     positions. Document the appropriate flying class physical in PEPP, and if a waiver is
     required, submit through AIMWTS. AETC/SG is the enlistment/commissioning
     accession authority. See Attachment 2, Table A2.1 for certification/waiver authority.
     Note: IFC physical is not required if the applicant separated from active duty within 6
     calendar months. Their last PHA must be valid through the date of re-entry or a new
     IFCII/IIU/III physical will be required.
     3.1.7.2. All other return-to-active duty applicants: All Airmen returning to active duty
     following ARC duty or break in service, or applying for initial active duty following
     ARC tours, must have an initial enlistment/commissioning/aviation (if appropriate)
     physical examination documented in PEPP if they have been off active duty for more
     than 6 months. If they have been off active duty for less than six months, a current/valid
     PHA will be used. If aviation waiver is required, submit through AIMWTS. AETC/SG
     is the enlistment/commissioning accession authority. Note: See Attachment 2, Table
     A2.1
  3.1.8. All other initial examinations. All other initial examinations, including Flying Class
  III, Flying Class II (Flight Surgeon Duties), FCIIU (RPA pilot), ground based controller
  (GBC), RPA Sensor Operator (1U0X1), and Space and Missile Operations Duty (SMOD) are
  valid for 24 months from date of certification/waiver. If the certified physical examination
  will expire during formal technical training, the examination may be extended by the local
  SGP until completion of formal training.
     3.1.8.1. Regardless of initial physical certification date, a PHA must be completed within
     three months of arriving at their first permanent duty station IAW AFI 44-170.
  3.1.9. General Officers, Aircrew, Special Operational Duty, and ARC Personnel .
  Medical examinations are valid for one year or as specified in AFI 44-170.
  3.1.10. Active Duty (AD) personnel PHAs are valid for one year or as specified in AFI
  44-170. AF/SG or delegate as dictated by mission requirements may extend this expiration
  (See AFI 44-170).
  3.1.11. Physiological Training (9W)/Operational Support (ASC 9C) clearance
  examinations. These examinations are valid until the end of the birth month of the next year
  from the date accomplished.
  3.1.12. PHA with associated paperwork less than 12 months. Note: ARC members
  ordered to EAD with the regular AF do not need a physical examination since they need only
  meet Chapter 5 standards. Most recent preventive health assessment can be used for
  determining suitability to be mobilized.
  3.1.13. Interservice transfers. Interservice transfers of officers to the United States Air
  Force and the United States Air Force Reserve must be IAW AFI 36-2004, Interservice

                   APPOINTMENT, ENLISTMENT, AND INDUCTION

Section 4A—Medical Standards for Appointment, Enlistment, and Induction.

4.1. References. DoDI 6130.4. establishes basic medical standards for enlistment, appointment,
and induction into the Armed Forces of the United States according to the authority contained in
Title 10, United States Code, Section 113. DoDI 6130.4 implements DoD Directive 6130.3,
DoDI 6130.4 sets forth the medical conditions and physical defects that are causes for rejection
for military service. These standards are not all inclusive and other diseases or defects can be
cause for rejection based upon the medical judgment of the examining healthcare provider.
   4.1.1. Personnel rejected for military service for any medical condition or physical defect
   listed in DoDI 6130.4 may be reviewed if the condition has resolved and a history of the
   condition is not disqualifying IAW this AFI.
   4.1.2. DoD Directive 6130.3. directs utilization of the International Classification of Disease
   (ICD) in all records pertaining to a medical condition that results in a personnel action, such
   as separation or medical waiver. In addition, when a medical condition standard is waived or
   results in a separation, written clarification of the personnel action must be provided using
   standard medical terminology.
   4.1.3. In accordance with AFI 10-248, Fitness Program weight and body fat determinations
   remain part of accession physical standards. Weight and body fat standards are in AFI 10-
   248. See Chapter 6, paragraph 6.44.29 for additional requirements for flying applicants.
4.2. Applicability. These standards apply to:
   4.2.1. Applicants for appointment as commissioned officers in the Active and Reserve
   components who have not held a prior commission for at least 6 months, or it has been more
   than 6 months since separation.
   4.2.2. Applicants for enlistment in the regular Air Force. Medical conditions or physical
   defects predating original enlistment, for the first six months of active duty in the regular Air
   Force.
   4.2.3. Applicants for enlistment in the Reserve or Air National Guard. For medical
   conditions or physical defects predating original enlistment (existing prior to service
   (EPTS)), these standards apply during the enlistee’s initial period of active duty for training
   until their return to their Reserve Component Units.
   4.2.4. Applicants for reenlistment in Regular Air Force and ARC after a period of more than
   6 months have elapsed since separation.
   4.2.5. Applicants for the Scholarship or Advanced Course ROTC, and all other Armed
   Forces special officer personnel procurement programs.
   4.2.6. Retention of cadets at the United States Air Force Academy and students enrolled in
   the ROTC scholarship programs, who have not completed 2 years with no break of their
   respective program.
   4.2.7. AFROTC graduates whose active duty is delayed under applicable directives.
AFI48-123_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012                                                           31


  4.2.8. All individuals being inducted into the Armed Forces.
  4.2.9. Individuals on Temporary Disability Retirement List (TDRL) who have been found fit
  upon reevaluation and wish to return to active duty. The prior disabling defect or defects,
  and any other physical defects identified before placement on the TDRL that would not have
  prevented reenlistment, are exempt from this directive. Note: Individuals on TDRL are
  considered ―retired‖ and thus have left active duty, (most likely for a period of at least 6
  months before their first re-examination as a TDRL designated member, and therefore, fall
  under accession standards prior to re-entering military service.

            CONTINUED MILITARY SERVICE (RETENTION STANDARDS)

Section 5A— Medical Evaluation

5.1. Medical Evaluation for Continued Military Service (Retention Standards). Section 5B
establishes medical conditions and defects that are potentially disqualifying and/or preclude
continued military service. While this is not an all-inclusive list, Airmen with conditions listed
in this chapter require evaluation for continued military service (See paragraph 5.3). Other
physical and mental conditions (see 5.3.21) that render an individual unsuited for duty or
otherwise interfere with military service do not constitute a physical disability. The conditions in
5.3.21 are not eligible for MEB processing. Airmen with these conditions must be referred to
their commander for possible administrative action if the disorder interferes with the individual’s
ability to deploy or perform duties consistent with their rank, AFSC, or duty position. These
conditions are described in greater detail in paragraph 5.3.21 of this AFI, as well as AFI 36-3208,
Administrative Separation of Airmen, para 5.11 and AFI 36-3212, Physical Evaluation for
Retention, Retirement, and Separation.
   5.1.1. For Active Duty. Review of potentially disqualifying medical conditions and defects
   via the DAWG IAW AFI 10-203. Processing is via MEB or ALC-fast track.
   5.1.2. For ARC. Potentially disqualifying defects must first be determined if the condition
   is in the Line of Duty IAW AFI 36-2910, Chapter 3. If found to be In Line of Duty,
   processing occurs through the Active Duty process in paragraph 5.1.1 of this instruction. If
   potentially disqualifying defects are not In Line of Duty, worldwide duty processing occurs
   IAW AFI 10-203, Chapter 5.
5.2. Applicability. The retention standards apply to:
   5.2.1. Regular Air Force members on active duty, unless excluded from disability
   evaluation by applicable directives (e.g. Punitive actions).
   5.2.2. All individuals who have separated or retired from active duty with any of the
   regular Armed Services, but who are reenlisting in the regular Air Force or ARC when
   no more than 6 months have elapsed between separation and reenlistment.
   5.2.3. ARC and retired regular members if mobilized or otherwise recalled to active
   duty.
   5.2.4. ARC members who are:
       5.2.4.1. On EAD unless excluded from disability evaluation by applicable directives.
       5.2.4.2. Ordered to EAD with the regular Air Force and who are eligible for fitness for
       duty evaluation under applicable directives.
       5.2.4.3. Reenlisting in the regular Air Force when no more than 6 months have elapsed
       between release from EAD with any regular Armed Service and reenlistment or entry. If
       more than 6 months have elapsed, Chapter 4 applies.
       5.2.4.4. Not on EAD but eligible for MEB under applicable directives.
AFI48-123_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012                                                               33


       5.2.4.5. AFRC members entering AGR tours. ANG members entering EAD statutory
       tours (Title 10) or AGR tours (Title 32).
   5.2.5. United States Air Force Academy (USAFA), AFROTC (after 2 contract years)
   cadets and Health Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP) when the student begins
   their third academic (USAFA Second Class) year.
   5.2.6. Air Reserve Components. The appropriate ARC surgeon (see Attachment 2, note
   8) uses the standards in Section 5B and list of allowable prescribed medications to
   determine:
       5.2.6.1. The medical qualification for continued military duty in the ARC for members
       not on EAD and not eligible for disability processing.
       5.2.6.2. The medical qualification of officers and enlisted members from any service
       component requesting entrance into USAFR and ANG.
           5.2.6.2.1. The medical qualification of officers and enlisted members from any
           service component requesting entrance into the ANG provided no more than 6
           months have elapsed between separation from the service component and entry into
           the ANG.
           5.2.6.2.2. If more than 6 months (from date of separation) have elapsed, applicants
           must meet the standards of DoDI 6130.4.

Section 5B—Medical Standards for Continued Military Service (Retention Standards)

5.3. Standards. While this is not an all-inclusive list of unfitting/disqualifying conditions,
Airmen with conditions listed in this section require evaluation for continued military service.
These standards and other diseases or defects not specifically listed can be cause for rejection
based upon the medical judgment of the examining physician or reviewing authority. The
retention standard also requires the member to be fit for mobility status IAW Chapter 13. Also
read paragraph 5.3.20 of this chapter when considering fitness for continued military duty. For
active duty Airmen and ARC Airmen with duty-related (line-of-duty-yes conditions), refer
members with disqualifying conditions to the DAWG. This also applies to AFROTC, and
Cadets who may fall under retention standards based on 4.2.6., but not yet graduated. For
Medical Evaluation Board (MEB) processing, see AFI 41-210. For ARC members with non-
duty-related (line-of-duty-no) conditions, see Chapter 11. For Rated Recall Applicants and other
Airmen returning to active duty who do not meet retention standards but are eligible for an
assignment limitation code, AETC/SG will coordinate with AFPC/DPAMM through the ALC
Fast Track pathway for potential assignment restrictions. While elective surgery by itself is not
necessarily disqualifying , intentional effects and unintended complications from elective surgery
may render an individual unfit for worldwide duty. For elective surgery information, refer to
AFI 44-102.
   5.3.1. Head.
       5.3.1.1. The loss of substance of the skull with or without prosthetic replacement
       accompanied by residual signs or symptoms that preclude satisfactory performance of
       duty or unrestricted station assignability.
       5.3.1.2. An unprotected skull defect 3 centimeter (cm) in diameter or larger.

         5.3.11.7.1. Seizures following omission of prescribed medication or ingestion of
         alcoholic beverages are not indicative of the controllability of the disorder.

     5.3.11.14. Peripheral nerve conditions such as:
         5.3.11.14.1. Neuralgia, when symptoms are severe, persistent, and do not respond to
         treatment.
         5.3.11.14.2. Neuritis or paralysis due to peripheral nerve injury, when manifested by
         more than moderate, permanent functional impairment.
     5.3.11.15. Syringomyelia.
     5.3.11.16. Other neurological conditions. Any other neurological condition, regardless
     of etiology, when after adequate treatment, there remain residuals, such as persistent
     severe headaches, weakness or paralysis of important muscle groups, deformity,
     incoordination, pain or sensory disturbance, disturbance of consciousness, speech, or
     mental defects, or personality changes of such a degree as to definitely interfere with the
     performance of duty.
  5.3.12. Axis I Diagnosis, and Other Mental Conditions. MEB is indicated in those
  instances when a mental health condition precludes satisfactory performance of duty or
  worldwide assignability or deployment. An MEB must be done when a condition has caused
  or is expected to cause significant duty impairment or limitations for greater than one year
  and for conditions in which there is recurrent impairment or recurrent impairment is
  expected. Certain Axis I conditions make an airman unfit for duty and subject to MEB (refer
  to 5.3.12.2.5). Axis II conditions can make a person unsuitable for further military service
  and subject to administrative separation. Incapacity because of illness (unfit for duty) must
  be distinguished from lack of motivation or underlying personality disorder (unsuitable for
  duty). Axis II conditions, when present with an Axis I condition can clearly worsen overall
  impairment and prognosis. MEB evaluation is required in those instances when an Axis I or
  Axis I combined with Axis II condition precludes satisfactory performance of duty or
  worldwide assignability. If a diagnosis which questions fitness for duty (Axis I) is made
  while a member is pending administrative separation, the member’s commander contacts the
  local MPF and Staff Judge Advocate for specific guidance.
     5.3.12.1. Any psychotic episode other than those with a brief duration, good prognosis
     and clearly identifiable and reversible cause must meet MEB.
     5.3.12.2. Mental conditions requiring MEB:

        5.3.12.2.1. Conditions that are expected to have persistent duty impairment (more
        than 1 year despite treatment).
        5.3.12.2.2. Conditions associated with recurrent duty impairment (2 or more episodes
        of impairment in 12 months).
        5.3.12.2.3. Conditions which require continuing psychiatric support (e.g. weekly
        psychotherapy in order to function) beyond one year.
        5.3.12.2.4. Conditions requiring use of lithium, anticonvulsants, or antipsychotics for
        mood stabilization.
        5.3.12.2.5. Individuals who experience recurrent depression or anxiety disorders,
        require psychiatric medication for greater than one year, who have been hospitalized
        for a psychiatric condition, require an evaluation by a military mental health provider.
        These cases warrant careful consideration of fitness for duty, worldwide assignability
        and deployability, given that adequate mental health support may not be available in
        all locations. Serious psychiatric illnesses (refer to criteria in 5.3.12.2.1-4 above) that
        result in hospitalization require a MEB. For ANG members on long-term
        antidepressant maintenance therapy even if asymptomatic or in remission, a WWD
        evaluation must still be forwarded to ANG/SGPA for consideration.
        5.3.12.2.6. Following any active duty suicide attempt, the MTF SGH will lead a
        meeting to review the case and determine the medical disposition of the individual;
        this meeting must include at least one mental health provider. An active duty Airmen
        with a potentially medically disqualifying diagnosis will meet a medical evaluation
        board. For suicide attempts by ARC members, a fitness for duty determination will
        be instituted (See AFRC/SGP Consolidated Program Memorandum).
        5.3.12.2.7. ARC members with an axis I diagnosis will receive a non-duty related
        fitness for duty evaluation. Reserve providers must look closely at any member on
        psychotropic drugs to determine if any axis I diagnosis exists. For AFRC members
        on psychotropic drugs for non-psychiatric diagnosis do not need a worldwide duty
        evaluation based on this section. For ANG members on SSRI medication for non-
        Axis II diagnosis for up to 90 days do not require a WWD evaluation. For all other
        questionable cases, please forward to ANG/SGPA for determination.
     5.3.12.3. Certain psychiatric disorders render an individual unsuited for duty, rather than
     unfit, and are subject to administrative separation (IAW AFI 36-3208, para 5.11).
        5.3.12.3.1. Substance use disorders may render an individual unsuitable and subject
        to administrative separation. Provisions for treatment and disposition are in
        appropriate directives (IAW AFI 44-121). Substance use alone is not a cause for
        referral to MEB even if there are recurrent duty restrictions/impairments. MEB
        evaluations are indicated only in those instances where substance use is the proximate
        result of a current or pre-existing Axis I condition.
        5.3.12.3.2. Unsatisfactory duty performance due to personality disorders, adjustment
        disorders, factitious disorders, or sexual perversions may render an individual
        unsuitable as opposed to unfit and subject to administrative separation. Unless found
        fit for duty by the disability evaluation system, a separation for personality disorder is
AFI48-123_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012                                                           47


         not authorized if service-related PTSD is also diagnosed IAW DoDI 1332.14,
         Enlisted Administrative Separations. Consult legal for further disposition and
         clarification.
         5.3.12.3.3. Learning Disorders. Individuals determined to have a primary mental
         deficiency or special learning defect which interferes with the satisfactory
         performance of duty are unsuitable and subject to administrative separation. Learning
         disorders that interfere with effective duty performance are dealt with through
         administrative channels.
         5.3.12.3.4. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Individuals diagnosed
         with ADHD must be carefully evaluated for suitability for continued service.
         Members with this condition do not merit a medical board disposition and may be
         managed administratively. If treatment with medication is required for adequate duty
         performance, referral to the unit commander for determination of administrative
         disposition is appropriate. The commander may seek administrative separation based
         on impaired performance or allow for continued duty if the value to the unit
         outweighs risks of requiring medication. If treatment with medication is not required
         for adequate duty performance, the member remains suited for continued military
         service. Note: ANG individuals diagnosed with ADHD must be carefully evaluated
         for suitability for continued service. If treatment with medication is required, a
         Worldwide Duty evaluation and waiver request to ANG/SG is required.
         5.3.12.3.5. "Flying phobia" of sufficient magnitude to preclude military air
         transportation is dealt with administratively unless the condition is the proximate
         result of an Axis I condition other than simple phobia.
  5.3.13. Extremities.
     5.3.13.1. Upper extremities.
         5.3.13.1.1. Amputation of part or parts of an upper extremity that results in
         impairment equivalent to the loss of use of a hand.
         5.3.13.1.2. Joint ranges of motion, which do not equal or exceed the following:

     (b) Fasting plasma glucose greater than or equal to 126 mg/dl, or (c) 2 hour plasma
     glucose greater than or equal to 200 mg/dl during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).
     The diagnosis is considered provisional until confirmed by any of these methods on a
     subsequent day. Values for fasting plasma glucose greater than or equal to 110 but less
     than 126 mg/dl are considered to represent impaired fasting glucose; 2 hours post-
     prandial glucose levels greater than or equal to 140 but less than 200 mg/dl represent

               describes, or documents the disqualifying defects and enters demographics and
               disqualifying diagnosis into PEPP and AIMWTS, include a brief AMS with
               pertinent information, signs, dates and forwards to certification/waiver authority
               as defined in Attachment 2. These exams must not be disqualified at the base but
               must be completed and forwarded to the certification/wavier authority. Note: All
               IFCIII physicals are required to have color vision, depth perception, height,
               hearing, distant and near visual acuity testing results recorded even if a specific
               AFSC does not require the standard to qualify for a particular career field.
               Results must be recorded and information put into PEPP and AIMWTS.
               6.1.3.1.4.2. Forward aeromedical disqualifications to the MAJCOM/SG for
               review and disposition. Local medical facilities do not have disqualification
               certification authority. MAJCOM/SG will notify AFMSA/SG3PF of disqualified
               cases (rated pilots only). AFMSA/SG3PF will notify FAA of medical
               disqualification for rated pilots only.

Section 6B— Waiver Information

6.2. General Waiver Information. For applicants applying for initial and special operational
flying duties who are not currently already in the military, accessions and enlistments standards
in Chapter 4 apply as well as appropriate flying or special operational duty standards that
they are applying for. Chapter 5 applies to personnel already serving as active duty or ARC.
(example, AD SSgt applying for IFCI duty must meet retention standards in Chapter 5 as well
as IFCI standards). The medical conditions listed in Section 5B, Section 6K, Chapter 4,
Chapter 5, and Chapter 13 are cause to reject an examinee for flying training (all classes), or
continued flying duty (classes II or III) unless a waiver is granted. Section 6G applies to rated
pilots Section 6H applies to FCIIU. Acute medical problems, injuries, or their appropriate
therapy are cause for withholding certification for flying training, or temporarily restricting the
individual from flying until the problem is resolved, using AF Form 1042 IAW Section 6C.
These standards are not all inclusive, and other diseases, or defects, can be cause for rejection
based upon the judgment of the examining flight surgeon. Any condition, that in the opinion of
the flight surgeon presents a hazard to flying safety, the individual’s health, or mission
completion, is cause for temporary disqualification for flying duties. Consult aircrew waiver
guide for waiverable conditions and waiver requirements.
   6.2.1. To be considered waiverable, any disqualifying condition must meet the
   following criteria:
       6.2.1.1. Not pose a risk of sudden incapacitation.
       6.2.1.2. Pose minimal potential for subtle performance decrement, particularly with
       regard to the higher senses.
       6.2.1.3. Be resolved, or be stable, and be expected to remain so under the stresses of the
       aviation environment.
       6.2.1.4. If the possibility of progression or recurrence exists, the first symptoms or signs
       must be easily detectable and not pose a risk to the individual or the safety of others.
       6.2.1.5. Cannot require exotic tests, regular invasive procedures, or frequent absences to
       monitor for stability or progression.
AFI48-123_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012                                                               59


       6.2.1.6. Must be compatible with the performance of sustained flying operations.
6.3. Waiver of Medical Conditions. The individuals and organizations with authority to grant
a waiver for medically disqualifying defects are listed in Attachment 2. Controversial or
questionable cases, and cases that fall outside of the parameters set by this instruction, will be
referred to AFMSA/SG3PF at the discretion of the MAJCOMs.
   6.3.1. Initiating Waivers. Forward all relevant medical information through AIMWTS to
   the waiver authority. Special requirements for flying waivers are contained in paragraph 6.2
   6.3.2. Term of Validity of Waivers.
       6.3.2.1. The waiver authority establishes the term of validity of waivers.
       6.3.2.2. An expiration date is placed on a waiver for any conditions that may progress or
       require periodic reevaluation.
       6.3.2.3. Waivers are valid for the specified condition. Any exacerbation of the condition,
       or other changes in the patient’s medical status, automatically invalidates the waiver, and
       they are placed Duties Not Involving Flying (DNIF) until the medical evaluation is
       complete, and a new waiver is requested.
       6.3.2.4. If a condition resolves and member is qualified by appropriate standards, or the
       condition no longer requires a medical waiver, and individual has no other conditions
       requiring medical waiver, retire the waiver using AIMWTS with concurrence of waiver
       granting authority. The individual who retires the waiver must annotate reason and
       MAJCOM point of contact who concurred (by name including the office symbol) in the
       ―Reason for Retirement‖ block, before signing in AIMWTS.
6.4. AFMSA/SG3PF retains waiver authority as follows:
   6.4.1. All initial categorical flying waivers; changes from one category to another; removal
   of a categorical restriction. Note: Consult Attachment 2 for delegation of waiver authority to
   MAJCOM/ SG.
       6.4.1.1. All FCIIU personnel certification and waiver unless otherwise delegated by
       AFMSA/SG3PF.
   6.4.2. All initial waivers in cases previously certified medically disqualified by

   Service), except for those as listed at Attachment 2, Note 3. Exception: MAJCOM/SG
   may grant initial and may renew waivers, if the following two criteria are met: the aviator
   meets entry criteria into an established ACS clinical management/study group(s) and a
   waiver is recommended by the ACS.             Controversial cases will be forwarded to
   AFMSA/SG3PF.
       6.4.4.1. MAJCOM/SGs will not grant/renew waivers for members of active ACS study
       groups without consulting the ACS.

Section 6C— Medical Recommendation For Flying Or Special Operational Duty

6.9. Applicability. Applies to each Air Force MTF or ARC medical squadron/Group providing
support for flying or special operational duty personnel. Use AF Form 1042 to convey updates
AFI48-123_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012                                                               63


and changes to medical qualification for flying or special operational duty. Flying or special
operational duty personnel are defined as any Air Force member with an ASC, AFSC or duty
position that must meet special entry and continuing medical qualifications as defined in 6G ,6H
6I, 6J, and 6K.
6.10. Authority to determine aeromedical dispositions. Non-flight surgeon medical providers
may ground flying or special operational duty personnel. The flight surgeon must document
review and disposition of all non-flight surgeon medical providers’ entries in the member’s
medical record. A grounding AF Form 1042 initiated by a non-flight surgeon medical provider
must be reviewed, countersigned and dated by the flight surgeon. Only a flight surgeon can
return flying/special duty personnel to flying/duty status. Personnel on flying or special
operational duty status who receive dental treatment will be managed IAW AFI 47-101,
Managing Air Force Dental Services. Dental personnel will utilize AF Form 1418 to notify the
flight surgeon of recommended flying or special duty restrictions. The reviewing flight surgeon
should then initiate a DNIF via AF Form 1042. See AFI 47-101, Paragraph 6.16. for further
details.
   6.10.1. Aeromedical Disposition of ARC Personnel On Air Sovereignty Alert (ASA) or
   Federal RPA missions. ARC aviation personnel performing Air Sovereignty Alert (ASA) or
   operating large RPA systems in support of a Federal mission are eligible for active duty
   grounding management (DNIF and RTFS) and care for acute medical conditions that if not
   addressed would negatively impact completion of that mission. Note: Routine medical care
   is not authorized and remains the responsibility of the Airman via his/her regular health care
   provider.
       6.10.1.1. If a flight surgeon is not co-located with the ASA/RPA flying operation, these
       aircrew may be seen by a non-flight surgeon health care provider (military or civilian).
       The aircrew must inform the provider that written or verbal communication of the details
       of the visit (including history, physical, and treatment provided) must be submitted to the
       appointed military flight surgeon immediately following the visit. The flight surgeon
       may render a DNIF or RTFS determination remotely if he/she has sufficient information,
       and after communicating both with the provider and the aircrew member. The flight
       surgeon must be confident that there has been sufficient resolution of symptoms and
       treatment side effects. All relevant medical and medication standards still apply.
       Aeromedical disposition decision must be communicated immediately to the aircrew’s
       unit. The 1042 must be sent electronically to the aircrew’s unit the morning of the next
       duty day.
           6.10.1.1.1. Aircrew and special duty personnel in locations not collocated with an
           active duty base may be returned to flying status to perform alert, combat or National
           Air Defense duties when their unit flight surgeon is not available. These personnel
           may be returned to flying/Special Operations Duty status after being examined by a
           military or civilian physician via ―reach-back‖ consultation with a military Flight
           Surgeon as designated by AFMSA/SGPF.
   6.10.2. Air National Guard (ANG) or Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) Flight Surgeons
   who maintain active credentials and privileges in Flight Medicine may utilize their Flight
   Medicine credentials to make aeromedical dispositions while employed in a civilian Flight
   Medicine physician role.

6.11. Prepare a new AF Form 1042 when an individual is:
   6.11.1. Found temporarily medically unfit—described as DNIF, Duties Not to Include
   Controlling (DNIC) or Duties Not to Include Alert (DNIA).
   6.11.2. Determined by a flight surgeon to be fit for return to flying status (RTFS) or special
   operational duty.
   6.11.3. Medically certified for flying by appropriate review authority following
   disqualification.
   6.11.4. Medically certified for continued flying/special operational duty following medical
   examinations.
   6.11.5. Medically certified by flight surgeon for Incoming Clearance to a new base. This
   new clearance will supersede any previous incoming clearances that must be removed from
   the record at this time.
   6.11.6. To temporarily ―ground‖ or clear aircrew following involvement in any class of
   aircraft mishap.
   6.11.7. To permanently medically disqualify a member for flying or special operational duty.
      6.11.7.1. Only after MAJCOM or higher authority certifies examination in AIMWTS,
      permanent disqualification authority is the same for waiver actions as noted in
      Attachment 2. Also, refer to 6.1.3.1.4.2. Note: An AF Form 1042 does not need to be
      accomplished with the expiration of a flying PHA. The Host Aviation Resource
      Management Office (HARM) Office will take appropriate administrative action if a new
      AF Form 1042 is not received by the end of the member’s birth month.
6.12. Form Completion:
   6.12.1. AF Form 1042 must contain the date the individual is actually found certified.
   6.12.2. Date of the flight surgeon signature will serve as the date the action was
   accomplished.
   6.12.3. If the examination cannot be completed prior to expiration due to reasons beyond the
   member’s control, and the patient has a flying medical waiver that will expire, the examining
   flight surgeon may request a waiver extension from the appropriate MAJCOM/SGP using
   AIMWTS. If granted, a new AF Form 1042 must be accomplished to reflect the extension
   and sent to the member’s HARM Office as specified in this chapter.
   6.12.4. Flyers and special operational duty personnel unavailable for PHA secondary to
   deployment will follow guidance in AFI 44-170.
   6.12.5. The remarks section of the AF Form 1042 can be used for local special purpose
   determinations, i.e., ―May perform Supervisor of Flying (SOF) duties,‖ with the
   determination based upon the flight surgeon’s assessment of the member’s mental alertness
   and physical capabilities. The Remarks section of any AF Form 1042 leaving the MTF will
   not have member’s diagnosis or other protected health care information written or otherwise
   affixed in accordance with HIPAA rules. Commanders must be advised to contact the flight
   surgeons office if more details about a member’s condition are required.
AFI48-123_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012                                                                 65


6.13. Inactive Flyers. Do not complete an AF Form 1042 for individuals in inactive aviation
service categories who are not involved in flying duties, if the medical condition is minor, does
not require a medical waiver, and is expected to resolve within 30 days. Inactive flyers with
ASCs of 6J, 7J, 8J, or 9J (refer to AFI 11-401, Aviation Management) do not require
aeromedical disposition (DNIF) for short term illnesses but must meet retention standards in
Chapter 5. Flyers that develop disqualifying conditions while in inactive status require waiver or
disqualification at the time of diagnosis, despite inactive status. Note: Inactive flyers need to be
evaluated at each PHA for continued qualification to fly.
6.14. AF Form 1042 Distribution:
   6.14.1. Original to patient’s health record. For transient personnel, send the original and 2
   copies to the individual’s home Medical Treatment Facility Flight Surgeons Office for
   distribution.
   6.14.2. Grounding management communications with operational units and HARM offices
   must be treated as Protected Health Information. Release of this information to operational
   units, commanders and HARM offices is allowed under DoD 6025.18-R, DoD Health
   Information Privacy Regulation, paragraph C7.11.1.1., but such releases of PHI must be
   documented IAW paragraphs C1.2.5. and C13.1.
       6.14.2.1. The PIMR database is currently installed with a HIPAA-compliant
       documentation log for any releases of PHI sent via email notification from within PIMR.
       All such actions automatically generate an electronic log entry to document each release
       of PHI. This functionality includes e-mail notification to operational flying/special
       operational duty units and HARM offices regarding AF Form 1042 grounding
       management actions.
       6.14.2.2. In addition to email notifications, a signed copy of the AF Form 1042 must still
       be provided to the HARM office for inclusion in the member’s Flight Record. This
       action constitutes its own release of PHI and must also be documented. To prevent
       unnecessary additional workload, the email notification template in the Grounding
       Management module of PIMR states: ―A signed copy of this grounding management
       action is also being forwarded to the HARM office for inclusion in the member’s Flight
       Record Folder.‖
       6.14.2.3. One copy to the local HARM Office (within 1 duty day) for flying personnel,
       or to the unit commander or supervisor for other personnel utilizing the HIPAA
       compliant documentation log within the e-mail notification the grounding management
       module.
       6.14.2.4. One copy to the member’s unit. Note: Flight medicine clinics maintain current
       and accurate unit and HARM office Point of Contact information in the email notification
       database as HIPAA requires the capability to identify all recipients of PHI.
       6.14.2.5. One copy to the member.
       6.14.2.6. Flying PHA performed by a non-AF flight surgeon requires review and
       certification by parent MAJCOM/SG if no AF flight surgeon is available at that location.
6.15. Disposition of Expired AF Form 1042:
 66                                                  AFI48-123_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012


   6.15.1. Grounding actions such as DNIF, DNIC, DNIA, dispose of when superseded by an
   AF Form 1042 for RTFS action.
   6.15.2. Remove previous Initial Base clearances when superseded by a new Initial Base
   clearance AF Form 1042. Do not remove last PHA clearance on completing a newly
   assigned member’s Initial Base clearance.
   6.15.3. Remove previous PHA clearances when superseded by a new PHA clearance AF
   Form 1042. Do not remove last Initial Base clearance on completing a PHA clearance.
   6.15.4. Do not remove AF Form 1042 recording a member’s RTFS following a period of
   DNIF from the outpatient medical record. These must remain a permanent part of a
   member’s medical record.
6.16. Record of Action. The flight surgeon office maintains a monthly log of restrictions and
re-qualifications on AF Form 1041, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational
Duty Log, and disposes of AF Form 1041 as specified by Air Force Records Disposition
Schedule. Use the AF Form 1041 log to track personnel who are in DNIF, DNIC, or DNIA
status. AF Form 1041 is included within Preventive Health Assessment and Individual Medical
Readiness (PIMR) see AFI 48-101.
6.17. General Officer Notification. The flight medicine PCM will notify their MAJCOM/SG
by telephone during duty hours when a general officer or wing commander is grounded or when
an aircrew or special operational duty member dies. Reports will include: date of DNIF (as
applicable), aeronautical rating, ASC with AFSC, duty title and organization, diagnosis (es),
estimated duration of DNIF (as applicable), and name and duty phone of attending flight
surgeon. Note: ANG does not require notification of the grounding of General Officers or Wing
Commanders.

   6.38.2. The USAF Aircrew Spectacle Frame Program defines and authorizes USAF aircrew
   eyewear. Authorized eyewear are identified under the Aircrew Flight Frame (AFF) series as
   the AFF-OP (AFF), AFF-DR (AFD), and AFF-JS (AFJ). No other spectacle frames are
   authorized for use in USAF aircraft by USAF aircrew or USAF contracted aircrew. These
   modifications were implemented to meet the integration requirements of the new tri-service
   chem/bio protective ensemble called the Joint Service Aircrew Mask (JSAM); the current
   helmet mounted targeting system known as the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System
   (JHMCS); and the new Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) advanced helmet/mask ensemble.
6.39. Prescription Eyewear:
   6.39.1. Local base optometry office is responsible for coordinating (prescribing, ordering,
   fitting, as required) spectacle-based vision correction for USAF aircrew.
   6.39.2. The DOD Optical Fabrication Enterprise will fabricate prescription clear and/or
   neutral density gray (N-15) sun protection as prescribed in an authorized AFF spectacle
   frame. No other sun protection tint or spectacle frame is authorized for use in USAF aircraft
   by USAF aircrew or USAF contracted aircrew. The eye clinic orders the required sets
   through the DoD Optical Fabrication Enterprise in the same manner as other military
   eyewear orders through SRTS Legacy. Eye clinics may also order AFF replacement parts
   (nose pads, temple screws, temples, etc) using unit funds through the Electronic Catalog
   (ECAT) at https://medweb.dscp.dla.mil/pls/prod/logon.
   6.39.3. Aircrew requiring prescription eyewear are authorized two sets of clear and two sets
   of sun protection eyewear (four pairs of spectacles) for flight duties.
   6.39.4. If required for mobility, gas mask inserts are authorized for non-flight duties.
6.40. Non-Prescription Eyewear:
   6.40.1. Non-prescription AFF sun protection is obtained through local Individual Equipment
   Issue (IEI) or equivalent supply office utilizing member’s unit funds.
   6.40.2. Authorized non-prescription sun protection consists of an AFF series spectacle frame
   combined with neutral density gray (N-15) lenses. No other sun protection tint or spectacle
   frame is authorized for use in USAF aircraft by USAF aircrew or USAF contracted aircrew.
   6.40.3. Aircrew not requiring prescription sun protective eyewear or who wear contact
   lenses for in-flight duties are authorized two sets of non-prescription sun protection eyewear
   (two pairs of spectacles) for flight duties.
6.41. Aircrew Spectacles: other considerations:
   6.41.1. Lens Requirements:

   Protective Eyewear List (AFPEL) and provides implementation guidance. The Air Force
   adopted the Army’s Authorized Protective Eyewear List (APEL). Products on the APEL
   have been evaluated by the Army Program Executive Office (PEO Soldier) and found to
   meet or exceed military ballistic standards. BPE is authorized for ground use. Additional
   uses for specific BPE may be authorized for aircrew and be listed on the Flight Protective
   Eyewear List (FPEL). The AFF series frames are not equivalent to BPE. BPE (non-
   prescription spectacle/goggles) is obtained through local Aircrew Flight Equipment or
   equivalent supply office through the member's unit. Prescription inserts for the BPE are
   ordered by the local optometry clinic through the SRTS ordering program.
       6.42.1.1. Current APEL and FPEL available on-line:
          6.42.1.1.1. USAF     Optometry             Knowledge         Junction      /       BPE:

   6.42.2. Aircrew BPE must be approved by the USAF Spectacle Frame Program (POC:
   USAFSAM/FECO). No other BPE is authorized for use by USAF aircrew or USAF
   contracted aircrew.
6.43. Laser Eye Protection (LEP): Prescription LEP Accessory Device Requirements.
   6.43.1. Laser eye protection (LEP) devices are controlled items that protect aircrew from eye
   damage arising from laser threats. Laser eye protection devices are stored and maintained by
   Aircrew Flight Equipment. Prescription LEP accessory devices (typically an insert or outsert
   which attaches to the LEP) are available for most aircrew who require corrective lenses to
   meet vision standards. Not all LEP devices support refractive error correction.
   6.43.2. Aircrew wearing LEP devices who require vision correction may do so by wearing
   contact lenses (see 6.24) or application of a prescription accessory device.
   6.43.3. Regardless of Aircrew Soft Contact Lens Program participation, prescription LEP
   accessory devices, when available, will be ordered for aircrew with refractive error in the
   event contact lens wear is not possible.
   6.43.4. Laser eye protection device availability and designs vary by installation. The flight
   surgeon, in coordination with the ophthalmology/optometry clinics, will communicate
AFI48-123_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012                                                                 75


   directly with Aircrew Flight Equipment to determine the prescription laser eye protection
   accessory device requirement for assigned aircrew.
   6.43.5. The flight surgeon and ophthalmology/optometry clinics will ensure aircrew LEP
   prescription accessory devices, when available, meet individual corrective vision
   specifications and are properly fitted per AFI 11-301v4 (Aircrew Laser Eye Protection).
   6.43.6. Prescription laser eye protection accessory devices are ordered through the Spectacle
   Request Transmission System (SRTS).
   6.43.7. Coordinating References.
       6.43.7.1. TAF 505-87-II-A Operational Requirements Document for Aircrew Laser Eye
       Protection.

Section 6G— Medical Standards for Flying Duty

6.44. Medical Standards. For accessions and enlistments the standards in Chapter 4 apply.
Chapter 5 applies to personnel already serving as active duty or ARC (example, AD SSgt
applying for IFCI duty must meet retention standards in Chapter 5, as well as IFCI standards).
For conditions listed in Chapter 5, ensure a MEB or assignment limitation code fast-track request
has been initiated if appropriate. When a crewmember receives care by a non-flight surgeon
provider, the member must be seen by a flight surgeon for appropriate aeromedical disposition
prior to resuming flying duties. If a flight surgeon is not immediately available, the member will
be removed from flying duties until seen by a flight surgeon or the visit has been reviewed by a
flight surgeon. Note: For medical standards for RPA pilot duties only, refer to Section H.
For flying class I, IA, II, IIU and III. Use of any medication is prohibited, except as described in
the ―Official Air Force Approved Aircrew Medication‖ updated periodically by AFMSA
(approved by AF/SG3P). Use of any Over the Counter (OTC) Medications, except as described
in the ―Official Air Force Approved Aircrew Medications & Over the Counter (OTC)
Medications‖, updated periodically by AFMSA (approved by AF/SG3P) is prohibited. All
medications and immunizations used by flying and special operational duty personnel must be
FDA approved. All FDA approved medications not listed in the ―Official Air Force Approved
Aircrew Medications & Over the Counter (OTC) Medications‖ lists should be assumed to be
disqualifying for flying duty. The aviator may be returned to flying status after the condition has
resolved, the medication has been discontinued, and its effects have dissipated, which usually
entails on additional day (the ―24 hour rule‖).
Acupuncture is permitted for aircrew, ground based controllers, SMOD and special duty
personnel within the following guidelines: No flying/SOD with retained needles; no self–
referrals (must have referral from flight surgeon and note in medical record); treatment must be
done by DoD providers or civilian practitioners within DoD MTFs who are credentialed in
acupuncture treatment; used for short-term treatments only. Acupuncture requires 12 hours post-
treatment DNIF/DNIC and evaluation by flight surgeon prior to RTFS (no automatic RTFS) .
Flight surgeons must consider the patient’s underlying condition and whether or not the
condition itself requires DNIF or waiver.

6.44.4. Hearing.
      6.44.4.1. Flying Class II and III. Hearing loss greater than H-1 profile, or asymmetric
      hearing loss, requires work-up by an audiologist (audiology evaluation for initial waiver
      and waiver renewals must have been accomplished within 12 months of submission to
      waiver authority). Waivers are required for H-3 hearing loss or greater. Indefinite
      waivers are not authorized.
         6.44.4.1.1. For trained assets an H-2 profile alone does not require waiver. However,
         an evaluation sufficient to rule-out conductive or retrocochlear pathology must be
         conducted. This includes full audiologic evaluation and, where appropriate, referral
         for Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) consultation. Referral to ENT may be at the
         discretion of the audiologist or referring facility. Restriction from flying is not
         required during work-up.
         6.44.4.1.2. H-3 profile requires waiver.
             6.44.4.1.2.1. For members with new H-3 profiles (i.e., those whose hearing has
             recently changed to H-3, and who have not been previously worked-up),
             restriction from flying is appropriate. Note: Members with long-standing, stable
             H-3 not previously evaluated by an audiologist and/or ENT, require work-up and
             waiver, but need not be restricted from flying, unless in the opinion of the flight
             surgeon they represent a danger to flying safety.
             6.44.4.1.2.2. Interim waiver may be granted by MAJCOM/SG after
             determination of acceptable hearing proficiency (occupational aircrew hearing
             assessment), pending complete audiology evaluation (indefinite waivers are not
             authorized).
             6.44.4.1.2.3. For actively flying personnel, validate hearing proficiency in one of
             two ways prior to issuance of medical waiver for H-3 profile:
                   6.44.4.1.2.3.1. Inflight hearing test as described in SAM TR73-29, Materials
                   and Procedures for In-flight Assessment of Auditory Function in Aircrewmen

AFI48-123_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012                                                                79


                6.44.4.1.2.3.2. Written validation, signed by the flying squadron commander
                or operations officer, of the adequacy of the member’s hearing to perform
                safely in assigned aircrew duties in the flying environment. This validation
                must be supplemented by the assigned flight surgeon’s written memorandum
                for record stating that speech discrimination levels, according to examination
                by audiologist, are adequate for the performance of flying duties.
            6.44.4.1.2.4. Waiver is contingent upon complete audiologic and where
            appropriate, ENT evaluation. Note: The audiologist must rule out conductive and
            retrocochlear disease. The audiologist may defer ENT evaluation.
            6.44.4.1.2.5. The occupational aircrew hearing assessment is deferred for inactive
            flyers. They may receive a Flying Class IIC waiver specifying the completion of
            the occupational aircrew hearing assessment before return to active flying. The
            pending requirement for operational hearing evaluation upon return to cockpit
            duties must be entered on the AF Form 1042.
     6.44.4.2. Asymmetric hearing loss (greater than, or equal to, 25 decibel (dB) difference,
     comparing left and right ear, at any two consecutive frequencies) requires full
     audiological work-up with further clinical evaluation as indicated, and requires a waiver
     (indefinite waivers are not authorized). Restriction from flying is not required during
     work-up. Also, see aircrew waiver guide.
     6.44.4.3. The following tests are suggested as a complete audiologic evaluation:
         6.44.4.3.1. Pure tone air and bone conduction thresholds.
         6.44.4.3.2. Speech reception thresholds.
         6.44.4.3.3. Speech discrimination testing, to include high intensity discrimination.

         dB HL).
         6.44.4.3.8. Otoacoustic emissions (transient evoked or distortion product).
     6.44.4.4. The following tests may be required if indicated by those listed in 6.44.4.3
         6.44.4.4.1. Auditory brainstem response.
         6.44.4.4.2. MRI. Note: Validation of hearing proficiency for H-3 waivers (initial
         waivers and waiver renewals with a shift of 10 dB or greater on the average for 2,000,
         3,000 and 4,000 Hz from the previous waiver’s audiogram.
     6.44.4.5. Initial Flying Class FCI/IA, II and III must be H1 for selection.

         6.44.5.1.1. Personnel wearing orthodontic appliances need not have appliances
         removed for physical qualification. After consultation with the treating orthodontist,
         the local flight surgeon may qualify the individual for flying duties if there is no
         effect on speech or the ability to wear equipment with comfort.

** Individuals found on routine examination to be 20/20 in one eye and 20/25 with current
corrective lenses, but are correctable to 20/20 O.U. and who have normal stereopsis may
continue flying until the appropriate corrective lenses arrive. These lenses must be ordered by
the most expeditious means.

Notes:
1. All aircrew must be refracted to their best corrected manifest visual acuity. Near vision must
be corrected to 20/20 at the nearest cockpit working distance. Use of spectacles to correct
aircrew’s distance visual acuity to better than 20/20, if possible, must be encouraged. However
spectacle use is at the crew member’s discretion if not required to meet flight standards. See
Section 6F – USAF Corrective Lenses for prescription and non-prescription eyewear
requirements.
2. Cycloplegic Policy: For initial qualification or for waiver consideration, a cycloplegic
refraction must be done using 1% cyclopentolate (Cyclogel®), two drops, 5-15 minutes apart.
Examination will be performed no sooner than one hour after the last drop and within two hours
of the last drop of cyclopentolate. Required data: (1) minimum cycloplegic refractive power
required for each eye to attain a visual acuity of 20/20. – aeromedical baseline; (2) cycloplegic
refractive power required for each eye to attain best corrected visual acuity - clinical baseline.
Note: aeromedical and clinical baseline data may not correlate. If 20/20 visual acuity cannot be
attained under cycloplegic conditions, further clinical evaluation may be required.
3. Optional wear of contact lenses by aircrew members is outlined in Section 6F – USAF
Corrective Lenses. Use of contact lenses for treatment of medical conditions or complex
refractive errors is disqualifying.
4. Use of hard, rigid, or gas permeable (hard) contact lenses within 3 months before the
examination or soft contact lenses 1 month before all initial flying examinations is prohibited.
Document SF 88/DD Form 2808 appropriately to ensure this requirement has been met.
5. Complex refractive errors that can be corrected only by contact lenses are disqualifying.
6. All aircrew members are prohibited from using contact lenses for treatment of medical
conditions unless they have been specifically prescribed and issued or approved by the ACS.

7. Optional wear of contact lenses for aircrew members is outlined in Section 6F.
8. Waivers may only be considered after the individual has a normal ophthalmological
examination, to include a dilated fundus exam and meets the USAF standards with approved
spectacles for aircrew duties (see Section 6F).
9. Near vision must be corrected to 20/20 at the nearest cockpit working distance.
10. Flying Class II/III aviators must be refracted to their best corrected manifest visual acuity.
Use of spectacles to correct aircrew to better than 20/20 if possible, must be encouraged, but is at
the discretion of the crewmember. Continued flying qualification are based on minimum
cycloplegic refraction required to achieve 20/20.
11. For qualification purposes, cycloplegic refraction readings must be recorded for that required
to read the 20/20 line in each eye. However, continue refraction to best visual acuity and report
the best achievable corrected visual acuity as a clinical baseline. (Thus, acuity and refractive
error numbers may not correlate). Cycloplegic refractions that cannot achieve the 20/20 line will
need clinical evaluation or re-evaluation. Cycloplegic Policy: For qualification purposes, a
cycloplegic refraction must be done using 1% cyclopentolate (Cyclogel®), two drops, 5-15
minutes apart. Examination will be performed no sooner than one hour after the last drop and
within two hours of the last drop of cyclopentolate
12. Crewmembers who wear corrective spectacles or contact lenses must carry a spare set of
clear prescription spectacles on their person while performing aircrew duties, see AFI 11-202,
Vol 3, paragraph 6.3. Authorized eyewear are identified under the Aircrew Flight Frame (AFF)
series as the AFF-OP (AFF), AFF-DR (AFD), and AFF-JS (AFJ). No other spectacle frames are
authorized for use in USAF aircraft by USAF aircrew or USAF contracted aircrew. See Section
6F for prescription and non-prescription eyewear requirements.
13. Determine the best possible visual acuity obtained in each eye with the OVT or VTA. The
last row the examinee correctly identified all 10 letters will be recorded as the examinee’s visual
acuity.
   6.44.8. Heterophoria and Heterotropia.
       6.44.8.1. Flying Class III, not required to perform scanner duties (see the enlisted
       classification guide).

       6.44.8.2. Flying Class I, IA, II; and Flying Class III crewmembers required to perform
       scanner duties (see classification guide). If any of these are exceeded, then 6.44.11
       applies. Note: For the purposes of this AFI, scanner duties are defined by the
       requirement to assist with safety clearance checks of their aircraft from outside obstacles,
       within 200 meters.
           6.44.8.2.1. Esophoria greater than 10 prism diopters, at near or distance.

          periodic examinations.
          6.44.8.2.6. History of extraocular muscle surgery or strabismus therapies is
          disqualifying and requires complete evaluation of ocular motility by a competent eye
          care professional to look for residual heterophorias, heterotropias (including
          microtropias), and motor sensory problems. Paragraph 6.44.11 applies.

   6.44.10. Color Vision.
      6.44.10.1. Cone Contrast Test (CCT) equipment will be sent to AF MTFs and ANG and
      AFRC units not co-located with an MTF no later than January 2011. Beginning 1
      January 2011, or upon receipt of CCT equipment, all flying/special operational duty
      personnel or other career fields requiring color vision testing will be tested using both the
      CCT and PIP I/PIP II.

           6.44.10.1.1. Passing score on the CCT is defined as 75 or greater on each of the three
           colors, red, green and blue. For additional implementation instructions and
           disposition of Airmen with failing scores, refer to the AFMS KX at:
           https://kx.afms.mil/kxweb/dotmil/kjPage.do?functionalArea=AerospaceMedicin
           e&cid=CTB_122236.
              6.44.10.1.1.1. PIP I (minimum passing score 12/14, tested monocularly).
Note: All USAFA and ROTC cadets receiving initial flight physicals during the 2009-2010
academic year will be held to the 10/14 PIP I standards. For the purposes of this AFI, the
academic year will end 1 Jul 2010. All other aircrew who were previously qualified for flying
duties based on the previous 10/14 PIP I and fail the new 12/14 PIP I standard will be considered
for waiver in their current weapon system after appropriate evaluation. A formal ophthalmologic
evaluation must be accomplished to determine the type and degree of color vision defect.
              6.44.10.1.1.2. PIP II (minimum passing score 9/10 tested monocularly).
              6.44.10.1.1.3. F2 Plate (able to correctly identify number, location and
              orientation of squares, tested monocularly, performed only during the Medical
              Flight Screening exam).
              6.44.10.1.1.4. Confirmatory testing by the ACS on any history of color screening
              test failure, to include Anomaloscope and Cone Contrast Test, may be required.
       6.44.10.2. Flying Class I. Color vision deficit or anomaly of any degree or type. See
       aircrew waiver guide.
           6.44.10.2.1. All Flying Class I applicants must pass color vision testing during the
           initial FC I exam (PIP 1 and PIP II). If passed, subsequent MFS color vision
           screening testing includes the following approved tests by AF/SG.

              6.44.10.2.1.2. PIP II (minimum passing score 9/10 tested monocularly).
              6.44.10.2.1.3. F2 Plate (able to correctly identify number, location and
              orientation of squares, tested monocularly, performed only during the Medical
              Flight Screening exam).
              6.44.10.2.1.4. Confirmatory testing by the ACS on any history of color screening
              test failure, to include Anomaloscope and Cone Contrast Test, may be required.
           6.44.10.2.2. PIP II (minimum passing score 9/10, tested monocularly).
       6.44.10.3. Flying Class IA/II/III: Must possess normal color vision as demonstrated by
       passing the approved PIP I and PIP II. Testing must be accomplished at each PHA.
       Follow up testing for previously waived color defectives will include at least the PIP I
       and PIP II and other testing as determined by AFMSA/SG3PF. See aircrew waiver guide.
           6.44.10.3.1. PIP I (minimum passing score 12/14, tested monocularly).
           6.44.10.3.2. PIP II (minimum passing score 9/10, tested monocularly).
       6.44.10.4. Color vision screening done at base level must be performed monocularly
       under an approved and standardized illuminant (i.e., MacBeth easel lamp with a 100 watt
AFI48-123_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012                                                             87


     light bulb or a True Daylight AE lamp from Richmond Products). Three or more
     incorrect responses in either eye (including failure to make responses in the allowed time
     interval (no more than 5 seconds)) using either the Dvorine or Ishihara (14 test plate
     version) PIP I, is considered a failure. The same testing conditions and time intervals
     apply for the PIP II. The minimum passing score on the PIP II is no more than one
     incorrect response. No other PIP versions, such as the Richmond PIP, or Beck Engraving
     versions, or other PIP tests for color vision are authorized. Test scores must be recorded
     as number of correct/total number presented. The Farnsworth lantern test (FALANT) is
     not authorized.
     6.44.10.5. Color defective aircrew with a valid waiver may wear issued neutral gray
     tinted sunglasses and laser eye protection when operationally authorized. However,
     aircrew with defective color vision are not authorized to wear the yellow High Contrast
     Visor (HCV).
     6.44.10.6. AFMSA retains certification/waiver authority for all color vision deficiencies.
  6.44.11. Depth Perception/Stereopsis.
     6.44.11.1. Flying Class I, IA, II. Failure of either the Vision Test Apparatus (VTA-DP),
     or its newer replacement, the OVT is considered disqualifying if the failure occurs with
     best corrected visual acuity regardless of level of uncorrected visual acuity. See aircrew
     waiver guide.
        6.44.11.1.1. Failure of the VTA or OVT stereopsis testing requires completion of a
        local preliminary ocular motility and macular examination by an ophthalmologist or
        optometrist, and review by both AETC and the ACS. The test must include all of the
        following:
            6.44.11.1.1.1. Ductions, versions, cover test and alternate cover test in primary
            and 6 cardinal positions of gaze.
            6.44.11.1.1.2. AO Vectograph Stereopsis Test at 6 meters (4 line version).
            6.44.11.1.1.3. AO Suppression Test at 6 meters.
            6.44.11.1.1.4. Randot or Titmus Stereopsis Test.
            6.44.11.1.1.5. Red Lens Test.
            6.44.11.1.1.6. Diopter Base out Prism Test at 6 meters. Note: These tests are
            designed to identify and characterize motility/alignment disorders, especially
            microtropias and monofixation syndrome and are required for new depth
            perception test failure, new diagnosis of ocular motility disorders, depth
            perception waiver renewals, if the previous level of waivered depth perception
            declines. The results of these tests done locally are considered to be preliminary,
            but will be used by waiver authorities to determine whether a candidate must be
            permanently disqualified without any waiver consideration, to identify if there are
            easily correctable causes (i.e., spectacles), and to determine whether further
            evaluation is required. These cases will be reviewed by HQ AETC/SGPS and HQ
            ARC/SGP IAW waiver guide policy.

     6.44.11.2. For FC III, the requirement for normal depth perception is AFSC specific as
     stated in the classification guide per the career field manager. Failure of either the Vision
     Test Apparatus (VTA-DP), or its newer replacement, the OVT is considered
     disqualifying if the failure occurs with best corrected visual acuity regardless of level of
     uncorrected visual acuity.
         6.44.11.2.2. All will be tested. All IFCIII physicals are required to have depth
         perception results recorded even if a specific AFSC does not require the standard to
         qualify for a particular career field. Results must be recorded and information put
         into PEPP and AIMWTS (e.g. VTA-DP fails D, AFSC does not require depth
         perception).
         6.44.11.2.3. For those AFSCs that are identified in the classification guide as
         requiring depth perception, failure of the VTA or OVT stereopsis testing requires
         completion of a local preliminary ocular motility and macular examination by an
         ophthalmologist or optometrist, and review by both AETC and the ACS. The testing
         must be accomplished as listed in 6.44.11.1.1 above.
  6.44.12. Field of Vision.
     6.44.12.1. Flying Classes I, IA, II and III.
         6.44.12.1.1. Contraction of the normal visual field in either eye to within 30 degrees
         of fixation in any meridian.
         6.44.12.1.2. Central scotoma, whether active or inactive, including transitory
         migraine related or any other central scotoma which is due to active pathological
         process.
         6.44.12.1.3. Any peripheral scotoma, other than physiologic.
  6.44.13. Night Vision, Flying Classes I, IA, II, and III. Unsatisfactory night vision is
  determined by history for initial flying. In trained aviators, this history is confirmed, when
  clinically required, by the appropriate electrophysiological tests requested by the
  Aeromedical Consultation Service ophthalmologists. Dark field and empty field myopia due
  to accommodation are normal physiologic responses.
  6.44.14. Red Lens Test.
     6.44.14.1. Flying Classes II and III (except Inflight Refuelers, and scanners):          No
     standards.
     6.44.14.2. Flying Classes I, IA, and III-Inflight Refuelers, and Scanners (as defined in
     the note at 6.44.8.2 and as stated in the classification guide per the career field manager.
     Any diplopia or suppression during the Red Lens Test which develops within 20 inches
     of the center of the screen (30 degrees) is considered a failure. If failed, a complete
     preliminary local evaluation of ocular motility/alignment by a qualified ophthalmologist
     or optometrist as described in 6.44.11.1.1 is then required. The results of these tests done
     locally are considered to be preliminary, but will be used by waiver authorities and the
     ACS to determine whether a candidate must be permanently disqualified without any
     waiver consideration, to identify if there are potentially correctable causes, and to
     determine whether further evaluation is required. The Red Lens Test will be repeated for
     Flying Class I at MFS.

     6.44.15.1. Glaucoma. As evidenced by intraocular pressures of 30 mmHg or greater by
     applanation tonometry, or the secondary changes in the optic disc or visual field
     associated with glaucoma. Trained aircrew with glaucoma require consultation (review
     or evaluation) with the ACS prior to waiver consideration. Note: Pigmentary dispersion
     syndrome (PDS) is not medically disqualifying for flying (includes Initial Flying Classes)
     unless associated with elevated intraocular pressures above 22 mmHg or greater by
     applanation tonometry.
     6.44.15.2. Ocular hypertension (Preglaucoma). Two or more current applanation
     tonometry measurements of 22 mmHg or greater, but less than 30 mmHg, or 4 mmHg or
     more difference between the two eyes. Note: Abnormal pressures obtained by a
     noncontact (air puff) tonometer or Schiotz must be verified by applanation tonometry.

     6.44.16.1. Flying Classes II and III.
         6.44.16.1.1. Pulmonary tuberculosis, including tuberculous pleuritis or pleurisy of
         unknown etiology with positive tuberculin test.
         6.44.16.1.2. History of spontaneous pneumothorax. A single episode of spontaneous
         pneumothorax does not require waiver if PA inspiratory and expiratory chest
         radiograph and thin-cut CT-scan show full expansion of the lung and no demonstrable
         pathology which would predispose to recurrence.
         6.44.16.1.3. Pulmonary blebs or bullae, unless corrected by surgical treatment,
         recovery is complete, and pulmonary function tests are normal.

     6.44.16.2. Flying Classes I and IA. In addition to the above:
        6.44.16.2.1. History of spontaneous pneumothorax. A single episode may be
        considered for waiver after 3 years if pulmonary evaluation shows complete recovery
        with full expansion of the lung, and no demonstrable pathology that would predispose
        to recurrence.
        6.44.16.2.2. Chronic adhesive pleuritis which produces any findings except minimal
        blunting of the costophrenic angles.

           requirements in 6.44.24.1.5 to 6.44.24.1.5.4 In order to be considered for waiver, two
           conditions must be met: individual must have successfully completed treatment
           (defined in 6.44.24.1.5.1 as determined and documented by the MTF Alcohol & Drug
           Abuse Prevention & Treatment (ADAPT) program treatment team; and the individual
           must comply with post-treatment aftercare program requirements (see 6.44.24.1.5.2).
           Also, see Aircrew waiver guide.
              6.44.24.1.5.1. Treatment Program Requirements.            Individuals will have
              successfully completed treatment when the following conditions are met: 1) They
              meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria
              for early full remission of substance dependence or no longer meet diagnostic
              criteria for substance abuse; 2) The treatment team determines, based on DSM
              criteria, individual’s progress towards agreed-upon goals and/or issues as stated in
              the treatment plan; and 3) They remain abstinent without the need for medication.
              6.44.24.1.5.2. Post-treatment Aftercare Program Requirements. The individual
              must remain abstinent without the need for medication, document participation in
              an organized substance use aftercare program (e.g., Alcoholics Anonymous-
              (AA), or other program approved by the MTF ADAPT Program Manager), and
              meet with the designated professionals for the following specific timeframes:

Table 6.3. Aftercare Program Meeting Timeframes
Professional/Meetings              First Year         Second/Third Year      Fourth Year
        Flight Surgeon              Monthly                Quarterly          Annually
           ADAPT                    Monthly                Monthly               N/A

        Social Worker
  Organized substance use          3x weekly              1x weekly         Recommended
      aftercare program                                                     (not required)
Notes:
1. The flight surgeon has primary responsibility for collecting and submitting the required
documentation for waiver submission. The ADAPT representative documents substance use
aftercare program attendance. Temporary modification of aftercare program requirements
because of operational demands must be documented by the flight surgeon.
2. Initial waiver may be requested after ―treatment program completion‖ (as defined in
6.44.24.1.5.1.) and successful completion of 90 days in the post-treatment aftercare program.
              6.44.24.1.5.3. Unsatisfactory Progress in Aftercare Program. The following
              pertain to any individual who fails to remain abstinent or otherwise not comply
              with all aftercare program requirements: Ground the member and arrange for re-
              evaluation by flight surgeon and ADAPT provider to determine potential for re-
              treatment. If member is determined to have potential for re-treatment, follow the
              initial waiver and aftercare program processes. If member is determined not to
              have potential for re-treatment, an AMS must be submitted for permanent
              disqualification.    A second waiver request for substance use disorder
              (6.44.24.1.5) may be considered in accordance with initial waiver requirements,

         but requested no sooner than 12 months from the last date that non-compliance
         with the post-treatment aftercare program was documented. Second waiver
         requests are considered on a case-by-case basis only, and waiver authority for
         these individuals is AFMSA/SG3P.
         6.44.24.1.5.4. As part of the waiver package, the individual states in writing that
         they understand the waiver is valid, only if total abstinence from substance is
         maintained, and that a verifiable break in abstinence, once the waiver period has
         begun, is considered medically disqualifying. This written statement, kept in the
         medical records, must be accomplished at the initial waiver request, and re-
         accomplished each time a waiver renewal is requested.
      6.44.24.1.6. Schizophrenia and other Psychotic Disorders.
      6.44.24.1.7. Mood Disorders.

         6.44.24.1.7.2. Bipolar disorder.
      6.44.24.1.8. Anxiety Disorders. If the flight surgeon determines that the problem is
      due to a non-phobic ―fear of flying‖ or (in a trainee) a ―manifestation of
      apprehension,‖ then the disposition is considered administrative and not medical.
      6.44.24.1.9. Somatoform Disorders.
      6.44.24.1.10. Dissociative Disorders.
      6.44.24.1.11. Sexual paraphilias are not medically disqualifying; however,
      individuals meeting diagnostic criteria are dealt with administratively.
      6.44.24.1.12. Sexual dysfunctions and sexual disorders, not otherwise specified are
      not medically disqualifying unless in association with another Axis I disorder.
      6.44.24.1.13. Sleep disorders, if of such magnitude to warrant somatic treatment
      greater than 30 days duration, or if associated with an Axis I disorder other than an
      adjustment disorder.

      diagnostic criteria for a personality disorder), or a pattern of maladaptive behavior
      that significantly interferes with safety of flight, crew coordination, or mission
      completion. In the absence of maladaptive personality adjustment, traits, or behavior
      patterns, motivational issues are managed administratively and the AR must be rated
      satisfactory.
      6.44.24.1.18. Psychological Factors Affecting Medical Condition.
AFI48-123_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012                                                             103


         6.44.24.1.19. Personality disorder that is severe enough to repeatedly manifest itself
         by significant interference with safety of flight, crew coordination, or mission

RPA systems IAW Joint Concept of Operations for RPA systems. All members must meet
retention standards as outlined in Section 5B and the following additional criteria. Note: For
SUAS-O see 6.48.11.
Aircrew who are previously trained in another weapons system and are temporarily performing
RPA only pilot duties will be held to FCIIU standards below for the duration of their RPA
assignment.
When a crewmember receives care by a non-flight surgeon provider, the member must be seen
by a flight surgeon for appropriate aeromedical disposition prior to resuming RPA duties. If a
flight surgeon is not immediately available, the member will be removed from RPA duties until
seen by a flight surgeon or the visit has been reviewed by a flight surgeon.
   6.45.1. Head. History of head injury is managed as per 6.44.23.1.6
   6.45.2. Ear, Nose, and Throat.
       6.45.2.1. Any disease or malformation of the nose, mouth, pharynx or larynx that might
       interfere with enunciation or clear voice communication.
   6.45.3. Hearing.
       6.45.3.1. For an initial FCIIU an H-1 is required. Any hearing which exceeds H-1
       requires a waiver.
       6.45.3.2. For continued FCIIU duties H-2 profile does not require a waiver. However,
       an evaluation sufficient to rule-out conductive or retrocochlear pathology must be
       conducted. This includes full audiologic evaluation and, where appropriate, referral for
       Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) consultation. Referral to ENT may be at the discretion of
       the audiologist or referring facility. Restriction from RPA duties is not required during
       work-up.
       6.45.3.3. For crewmembers with new H-3 profiles (e.g., those whose hearing has
       recently changed to H-3 and who have not been previously evaluated), restriction from
       FCIIU duties is appropriate. An interim waiver may be granted by MAJCOM/SG after
       determination of acceptable hearing proficiency (e.g., occupational hearing assessment),
       pending complete audiological evaluation. Note: Crewmembers with long-standing,
       stable H-3 profiles not previously evaluated by an audiologist, otolaryngologist, or both
       require work-up and waiver, but need not be restricted from FCIIU duties, unless in the
       opinion of the flight surgeon they represent a danger to flight safety.
       6.45.3.4. For crewmembers actively engaged in FCIIU duties, validate hearing
       proficiency in one of two ways prior to issuance of a medical waiver for H-3 profile:
           6.45.3.4.1. A functional hearing assessment in the ground control station
           environment using the procedures described in physical examination techniques. If
           the crewmember could potentially perform duties in a multi-aircraft control ground
           station, the hearing assessment must be conducted in this environment.
           6.45.3.4.2. Written validation, signed by the flying squadron commander or
           operations officer, of the adequacy of the member’s hearing to perform safely in
           assigned FCIIU duties in the ground control station environment must be
AFI48-123_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012                                                            113


         supplemented by the assigned flight surgeon’s written memorandum for record
         stating that speech discrimination levels, according to the audiologist’s examination,
         are adequate for the performance of RPA duties.
     6.45.3.5. Asymmetric hearing loss (as evidenced by a 25 (dB or greater difference
     between the left and right ears at any two consecutive frequencies) requires full
     audiological work-up with further clinical evaluation as indicated, and requires a waiver
     (indefinite waivers are not authorized). Restriction from FCIIU duties is not required
     during work-up.
     6.45.3.6. The following tests are suggested as a complete audiological evaluation:
         6.45.3.6.1. Pure tone air and bone conduction thresholds.
         6.45.3.6.2. Speech reception thresholds.
         6.45.3.6.3. Speech discrimination testing, to include high intensity discrimination.
         6.45.3.6.4. Immittance audiometry.
         6.45.3.6.5. Tympanograms.
         6.45.3.6.6. Ipsilateral and contralateral acoustic reflexes (levels not exceeding 110
         dB hearing level (HL)).
         6.45.3.6.7. Acoustic reflex decay (500 and 1000 Hertz (Hz), with levels not
         exceeding 110 dB HL).
         6.45.3.6.8. Otoacoustic emissions (transient evoked or distortion product).
     6.45.3.7. The following tests may be required if indicated by those listed above.
         6.45.3.7.1. Auditory brainstem response.
         6.45.3.7.2. MRI.
  6.45.4. Eye.
     6.45.4.1. Lids/adnexa. Any condition of the eyelids which impairs normal eyelid
     function or comfort, or potentially threatens visual performance, including, but not
     limited to epiphora, inflammation or obstruction of the nasolacrimal apparatus, and
     ptosis.
     6.45.4.2. Conjunctiva.
         6.45.4.2.1. Current conjunctivitis, including, but not limited to trachoma and chronic

Section 6I— Ground Based Aircraft Controller

6.46. Ground Based Aircraft Controller Medical Standards. The standards in Section 6I
apply to all ground based aircraft controllers which includes air traffic controller, weapons
controllers/directors, combat controllers and Aerospace Control and Warning Systems (1C5X1),
Tactical Air Control Party (1C4X1), Air Liaison Officer (13LX) and RPA sensor operators
(1U0X1). Conditions in Chapter 5, Continued Military Service (Retention Standards) or WWD
standards also apply. For conditions listed in Chapter 5, ensure an MEB has been performed and
final disposition made prior to submission of a waiver request.
In addition to the standards in Section 6I, Combat Controllers must also meet the relevant
Section 6K categories. Air Battle Managers, Air Weapons Controllers/Directors, required to
perform frequent and regular aerial flights must also meet Flying Class III standards in Section
6G. Pararescuemen must also meet standards in Section 6K.
The medical conditions listed in Chapter 5, Section 6G and relevant Section 6K categories are
cause to reject an examinee for initial controller duty or continued duty unless a waiver is
granted. Acute medical problems, injuries, or their appropriate therapy are cause for withholding
certification of initial training or temporarily restricting the individual from controller duties until
the problem is resolved. These standards are not all inclusive, and other diseases, or defects, can
be cause for rejection based upon the medical judgment of the examining flight surgeon. Acute
conditions which impair safe and effective performance of duty are cause for temporary removal
from controlling duties using AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special
Operational Duty, IAW Section 6C. Note: These standards do not apply to: Small unmanned
aircraft systems operators (SUAS-Os). (See Section 6K 6.48.11.).

       6.46.4.3. Near uncorrected, no standard. Note: Stabilized visual acuity below the above
       level is disqualifying; this includes following refractive surgery. Refractive surgical
       outcomes that interfere with the member’s ability to perform his/her duties are also
       disqualifying. Some occupations, such as combat controllers, must also meet flying class
       III standards; therefore, approved refractive surgery procedures require waiver processing
       because these procedures are disqualifying for the AASD career fields.

   more incorrect responses in either eye (including failure to make responses in the allowed
   time interval (no more than 5 seconds), using either the Dvorine or Ishihara (14 test plate
   version) PIP I, is considered a failure. The same testing conditions and time intervals apply
   for the PIP II. The minimum passing score on the PIP II is no more than one incorrect
   response. No other PIP versions, such as Richmond PIP, or Beck Engraving versions, or
   other PIP tests for color vision are authorized. The FALANT is not authorized.
Note: All other ground based aircraft controllers who were previously qualified for controlling
duties based on the previous 10/14 PIP I and fail the new 12/14 PIP I standard will be considered
for waiver in their current weapon system or AFSC after appropriate evaluation. A formal
ophthalmologic evaluation must be accomplished to determine the type and degree of color
vision defect.


   6.46.7. Depth Perception. No standard except for career fields below:
       6.46.7.1. Tactical Air Control Party (1C4X1), Air Liaison Officer (13LX). Failure of
       either the Vision Test Apparatus (VTA-DP), or its newer replacement, the OVT is
       considered disqualifying if the failure occurs with best corrected visual acuity regardless
       of level of uncorrected visual acuity.
       6.46.7.2. Failure of the VTA or OVT stereopsis testing requires completion of a local
       preliminary ocular motility and macular examination by an ophthalmologist or
       optometrist, and review by both AETC and the ACS. The testing must be accomplished
       as listed in 6.44.11.1.1
   6.46.8. Visual Fields. Any visual field defect.
   6.46.9. Night Vision. Unsatisfactory night vision as determined by history for initial
   controller duty. In trained controllers, this history is confirmed, when clinically required, by

           6.48.8.1.4. Individuals selected for incentive or orientation flights who do not meet
           anthropometric standards will be referred to the flying unit or wing commander (06 or
           above) for final authority disposition. ACES-II ejection attempts above 340 KEAS
           (Knots Equivalent Air Speed) can result in increased injury risk due to limb flail and
           drogue chute opening shock for body weights below 140 pounds. ACES-II ejection
           attempts above 400 KEAS with body weights in excess of 211 pounds increase the
           risk of injury. Commanders may consider weight waivers and/or impose airspeed
           restrictions in the incentive or orientation flight profiles. Commanders waiving
           weight specifications must ensure the individual selected for incentive or orientation
           flight is briefed on the increase of injury risk prior to flight. Buttock-to-knee waivers
           to exceed maximum length are not authorized. The examining flight surgeon and
           MAJCOM/SG do not have waiver authority for indoctrination and incentive flights.

           candidate: (1) Do you have any medical problems? (2) Are you on a DLC? (3) Do
           you take any medications? (4) Do you feel you need to see a flight surgeon? Those
           individuals making any positive responses (YES) on the health statement will be
           referred by the flying unit to the flight surgeon for review, appropriate medical
           examination if deemed necessary and medical recommendation for incentive and
           orientation flying. Candidates must be able to safely egress the aircraft in an
           emergency without endangering life or limb. All civilians selected for incentive or
           orientation flights will complete a locally generated health statement. These health

                      OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH EXAMINATIONS

Section 7A— Occupational Health Examinations

7.1. Purpose. Occupational and Environmental Health Medical Examinations (OEHME) are
done to ensure fitness for duty, to protect the working population by assessing adequacy of
controls, and to identify work-related illness at a sub clinical state where a useful intervention
can be made. The examinations are conducted to assist in maintaining a fit force essential to
mission readiness and to assure the Air Force meets its obligation under Title 29, United States
Code, Sec 651, Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to provide a safe and healthful
workplace. Instruction and guidance for OEHMEs can be found in AFI 48-145, Occupational
and Environmental Health Program, AFOSH 48-20, AFOSH STD 48-137, Respiratory
Protection Program, AFMAN 48-155, Occupational and Environmental Health Exposure
Controls, AFOSH STD 48-8, Controlling Exposures to Hazardous Materials and DoDI 6055.05
Occupational and Environmental Health (OEH).
7.2. Who Receives These Examinations. The need, type and frequency of exams for both
civilian and military workers is determined in the local Occupational and Environmental Health
Working Group (OEHWG), subject to the final approval authority of the physician chair.
7.3. Public Health (SGP for the ARC). Performs administrative quality control
review/oversight on these examinations to ensure completeness. Reports discrepancies to the
Installation Occupational and Environmental Medicine Consultant for review and determination
of appropriate action. Where examinations are completed along with PHA, MTF/CC may
combine PHA and OH reviews to be accomplished concurrently by one section.
7.4. Results of OEHMEs. Results of OEHMEs are maintained in accordance with AFOSH
standards and AFI 48-145 and are one source of input to the multidisciplinary Occupational
Health Program.
7.5. Types of Examinations.
   7.5.1. Clinical Surveillance Examinations. Detailed guidance for clinical surveillance
   examinations are found in AFI 48-145 and DoDI 6055.05.
   7.5.2. Firefighters. DoDI 6055.6, DOD Fire and Emergency Services (F&ES) Program,
   provides instruction for fitness standards for firefighters. HQ AFCESA/CEFX, in
   conjunction with HQ AF/SG3PF, develops National Fire Protection Association Technical
   Implementation Guides (TIGs) for assistance in implementing fitness policy. The TIGs are
   available on the AFCESA’s web site, and www.kx.afms.mil/occdoc. Military firefighters
   with any Category A conditions and Category B conditions (see National Fire Protection
   Association 1582, Standard on Comprehensive Occupational Medical Program for Fire
   Departments) where there is a clear fitness-for-duty issue, or they no longer meet standards
   for continued military service IAW Chapter 5, must be evaluated with adherence to Medical
   Evaluation Board procedures.
7.6. Examination Requirements.

   7.6.1. Examination requirements are determined in the installation OEHWG. The physician
   Chair of the OEHWG is the final approval authority for examination requirements. Details
   on the OEHWG process are found in AFI 48-145.
   7.6.2. Useful guidance for examination criteria is found in DoDI 6055.05, AFI 48-145,
   AFOSH STD 48-137, AFMAN 48-155 and NEHC-TM OM 6260, Medical Surveillance
   Procedures Manual and Medical Matrix.
7.7. Forms Required.
   7.7.1. Standard Form 78, Certificate of Medical Examinations (or equivalent): This form is
   used when the management or the civilian personnel office formally requests an examination
   under 5 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 339, Medical Qualification Determinations.
   This form provides a listing of functional and environmental factors essential to the
   examination and placement of civilian workers.
       7.7.1.1. Management must provide the SF 78, Certificate of Medical Examination, or
       equivalent, and a listing of functional and environmental factors essential to the
       examination and placement of the civilian worker. The medical provider records findings
       and conclusions on the SF 78, or equivalent, and returns page 3 of this form to the
       responsible personnel office. Utilization of DD Form 2766, or equivalent, for additional
       pre-employment examination criteria will provide for one-stop examination and
       established baseline occupational studies.
       7.7.1.2. A copy of the entire form SF 78, or equivalent, must be kept in the worker’s
       medical record. An appropriate medical history must be obtained and documented as
       well (e.g. paragraph 7.7.2).
       7.7.1.3. When completing SF 78 Section D ―Agency Medical Officer‖, the examining
       provider must not make hire/don’t hire/separate/retain determinations. Provider must
       simply describe absence or presence of functional limitations and/or unacceptable
       environmental factors. If a provider feels a condition is disqualifying based on a
       particular medical standard, consultation (at least telephonic) with a Board Certified
       occupational medicine physician must be obtained.
   7.7.2. Standard Form 600, Health Record—Chronological Record of Medical Care or
   equivalent). OEHMEs are recorded on SF 600 forms in AHLTA.
   7.7.3. Other forms. The AF Form 469, AF Form 422, or equivalent, can also be used for the
   communication of functional abilities, as well as a CA-17, CA-20 or other appropriate form.

Section 8A— Overview

8.1. Policy. Do not delay separation or retirement past scheduled date of separation or
retirement to complete a medical examination unless medical hold is approved (see AFI 41-210
for further guidance on Medical Hold authority and related topics).
8.2. Purpose. To identify medical conditions requiring attention and to document current
medical status to determine continued fitness for duty.
8.3. Presumption of Fitness. If performance of duty in the 12 months before scheduled
retirement is satisfactory, the member is presumed to be physically fit for continued active duty
or retirement, unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. (See AFI 41-210 for
presumption of fitness prior to retirement)
8.4. Law Governing Disability Evaluation.
   8.4.1. Title 10, United States Code, Chapter 61 provides for disability retirement and
   separation.
   8.4.2. Title 38, United States Code administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs
   governs disability compensation for ratable service-connected defects that have not precluded
   active service.
   8.4.3. Title 10, United States Code Sec 1145 directs conduct of separation examinations on
   specific individuals leaving the USAF.
8.5. Mandatory Examinations.

   and supporting documents as outlined in 8.5.2 is mandatory when:
       8.5.1.1. Member has not had a PHA within one year. If transferring to ARC, an AF
       Form 422, will be used to document the member’s retention qualification. Members who
       are current on their PHA (within the 12 months preceding the actual date of retirement or
       separation) will complete a DD Form 2697 within 180 days of transfer, from which the
       need for further evaluation will be determined. Potentially disqualifying conditions must
       be appropriately addressed prior to any Palace Chase/Front action
       8.5.1.2. Medical authority requires an examination to be done for either clinical or
       administrative reasons.
       8.5.1.3. Separation is involuntary, or is voluntary in lieu of trial by court martial, or
       retirement in lieu of involuntary administrative separation. Exception: Member is
       separated or retired in absentia.
           8.5.1.3.1. If the member has had an initial enlistment/commissioning examination
           within the preceding 12 months, DD Form 2697 will be the only requirement.
       8.5.1.4. A medical assessment with provider exam as outlined in paragraph 8.5.2 DD
       Form 2697, as a minimum, is required for members having had a PHA within one year of

     be accomplished not earlier than 180 days prior to projected separation or retirement and
     not later than 30 days prior to projected separation or retirement. Exceptions to meet
     mission requirements or short-notice separation/retirement will be handled on a case-by-
     case basis and must include coordination with the Local Veteran’s Administration
     Transition Officials if the member is expected to file a disability claim with the VA. The
     2697 is only required for AFRC members leaving an active duty tour of 31 days or more
     and is not required for retirement purposes if the PHA is current.
     8.5.1.5. The member is tentatively approved by HQ AFPC for early separation from
     active duty and assignment into an ARC under PALACE CHASE, and the member’s
     most recent medical examination (PHA) was completed more than 12 months ago at the

                USAF REFRACTIVE SURGERY (USAF-RS) PROGRAM

Section 12A— General Information and Administrative Procedures

12.1. Applicability. This chapter applies to all AF AD/ARC personnel and establishes
eligibility, procedures, restrictions and recording requirements for Air Force (AF) members
participating in and supporting the USAF Refractive Surgery (USAF-RS) program. ANG
Warfighters are exempt, refer to 12.2.2.1.
   12.1.1. RS is not a TRICARE covered benefit. RS is intended to reduce operational
   disadvantages related to wear and care of spectacles and contact lenses by AF personnel.
   Though RS may be operationally beneficial in some personnel, it is an elective procedure.
   There is no requirement for any member or applicant to obtain any form of RS. Any
   individual planning RS must read and understand the benefits, limitations and risks
   associated with these procedures.
   12.1.2. If applicable AF vision standards cannot be met following RS, the member may be
   disqualified from continued military service. AF AD/ARC members who undergo
   unauthorized RS treatment may be disqualified or restricted from certain duties.
   12.1.3. AF personnel are separated into three Management Groups:
       12.1.3.1. Trained ―aviation and aviation-related special duty‖ (AASD) personnel.
       12.1.3.2. Applicants to AASD.
       12.1.3.3. Warfighter personnel.
   12.1.4. AF AD and ARC Warfighters (eligible for AD elective surgery benefits) are
   authorized treatment at DoD RS centers and post-RS management at their military treatment
   facilities. Aviation and AASD/applicants are managed and authorized treatment as outlined
   in Section 12D and Section 12E.
   12.1.5. ARC personnel who are not eligible for AD elective surgery benefits may undergo
   RS at their own expense at civilian centers. AD and ARC AASD members pursuing
   treatment at civilian RS centers must obtain written approval to proceed from the appropriate
   USAF-RS Program Manager prior to undergoing RS, and meet all pre- and post-operative
   requirements as detailed in Section 12G. ARC Warfighters are exempt from obtaining
   written approval to proceed from the appropriate USAF-RS Program Manager, but they must
   obtain permission from their immediate commander. Additional Air Force guidance for
   elective surgery is found in AFI 41-101, Obtaining Alternative Medical and Dental Care,
   AFI 41-210, and AFI 36-3003.
   12.1.6. Section 12B defines inclusion criteria for the three Management Groups. For
   AASD Management Groups, members must meet both AFSC and ASC requirements. AF
   personnel who do not meet AASD criteria or have been permanently disqualified from
   AASD must comply with requirements of the Warfighter Management Group. A tool to
   assist in Management Group determination is available on the following website: AF KX
162                                                AFI48-123_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012

  http://airforcemedicine.afms.mil/USAF-RS.
  12.1.7. Each Management Group has specific USAF-RS requirements described in detail in
  12D, 12E and 12F respectively.
  12.1.8. For the purpose of this guidance RS authorized for AASD only includes the
  following: Note: See Aircrew waiver guide for specific clinical guidelines.
      12.1.8.1. Advanced Surface Ablation (ASA) procedures.
         12.1.8.1.1. PRK.
         12.1.8.1.2. LASEK.
         12.1.8.1.3. Wave-Front Guided Photorefractive Keratectomy (WFG-PRK).
         12.1.8.1.4. Epi-LASIK.
      12.1.8.2. Intra-Stromal Ablation (ISA) procedures
         12.1.8.2.1. Standard LASIK and its variants.
             12.1.8.2.1.1. DELETED
         12.1.8.2.2. Wave-Front Guided Laser In-Situ Keratomileusis (WFG-LASIK) -
         ―custom ablation‖.
         12.1.8.2.3. Technological advances of the basic LASIK procedure, such as
         femtosecond technology, ―all laser LASIK‖.
  12.1.9. The procedures listed in 12.1.8 are approved for Warfighters. Other FDA-approved
  RS procedures may be authorized for Warfighters based on guidance from the AF/SG
  Refractive Surgery Consultant. However, Radial Keratotomy (RK) is not approved.
  12.1.10. Phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) is a therapeutic application of excimer laser
  technology used for diseases of the anterior cornea. In the context of this guidance, PTK is
  not an RS procedure. PTK is for medical management of corneal anomalies independent of
  the USAF-RS program.
  12.1.11. RS re-treatment is considered a new treatment. Personnel who desire or require re-
  treatment must submit an application IAW with their management group requirements.
  12.1.12. One of the goals of the USAF-RS program is to ensure RS treatment is prioritized
  in accordance with AF mission support. Prioritization categories are based on specific
  management groups and duty requirements. AF members seeking RS are assigned to one of
  these three priority categories:
      12.1.12.1. Priority I: Personnel assigned to AF AASD career fields. Not included are
      permanently disqualified aircrew and/or former aviators who have cross-trained from
      aviation career duties.
      12.1.12.2. Priority II: Personnel whose routine military duties require wear of NVG, eye
      protection, or respiratory protection. This does not include nuclear biological chemical
      (NBC) masks worn only for deployment.

      12.1.12.3. Priority III: Personnel who do not meet any of the above criteria in his/her
      current AFSC.

Section 12B— Management Group Inclusion Criteria

12.2. Management group inclusion criteria. To ensure specific requirements are met,
personnel are assigned to one of three USAF-RS Management Groups: Applicants to AASD,
trained AASD, and Warfighter (all other AF personnel). Warfighter applications are managed
by the Warfighter Program Manager (WPM) and AASD applications are managed by the
Aviation Program Manager (APM). A tool to determine the appropriate RS management group
is available at the AF KX (DotMil): https://kx.afms.mil/USAF-RS or (Public Access):
http://airforcemedicine.afms.mil/USAF-RS.
   12.2.1. AASD management groups: (trained AASD and applicants to AASD).
      12.2.1.1. Trained AASD members are identified by both AFSC and ASC requirements.
      AASD applicants are managed, after training selection, in accordance with their
      anticipated AFSC/ASC. Members who are permanently disqualified from AASD will be
      managed as a Warfighter.
      12.2.1.2. The AASD management groups are for AF members whose primary duties
      involve in-flight and/or altitude chamber exposures including career aircrew who are
      temporarily assigned to non-flight duties, such as staff or educational duties, while
      remaining qualified to return to flight duty. Non-aviation AFSC personnel who are
      currently assigned to perform aviation-related duties, such as parachutists or flight test
      engineers, are also included. AASD personnel assigned to perform aviation-related
      duties are identified as part of the AASD management group as long as they remain
      qualified for their specific aviation-related duties. AASD personnel whose aviation-
      related duties are terminated or suspended will be managed as a Warfighter.
   12.2.2. Warfighter management group:
      12.2.2.1. Includes all other AF personnel not identified as applicant and trained AASD.
      Note: ANG Warfighters are exempt from the requirement to obtain permission to
      proceed with RS from the WPM. ANG AASD personnel must obtain permission to
      proceed with RS from the APM.

                 MOBILITY STATUS AND DEPLOYMENT CRITERIA

Section 13A— General Considerations

13.1. General Considerations. For the purposes of this instruction mobility status is an
ongoing condition where the member is free from any chronic medical conditions or limitations
other than temporary limitations (under 1 year) that would preclude deployment or TDY for six
months in field conditions. A fitness for deployment determination is an assessment of current
medical condition. A deployment is defined as any temporary duty where Contingency,
Exercise, and Deployment temporary duty (TDY) orders were issued, and the TDY location is
outside of the United States. ANG deployment is greater than 30 days regardless of location.
Conditions, which may seriously compromise the near-term well being if an individual were to
deploy, are disqualifying for mobility status or deployment duty. Medical evaluators must
consider climate, altitude, rations, housing, duty assignment, and medical services available in
theater when deciding whether an individual with a specific medical condition is deployable. In
general, a member must be able to perform duty in austere environment with no special food,
billeting, medical or equipment support for up to 179 days. See DoDI 6490.07, Deployment-
Limiting Medical Conditions for Service Members and DoD Civilian Employees for further
information. Note: For DoD civilian employees, DoD Directive 1400.31, DoD Civilian Work
Force Contingency and Emergency Planning and Execution, and DoDI 1400.32, DoD Civilian
Work Force Contingency and Emergency Planning Guidelines and Procedures, See DoDI
6490.07, Deployment-Limiting Medical Conditions for Service Members and DoD Civilian
Employees and AFI 36-507, Mobilization of the Civilian Workforce apply. Civilian Contractors
shall follow DoDI 3020.41, Contractor Personnel Authorized to Accompany the U.S. Armed
Forces.
   13.1.1. Individuals returned to duty as ―fit‖ by PEB may not meet deployment standards.
   Such individuals, if they are retained, will have assignment limitation codes limiting or
   restricting them from deployment duties or be placed on Limited Assignment Status (LAS).
   They may be assigned or deployed with appropriate coordination per AFI 41-210.
   13.1.2. The standards listed in 13.2. are the minimum necessary to maintain mobility status,
   and are listed in addition to the accession, retention, and general fitness for duty standards.
   The standards also will be applied to any deploying active duty or ARC member, including
   members who have completed either a MEB, PEB or assignment limitation code fast track.
   Any individual, who cannot maintain mobility status for a chronic or recurrent medical
   condition must meet an MEB or assignment limitation code fast track. Note: Pregnancy does
   not require an MEB and is handled as a code 81 mobility restriction annotated on an AF
   Form 469. Any mobility (or TDY) restrictions following completion of pregnancy are
   detailed in AFI 36-2110, Assignments.
   13.1.3. ARC members must have deployment criteria addressed in the Narrative Summary
   submitted in the Worldwide Duty Medical Evaluation package for the purpose of enabling
   the ARC/SG to make a valid deployability determination. The provider submitting the
   request must consider the standards in 13.2 in the narrative summary.
13.2. Standards. To be deployable, an individual must:
176                                                   AFI48-123_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012


  13.2.1. Be able to perform duties for a prolonged period (12 hours or more).
  13.2.2. Be able to subsist on field rations for up to four months.
  13.2.3. Be free of medical conditions, including pregnancy, which require special
  appliances, or frequent treatment or follow up by medical specialists or sub specialists not
  readily available in theater. Any chronic medical condition that fails to respond to adequate
  conservative treatment or that necessitates significant limitation of physical activity must be
  considered non-deployable.
      13.2.3.1. Any individual having a deployment or assignment cancelled due to medical
      reasons must be referred to the DAWG within 10 calendar days for appropriate action
      (See 5.3.20.7.)
  13.2.4. Be free of physical or psychological conditions resulting in the inability to wear or
  use all required items of uniform or personal protective equipment, including protective
  mask, ballistic helmet, body armor, and chemical/biological protective garments, regardless
  of the nature of the underlying condition if wearing such equipment can be reasonably
  anticipated or required in the deployed location.
  13.2.5. Be able to perform heavy physical work over at least short periods of time. This
  includes the ability to carry all required deployment baggage (at least 40 lbs) and to run at
  least 100 yards.
  13.2.6. Have adequate unaided hearing to perform duties safely. The requirement for use of
  hearing aids does not necessarily preclude deployment or mobility status.
  13.2.7. Have adequate night vision to be able to travel unassisted at night.
  13.2.8. Have corrected visual acuity that is sufficient to meet job requirements and safely
  perform duty.
  13.2.9. Be able to perform duties in hot and cold environments.
  13.2.10. Be free of any medical condition that could result in sudden incapacitation,
  including a history of stroke within the last 24 months, seizure disorders and diabetes
  mellitus, requiring any medication for control. No recurrent loss of consciousness for any
  reason.
  13.2.11. Be able to travel by air, land or sea.
  13.2.12. Must be free from conditions that preclude or limit certain immunizations or use of
  force health protection prescription products required for the specific deployment.
  Depending on the applicable threat assessment required force health protection products may
  include: atropine, epinephrine, and/or 2-pam chloride auto-injectors, certain antimicrobials,
  antimalarials, and pyridostigmine bromide. Any military member with a vaccination allergy
  must be evaluated by a credentialed military allergist to determine limitations in vaccination
  receipt. Note: Individuals who are unable to receive the smallpox vaccine before relocation
  may still be qualified for duty in areas that are identified as a higher threat for smallpox since
  vaccination can be given up to four days after exposure. The decision to deploy or assign
  personnel who cannot be pre-vaccinated against smallpox must be based on theater or NAF
  policies or, where allowed, local commander consideration of factors such as risks to the
  individual and the mission.
AFI48-123_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012                                                             177


   13.2.13. Be free from active tuberculosis or known blood-borne disease that may be
   transmitted to others in a deployed environment. Note: Before a member with a diagnosis of
   HIV seropositivity with progressive clinical illness or immunological deficiency is deployed,
   the gaining Combatant Command Surgeon must be consulted and grant medical clearance for
   deployment per DoD policy.
   13.2.14. Not have a history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft, coronary
   artery angioplasty, carotid endarterectomy, other arterial stenting or aneurysm repair within
   one year of deployment.
   13.2.15. Not have symptomatic coronary artery disease.
   13.2.16. Not have cardiac dysrhythmias or arrhythmias, either symptomatic or requiring
   medical or electrophysiologic control (presence of an implanted defibrillator and/or

   requires frequent monitoring.
   13.2.18. Have a dental exam within the last 12 months, not be likely to require dental
   treatment or reevaluation for oral conditions that will result in dental emergencies within 12
   months. Note: Individuals being evaluated by a non-DoD civilian dentist must use a DD
   Form 2813, DoD Active Duty/Reserve Forces Dental Examination, as proof of dental
   examination. Note: See AFI 10-250, Individual Medical Readiness, 2.3.2.6 and AFI 47-101,
   6.10.5.3 for additional guidance.
   13.2.19. Not have a history of Psychotic and/or bipolar disorders, requiring ongoing
   treatment with antipsychotics, lithium, or anticonvulsants. Member must not experience
   residual symptoms that impair duty performance nor suffer from a condition which would
   pose a substantial risk for deterioration and/or recurrence of impairing symptoms in the
   deployed environment.
      13.2.19.1. Other psychiatric disorders requiring treatment or frequent follow-up must
      have at least three months of demonstrated stability before they can be considered
      deployable.
13.3. Non-mobility status personnel (ALC-C1, 2, 3 or LAS or ANG members with a
condition waived for worldwide duty) who have existing medical conditions may deploy if
all of the following conditions are met.
   13.3.1. The condition is not of such a nature that an unexpected worsening or physical
   trauma is likely to have a grave medical outcome or negative impact on mission execution.
   13.3.2. The condition is stable and reasonably anticipated by the pre-deployment medical
   evaluator not to worsen during the deployment under care in theater, in light of physical,
   physiological, psychological, and nutritional effects of the duties and location.
   13.3.3. Any required ongoing health care or medications must be available in-theater within
   the military health system. All special requirements (e.g. special handling, and storage) must
   receive prior approval by gaining COCOM.

   13.3.4. There is no need for, or anticipation of, a need for duty limitations that preclude
   performance of duty or accommodation imposed by the medical condition (the nature of the
   accommodation must be considered).
   13.3.5. There is no need for routine evacuation out of theater for continuing diagnostics or
   other evaluations. (All such evaluations must be accomplished prior to deployment).
   13.3.6. Coordination with deployed commanders (or delegated waiver authority) may be
   required based on current conditions, host nation requirements or changing mission
   requirements.
13.4. Personnel with the following conditions may not deploy.

 192                                                  AFI48-123_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012


2. AF/SG (Headquarters United States Air Force Surgeon General) is the ultimate waiver
authority for all medical waivers. AF/SG has delegated waiver authority to AF/SG3PF,
specifically to the USAF Consultant for Aerospace Medicine. Other delegation of certification
or waiver authority is only as designated in this instruction.
*3. Authority to grant categorical Flying Class II with suffixes A, B, or C and IIU and Flying
Class III waivers with scanning restrictions is retained by AF/SG3PF, unless delegated in this
AFI or re-delegation memorandum.
3.1. Exceptions.
3.1.1. Flying Class IIA. MAJCOM/SG may grant the following FCIIA waivers:
3.1.1.2. Initial and renewal for asymptomatic moderate aortic insufficiency (AI) or with
otherwise non-disqualifying ventricular dysrhythmias, which are considered possibly related to
AI (no evidence of left ventricular enlargement or dysfunction) for members seen or case,
reviewed at the ACS.
3.1.1.3. Initial and renewal for Minimal Coronary Artery Disease (MCAD) for members seen or
case reviewed at the ACS.
3.1.1.4. Initial waiver for Aerospace Medicine Primary (AMP) course applicants who possess

AF/SG3PF.
3.1.3. Flying Class IIC. MAJCOM/SG may grant initial waiver (and renewal) only for the
following:
3.1.3.1. H-3 Profile (inactive flyers). The following restriction applies: ―An occupational cockpit
hearing evaluation/assessment is required prior to reassignment to active flying.‖
3.1.3.2. Pregnancy. AF/SG3PF has delegated this waiver to the MAJCOM who may delegate
further if desired.
*3.1.4. Other. MAJCOM/SG may grant initial and renewal waivers for all routine ACS clinical
management group evaluations as defined by the ACS. Controversial cases will be forwarded to
AF/SG3PF. MAJCOM/SG will forward a copy of all FCIIA/B/C actions (memorandum cover
letter) as follows: FCIIA, B, or C: forward copy to AFPC/DPAOT3, 550 C Street West Ste 31,
Randolph AFB, TX 78150. Colonel (0-6) forward copy to: AFSLMO/CA, 2221 S. Clark Street,
Crystal Plaza 6, Ste 500, Arlington, VA 22202. All FCIIC waiver actions delegated to
MAJCOM/SG require memorandum cover letter by MAJCOM/SG be forwarded to AF/SG3PF,
1500 Wilson Blvd, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA, 22209 and USAF/A3OT, 1480 AF Pentagon
Washington, DC 20032-1480, to include FCIIC waiver renewals. Ensure the restrictions are
contained in the memorandum. Note: ARC does not have the requirement to forward FCIIA,
FCIIB, and FCIIC waivers to AFPC/DPAO.
AFI48-123_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012                                                               193


4. Certification and waiver authority for USAF flying personnel while assigned to the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is NASA.
*5. AFMC/SG has certification and waiver authority on USAF Test Pilot School/Flight Test
Engineer applicants, except as noted in 6.4. May be further delegated at AFMC/SG discretion.
6. AFRC SG and ANG/SG is the certification authority for their assigned personnel who apply
for the AMP course.
*7. Non-rated applicants for flying duty (Class III) and Flight Nurse applicants, who are
currently medically qualified and performing flying duty, do not require additional review and
certification or reexamination prior to retraining unless the individual is applying for Inflight
Refueling Duty, SERE Specialist, Combat Control Duty, Pararescue Duty, Combat Rescue
Officer, or the individual is on a medical waiver. Note: Enlisted members applying for
commissioning may use their most current PHA and completed AF Form 422 noting qualified
for GMS, Commission and Retention, in lieu of accomplishing another physical for the specific
purpose of commissioning. A current AF Form 422 must accompany all cross-training
applications.
*8. The authority for ANG is ANG/SG; the authority for Reservists (all categories) is AFRC/SG.
*9. AETC/SGPS is the certification authority for those individuals undergoing Basic Military
Training School (BMTS). For ARC members undergoing BMTS, ARC SG will coordinate
medical disposition.
10. Responsibility for medical waivers has been delegated as follows: Air Force District of
Washington (AFDW) is delegated to AMC/SGPA: Others: Air Force Element (AFELM),
Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center
(AFOTEC), if not otherwise specified in Table A2.1. (to include Notes), will be the medical
facility’s MAJCOM/SG that submits the aeromedical waiver examination package. Waiver
authority for AFIA is delegated to AFIA/SG when that position is filled by a RAM. Medical
waiver authority for personnel assigned to USSOCOM is delegated to AFSOC/SG. Medical
waiver authority for personnel assigned to NORTHCOM is delegated to AFSPC/SG.
11. Medical waiver authority has been delegated to the MAJCOM to which the member is
assigned for duty (e.g., member’s MAJCOM is ACC, but they are assigned PCS to USAFE,
PACAF, etc., for duty, that MAJCOM becomes the certification and waiver authority in
accordance with Table A2.1.).
12. AETC/SGPS is sole certification and waiver authority for applicants applying for the Combat
Control, Combat Rescue Officer or Pararescue Duty career fields.
13. Applicants who previously held a commission for 6 months or more in any service
component and who are within 6 months of separation or non-participant status, will not require
their physical exam to be reviewed or certified by AFRC/SG prior to being commissioned in the
reserve program, unless the applicant does not meet the medical requirements IAW AFI 48-123,
 194                                                   AFI48-123_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012


Chapter 5.
14. Local Base Certification/Waiver Authority (active duty only). Flight surgeons (AFSC
48X3/4), normally the Aerospace Medicine Squadron/Flight Commander, or the senior squadron
medical element (SME) flight surgeon (tenants only), as specifically identified by the parent
MAJCOM, retain this authority. This authority will not be delegated further. At locations with
flight surgeons who do not meet these criteria, the certification/waiver authority reverts to the
MAJCOM of assignment. Non-flight surgeons are not authorized to sign, or certify medical
examinations. Flight surgeons granted this authority by their MAJCOM may not certify/waiver
ARC aircrew members. Note: Limited scope MTFs may delegate to a supporting MTF’s
Senior Aeromedical Specialist with MAJCOM approval and delegation.
15. Active duty non-aircrew members transitioning into ARC flying positions must have their
medical examinations certified by the appropriate ARC Surgeon.
16. The final signature on SF 88 or DD Form 2808 in PEPP for Initial Flying Class
I/IA/II//IIU/III and Special Operation Training examinations is the local SGP. The final review
authority on all other examinations requiring this signature is the senior flight surgeon assigned.
17. State certification/waiver authority (ANG only). State Air Surgeons who are current,
certified, and trained as specifically identified by NGB/SGPA retain this authority. This
authority will not be delegated further. At locations where State Air Surgeons are not assigned,
or are not trained, the certification/waiver authority reverts to NGB/SGPA.
18. Delegation of this certification authority is extended only to those Reserve Medical units
responsible for providing physical exam support.
19. The appropriate ARC SG is the certification/waiver authority for AGR tour applicants with
disqualifying Chapter 5 medical conditions; disqualifying Chapter 6, Section 6G medical
conditions; MAJCOM level tours; and AGR tours with no supporting ARC medical unit.
20. AETC/SGPS is the certification and waiver authority for all ARC members entering active
duty in the regular Air Force. Before ARC members will be considered for waiver for active
duty in the regular Air Force, all disqualifying defects must be noted, reviewed, evaluated and
waived by the ARC waiver authority. Waiver by the ARC authority does not guarantee waiver
for regular Air Force duty.
21. Verbal waivers are not authorized. If an extension to an existing waiver is warranted, waiver
extension must be recorded in AIMWTS and a new waiver renewal initiated at base level.
Note: For example, if a local base flight surgeon requests an extension of sixty days to complete
required tests, examinations, specialty consultations, etc., then the appropriate waiver authority
may grant that waiver with an expiration date of sixty days in AIMWTS. The base level flight
surgeon must then initiate a waiver renewal in AIMWTS.
22. MAJCOM certification and waiver authority:
AFI48-123_AFMCSUP_I 19 JULY 2012                                                            195


Certification and waiver authority of medical standards may only be accomplished by a specialist
in aerospace medicine. MAJCOM/SGs who are not RAMs will delegate their authority to an
aerospace medicine specialist on their staff. When no RAM is assigned to the MAJCOM staff
the waiver authority will be retained by AF/SG3PF unless delegated in writing by AF/SG3PF to
a designated flight surgeon.
23. AETC/SGPS will retain waiver authority for UPT students from successful completion of an
IFC physical and MFS, until they complete pilot training.
24. AETC/SG is the certification and waiver authority for individuals who do not meet standards
and may delegate this authority to AETC/SGP and or SGPS. AF/SG3P retains waiver authority
for those conditions it normally waives.
25. AFRC/SG is the authority for disqualifications.
26. AFRC/SG is waiver authority for all AD members entering the AF Reserve. Before AD
members will be considered for waiver for the AF Reserve, all disqualifying defects must be
appropriately evaluated for FFD per AFI 48-123, Chapter 5. Waiver by the AD authority does
not guarantee waiver for AF Reserve duty.

A3.3. H-3 Profile. The H-3 profile is disqualifying for enlistment, and civilian commission. It
requires evaluation and MAJCOM waiver for continued flying, and Audiology evaluation for
fitness for continued active duty. Aircrew with H-3 who change aircraft require an in-cockpit
evaluation prior to waiver consideration.
      A3.3.1. Definition: An H-3 profile is any loss that exceeds the values noted above in the
      definition of an H-2 profile.
A3.4. H-4 Profile. These require evaluation for continued service via either ARC Fitness for
Duty (FFD), Worldwide Duty (WWD) processing, or review by the DAWG IAW AFI 10-203
for RTD, ALC Fast Track, or MEB.
      A3.4.1. Definition: Hearing loss sufficient to preclude safe and effective performance of
      duty, regardless of level of pure tone hearing loss, and despite use of hearing aids. This
      degree of hearing loss is disqualifying for all military duty.
Notes: All personnel working in hazardous noise areas will be enrolled in the Hearing
Conservation Program. The Air Force Hearing Conservation Program directive (found in
AFOSH 48-20, Occupational Noise and Hearing Conservation Program must be consulted.
Standard threshold shifts must be appropriately recorded and addressed whenever a significant
shift in measured hearing threshold is noted. Such a shift may not result in a profile change.
Exceeding the definition/standard for H-1 or H-2 automatically places the individual in the next
highest category.
