     large containers into position.
     4.2. Handle explosives under the supervision of competent personnel who thoroughly
     understand the hazards and risks involved. It should be stressed to all personnel handling
     explosives that their own safety and the safety of others depends on intelligent, skillful, and
     careful munitions handling procedures demonstrated by all involved.
     4.3. Ensure all personnel are briefed on the hazards involved, the emergency evacuation
     distance in the event of a mishap, personnel/explosive limits, and emergency procedures

     2007. Bldg 9 is in explosive arc. Explosive vehicles are authorized temporary parking for
     minimal time at Bldg 9. These vehicles are in transportation mode, and Quantity-distance (Q-
     D) criteria does not apply IAW AFMAN 91-201 Para 12.67.5 ―Q-D criteria does not apply to
     munitions and explosives in the transportation mode. Take precautions to ensure minimum
     exposure of people and property during all phases of transportation. The time munitions and
     explosives are in the transportation mode must be limited to the absolute minimum necessary
     to complete the task.‖
