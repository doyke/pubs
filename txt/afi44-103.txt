SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision reflects significant changes and should be reviewed in its entirety. The changes
include reflecting the change of the office symbol for the Aerospace Medical Career Field
Manager to SG1E. Clearly identifies the MTF commander as responsible for the IDMT(s) and
the overall management of the program. Removes Mobile Medical Unit (MMU) as a term used
to identify units which have IDMTs assigned since most are similar to Squadron Medical
Elements (SME) in function. Directs the local MTF Resource Management Office (RMO) to
allocate funds for the IDMT program to include TDY enroute funding for IDMTs at remote
locations requiring initial and sustainment training. Expands IDMT Program Coordinator roles
which include maintenance of each IDMTs required documentation for 2 years and removal of
the requirement to maintain the Competency Assessment Folder. Requires quarterly reporting of
status of training to the MTF commander, SGH, Chief Nurse and MTF 4N Functional Manager
via Executive Committee of Medical Staff (ECOMS) and to the MAJCOM 4N Functional
Manager. Clarifies the role of the IDMT in garrison in regards to providing patient care to their
full scope of practice as a physician extender. Directs that IDMTs who are assigned to short-tour
locations (12 or 15-month tours) will not be required to complete annual sustainment training
during that particular short tour. The orientation/initial certification at the HMTF will provide
the certification required for the entire length of the short tour. Increased number of patients
required to be seen to 20 for initial training and 80 for sustainment training. Clarified
sustainment training to be accomplished over a 12 month period.

   not designed to decide if a person is fit to practice, it is a tool for deciding whether an
   individual’s medical condition limits their assignment/deployment options.
   2.6.2. The PEB sets a disability rating for the medical condition. Some medical conditions
   can produce a significant level of disability that markedly interferes with functional ability. If
   the individual is not qualified to hold the AFSC, withdrawal actions according to AFI 36-
   2101 will apply. (T-1)

3.1. Medical Treatment.
   3.1.1. IDMTs perform all medical and dental treatment using the USAF Independent Duty
   Medical Technician (IDMT) Medical and Dental Treatment Protocols. These protocols, in-
   conjunction with part II of the 4N0X1 CFETP, define the scope of practice for IDMTs.
   Physician preceptors/on-call physicians and dental preceptors may, on a case-by-case basis,
   approve deviation from the prescribed USAF Independent Duty Medical Technician (IDMT)
   Medical and Dental Treatment Protocols. In this case, the provider and IDMT must
   document the deviation in the patient’s medical record and on AF IMT 4336 or locally
   developed/approved form approved by MAJCOM Functional Manager.
       3.1.1.1. Patients with chronic problems are referred to a physician or dentist as
       appropriate. Medical or dental preceptors may give IDMTs written instructions defining
       their involvement in caring for patients with these conditions.
3.2. Medical Communication. The IDMT must immediately contact the HMTF physician
preceptor, or on-call physician, when in doubt about a diagnosis/treatment, when dispensing any
medication coded MD on the IDMT authorized drug formulary or when protocols require. (T-1)
3.3. Minor Surgical Procedures. The IDMT’s scope of practice is limited to wound closure,
toenail removal, and opening/draining small abscesses. The IDMT may not suture lacerations
crossing a vermillion border, the eyelid, cartilage such as the ear or nose, openings over joint
spaces that involve tendons or where deep muscle is exposed, the genital or anal region, and the
palms of hands or soles of feet unless directed by preceptor. In cases where re-approximating a
wound may be detrimental to the patient, the IDMT must consult the physician preceptor.
Before performing any minor surgical procedures, the IDMT must obtain the patient's consent on
SF 522, Medical Record Request for Administration of Anesthesia and for Performance of
Operations and Other Procedures.(T-1)
3.4. Medications.
