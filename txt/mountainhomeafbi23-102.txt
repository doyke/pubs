       2.1.1. Ensure proper collection, segregation, handling and disposal of water and
       contaminated fuel is accomplished IAW federal, state and local environmental law.
       Ensure unit hazardous waste (HAZWASTE) monitors set up accumulation points to
       dispose of contaminated fuel.
       2.1.2. Prior to use, inspect the bowser and if any discrepancies are noted that cannot be
       corrected by generating activity, report to Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE).
       2.1.3. Ensure bowsers contain no visible water or other contaminants, to include
       chemical or solid objects such as wire, nuts, bolts, etc., and bowsers are not over-filled,
       leaking or have discrepancies which could compromise the safety or do harm to the
       environment. Bowsers containing fuel with dyes can be defueled if the 366th Logistics
       Readiness Squadron, Fuels Management Flight (366 LRS/LGRF) is notified prior to
       defuel operation.
       2.1.4. Notify MOC for after hour emergencies or when weekend bowser defuel support
       is required.
       2.1.5. If a bowser requires emptying after hours or on weekends, the generating activity
       will provide an individual to be present while the bowser is emptied. Safety procedures
       necessitate the presence of two individuals for such an operation. Fuels bulk storage only
       has one individual working after hours and on weekends.
       2.1.6. Empty bowsers are picked up within 24 hours of notification.
       2.1.7. Provide or arrange transportation of products to the fuels bulk off-loading headers,
       Monday through Friday, 0700-1500. After hours, emergency or weekend support is
       available by notifying the Fuels Service Center (FSC) at 828-6000, building number
       1319. If the gates to the parking area are closed, call FSC to ensure bowsers are not left
       in the street.
       2.1.8. Contact a fuels representative to inspect, sample and accept bowser upon delivery
       to fuels bulk storage. Remove bowsers not accepted. The generating activity is
       responsible to correct the discrepancy.
    2.2. 366 FW/CPM will:
       2.2.1. Notify generating activity to pick up empty bowsers with 24 hours.
       2.2.2. Notify generating activity when bowsers fail visual inspection performed by fuels
       management.
       2.2.3. Notify FSC of after hour emergencies or when weekend defueling support is
       required.
    2.3. 366 LRS/LGRF will:
       2.3.1. Take a visual sample of each bowser to ensure product quality. Samples should
       look clear to straw in color, free of visual water and particles in order to be defueled.
       2.3.2. Defuel reclaimed JP-8 fuel bowsers a minimum of once a day, if required.
       2.3.3. Generate the applicable paperwork, giving the appropriate squadron credit for the
       quantity of fuel having defueled.

      2.3.4. Notify MOC of problems associated with fuel bowsers.
      2.3.5. Notify MOC after bowsers are emptied.
   2.4. AGE will:
      2.4.1. Perform, track and schedule periodic inspections and special inspections (to
      include marking and corrosion prevention) on drained bowsers.
      2.4.2. Perform unscheduled maintenance (broken components, flat tires, etc.) on drained
      components.
