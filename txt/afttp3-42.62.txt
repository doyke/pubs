                                           MISSION

1.1. AFSOC Medical Mission Statement. The AFSOC medical mission is two-fold: (1)
Deploy with, and in support of (ISO), SOF in order to (IOT) deliver SOF combat medical
support and to modernize and advance SOF medical capabilities, medical technologies IOT
maximize war-fighter performance; and (2) Provide high quality, state-of-the-art prevention-
based health care for Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) members, families and
beneficiaries.

1.2. AFSOC Medical Capabilities. AFSOC medics provide a comprehensive medical
platform for SOF personnel across the health care continuum--prevention through intervention
and rehabilitation. AFSOC medics ensure deployable medical support to AFSOC forces via the
employment of AFSOC medical unit type codes (UTCs). AFSOC medics deploying with SOF
IOT provide preventive healthcare, routine healthcare, urgent/emergent point-of-injury trauma
care, forward resuscitative/stabilization surgery, intensive care, casualty evacuation (CASEVAC)
and critical care casualty evacuation. Additionally, SOF medics provide medical support for
humanitarian operations, noncombatant evacuation operations (NEO), civil affairs (CA)
missions, irregular warfare (IW), unconventional warfare (UW) missions, foreign internal
defense (FID) missions, healthcare engagement, healthcare capacity building and health care
infrastructure development capabilities ISO counterinsurgency (COIN) operations,
stability/security operations, and medical support for other unique US Special Operations
Command (USSOCOM) missions/taskings.

1.3. The Challenge of AFSOC Medicine. Provide the highest quality healthcare/health
service support for AFSOC and joint SOF, frequently without the benefit of additional pillars of
health services support, and often without the benefit of fully developed capabilities of care in
areas of significantly higher medical and operational threat/risk.

1.4. SOF Psychology Mission. The AFSOC SOF Psychologist is a member of the
commander’s staff that provides psychological support, consultation, and management for SERE
repatriation resources and processes as specified by the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency
(JPRA). They are responsible for critical incident and return to duty (RTD) consultation related
to mishaps and isolated or returned persons. They provide psychological consultation and
intervention on human performance and resource optimization for assigned SOF personnel. The
psychologist also consults with commanders on selection and placement of special duty
personnel as required and advises information operations, and Military Information Support
Operations (MISO) planners. The roles and functions of SOF Psychologists will be IAW the
current American Psychological Association ethics code.

                                       INTRODUCTION

2.1. Purpose. This document describes the tactics, techniques, and procedures for UTC FFQE7,
Med SOF Operational Psychology.

2.2. Background. In response to increasing requirements by operational commanders, the Air
Force’s application of psychological assets has evolved and AFSOC has been instrumental. This
has been most evident among a small community of operational psychologists. Shortly after
AFSOC’s inception, it began to integrate psychological support into its war-fighting units. The
first of these positions was placed within the Operations Support Medical (OSM) flight in the 1st
Special Operations Support Squadron (SOSS) at Hurlburt Field, FL and later at the 27th Special
Operations Group (SOG), Cannon AFB, NM. The OSS/OSM is solely focused on integrated
deployable support for the 1st and 27th Special Operations Wings (SOW). AFSOC has also
assigned psychologists to its Special Mission Units (SMU) and created a position within the HQ
AFSOC SG’s office. Based on the proven positive impact of this capability, and due to the AF
psychologist shortage, AFSOC has moved SOF Psychologists (SOFPSYs) to higher prioritized
need areas/units. AFSOC and the USAF also understand the need to expand this proven
capability when resources permit. Currently, there are several psychologists assigned to AFSOC
operational units. Typically the duties of SMU psychologists do not include patient care in
medical settings. However, it is within their realm of responsibility to ensure that, when needed,
their unit members with personal or family mental health needs are referred to the appropriate
Military Treatment Facility (MTF) or civilian provider resources.

2.3. Mission Description. SOF Operational Psychology includes the use of psychological
principles and skills to improve commander’s decision-making as it pertains to conducting
combat and/or related operations. More specifically, SOF Operational Psychology includes the
following SOF enabling tasks (See MISCAP in Attachment 2):

   a.   Unit/member performance enhancement
   b.   Unit climate assessment and recommendations
   c.   Post-mishap/combat debriefing and RTD consultation
   d.   Aircraft and incident mishap investigation
   e.   Program management on selective manning issues
   f.   Development and oversight of special training
   g.   Management of Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) resistance training
   h.   Personnel assessment and selection for special duty
   i.   Personnel recovery (PR) - repatriation/reintegration
   j.   Information Operations (IO) and MISO
   k.   Interrogation/detention facility support and consultation
   l.   Adversary profiling and targeting
   m.   HUMINT source assessment and intelligence debriefing support
   n.   Human factors consultation to mission design




                                                                                                 4
2.4. Operations/Capability.

   2.4.1. USAF SOFPSY, UTC FFQE7, is the primary deployable element and core of
   AFSOC’s SOF Operational Psychology capability. The SOFPSY UTC is ideally suited to
   SOF mission support. The SOFPSY is an Aviation Psychologist (AFSC 42P3D) with post-
   doctoral training in aeromedical consultation, human factors, aircrew and special mission
   unit assessment/selection, and SERE Level-C training with JPRA SERE certification. They
   ensure appropriate aeromedical disposition for aircrew or other special duty personnel
   experiencing stress related reactions, but do not typically assess or treat mental health
   conditions.

   2.4.2. Most services provided by SOFPSYs fall into the categories of consultation and
   training and are consequently not considered clinical treatment interventions. When
   members require clinical treatment services, the SOFPSY primary serves as a liaison
   between commanders, unit personnel, and the appropriate medical service provider.
   Typically, SOFPSYs will refer individuals needing clinical mental health evaluation and/or
   treatment to a MTF. On some occasions, it may be appropriate for the SOFPSY to
   personally provide clinical evaluations/treatment. When providing such care, the SOFPSY
   should, as closely as possible, adhere to the requirements and policies of the host MTF. It is
   for this reason that SOFPSYs will maintain active credentials at the host MTF.
   Consequently, the SOFPSY will work with the host MTF to provide services sufficient to
   maintain privileges. When performing interrogation/detention consultation or other non-
   medical operational support activities, SOFPSYs will comply with Air Force and Department
   of Defense policies regarding the role of a combatant during the deployment, which is
   distinct from the role of a healthcare provider in a non-combatant role.




                                                                                                5

          COMMAND AND CONTROL (C2) RELATIONSHIPS STRUCTURE

3.1. Command Relationship. SOFPSYs typically deploy as a member of the Joint Special
Operations Task Force (JSOTF) Commander’s special staff. Given the nature of both their in-
garrison and deployed activities, they are not typically assigned to the deployed Command
Surgeon but rather the deployed Commander directly. This facilitates better overall visibility
across Task Force dimensions and personnel, enhances the SOFPSYs ability to lend expertise to
the operational command elements, and clearly separates the conflicting roles of combatant vs.
non-combatant, operational support vs. healthcare service support. This C2 relationship helps to
de-stigmatize psychological consultations by emphasizing their operational focus and avoiding
any possible psychopathological focus.




                                                                                               6
                                            Chapter 4

    INTELLIGENCE, REPATRIATION, REINTEGRATION AND INFORMATION
                           OPERATIONS

4.1. SOFPSYs play a significant role in support of intelligence collection, analysis, and fusion.

   4.1.1. As information emerges, SOF Operational Psychologists integrate with intelligence
   analysts to consolidate information into actionable intelligence fed to targeting boards and
   operational planners

4.2. Repatriation/Reintegration. SOFPSYs are SERE certified. SERE psychologists typically
work with isolated personnel, Prisoners of War (POWs), or hostages through a process called
repatriation and/or reintegration. The primary goals of this process upon return of such an
individual are to gather vital information of intelligence value and enhance reintegration for
RTD. SOF Operational Psychologists are trained to facilitate intelligence and SERE debriefings
of repatriated individuals. In the SERE role, SOFPSYs provide consultation to commanders and
returned personnel on issues related to RTD status. Furthermore, most SOFPSYs are also
Resistance Training (RT) qualified to assist Personnel Recovery exercises and oversee the
operational risk management elements of SERE resistance training laboratories.

4.3. Information Operations. SOFPSYs play a significant role in IO. Often referred to as
MISO, IO relates to the use of various forms of media to distribute a given message of influence.
IO includes five core capabilities: electronic warfare, computer network operations, operations
security, military deception, and MISO. SOF Operational Psychologists often have a significant
part to play in the last two of these five capabilities (military deception and MISO). Operational
psychologists are often members of Joint Planning Groups (JPGs) or intelligence fusion cells,
assisting in the design of effective influence operations. Working alongside intelligence officers
and MISO planners, the SOFPSY provides analysis and recommendations that range from the
tactical to the strategic level.




                                                                                                    7
                                            Chapter 5

                                 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

5.1. Access to Secure Systems. SOFPSYs require minimal communications/computer support.
However, SOFPSYs will require access and use of computer systems (including secure means to
communicate).

5.2. Line Integration/Interoperability/SOFPSY CONOPS and Acceptance. SOFPSYs are
not a new concept and their presence is common within the Army, Navy, and Joint Special
Operations Commands (USASOC, NAVSPECWAR, and JSOC). SOF Operational Psychology
is relatively new among USAF communities, although AFSOC first implemented the concept
over 15 years ago. As a result, joint special operations forces and Special Forces communities
tend to be more comfortable and familiar with the presence of SOF Operational Psychologists.
Although there is growing awareness of SOFPSY capability among conventional forces, greater
interoperability remains among SOF communities.

5.3. Security, Classified, and Sensitive Information Requirements. SOFPSYs require a Top
Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) security clearance and access to
SPECAT programs due to the nature of their work and work products. For example, access to
information regarding adversary capability and activities is necessary to facilitate profiling and
targeting. Information regarding operational elements is needed to assist in performance
enhancement, selection of personnel, and psychological support and debriefing. Access is
typically required in performing SOF Operational Psychology duties (in-garrison and deployed).
SOFPSYs will also need access to a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) in
order to access these systems.

5.4. Logistics Support. Logistics objectives are to reduce the physical footprint and airlift
requirement without degrading capability, and to provide the right materiel and a tailored
logistics support system to ensure responsive sustainment. SOFPSY is lean and requires very
little equipment (e.g., laptop computer configured for Secret-level work with access to the Secret
Internet Protocol (SIPRNET) and Secret-level SPECAT computer systems, psychological
instruments, and personal gear).




                                                                                                 8

                                           TRAINING

6.1. Required Training and Education. All SOFPSYs have specialized training and education
that prepare them for their duties.

   6.1.1. Doctoral degree in clinical or counseling psychology.

   6.1.2. Post-doctoral training and experience qualifying them as Air Force Specialty Code
    (AFSC) 42P3D (Aviation Psychologists).

   6.1.3. SERE certification through the JPRA with level-C SERE training, many also retaining
    RT qualifications for SERE resistance training laboratory oversight.

   6.1.4. Completion of both USAF and USA aviation psychology training (USAFSAM’s
    Air Force’s Aviation Mishap Intervention and Prevention course and USASAM’s
    Aeromedical Psychology Training Course).

   6.1.5. Training in critical incident/traumatic stress response.

   6.1.6. Experience and training in special mission personnel selection.

   6.1.7. Experience and training in adversary profiling and indirect assessment.

   6.1.8. Training in oversight via the U.S. Army's Behavioral Science Consultation Training
    course at Ft. Huachuca.

6.2. Recommended Training and Education. Completion of the SERE 260 Joint SERE
Instructor course, and training as a hostage negotiations consultant, and IO planner is desirable.
Completion of various Joint Special Operations University (JSOU) and USAF Special
Operations School (USAFSOS) courses is recommended. SOFPSYs typically maintain aircrew
block training as operational support flyers to AFSOC aviation units.

6.3. AFMS Medical Training. Air Force operational psychologists maintain clinical currency,
unrestricted, independent license to practice clinical psychology, and specialty credentials IAW
AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Program Management, AFI 44-119, Medical Quality
Operations, AFSOCI 48-101, Aeromedical Special Operations and USSOCOM Directive 350-
29, Special Operations Forces Medical Training.

6.4. UTC-Specific Training. Personnel assigned to SOF Psychologist UTCs FFQE7 have
additional training requirements IAW AFSOCI 48-101 that address mission capabilities and
complete familiarity with UTC mission capability statement.

6.5. Operational Training. AFSOC medical personnel are expected to operate effectively
across a variety of austere, far-forward scenarios as well as in the airborne environment on
AFSOC and other opportune SOF aircraft. The requirements for training include advanced

                                                                                                     9
survival training, advanced weapons training, night operations training, small unit tactics, aircraft
emergency procedures, egress training and use of aircraft emergency equipment. Additionally,
AFSOC medical personnel must be trained to meet USSOCOM interoperability requirements.
For additional operational training requirements, refer to AFSOCI 48-101.

6.6. Credentials. SOF Operational Psychologists must fulfill all medical
credentialing/certification requirements IAW AFI 44-119/AFSOCI 48-101/other applicable
polices/directives/home station medical group requirements.

                                      SUMMARY

7.1. SOFPSY AFTTP Summary. SOFPSY concerns the use of psychological principles and
skills to improve a commander’s decision making as it pertains to conducting combat and/or
related operations. SOFPSYs typically deploy as a member of the JSOTF Commander’s special
staff and fall under the SOG when in-garrison. They provide a wide range of psychological
capability that is non-healthcare oriented, and therefore SOFPSY are often considered
combatants when deployed. SOFPSYs are a proven concept among SOF communities. They are
lean force multipliers and SOF enablers who bring a unique capability to the Overseas
Contingencies Operations (OCO).
