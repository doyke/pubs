This manual prescribes guidance and procedures applicable to Air Force Reports of Surveys
(ROS) Program, the processing of ROS, and processing DD Form 200, Financial Liability
Investigation of Property Loss. It implements AFPD 23-2, Supplies and Materiel Management,
AFI 23-111, Management of Government Property In Possession of the Air Force, Department
of Defense Directive 7200.11, Liability for Government Property Lost, Damaged, or Destroyed,
and DoD 7000.14-R, DoD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 12, Chapter 7, Financial
Liability for Government Property Lost, Damaged, or Destroyed (to be published). ROSs will
be required for all property losses more than $500. "Simple" negligence standard on vehicles
that are damaged, lost, or destroyed has been changed to a "gross" negligence standard. No
ROSs will be required unless there is evidence of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or
deliberate unauthorized use, or if property records must be adjusted. Recommendations for
changes will be sent through channels to HQ USAF/LGSP; however, the originator will forward
an information copy directly to HQ USAF/LGSP, 1030 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC
20330-1030.

                                              Chapter 1

                                        INTRODUCTION

1.1. Statutory Authority.
     1.1.1. Statutory authority governing the accounting for government property lost, damaged,
     or destroyed and the fixing of responsibility and liability through the Report of Survey (ROS)
     system is found in various United States Statutes. This authority includes but is not limited
     to:
        •    Title 10, United States Code (U.S.C.), Sections 2775, 9832, and 9835.
        •    Title 32, U.S.C. Section 710.
        •    Title 37, U.S.C. Section 1007(e).
     1.1.2. Statutes pertaining to the collection of administratively established debts, such as
     liability for the loss, damage, or destruction of government property, include, but are not
     limited to:
        •    Title 5, U.S.C. Section 5514.
        •    Title 10, U.S.C. Section 2775.
        •    Title 31, U.S.C. Section 3716.
        •    Title 37, U.S.C. Section 1007(c) through (e).
1.2. Basic DoD Publications. This manual prescribes the guidance, principles, standards, and
procedures applicable to cases where Air Force property is lost, damaged, or destroyed. It is
based on the following Department of Defense (DoD) publications:
     1.2.1. DoD Directive (DoDD) 7200.11, Liability for Government Property Lost, Damaged,
     or Destroyed, October 26, 1993.
     1.2.2. DoD Regulation (DoDR) 7000.14-R, DoD Financial Management Regulation,
     Volume 12, Chapter 7 (to be published).
1.3. Applicability. This manual applies to all Air Force activities including the Air National
Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve (AFRES). This manual does not apply to nonappropriated
fund (NAF) activities except in specified situations.
1.4. Overall Guidance.
     1.4.1. Commanders are responsible for government real and personal property under their
     control.
     1.4.2. Air Force, AFRES, and ANG, personnel (including civilian employees, Air Force
     Reserve technicians, and ANG technicians) are responsible for the proper care and
     safekeeping of Air Force property regardless of whether or not it is on property records.
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                         9


   1.4.3. Air Force members and employees can be held financially liable for the loss, damage,
   or destruction of Air Force property proximately caused by their negligence, willful
   misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use.
   1.4.4. Financial liability against an individual(s) will be assessed only after an official
   investigation has been conducted specifically for the purpose of determining the facts and the
   circumstances related to the loss, damage, or destruction of the property.
1.5. Assessing Financial Liability.
   1.5.1. Paragraph 4 of the DoDD cited in paragraph 1.2.1 states that financial liability shall be
   assessed be as follows:
       “a. Personal Arms or Equipment. The full amount of the loss or damage to personal as
or equipment.
      “b. Items of Military Supply. The full amount of damage to, or the value of, lost or
damaged items of military supply.
       “c. Government Housing. The full amount of loss or damage to Government housing,
equipment and furnishings therein, if the loss, damage, or destruction was proximately caused by
gross negligence or abuse by the military member, dependent, or guest.
       “d. Other. In all other cases, up to the full amount of the loss, damage, or destruction of
Government property or housing, but in no case more than I month's regular military
compensation as defined in 37 U.S.C. 101(25) in the case of military members and one-twelfth
of annual pay in the case of civilian employees. For Reserve component personnel, one month's
regular military compensation refers to the amount that would be received by the Service
member if on active duty.”
1.6. Attachments. This manual has six attachments:
   1.6.1. Attachment 2 through Attachment 5 are sample memoranda. They may be
   "tailored" to fit the case being processed. They are written for people who still are working
   for the Air Force, therefore, they may require changing if sent to people who have been
   separated and the Air Force is still attempting to be reimbursed. This is especially true if the
   address of the person may have changed. The ROS program manager must decide what
   changes should be made in these sample memoranda.
   1.6.2. A reasonable effort shall be made to obtain payment from a separated member;
   however, if correspondence is returned by the post office indicating that it cannot locate the
   addressee, the approving authority may close the case and forward it to the Financial
   Services Officer (FSO) for continuation of the collection effort. This should be accomplished
   on or before 90 days of the notification notice (see paragraph 16.2.11).
   1.6.3. When the ROS case is closed, the ROS program manager must have the original copy
   of the ROS in the program manager's file. If there is any possibility that the original copy
   will not be returned, the program manager will send a copy of the original ROS. This does
   not apply to routing the ROS to personnel involved in the investigation, review, approval, or
   appeals process.
1.7. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) This supplement includes sample formats for appointment letter,
an investigation questionnaire, and research forms.

                                           Chapter 2

                                           GENERAL

2.1. The Air Force Report of Survey (ROS) Program. The program is based on the DoD
references cited in paragraph 1.2. The term ROS is used interchangeably throughout this manual
in referring to the ROS program, procedures for processing a ROS, or the processing of a DD
Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss.
2.2. Purpose. The purpose of the ROS program is contained in paragraphs 070101 and 070202,
DoDR 7000.14-R. See paragraph 1.2.2. The general purposes are:
   2.2.1. Research and investigate the cause of loss, damage, or destruction of property and
   determine if it was attributable to an individual's negligence or abuse.
   2.2.2. Assess monetary liability against individuals who have lost, damaged, or destroyed
   Government property or relieve them from liability if there is no evidence of negligence,
   willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use of the property.
   2.2.3. Provide documentation which can be used to support the adjustment of accountable
   records.
   2.2.4. Provide commanders with case histories which will enable them to take corrective
   action to prevent recurrence of the incident.
2.3. Miscellaneous ROS Guidance and Procedures.
   2.3.1. Disciplinary Action. Assessment of financial liability will not be used instead of,
   or as a form of disciplinary action. Commanders must decide if a case warrants taking
   disciplinary action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). This is a separate
   action and is not related to the assessment or non-assessment of financial liability. Also,
   commanders are encouraged to use administrative actions when assessment of financial
   liability by ROS is not practical or desirable. These measures could include counseling, oral
   or written reprimands, appropriate remarks in performance evaluations, service to the
   installation or the community, or possibly non-judicial punishment under Article 15 of the
   UCMJ.
   2.3.2. Jointly Operated Activities. If an installation or activity is operated jointly by the Air
   Force and Army or Navy, the Service component possessing the lost or damaged property is
   responsible for processing a ROS according to its manuals, regardless of which Service
   commands the installation.
   2.3.3. Administration of Oaths. Any Air Force officer appointed to survey property, or the
   recorder or presiding officer of any board appointed for such purpose, has the same authority
   to administer oaths or take depositions as officers authorized to do so by the Manual for
   Courts-Martial (1994 Edition), Appendix 2, Article 136 (Authority to Administer oaths and
   to act as notary).
   2.3.4. Communication Security Equipment and Supply Items. ROS initiating officials are
   responsible for notifying the local COMSEC custodian when ROS involves the loss of
   COMSEC equipment and supply items.
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                         11


  2.3.5. Penalizing Units Whose Members Abuse Property. When circumstances warrant,
  commanders should consider withdrawing funds from abusing units and transferring them to
  units that have to repair the items. An example of this might be repair of damaged vehicles.
  2.3.6. Members' Liability. All Air Force members and employees can be held liable for the
  loss, damage, or destruction of government property proximately caused by their negligence,
  willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use. Liability is based upon the preponderance
  of the evidence. That is, financial liability cannot be assessed unless, after considering all
  relevant factors, it appears more likely than not that an individual's actions, or failure to act,
  constituted negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use, and proximately
  caused the loss, damage, or destruction at issue. If the weight of the evidence does not
  support either side, an individual is not held liable. Except for certain instances described in
  the following paragraphs, liability is limited to one month's basic pay in effect at the time the
  loss or damage occurred. THIS PARAGRAPH DOES NOT APPLY TO THE LOSS,
  DAMAGE OR, DESTRUCTION OF VEHICLES. SEE Chapter 18 FOR GUIDANCE
  AND PROCEDURES PERTAINING TO VEHICLES.
  2.3.7. ROS for ANG/AGR Personnel. Chapter 22 contains procedures for ANG/AGR
  personnel who lose, damage, or destroy ANG property. ROS involving ANG/AGR
  personnel are processed as if they were regular Air Force members. ANG/AGR personnel
  who are found to be pecuniary liable may be assessed liability up to one months basic pay,
  regardless of the actual pay received by the member during a particular month.
  2.3.8. Interest, Penalty, and Administrative Charges. Applicable ROS statutes and DoD
  implementing policy explicitly fixed the charges that apply to ROS debts. Therefore, interest,
  penalty, and administrative charges are not assessed by ROS officials.
  2.3.9. Property Not on Property Records. Government property which is not carried on the
  property records should not be recorded simply to initiate a ROS. A survey can be initiated
  without this and action will be taken to obtain reimbursement for any government property
  lost, damaged, or destroyed regardless of whether or not it is considered as "Accountable"
  property. This is particularly relevant considering the large number of local purchase items
  that have been deleted from accountable records.
  2.3.10. Collection Guidance. An Air Force member's or employee's consent is not required
  for collection of ROS debts. The organization responsible for paying the member or
  employee shall determine the maximum amount to be collected each month. Specific
  collection procedures are in Chapter 16. Overall Air Force policies on debt collection are in
  DoDR 7000-14R, Volume 1 and 5.
  2.3.11. Waiver Provisions - Housing Damage. 10 U.S.C. Section 2775 provides for waiver
  of liability arising under conditions pertaining to both family housing and unaccompanied
  personnel housing. The Secretary of the Air Force or designee may waive an uncollected
  claim of the United States, based upon the unique circumstances of an individual case and
  determines that the waiver of the claim is in the best interests of the United States. This
  authority is delegated to the ROS approving and appellate authorities as designated in this
  manual. Detailed procedures are in Chapter 17.
  2.3.12. Discretionary Limitation of Liability. The ROS approving or appellate authority
  may exercise certain discretion regarding assessments of financial liability as contained in
12                                   AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


  Chapter 8; however, the approving or appellate authority must assess the full amount of loss
  for ROS involving liability of any accountable officer for various types of property and
  personal arms and equipment when:
     2.3.12.1. An accountable officer whose negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate
     unauthorized use of government property proximately causes the loss of, or damage to,
     property under his or her accountability, is liable for the entire amount of the loss to the
     government as computed in accordance with Chapter 15. Liability may not be limited to
     a lesser amount by the approving or appellate authority under paragraph 8.6.
     2.3.12.2. An individual whose negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized
     use proximately causes the loss of, or damage to, personal arms and equipment (also
     known as individual equipment) which were issued for the individual's sole use and care.
     In these cases liability is assessed for the entire amount of the loss of the government as
     computed in accordance with Chapter 15. Liability may not be limited to a lesser
     amount by the approving or appellate authority under paragraph 8.6. Personal arms and
     equipment items are so defined by examining how they are used rather than how they are
     obtained.
  2.3.13. Joint and Several Liability. If the loss, damage, or destruction of government
  property resulted from negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use of two
  or more persons, they are held jointly and severally liable for the amount of the loss to the
  government, up to one month's basic pay.
     2.3.13.1. If, for any reason, collection cannot be made from any person held jointly and
     severally liable, the remaining persons are each still liable for the loss to the government
     up to one month's basic pay, or as specified in paragraphs 2.3.12, 8.6, and Chapter 17.
     2.3.13.2. Because the Air Force cannot collect more than the total amount of the loss to
     the government, the approving authority determines the amount to be collected from each
     person.
  2.3.14. Loss of Public Funds. (See paragraph 3.3.4)
  2.3.15. When financial assessment is recommended, a written legal opinion will be obtained
  before the ROS file is forwarded to the approving authority and an individual is advised that
  financial liability is being assessed. The legal review will be made a part of the ROS file.
  2.3.16. Many items used in the Air Force are no longer on accountable records; however,
  commanders are still responsible for assuring that they are properly maintained. When they
  are no longer required or are usable, they will be reported to accountable officers for
  subsequent turn-in to Defense Logistics Agency property disposal offices.
  2.3.17. There are no legal time limits applicable to initiating a ROS or how rapidly it must
  be completed; however, Air Force desired time-frames are contained in Chapter 5 and
  Chapter 6.
  2.3.18. Subject to the provisions contained in Chapter 3, which indicates when a ROS is
  required, approving authorities may disregard processing a ROS if the value of the loss,
  damage, or destruction of the property is $500 or less. This guidance also applies to family
  housing. See chapter 6, AFI 32-6001, Family Housing Management. This option must be
  tempered by the situation pertaining to each case. This guidance does not preclude
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                      13


  approving authorities or commanders from processing a ROS where the loss, damage or
  destruction is less than $500. THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO VEHICLES - SEE Chapter
  18.
     2.3.18.1. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) For Mobility/IPE gear with a collective value of
     $500 or less in loss, damage, or destruction of the property, a ROS Determination Form
     (Attachment 8) must be completed to determine the necessity for a ROS and for account
     adjustment documentation.
  2.3.19. If a loss occurs in retail supply system stocks or property record items because
  supervisors did not ensure that stocks were not properly inventoried and required transfer
  procedures were not followed upon change of custodians. This may be the basis for finding
  an individual negligent in the performance of assigned duties. (See paragraph 21.4)
  2.3.20. ROS Program Managers are encouraged to utilize automated means of processing
  documents related to the program, including prescribed forms.
     2.3.20.1. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) Digital signatures are acceptable on the DD Form
     200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss.
     2.3.20.2. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) Official statements are acceptable via outlook e-
     mail or on a scanned copy of the AF IMT 1168, Statement of Suspect/Witness/
     Complainant.
  2.3.21. When referring to this manual it should be remembered that while it is applicable to
  all commands of the Air Force, they are not all organized the same and do not have the same
  mission. Further, there are many different accountable officers involved in the ROS process,
  such as the base chief of supply, information systems for automatic data processing
  equipment, medical supply, commissary, morale and welfare, and the civil engineer housing
  officer. As a result, individual base implementing procedures may vary from command to
  command and from base to base. Except where specific standards or requirements are
  prescribed, variations are acceptable as long as they comply with the spirit and intent of this
  manual.
  2.3.22. One of the objectives of the ROS program is to point up materiel management
  weaknesses. Block 10 of the DD Form 200 addresses actions to prevent recurrence. AFI 23-
  111, Management of Government Property in Possession of the Air Force (formerly AFR 20-
  14) should be referred to regarding responsibility for Government property.
  2.3.23. Disposition of Funds Received From the ROS Program. Paragraph 16.2.13
  addresses what monies are returned to Air Force operation and maintenance (O&M) accounts
  and which are returned to miscellaneous receipts of the US Treasury. These procedures are
  based on US statutes.
  2.3.24. This manual uses two new terms applicable to ROS. The first is "ROS program
  manager" in lieu of the prior term of "ROS administrator." This was done to more clearly
  portray the duties that are performed. The second is the term "Financial Services Officer"
  (FSO). This replaces the old term "Finance and Accounting Officer (FAO)."

                                           Chapter 3

           GUIDELINES FOR DETERMINING WHEN A ROS IS REQUIRED

3.1. When a ROS is Mandatory. A ROS is mandatory when: (See paragraph 3.3 for details.)
   3.1.1. Controlled or sensitive items, weapons, or classified items have been damaged, or
   destroyed unless exempted by paragraph 3.2.3, 3.2.10, or 3.2.11 below. These ROSs will be
   processed according to this manual. If the ROS contains classified information, the ROS
   must bear an appropriate Security Classification.
   3.1.2. There is evidence of abuse, gross negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate
   unauthorized use, fraud, theft, or if negligence is suspected in the case of supply system
   stocks or property book items.
   3.1.3. Negligence is evident in the loss of hand tools regardless of dollar value unless
   voluntary monetary reimbursement or replacement in kind is offered and accepted.
   3.1.4. Hand tools or other pilferable items over $100 unit cost or $500 total cost are lost.
   3.1.5. Supply system stock records are adjusted in excess of $2,500 for pilferable items.
   3.1.6. Supply system stock records are adjusted in excess of $16,000 for uncontrolled or
   non-pilferable items.
   3.1.7. Supply system stock record adjustments exceed $50,000.
   3.1.8. Ammunition losses addressed in paragraph 3.46, AFI 21-202, Combat Ammunition
   Systems Procedures, require a ROS. Also see paragraph 3.2.3.
   3.1.9. Bulk petroleum losses exceed authorized allowances.
   3.1.10. The initial investigation does not identify the cause of the discrepancy in the supply
   system or property account and the discrepancy meets the requirement for a ROS.
   3.1.11. Contractor held property is lost, damaged, or destroyed by Air Force military or
   civilian personnel.
   3.1.12. Air Force property is lost or damaged while being carried by a government aircraft or
   vessel.
   3.1.13. Requested by an accountable officer.
   3.1.14. Public funds are lost. See paragraph 3.3.4.
   3.1.15. Items are lost, damaged, or destroyed after they have been removed from an aircraft
   damaged in authorized operations.
   3.1.16. Repetitive cases of loss, damage, or destruction occur, even though any one by itself
   would not warrant the processing of a ROS.
   3.1.17. Air Force property is lost, damaged or destroyed while under the control of a non-
   appropriated fund (NAF) instrumentality; however, coordination with the NAF activity is
   essential because items procured with NAF funds are processed differently than those
   procured with Operations and Maintenance (O&M) funds.
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                        15


   3.1.18. An involuntary payment is to be effected.
   3.1.19. When there is evidence of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate
   unauthorized use pertaining to the loss, damage, or destruction of a government vehicle or
   vehicle property records must be adjusted.
3.2. When a ROS is not Mandatory. A ROS is not required when: (See paragraph 3.3 for
details.)
   3.2.1. An individual voluntarily wishes to pay for property that was lost, damaged, or
   destroyed and the item(s) is not one that requires a ROS and is valued at $500 or less.
   3.2.2. A vehicle accident investigation report indicates that gross negligence, willful
   misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use were not involved and it is not necessary to adjust
   property records.
   3.2.3. Ammunition losses are covered by AFI 21-202, paragraph 3.46. Also see paragraph
   3.1.8.
   3.2.4. Air Force property is damaged from the operation of privately owned vehicles, boats,
   aircraft, or conveyances.
   3.2.5. Property belonging to other DoD activities is lost, damaged, or destroyed by Air Force
   military or civilian personnel.
   3.2.6. Major weapon systems components, and attachments are lost, damaged, or destroyed.
   3.2.7. An item becomes unserviceable due to fair, wear, and tear.
   3.2.8. An item is disassembled for component parts or is salvaged.
   3.2.9. Competent authority authorizes an item be abandoned.
   3.2.10. Loss, damage, or destruction is caused by Acts of God.
   3.2.11. Property is lost in combat operations.
3.3. Detailed Guidance Pertaining to Cases Requiring or Not Requiring a ROS.
   3.3.1. Hand Tools and Other Pilferable Items. When negligence is evident, a ROS is
   required for all tool losses regardless of unit cost; however, one is not required for hand tool
   losses when the unit cost is less than $100, the total cost is $500 or under, and the
   maintenance branch chief responsible for the property determines that no negligence is
   involved. This guidance does not prevent the initiation of a ROS when the loss is less than
   $100/500 and it is apparent that there have been systematic losses of tools over a period of
   time. Voluntary reimbursement or replacement in kind is encouraged and may be accepted
   in lieu of a ROS. This $100/500 limit also applies to other pilferable items.
   3.3.2. Contractor-Held Property. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and the USAF
   supplements govern the accounting for government property lost, damaged, or destroyed
   while in a contractor's possession. If such property is lost, damaged, or destroyed by an Air
   Force member or civilian employee, a ROS is processed under this manual.
   3.3.3. Property Lost or Damaged While on a Government Vessel or Aircraft. Air Force
   property lost or damaged while carried on a government vessel or aircraft requires a ROS
   unless it is evident that there was no negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate
16                                  AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


  unauthorized use. If liability is not evident, either prepare a ROS or use an appropriate
  accountability document per AFMAN 23-110, Volume II, Part Two. The activity maintaining
  the property control or accountability record initiates the ROS.
  3.3.4. Loss of Public Funds. The loss of public funds not included in the accountability of
  an FSO or disbursing officer is subject to a ROS. These funds usually represent undeposited
  sales receipts. When the FSO is accountable for the lost funds, the guidance and procedures
  in AFRs 177-102 and 177-108 apply.
  3.3.5. Air Force Property Used by Nonappropriated Fund Activities. Loss of, or damage to,
  Air Force property under control of nonappropriated fund (NAF) instrumentalities is covered
  in AFI 34-204, chapter 5. NAF employees designated by AFI 34-204 as accountable for Air
  Force property are acting in a capacity similar to those individuals who are designated
  custodians of Equipment Authorization Inventory Data (EAID) equipment on Customer
  Authorization/Custody Receipt Listings (CA/CRL). If Air Force equipment is lost or
  damaged by a NAF employee, a ROS must be initiated. If negligence is evident, liability is
  assessed and collection is pursued by notifying the NAF individual through the employing
  NAF activity. If collection is unsuccessful, the employing NAF activity is requested to
  withhold pay by whatever means are authorized for collection of administratively determined
  debts. Also see paragraph 3.1.18.
  3.3.6. Damage Involving Private Conveyances. Damage to Air Force property resulting
  from operation of privately owned vehicles, boats, airplanes, or other conveyances is not
  generally subject to the ROS process. Claims, or administrative action against responsible
  individuals are usually pursued under AFI 51-502, Personnel and Government Recovery
  Claims, and other publications. If Air Force members or employees are involved, a ROS
  may be prepared instead of asserting a tort claim for the damage to Air Force property.
  These actions must be coordinated with the legal office.
  3.3.7. Loss of Damage Involving Other DoD Property. Loss of, or damage to, property
  owned by DoD components, other than Air Force, is handled under the owning component's
  regulations or interservice support agreements. Air Force members or employees held liable
  for loss of, or damage to, another DoD component's property are subject to ROS procedures
  of the other component. Collection from members is made under provisions of the DoD
  Military Pay and Allowances Entitlements Manual.
  3.3.8. Deployments. A ROS is generally not prepared for loss, damage, or destruction of
  major weapons, such as aircraft and missiles, including components and attached equipment,
  used in authorized operations. Once a deployment is ordered (operational, exercise, or
  training) all vehicles that make up the Augmented Deployable Unit (ADU) in convoy are
  considered an integral part of the weapon system. Therefore, from generation through
  deployment to redeployment and recovery, the entire convoy, except for individual
  equipment, is exempt from ROS procedures; however, this paragraph must be related to
  paragraph 3.3.9.
  3.3.9. Property Lost During Combat Operations. Property lost during, or as a result of
  combat operations is not subject to the provisions of this manual. It is accounted for per
  AFM 67- 1, volume 1, part one, chapters 10 and 11.
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                     17


  3.3.10. Equipment Items. A ROS is not required for nonexpendable items listed on AF
  Form 2691, Aircraft/Missile Equipment Property Record, when these items are lost in
  aircraft accidents occurring under the circumstances in paragraph 3.3.9 above.
  3.3.11. A ROS is not required for other than AF Form 2691 equipment lost in aircraft
  accidents occurring under the circumstances in paragraph 3.3.8. The aircraft termination
  message or any document signed by a commander indicating that the items were lost in the
  accident can be used to adjust the appropriate property record.
  3.3.12. A ROS is not required when loss, damage, or destruction was incident to the
  following circumstances:
     3.3.12.1. Authorized flight, takeoff, landing, taxiing, or ground handling by the pilot,
     copilot, other crew members, or authorized ground personnel. (Ground handling includes
     refueling, servicing, loading, and unloading. authorized ground personnel includes
     maintenance personnel.)
     3.3.12.2. Unserviceability due to fair wear and tear.
     3.3.12.3. Disassembly for recovery of component parts or salvage authorized by
     competent authority.
     3.3.12.4. Abandonment resulting from an accident incident to authorized operations.
     3.3.12.5. Act of God.
  3.3.13. Exceptions to paragraph 3.3.12.
     3.3.13.1. A ROS is required for aircraft partially damaged and unserviceable, damaged
     beyond economical repair, abandoned, or destroyed under circumstances other than those
     described in paragraph 3.3.12.
     3.3.13.2. A ROS is required for repair cycle assets and AF Form 2691 items if they are
     damaged or lost after removal from an aircraft. Note: An aircraft may have been
     damaged incident to authorized operations, but once accountable items are removed, they
     are subject to similar accountability and standard of care as other property book items. If
     these items are lost or damaged after removal from the damaged aircraft, this could not be
     construed as loss of damage incident to authorized ground handling, and a ROS will be
     initiated.

        GENERAL PROCEDURES FOR PROCESSING A ROS (DD FORM 200)

4.1. General Overview of ROS Processing Procedures. Detailed procedures are in other parts
of this manual.
   4.1.1. When property is lost, damaged, or destroyed by an individual or an organization, the
   organization that has possession of the property will initiate the ROS and that unit
   commander, or in some cases the appointing authority, will appoint an investigating officer
   who will determine the facts in the case. The ROS Program Manager will be advised
   promptly so that a ROS number can be assigned.
   4.1.2. The investigating officer must be "disinterested" and have no interest in the
   custodianship, care, accountability, or safekeeping of the property. Further, when
   appointed as investigating officer, the completion of the investigation becomes a
   primary duty and the officer will be relieved of other duties or assignments that would
   interfere with the investigation.
   4.1.3. The investigating officer (the term "officer" applies to anyone appointed to investigate
   the case), at a minimum, will answer the six questions outlined in para 070203, reference
   1.2.2. These are: what happened, how, where, and when; who was involved, and was there
   any evidence of negligence, misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use or disposition of the
   property.
   4.1.4. The investigating officer, based on the facts, makes findings and recommendations on
   the issue of liability of the person(s) involved.
   4.1.5. The next step is to refer the ROS to the accountable officer so that the records may be
   adjusted. Note that this action will not be affected by the action taken by the approving or
   appellate authority; therefore, the accountable records are adjusted as soon as possible.
   4.1.6. Next, the investigating officer allows the person(s) involved to review the case and
   provide verbal or written information to refute the findings and recommendations.
   4.1.7. The ROS is then processed to the appointing authority for assignment of financial
   responsibility against the individual(s) charged or relieving them from responsibility. If
   financial responsibility is to be assessed, the ROS will be referred to the legal office for
   review. If the investigating officer has not performed a thorough job, the ROS should be
   returned for reaccomplishment.
   4.1.8. In some cases the appointing authority may appoint a financial liability officer to re-
   investigate the case. This is a second investigation and is performed when it is necessary to
   reevaluate the initial investigation or because of the complicated nature of the case. In most
   cases, a financial liability officer should not be required if the investigating officer
   accomplishes a proper investigation.
   4.1.9. In unusual cases, the approving authority may appoint a financial liability board to
   evaluate the findings of the appointing authority and the financial liability officer.
   4.1.10. Upon conclusion of these actions, the approving authority reviews the ROS and
   assigns financial responsibility or relieves the individual(s) of responsibility.
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                19


  4.1.11. At this time the ROS is submitted for acknowledgment by the individual(s) charged
  who are advised that the ROS action may be appealed to the next level in the chain of
  command above the person who assigned the financial liability assessment.

                        TIME FRAMES FOR PROCESSING A ROS

5.1. DoD Guidance. Para A.6., 070301 of reference 1.2.2. allows the Services to set processing
time limits.
5.2. ROS Must Be Acted on Expeditiously. Processing time limits are outlined below. They
are mandatory for Active Air Force units. ANG and AFRES units are encouraged to adhere to
them if feasible; however, because ANG and AFRES units train on weekends, extended time
frames have been established to meet the administrative requirements of these organizations.
The program manger, acting for the approving authority, is responsible to ensure that they are
met. If circumstances preclude adherence to these time limits, this information must be provided
to the ROS program manager so that the ROS file can be properly annotated.
5.3. Active Air Force Processing Times.
   5.3.1. Fifteen days from the date of the discovery of the loss, the organization will complete
   the preliminary investigation phase - blocks 1 through 8. This includes obtaining a ROS
   Investigation Number and appointing an investigating officer.
       5.3.1.1. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) Unit/Custodians will complete one of the following
       research forms prior to ROS initiation:
           5.3.1.1.1. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) Lost              Equipment       Research      Checklist
           (Attachment 8)
           5.3.1.1.2. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) FOB COMSEC (Attachment 9)
           5.3.1.1.3. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) Mobility/IPE < $500 (Attachment 10)
           5.3.1.1.4. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) MDG Lost Equipment (Attachment 11)
           5.3.1.1.5. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) Damaged Vehicle (Attachment 12)
       5.3.1.2. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) Research form will be reviewed by Unit (CC) and
       Unit ROSM and an Investigating Officer (IO) will be appointed if applicable.
       5.3.1.3. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) ROS opened upon submission of research form to
       appropriate ROSM.
   5.3.2. Thirty days for the investigating officer and the responsible officer to complete the
   initiation phase - blocks 9 through 12 and return the ROS to the ROS program manager. This
   includes interviewing all persons involved in the case. A detailed list of investigators duties
   are contained in Chapter 7. These times assume that the person(s) that may be held liable
   are located on the same base as the investigator. If it is necessary to obtain statements by
   mail, these times are additive to the 30 days; however, it is not feasible to indicate the time
   required to obtain mailed testimony.
       5.3.2.1. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) IO investigation and Unit/CC review must be completed
       in 14 days or less. Extensions granted by ROSM on a case-by-case basis. The IO
       investigation should focus specifically on the presence or absence of negligence. Case files
       will be located on Sharepoint (https://ice.usafe.af.mil/sites/86LRG/ROS6/default.aspx)
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                         21


      and contain all necessary documents to complete investigation. Completed investigations can
      be submitted via e-mail.
   5.3.3. Five days for the ROS program manager to send the ROS to the accountable officer
   for the adjustment of property records and to send a copy of the ROS file to person(s) who
   may be held liable based on the investigators findings and recommendations (Attachment 2
   and Attachment 3).
      5.3.3.1. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) Five days for ROSM review.
      5.3.3.2. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) Seven days for Accountable Officer for adjustment
      of property records.
   5.3.4. Forty days - 30 days for the person(s) who may be held liable to respond to
   Attachment 2 or Attachment 3 (Intent Notifications) plus 10 days mailing times from and
   to the program manager.
   5.3.5. Five days for the appointing authority to review the file and pass it to the approving
   authority.
      5.3.5.1. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) Seven days for Appointing Authority review.
   5.3.6. Thirty days if the appointing authority requires a review by a financial liability officer
   or board.
   5.3.7. Twenty days for a legal review if financial liability is recommended.
   5.3.8. Five days for the approving official to approve the findings and recommendations.
      5.3.8.1. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) (Added) Seven days for Approving Official review.
   5.3.9. Total time to complete the ROS - 100 days if there is no assessment of financial
   liability, 130 days if a financial liability officer or board is appointed, and 150 days if
   financial liability is recommended because a legal review is required.
5.4. ANG and AFRES Processing Times.
   5.4.1. Forty five days to complete blocks I through 8.
   5.4.2. One hundred days to complete blocks 9 through 12, 16, and 17.
   5.4.3. Total time to complete the ROS - 145 days if no financial liability is assessed. Add 40
   days if a legal review is required (total 185 days) and another 60 days if a financial liability
   officer or boards is appointed (total 245 days).

                                            Chapter 6

       TIME LIMITS FOR ACTIONS REQUIRED AFTER APPROVAL OF A ROS

6.1. General. This chapter outlines actions that must be taken after the approving authority
assesses liability against a person(s) or received a request for reconsideration, appeal, or waiver.
Chapter 16 outlines the details involved in voluntary payments, collections, and refunds.
   6.1.1. Within five workdays of the approval authority assessing financial liability, the
   program manager will advise the individual found liable if located on the same base.If the
   approving authority is at different location from the person found liable, 12 work days is
   allowed for mail notification within the CONUS; however, this target maybe extended by the
   program manager to fit mail schedules, especially if remote overseas locations are involved.
   Sample memoranda sent to the person(s) found financially liable are at Attachment 4 for
   Non-Government Housing Damage and Attachment 5 for Government Housing Damage.
   6.1.2. Concurrently with the actions in paragraph 6.1.1, the program manager will advise the
   FSO to record the debt on the member's pay record. Involuntary collection may not begin
   until the expiration of 30 days from the date that the individual receives notification of
   liability. Within five work days after the expiration date, the program manager will advise
   the FSO to initiate involuntary collection if no reply has been received from the individual.
   6.1.3. Within 30 days of being notified of financial liability, the individual(s) may:
   voluntarily pay the amount assessed or appeal the assessment to the approving authority if
   the dollar amount is one month's pay or less; however, if the assessment exceeds one month's
   pay, the individual must notify the approving authority of the intent to appeal the assessment.
   The appeal must be submitted within 60 days of the date that the notification was received.
   6.1.4. If an appeal is received within the allowed time, the FSO is advised immediately not
   to collect the debt until the appeal is ruled upon by the approving authority.
   6.1.5. If the debt exceeds one month's pay and the individual indicates that an appeal will be
   made, the FSO is advised to suspend collection for 60 days plus mailing times. If no appeal is
   received within 60 days plus mailing time, the FSO is notified to begin involuntary
   collection. If the appeal is received within the allowed time, the FSO is notified immediately
   to suspend collection until the approving authority rules on the appeal.
   6.1.6. Within 10 days of action on the appeal, the program manager advises the FSO to close
   out the collection action and also advises the individual(s) if the appeal is approved. If the
   appeal is disapproved, the FSO is advised to place the debt collection in suspense pending
   action by the next higher headquarters and advises the individual(s) that the appeal request
   will be forwarded to the next higher headquarters for action.
   6.1.7. Times authorized headquarters above wing level to act on requests for
   reconsiderations, appeals, or waivers are as follows: The next higher headquarters will act on
   a ROS within 30 days after receipt. MAJCOMs will act on a ROS within 60 days of receipt
   and HQ USAF will act on a ROS within 90 days of receipt.
   6.1.8. Forty-two days, including 12 for mailing, are allowed for an individual transferred to
   another CONUS base to respond to the proposed assessment of financial liability by the
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                 23


  former base. If a response is not received by day 42, the program manager will forward the
  case to the FSO for collection.
  6.1.9. Creditor organizations are allowed 45 days to complete due process procedures
  against civilian employees. After this date the program manager will follow up every 30
  days until the case is returned for involuntary collection (see paragraph 16.2.4).
  6.1.10. Within 15 days of receipt of a ruling from a headquarters above wing level

                                          Chapter 7

           INVESTIGATING OFFICER - RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES

7.1. General. The commander to whom the lost, damaged, or destroyed property was issued
normally will appoint an official who will determine the facts in the case and make findings and
recommendations as to assessing or not assessing pecuniary liability against an individual.
   7.1.1. The investigating official will be an officer, non-commissioned officer (E-7 or above),
   or civilian employee in grades GS-7, WG-9, WL-5 or WS-1 or above. If feasible, the
   investigator will be senior in rank to the person(s) being investigated and be from a unit
   different from the one involved in the ROS. When the investigating "officer" is not senior in
   rank or grade to the individual being investigated, the person who appointed the
   investigating officer will advise the appointing authority in writing as to why this was
   necessary. This document will be made a part of the ROS file as an exhibit.
   7.1.2. The investigator must be a disinterested, impartial individual who has no interest
   or involvement in the custodianship, care, accountability, or safe keeping of the
   property in question.
7.2. General Duties of Investigators. The investigator will become familiar with this manual
and the requirements for making an investigation.
   7.2.1. Paragraph 4.1.3 outlines the six basic DoD requirements for conducting an
   investigation.
   7.2.2. In addition to the DoD requirements, when applicable, the investigator will:
       7.2.2.1. Review and evaluate as a minimum the adequacy of existing procedures to
       protect property.
       7.2.2.2. Determine compliance with existing procedures and directives.
       7.2.2.3. Determine the individuals responsible and the type of responsibility assigned
       (such as command, supervisory, or personal).
       7.2.2.4. Present facts indicating whether or not negligence or abuse was involved.
       7.2.2.5. Determine the proximate cause of the loss, damage, or destruction.
       7.2.2.6. Recommend corrective action to minimize or preclude recurrence.
       7.2.2.7. Establish when it was first determined that the property was lost or damaged.
       7.2.2.8. Determine if the custodian(s) performed their duties properly. (See Chapter
       21.)
       7.2.2.9. Determine if the custodians were properly trained.
       7.2.2.10. Determine what actions were taken to find lost property.
       7.2.2.11. If vehicle damage is involved, determine if the operator was properly briefed
       regarding governing directives and if the driver was properly trained.
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                         25


7.3. Investigation is a Primary Duty. Conducting the investigation will be the primary duty of
the investigator until it is completed and blocks 1 through 12 of the ROS (DD Form 200) are
completed. The investigator will be relieved of normal duties which could impair the
expeditious completion of the investigation. See Chapter 5 for allowable ROS processing
times.
7.4. Detailed Investigator Duties. The investigator will comply with the requirements outlined
in paragraph 4.1.4 above, ensure that they are well documented in Block 9 of the DoD Form 200
above, and also will:
   7.4.1. Develop the facts in the case which will logically lead to the findings and
   recommendations(s). The investigator must interview any persons with a knowledge of the
   case if they are in the immediate area. This includes the person(s) who may have lost,
   damaged, or destroyed the property.
   7.4.2. Obtain written statements from persons interviewed. These statements will be sworn
   to in accordance with the Manual For Courts Martial (1984), Appendix 2, Section 936. This
   section authorizes the investigator to swear witnesses.
   7.4.3. Attach witness statements to the ROS. They must substantiate the statements and the
   findings and recommendations of the investigator.
   7.4.4. Ensure that all witnesses are identified by first name, middle initial, last name, rank or
   grade, SSN, organization to which assigned, and if applicable the address of the witnesses.
   7.4.5. Include a statement that will indicate how the witness is (or was) involved in the case
   or how the witness has knowledge of the situation.
   7.4.6. Indicate in block 9 (Circumstances) of the DD Form 200 whether any laws or
   directives or procedures were violated. If the loss relates to the changing of custodians, refer
   to paragraph 21.4 pertaining to the procedures for transferring accounts from one custodian
   to another. Also indicate how the person(s) involved did or did not exercise ordinary or
   reasonable care.
   7.4.7. Attempt to communicate with witnesses not in the immediate area and obtain written
   statements which the witness will certify as being true and correct to the best of the
   knowledge and belief of the witness, or request that the witness prepare a statement and
   swear to it in front of a notary public or military official authorized to administer oaths.
   7.4.8. Submit a written signed statement outlining the information verbally received from the
   witness if the investigator is not able to obtain statements indicated in paragraph 7.4.2 above.
   The statement will contain words to indicate that the statement is a true portrayal of what the
   witness told the investigator and what investigator believes the witness would have stated if a
   written statement had been provided.
   7.4.9. Attach the motor vehicle accident investigation conducted by either military or
   civilian law enforcement officials to the ROS. This must substantiate the investigator's
   statements, findings, and recommendations if a ROS is submitted on the accident. See
   Chapter 18, ROS Pertaining to Vehicles. In general this states that a ROS on vehicles only
   will be prepared if there is evidence of gross negligence, willful misconduct, deliberate
   unauthorized use, or property records must be adjusted.
26                                   AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


  7.4.10. Complete blocks 9 (Circumstances in the case and the investigator's findings and
  recommendations) and 10 (Corrective Actions) on the DD Form 200.
     7.4.10.1. Ensure that the findings and the recommendations are supported by the
     testimony of persons involved and that the testimony leads logically to the findings and
     recommendations. Also see paragraph 14.1.9.
     7.4.10.2. Determine if financial liability should be assessed based strictly on the facts
     and circumstances of the case. If financial liability is recommended, it will be based on
     the value of the property involved. It will not be tempered by the fact that financial
     liability generally is limited to not exceed one month's pay nor by statements made to the
     investigating officer by the person(s) involved that the assessment of financial liability
     will cause personal hardship. Reduction of the recommended assessment of financial
     liability is a command prerogative and not within the purview of the investigating officer.
     7.4.10.3. When the person(s) involved responds to the approving authority's Notification
     of Assessment Of Financial Liability (Attachment 4 or Attachment 5), comments may
     be included regarding the adverse impact that paying the assessed amount will have upon
     the personnel involved.
     7.4.10.4. Complete and sign Block 11, then pass the case to the responsible officer for
     the completion of Block 12.

                                           Chapter 8

    COMMANDER'S RESPONSIBILITIES AND DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITIES

8.1. General. This chapter explains squadron, group, wing/installation, commander's roles
regarding ROS. In some instances in this chapter, the term "wing/installation commander" is
synonymous with squadron or group commanders.
8.2. Guidance.
   8.2.1. The wing/installation commander is designated as the ROS approving authority. The
   installation commander usually is the commander of a wing or air base group but may be the
   commander of a technical training center or similar level organization. The wing or
   installation commander also normally serves as the approving authority for ROS initiated by
   host or tenant units.
   8.2.2. Approving authorities are located at HQ USAF, MAJCOMs, numbered Air Forces.
   technical training centers, wing/installation commanders, and some Field Operating Agencies
   (FOAs) and Direct Reporting Units (DRUs). Wing/installation commanders may designate
   group commanders as ROS approving authorities.
   8.2.3. The wing/installation commander serves as the reviewing authority for ROS initiated
   by Air Force ROTC units. This authority may be delegated to group commanders.
   8.2.4. In unusual circumstances, MAJCOM, numbered Air Force, or wing/installation
   commanders may delegate approving authority in writing to squadron or other unit
   commanders if they are operating at locations or in situations that preclude or make ROS
   processing difficult compared to those encountered at the units home station.
   8.2.5. Exceptions are outlined in paragraph 8.5.
8.3. Responsibilities. Group, wing/installation commanders will:
   8.3.1. Be responsible for accuracy, review, and completeness of ROS originating within their
   approval jurisdiction.
   8.3.2. Ensure all personnel under their command are thoroughly instructed in property
   responsibilities and are constantly alert to guard against loss, damage, or destruction of
   government property.
   8.3.3. Ensure personnel under their command comply with this manual.
   8.3.4. Ensure the assessment of financial liability against an individual is not used instead of
   or as a form of disciplinary action.
   8.3.5. Develop inspection procedures that will ensure that unit commanders document,
   monitor, and take appropriate corrective action pertaining to property loss. damage, or
   destruction cases that occur under unusual or recurring circumstances, regardless of the
   dollar value involved. In addition, loss, damage, or destruction data from units will be
   reviewed to ensure that responsible organizations process ROS when required. As
   appropriate, this information will be forwarded to the ROS program manager for inclusion in
   the manager's trend data.

8.4. Authority To Delegate Responsibility.
   8.4.1. Wing/installation commanders may delegate approving authority in writing to group
   commanders. If group commanders become approving authorities, the wing/installation
   commanders will be the appellate authorities; however, if appeals are disapproved by the
   wing/installation commander, they are forwarded to the next higher commander as indicated
   in paragraph 17.3.
      8.4.1.1. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) Approving Authority responsibilities are delegated
      from 86 AW/CC to 86 MSG/CC for all Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE)
      and Land Mobile Radio (LMR), and to 86 LRG/CC for all other government
      owned/purchased assets, to include CA/CRL, housing, vehicle damage, and assets
      purchased with GPC.
   8.4.2. MAJCOM commanders may delegate to commanders of numbered air forces,
   technical training centers, or similar levels of command, the authority to take final action on
   ROS appeals in cases in which they did not also serve as final approving authority. Further,
   these commanders may delegate authority to take final action on ROS appeals to members of
   their immediate staff, however, these delegations must be in writing.
   8.4.3. The authority to approve ROS for leather flying jackets is not delegated below the
   wing or group commander having command authority over the individual who lost, damaged,
   or destroyed the jacket. They are not included in the $500 rule of no ROS required; however,
   if an individual volunteers to pay for a lost, damaged, or destroyed jacket, a ROS is not
   required.
   8.4.4. Wing/installation commanders may delegate, in writing, the authority for a ROS
   program manager to approve not processing a ROS if the value is under $500 and a ROS is
   not required. The intent of this delegation is to decrease the workload involved in processing
   unnecessary ROS. It is emphasized that this is optional and implementing it may be valid at
   some bases but not at others.
8.5. Exceptions.
   8.5.1. The Commander, HQ USAF Recruiting Service, is the approving authority for ROS
   originating within recruiting command units.
   8.5.2. The Commander, Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), is the
   approving authority for ROS on property for which accountability is maintained centrally at
   HQ AFOSI.
   8.5.3. The Assistant/Deputy Adjutant General - Air is the approving authority for ROS
   involving ANG property.
   8.5.4. The AFROTC region commander, after administrative review by the group,
   wing/installation commander, is the final approving authority for ROS originating within
   AFROTC units.
   8.5.5. The Commander, Joint Communications Support Element (JCSE), is the approving
   authority for ROS originating within this Element.
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                       29


   8.5.6. The Commander, HQ Air Force Space Command, is the approving authority for ROS
   on property for which accountability is maintained centrally at HQ Air Force Space
   Command.
   8.5.7. The Director, Worldwide Automated Law Library Systems, Air Force Legal Services
   Agency is the approving authority for ROS on property for which the accountability is
   maintained centrally by the Director, HQ USAF Legal Services Agency.
8.6. Discretionary Authorities. Commanders and or approving authorities, if they provide
written rationale, may exercise certain discretion regarding assessments of financial liability
based on the following guidance:
   8.6.1. The approving or appellate authority may not limit the amount of liability
   pertaining to accountable officers or individuals who lose, damage, or destroy personal
   arms and equipment based on the conditions outlined in paragraph 2.3.12.
   8.6.2. The approving or appellate authority may waive occupant liability for government
   housing based on the procedures contained in Chapter 17 and Chapter 19.
   8.6.3. In cases involving property other than that related to accountable officers or an
   individuals' personal arms and equipment addressed in paragraph 2.3.12, the approving or
   appellate authority may, within the bounds of reasonableness, fairness, and equity, impose
   financial liability in an amount equal to the amount of the loss or damage (up to one month's
   basic pay), or in some lesser amount deemed appropriate, or relieve an individual from
   liability, based on the circumstances of each case. In determining the amount of financial
   liability, the approving or appellate authority may consider factors including, but not limited
   to:
       8.6.3.1. Degree of abuse or negligence involved.
       8.6.3.2. The extent, if any, to which involuntary collection would cause substantial
       financial hardship, constitute a clear injustice, or adversely impact unit morale and
       discipline.
       8.6.3.3. Available government remedies against other culpable persons, and the relative
       culpability of all persons whose acts or omissions contributed to the damage or loss.
       8.6.3.4. Any prior instances of abusive or negligent conduct toward government
       property.
       8.6.3.5. Degree of risk arising from assigned duties.
       8.6.3.6. Experience and training.
   8.6.4. If more than one individual is held liable on a ROS in which the approving or
   appellate authority is considering reduction of liability under this paragraph, each person is
   held jointly and severally liable for the total of the assessed liability after reduction.
   Although collection from each person may differ, the actual assessment of liability may not
   be apportioned. (See paragraph 2.3.13)

           APPOINTING AUTHORITY - RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES

9.1. Appointment. The appointing authority must be designated in writing by the approving
authority. Normally the approving authority is the wing or installation commander. More than
one appointing authority may be designated.
   9.1.1. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) Appointing Authority responsibilities are delegated from
   86 AW/CC to 86 MSG/CD for ADPE assets and to 86 LRG/CD for all other government
   owned/purchased assets.
9.2. Who Else May be an Appointing Authority. The following are also authorized to serve
as appointing authorities:
   9.2.1. The commander of a MAJCOM or any officer authorized by the commander for ROS
   arising within their command headquarters, if the MAJCOM headquarters is not a tenant on
   the base. If it is a tenant, the wing or installation commander could be the appointing
   authority in addition to having the normally assigned duty of being the approving authority.
   9.2.2. The commander or deputy of a numbered Air Force, technical training center, or other
   headquarters above wing level and wing/installation or group commanders.
   9.2.3. Commanders, or their deputies, of all types of bases and geographically separated
   organizations (GSU) except AFROTC units. For AFROTC units the region commander
   serves as the appointing authority.
   9.2.4. The commanders of USAF Recruiting Groups and HQ AFOSI/FM.
   9.2.5. A person appointed on orders as a member of a financial liability board and who has
   been authorized to act as an appointing authority.
   9.2.6. The commander of an organization above squadron or similar unit level.
   9.2.7. The commander of the next higher echelon of command when one of the above is
   personally accountable or has custodial responsibility for the property being surveyed.
   9.2.8. Approving authorities.
9.3. Responsibilities of Appointing Authorities. The first seven responsibilities listed below
are mandated by DoD in paragraph 070301 B, Reference 1.2.2.; however, some are modified for
Air Force use.
   9.3.1. Appoints a financial liability officer when conditions warrant.
   9.3.2. Appoints a board in lieu of a financial liability officer to conduct the investigation, if
   warranted. Reasons for considering appointment of a board include complexity, size, or
   unique type of loss due to negligence or abuse.
   9.3.3. Provides administrative guidance to financial liability and investigating officers.
   9.3.4. Reviews all ROS, appeals, and waiver requests for accuracy and compliance with this
   manual.
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                       31


   9.3.5. Approves or disapproves the recommendations of the financial liability officer or the
   board, and forwards personal recommendations to the approving authority.
   9.3.6. Takes final action on ROS for normal retail type items used at base level when the
   amount of the loss or damage is less than $2,000 and there is no evidence of negligence,
   willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use if authorized to do so by the approving
   authority.
   9.3.7. Approves or disapproves DD Forms 200 when the gain or loss of inventory in Supply
   System Stocks is less than $100,000 and authorization has been delegated in writing by the
   approving authority.
   9.3.8. Makes recommendations to the approving authority on ROS administrative guidance
   and procedures.
   9.3.9. Examines ROS for unauthorized erasures and alterations, completeness, logical
   conclusions, findings, and recommendations.
   9.3.10. Appoints an investigating officer when the situation warrants. Examples of this are
   when:
      9.3.10.1. When the unit commander determines that it is not feasible to obtain a
      disinterested officer from the unit even though the unit commander normally appoints the
      investigating officer. This can easily occur in cases where property book items are
      involved and the someone in the chief of supply's office may be the custodian and the
      chief of supply the accountable officer. In such cases the unit commander should obtain
      an investigator from an organization not involved in the ROS; however, if this is not
      feasible, the appointing authority will designate an investigating officer from another unit
      to avoid a conflict of interest.
      9.3.10.2. The appointing officer desires to designate investigating officers to ensure that
      there is no conflict of interest and the investigation is conducted in an objective manner
      by an impartial, disinterested investigator from an organization different than the one to
      which the property belonged.
9.4. Appointing Authority Responsibilities to the Investigating Officer. The appointing
authority must:
   9.4.1. In addition to the assistance provided by the ROS program manager, the appointing
   authority may provide additional guidance to the investigating officer by advising how
   thorough the investigation should be and providing advice and help when required or
   requested by the investigating or financial liability officer or the president of the financial
   liability board.
   9.4.2. Review the findings and recommendations to ensure that:
      9.4.2.1. Any contradictions in the ROS are resolved.
      9.4.2.2. The statements of interested persons are confirmed or refuted.
      9.4.2.3. Findings are stated clearly.
      9.4.2.4. Recommendations are sound and are supported by logical conclusions based on
      the facts stated in the findings and there is no apparent or possible conflict of interest.
 32                                   AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


       9.4.2.5. Monetary charges are computed correctly.
       9.4.2.6. The person(s) who may be found financially liable were interviewed by the
       investigating officer and, if one is appointed, by the financial liability officer or
       board.This testimony must become a part of the ROS file and it must be weighed against
       other testimony obtained from other individuals, and used in developing the findings and
       recommendations.
9.5. Other Appointing Authority Responsibilities. The appointing authority must:
   9.5.1. Review the evidence included with the ROS and must screen out unnecessaryevidence
   while ensuring that enough information is there for later reviews. If more evidence is needed
   the ROS is sent back to the initiator or to the investigating officer.
   9.5.2. Ensure that the judge advocate or the legal office perform a legal review of any ROS
   that recommends that a person be held pecuniary liable, that this review is accomplished
   before the approving authority takes final action, and that it is made a part of the ROS file.
   9.5.3. Ensure that all pertinent instructions concerning preparation of ROS were followed
   before it is sent to the approving authority for action.

           APPROVING AUTHORITY - RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES

10.1. DoD Policy Pertaining to Approving Authorities. Paragraphs 070301 and 070302,
reference l.2.2. are quoted below for Air Force compliance.
   10.1.1. Paragraph 070301 (Duties and Responsibilities) reads as follows:
       “A. Approving Authority. DoD Component Regulations shall designate who may be
   an approving authority. The approving authority's responsibilities may be delegated;
   however, the delegations must be in writing. The approving authority also may act as the
   appointing authority or designate an appointing authority in writing. The approving
   authority shall:
              “1. Designate an appointing authority, when needed.
               “2. Disqualify himself or herself when a conflict of interest is possible because
           the loss relates to property for which he or she is responsible and/or accountable.
               “3. Establish procedures and designate a person to initiate and conduct an
           inquiry immediately after the loss, damage, or destruction is discovered. (NOTE:
           Within the Air Force, the unit commander normally designates the investigating
           officer; however, this is in consonance with the DoD guidance, because it is an
           implementing action taken to accomplish the DoD objective).
               “4. Ensure that all DD Forms 200 received are accurate and complete. Evaluate
           each DD Form 200 and either approve recommendations to assess financial liability
           or relieve those involved from liability, responsibility or accountability. The
           approving authority approves or disapproves all DD Forms 200, regardless of dollar
           value, unless otherwise delegated in writing.
              “5. Ensure that all gains and losses that require a formal investigation are
           promptly and thoroughly investigated. The system used to process DD Form 200
           must be frequently reviewed to evaluate the accuracy and timeliness of the
           investigations.
               “6. Ensure that DD Forms 200 are initiated, processed and adjudicated within
           the time limits that may be established by the DoD Components.
               “7. Require, if delays occur in the initiating or processing of a DD Form 200, a
           written explanation of the reason for the delay and take appropriate corrective
           actions.
               “8. Ensure that persons held financially liable are so notified, informed of their
           rights (including waiver rights if Government housing is involved), and given the
           opportunity to inspect and copy the DD Form 200.
              “9. Personally evaluate each DD Form 200 when there is evidence of
           negligence or abuse.
 34                                    AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


              “10. Determine whether to delegate to the appointing authority the authority to
           approve or disapprove a DD Form 200 when there is no evidence of negligence or
           abuse.
               “11. Ensure, when financial liability is recommended, or when
           recommendations appear to be inconsistent with findings, that a judge advocate or
           civilian attorney has reviewed the findings and provided an opinion on the
           adequacy of evidence and its relationship to the finding sand recommendations.
           This legal review shall be included as a part of the record with the DD Form 200
           and completed before final action is taken by the approving authority. initialed and
           documented.
              “12. Ensure that corrections of any attested entries are properly initialed and
           documented.
               “13. Overrule, when appropriate, the recommendations of the appointing
           authority and the financial liability officer. When this action results in the
           assessment of financial liability, the individuals not previously recommended for
           liability shall be advised of their rights and afforded an opportunity to exercise their
           rights.
               “14. Formally notify individuals against whom he or she has approved financial
           liability.”
   10.1.2. Paragraph 070302 Summary reads as follows: “The appointing and approving
   authorities must act on the DD Form 200 once an individual has been properly notified and
   given the opportunity to respond to the findings. Failure of involved individuals to respond
   to recommendations of financial liability is not a sufficient reason to delay the approval
   process if the individuals were given a reasonable opportunity to reply...”
10.2. Air Force Requirements Pertaining to DoD Mandates.
   10.2.1. Delegation of Responsibilities. See Chapter 8.
   10.2.2. Responsibilities. Approving authorities will:
      10.2.2.1. Take action on a ROS when the amount of financial liability to be assessed is
      equal to or less than $10,000. When the amount of financial liability to be assessed is
      greater than $10,000 or when the commander is personally involved, the ROS will be
      forwarded to the next higher command for action.
      10.2.2.2. Take action on ROS for any dollar amount of loss or damage when there is no
      evidence of negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use.
      10.2.2.3. Designate an appointing authority in writing or assume the responsibilities of
      the appointing authority.
      10.2.2.4. At their option, authorize the appointing authority to take action on a ROS
      when the amount of the loss or damage is less than $2,000 and there is no evidence of
      negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use. This authorization is
      included in the written designation of the appointing authority. If the amount is $2,000 or
      more, the approving authority acts on the ROS.
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                      35


     10.2.2.5. Designate in writing the name of the individual, who as the ROS program
     manager, is responsible for the efficient operation of the ROS program. The program
     manager's responsibilities and duties are addressed in Chapter 11. To ensure that there
     is only one program manager per base, the designation will be made by the senior
     approving authority on the base.
     10.2.2.6. Make determinations on appeals of liability. If denied, send appeals to the next
     higher commander.
     10.2.2.7. Ensure that the facts and circumstances of the case support the findings and
     recommendations of the investigating official. If not, the approving authority will direct
     the appointing authority to reaccomplish the ROS so that the findings and
     recommendations are logical actions to be taken based on the facts and circumstances.
     10.2.2.8. Consider the appropriateness of granting waivers of liability for housing
     damage when requested by the occupant. If waivers are not approved, forward the case
     with the requests for waiver to the next higher commander for action.
     10.2.2.9. Consider appropriateness of reducing or eliminating an assessment of financial
     liability based on the discretionary authorities granted to commanders in paragraph 8.6.
     10.2.2.10. Disapprove recommendations of investigating officials where warranted and
     notify the individuals accordingly.
     10.2.2.11. Make recommendations to the AFROTC region commander on ROS initiated
     by AFROTC units.
     10.2.2.12. Ensure the ROS is reviewed by a legal officer, that a written opinion is
     provided on the adequacy of evidence and propriety of the findings and recommendations
     in cases where financial liability is assessed, and that the legal opinion becomes part of
     the ROS file.
  10.2.3. Tenant Activities. The wing or installation approving authority takes action on all
  ROS originating within tenant activities on or attached to the base for logistical support,
  including major commands, intermediate commands, field operating agencies (FOAs), and
  direct reporting units (DRUs). This does not apply to ANG tenants unless a specific written
  agreement exists.
     10.2.3.1. In cases where a ROS involves a commander or deputy commander and
     negligence is evident, the approving authority forwards the ROS to the next higher
     command for action. If the case involves the commander or deputy commander of a
     MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU, forward the ROS to HQ USAF/LGS for final action.
     10.2.3.2. AFROTC units initially process all ROS through their respective host base
     ROS program manager to ensure proper preparation, legal review, and processing
     requirements are met. After review of the ROS, the host base approving authority, or
     designee, makes a recommendation to the AFROTC region commander; however, final
     approval authority remains with the appropriate AFROTC area commandant.
  10.2.4. Consider authorizing repair or replacement in kind. The approving authority may
  allow individuals who lose, damage, or destroy Air Force property to satisfy their liability by
  replacing or repairing the property; however, the approving authority must ensure the
  replacement property or repair to Air Force property meets minimum Air Force standards. If
36                                   AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


  there is any doubt as to whether the replacement property of repair meets Air Force
  standards, the property or repair will not be accepted. The approving authority may delegate
  this responsibility. For example, the housing officer may be designated to make the
  determination for government housing damage or the vehicle control officer for vehicle
  damage.
  10.2.5. Summary of Actions to Be Taken by the Approving Authority. The approving
  authority will take one of the following courses of action on the basis of personal review of
  the ROS:
     10.2.5.1. Approve the recommendations.
     10.2.5.2. Return the ROS to the appointing authority for reaccomplishment or
     reconsideration.
     10.2.5.3. Make new recommendations.
     10.2.5.4. Relieve the persons charged with financial liability from responsibility and or
     accountability for the lost, damaged, or destroyed property.
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                         37


                                          Chapter 11

                BASE ROS PROGRAM MANAGER RESPONSIBILITIES

11.1. General. This chapter prescribes the responsibilities of the report of survey
(ROS)program manager.
11.2. Appointment. Establishing a program manager is an Air Force requirement. Neither of
the DoD references cited in paragraph 1.2 prescribe or address the requirement for a program
manager. The approving authority will designate in writing who will be the ROS program
manager. To ensure that there is only one program manager per base, the designation will be
made by the senior approving authority on the base.
   11.2.1. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) A ROS program manager will be appointed within 86
   MSG for ADPE assets and 86 LRS for all other government owned/purchased assets.
11.3. Overall Program Manager's Responsibilities. The manager ensures that all aspects of
the ROS system function in a timely and efficient manner. The program manager works directly
for the senior approving authority on the base in carrying out the responsibilities addressed
below. This includes ROS initiated by AFROTC and tenant units. The manager also assists
appointing authorities, investigating officers and unit commanders as required. This includes
advising the approving and the appointing authorities if there appears to be, or possibly is, a
conflict on interest in personnel involved in processing the ROS.
11.4. Duties of Program Managers.
   11.4.1. Acts as installation focal point for ROS guidance and procedures.
       11.4.1.1. Maintains ROS information that will show trends and potential problem areas
       and will apprise the commander or the approving authority of the status and the results of
       the ROS program. This information may include statistics such as accountability
       assessments and the number, type, and dollar value of property lost, damaged, or
       destroyed by the unit. This information will be provided to the next higher headquarters
       as mutually agreed to by the program managers.
       11.4.1.2. As appropriate, keeps the MAJCOM program manager apprised of the status of
       the base program in a manner similar to that of the approving authority.
   11.4.2. Prepares internal operating procedures, checklists, and related documents. Also
   assists and advises accountable officers, responsible officers, property custodians, financial
   liability officers, and the approving authority. Conducts training as required or as requested.
   11.4.3. Provides guidance during investigations to boards and financial liability officers.
   11.4.4. Prepares correspondence involved in routing ROS for investigation, staff
   coordination, review, approval, due process, collection, and other ROS related actions.
   11.4.5. Follows up to ensure that ROS are processed expeditiously.           Also ensures that
   persons who submit ROS are aware they must do so promptly.
   11.4.6. Ensures the actual cost of repair, or if not available, an estimate, has been obtained
   before financial liability is assessed. Identifies any overcharges to be refunded.
 38                                   AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


   11.4.7. Ensures individuals being charged as being financially liable are promptly notified
   and are given the opportunity to make a written statement prior to ROS being sent to the
   approving authority.
       11.4.7.1. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) Electronic notification of individuals is permitted.
       Microsoft Outlook delivery receipts should be included as part of ROS case files.
   11.4.8. Ensures persons held financially liable by the approving authority are informed of
   their liability within five work days of the date in block 14h, DD Form 200, Financial
   Liability Investigation of Property Loss. If the approving authority is at a different
   location than the individual held liable, 12 work days are allowed for this notification.
   11.4.9. Ensures persons held financially liable by the approving authority are informed of
   their appeal rights (and waiver rights in housing damage cases) and are given the opportunity
   to review the file.
   11.4.10. Establishes suspense files to ensure expeditious processing of the ROS within the
   wing/installation as well as organizations outside of the wing, such as ROS files returned to
   the initiating organization for completion and certification of due process procedures or
   referred to higher headquarters for further action.
   11.4.11. Assists program managers at other bases when a member transfers before a ROS is
   completed.
   11.4.12. Maintains a manual or computerized ROS register. Each ROS will be serially
   numbered starting with number 1 at the beginning of each fiscal year. The register and
   copies of the ROS recorded on the register will be maintained for reference, use of auditors,
   and other personnel. Disposal will be as prescribed in paragraph 11.6 below. ROS that have
   not been completed by the end of the year must be entered on the new form for the new year
   before logging in any current (new) year ROS.
11.5. ROS Register. Program manager maintains register on AF Form 453, Report of Survey
Register. Columns A through G will be completed within 15 days from the reported date of loss
(see Chapter 5 on ROS Processing Times). A sample register is at Figure 11.1. An automated
register may be used if local computer capability exists.
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                 39

   11.5.5. Column E - Enter dollar value of the item and (L) for loss or (D) for damage or
   destruction.
   11.5.6. Column F - Enter a brief, general description of the item.
   11.5.7. Column G - Enter the name of the person(s) mentioned on DD Form 200 as
   responsible for losing or damaging the property.
   11.5.8. Column H - If a financial liability officer is appointed, enter the name and date of
   appointment.
   11.5.9. Column I - Enter the dollar amount of financial liability and insert (A) if assessed or
   (R) if relieved of liability.
   11.5.10. Column J - Enter name of final action officer and date.
   11.5.11. Column K - Explain any unusual circumstances or provide any pertinent comments
   (for example, appeal rendered, separation pending, etc.).
11.6. Disposition of Completed Registers and ROS.
   11.6.1. Disposition of Completed Registers. Rule 6, Table 23-23, AFM 37-139 states that
   registers and comparable forms that provide a complete record of each ROS may be
   destroyed one year after final action is completed on all entries of a terminated register.
   11.6.2. Disposition of Completed ROS. Rule 11, Table 23-23, AFM 37-139 states that ROS
   case files will be destroyed six years after final action by the appointing or approving
   authority.
       11.6.2.1. Rule 1 also states that ROS are located in the office of the ROS Program
       Manager.
       11.6.2.2. Table 23-23 also contains additional ROS disposition information.
11.7. Local Administrative Procedures. All installations must prepare base implementing
procedures to this manual. The type of procedure is at the option of the base or MAJCOM. For
example, it can be a supplement, a base implementing procedure, an operating instruction, or any
other appropriate document. Delegations of authority made by the commander or approving
authority may be made by position title as opposed to by name. This will eliminate the need to
update them as personnel change. Further, these delegations may be made a part of the
administrative instructions to ensure their permanence, that they are known to all concerned, and
eliminate the need to include them in the turn-over of files when personnel change.
11.8. Scheduled Separations. The initiator of a ROS must advise the program manager if any
person who may have caused the loss or damage to government property is scheduled for
separation. When this situation occurs, every effort should be made to expedite both the
completion of the ROS and the collection action. This requirement will be included in local
administrative procedures mentioned in paragraph 11.7. The program manager also notifies the
FSO of the impending debt.
   11.8.1. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) Separation Procedures:
       11.8.1.1. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) Individual notifies unit ROS monitor, Investigating
       Officer (IO, and the unit commander (CC) that his/her separation is imminent when
       notified an ROS is initiated and member may be financially liable.
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                      41


       11.8.1.2. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) Unit ROS monitor informs applicable ROS
       Program Manager of the separation when requesting ROS case number and provides date
       of final active duty pay.
       11.8.1.3. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) If at all possible, IO performs investigation, unit
       monitor reviews, CC certifies and signs DD Form 200, and the case file is submitted to
       applicable ROS Program Manager three weeks prior to date of last active duty pay
       period. If not possible, Commander should consider administrative hold. If that is not
       possible, IO includes a copy of member’s separation orders, a forwarding address, phone
       number, and e-mail address to allow for Defense Finance & Accounting Service (DFAS)
       to process collection if necessary. This info must also be placed in the ROS case file.
11.9. Pending Liability - Individual Transferred. If an individual transfers to another
installation before being notified that financial liability is being recommended by investigating
officials, the losing base program manager is primarily responsible for the notification and
collection process. However, both the losing and gaining base have responsibilities in assuring
the individual receives proper notification:
   11.9.1. Losing Base Program Manager's Responsibilities. The losing manager will:
       11.9.1.1. Obtain from the losing organization, or from any other source, the name and
       location of the installation to which the individual is being transferred and the name and
       organizational address of the gaining base ROS program manager.
       11.9.1.2. Ensure that the accountable and responsible officers have signed the DD Form
       200.
       11.9.1.3. Send the original and one copy of the DD Form 200, and a copy of the
       complete file to the gaining base program manager by a transmittal letter.
           11.9.1.3.1. The file consists of any documents that are material to the finding of
           negligence including a copy of the notification letter used locally to advise the
           individual of impending charges.
           11.9.1.3.2. The transmittal letter accompanying the complete file will request that
           formal notification be given to the individual being charged, and that a copy of block
           16 of DD Form 200 be completed and returned directly to the losing base program
           manager. The transmittal letter also will indicate the name, organizational address,
           and telephone number of the losing base program manager. (Samples of the
           notification letters are in attachments.)
           11.9.1.3.3. Establish a 42-day suspense (includes 12 day mailing time) for response
           from the gaining base. Upon receipt of the DD Form 200 with block 16 completed,
           or if no response is received after 42 days, processes the ROS for final action by the
           losing base approving authority. The gaining base is only responsible for notifying
           the person(s) held liable and obtaining acknowledgment on block 16 of the DD Form
           200.Collection procedures are placed in FSO channels at the losing base. See
           paragraph 11.9.2 for gaining base responsibilities.
           11.9.1.3.4. If the approving authority does not assess financial liability, the losing
           manager notifies the persons who were responsible for losing or damaging the
           property and closes the case.
 42                                    AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


           11.9.1.3.5. If the approving authority approves the recommendations and assesses
           financial liability, the losing manager notifies the assessed person(s) accordingly,
           advising them of their rights. A locally developed notification letter will suffice. If
           the person held financially liable fails to respond or does not file an appeal or waiver
           request within 42 days, the losing manager forwards DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment
           Authorization, with attached documents to the local FSO for involuntary collection
           of the amount due. If an appeal or waiver request is received within 42 days of
           notification, process it according to procedures in Chapter 17, Reconsiderations,
           Appeals, and Waivers.
   11.9.2. Gaining Base Program Manager Responsibilities:
       11.9.2.1. Upon receipt of ROS documents contact the commander of the individual
       charged and arrange for pickup or delivery of the documents.
       11.9.2.2. Write the losing base program manager to acknowledge receipt of the
       documents, including the date that the individual or their commander received the
       documents.
       11.9.2.3. If it appears that provisions of this manual have not been complied with or
       there are obvious errors in the ROS, send the file back to the losing base program
       manager pointing out the discrepancies.
       11.9.2.4. Follow-On Actions. Once the individual being assessed is notified, advise the
       losing base program manager. At this time the gaining base is no longer involved.
       Subsequent actions such as rebuttal statements, appeals, waiver requests, and collections,
       are conducted directly between the individual (or the individual's commander) and the
       losing base.
11.10. Interaction With Financial Services Officers (FSO). ROS program managers work
closely with the FSO to assure actions related to payroll deductions and collections are processed
promptly.
   11.10.1. Once the approving authority has assessed financial liability and applicable due
   process procedures are completed, the program manager provides a copy of the completed
   DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment Authorization or DD Form 362, Statement of
   Charges/Cash Collection Voucher, with attachments, to the FSO so that the debt can be
   recorded on the member's Master Military Pay Account (MMPA), however, the FSO will be
   requested not to collect the debt for 42 days.
   11.10.2. If an appeal or waiver request is filed within the time period specified in this
   manual, the FSO will be notified to suspend collection of the debt until the appeal or waiver
   request is ruled upon. This action does not remove the debt from the pay record, but merely
   suspends collection.
   11.10.3. The FSO cannot unilaterally delete or delay processing of a ROS debt without
   proper documentation. Collection procedures are outlined in Chapter 16.
11.11. Requests for Assistance. If situations arise that do not appear to be covered by this
manual, the base program managers should communicate with their command ROS program
manager. To avoid delays, telephone or E-Mail inquiries are encouraged.

                                         Chapter 12

       ACTIONS TAKEN ON ROS ABOVE WING OR INSTALLATION LEVEL

12.1. General. This chapter describes the roles and responsibilities of the intermediate
command, major command (MAJCOM), and HQ USAF/LGS in handling ROS and appeals.
12.2. Action on ROS. Commanders and directors or their designees at the intermediate
command, MAJCOM, and HQ USAF/LGS are essentially approving authorities at the higher-
command level. As such, they possess the same discretionary authority described in Chapter 8.
   12.2.1. Intermediate Command Commander:
       12.2.1.1. Takes action on ROS when the amount of financial liability to be assessed
       exceeds $10,000 but does not exceed $25,000, or when the senior host base commander
       is personally involved.
       12.2.1.2. Forwards a ROS to the MAJCOM commander for final approval when the
       amount of liability to be assessed exceeds $25,000, or when the intermediate command
       commander is personally involved.
       12.2.1.3. Approves or disapproves the recommendation of the subordinate commander or
       makes an additional recommendation. If the intermediate command commander's
       recommendation causes the amount of financial liability to be assessed to exceed
       $25,000, the ROS is sent to the MAJCOM commander for final approval.
   12.2.2. MAJCOM Commander. Takes action on all ROS not approved at base or
   intermediate command level, or when the intermediate command commander is personally
   involved. If the MAJCOM commander is personally involved and negligence is evident, the
   ROS is sent to HQ USAF/LGS for approval.
   12.2.3. HQ USAF/LGS. Takes action on any ROS when the MAJCOM commander is
   personally involved.
12.3. Action on Appeals.
   12.3.1. The Intermediate Command Commander takes action on appeals related to ROS if
   the commander is the approving authority. If the appeal is denied, forwards it to the
   MAJCOM commander for final action.
   12.3.2. The MAJCOM Commanders take final action "By Authority of the Secretary of the
   Air Force" on appeals of actions taken by lower-level organizations unless such authority has
   been delegated to the commanders of an intermediate command. Additionally, these
   commanders may delegate authority in writing to take final action on ROS appeals to a
   member of their immediate staffs. If the MAJCOM commander was the approving authority
   on the ROS and denies the appeal, it is forwarded to HQ USAF/LGS for final action.
   12.3.3. HQ USAF/LGS takes final action "By Authority of the Secretary of the Air Force"
   on appeals not granted by the MAJCOM or when the MAJCOM commander is personally
   involved.
 44                                   AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


12.4. Action on Waivers of Liability (Housing Damage Cases Only).
   12.4.1. Intermediate Command Commanders take action on requests for waiver of liability
   related to a ROS is the commander is the approving authority. If liability is not waived, the
   waiver request is forwarded to the MAJCOM commander for final action.
   12.4.2. MAJCOM Commanders take final action "By Authority of the Secretary of the Air
   Force" on waiver requests when liability was not waived by lower-level organizations. If the
   MAJCOM commander was the approving authority on a ROS for which a waiver request
   was submitted, and does not waive the liability, the waiver request is forwarded to HQ
   USAF/LGS for final action.
   12.4.3. HQ USAF/LGS. Takes final action "By Authority of the Secretary of the Air Force"
   on waiver requests where liability is not waived by the MAJCOM commander.
12.5. Authority To Delegate Responsibility. The intermediate command, MAJCOM, or HQ
USAF/LGS can delegate in writing the authority to take action on a ROS and ROS appeals to a
member of their immediate staffs.
12.6. MAJCOM and Intermediate Command ROS Program Managers.
   12.6.1. Review all ROS and appeals to make sure all administrative requirements have been
   met.

                                          Chapter 13

      FINANCIAL LIABILITY OFFICER AND BOARD RESPONSIBILITIES AND
                               ACTIONS

13.1. General. This chapter implements the DoD Regulation cited in paragraph 1.2.2.
Paragraph 0704 of the DoDR pertaining to financial liability officers and paragraph 0705
addresses financial liability boards.
13.2. Financial Liability Officers (FLO). Generally an FLO will be a senior officer who,
based on experience, can bring to the case a broad perspective of Air Force policies and
procedures. The appointing or approving authority selects FLOs based on their training,
experience, aptitudes, and ability to conduct intelligent and impartial investigations. The FLO
will be an officer, unless the appointment of an NCO (E-7 or above) or a civilian employee (GS-
7, WG-9, WL-5, WS-1 or above) is justified in writing by the approving or appointing authority.
   13.2.1. A FLO's findings and recommendations are administrative, not judicial; therefore,
   the FLO reports are purely advisory; the opinions do not constitute final determinations or
   legal judgments; and the recommendations are not binding upon appointing and approving
   authorities.
   13.2.2. An FLO is required to be appointed when:
       13.2.2.1. The ROS initial investigative results are insufficient to make a determination of
       whether or not negligence or abuse was the proximate cause of the loss, damage, or
       destruction of government property and approving or appointing authority determines
       that a second investigation is warranted. In most cases, an FLO should not be required if
       the investigating officer accomplishes a proper investigation. (See paragraph 4.1.8)
       13.2.2.2. The value of the property lost, damaged, or destroyed, or the circumstances of
       the case warrant further investigation such as repetitive losses, evidence of negligence or
       abuse or large dollar losses.
       13.2.2.3. Requested by an accountable officer.
       13.2.2.4. Directed by higher authority.
   13.2.3. In some cases, the appointing authority may appoint himself or herself as an FLO.
   This is especially true when appointing authorities are also members of financial liability
   boards. If an FLO is to be appointed, it must be done within 10 workdays after the
   appointing or approving authority receives the ROS.
   13.2.4. Responsibilities and Duties of an FLO. These responsibilities and duties are
   basically the same as those of any investigating officer and are outlined in Chapter 7.
   13.2.5. Additional Responsibilities and Duties of FLOs. The primary purpose of the ROS is
   to determine responsibility for lost, damaged, or destroyed property. To determine such
   responsibility, the facts contributing to the loss or damage must be developed by
   investigation. The FLO investigation may establish the fact that some other individual is at
   fault. The FLO shall not limit the investigation to verifying statements of interested parties.
   Rather, the FLO shall perform an investigation as thoroughly as is needed to ensure that all
46                                   AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


  facts are fully developed, the interests of the government are fully served, and the rights of
  the involved individuals are fully protected.
     13.2.5.1. An FLO investigation is required to determine where responsibility and/or
     liability belongs without regard to the relationship of the responsible individual to the
     property. As an example, actions by the accountable officer, responsible officer, or
     property receipt holder should be investigated as well as actions of the users of the
     property.
     13.2.5.2. The FLO investigation is a critical phase of the ROS process. The FLO should
     determine the actual facts, not as alleged but as they actually occurred. The FLO's
     recommendations shall be evaluated in succeeding reviews; therefore, the
     recommendations must be supported by the findings and conclusions. The FLO:
     13.2.5.3. Should be able to make a determination from the findings and conclusions as to
     how the loss or damage occurred, whether negligence or abuse was involved, and
     whether negligence or abuse was the proximate cause of the loss or damage.
     13.2.5.4. Will record the findings, conclusions, and make recommendations based on
     findings and conclusions. The recommendation must indicate whether or financial
     liability should be assessed.
     13.2.5.5. Must afford to any person whose conduct or performance of duty may be
     subject to inquiry or who has a direct interest in the inquiry an opportunity to have their
     position considered. They may submit written statements that will become part of the
     FLO's investigation.
     13.2.5.6. Compiles evidence substantiating or refuting any statement prepared by the
     investigating officer and recorded in block 9 of the DD Form 200.
     13.2.5.7. Physically examines the damaged property, when available, and then releases it
     for repair or disposal. If feasible, this will be done on the first day that the FLO was
     appointed.
     13.2.5.8. Consults with or asks advice from the appointing authority, legal office,
     contracting office, security police, program manager, or any other individual or office
     whose expertise could help determine responsibility.
     13.2.5.9. Determines the amount of damage, if the property has been damaged. The
     value may be the cost of repairs or an estimate of the repairs obtained from technical
     manuals or other reliable sources. The FLO also determines the value of the property
     immediately before its damage if the property is not economically reparable. The
     accountable officer may be asked to assist if he or she has not been directly involved.
     13.2.5.10. Ensures that action is taken to exercise control over the property if the
     property is recovered during the investigation.
     13.2.5.11. Ensures that the total loss to the Government is computed correctly.
  13.2.6. The FLO's Findings. The FLO will have the advantage of being able to review the
  previously accomplished ROS. While this will provide a good starting point, the FLO must
  rethink any of the conclusions or recommendations made in blocks 9 and 10 of DD Form
  200, and develop new findings and recommendations which may or may not agree with those
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                        47


   of the original investigating officer. These will be titled as "FINDINGS" and
   "RECOMMENDATIONS" in block 15a of the ROS (DD Form 200).
      13.2.6.1. The findings and conclusions reached by the FLO must be sound and based
      upon the evidence presented. In no case should they contain unsubstantiated opinions or
      phrases. The FLO will state how the loss or damage occurred, based on the evidence
      obtained through the investigation. The FLO's findings must substantiate or refute the
      statements made in block 9 and in affidavits or in additional statements that are a part of
      the report. Where facts are obtained by oral testimony, the individuals must be named
      and identified and direct statements quoted. (See Chapter 7 regarding obtaining sworn
      statements.)
      13.2.6.2. The FLO's findings should be complete enough so that others reviewing the
      report can readily determine the responsibility without referring the report back to the
      FLO forfurther investigation or information. The market or depreciated value of the
      property is notrequired in the findings unless financial liability is recommended. Where
      financial liability is recommended, the computation is made per Chapter 15.
   13.2.7. The FLO's Recommendation. After recording the findings, the FLO should record
   the recommendations in block 15a. A recommendation of financial liability or relief from
   liability is made for each individual involved. If financial liability is recommended, the FLO
   must indicate that the individual's negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized
   use was the proximate cause of the loss or damage. A recommendation also is made for the
   disposition of any unserviceable property not previously disposed of. Do not, under any
   circumstances, recommend disciplinary action.
   13.2.8. After completing block 15 of the ROS, the FLO returns the ROS file to the program
   manager for processing to the appointing or approving authority.
   13.2.9. The FLO is not officially relieved from the investigative tasking until relieved by the
   appointing authority or the approving authority.
13.3. Financial Liability Boards (FLB).
   13.3.1. Paragraph 070501, of the DoDR cited in paragraph 1.2.2 of this manual states that,
   "A financial liability board may be appointed by the appointing authority for the specific
   purpose of conducting the investigation. The primary purpose of a financial liability board is
   to provide the appointing and approving authorities with adequate information upon which to
   assess liability or relieve the involved individual from liability for the loss, damage or
   destruction of government property. A board provides more resources than an officer to
   investigate losses that are large, complex, or unique. Financial liability boards are
   administrative, not judicial. Therefore, their reports are purely advisory, their opinions do no
   constitute final determinations or legal judgments, and their recommendations are not
   binding upon appointing and approving authorities."
   13.3.2. The members of an FLB are selected based on training, experience, competence, and
   ability to conduct independent and objective investigations. The senior member normally
   shall be designated as the Chair or President of the FLB. The appointing authority shall not
   appoint an individual who was or is accountable or responsible, or has direct interest in the
   property, including a financial liability officer who may have previously investigated the loss
   of the property.
48                                    AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


  13.3.3. A financial liability board may consist of two or more persons, one of whom is the
  base claims officer. If an attorney, he or she acts as legal counsel for the board. With the
  recommendation of the organizational commander concerned, organization claims officers
  may be appointed by the wing/installation commander to FLBs. All FLB members are
  appointed on orders. A member of the board is appointed in the orders to serve as appointing
  authority. Whenever possible, the person authorized to serve as appointing authority will be
  of field grade as well as the other members of the board.
  13.3.4. Commissioned officers are normally appointed to FLBs. Because of the nature of
  base activities or the type of personnel by which manned, there may not be enough officers
  available to appoint to the board. If such condition exists, the commander may appoint
  qualified enlisted personnel to grade E-7, E-8, or E-9 or qualified civilian employees in grade
  GS-7 or above. The appointing or approving authority will provide a written statement for
  inclusion in the ROS file as to why it was necessary to appoint NCOs or civilians to the FLB.
  Commanders should be extremely careful to select competent personnel to conduct
  investigations.
  13.3.5. Functions of an FLB.
     13.3.5.1. The primary function of a FLB is to research, develop, assemble, record and
     analyze all available information relative to the loss. The board is required to formulate
     and clearly express consistent findings of facts, conclusions, and recommendations.
     13.3.5.2. A collateral function of the FLB, especially when requested by the appointing
     authority, is to afford a hearing to any person whose conduct or performance of duty may
     be subject to inquiry or who has direct interest in the inquiry.
     13.3.5.3. Additional FLB functions are to:
         13.3.5.3.1. Make a preliminary review of the ROS. This is to determine whether or
         not an FLO is required.
         13.3.5.3.2. Perform the function of FLO on ROS when the preliminary investigation
         indicates this is necessary. Members of the board acting as FLOs should follow the
         instructions in paragraph 13.2. The chair or president of the board can limit the scope
         of the investigation. This limitation must be acceptable to appointing or approving
         authority.
         13.3.5.3.3. Act as a group of disinterested persons to inspect and witness the
         destruction or abandonment of unserviceable property.
  13.3.6. Use of Investigative Reports. Reports of investigations of accidents or incidents may
  be used instead of investigations to support a ROS, depending on the circumstances. The
  FLB uses these investigative reports to determine the need for an FLO, determine financial
  liability or relief there-from, and make recommendations on the disposition of property and
  action to be taken by higher authority.
     13.3.6.1. When an FLO is required, the investigative report is used to support findings
     and recommendations. The FLO is not required to duplicate any part of the investigative
     report unless there is an indication that the investigation was incomplete.
     13.3.6.2. Investigative reports are attached to the ROS as exhibits.
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                  49


  13.3.7. Board Action on ROS.
     13.3.7.1. The board members take action on the DD Form 200. If a board member is
     appointed to serve as FLO, he or she complies with the duties and responsibilities
     outlined in paragraph 13.2.
     13.3.7.2. When the FLB completes its action, the ROS file, with the FLB documentation
     attached as a exhibit, will be returned to the ROS program manager for processing to the
     appointing or approving authority.

                    COMPLETING DD FORMS 139, 200, 362, AND 1131

14.1. DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss. A sample completed
DD Form 200 is at Figure 14.1. Many blocks in the form are self explanatory, therefore,
explanatory notes are provided only to further explain selected entries or to emphasize the entry.
Prepare and complete the DD Form 200 as follows:

  14.1.1. THE DD FORM 200 MUST BE TYPED. The original and one copy will be
  provided to the program manager. If the originating office wants a suspense file copy with
  the control number in block 2 returned to them, then that office will provide an original and
  two copies. More copies can be reproduced, if required, to fill the requirements of the base.
     14.1.1.1. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) DD Form 200 can be hand-written.
  14.1.2. Block 2. The ROS program manager assigns a control number within the first15
  days of the date the ROS is initiated (see Chapter 5). This provides a control or suspense for
  completion of the initiation phase.
  14.1.3. Block 4. Enter either the national stock number or manufacturer's part number. In
  the event there is no stock or part number, enter "N/A." Any number of transactions can be
  listed, as long as they pertain to the same incident and the persons responsible for the
  property are the same. Use an attachment if needed for additional items.
  14.1.4. Block 5. Enter the correct name of the property lost, damaged, or destroyed,
  including any serial numbers. If the property is not stock listed, give an accurate description
  sufficient for identification. If only a portion of a major item is damaged, describe the major
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                       53


  item fully, then describe the damages. If a vehicle is damaged, describe the type of vehicle
  and vehicle number. If additional space is needed, use bond paper, suitably captioned, as a
  continuation sheet.
  14.1.5. Block 6. Enter the quantity and if applicable, standard unit measure for the item.
  14.1.6. Block 7. Enter actual unit cost or standard price (current replacement cost). A copy
  of the Custodian Authorization/Custody Receipt Listing (CA/CRL) or a copy of the
  Automated Data Processing Equipment (ADPE) listing that identifies the current replacement
  cost of the lost, damaged or stolen item(s) should be forwarded with the ROS. Questions
  regarding prices should be referred to the officer who is accountable for the property.
  14.1.7. Block 8. Enter the result of quantity times unit cost. If a vehicle is involved include
  labor and material cost. If a vehicle has been damaged, include a copy of the estimate of
  damage (EOD) or actual cost document if the vehicle has been repaired.
  14.1.8. Block 9. The individual who initiates or investigates the ROS completes this block.
  See Chapter 7, Chapter 9, and Chapter 10. The recommendation of the investigating
  official should be included in this block or attached as an exhibit to the ROS. Further, if
  negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use appears to be evident, the
  amount of financial liability recommended will be computed. Block 9, if properly
  accomplished, can make the appointment of a financial liability officer unnecessary.
  Further, the information in this block can assist the appointing or approving authority in
  making a determination of whether or not negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate
  unauthorized use was the proximate cause of the loss, damage, or destruction.
     14.1.8.1. At HQ AFMC depot maintenance activities the Tool Loss Report (TLR) can be
     submitted with the ROS instead of completing block 9. The TLR must contain a detailed
     explanation of the facts and circumstances of the loss as required in this block.
     14.1.8.2. Include the equipment authorization inventory data (EAID) detail document
     number as applicable.
  14.1.9. Block 10. If investigations reveal deficiencies in directives, procedures, controls,
  etc., a statement of corrective action is required to document the action that was taken or will
  be taken to prevent recurrence of the incident. The originating office or the initial
  investigating official prepares the corrective action statement.
  14.1.10. Block 12b. The responsible officer or the reviewing authority enters his or her
  comments and recommendations. Use an attachment if needed.
  14.1.11. Block 13b. The appointing authority enters comments or rationale for the decision.
  Use an attachment if needed.
  14.1.12. Block 14a. The approving authority either approves or disapproves the
  recommendations of the investigating officer in block 9 or of block 15a if a financial liability
  officer was appointed.
  14.1.13. Block 14b. Use this block to specify the amount of financial liability assessed, relief
  from liability, and to describe disapprovals and prerogatives exercised under the provisions
  of waiving housing damage or discretionary limitations of liability. Use an attachment if
  needed.

  14.1.14. Block 15i. Enter the date the financial liability officer was appointed.
  14.1.15. Block 16a. The individual charged places an X in the proper box. If a financial
  liability officer was not appointed the individual charged should respond to the findings in
  blocks 9 through 12.
     14.1.15.1. When financial liability is recommended, the individual has the right to
     examine the findings and recommendations, to examine the evidence supporting the
     findings, and to submit evidence and statements on one's behalf which might refute any
     finding of negligence and which would be relevant to a determination of who should be
     held liable. This requirement must be accomplished before the ROS is sent to the
     appointing and approving authorities.
     14.1.15.2. If financial liability has not been previously recommended but the appointing
     authority makes a recommendation of financial liability, the individual charged must be
     given the right to review the file and make a statement prior to a determination being
     made by the approving authority.
     14.1.15.3. If housing damage is involved, a member must be advised that a fully
     substantiated waiver request may be submitted to the approving authority. Factors to be
     considered are in paragraph 19.7. (The waiver request is only considered if liability is
     eventually assessed by the approving authority, but must be submitted upon completion
     of block 16.) In the absence of a specific waiver request, a member will automatically
     receive waiver consideration based only on the ROS findings.
     14.1.15.4. If an individual does not sign a copy of the ROS in block 16g or does not
     respond to notification within 30 days, the original ROS is sent by the program manager
     to the appointing and approving authorities for assessment of or relief from financial
     liability. The reason for sending a copy is that the program manager must have the
     original on file at the completion of the case. Sending a copy precludes the loss of the
     original. Military members are entitled to free legal counsel. All Air Force members and
     employees are entitled to a copy of the completed ROS.
  14.1.16. Block 16b. To be read by the individual charged.
  14.1.17. Block 16c. Enter the organization address of the individual charged.
  14.1.18. Block 16d. Enter the typed name and rank or grade of the individual charged.
  14.1.19. Block 16e. Enter the social security number of the individual charged.
  14.1.20. Block 16f. Enter the DSN number of the individual charged.
  14.1.21. Block 16g. Signature of the individual charged.
  14.1.22. Block 16h. Enter the date the individual charged signed the DD Form 200.
  14.1.23. Block 17a. Enter the document numbers used to adjust the prepay records, if
  applicable. If not applicable enter "N/A". Blocks 17a through 17f should be completed
  following completion of block 12 in order that property records can reflect any adjustment at
  the earliest possible date and prior to completion of other actions on the DD Form 200.
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                        55


14.2. Privacy Act Statement, DD Form 200. Preparation of a ROS does not normally require
requesting personal information; however, the privacy act statement is printed at the top of the
DD Form 200.
14.3. Distribution of DD Form 200. The ROS will be prepared in an original and as many
copies as are required by the base.
   14.3.1. The original of the ROS and one copy is forwarded to the program manager for a
   control number. The copy is used as a suspense copy by the manager. The originating office
   may also forward another copy of the ROS to the program manager who will return it to
   them with the assigned control number for use as a suspense file. The program manager will
   prescribe the ROS processing procedures for the base.
   14.3.2. If the ROS results in an assessment of financial liability by the approving authority, a
   copy is forwarded to the FSO to establish the debt on the employee's pay account. The
   original of the ROS is kept with the program manager's files pending disposition in
   accordance with section 23, AFM 37-139, that replaces volume 20, table 177-9, AFR 4-20.
14.4. Voluntary Payments. Persons who have lost, damaged, or destroyed government
property valued at $500 or less may voluntarily pay for the property. These situations are
outlined in Chapter 3.
   14.4.1. Voluntary Payment. Voluntary payments are processed on DD Form 1131, Cash
   Collection Voucher, or DD Form 362, Statement of Charges/Cash Collection Voucher.
   14.4.2. Document Processing Requirement:
       14.4.2.1. In accordance with base agreements and ROS implementing procedures, either
       the unit commander or the ROS program manager will initiate voluntary payment
       documents for the loss, damage, or destruction of government property issued to their
       activities or to persons under the administrative control of the organization. This applies
       to property on Equipment Authorization Inventory Data (EAID) records, individual
       clothing and equipment records, and other similar accountable records or custody
       receipts.
       14.4.2.2. Voluntary payment documents must contain the statement, "Used instead of a
       ROS" if they are processed under the provisions of Chapter 16.
       14.4.2.3. Where lost, damaged, or destroyed property is recorded on property control
       records, the voluntary payment document must be used to support adjustment of the
       property account.
       14.4.2.4. The ROS program manager develops and issues procedures for preparing and
       processing voluntary payment documents.
       14.4.2.5. Additional information regarding voluntary payments is in AFM 67-1, volume
       IV, part one, chapter 8, paragraph 6.

                                          Chapter 15

                          COMPUTING FINANCIAL LIABILITY

15.1. General. Use the provisions of the chapter to compute and document the amount of
financial loss to the government. The loss to the government is also the basis for assessing
financial liability against individuals.
   15.1.1. Where financial liability is limited to one month's basic pay the actual loss to the
   government is still computed even if it exceeds one month's pay. In such cases, the financial
   liability against an individual is either the actual loss or one month's basic pay, whichever is
   less.
   15.1.2. Establishing Amount of Loss. The manner by which the government's damages are
   measured is determined by principles of law. Ascertaining the amount of damages is based
   on fact which must be proved by evidence. ROS prepared on the basis of damages to
   government property resulting from negligence must establish both the facts of actual loss to
   the government and negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use of the
   person or agency concerned. In addition, evidence must be submitted to establish the amount
   of the loss according to the following principles:
       15.1.2.1. Lost or Destroyed Property (Figure 15.1 and Figure 15.2). The amount of loss
       is the market value of the property immediately before the loss. In absence of a fair
       market value, use the adjusted replacement cost (paragraph 15.2).

      15.1.2.2. Irreparably Damaged Property and Property Damaged Beyond Economical
      Repair. The amount of loss is the market value of the property immediately before the
      damage less any salvage value.
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                       59


     15.1.2.3. Reparable Property. Where property is damaged and can be economically
     repaired, the measure of the damage is the difference in the market value of the property
     immediately before the damage and its market value immediately before the damage and
     its market value immediately after the damage in its injured condition.
         15.1.2.3.1. While the difference in values is generally the standard measure of the
         government's loss, the reasonable cost of the repairs necessary to restore the property
         to its condition before the damage may be used as evidence of the difference in the
         value of the property before and immediately after the damage. Hence, the reasonable
         cost of repair less any established overhaul allowances as outlined in paragraph 15.3
         may be proper, provided the repairs do not increase the value of the property above its
         market value before the damage.
         15.1.2.3.2. The government is not entitled to the full value of the repairs if they make
         the property more valuable than it was before the damage. Thus, the amount of the
         loss would be the cost of repairs less any increase in value.
     15.1.2.4. Reparable Property - Military Family Housing. The cost of repair includes the
     following elements:
         15.1.2.4.1. Labor costs, including in-house labor (paragraph 15.1.5) and contractor
         labor.
         15.1.2.4.2. Cost of government-provided equipment and furnishings, (cooking
         stoves, couches, chairs, tables, washer, dryer, refrigerator, etc.) based on fair market
         value before loss of damage. In the absence of a fair market value at the time of loss
         or damage, use the adjusted replacement cost (paragraph 15.2)
         15.1.2.4.3. Cost of installed equipment (furnace, hot water heater, central air
         conditioning, etc.) based on adjusted replacement cost.
         15.1.2.4.4. Cost of fixtures, cabinets, book shelves, etc., based on adjusted
         replacement cost.
         15.1.2.4.5. Cost of direct materials such as lumber, paint, wallboard, nails, adhesives,
         etc.
  15.1.3. Use of Actual or Estimated Repair Charges. Where financial liability is assessed
  against an individual for damage to property that is reparable, the amount to be assessed in
  the ROS is based on actual cost of repair.
     15.1.3.1. Estimated repair costs may be applied to ROS only in unusual and exceptional
     circumstances where actual repair costs cannot be obtained within a reasonable length of
     time (for example, where it is determined that the damaged property cannot be
     immediately restored to use, or where the repairs are unduly delayed due to lack of parts
     or backlog in the repair facility or requirement to ship the property to another facility for
     repair, or similar situations).
     15.1.3.2. In such cases, the reason for using estimated repair costs must be fully
     documented on the ROS. An estimated cost of repair is computed by qualified technical
     personal on the basis of current applicable labor rates and material costs necessary to
     accomplish the repair. Estimated costs are converted to actual costs upon completion of
60                                     AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


     the repair and the ROS is amended accordingly. If collection action is complete, see
     paragraph 16.2.3.
  15.1.4. Transportation Costs. Where it is necessary to transport the damaged property for
  repairs to a repair facility, the transportation costs to and from the facility may be included, if
  it is shown that repairs were not obtainable locally at less cost. If a government bill of lading
  (GBL) is used, the transportation cost is the amount paid the carrier. If government
  transportation is used, standard labor rates in AFI 65-503 are used to determine labor costs.
  15.1.5. Repair Costs and Costing Methods. For the purpose of determining financial liability
  on ROS, only direct labor and direct material are charged when repairs are done in-house.
  Indirect or overhead costs are not charged. When repairs are performed by a private
  contractor, the amount paid to the contractor is charged. Direct labor and direct material are
  further defined as follows:
     15.1.5.1. Direct Labor. Direct labor charges computed by the Base Engineer Automated
     Management System (BEAMS) or by the On-Line Vehicle Interactive Management
     System (OLVIMS) are acceptable for determining labor costs for in-house repairs of
     facilities and vehicles. Direct labor charges generated by the Real Property Industrial
     Fund (RPIF) cost systems are also acceptable for facilities repair. In absence of these
     methods, direct labor is computed by applying the standard labor rate in AFI 65-103 to
     the actual man-hours worked to repair the damaged property.
     15.1.5.2. Direct Material. Actual cost of all direct material drawn against the
     reimbursable repair job (excludes bench stock materials) as identified by BEAMS,
     VIMS, RPIF, or other sources.
  15.1.6. Repair in Non-Air Force Government Facilities. When property is repaired by a
  non-Air Force government facility, the amount of financial liability is the amount reimbursed
  to the other agency per the cross-servicing agreement plus any expense to the Air Force
  (transportation, etc.).
  15.1.7. Repair Cost Statements. When damaged property is repaired, include one copy of
  AF Form 20, Repair Cost and Reparable Value Statement (Damaged Property) is filed
  with the ROS. A sample completed form is at Figure 15.1. A technical qualified person
  signs the form. Support the form with copies of invoices, payment documents, freight bills,
  GBLs, etc., as appropriate.
  15.1.8. Market Value. In general, the market value is the price a willing buyer would pay a
  willing seller. This value is based on estimates of those familiar with the selling process or
  by open market prices such as those attainable from surplus stores. Consider the market
  value at the time and place of loss or irreparable damage, using the nearest available market.
  15.1.9. Property Having No Market Value. Where property has no market value established,
  determine the value by using the adjusted replacement cost method described in paragraph
  15.2.
  15.1.10. Leather Flying Jackets. An exception from the procedures of this paragraph is
  made for leather flying jackets. HQ USAF/LGS has determined that when a leather flying
  jacket is lost, damaged, or destroyed through negligence as determined by the ROS process,
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                        61


   the member is required to pay the current stock list price for a new leather flying jacket prior
   to being issued another leather flying jacket.
15.2. Adjusted Replacement Cost.
   15.2.1. Computation Method. In the absence of a fair market value for property at the time
   and place of loss, irreparable damage, or damage beyond economical repair, determine the
   government's loss based on the adjusted replacement cost. This method consists of
   determining the current replacement cost of a like item, depreciating the replacement cost by
   the number of years the lost or damaged item was used (based on an estimated or published
   useful life of the item) and subtracting the salvage value, if any, of the damaged item.
   15.2.2. Any generally accepted depreciation method may be used. The preferred method is
   one that most realistically represents the value of the property at the time of loss or damage.
   Officially published depreciation standards and factors should be considered. Other factors
   to be considered in arriving at a realistic measure of loss are:
      15.2.2.1. The actual condition of the property before its loss or damage and the expected
      continued length of serviceability of the property had it not been lost or made
      unserviceable.
      15.2.2.2. Where possible, individual major assembly maintenance or historical records
      should be consulted to determine the serviceability of components or subassemblies
      which would have required immediate replacement of overhaul, had not the major
      assembly been lost, irreparably damaged, or damaged beyond economical repair.
      15.2.2.3. In computing allowances for any serviceable spare parts recovered, use the
      same depreciation method as applied to the end item.
   15.2.3. Computation Statement. When allowances are made for depreciation, ROS initiators
   or investigating officials must include a statement indicating the factors considered and
   methods by which the depreciation was computed so that a proper assessment may be made
   by the approving authority. This statement or other documents will be attached to the file
   and will show:
      15.2.3.1. Source of published depreciation factors.
      15.2.3.2. Date of manufacture.
      15.2.3.3. Original acquisition cost.
      15.2.3.4. Replacement cost of a like item and source of this quotation.
      15.2.3.5. Estimated life expectancy.
      15.2.3.6. State of obsolescence.
   15.2.4. Small Tools. Small hand tools are considered useful throughout their entire life and,
   therefore, are not depreciated.
   15.2.5. Depreciation of Parachutes. The value of lost or destroyed parachutes is determined
   by using a depreciation rate of 14 percent per year on the invoice or stock list price, not to
   exceed a total of 80 percent. This is a standard or norm and may be varied under exceptional
   circumstances.
 62                                     AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


   15.2.6. Depreciation of Vehicles. Depreciation is based on the age or mileage life
   expectancy tables as shown in Technical Order-00-25-249, Maximum Repair Allowances
   and Replacement Codes for USAF Vehicles. Use straight-line depreciation, not to exceed 80
   percent. Deduct the estimated cost of any repairs that were required before the loss or
   destruction. Deduct reclaimed (salvaged) parts at 50 percent of the Air Force cost for a like
   item.
   15.2.7. Useful Life and Disposal Value Table. Reference also may be made to the "Useful
   Value and Disposal Value Table" which is attachment 2 to AFP 26-12, Guidelines for
   Implementing the Air Force Commercial Activities Program, 25 Sep 92. The AFP 26-12 will
   be converted to AFM 38-209 in 1996 or 1997. This table provides a listing of Federal Stock
   Classes (FSCs), nomenclatures, expected useful life in years, and a disposal value factor as a
   percent of acquisition cost. This is a Federally developed list extracted from the Supplement
   to Office of Management and Budget Circular A 76 (Revised), Performance of Commercial
   Activities, Aug 4, 1983.
15.3. Standard Overhaul Allowances. An allowance may be made for standard overhaul
charges when they are established. The inclusion of the overhaul is a matter of judgment on the
part of investigating officials. If the property is comparatively new, has not been in use long
enough to require repair, or has been recently overhauled, no allowances should be granted.
15.4. Credit for Salvage. When property is damaged to the point where it must be scrapped,
salvage credit is allowed for the salvage or scrap value, including the scrap value of parts
recovered from the property which has been repaired.
   15.4.1. In no case is the full list price of such parts allowed for salvage credit. If entire units
   are salvaged, credit is determined by the property disposal officer based on the scrap value of
   the entire unit or the value of the scrap recovered plus the current value of major serviceable
   subassemblies, if any.
   15.4.2. In no case is credit given for each component part of entire units or subassemblies
   that are salvaged. If, after the total assembly is depreciated, serviceable parts are recovered
   by disassembly of units or subassemblies, the value of the parts recovered is not considered
   for the purpose of giving further credit in computation of financial liability.
15.5. Determining Costs for Lost Property. A sample completed AF Form 20 pertaining to
lost property is at Figure 15.2.
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                     63


                                         Chapter 16

             VOLUNTARY PAYMENTS, COLLECTIONS, AND REFUNDS

16.1. Voluntary Payments.
   16.1.1. Paragraph 070204 of the DoD Regulation cited in paragraph 1.2.2 prescribes DoD
   policy pertaining to voluntary payments and is implemented in this chapter.
   16.1.2. Guidance. Air Force members and employees may voluntarily pay the government
   for lost, damaged, or destroyed government property. Voluntary payment may be made any
   time before or during the ROS process. In some cases, voluntary payments are made in lieu
   of a ROS. In other cases, voluntary payments are made as a result of an investigating
   official's recommendation or approving authority's assessment. Voluntary payment may be
   accepted in lieu of a ROS providing the following criteria are met:
      16.1.2.1. The individual is offering the payment on his or her own volition and is not
      being coerced or threatened with adverse action if payment is not made. Adverse action
      could consist of administrative action and judicial or nonjudicial punishment.
      16.1.2.2. The individual is aware that no administrative determination of a debt exists,
      and that there is no legal obligation to the government.
      16.1.2.3. The individual is aware that voluntary payment may not be withdrawn later.
      16.1.2.4. The individual is aware that the normal avenues of relief (appeal, waiver,
      remission, etc.) are not available if voluntary payment is made.
      16.1.2.5. If the individual is offering to pay for loss or damage in excess of one month's
      basic pay, the person must be made aware that if a ROS were prepared, the liability might
      be limited to one month's basic pay.
      16.1.2.6. If the loss or damage exceeds one month's basic pay, and the individual offers
      to voluntarily pay one month's basic pay, voluntary payment can be accepted if the loss
      or damage does not involve:
          16.1.2.6.1. Assigned government housing damage where gross negligence or willful
          misconduct may be evident.
          16.1.2.6.2. Loss or damage to personal arms or equipment.
          16.1.2.6.3. Loss or damage where an accountable officer is involved.
   16.1.3. Completing the DD Form 200. When a ROS investigating official has recommended
   an assessment of financial liability in block 9, DD Form 200, the individual responsible for
   the loss or damage may voluntarily pay the amount specified on the DD Form 200 unless the
   assessment is a reduced liability.
      16.1.3.1. If the investigating official recommends reduced liability, the approving
      authority must review and sign the DD Form 200 before the individual responsible for the
      loss or damage may voluntarily pay the recommended amount.
      16.1.3.2. In these situations, the ROS process is terminated and the register is annotated
      to reflect voluntary payment. By making voluntary payment at this time, the individual
 64                                   AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


       thereby relinquishes the right of appeal, waiver, remission, or any other relief from
       financial liability.
   16.1.4. Payment by the Individual. An approving authority has assessed financial liability
   against an individual, that individual may voluntarily pay the amount assessed. In this
   instance, the ROS is final and further processing is not necessary.
       16.1.4.1. In this case however, a legal debt was administratively determined, and the
       individual may later appeal the assessment of financial liability within the time limit
       prescribed in Chapter 17.
       16.1.4.2. The person should be made aware that remission or waiver of claims is not
       available because the debt was paid.
   16.1.5. Voluntary Payment Documentation. Voluntary payments are processed on DD Form
   1131, Cash Collection Voucher or DD Form 362, Statement of Charges/Cash Collection
   Voucher.
   16.1.6. Document Processing Requirement:
       16.1.6.1. Unit commanders initiate voluntary payment documents for the loss, damage,
       or destruction of government property issued to their activities or to persons under their
       command or administrative control. This applies to property on Equipment Authorization
       Inventory Data (EAID) records, individual clothing and equipment records, and other
       similar accountable records or custody receipts.
       16.1.6.2. Voluntary payment documents must contain the statement, "Used instead of a
       ROS".
       16.1.6.3. Where lost, damaged, or destroyed property is recorded on property control
       records, the voluntary payment document must be used to support adjustment of the
       property account.
       16.1.6.4. The ROS program manager develops and issues procedures for preparing and
       processing voluntary payment documents.
          16.1.6.4.1. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) Voluntary payment procedures.
              16.1.6.4.1.1. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) Individual prepares DD Form 1131,
              Cash Collection Voucher, with assistance from the unit ROS monitor.
              16.1.6.4.1.2. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) Individual provides DD Form 1131 to
              Financial Services Officer (FSO) for processing.
              16.1.6.4.1.3. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) Individual provides unit monitor and
              applicable ROS Program Manager with copy of endorsed DD Form 1131 to close
              ROS.
16.2. Collections.
   16.2.1. General. This paragraph establishes collection procedures to be followed when
   financial liability is assessed; and when repayment of an amount collected or withheld is in
   excess of the amount due is required.
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                        65


  16.2.2. Collection From Air Force Members and Employees (Including All Air Force, Air
  Force Reserve, Air National Guard (ANG), Active Guard/Reserve (AGR) Personnel
  Including Civilian and ANG Technicians).
     16.2.2.1. When an Air Force member or employee is held financially liable, the
     approving authority notifies the individual in writing of the type and amount of the debt.
     The written notification advises the individual of the following:
        16.2.2.1.1. The requirement to make lump-sum remittance within 30 days from the
        date of the written debt notification direct to the FSO and the right to request a written
        agreement to repay the debt in installments. A request for installment payments must
        be accompanied by the debtor's financial statement submitted under penalty of
        perjury.
        16.2.2.1.2. The right to inspect and copy records relating to the debt.
        16.2.2.1.3. The right to review the decision relating to the debt.
        16.2.2.1.4. Notification of an enlisted member's right to request a remission of
        indebtedness and an officer's right to request SAF waiver for damage to government
        housing.
        16.2.2.1.5. The right to appeal the findings of the ROS. Appeal must be submitted
        within 30 days from the date an individual is notified of financial liability.
        (EXCEPTION: In cases where the amount of assessed liability exceeds 1 month's
        basic pay, a written intent to appeal must be submitted within 30 days and the appeal
        must be submitted 60 days from the date the individual is notified of financial
        liability.)
        16.2.2.1.6. The intention of the Air Force to make involuntary deductions from the
        individual's pay if voluntary lump-sum payment is not made within 30 days of
        liability notification or completion of the appeal process if an appeal is filed and the
        financial liability is upheld.
        16.2.2.1.7. That any portion of the debt uncollected at time of employment
        termination is collected from the individual's final pay and allowances.
     16.2.2.2. Written notification is either hand-delivered with a receipt of notice executed or
     sent by certified or registered mail with return receipt requested. Because the Air Force
     must be able to demonstrate that individuals held financially liable have received demand
     letters and notices of intent to effect involuntary collection, these receipts are included in
     the ROS case file.
     16.2.2.3. See AFR 177-102, paragraph 29-2, for additional information on collections.
  16.2.3. Collections From Members:
     16.2.3.1. Statutory authority for the involuntary collection of an indebtedness from a
     member is 37 U.S.C. Section 1007. Notification procedures prescribed in paragraph
     16.2.2 satisfy requirements to effect involuntary collections. Remission and or waiver
     processing is accomplished by the FSO. (paragraph 16.2.6)
     16.2.3.2. If remittance is not received within 30 days from the date the Air Force
     member is notified of financial liability and the member does not submit an appeal to the
66                                   AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


     ROS findings within 30 days (or indicates in writing the intent to appeal when the 60-day
     appeal time frame is appropriate), the approving authority sends a completed copy of the
     DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss, to the FSO for
     involuntary collection action. This includes evaluation of the member's request to make
     installment payments. In compliance with DoD 7000.14-R, the approving authority
     certifies the completion of due process procedures in paragraph 16.2.2.
  16.2.4. Collections From Civilian Employees: (Also see DoD 7000.14-R, volume 8, chapter
  8.)
     16.2.4.1. General statutory authority for the involuntary collection of an indebtedness
     from an appropriated fund civilian employee, ANG technician, or Air Force Reserve
     technician is 5 U.S.C. Section 5514. Notification procedures prescribed in paragraph
     16.2.2 do not satisfy requirements to effect involuntary collection under this statute. ROS
     appeal channels must be exhausted before involving involuntary salary offset under 5
     U.S.C. Section 5514.
     16.2.4.2. If appeal is not submitted within established time frames, ROS appeal rights are
     forfeited. If the appeal right is forfeited or if the appeal is denied by the appellate
     authority designated to take final action on the appeal, the case file is returned to the ROS
     approving authority (creditor organization). The creditor organization must then make
     sure notification and due process protections required by DoD 7000.14-R, chapter 8,
     paragraph 080303 are applied. Authority to offset from retired civilian pay is in 31
     U.S.C. Section 3716 and is prescribed by AFR 177-104, paragraphs 9-10 and 15-13 and
     DoD 7000.14-R, chapter 8, paragraph 080506.Sample letter formats for notification by
     creditor organizations are provided in chapter 21, AFR 177-104, figure 21-5 through
     figure 21-9 and DoD 7000.14-R, chapter 8, pages 247 through 254. The authority for the
     involuntary collection of an indebtedness from an Air Force non-appropriated fund
     employee is AFI 34-202.
     16.2.4.3. The ROS program manager establishes a suspense file for all ROS cases
     referred to the creditor organization for completion of due process procedures. Initial
     follow-up with the creditor organization is accomplished 45 days after the case is referred
     and subsequently at 30-day intervals until collection action is completed or the ROS case
     is returned for involuntary collection action. Creditor organizations are required to
     certify completion of due process procedures before submission to the FSO for
     involuntary collections.
  16.2.5. Collection From States, ANG/AGR Members, and ANG Technicians. The
  approving authority starts collection action on ANG ROS. That office advises the senior
  hose-base commander of each financial charge against an ANG/AGR member or ANG
  technician. The notice identifies the pertinent ROS and establishes a 60-day suspense for
  collection of the debt (Chapter 22).
     16.2.5.1. State Held Liable.     The state adjutant general reimburses the Air Force
     (Chapter 22).
     16.2.5.2. ANG/AGR Member Held Liable. The wing/installation commander informs
     individuals of their rights and initiates collection action. The senior host-base
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                       67


     commander reports the initiation and collection to the approving authority. Collection
     procedures are prescribed in paragraph 16.2.2.
     16.2.5.3. ANG Technician Held Liable. Procedures in paragraph 16.2.4 apply.
  16.2.6. Financial Services Officer (FSO) Actions in Collecting Debts.
     16.2.6.1. Collection Procedures for Members. After the approving authority assesses
     financial liability, the following procedures apply:
         16.2.6.1.1. Members are notified by the ROS program manager (acting on behalf of
         the approving authority), and are given 30 days to pay the amount due. If payment is
         not arranged within 30 days, the approving authority certifies completion of due
         process and sends DD Form 362 or DD Form 139 with attachments to the FSO for
         recording on the individual's pay record and initiation of involuntary collection
         action. Involuntary collections are processed according to AFM 177-373, Volume 1,
         Chapter 53, and other appropriate accounting and finance directives.
         16.2.6.1.2. Members held liable may appeal the findings within 30 days of the date
         they were notified of the assessment of financial liability (see Chapter 17). Upon
         notification of an appeal submission (or an intent to appeal when the 60 day rule
         applies to the approving authority), the FSO suspends collection of the debt pending
         the results of the appeal. If the appeal is granted, the FSO cancels the debt. If the
         appeal is denied, the FSO continues involuntarily collection of the debt.
         16.2.6.1.3. Members held liable for damage to government housing are allowed to
         request waiver of financial liability (Chapter 17). Upon notification of a waiver
         request, the FSO suspends collection of the debt pending waiver results. If the
         liability is partially waived, the FSO cancels the waived portion and continues
         involuntarily collection of the unwaived portion.
         16.2.6.1.4. Occasionally, collection is made from a member whose pay record is
         maintained by another servicing FSO (paragraph 11.9). The supporting document for
         such a collection is a DD Form 200 signed in block 14g. The FSO processes a DD
         Form 139, Pay Adjustment Authorization, to record the debt on the member's pay
         record.
         16.2.6.1.5. Collection Procedures for Civilian Employees. After all ROS actions,
         including final action on ROS appeals, and all due process protections required by
         AFR 170-30 and DoD 7000.14-R are completed; the ROS, with certification of
         completion of due process attached, is sent to the FSO for recording on the
         individual's pay record and initiation of involuntary collection action.
  16.2.7. Collections - Joint and Several Liability. Each person held liable jointly and
  severally with others is liable for the entire amount of the loss or damage. The total financial
  liability must equal the total dollar loss to the Air Force except in cases where financial
  liability is limited per paragraph 2.3.13. The approving authority determines the amount to
  be collected from each individual.
  16.2.8. Collection for Government Property Checked as Baggage. When government
  property checked as personal baggage is lost in transit, send a letter explaining the loss, a
 68                                   AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


   copy of the DD Form 200, baggage claim check, and other related documents to DFAS for
   filing a claim with the carrier.
   16.2.9. Reciprocal Agreement Between Army and Air Force. This agreement also is
   included in paragraph 14-32.f., Army Regulation (AR) 735-5. The agreement is quoted
   below.
       “(1) In processing ROS, a situation occasionally develops where personnel of the Air
Force are determined to be liable for loss, damage, or destruction of Army property and vice
versa. The Army and the Air Force have agreed that the action on and routing of the ROS is
governed by the regulations of the property's owning service without regard to the service
assignment (parent service) of the respondent.
        “(2) When a ROS results in a finding that a member, whose parent service is other than
the property's owing service, should be held liable for the loss, damage, or destruction of the
property involved, forward the ROS to the parent service's ROS approving authority with
jurisdiction to act on ROS concerning the member involved.
              “(a) The owning service's ROS will contain all evidence gathered as a result of
           the report, the findings and recommendations of the surveying (Air Force read as
           investigating instead of surveying) officer, and recommendations of the owning
           service's appropriate ROS approving authority.
              “(b) The parent service approving authority will take action on the findings and
           recommendations according to the parent service's ROS regulations. Collection will
           be pursued under the parent service regulation.
              “(c) The parent service approving authority will take action to notify the owning
           service approving authority of the action taken on the ROS or to reconcile any
           differences in the anticipated action and recommendations of the owning service.”
   16.2.10. Collection From Navy or Marine Corps Members. When financial liability has
   been assessed against Navy or Marine Corps personnel, the following procedures apply:
       16.2.10.1. Notify the member in the same manner as for Air Force members. Request
       lump-sum payment of the amount due.
       16.2.10.2. If after 90 days from initial notification, the member fails to pay, either in
       lump-sum or installments, and there is no indication that an appeal was filed within 60
       days of notification, send the ROS file to the FSO for referral to DFAS for collection
       assistance. The file must contain the appropriation to be credited (Treasury receipt
       account, local operation and maintenance, local family housing operation and
       maintenance, stock or industrial fund), SSN, and the member's last known address.
   16.2.11. Collection From Separated Members. If an Air Force member separates before a
   ROS is completed, the following procedures apply:
       16.2.11.1. If the member has not been notified of an impending financial liability before
       his or her separation, notification must be given in the same manner as for active duty
       members. The forwarding address can be obtained from the FSO. If the separated
       member does not respond to the initial notification within 42 days, including 12 days
       mailing time, send the ROS to the approving authority for final action. If the approving
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                      69


     authority assesses financial liability, again notify the separated member of the assessment
     in the same manner as the active duty members. If, after 90 days from initial notification,
     collection is not being made or the separated member does not respond, transfer the case
     file to the FSO for referral to DFAS for collection assistance. Include notification letters
     in the transferred file.
     16.2.11.2. If a member separates after signing block 16g, DD Form 200, but before the
     approving authority assesses financial liability, give notification of the approving
     authority's assessment in the same manner as for active duty members (forwarding
     address can be obtained from the FSO. If, after 90 days from initial notification, the debt
     is not being collected or the separated member fails to respond, transfer the case file to
     the FSO for referral to DFAS for collection assistance. Include notification letters in the
     transferred file. FSO notification can also be taken before 90 days if the post office
     returns mail indicating it cannot locate the addressee (see paragraph 1.6.2).
     16.2.11.3. Do not send ROS files to the FSO until the procedures in this paragraph have
     been accomplished unless the debtor cannot be contacted. If files are transferred to the
     FSO, they must contain the appropriation to be credited, SSN, and the member's last
     known address.
  16.2.12. Collection From Retired Members. If an Air Force member retires before a ROS is
  completed, the following procedures apply:
     16.2.12.1. If a member has not been notified of an impending financial liability before
     his or her retirement, accomplish notification and disposition in the same manner as in
     paragraph 16.2.11.
     16.2.12.2. If local collection cannot be made using procedures prescribed in this chapter,
     the files are transferred to the FSO for referral to DFAS for offset against the member's
     retired pay.
     16.2.12.3. If a member has acknowledged an impending assessment of financial liability
     by signing block 16g, DD Form 200, before retirement, notification of the approving
     authority's assessment is accomplished in the same manner as in paragraph 16.2.11. If
     local collection cannot be made, transfer these files for collection to the FSO.
     16.2.12.4. Do not send ROS files to the FSO for referral to DFAS for collection until the
     procedures in this paragraph have been accomplished. If files are transferred to the FSO,
     they must contain, as a minimum, the retiree's social security number and the amount of
     the debt. In the transmittal memorandum, request a treasury check be sent to the FSO
     maintaining the accounts receivable and cite receipt account 573019. When the check is
     received by the FSO, the proper account is credited (paragraph 16.2.13).
  16.2.13. Accounting for Collections and Receivables. NOTE: This paragraph is included for
  your information. The procedures listed below are accomplished primarily by DFAS.
     16.2.13.1. Credit collections, whether cash or by voucher deduction, to General Fund
     (Miscellaneous) Receipts, Recoveries for Government Property Lost Or Damaged
     (573019). Collections for government property lost, damaged, or destroyed of other DoD
     components must also cite this receipt account. Collections for damage to family housing
     are credited to the Family Housing Management Account. Collections for damage to
 70                                    AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


       unaccompanied personnel housing are credited to the local O&M appropriation.
       Collections for loss or damage to Air Force stock or industrial fund property is credited to
       the appropriate division of the fund involved. Collections for loss or damage to property
       of a vendor, contractor, or another government that the United States Government has an
       obligation to return are credited according to the provisions of the contractor the
       regulations of the theater of operations implementing the international agreement.
       16.2.13.2. Refund receivable records are established by DFAS upon notification from the
       ROS program manager for ROS debts that are credited to accounts other than 573019
       when collected. Receivables for uncollectible accounts may be transferred to the DFAS
       Debt Collection Office only after notification and follow-up requirements in paragraph
       16.2.11 have been met by the creditor organization. The FSO notifies the ROS program
       manager when the case file is transferred. Once transferred, no further follow-up action
       is required by either the FSO or the ROS program manager. For debts, where offset is
       available against a member's retired pay, the DFAS retains accountability for related
       refunds receivable. DFAS makes offsets and transfers funds collected to the DFAS office
       at the originating base (paragraph 16.2.12) to liquidate the refunds receivable. Close
       coordination with the ROS program manager is required.
   16.2.14. Cases Not Covered By Paragraph 16.2. In these cases, the program manager should
   query the FSO regarding how to address the problem.
16.3. Refunds.
   16.3.1. Refund of Erroneous Collections. If voluntary payment has been made and the
   missing item is later located or when the financial liability on a ROS is reduced or canceled
   and collection has been made:
       16.3.1.1. The approving authority informs the individual concerned of the adjustment,
       authorizes refund of the amount collected, and advises the FSO in writing to process the
       refund. The refund voucher must be supported by references to the collection voucher or
       military pay order (MPO) number used for the initial collection and a copy of the
       document containing the reason for the refund.
       16.3.1.2. If final action on the ROS was by the intermediate command or major
       command approving authority, correspondence authorizing repayment is sent to the base
       of origin. Attach the correspondence to a copy of DD Form 200.
       16.3.1.3. In accordance with AFR 177-101, chapter 25, refunds cannot be disbursed
       directly out of receipt account 573019. To refund charges collected into receipt account
       573019, process an SF 1081, Voucher and Schedule of Withdrawals and Credits,
       debiting (taking the money out of) 573019 and crediting (putting the money into)
       57X6875. Then process an SF 1049, Public Voucher for Refunds, to refund the money
       to the member citing 57X6875.
16.4. Members Reassigned. If a member from whom a collection was made has been
transferred from the organization originating the charge, all concerned should refer to AFM 177-
373, volume I.
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                       71


16.5. Members Retired. The approving authority notifies the FSO to prepare the refund
documentation if the member's address is known. The refund voucher must be properly
supported by the document authorizing the refund. If the member's address is not known, obtain
a current mailing address from the FSO at or from DFAS and notify the FSO accordingly. Do
not transfer the file to DFAS for refund action.
16.6. Losses Discovered After Personnel Leave the Air Force. While this type of situation
should not occur if property records were properly cleared prior to a an officer, NCO, or civilian
separating from the Air Force, on occasion, they do. This paragraph applies to persons who
separated from the Air Force and are not receiving any pay from the Air Force. In these
situations, an after the fact ROS should be processed and an attempt made to obtain
reimbursement for the lost, damaged, or destroyed property in the same manner that a ROS
would be processed if the person was still on an Air Force payroll. In processing this type of
ROS, unit commanders, appointing, and approving authorities should consider taking action
against supervisors who might have been negligent in performing their duties. See paragraph
21.4.

                                            Chapter 17

                    RECONSIDERATIONS, APPEALS, AND WAIVERS

17.1. General. After action has been taken by the approving authority on a determination of
liability under the provisions of this manual, a ROS is not reopened, corrected, or altered in any
manner except as provided in this chapter.
17.2. Requests for Reconsideration. The approving authority who took action on the ROS
may consider requests for reconsideration. Such action may consist of:
   17.2.1. Minor Corrections. Minor corrections, which do not involve important changes in
   findings or recommendations of investigating officials or in the action of appointing or
   approving authorities, can usually be made by the program manager who has the original
   ROS on file. Corresponding corrections should be made on all other copies.
   17.2.2. Cancellation. Cancellation of a finalized ROS that was used to adjust property
   control records is seldom necessary or desirable; however, the approving authority who took
   action may cancel the original ROS if circumstances warrant, such as duplicate ROS;
   discovery of items previously reported as lost; and a ROS erroneously initiated to cover
   property belonging to activities other than the Air Force. The approving authority canceling
   a ROS notifies each activity on distribution and ensures that any adjustment action taken is
   reversed. Canceled and regular ROS are kept for six years as prescribed in paragraph 11.6.
   17.2.3. New Evidence. If new evidence or information becomes available, the approving
   authority or higher headquarters may reopen a ROS. Amending action may be taken with or
   without reinvestigation; however, the approving authority may direct the investigating officer
   or may appoint a financial liability officer to make whatever additional investigation has
   been directed or is appropriate. Upon completion of the additional investigation, the ROS is
   resubmitted through original channels to the approving authority taking previous action. If
   the approving authority taking the previous action determines that further investigation by an
   investigating or financial liability officer is not necessary, additional corrective action may be
   indicated on the ROS immediately or, if desired, after additional information or evidence has
   been evaluated. Notice of corrective action on a ROS must be communicated through proper
   channels to all offices having copies.
   17.2.4. Property Recovered Is Damaged. When property believed to be lost and dropped
   from property records by an approved ROS is later found but is damaged, the original ROS
   will be canceled and a new ROS initiated to:
       17.2.4.1. Establish responsibility for the damage.
       17.2.4.2. Establish financial liability, if warranted.
       17.2.4.3. Establish monetary loss or cost of repair.
       17.2.4.4. Dispose of unserviceable property.
17.3. Appeals. A person held financially liable may appeal the findings of a ROS.
   17.3.1. The appeal must be submitted in writing, and specifically state the alleged errors or
   injustices occurring during the survey process. A member may seek legal assistance in
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                     73


   preparing an appeal. (A request for reconsideration based on new evidence is processed in
   accordance with paragraph 17.2.3 and is not considered an appeal.)
   17.3.2. Appeals must be submitted to the approving authority within 30 days of the date the
   individual charged is originally notified of the assessed liability; however, in cases where
   assessed financial liability exceeds one month's basic pay, the written intent to appeal must
   be submitted to the approving authority within 30 days and the appeal must be submitted
   within 60 days.
17.4. Debt Collection Actions.
   17.4.1. If an individual submits an appeal, the ROS program manager notifies the
   individual's servicing FSO to suspend collection of the debt.
   17.4.2. If an individual is scheduled for impending separation or resignation before an
   appeal can be ruled on, collection of the debt will be made; however, if the appeal is
   approved, the person(s) will be reimbursed.
17.5. ROS Appeal Procedures When the Approving Authority is in an Organization Below
MAJCOM Level.
   17.5.1. If the wing/installation approving authority grants the appeal, it is returned to the
   ROS program manager who annotates the survey register, notifies the individual, and the
   individual's servicing FSO of the successful appeal. The FSO cancels the indebtedness on
   the individual's pay account. If collection was already made, the amount collected is
   refunded to the individual in the same manner as for erroneous collections. No further action
   is required on the appeal.
   17.5.2. If the wing/installation approving authority denies the appeal, either in whole or in
   part, the program manager notifies the individual and sends the complete file to the next
   higher commander who takes action as outlined in Chapter 12.
       17.5.3. If the next higher commander approves the appeal, it is returned to originating
       wing/installation for closure action; however, if the appeal is denied, the next higher
       commander forwards it to the MAJCOM commander who takes final action "By
       Authority of the Secretary of the Air Force." This paragraph assumes that there is only
       one "next higher commander" between the wing and the MAJCOM. If there are more
       than one, then the ROS is forwarded through command channels. All intermediate
       commands must be advised of actions taken by higher headquarters so that their suspense
       files may be cleared.
   17.5.4. Any commander acting on a ROS appeal may exercise the discretionary options
   addressed in paragraph 8.6.
17.6. Preparation of ROS Files for Forwarding.
   17.6.1. The appeal file sent by the wing/installation approving authority will contain the
   following papers in duplicate:
       17.6.1.1. A transmittal letter with the following attachments:
          17.6.1.1.1. The appeal.
 74                                   AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


          17.6.1.1.2. DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss, and
          supporting documents, if any.
          17.6.1.1.3. A statement indicating the reasons for denying the appeal.
          17.6.1.1.4. A STATEMENT WHICH RESPONDS TO EACH CONTENTION
          OR ALLEGATION RAISED BY THE APPELLANT.
          17.6.1.1.5. A statement of whether or not damaged property will be repaired. (This
          is needed only when liability is based on estimated repair costs and the damaged
          property has not been repaired.)
          17.6.1.1.6. Appellant's mailing address.
          17.6.1.1.7. Any additional information that would assist the next higher commander
          in ruling on the appeal.
          17.6.1.1.8. A statement of whether or not an amount was already collected from an
          appellant and collection and, or payroll deduction voucher number, if applicable.
17.7. MAJCOM Actions and Appeals From Subordinate Headquarters.
   17.7.1. If the MAJCOM commander grants the appeal, the file is returned directly to the
   originating wing/installation commander for processing action by the program manger;
   however, the MAJCOM will advise the intermediate headquarters of this action so that their
   suspense files can be closed.
   17.7.2. If the MAJCOM denies the appeal, either in whole or in part, the file is returned
   directly to the originating wing/installation commander, who notifies the individual and
   pursues collection via the individual's FSO. The MAJCOM's appeal action is final and no
   further appeal may be considered. It is taken "By Authority of The Secretary of the Air
   Force."
   17.7.3. Actions on ROS Appeals Originating at MAJCOM level. If the MAJCOM
   commander is the approving authority and the appeal is denied, the MAJCOM commander
   sends the appeal to HQ USAF/LGS, who takes final action "By Authority of the Secretary of
   the Air Force". The transmittal consists of the same documents as prescribed in paragraph
   17.6 above.
17.8. Housing Damage Waivers. Approving authorities may waive all or part of the assessed
liability for damage to government accommodations based on the circumstances in the case.
Details are outlined in Chapter 19.
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                       75


                                          Chapter 18

                             ROS PERTAINING TO VEHICLES

18.1. General. This chapter provides guidance relating to damage to private conveyances,
rental vehicles, and government owned vehicles. For the purposes of this manual, a vehicle is
considered to be any piece of equipment that moves on a solid surface either under its own
power, towed, or pushed and is used to move people or things. A vehicle can be mounted on
wheels, tracked treads, or runners and be of commercial or military design. The following are
examples of vehicles; however, it is not an all inclusive list: sedans; pick-up and cargo trucks;
prime movers; trailers; motorcycles; tracked vehicles; manual or motor operated cranes; snow
mobiles; aircraft cargo loaders; hand operated or mechanized warehouse material handling
equipment, such as warehouse tractors and trailers, forklift trucks, cranes, stackers which may be
manually or computer controlled, and any other type of mechanized materials handling item.
This list compliments the definitions of a vehicle in Joint Publication 1-02, DOD Dictionary of
Military and Associated Terms, and Webster's Dictionary.
18.2. Damage Involving Private Conveyances. Damage to Air Force property resulting from
operation of privately owned vehicles, boats, airplanes, or other conveyances is not generally
subject to the ROS process. Claims, or administrative action against responsible individuals are
usually pursued under AFI 51-501 (Tort Claims) and other regulations. If Air Force members or
employees are involved, a ROS may be processed instead of asserting a tort claim for the
damage to Air Force property. These actions must be coordinated with the legal office.
18.3. Damage to Rental Vehicles.
   18.3.1. A ROS is initiated in accordance with paragraph 18.4 for damage to General
   Services Administration (GSA) vehicles and commercial rental vehicles under Air Force
   control. (Commercial rental vehicles are under Air Force control when an Air Force
   contracting officer enters into a written agreement with a commercial rental vehicle company
   to make vehicles available for government use.)
   18.3.2. Damage to vehicles rented by members and employees directly from commercial
   companies is not subject to the provisions of this manual, regardless of whether or not the
   rental was authorized on government orders.
18.4. ROS Guidance and Procedures for Government Vehicles.
   18.4.1. General.
       18.4.1.1. When to Process a Vehicle ROS. Paragraph 18.4 provides guidance on when a
       ROS is processed and when financial liability can be imposed on Air Force members and
       employees in cases involving the loss, damage or destruction of government vehicles.
       More significantly, in cases involving government vehicles, the standard used for
       processing ROS and imposing financial liability is gross negligence, willful misconduct,
       or deliberate unauthorized use.
       18.4.1.2. Rationale for the "Gross Negligence" Guidance. The "gross negligence"
       criterion has been adopted to eliminate the significant expenditure of resources to process
       reports of survey for little monetary return to the Government, and to more equitably
       distribute the risk of liability associated with government vehicle damage. Past practices

     had resulted in unfairly charging the vehicle operators (normally the most junior airmen
     and civilian employees) for motor vehicle damage, which is commonly recognized as a
     normal cost of doing business. However, the gross negligence standard does not preclude
     a commander from taking other administrative or disciplinary actions against individuals
     who damage government vehicles. See paragraph 18.4.2.3.
  18.4.2. Overall Guidance.
     18.4.2.1. When a Vehicle ROS Is Required. A ROS must be processed in all loss,
     damage, or destruction cases if there is evidence of gross negligence, willful misconduct,
     deliberate unauthorized use, or if property records must be adjusted.
     18.4.2.2. Assigning Financial Liability. Air Force members and employees can be held
     financially liable only in those cases in which the loss or damage to government motor
     vehicles was proximately caused by the member's or employee's gross negligence, willful
     misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use.
     18.4.2.3. Punishments and Administrative Actions. The fact that a ROS was not
     processed or financial liability was not imposed on the person responsible for the vehicle
     damage does not prevent the commander from taking other action against the responsible
     person. These actions include, but are not limited to, punitive action under the UCMJ,
     disciplinary action under AFI 36-704, (Discipline and Adverse Actions), verbal or written
     reprimands, verbal or written counseling, remarks in performance evaluations, non-
     judicial punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ, or other appropriate administrative
     action.
  18.4.3. Implementing Instructions.
     18.4.3.1. Appointing Investigating Officers. When a vehicle is lost, damaged, or
     destroyed, the "approving or appointing authority" or the commander of the organization
     that has possession of the vehicle will appoint an investigating officer who will ascertain
     the facts in the case and make a recommendation to the "approving or appointing
     authority" on whether or not processing a ROS is required. This also applies to vehicles
     that may be deployed or issued on hand receipt to individuals outside of the owning
     organization. General procedures for processing a ROS are contained in Chapter 4.
     Investigating officer duties are described in Chapter 7. Time frames for processing a
     ROS are addressed in Chapter 5.
         18.4.3.1.1. (Added-RAMSTEINAB) Determination for processing a vehicle ROS
         will be accomplished by completing the Damaged Vehicle Preliminary Investigation
         (DVPI) Form. The DVPI will be completed by the appointed IO and reviewed by
         Unit/CC and the 86 LRG Appointing Authority.
     18.4.3.2. Requirement for Impartial Investigating Officers.       Generally, the
     squadron vehicle control officer or vehicle control NCO cannot be appointed as
     investigating officers because, in most cases involving damaged vehicles, these
     individuals do not meet the "disinterested" or "impartial" requirement necessary
     for investigating officers. See paragraph 7.1.2.
     18.4.3.3. Vehicle Accident Reports. A motor vehicle accident investigation report
     prepared by security police personnel, civilian law enforcement authorities, or
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                    77


     transportation/vehicle control officers may be used by the investigating officer to
     determine whether there is evidence of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or
     deliberate unauthorized use. The accident investigation report can be used for this
     purpose only if it thoroughly documents the facts and circumstances of the damage.
     18.4.3.4. Other Accident Investigations. If an accident investigation report was not
     accomplished, has insufficient information, or leaves doubt that all facts have been
     presented, then the investigating officer must conduct an investigation to determine all
     facts and circumstances of the damage.
     18.4.3.5. Investigating Officer's Recommendations. After reviewing the facts and
     circumstances of the damage, the investigating officer must make a written
     recommendation to the "approving or the appointing authority" as to whether or not a
     ROS is required. The investigating officer will provide a copy to the ROS program
     manager. After considering the investigating officer's recommendation, the "approving
     or the appointing authority" makes the final decision on whether or not a ROS will be
     processed. The ROS program manager will be advised of this decision.
     18.4.3.5. (RAMSTEINAB) After completing the DVPI, the 86 LRG Appointing
     Authority will review the IO and Unit/CC recommendations and make the final
     determination on whether or not a ROS will be required. A copy of the DVPI Form with
     recommendation will be given to the LRS ROS Program Manager. The ROS Program
     Manager is responsible for maintaining a copy of the completed DVPI Form.
        18.4.3.5.1. Recommendation Not to Process a ROS. If the facts and circumstances
        clearly indicate the absence of gross negligence, willful misconduct or deliberate
        unauthorized use, the investigating officer makes a written recommendation to the
        "approving or the appointing authority" that a ROS is not required and no financial
        liability should be imposed; however, if property records must be adjusted, a ROS
        must be processed. The investigating officer provides a copy of the recommendation
        to the ROS program manager.
        18.4.3.5.2. Recommendation that a ROS Be Processed.                If the facts and
        circumstances indicate the presence of gross negligence, willful misconduct or
        deliberate unauthorized use, or if property records must be adjusted, the investigating
        officer makes a recommendation to the "approving or the appointing authority" that a
        ROS is required and should be processed. The investigating officer provides a copy
        of this recommendation to the ROS program manager.
     18.4.3.6. Withdrawing O&M Funds. Whether or not a ROS is processed under the
     procedures set forth in Chapter 4, wing or installation commanders should consider
     withdrawing operation and maintenance (O&M) funds from the unit to which the
     responsible individual is assigned and transferring these funds to the organization that
     must repair the damage. See paragraph 2.3.5, Penalizing Units Whose Members Abuse
     Property.
     18.4.3.7. Unit Reviews of Accident Records and Program Managers' Trend Data. This
     sub-paragraph requires action by commanders or approving authorities, organizations
     which have accidents, and program managers. It has two purposes.
78                               AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


     18.4.3.7.1. The first is to ensure that commanders of units involved in accidents
     review their loss, damage, or destruction data so that corrective action may be taken
     to prevent recurrences, to ensure a ROS is processed when required, and cases are
     reviewed to determine if disciplinary or administrative action should be taken against
     the individuals involved in the accidents.
     18.4.3.7.2. The second is to enable the ROS program manager to develop trend data
     which can be presented to the commander or the approving authority. To gather this
     information, the program manager will make an entry on the AF Form 453 indicating
     that an accident occurred. It also will provide a reason why a ROS was not
     processed. It is a base or MAJCOM responsibility to prescribe the type of
     information that will satisfy the trend data requirement.
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                          79


                                            Chapter 19

                     ROS PERTAINING TO GOVERNMENT HOUSING

19.1. General. Paragraph 0707 of the DoDR cited in paragraph 1.2.2 of this manual outlines
DoD policy pertaining to government housing liability. Some portions of paragraph 0707 are
included in this chapter that prescribes the liability of military personnel for the loss, damage, or
destruction of government housing (family housing or unaccompanied personnel housing). It
also describes minimum requirements for assessing financial liability when government housing,
including equipment or furnishings therein, is lost, damaged or destroyed. Government housing
within the scope of this chapter includes both permanent and temporary quarters either owned
by, or controlled by, the U.S. Government.
19.2. Determination of Proximate Cause. A member of a Military Service shall be held liable
to the United States for the loss, damage or destruction of family housing or an unaccompanied
personnel housing unit assigned to a member, including equipment and furnishings therein, when
a determination is made that the loss, damage or destruction was proximately caused by the
abuse or negligence of the member, a dependent of the member, or a guest either of the member
or the member's dependent.
19.3. Financial Liability of Occupants. Financial liability against personnel for loss, damage
or destruction of government housing, including equipment and furnishings is assessed for the
full amount of the loss if the loss, damage or destruction was proximately caused by gross
negligence or abuse. Liability of occupants for damage to government housing and related
equipment and furnishings is prescribed in 10 U.S.C. Section 2775 and DoD 4165.63-M.
19.4. Determination of Negligence. Determinations must be made on whether the loss or
damage to government housing was proximately caused by simple or gross negligence or abuse
of the member, the member's dependents, or guests of either.
   19.4.1. When the proximate cause of the loss or damage is determined to be gross
   negligence or abuse, the financial liability of the member is for the total amount of the loss to
   the government. Where a member's dependent or guest causes a loss or damage through
   gross negligence or abuse, the member is fully liable for the loss or damage if the member
   was "on notice" of the particular risk involved and failed to exercise reasonable, available
   opportunities to prevent or limit the loss or damage.In the absence of evidence to the
   contrary, the member is presumed to have been "on notice" of any risks attending the
   activities of family members and guest(s) on the premises.
   19.4.2. Where simple negligence is determined to be the proximate cause of the loss or
   damage, the financial liability of the member is limited to an amount equal to basic pay for
   one month at the rate in effect at the time of the loss, or the amount of the loss, whichever is
   less.
   19.4.3. A member is liable for damages to or failure to satisfactorily clean any assigned
   family housing or unaccompanied personnel housing unit (including loss or damage to
   equipment and furnishings therein) if a ROS determines that the loss or damage was caused
   by the member's negligence or deliberate unauthorized use of such unit.
 80                                   AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


   19.4.4. ROS on members who damage nonassigned quarters are subject to the guidance
   contained in paragraphs 19.1 through 19.3. If both assigned and nonassigned quarters are
   damaged in the same incident, a member may be held liable for damage to assigned quarters,
   and may also be held liable for damage to nonassigned quarters up to one month's basic pay.
   Under these circumstances, total liability for all quarters damaged in a single incident may
   not exceed one month's basic pay, unless gross negligence or willful misconduct is involved.
   19.4.5. If assigned quarters and personal or organizational equipment are damaged in the
   same incident, a member may be held liable for quarters damage and may also be held liable
   for damage to the personal or organizational equipment.
19.5. Responsibility for Submitting a ROS. The civil engineer (CE) is responsible for
preparing a ROS applicable to housing damage because the CE is both the custodian and the
accountable officer for the housing and the contents. This is different from the normal
equipment item that is on the accountable records of one person but another organization or
person in that organization has custodial responsibility for the item. For these items the unit
commander (custodian) prepares the ROS.
19.6. Waiver Provisions - Housing Damage. 10 U.S.C. Section 2775 provides for waiver of
liability arising under conditions in paragraphs 19.1 through 19.3. The waiver applies to both
family housing and unaccompanied personnel housing. The Secretary of the Air Force may
waive an uncollected claim of the United States if he or his designee, based upon the unique
circumstances of an individual case, determines that the waiver of the claim is in the best
interests of the United States. This authority is delegated to the ROS approving and appellate
authorities. Detailed procedures follow.
19.7. Waiver Consideration for Housing Damage. Liability resulting from damage to
assigned family housing or unaccompanied housing (including equipment and furnishings
therein) is subject to waiver by the ROS approving authority. Liability may be waived, in whole
or in part, by the approving authority if, based upon the unique circumstances of an individual
case, it is determined that the waiver is in the best interest of the Untied States.
   19.7.1. Factors To Be Considered. In determining whether or not liability should be waived
   by the approving authority, factors to be considered may include, but are not limited to the
   following:
       19.7.1.1. Degree of abuse or negligence involved.
       19.7.1.2. Where damage was caused by a dependent or guest, whether or not the member
       or the member's spouse was on notice of the activities in question and exercised available
       opportunities for preventing or limiting the damage, or otherwise exercised proper control
       over dependents or guests.
       19.7.1.3. The extent, if any, to which involuntary collection would cause substantial
       financial hardship, constitute a clear injustice, or adversely impact unit morale and
       discipline.
       19.7.1.4. Available government remedies against other culpable persons, and the relative
       culpability of all persons whose actions or omissions contributed to the damage or loss.
       19.7.1.5. Any prior instances of abusive or negligent conduct toward government
       property.
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                        81


     19.7.1.6. In overseas areas, the unavailability of private insurance to cover the liability of
     individuals who would normally be insurable in the United States.
  19.7.2. Waiver Procedures. A member may specifically request a waiver and provide
  support for the request in writing. In the absence of such a request, the approving authority
  still considers the appropriateness of granting a waiver based on the information in the ROS.
     19.7.2.1. Individual Charged. Once a member has been notified that charges are being
     considered for damage to government housing, he or she is advised of certain options
     available. One of these options is to submit a fully substantiated waiver request to the
     approving authority. If the member elects to request waiver, it is submitted to the ROS
     program manager at the same time the DD Form 200 (with block 16 completed) is
     returned to the program manager.
     19.7.2.2. If waiver request is received along with the DD Form 200 (with block 16
     completed), the program manager sends the waiver and the DD Form 200 through the
     appointing authority to the approving authority.
     19.7.2.3. The appointing authority takes no action on the waiver, sending the waiver
     request to the approving authority with the DD Form 200 (after completing block 13).
     While the appointing authority has no active role in waiver determinations, he or she may
     direct that corrections be made if policies and procedures relating to waivershave not
     been adhered to.
     19.7.2.4. Approving Authority. If the approving authority has assessed financial
     liability, he or she immediately decides whether or not to waiver that liability by
     considering the factors in Chapter 17. A wavier is considered regardless of whether or
     not a member specifically requests a waiver. If the approving authority waives the
     liability in full, disposition is the same as for relief of liability. The program manager
     advises member and the FSO that the debt is canceled. If the approving authority does
     not waive the liability in full, the member is so notified and is advised of what further
     options for relief are available.
     19.7.2.5. Upon receipt of an adverse waiver determination, a member may appeal the
     determination of liability under procedures in paragraph 17.3, or request further waiver
     consideration by the MAJCOM commander. These options must be exercised within 30
     days of the date the member is notified of the assessment of liability. The options must
     be elected concurrently, and not sequentially, within 30 days, and the election may not be
     changed except to withdraw an option. If either or both options are elected, the following
     procedures apply:
         19.7.2.5.1. If a member appeals a determination of liability under procedures in
         paragraph 17.3, and also requests further waiver consideration by the MAJCOM
         commander, the two actions are considered concurrently. The approving authority
         considers the appeal of the assessment of liability. If the appeal is denied, the entire
         appeal and waiver package is sent to the MAJCOM commander for final action on the
         appeal and the waiver. The MAJCOM commander first considers the appeal, and, if
         denied, immediately considers the waiver.
         19.7.2.5.2. If a member elects to submit an appeal only, procedures in paragraph 17.3
         apply.
 82                                   AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


          19.7.2.5.3. If a member elects to only request a waiver, the approving authority
          reviews the ROS file. If the waiver request is disapproved, the case is sent to the next
          higher headquarters for action on the waiver. The waiver package consists of the
          same documentation as in paragraph 17.3 substituting "waiver" for "appeal."
      19.7.2.6. If the MAJCOM commander waives the liability in full, the file is returned to
      the wing approving authority for action by the ROS program manager who annotates the
      survey register and notifies the individual and the individual's servicing FSO of the
      waiver. The FSO cancels the outstanding indebtedness on the individual's pay account.
      Because the waiver authority only relates to outstanding claims of the United States, any
      amount of a housing damage debt collected before the waiver is requested may not be
      refunded.
      19.7.2.7. If the MAJCOM commander does not waive the liability in full, the file is
      returned to the base for action by the ROS program manager, who notifies the individual
      and pursues collection via the individual's servicing FSO. If part of the liability is
      waived, the FSO reduces the debt and collects the remaining amount.
      19.7.2.8. Waiver determinations made by the MAJCOM commander are final.
          19.7.2.8.1. If liability is not waived in full by the MAJCOM commander, an enlisted
          member may request remission by HQ USAF/LGS, using the Air Force procedures
          and criteria established under 10 U.S.C. Section 9837.
          19.7.2.8.2. Officers may request waiver consideration by the Secretary of the Air
          Force under the authority of 10 U.S.C. Section 2775, but the procedures and criteria
          used in considering such a waiver are those established by the Air Force under 10
          U.S.C. Section 9837. That is, enlisted and officers both use remission channels rather
          than ROS channels to obtain consideration by the Secretary of the Air Force. AFM
          177-373, volume I, applies.
      19.7.2.9. In cases where the MAJCOM commander is the approving authority on the
      ROS and the waiver is denied, the MAJCOM commander sends the waiver request to HQ
      USAF/LGS for consideration. HQ USAF/LGS follows procedures that are similar to
      those for the MAJCOM commander.
19.8. Action and Processing of Housing Liability Waivers.
   19.8.1. Waiver requests can be processed through channels from the wing/installation
   commander to the next higher commander. In these cases the next higher commander takes
   one of two actions.
      19.8.1.1. Takes final action disapproving the waiver request "By Authority of the
      Secretary of the Air Force," if the MAJCOM has authorized this by written delegation of
      authority.
      19.8.1.2. Forwards the waiver request to the next higher commander, probably the
      MAJCOM, for action if the commander above wing level has not been given disapproval
      authority.
   19.8.2. MAJCOM Actions.
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                  83


     19.8.2.1. The MAJCOM commander takes final disapproval action "By Authority of the
     Secretary of the Air Force" on waiver requests where liability was not waived by lower-
     level organizations.
     19.8.2.2. If the MAJCOM commander was the approving authority on the ROS for
     which a waiver request was submitted, and does not waive the liability, sends the waiver
     request to HQ USAF/LGS for final action.
     19.8.2.3. USAF/LGS takes final action "By Authority of the Secretary of the Air Force"
     on waiver requests where liability is not waived by the MAJCOM commander.

                                           Chapter 20

                      SUPPLY SYSTEM AND PETROLEUM STOCKS

20.1. General. This chapter applies to Air Force property defined as "supply system stocks"
and contains procedures to be followed when discrepancies are discovered. Retail bulk
petroleum stocks also are addressed. Supply system stocks are those inventories where a stock
record account is required to be maintained, showing by item the receipt, issue, and disposal of
property, the balances on hand, and such other identifying or stock control data as may be
required. This includes in-stores wholesale and retail inventories financed by stock funds and
other appropriations for issue to end-use customers. Wholesale stocks are the responsibility of
Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).
20.2. Guidance. Accountable officers for supply system stocks are liable for the full amount of
the loss, damage, or destruction of property for which they are accountable when the loss,
damage, or destruction is proximately caused by their negligence, willful misconduct, or
deliberate unauthorized use. Liability for the full amount is addressed in paragraph C.4.6. of the
DoD directive cited in paragraph 1.2.
20.3. DoD Supply System Stocks Procedures. The following is an extract of the DoD
Regulation cited in paragraph 1.2.2 as it pertains to supply system stocks and is provided for
guidance.
       “0708 SUPPLY SYSTEM MATERIEL
               “070801. Purpose. This section applies to personal property defined as "supply
           system materiel" and contains procedures to be followed when inventory losses are
           discovered. The provisions of this chapter are applicable to all activities accountable
           for supply system materiel including stock fund and other inventories (e.g.,
           appropriated fund, industrial fund, etc.).
              “070802. Inventory. Physical inventories shall be taken in accordance with the
           provisions contained in this Regulation and DoD Instruction 4140.35 "Physical
           Inventory Control for DoD Supply System Material."
                      “A. Discrepancies. Despite the safeguards established by DoD
                Components in the care and maintenance of supply system stocks,
                discrepancies may occur between stock record balances and materiel in
                storage. These discrepancies are subject to postcount validation, preadjustment
                research, and causative research, as prescribed in chapter 7 of DoD 4000.25-2-
                M, "Military Standard Transaction Reporting and Accounting Procedures
                (MILSTRAP)."
                      “B. Adjustments. An adjustment shall be made to the inventory and
                financial records to bring those records into balance after appropriate research.
                Care should be taken to process the transactions correctly (e.g., an issue posted
                twice should be corrected by a reversal (credit transaction), not as a loss of
                inventory). These types of corrected discrepancies are referred to as resolved
                discrepancies. For unresolved inventory losses, an inventory adjustment
                document or a DD Form 200 shall be used to substantiate adjusting the
AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011                                                   85


           inventory and accounting records to the stock on hand and to provide relief
           from property accountability or responsibility.

                “C. Causative Research
                         “1. Causative research shall be conducted for all inventory
                discrepancies that meet any of the criteria specified in DoD 4000.25-2-M,
                "Military Standard Transaction Reporting and Accounting Procedures
                (MILSTRAP)." For inventory discrepancies which do not meet the
                criteria for performing causative research, a justification for adjusting the
                inventory and accounting records and relief from property accountability
                shall be provided by means of an inventory adjustment document in
                accordance with section D. below.
                         “2. One of the purposes of this research is to either establish
                liability or provide relief from accountability for the accountable and/or
                responsible officer(s) for the loss, damage or destruction of supply
                system materiel.
                        “3. Another purpose of the research is to determine if the loss to
                the government was proximately caused by the negligence or abuse of
                individuals. If an individual accepts responsibility for the loss, damage
                or destruction of supply system materiel and voluntarily reimburses the
                government, a DD Form 200 is not required. The collection voucher may
                be used to adjust the financial and property records.

           When authorized, the reviewing authority may approve physical inventory
           adjustments equal to or less than $50,000, when negligence or abuse is not
           evident or suspected. When negligence or abuse is evident or suspected, the
           reviewing authority initiates and forwards the DD Form 200 to the appointing
           authority for action. The financial liability investigation shall be used to
           substantiate adjusting the stock record, and providing relief from property
           accountability.

                     “A. Accountability and Responsibility. For unresolved inventory losses
                which meet the criteria set forth in paragraphs 070806 and 070807, above, a
                DD Form 200 is required to relieve accountable or responsible officers from
                responsibility, to substantiate adjustment of the inventory and accounting
                records to the inventory on hand, and to identify problem areas or trends for
                corrective actions. A financial liability investigation should be conducted by a
                person who is not directly supervised by the accountable or responsible
                officer. It shall include, as a minimum, the following actions:
                    “1. Review and evaluate existing procedures for their adequacy in
              protecting property.
                     “2. Determine compliance with prescribed regulations and procedures.
                    “3. Determine who is involved and what responsibilities they have been
              assigned.
                     “4. Determine whether negligence or abuse is evident.
                     “5. Review of causative research conducted.
                     “6. Determine the cause or the probable cause of the inventory loss.
                     “7. Recommend actions to minimize recurrence of the inventory loss.
             “B. Review the Adequacy of Procedures in Protecting Property.
                     “1. Physical Security Review. Determine if storage facilities are adequate
              to ensure proper safeguarding of all items, especially those items that are
              sensitive, classified, or subject to pilferage. The review should include an
              evaluation of compliance with regulatory requirements, procedures to determine
              degree of susceptibility of items to theft or pilferage, and lessons to be learned
              from losses that have been experienced.
                     “2. Receipt, Storage, and Shipment Procedures Review. Determine if
              adequate procedures exist to prevent loss from theft or pilferage during receipt,
              storage, or shipment. The degree of protection should be commensurate with
              statutory and regulatory requirements, the degree of susceptibility to theft or
              pilferage, and experienced losses.
              “C. Determine Procedural Compliance. Determine if the responsible persons
           have complied with existing procedures to protect Government property. If they
           have not complied with the procedures, determine if they failed to comply or were
           instructed not to comply.”
20.4. Air Force Procedures Implementing DoD Policy.
   20.4.1. Discrepancies in supply system stocks may occur between stock record account
   balances and materiel in storage. DLA will investigate these discrepancies to determine the
   reason for the out-of-balance condition. If the initial investigation reveals that the
 88                                   AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


   discrepancy is the result of a paperwork or posting error, make an accounting adjustment to
   bring the appropriate records into balance. Accounting adjustments are prescribed in AFI 33-
   112.
   20.4.2. If the initial investigation does not identify the cause of the discrepancy and if the
   discrepancy does not meet the requirements for a mandatory ROS (Chapter 3), use an
   inventory adjustment document to adjust the stock record account.
   20.4.3. If the initial investigation does not identify the cause of the discrepancy and the
   discrepancy meets the requirement for a ROS, a further investigation must be conducted by
   disinterested person addressed in Chapter 7. Document the results of the investigation on
   DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss. Use the ROS to
   substantiate adjustment of the stock record account, to recommend corrective action, and to
   determine the financial responsibility of the accountable officer or any other person involved
   in the discrepancy. The suspense copy of DD Form 200 can be used to adjust the inventory
   control record pending receipt of the approved DD Form 200.
   20.4.4. As a minimum, the investigation will cover the requirements listed in the DoD
   paragraph 070808 contained in paragraph 20.3.
20.5. Corrective Action Statement. In cases where the investigation determines any type of
deficiency in the control of or accounting for property, a statement must be made in block 10,
DD Form 200, on the action taken to prevent recurrence of the discrepancy.
20.6. Accountable Officer Signature. DD Form 200, block 17e, Accountable Officer, must be
signed by the local inventory manager having accountability for supply system stocks (for
example, chief of supply, base fuels management officer, medical supply officer, etc.).
20.7. Reviewing Authority Signature. For supply system stocks, DD Form 200, block 12f,
must be signed by the reviewing authority.
20.8. Retail Bulk Petroleum Losses.
   20.8.1. Except for minor changes, the following is extracted from paragraph 0709,
   "Petroleum Product/Losses" contained in DoD Reference cited in paragraph 1.2.2.
       20.8.1.1. Loss Expectancy. Some losses are unavoidable in the handling and storage of
       volatile products. These losses can be controlled by management actions to limit the
       rates of loss for such products so that standards are not exceeded. For this reason,
       volume II, chapter 10, of DoD 4140.25-M, Management of Bulk Petroleum Products,
       Storage and Distribution Facilities, provides authorized loss allowances to accommodate
       product losses normally expected. Categories of losses are defined in volume II, chapter
       11, of DoD 4140.25-M.
       20.8.1.2. Any trends, such as a pattern of losses within the allowable percentage, require
       further research and investigation. These losses shall be researched and reported in
       accordance with section 0708 of the DoD procedure.

                                           Chapter 21

                  ROS PERTAINING TO PROPERTY RECORD ITEMS

21.1. General. This chapter applies to Air Force property defined as "property record items"
and contains procedures to be followed when discrepancies are found.Property record items
includes all Air Force accountable property other than supply system stocks, which are addressed
in Chapter 20. Definitions of property record items are in paragraph 21.3. Property record items
are not mentioned by DoD in the references cited in paragraph 1.2.
21.2. Guidance. A ROS is normally required for property record items lost, damaged, or
destroyed. There are situations when a ROS is mandatory and other situations when one is not
prepared. See Chapter 3 that outlines when a ROS is or is not required.
21.3. Definition of Property Record Items. This category of property includes the following
DoD definitions:
   21.3.1. Military Real Property. Lands, buildings, structures, utilities systems, and
   improvements and appurtenances thereto. It includes equipment attached to and made part of
   buildings and structures (such as plant equipment). Also, it includes installed equipment,
   such as fixed overhead crane runways, elevators, lavatories, plumbing, and electrical
   systems. Machine tools and production equipment are not included under this category.
   21.3.2. Military Personal Property. Accountable property of any kind except real property as
   defined above, supply system stocks, and tools used or capable of use in the manufacture of
   supplies or in the performance of services or for any administrative or general plant
   purposed.
   21.3.3. Inventories Held in Industrial Funds. Property of the Department of Defense
   consisting of raw materials, supplies, and work in process held in all industrial funds.
   21.3.4. Weapons and Other Military Equipment in Use. Equipment that generally comprises
   items of materiel assigned to using units and includes all major weapons and supporting
   equipment. Examples of equipment are aircraft, missiles, tanks, combat vehicles,
   communications, and electronics systems, heavy support equipment, ships, service draft
   boats, floating derricks, harbor tugs, and ammunition.
   21.3.5. Plant Equipment. Property of a capital nature (consisting of machinery, equipment,
   furniture, vehicles, machine tools, accessory and auxiliary items, but excluding special
   tooling), and used or capable of use in the manufacture of supplies, or in the performance of
   services, or for any administrative, or general plant purposes.
   21.3.6. Excess, Surplus, and Foreign Excess Personal Property. Personal property on which
   disposal action has been initiated by the DoD component. It may have come from supply
   system inventories or from equipment in use. In either case, accountability is dropped at the
   time of transfer from the owning agency to the property disposal agency.
   21.3.7. Government Furnished Property (GFM). GFM is described in the Federal
   Acquisition Regulation (FAR), part 45. Examples of such equipment are aircraft engines,
   electronic systems, and other parts that are furnished to a contractor by contracting offices for
   incorporation into an airplane, ship, or other weapon system. The contracting officer to
 90                                   AFMAN23-220_RAMSTEINABSUP_I 27 JULY 2011


   whom the contractor is assigned is responsible for complying with the applicable provisions
   of the FAR.
21.4. Losses Resulting From Non-Compliance With Account Transfer Procedures Upon
Change of Custodians.
   21.4.1. AFMAN 67-1 (AFMAN 23-110), Volume II, prescribes procedures to follow when
   property custodians are changed. They require that a joint inventory be conducted by the old
   and the new custodian, that any missing items be recorded, that a copy of the property record
   balance signed by the new custodian be provided to the old custodian, and that in cases of a
   PCS, the clearance record of the outgoing custodian be initialed to indicate the custodian's
   account is clear and that the custodian can comply with the PCS orders.
   21.4.2. If the custodial records are not in compliance with existing procedures, the clearance
   record will not be signed and, unless the wing/installation commander directs otherwise, the
   PCS will be held up until the custodial records are properly processed.
   21.4.3. If the custodial records are incorrect and property is unaccounted for because of non-
   compliance with custodial transfer procedures, the custodians, any supervisors, or other
   personnel directly involved in the transfer or who are responsible to see that proper
   procedures were followed will be considered contributorially negligent when the ROS is
   investigated because they created or condoned conditions or practices which favored the loss
   or damage of property.
   21.4.4. These procedures are not applicable to transfer of custodianship in theaters of
   operations or in combat situations unless implemented by the wing/installation commander.

   United States property. All commanders are responsible for government real and personal
   property under their control.
   22.2.2. Financial liability for the loss, damage, or destruction of United States property
   issued to the ANG is assessed as follows:
      22.2.2.1. Against an ANG member when the loss, damage, or destruction is caused by
      the member's negligence or willful misconduct in performing ANG military duties or as a
      result of deliberate unauthorized use of the property.
      22.2.2.2. Against the state when the loss, damage, or destruction is incident to duty or
      activity under the laws of, and in direct support of, the authorities of the state, regardless
      of who was actually using the property at the time.
      22.2.2.3. Against the full-time employee (civilian, AGR, or military technician) incident
      to employment as an ANG employee when the loss, damage, or destruction was caused
      by negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use of the property.
22.3. ANG ROS Guidance.
   22.3.1. The following are ANG exceptions to requirements in other parts of this manual:
      22.3.1.1. The monthly basic pay in the ANG is defined as:

          tenant activity, the ANG approving authority will not process any ROS for non-ANG
          tenant activities on, or attached for logistic support to, an ANG installation. If the
          non-ANG tenant is a detachment of the Air National Guard Readiness Center
          (ANGRC) Andrews AFB, Maryland, the approving authority is the ANGRC
          commander or designee; however, the host chief of Supply requires a suspense copy
          of a non-ANG tenant's ROS on property accounted for on Equipment Authorization
          Inventory Data (EAID) records, individual clothing and equipment records, and other
          similar types of accountable records or custody receipts for the ANG chief of Supply.

occurred. It is further defined as the primary moving cause, or the predominant cause, from
which the injury follows as a natural, direct, and immediate consequence, and without which it
would not have occurred.
Report of Survey—An official report of the facts and circumstances supporting the assessment
of financial liability for the loss, damage, or destruction of Air Force controlled property. It
serves as the basis for the government's claim for restitution for the loss or damage against a
person, state, territory, or activity.
Responsibility—1. The obligation to carry forward an assigned task to a successful conclusion.
With responsibility goes authority to direct and take the necessary action to ensure success. 2.

after examination of the facts and circumstances of this case. Before the ROS is sent to the
appointing and approving authorities, you are entitled to exercise the certain options. You may:

       a. Voluntarily pay the amount of the loss in block 8, DD Form 200 unless the
recommendation is a reduced liability. If the recommendation is a reduced liability, the
approving authority must review and sign the form before you may voluntarily pay the
recommended amount. Payment may be made in cash using DD Form 1131, Cash Collection
Voucher, or by payroll deduction using DD Form 362, Statement of Charges/Cash Collection

negligence or abuse and which you believe is relevant to a determination of who should be held
liable.

        d. Request that the approving authority allow you to satisfy this liability by replacing or
repairing the property. Replacement property or repair to Air Force property must meet
minimum Air Force standards. If there is any doubt as to whether the replacement property or
repair meet Air Force Standards, the property or repair will not be accepted.

  SAMPLE NOTIFICATION OF INTENT BY THE INVESTIGATING OFFICIAL TO
     ASSESS FINANCIAL LIABILITY (GOVERNMENT HOUSING DAMAGE)

                                   (Appropriate Letterhead)

    The following is a sample memorandum notifying an individual that a ROS investigating
official has recommended that he or she be held liable for damage to family or unaccompanied
personnel housing (including loss, damage, or destruction of furnishings and equipment therein).
Also see paragraph 1.5 of this manual.

    Attached is a DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss, which
recommends that you be assessed $----- for (loss, damage, or destruction) of government housing
(housing, furnishings, equipment, or list the specific description of lost, damaged, or destroyed
property). This ROS is being processed according to guidance and procedures in AFMAN 23-
220.

    The recommendation to hold you financially liable was rendered by the investigating official
after examination of the facts and circumstances of this case. Before the ROS is sent to the
appointing and approving authorities, you are entitled to certain options. You may:

      a. Examine the findings and recommendations on the DD Form 200 and you may
examine the evidence supporting them.

      b. Present any additional evidence and submit a statement which refutes the findings and
which you believe is relevant to a determination of who should be held liable. Your
acknowledgment of this ROS is neither an admission of liability nor an acknowledgment of a
debt.

       c. Seek legal or other counsel in preparation of a written statement; however, it must be
submitted over your signature, or it must contain your signed endorsement that the statement
prepared by counsel is submitted with your full concurrence and consent.

       d. Request waiver of any financial liability which may arise as a result of this ROS under
the provisions of 10 U.S.C. Section 2775. Specific instructions are outlined below.

        e. Request that the approving authority allow you to satisfy this liability by replacing or
repairing the property. This repair or replacement must meet minimum Air Force standards. If
there is any doubt about meeting these standards, the property or repair will not be accepted.

      f. Voluntarily pay the amount of the loss in Block 8, DD Form 200, unless the
recommendation is reduced liability. If the recommendation is reduced liability, the approving

authority must review and sign the form before you may voluntarily pay the recommended
amount. Payment may be made in cash using DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, or by
payroll deduction using DD Form 362, Statement of Charges/Cash Collection Voucher.

   Specific instructions:

      a. Place an "X" in the proper area of block 16a on the attached DD Form 200, and
complete blocks 16b through 16h.

       b. If you checked block 16a(l), attach your statement to the DD Form 200.

        c. If you elect to submit a written request for waiver of any financial liability which may
arise from this ROS, you must submit a fully-substantiated waiver request when you return the
signed DD Form 200 as instructed in paragraph f below.

               (1) Your waiver request only will be used if the approving authority assesses
    financial liability. However, it must be submitted now so it will be immediately available to
    the approving authority if and when liability is assessed.

              (2) A waiver request is not an appeal. It is a request for the approving authority
    to consider, in the best interest of the government, financial liability assessed against you for
    housing damage. Factors that may be considered for waiving the financial liability are in
    AFMAN 23-220, Chapter 8.

       d. If you elect not to submit a written request for waiver of any financial liability which
may arise from this ROS, the approving authority automatically considers a waiver based solely
on the merits of the ROS file. In other words, waiver consideration is automatic, regardless of
whether or not you specifically request it.

       e. Any written waiver request submitted based on paragraph c above, must be separate
from any statement submitted per paragraph b pertaining to additional evidence. They are
submitted at the same time, but they must be separate statements.

        f. Return the DD Form 200 (Atch 1) and any rebuttal statement and/or waiver request to
the ROS program manager (indicate name, organization, and office symbol) as soon as possible,
but not later than 30 days from the date you were notified of this ROS by this memorandum.

       g. Retain the copy of the ROS file (Atch 2) for your records.

    When the ROS program manager receives your signed DD Form 200, the entire ROS file,
including your statement and/or waiver request, if submitted, will be sent to the appointing and
approving authorities for determination of financial liability.

         a. If you are relieved from liability, you will be notified.

       b. If you are held liable, the approving authority immediately considers whether or not to
waive that liability in the best interest of the government. If any liability remains after waiver
consideration, you will be notified of your options regarding payment, appeal, or further waiver
consideration by the next higher commander.

    If you do not respond to this memorandum within 30 days, we will process a copy of the
ROS as stated above. If you returned DD Form 200 with block 16a(l) checked but failed to
submit a statement, we will process the ROS without it, if a statement is not received within 30
days of the date you were notified of this ROS by this memorandum. If you have any questions,
please contact (name, organizations, office symbol, telephone number of the ROS program
manager).

     APPROVING AUTHORITY (NON-GOVERNMENT HOUSING DAMAGE)


                                   (Appropriate Letterhead)

    The following is a sample notifying an individual that the approving authority s assessed
financial liability against that individual for loss or damage to government property (other than

    The approving authority arrived at the assessment of financial liability based on the (value of
the lost property/repair cost of the damaged property) or one months basic pay, whichever was
less. Consideration was also given to the existence of factors listed in AFMAN 23-220, Chapter
8 in arriving at the amount of financial liability assessed.

    A copy of this ROS will be sent to the Financial Services Officer (FSO) for collection of the
amount specified on DD Form 200. You have 30 days to decide what action you would like to

Voucher.

        b. Pay the amount due by authorizing a payroll deduction, using DD Form 362,
Statement of Charges for Government Property Lost, Damaged, or Destroyed, under the
policies and procedures established in accounting and finance directives.

  SAMPLE NOTIFICATION OF ASSESSMENT OF FINANCIAL LIABILITY BY THE
       APPROVING AUTHORITY (GOVERNMENT HOUSING DAMAGE)

                                   (Appropriate Letterhead)

    The following is a sample memorandum to notify Air Force personnel that the approving
authority has assessed financial liability against that member for damage, loss, or destruction of
government property or housing. Also see paragraph 1.5.

    After considering the facts and circumstances documented in ROS (indicate number) the
approving authority has assessed financial liability against you in the amount of $_______ for
(loss, damage, or destruction) of government (housing, furnishings, or equipment, or provide a
specific description of lost, damaged, or destroyed property). A copy of the completed DD Form
200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss, is provided for your records (Atch 1).
This ROS was conducted under the provisions of AFMAN 23-220.

    The approving authority considered the following factors in arriving at the amount of
financial liability: (appointing or approving authority or program manager checks appropriate
blocks).

        a. Gross negligence or willful misconduct was evident. Financial liability was assessed
for the full amount of the loss.

       b. Simple negligence or deliberate unauthorized use was evident. Financial liability was
assessed for the full amount of the loss or one month's basic pay, whichever is less.

        c. After determination of financial liability, the approving authority considered waiving
the liability in the best interest of the government. The waiver was considered regardless of
whether or not you specifically requested it. After determining the amount of financial liability
as $_________, it was partially waived, resulting in a debt of $________.

        d. After determination of financial liability, the approving authority considered waiving
the liability in the best interest of the government. The waiver was considered regardless of
whether or not you specifically requested it; however, no part of the financial liability was
waived.

    A copy of this ROS will be sent to the Financial Services Officer (FSO) for collection of the
amount specified on DD Form 200. You have 30 days to decide what action you would like to
take in response to this notification. Numerous options are available to you. You may:

     a. Pay the amount due in cash to the FSO, using DD Form 1131, Cash Collection
Voucher.

       b. Pay the amount due by authorizing a payroll deduction, using DD Form 362,
Statement of Charges/Cash Collection Voucher, under the policies and procedures established
in accounting and finance directives.

        c. Request a written agreement to repay the debt in installments. A request for
installment payments must be accompanied by your financial statement submitted under penalty
of perjury.

        d. Appeal the assessment of financial liability. The appeal must be in writing and
submitted to the approving authority within 30 days of this notification memorandum or it cannot
be considered unless the amount of the assessed liability exceeds one month's base pay. In this
case, written intent to submit an appeal must be provided to the approving authority within 30
days of the date of this memorandum. The appeal must be submitted within 60 days of the date
of this memorandum.

        e. Seek legal or other counsel in preparing a written appeal; however, it must be
submitted over your signature, or it must contain your signed endorsement that the appeal is
submitted with your full concurrence and consent. If your appeal is denied by the approving
authority, it will automatically be sent to the next higher commander for final action by authority
of the Secretary of the Air Force.

        f. Request further waiver consideration by the commander. If you elect this option, the
only action required is to notify the ROS program manager, appointing authority or the
approving authority, in writing, of your request. No additional justification may be considered at
this time. The next higher commander takes final action on waivers by the authority of the
Secretary of the Air Force.

       g. Retain legal counsel.

       h. Inspect and copy records relating to the debt.

       i. Review the decision relating to the debt.

        j. Request a remission of indebtedness if you are an enlisted member. Officers have the
right to request a Secretary of Air Force (SAF) waiver. These requests are processed by the
FSO.

         k. Include comments regarding what adverse financial impact the assessment of financial
liability will have on you. Providing supporting documentation is optional.

   If you elect both options in sub-paragraphs c and d, both must be done concurrently. You
may not later change your election except to withdraw an option.

    If you do not exercise any of the options within 30 days of this notification, the Air Force
will initiate involuntarily collection action under policies and procedures in accounting and
finance directives. The statutory authority for involuntary collection is     37 U.S.C. Section
1007c for members and 5 U.S.C. Section 5514 for civilian employees. Any portion of this debt
uncollected at the time of your employment termination will be collected from your final pay and
allowances.

   If you elect to appeal and/or request further waiver consideration, the debt will be recorded
on your military pay record, but collection will be suspended until the appeal and/or waiver
request is ruled upon. You will be further notified when the results of the appeal are available.

    The foregoing notification is given to allow you every opportunity to respond to the actions
taken on the attached ROS. We encourage you to respond promptly. If you need administrative
assistance, contact (name, organization, office symbol, and phone number of ROS program
manager).
