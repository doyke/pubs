                                             Chapter 1

                           PRINCIPLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Facility Project Planning and Programming Objective. The objective of facility project
planning and programming is to provide quality facilities needed to perform the Air Force
mission. All commanders and civilian directors shall support this objective by ensuring project
requests meet validated requirements; are in compliance with all applicable standards; are
programmed at the lowest life cycle cost; achieve optimum resource efficiency and minimize
damage to the natural and human environments; and are within authorities and available
resources.
1.2. Principles. Planning and programming facilities follows these principles;
     1.2.1. Facility Project Planning. Facility project planning identifies facilities needed to
     satisfy current and future mission requirements, determines the most economical means of
     providing those facilities, and identifies the year in which they will be required. This
     determination shall always begin with an evaluation of existing facilities for their suitability
     to satisfy mission requirements.
        1.2.1.1. Asset Management /Activity Management Plans. Executive Order 13327,
        through AFPD 32-90 and the AFI 32-9000 series, directs efficient and economical use of
        federal real property assets by all federal departments and agencies through the
        development and implementation of an asset management planning process. Air Force
        Civil Engineering Asset Management employs Activity Management Plans (AMPs) for
        key installation services (to include providing facilities) to integrate CE processes in a
        standardized manner. This approach ensures visibility of all requirements to support key
        assets needed for mission execution and provide the capability to advocate for and
        allocate the necessary resources over the life of those assets. By implementing
        comprehensive AMPs at installation, MAJCOM/DRU, and HQ USAF Staff levels, risk
        management based decisions can be made ensuring valuable resources are expended
        where they are needed most. CE asset management implementation leverages a spiral
        development process and will incorporate MILCON planning in the future.
     1.2.2. Military Construction (MILCON) Programming. MILCON programming is the
     process of acquiring both the authority and resources necessary to meet facility requirements
     identified by the planning process. A construction project with an estimated cost greater than
     $750,000 is normally funded through the MILCON Program.
1.3. Responsibilities:
     1.3.1. Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Installations), SAF/IEI. Provides
     Air Force policy development and oversight, and advocates for the MILCON program

  OSD, OMB, and Congress. Coordinates construction programs requiring interagency
  approvals, such as defense access roads, medical facilities, defense fuels, and energy
  conservation.
  1.3.4. US Air Force Reserve, AF/RE. Issues guidance to Air Force Reserve Command
  (AFRC) for submitting its MILCON program, reviews and validates the submittal, assists Air
  Staff in determining size and content of their MILCON program, and advocates for the
  AFRC MILCON program through OSD and Congress. AFRC MILCON programming,
  design, and execution will continue to be accomplished by AFRC, in coordination with
  AFCEE, USACE, or NAVFAC.
  1.3.5. Air National Guard, NGB/A7. Provides instructions to ANG installation
  commanders for planning and preparing construction programs, reviews and validates cost
  estimates and program documents, validates and prioritizes facility requirements. Prepares
  and submits the ANG MILCON portion of the Presidents Budget. Advocates for the ANG
  MILCON program through National Guard Bureau, OSD, and Congress. ANG MILCON
  programming, design, and execution will continue to be accomplished by ANG, in
  coordination with AFCEE, USACE, or NAVFAC.
  1.3.6. Major Commands, Field Operating Agencies and Direct Reporting
  Units. Develop and submit MILCON programs in accordance with guidance issued by
  AF/A7CP and all applicable Air Force Instructions. Provide instructions and guidance to
  installation commanders for planning and submitting MILCON programs; to include review
  and validation of scope, cost estimates, and validation and prioritization of all facility
  requirements. Coordinate with all applicable functions; including MAJCOM/A6 to verify all
  communication requirements are documented and cost estimates are accurate. Execute O&M
  funded Requirements Documents (RD2s) in support of the MILCON program.
  MAJCOM/DRUs should ensure AFCEE representation at RD2 development efforts. Consult
  with AFCEE on MILCON acquisition strategies and other policy, or project features
  affecting programming such as LEED, and standard design aspects.
  1.3.6. (AFSC) Air Force Sustainment Center. Provides management, oversight, and
  advocacy for the Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC) MILCON program. Provide
  instructions and guidance to installation commanders for planning and submitting MILCON
  programs; to include the review and validation of scope, cost estimates, and validation and
  prioritization of all facility requirements.
     1.3.6.1. (Added-AFSC) The responsibility to advocate for AFSC resources has been
     assigned to the AFSC/CC. In order to properly manage MILCON resources and
     requirements, AFSC/LGMI has been assigned as AFSC MILCON manager to coordinate
     MILCON actions with AFMC/A7.
     1.3.6.2. (Added-AFSC) AFSC MILCON manager will, no later than 30 days after the
     HAF facility panel meets, hold a meeting/telecom with each BCE to outline lessons
     learned from the previous year MILCON data call and to discuss the strategic direction
     for the current year process.

    1.3.7. Installation Commanders. Identify, plan, and program facilities to support their
    assigned missions. Determine whether existing facilities are available to meet the mission
    requirement (refer to AFI 32-9001, Acquisition of Real Property); ensure existing facilities
    are used economically and efficiently and that excess space is evaluated for demolition. (See
    also Para. 3.3.2). Once a facility requirement has been accepted, work with the requestor to
    initiate an AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis. The communication
    squadron identifies all communication necessary to provide a complete and useable facility,
    and must coordinate work with their base STEM-B to identify communication requirements.
    This ensures information provided aligns with the base communication blue print. Prioritize
    and submit MILCON programs to their assigned MAJCOM.
       1.3.7.1. Installation Base Civil Engineer (BCE). Ensure all required certifications and
       environmental actions are complete or well underway prior to project submission to
       MAJCOM for programming consideration. Installation shall accomplish required
       planning actions, compliance items, and certificates for every MILCON project and
       retain for future reference and project management. Installation BCE will also develop
       an initial requirements document (RD1) and project management plan (PMP) to support
       their MILCON projects.
    1.3.8. Host, Tenant, and Supported Unit Responsibilities. The host installation will
    provide services to tenant and supported units in accordance with AFI 25-201, Support
    Agreement Requirements and AFI 65-601, Vol 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures.
       1.3.8.1. Projects for On-Base Tenants and Supported Units. Host installations will
       provide facilities and/or space needed by on-base tenants or supported units from existing
       assets, if available. If adequate existing facilities are not available, or if the tenant
       otherwise requires construction or renovation of facilities for its sole use, the host
       installation will prepare program-related project documentation on behalf of the tenant or
       supported unit's mission. The host installation will then forward documentation
       concurrently to the host MAJCOM/DRU and tenant or supported MAJCOM Civil
       Engineers. Any MILCON requirements programmed or planned by other organizations
       must be coordinated by the host base MAJCOM/CV. This level of authority will not be
       delegated below the host MAJCOM/CV. Additionally, for mission bed-down MILCON,
       the host base MAJCOM/DRU must participate in the bed-down planning and the host
       MAJCOM/CV will coordinate on the bed-down plan. The tenant or supported units
       command will validate the project, establish its priority, and submit the project as part of
       its MILCON submittal to AF/A7CP. ANG should reference AFI 32-1012, Reserve
       Component Facilities Programs.
       1.3.8.1. (AFSC) Host installations shall ensure the Air Logistics Complex (ALC)
       Commander or designated representative has a membership/voting role during Air Base
       Wing (ABW) space utilization panels, facility panels and facility boards. Additionally,
       all AFSC tenant or supported units will have, at minimum, an advisory/non-voting role
       during ABW space utilization panels, facility panels and facility boards.
       1.3.8.2. Air Force Reserve Command Units. Host Installations will follow AFI 25-
       201, Support Agreements Requirements, on host-tenant relationships when reserve
       component units are tenants on Air Force installations.

                   MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT PLANNING

2.1. Planning. Effective planning establishes facility and infrastructure requirements critical for
mission accomplishment and proposes the most effective and economical means of satisfying
those requirements.
2.2. Planning Actions.
     2.2.1. Determine Requirements. Installations identify future facility needs 3 – 5 years in
     the future and determine which needs cannot be met with existing facilities. Installation
     commanders review, validate, and prioritize installation MILCON facility requirements.
     MAJCOM/DRUs review and submit their programs as outlined in paragraph 3.3.7.
     Requirements shall be based on AFH 32-1084, Facility Requirements, which provides typical
     requirements for a given facility type. Reference to other Air Force or DoD publications or a
     detailed study of unique user requirements may also be necessary to determine complete
     needs. The ANG has unique facility requirements that can be different from active duty
     installations. ANG unique facility requirements are published by NGB/A7.
     2.2.2. Evaluate Alternative Solutions. Installations evaluate existing assets and determine
     the most economical and effective means of satisfying facility needs. New construction may
     require justification based on an economic analysis performed in accordance with AFI 65-
     501, Economic Analysis.
2.3. Certificate of Compliance. Installations shall accomplish several planning actions for
every MILCON project. These planning results should be approved by the Installation Facilities
Board before obtaining the Certificate of Compliance (as shown in Figure 2.1.), signed by the
installation commander, documenting completion of these actions. MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs
review these certificates to ensure installations have fulfilled all compliance requirements, and

                     MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMING

3.1. MILCON Programming. Programming is the process of developing and obtaining
approval and funding for Military Construction (MILCON) projects. Installations identify,
develop, and validate MILCON projects, and submit prioritized list of projects to their
MAJCOM/DRU. MAJCOM/DRUs compile, validate, and submit prioritized command
MILCON programs according to this AFI and instructions provided in HQ USAF MILCON
program annual call letters. AF/A7CP presents the Total Force AF MILCON program to the Air
Force Corporate Structure and advocates for MILCON resources through the Air Force
Corporate Structure, OSD, OMB, and Congress. NGB/A7A and AF/RE establish submittal dates
and issue annual guidance to ANG and AFRC installations for the separate submittal of their
MILCON programs to OSD. The MILCON program is typically a five-year process.
Requirements, identification, feasibility studies, DD Forms 1391 creation, etc., should be
programmed for and accomplished prior to formally initiating a project into the Air Force
program.
3.1. (AFSC)MILCON Programming. Installations will identify, develop, validate, and submit
a prioritized list of MILCON projects to the AFSC/LGMI MILCON manager unless otherwise
directed by annual call letter. AFSC staff will consolidate and submit an AFSC prioritized list to
MAJCOM/DRU. AFSC MILCON manager will advocate for submitted projects to the
MAJCOM facility panel.
3.2. Definition of MILCON. Military Construction, as defined in Title 10, United States Code,
Section 2801, Military Construction and Military Family Housing includes any construction,
development, conversion, or extension of any kind carried out with respect to a military
installation. MILCON includes construction projects for all types of buildings, roads, airfield
pavements, and utility systems costing $750,000 or more. The Air Force MILCON program
objective is to provide quality facilities to support Air Force missions. A MILCON project
includes all construction work necessary to produce a complete and usable facility or complete
and usable improvement to an existing facility. Additionally, instances may occur when
maintenance and repair work will be accomplished as MILCON, either because it is part of a
large project or a decision has been made to use MILCON instead of O&M funds. MILCON
may in some cases be required to fund the cost of environmental contamination. For details and
requirements, refer to AFI 32-7020, The Environmental Restoration Program, para. 3.6.
   3.2.1. Project Authority. Authority to carry out a MILCON project includes authority for
   surveys and site preparation; acquisition, conversion, rehabilitation, or installation of
   facilities; acquisition and installation of equipment and appurtenances integral to the project;
   acquisition and installation of supporting facilities (including utilities) and appurtenances
   incident to the project; and planning, supervision, administration, and overhead incident to
   the project.
   3.2.2. Project Limitations. Each MILCON project shall result in a complete and usable
   facility or a complete and usable improvement to a facility. Avoid combining work on
   multiple facilities of different types into a single project. Combining multiple projects into a
   single, lump sum request is prohibited, except when each project is in the same general
AFI32-1021_AFSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2013                                                                27


   facility category (i.e. supply facilities, maintenance and production facilities, etc.) and the
   required completion date of each facility necessitates programming all of them in the same
   fiscal year. OMB Circular A-11, Part 2, Sections 31.3 and 31.6 prohibit incrementally funded
   MILCON projects. Phasing of large projects is permitted, however; each phase must be
   independently complete and usable if the subsequent out year’s phases are delayed due to
   funding constraint.
3.3. MILCON Project Development. Project development is one of the most important
actions in MILCON programming and is documented using a DD Form 1391. The DD Form
1391, by itself, shall explain and justify the project to all levels of the Air Force, OSD, OMB,
and Congress. Justification data shall clearly describe the impact on mission, people,
productivity, life-cycle cost, etc., if the project is not accomplished. Installation BCEs will also
develop an initial requirement document (RD1) and project management plan (PMP) to support
their MILCON projects.
   3.3.1. Automated Civil Engineer System - Project Management Module (ACES-
   PM). ACES-PM is the single official Air Force-wide database management system used to
   create, store, retrieve, and update MILCON project records. It is used to develop the Air
   Force MILCON program from MAJCOM/DRU submittals, support the MILCON submittal
   to Congress, answer Congressional inquiries, provide an audit trail and historical record of
   project activity, and as an information source for Air Force managers. Program managers
   will use the data in ACES-PM to update and monitor project progress, cost, and schedule.
   This unique and essential relational database requires all ACES-PM users ensure project data
   for which they are responsible is accurate and current. ACES-PM does not currently apply to
   the ANG.
   3.3.2. Project Identification. With the exception of HQ USAF-directed projects,
   installation commanders determine which facility needs cannot be met with existing
   facilities. Installation commanders review, validate, and prioritize installation MILCON
   facility requirements. When it is determined a facility shall be constructed or upgraded, the
   Base Civil Engineer (BCE) will prepare and submit DD Form 1391, with all other applicable
   documentation, and enter the project into the Automated Civil Engineering System Project
   Management module (ACES-PM). Documentation (typically obtained from facility users)
   shall include a fully justified, indisputable case for accomplishing the project. A project is
   considered “initiated” for programming once it is entered into the ACES-PM system. For
   ANG projects, the BCE submits DD Forms 1391s/1390s to NGB/A7A. AFRC submits forms
   to AF/RE.
   3.3.3. Validation. HQ USAF, MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs, and installations shall validate each
   MILCON project by verifying the requirement that creates the need for the proposed project
   and confirming the proposed project is the most cost effective means of satisfying the
   requirement. Projects justified on an economic basis, and all projects costing over $2 million,
   require an economic analysis in accordance with AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis. The
   MAJCOM/A7CP or equivalent confirms by a signed letter that DD Form 1391 data is
   accurate and complete.
   3.3.4. Project Cost Estimates. Accurate project cost estimates are essential to successful
   MILCON project development and execution. Cost estimates must be closely scrutinized to
   ensure they are in-line with the OSD Pricing Guide or fully justified with historical cost data.
 28                                                   AFI32-1021_AFSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2013


   Installations and MAJCOM/DRUs should prepare cost estimates using parametric estimating
   tools. The basis for parametric project cost estimates shall be a completed Requirements
   Document, as defined by the USAF Project Managers Guide for Design and Construction.
   Use the Tri-Service Parametric Cost Engineering System (PACES) as a tool to develop
   parametric cost estimates; however, PACES cost estimates for primary facilities shall be
   consistent with unit prices published in OSD Pricing guide or AFCESA Historical
   Construction Cost Handbook. Major cost differences between PACES and the OSD Pricing
   Guide (e.g., clay tile roof versus standing seam metal roof) shall be fully justified to
   AF/A7CP. Capture unique requirements of a project as separate line items under Primary or
   Supporting Facility cost. The cost of Sustainable Design should be identified under Primary
   Facilities. Project costs shall include contingency (typically 5 percent) and Supervision,
   Inspection, and Overhead (SIOH). SIOH costs vary by locations; within the USA - 5.7%
   except Hawaii and Alaska - 6.5%, and Guam 6.2%. Outside the USA it is 6.5% except 2.5%
   in United Kingdom and 7.7% in Afghanistan and Iraq. Coordinate with AFCEE to confirm
   the project design method, Design Build vs. Traditional. For Design Build projects, a 4%
   design cost should be included on the DD Form 1391.
   3.3.5. Design Schedules. MAJCOM/DRUs shall document design and construction
   schedules in Block 12 of the DD Form 1391 for each MILCON project. The schedule shall
   show design will be complete in time to award the construction in the fiscal year that funding
   is requested. Projects not achieving this status at the time of the Budget Estimate Submission
   (BES) by AF/A7CP risk being deleted from the program by OSD Comptroller. Coordinate
   with AFCEE to validate project design schedule.
   3.3.6. Demolition. Demolition funded as part of a MILCON project shall be directly related
   to the project (e.g., in the footprint of the new construction or no longer needed as a result of
   the new construction). Once the project is appropriated and authorized by Congress, the
   scope of demolition work (total square meters/footage) identified shall be accomplished to
   complete the project. Facilities committed to Congress for demolition shall be promptly
   removed from the inventory.
   3.3.7. MAJCOM/DRU MILCON Program Submittals. MAJCOM/DRUs shall prioritize
   validated projects and submit their commander-approved program in accordance with annual
   MILCON program call letter issued by AF/A7CP. AFRC and ANG shall submit projects to
   their respective Joint Service Reserve Component Facility Board in accordance with
   instructions found in AFI 32-1012, Reserve Component Facilities Programs. NGB/A7A and
   AF/RE shall submit their prioritized validated program to HQ AF/A7CP for total force
   consolidation and Air Force corporate structure review.
3.4. MILCON Program Development. AF/A7CP, in conjunction with other HQ USAF
functional offices, will review each MILCON project in detail and validate the need, engineering
feasibility, economic benefits, compliance with Air Force objectives, and project scope and cost.
In developing the MILCON program, AF/A7CP consolidates projects from the
MAJCOM/DRUs, ANG, AFR, Fact-of-Life requirements, and Corporate Adjustments, and
presents the proposed program to the Air Force corporate structure for approval.
   3.4.1. Fact-of-Life Projects. Fact-of-Life projects are required to achieve compliance with
   laws, treaties, and international agreements. Projects are intended solely for initial
   construction, modification, or upgrade of a facility, system, or component(s) to comply with
AFI32-1021_AFSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2013                                                             29


   new Federal and/or State environmental laws or regulations. Other infrastructure projects
   must compete for MILCON or O&M funding as applicable on their own merits.
   MAJCOM/DRUs should include environmental projects in a fiscal year MILCON program
   early enough to prevent non-compliance. Project narrative and data shall identify project
   requirements and justify them as Level I, Fact-of-Life requirements, and include information
   on violations (refer to AFI 32-7001, Environmental Budgeting).
   3.4.2. Corporate Adjustments. Corporate Adjustments are projects approved and placed in
   the MILCON program by Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) or the Secretary of the Air
   Force (SECAF) due to their overriding importance to the Air Force. These projects are so
   necessary that they are considered “must-pay” bills and do not compete with other
   MAJCOM/DRU requirements.
3.5. MILCON and Program Objective Memorandum Schedules. The Air Force submits a
biennial MILCON budget (two fiscal years at one time) to OSD each even numbered fiscal year.
OSD reviews both years in detail and issues decisions on each. Congress, however, does not
normally review the second year program, and therefore, that program is resubmitted by the Air
Force to OSD the next year as an amended program. OSD reviews the amended program, and
after approval, it is submitted to Congress as part of the President's Budget (PB) for that
respective year. Additionally, each even numbered year, a six-year MILCON program or Future
Years Defense Program (FYDP) is developed for the Program Objective Memorandum (POM),
which outlines the forces and resources proposed for the next six years. Scheduling of these
submittals is subject to change and is provided annually by the OSD Comptroller.
   3.5.1. Office of the Secretary of Defense Budget Review. The Air Force submits the
   MILCON budget to OSD by facility category (such as operations and training facilities,
   maintenance and production facilities, research and development facilities, etc.). OSD
   reviews every project submitted and issues Resource Management Decisions (RMDs) that
   transmit their proposed decision on every project (approve, disapprove, revise, or defer to a
   future year). OSD provides reasons for their decisions. If the Air Force is not satisfied with
   these decisions and a strong case can be made to rebut the proposed decision, a reclama is
   developed and submitted. OSD review and consideration of these reclamas, along with senior
   level negotiations, determine the final RMD decision and ultimately the content and size of
   the MILCON program to be included in the President's Budget. After approval by OMB and
   the President, the budget is submitted to Congress in the first week of February.
   3.5.2. Congressional Review. The Secretary of Defense submits the MILCON portion (for
   all services and Defense-Wide Agencies) of the President's Budget to Congress in listings
   aggregated by country and state. The Secretary of Defense requests both authorization and
   appropriation for each MILCON project from Congress.
       3.5.2.1. Congressional Authorization. Authorization of MILCON projects is provided
       by the Defense Authorization Bill that includes authorization requests for other Defense
       accounts such as Procurement; Research, Development, Test and Evaluation; Operations
       and Maintenance; and Military Personnel. Normally, all projects that comprise the
       MILCON total obligation authority (TOA) are included in the authorization request.
       However, items authorized in a prior year for which only an appropriation is being
       requested are not included in the authorization request. They are included in the
       appropriation request only.
 30                                                 AFI32-1021_AFSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2013


          3.5.2.1.1. Armed Services Committees. The House and Senate Armed Services
          Committees review the MILCON authorization request and hold hearings attended by
          witnesses from each service. These two committees then issue reports detailing their
          recommendations. The full House and Senate then act on the committees
          recommendations and each passes its own version of the authorization program
          (referred to as committee marks).
          3.5.2.1.2. Congressional Authorization Conference Actions. Differences between
          the House and Senate versions are resolved by an Armed Services Conference
          Committee which also issues a report that shows how the differences were resolved.
          Congress then passes the authorization program approved by the conference that
          becomes the authorization act. After the President signs the act, it becomes law
          (National Defense Authorization Act).
          3.5.2.1.3. Authorization Expirations. If no obligation is made for a project within
          three years after an authorization act becomes law, the authorization for that project
          will expire, unless an authorization extension is included in the authorization act
          passed at the end of the third year. AFCEE staffs shall submit requests for extensions
          to AF/A7CP describing the circumstances that prevented obligation. AF/A7CP will
          validate the request and ask OSD, through SAF/IEI, to include requests for the
          extension in the authorization bill submitted to Congress.
          3.5.2.1.4. Other Matters Included in Authorization Request. The authorization
          request may include proposed changes to the existing United States Code that the
          Secretary of Defense submits for legislative consideration. MAJCOM/FOA/DRUs
          can propose legislative changes to AF/A7CP for consideration. The proposed changes
          will be reviewed by AF/A7C and staffed through SAF/IEI to OSD for consideration.
       3.5.2.2. Congressional Appropriation. The Secretary of Defense requests, for all
       services, appropriations for all items in the MILCON total obligation authority. The
       MILCON appropriation is a separate bill from all other DOD appropriations. The House
       and Senate Appropriations Committees follow the same procedure outlined for the
       Armed Services Committees in Paragraph 3.5.2.1., in reviewing the appropriation
       request. After the President signs the bill, it becomes law (Military Construction and
       Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act). MILCON appropriations expire five years after
       they are appropriated. However, from time to time, general reductions and rescissions
       reduce funds available in prior years.
   3.5.3. Construction of Projects. AF/A7CPP will issue an initial design instruction in
   ACES to AFCEE to signal the authority to start the design of a project. Once this action takes
   place, control of project design and construction will be transferred to AFCEE. After both the
   authorization and appropriation acts are signed, AF/A7CP will arrange funding for
   construction of projects on a project-by-project basis. Refer to AFI 32-1023, Designing and
   Constructing Military Construction Projects (Chapters 2 and 3).
3.6. Project Files. Installations, MAJCOM/DRUs, AFCEE, and AF/A7CP should maintain
MILCON project files according to the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located
at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm .
3.7. Special Military Construction Authorities.
AFI32-1021_AFSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2013                                                          31


  3.7.1. Defense Medical MILCON.
     3.7.1.1. Authority. This program is managed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of
     Defense for Health Affairs, OASD(HA), and is funded by the Defense Health Program,
     not the Air Force TOA. This section applies to all active Air Force medical and medical
     related facilities; it does not apply to ANG medical facilities. The following directives
     apply: DoDI 6015.17, Planning and Acquisition of Military Health Facilities; and MIL-
     HDBK-1191, Department of Defense Medical and Dental Treatment Facilities Design
     and Construction Criteria.
     3.7.1.2. Project Justification, Submittal, and Program Development. OASD (HA)
     issues an annual call to the services for medical MILCON projects. Installations, with
     assistance from the Regional Health Facility Office (RHFO), develop MILCON
     requirements. The RHFO, with assistance from the Medical Treatment Facility
     Commander (MTF) and the BCE, develop DD Form 1391. The BCE prepares supporting
     documents in accordance with Chapter 2 of this Instruction. Installations forward
     completed DD Forms 1391 to the MAJCOM Civil Engineer and Surgeon General. They,
     in turn, jointly validate and prioritize all projects, and submit them to the Air Force
     Medical Support Agency (AF/SGSFW) with information copies to the Air Force Center
     for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE/CM) and AF/A7CP. AF/SG prioritizes the
     MAJCOM projects, develops the DoD Medical MILCON Program, and forwards the
     projects to OASD (HA) as part of the unified medical POM submission.
     3.7.1.3. Medical Unspecified Minor Construction Requirements. Installations and
     MAJCOMs shall process Medical Unspecified Minor Construction (UMC) requirements
     in the same manner as medical MILCON projects. OASD (HA) funds approved projects
     from the Defense Health Program. Projects programmed under the unspecified minor
     construction authority shall comply with DoDI 6015.17. UMC programming further is
     described in Chapter 4 of this Instruction.
     3.7.1.4. Medical Relocatable Facilities. Medical relocatable facilities are provided in
     accordance with guidance in Chapter 6 of this Instruction.
  3.7.2. Defense Access Road (DAR) Program.
     3.7.2.1. General. This program provides a means for DoD to contribute funding to
     improve public highways serving defense installations and activities. The program is
     authorized by Title 23, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 660, Subpart E, Defense Access
     Roads, and implemented by Army Regulation 55-80, DoD Transportation Engineering
     Program. The DAR Program is managed by Military Surface Deployment and
     Distribution Command (SDDC), Department of the Army, and co-administered by the
     Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Department of Transportation. The FHWA is
     the link to State and local transportation agencies that normally execute the projects.
     3.7.2.2. DAR Project Justification and Submittal. The DoD expects state and local
     transportation agencies to develop and maintain public highways that serve permanent
     defense installations. Before requesting funds through the DAR program, an installation
     shall first request the jurisdictional authority to fund and accomplish the required
     improvements. However, some defense-generated impact may be too sudden or unusual
     to be incorporated into normal civil highway improvement programs. Such impacts could
32                                                 AFI32-1021_AFSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2013


     include traffic increases due to major on-base facility expansions, addition of a new
     entrance gate, a requirement to move unique defense vehicles on low-volume roads, or
     realignment of public roads due to new facility development (e.g., runway extension).
     When it is understood that State and local authorities cannot or will not fund the
     necessary improvements, installations shall submit an Access Road Needs Report
     through their MAJCOM/DRU to AF/A7CP for requirement validation.
     3.7.2.3. DAR Project Programming and Execution. Upon validation, AF/A7CP will
     coordinate the requirement with SDDC for eligibility determination and certification that
     the road is important to national defense. With AF/A7CP validation and SDDC
     certification, the MAJCOM/DRU shall include the project in the next command
     MILCON submittal, and clearly identify the requirement on the DD Form 1391 as a DAR
     project. Air Force funds are transferred to the FHWA via Standard Form 1151, Non-
     expenditure Transfer Authorization, to proceed with project design and construction.
  3.7.3. Energy Conservation Program. Public laws Title 10, United States Code, Parts
  2912- 2913 allow the installation to share in savings from energy reductions. One-half of the
  savings remain at the installation to be used for maintenance and repair; minor alterations to
  existing military family housing units (with family housing energy savings); unspecified
  minor construction projects that enhance quality of life; or morale, welfare, or recreation
  (MWR) facilities/services that can be supported with appropriated funds. The other half of
  the savings is to be used for additional energy conservation measures. This portion is to be
  accumulated and managed by the MAJCOM/DRU. Refer to DOD 7000.14-R, Volume 12,
  Chapter 12 for further guidance.
     3.7.3.1. Normal MILCON. Energy projects may be MILCON-funded as outlined in
     paragraph 3.4. of this Instruction.
     3.7.3.2. Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP). ECIP is a special
     MILCON program centrally managed by OSD for all services. The program is submitted
     to Congress by OSD as a lump sum amount without base or project identification. The
     services compete for portions of the lump sum amount by submitting candidate projects
     with detailed justifications to OSD. The program is intended to provide projects that
     reduce energy consumption and utility costs. OSD reviews the projects, determines which
     are to be funded, and transfers funds to the service for project accomplishment. HQ
     USAF and the Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency (AFCESA) issue annual
     guidance letters to MAJCOM/DRUs for implementing this program.
         3.7.3.2.1. (Added-AFSC) A copy of all ECIP project requests shall be sent to
         AFSC/LGMI MILCON manager. AFSC MILCON manager will coordinate and
         submit to MAJCOM.
  3.7.4. Liquid Fuels Facilities. Liquid fuels facilities handling Defense Energy Support
  Center (DESC) owned product are the responsibility of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)
  for MILCON funding and advocacy. CONUS MAJCOMs submit MILCON fuels projects to
  Air Force Petroleum Agency (AFPET) for prioritization and final submission to DESC.
  AMC, AFCENT, USAFE, and PACAF submit their projects directly to their Combatant
  Commands (COCOM) TRANSCOM, CENTCOM, EUCOM, and PACOM respectively.
  These COCOMs will submit the MILCON fuels projects to DESC, which is documented in
  accordance with DLAM 4270.1, DLA Facilities Projects Manual, and DODM 4140.25, DOD
AFI32-1021_AFSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2013                                                               33


  Management of Bulk Petroleum Products, Natural Gas and Coal. Also, see AFI 23-201,
  Fuels Management and UFC 3-460-01, Petroleum Fuel Facilities, for additional guidance.
  Submit information copies to AF/A7CP/A7CA.
  3.7.5. Land Acquisition. Land acquisition guidance is included in AFI 32-9001,
  Acquisition of Real Property, dated 27 July, 1994. The Air Force Real Property Office
  (AFRPA) is the execution agency for land acquisition. Major land acquisitions are subject to
  the OSD policy on land acquisition and leasing. This policy states that proposals for major
  land acquisitions cannot be made public through a request for proposals, notice of intent to
  perform an environmental analysis or request for legislation or budget line item, press release
  or other official notice without approval of the Deputy Secretary of Defense. This is done by
  requesting a waiver of the land moratorium. Major land acquisitions are defined as the
  purchase, withdrawal from public domain, lease or permit from individuals or government
  entities or any other use agreement involving more than 1,000 acres, or land whose estimated
  purchase or annual lease price exceeds $1M. Land acquisition is accomplished in one of two
  ways:
     3.7.5.1. Land Acquisition Only. Land acquisitions not associated with any facility
     construction and estimated to cost more than $500,000 are programmed as separate
     MILCON projects. Examples include lands purchased for Air Installation Compatible
     Use Zones (AICUZ) or for explosive quantity/distance safety zones.
     3.7.5.2. Land Acquisition with Facility Construction. When land acquisition is
     required in conjunction with facility construction, the land acquisition is programmed one
     of two ways:
         3.7.5.2.1. If the estimated land cost is greater than 30 percent of the estimated total
         project cost (land plus facility construction), land acquisition is programmed as a
         single and separate MILCON project from the construction project.
         3.7.5.2.2. If the estimated land cost is 30 percent or less of the estimated total project
         cost, the project is programmed together with the construction and the words "land
         acquisition" are included in the project title on the DD Form 1391.
  3.7.6. North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Security Investment Program
  (NSIP). Facilities and equipment required to support U.S. NATO-assigned forces and
  NATO operational plans shall be funded, to the maximum extent possible, through the NSIP
  in accordance with latest version of DoDD 2010.5.
 34                                                   AFI32-1021_AFSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2013


                                            Chapter 4

              UNSPECIFIED MINOR CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMING

4.1. Unspecified Minor Construction. Unspecified minor construction (UMC) projects are
authorized by Title 10, United States Code, Section 2805, Unspecified Minor Construction. This
chapter implements DoDD 4270.5, DoD Military Construction.
4.2. Minor Construction Project Criteria. UMC projects are MILCON projects having a
funded cost between $750,000 and $2,000,000. However, if the UMC project is intended solely
to correct a life-threatening, health-threatening, or safety-threatening deficiency, the funded cost
is between $2,000,000 and $3,000,000. These projects are funded from the P-341 account or
from reprogrammed MILCON funds. AFI 32-1032, Planning and Programming Appropriated
Funded Maintenance, Repair, and Construction Projects, describes minor construction (funded
from the O&M account) projects costing less than $750,000 (or less than $1,500,000 where the
project corrects a life, safety, or health-threatening deficiency). In some cases where
contamination is found during construction, MILCON may be required to fund the cost of
environmental contamination. For details and requirements, refer to AFI 32-7020, The
Environmental Restoration Program, para. 3.6.
   4.2.1. Types of Projects. UMC includes MILCON projects as defined in para. 3.2 and
   repair-type work that exceed 75 percent of a building’s replacement cost. Note: when the
   estimated cost to repair a building exceeds 75 percent of the replacement cost, a replacement
   building should normally be programmed through the MILCON process. However, when
   other factors dictate retention and restoration of the existing building, such repair-type work
   is referred to as rehabilitation. SAF/IEI may approve repair projects exceeding 75% of a
   facility’s replacement cost on a case-by-case basis. Repair work in the same facility may be
   programmed as a separate project and executed with the UMC project. The programming
   documents for both projects shall be cross-referenced and Congress shall be notified of intent
   to proceed with an UMC project and companion repair work.
   4.2.2. Project Limitations. Unspecified Minor Construction requirements should be
   unforeseen and so urgent that the project cannot wait for the next MILCON program
   submittal. Each project shall provide a complete and usable facility or improvement to an
   existing facility. Splitting requirements to keep project costs below the UMC threshold is
   prohibited. An UMC project shall not be accomplished concurrently with a MILCON project
   in the same facility. An UMC project may precede a MILCON project for a new mission
   requirement when the UMC will provide a complete and usable facility to meet a specific
   need during a specific time frame. An UMC project may follow a MILCON project when
   new mission requirements are identified after the MILCON project was completed.
4.3. Project Justification and Submittal. MAJCOM/DRUs submit project requests under the
UMC authority to AF/A7CP using a DD Form 1391. Project requests shall describe the
requirement; explain the project urgency; why it was not included in a prior year MILCON
program; and why it cannot wait for the next MILCON program. Each project request shall
explain how the new requirement is to be satisfied in the interim. Requests shall identify any
land acquisition and temporary facilities; indicate the date when the requirement was first
known; and identify unit or activity relocations in submittal documents. Provide the required
AFI32-1021_AFSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2013                                                              35


completion date and justification for that completion date. Include a schedule of related
equipment delivery and any steps taken to expedite design and construction. If requesting minor
construction funding for a project previously denied by Congress, provide new information
justifying the urgency and what changed since the original request. Describe all actions taken to
satisfy the requirement and identify all other reasonable alternatives considered. Explain why the
alternatives were not adopted. Identify any O&M funded work associated with the total project
scope and provide copies of DD Form 1391 for any companion O&M project and cross-
reference DD Forms 1391 to each other. The MAJCOM/A7P shall sign the following statement,
included on the DD Form 1391, for all projects submitted to HQ USAF for authority approval: “I
have reviewed the DD Form 1391 and assure the document is complete and accurate, and have
validated the primary and supporting costs. The scope has been fully coordinated with the user
and the Civil Engineer Squadron Commander.” In the submittal, include a Certificate of
Compliance (Figure 2.1.) signed by the host installation commander and endorsed by the
MAJCOM commander, or designated representative.
4.3. (AFSC) Project Justification and Submittal. A copy of all UMC project requests shall be
sent to AFSC/LGMI MILCON manager for AFSC coordination. AFSC MILCON manager will
coordinate and submit to MAJCOM.
4.4. Project Approval. AF/A7CP validates UMC (P-341) projects and submits validated
projects to SAF/IEI for approval. SAF/IEI and the OSD Comptroller notify the House and Senate
Armed Services and Appropriations Committees of the intent to accomplish the project. If no
committee raises an objection within 21 calendar days (14 days if submitted electronically) after
notification, the notification process is complete, and AF/A7CP advises the MAJCOM/DRU and
AFCEE to proceed with the project. For the Air Force Reserve Components, AFRC/RE and
NGB/A7 have unspecified minor construction project approval up to $1,500,000. Projects
exceeding $1,500,000 require SAF/IEI approval and the same Congressional notification.
4.5. Project Execution. Installations have the lead role to design and construct P-341 projects.
AFCEE is available to assist with design/construction if requested by the host installation.

                                           Chapter 5

         EMERGENCY, DAMAGED OR DESTROYED, AND CONTINGENCY
                      CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS

5.1. Purpose of Chapter. This chapter provides guidance for obtaining MILCON projects
under certain special emergency program authorities. This chapter implements DoDD 4270.5,
Military Construction. Special programs include: Title 10, United States Code, Section 2803,
Emergency Construction; Title 10, United States Code, Section 2854, Restoration or
Replacement of Damaged or Destroyed Facilities; Title 10, United States Code, Section 2804,
Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) Contingency Construction; and Title 10, United States Code,
Section 2808, Construction Authority in Event of Declaration of War or National Emergency.
5.2. Special Construction Programs.
   5.2.1. Emergency Construction (10 USC § 2803). This provision is used for projects vital
   to national security or for the protection of health, safety, or the quality of the environment,
   so urgent they cannot be deferred to the next MILCON submittal.
       5.2.1.1. Project Justification and Submittal. MAJCOM/DRUs submit project
       justifications to AF/A7CP. The submittal shall include all requested information, a DD
       Form 1391, and a DD Form 1391c. The urgency of the project shall be explained,
       including the date the emergency arose and why it was not known in time for inclusion in
       the MILCON budget currently before Congress. The submittal shall also explain the
       impact on the installation mission if the urgent requirement is deferred until the next
       MILCON budget submission. Include design and contract award schedule data showing
       project award will be prior to availability of the next year's MILCON funds.
       5.2.1.1. (AFSC) A copy of all emergency construction project requests shall be sent to
       AFSC/LGMI MILCON manager. AFSC MILCON manager will coordinate and submit
       to MAJCOM.
       5.2.1.2. Funding. Emergency construction projects are funded from unobligated
       balances made available from authorized and appropriated MILCON programs. AFCEE
       and MAJCOM/DRUs will identify and use the oldest savings and cancellations from their
       MILCON projects, first. If these funds are insufficient to cover the cost of the emergency
       project, AF/A7CP will work to identify the balance of the requirement.
       5.2.1.3. Approvals Required. AF/A7CP validates the requirement and submits projects
       to SAF/IEI for approval and notification to the appropriate congressional authorization
       committees. Simultaneously, AF/A7CP, through SAF/FMB, requests OSD Comptroller
       seek approval from the Senate and House Appropriations Committees to reprogram the
       identified offsets to the emergency project. Correspondence is delivered to all committees
       simultaneously. A project may be carried out only if: (1) no objection is raised by the
       Armed Services Committees within 21calendar days after they were notified (14 days if
       filed electronically), and (2) approval from the Appropriations Committees is obtained
       for reprogramming funds. Emergency projects shall be accomplished within approved
       funds. If variations in cost occur that could not have been anticipated at the time of
38                                                  AFI32-1021_AFSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2013


     approval, the cost flexibility provision under Title 10, United States Code, Section 2853
     applies.
  5.2.2. Restoration or Replacement of Damaged or Destroyed Facilities. (10 USC §
  2854) This authority is used for facilities damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, wind, crashes,
  explosions, tornadoes, hurricanes, volcanoes, earthquakes, typhoons, etc. 10 USC § 2854
  provides authorization only (no appropriations). There is no annual dollar limit.
     5.2.2.1. Criteria for Projects. The destroyed or damaged facility shall have been in use
     or planned for use at the time of the damage or destruction. Restoration or replacement
     shall not provide larger facilities than those damaged or destroyed, except that
     MAJCOM/DRUs may provide for limited increases as a result of economy of design or
     compliance with new criteria. MAJCOM/DRUs cannot use these projects to correct space
     deficiencies.
     5.2.2.2. Operations and Maintenance Funds for Clean Up. MAJCOM/DRUs may
     clean up the damage and minimally restore the facility with Operations and Maintenance
     funds, provided construction class work does not exceed $750,000. MILCON funds, if
     subsequently approved for restoration or replacement of the facility, will not reimburse
     Operations and Maintenance accounts.
     5.2.2.3. Project Justification and Submittal. The submittal process for
     MAJCOM/DRUs is the same as for emergency projects (refer to paragraph 5.2.1.1.). In
     addition, the submittal shall explain the urgency and indicate, for each facility, the cause
     of damage or destruction. Include the building number, name, value before damage or
     destruction, size, and construction type. MAJCOM/DRUs shall certify the project is for
     restoration or replacement of facilities damaged or destroyed, and any scope increase is a
     result of economy of design or compliance with new criteria.
     5.2.2.3. (AFSC) Directly send all restoration or replacement of damaged or destroyed
     facilities project requests to MAJCOM A6/7. Courtesy copy (INFO) AFSC/LGMI
     MILCON manager on all damaged or destroyed facilities project request.
     5.2.2.4. Funding. Project funding is accomplished under the same procedures as for
     emergency construction projects (refer to paragraph 5.2.1.2.).
     5.2.2.5. Project Approval and Cost Limits. The approval process and limits on project
     cost are the same as for emergency projects (refer to paragraph 5.2.1.3.).
  5.2.3. Secretary of Defense Contingency Construction. (10 USC § 2804) Use of this
  authority is rare. Projects must be considered for funding under authorities available to the
  Secretary of the Air Force before being considered for funding under the authority of the
  Secretary of Defense.
     5.2.3.1. Project Justification. The Air Force shall first consider using its Emergency
     Construction Authority (10 USC § 2803) and provide reasons to the Secretary of Defense
     why that authority cannot be used. Use of Contingency Construction Authority does not
     require identification of funding from project cancellations or savings since
     appropriations are provided to the Secretary of Defense for this authority.
     5.2.3.2. Project Submittal. MAJCOM/DRUs shall submit requests according to DoDD
     4270.5. Requests should include the same information as required in paragraph 5.2.1.1. In
AFI32-1021_AFSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2013                                                         39


     addition, requests shall include Unified and Specified Commander's certification the
     project is vital to US Security. Factors making the project vital to the security of the
     United States shall be described in detail. Reasons the project cannot be programmed in
     accordance with established planning, programming, and budgeting system procedures,
     or accomplished using Air Force emergency construction authority shall be listed. Also,
     provide anticipated contract award and design completion dates.
     5.2.3.2. (AFSC) A copy of all SECDEF contingency construction project requests shall
     be sent to AFSC/LGMI MILCON manager. AFSC MILCON manager will coordinate
     and submit to MAJCOM.
  5.2.4. Construction Authority in the Event of Declaration of War or National
  Emergency. (10 USC § 2808) The Secretary of Defense may authorize the services to
  undertake military construction projects not otherwise authorized by law. The Air Force may
  undertake these projects only within the amount of funds appropriated. The Secretary of
  Defense will provide guidance at the time this authority is needed.
  5.2.5. Emergency Compliance with the EIAP. Emergency situations do not exempt the
  Air Force from complying with NEPA, but do allow emergency response while completing
  the EIAP (refer to 32 CFR § 989.34(b) & 40 CFR § 1506.11)

                                            Chapter 6

                    RELOCATABLE AND TEMPORARY FACILITIES

6.1. Relocatable and Temporary Use Facilities Background. This chapter pertains to
relocatable and temporary use facilities purchased or leased as equipment. For the purpose of this
chapter the terms temporary and relocatable are used interchangeably. The relocatable facilities
authority was a concession on the part of Congress to provide the DoD a way to satisfy
requirements that were so urgent they could not wait for normal processes to obtain construction
for a very short period with unsubstantial buildings. Over time, temporary structures were
erected that were more like permanent facilities than austere, relocatable structures. Austere
refers to both the exterior and interior appearance and is defined as the basic structure without
ornamentation or luxury and without the appearance of permanence. Current DoD and AF policy
is to keep relocatable facilities to an absolute minimum; as short-term as possible; and only in
use until the permanent facility is built or the mission no longer requires their use. This chapter
provides guidance on satisfying interim facility requirements using relocatable or temporary
facilities. Interim facilities are requirements resulting from transitory or peak military missions,
deployments, contingency operations, disaster relief operations, or urgent requirements pending
approval and construction of permanent facilities through the normal MILCON process. Leased
facilities must meet energy intensity requirements of EISA 2007. Detailed guidelines for
construction of relocatable and temporary facilities in a contingency environment are specified in
Combatant Command construction and base development regulations; see also para. 6.2.5.3.
6.2. Relocatable Facilities. DoD Instruction 4165.56, Relocatable Buildings, authorizes the
purchase or lease of relocatable buildings to meet interim facility requirements. It provides the
authority to acquire, store, and use relocatable facilities when they are the most feasible and
economical means of satisfying interim facility requirements.
   6.2.1. Definition. A relocatable building is designed to be readily erected, disassembled,
   stored, moved, and reused.
       6.2.1.1. Interim Facility Requirement. A short-term, normally 3 years or less,
       requirement for facilities due to either;
           6.2.1.1.1. Transitory peak military missions, deployments, military contingency
           operations, or diaster relief requirements.
           6.2.1.1.2. Urgent requirements pending approval; construction of facilities via
           normal military construction programs.
   6.2.2. Restrictions on Relocatable Facilities. MAJCOM/DRUs and ANG shall keep
   relocatable facilities to a minimum. MAJCOM/DRUs and ANG shall ensure these facilities
   are neat in appearance, functional yet austere, and readily removable. There shall be no
   appearance of permanence, such as brick exteriors, brick building signs, automatic sprinkler
   systems, or extensive landscaping.
       6.2.2.1. Stress tension shelters (STS) or fabric covered structures having a rigid frame
       cannot be purchased as equipment per specific direction of Congress. Therefore, they
       cannot be purchased with 3400 (O&M) or 3080 funds. The FY86 House Appropriation
       report 99-275 restricted the purchased of Rigid Frame Tensioned Fabric Structures as
AFI32-1021_AFSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2013                                                              41


     equipment. The FY86 appropriation conference report 99-380 later upheld the house
     opinion. In the Committees opinion, the definition clearly dictates that modular structures
     be budgeted as military construction line items. The costs of the structures themselves
     and supporting features of construction should be combined into one line item in the
     military construction (MILCON, P-341, or O&M funded minor construction). This
     procedure is to apply to U. S. military installations worldwide.
  6.2.3. Facilities Not Classified as Relocatable. The following facility types are not
  classified as relocatable:
     6.2.3.1. Facilities required solely for military training associated with facility use and
     assembly.
     6.2.3.2. Buildings that are part of organizational unit mobility equipment, War Reserve
     Material (WRM), or an integral part of a mobile equipment item such as shop,
     communications, and instrumentation vans or trailers.
     6.2.3.3. Portable facilities that can be moved intact (such as shelters for workmen), skid-
     mounted bus shelters, contractor owned construction project offices, small storage sheds
     not connected to a utility system, and unconnected sanitary facilities or sentry shelters.
  6.2.4. Approval Authority. SAF/IEI delegated authority to The Civil Engineer, AF/A7C,
  to approve the use of relocatable facilities longer than three years. AF/A7C further delegated
  this authority to the MAJCOM/A7C (including NGB/A7). This authority may not be further
  delegated.
  6.2.5. Program Management. To improve visibility of peak and short-term facility
  management, all MAJCOM/DRUs and ANG shall submit a comprehensive list of short-term
  facilities highlighting those approved for longer than five years or which have been on the
  installation less than five years, but were granted an extension to exceed five years. Submittal
  is required annually in response to the annual AF/A7CP call letter. The program management
  procedures outlined in this Instruction apply to all relocatable facilities purchased or leased
  as equipment.
     6.2.5.1. Approval for Relocatable Facilities Interim to MILCON. The requiring
     MAJCOM/DRU shall identify the permanent MILCON or UMC project for which the
     relocatable facility is interim. The MILCON project shall be identified in the next
     available MILCON budget submittal to AF/A7CP.
     6.2.5.2. Approval of Relocatable Facilities for Peak or Transitory
     Purposes. Installations shall submit requests for use of relocatable buildings for peak or
     transitory purposes to MAJCOM/DRUs. The MAJCOM/DRU validates the requirement,
     and if warranted, the MAJCOM/A7 approves the purchase or lease. The Command shall
     identify the mission for which the temporary relocatable facility is required.
     6.2.5.3. Approval of Relocatable Facilities for Contingency Environments. Refer to
     guidelines provided in AFI 32-1032, Planning and Programming Appropriated Funded
     Maintenance, Repair, and Construction Projects, Chapter 7, “Facilities for Operational
     Requirements.”
  6.2.6. Acquisition of Relocatable Facilities. Installations shall submit a DD Form 1391 to
  the MAJCOM/DRU or ANG for acquisition of a relocatable facility showing all costs
42                                                   AFI32-1021_AFSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2013


  (funded and unfunded) associated with the purchase or lease, with a separate entry for the
  construction support costs. An economic analysis (refer to paragraph 6.2.6.3.) and 20 percent
  rule calculations (refer to paragraph 6.2.7.) shall be included in the submittal. They can be
  reused by another organization at the same site or at another site on another installation.
     6.2.6.1. Funded Costs (Non-recoverable Costs). Funded costs may not exceed
     $750,000 for either purchased or leased relocatable facilities. These costs cannot be
     included in a lease; they shall be funded as a Minor Construction project. Funded (Non-
     recoverable) facility components include, but are not limited to; foundations, concrete
     mounting slabs, site preparation, utility connections, stairways, porches or breezeways
     between units, extra wall covering and paneling, ceramic works, lighting and sound
     systems, and other interior and exterior finishes and features not included in the original
     facility package or unit.
     6.2.6.2. Unfunded Costs (Acquisition Costs). Unfunded costs include relocatable
     facility acquisition, leasing, delivery to the site, erection, assembly, disassembly,
     packaging, transporting, maintenance, operation, and refurbishment. Relocatable facilities
     are purchased as equipment using Other Procurement funds (3080) or with Research,
     Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) funds (3600) when appropriate. When
     relocatable facilities are leased, installations and MAJCOM/DRUs will lease them as
     equipment with Operations and Maintenance funds (3400) (3830 and 3730 for ANG and
     AFRC, respectively) or RDT&E funds (3600).
     6.2.6.3. Economic Analysis Requirement. Installations shall prepare an economic
     analysis to support acquisition of relocatable facilities according to the guidelines in AFI
     65-501, Economic Analysis. Prior to exercising annual options to continue leasing interim
     facilities, the economic analysis shall be updated and revalidated.
     6.2.6.4. Engineering Evaluation Requirement. An engineering evaluation shall be
     performed to ensure the relocatable facility meets safety requirements and normal
     construction standards established by the Air Force.
  6.2.7. The 20 Percent Rule. Prior to approving a request for a relocatable facility,
  MAJCOM/DRU/ANG shall calculate the percentage of non-recoverable (funded) costs to
  facility acquisition (unfunded) costs. For purposes of this calculation, the non-recoverable
  costs include both the funded costs and the costs of average building disassembly and
  repackaging (including normal repair and refurbishment of components). This percentage
  shall not exceed 20 percent. The 20 percent calculation equals "non-recoverable facility
  component cost" divided by "facility acquisition cost" times "100". If the facility is not new
  (including facilities acquired from other governmental agencies), apply the "20 percent rule"
  to the current cost of a similar new facility instead of the original cost of the facility or its
  current cost to the Air Force. The 20 percent calculation shall also be performed for leased
  relocatable facilities (obtain appropriate data from the lessor). If the calculation results in a
  percentage greater than 20 percent, consider a different type of relocatable that complies with
  the 20 percent rule.
  6.2.8. Conversion to Real Property. Conversion of a purchased or leased relocatable
  building to Air Force real property requires SAF/IEI approval.
AFI32-1021_AFSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2013                                                                43


       6.2.8.1. Conversion of Purchased Relocatable Facilities Where Funded and
       Unfunded Costs Exceed $750,000. MAJCOM/DRUs shall submit a DD Form 1391 to
       AF/A7CP describing the project and showing all costs. A7CP will request SAF/IEI
       approval. SAF/IEI approves the project and notifies the House and Senate Armed
       Services and Appropriations Committees of the AFs intent to convert the facility. If no
       committee raises an objection within 21 days after notification (14 days if filed
       electronically), the notification process is complete, and HQ USAF advises the
       MAJCOM/DRU to proceed with the project. AF/A7CP will resolve any objection, if
       raised, prior to proceeding. ANG installations will submit documentation described above
       to NGB/A7 for processing to SAF/IEI.
       6.2.8.2. Conversion of Purchased Relocatable Facilities Where Funded and
       Unfunded Cost is Less than $750,000. MAJCOM/DRU staffs shall submit detailed
       justifications, including data on funded and unfunded costs, to AF/A7CP for conversion
       approval. AF/A7CP will notify commands of approval or disapproval. ANG installations
       will submit documentation described above to NGB/A7 for approval.
       6.2.8.3. Conversion of Leased Relocatable Facilities. This type of conversion involves
       complex fiscal and legal procedures and should rarely arise. MAJCOM/DRU staffs shall
       submit requests for such conversions to AF/A7CP for appropriate processing.
   6.2.9. Maintenance of Relocatable Facilities. Purchases or leases of relocatable facilities,
   as equipment and not real property, dictate O&M funds or RDT&E funds pay the cost of
   maintenance. When leased, the lease can stipulate that the lessor provides maintenance. The
   using organization is responsible for funding the maintenance cost of their relocatable
   facilities. The BCE is responsible for funding the maintenance cost of the real property
   associated with the relocatable (e.g., the foundations, site preparation, and utility
   connections).
   6.2.10. Inventory, Reuse and Disposition of Relocatable Facilities. Purchased relocatable
   facilities are accounted for as equipment. MAJCOM/DRUs and ANG shall keep an accurate
   and current inventory of purchased, stored, and inactivated relocatable facilities. Installations
   shall determine if a suitable relocatable asset is available through the MAJCOM/DRU before
   purchasing any new relocatable building.
6.3. Temporary Facilities Incident to MILCON. These are short-term facilities required to
accommodate activities displaced by an approved and funded MILCON project during the period
of project execution. Facilities shall be of non-permanent construction and removed when the
MILCON project is completed and the permanent facility occupied. Relocatable facilities can be
used to satisfy these temporary requirements. The cost of temporary facilities (building,
foundations, site preparation, and utilities) is a funded cost and shall be included as a supporting
facility on the DD Form 1391 for the MILCON project. If leased, the full cost of the lease shall
be included on the DD Form 1391. The lease cost will reflect the period when the facility being
constructed will not be available. If the requirement for temporary facilities arises after award of
the MILCON project, it must be handled as a construction modification action. Temporary
facility costs shall be included in the project life cycle cost analysis used to validate the
construction project.

Terms
Finding of No Practicable Alternative (FONPA)—A finding contained in a Finding of No
Significant Impact (FONSI) or Record of Decision (ROD) indicating that the Air Force has
evaluated practicable alternatives to siting in a floodplain or a wetland and that there is no other
practicable alternative to taking the action in the floodplain or wetland. This finding is based on a
rigorous analysis contained in the supporting EA or EIS.
Funded and Unfunded Costs— Definitions of funded and unfunded costs are as follows:
Funded Project Costs—Costs incurred during the construction phases are funded costs and are
funded from MILCON appropriations or O&M funded minor construction accounts. Funded
costs include, but are not limited to, the following:
MAJCOM/DRU—Some Direct Reporting Units (DRUs) manage MILCON programs and must
follow the same submittal procedures as MAJCOMs. The US Air Force Academy and the Air
Force District of Washington are examples of DRUs that manage MILCON programs.
Materials—All materials, supplies, and services applicable to the project.
AFI32-1021_AFSCSUP_I 30 JULY 2013                                                           51


Equipment—All items of installed capital equipment.
Transportation—Transportation costs applicable to materials, supplies, installed capital type
equipment, and government-owned equipment.
Labor—All civilian labor costs including labor costs of construction units composed of foreign
nationals. These funded civilian labor costs for a project are determined by the accounting
system in Work Information Management System (WIMS)/ACES that uses the appropriate shop
rate in its calculation. Installation staffs shall not use any method other than this WIMS/ACES
accounting procedure to compute civilian labor funded costs. Otherwise, incomplete project
costs and subsequent non-compliance with minor construction funding limits might occur.
Overhead—That portion of installation overhead or support costs that can be identified as
representing additional costs incurred as a result of the project.
Supervision, Inspection and Overhead—The costs charged by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, and the Air Force when serving as the
design and/or construction agent.
Travel—All travel and per diem costs.
Equipment Operation—That portion of costs applicable to the operation and maintenance of
government-owned equipment. Such costs shall be computed on an hourly rate (shown in AFI
65-601V1).
Unfunded Costs—Some efforts in support of military construction are identified as unfunded
costs. Unfunded costs are those that (a) are part of the construction effort associated with a
military construction or O&M funded minor construction project, (b) are financed from
appropriations other than MILCON or O&M funded minor construction, and (c) are not
reimbursed by appropriations available for MILCON. Unfunded costs are capitalized as part of
the real property investment and include the following:
Military Labor—Military labor costs used for a project are unfunded. These unfunded military
labor costs are determined by the accounting system in WIMS/ACES that uses the shop rate in
its calculation. Installation staffs shall not use any method other than the WIMS/ACES
accounting procedure to compute these unfunded military labor costs. Otherwise, incomplete
project costs and subsequent noncompliance with minor construction funding limits might occur.
RED HORSE and Prime BEEF Units—The labor costs of Red Horse and Prime Beef units are
unfunded. These are costs for all labor performed by these units on a project. These costs are
computed directly from the labor performed and use of the shop rate is not applicable.
Depreciation—Costs applicable to the depreciation of government-owned equipment in
accordance with hourly rates determined in Chapter 26 of DoD Manual 7220.9-M, "Asset Use
Charge."
Materials—Materials, supplies, and items of installed capital equipment obtained specifically
for a project on a non-reimbursable basis, either as excess distributions from another Military
Department of Defense Agency or as excess distributions from other Government agencies. A
military Department of Defense Agency is precluded from using materials, supplies, or items of
installed capital type equipment on its own minor construction projects on a non-reimbursable
basis.

Fringe Benefits—Unfunded civilian fringe benefit rates as prescribed in Chapter 9 of AFI 65-
601, Volume I, for DoD civilian personnel.
Gifts—Gifts from private parties.
