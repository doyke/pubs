                                             Chapter 1

                                     GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. Purpose. The purpose of this instruction is to provide guidance to understand and utilize
DRRS to meet reporting responsibilities. In compliance with Title 10 United States Code
(U.S.C.) Section 117, DRRS is intended to be the sole readiness reporting system for the
Department of Defense (DoD) in the future, and as such, DRRS is used by the Office of the
Secretary of Defense (OSD), Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), Combatant
Commands (CCMDs), Services, and Combat Support Agencies. DRRS establishes a
capabilities-based, adaptive, near real-time readiness reporting system for the DoD to measure
the readiness of military units to meet missions and goals assigned by the Secretary of Defense
(SecDef).
1.2. General. The initial authorization to develop the DRRS application came from DoDD
7730.65, which called for the establishment of a readiness assessment network to calculate the
capabilities and preparedness of military units to conduct wartime missions and other
contingencies. As a capabilities-based system, DRRS indicates what tasks a unit can
accomplish, based upon the mission(s) for which a unit was organized or designed. DRRS
provides this information on measured units at a specific point in time. This information
supports crisis planning, deliberate planning, and management responsibilities to organize, train,
and equip combat-ready forces for the Combatant Commanders (CCDRs). DRRS data will be
used as part of the Global Force Management and Adaptive Planning and Execution processes.
DRRS provides the CJCS and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) an assessment of unit
information to achieve adequate and feasible military responses to crisis situations. The Air
Force (AF) uses DRRS information in assessing readiness, determining budgetary allocation and
management action impacts on unit level readiness, answering congressional inquiries, analyzing
readiness trends, and supporting readiness decisions.
     1.2.1. DRRS will not be used as input for the performance appraisal of a unit or a unit
     commander. However, unit commanders are ultimately responsible for all unit data and
     readiness assessments that appear in the unit’s DRRS account.
     1.2.2. DRRS measurement criteria (Mission Essential Tasks (METs) / Mission Essential
     Task Lists (METLs)) are the basis for capabilities-based readiness reporting. Standard
     measurement criteria are necessary to provide similarly capable/trained units globally.
     Where units present unique capabilities above the standard measurement criterion,
     MAJCOMs may supplement the unit’s Core METL with additional METs and/or
     performance standards. Where units do not possess the full capability reflected in the
     standard measurement criterion, MAJCOMs may delete those METs and/or performance
     standards that do not apply from the unit’s Core METL. Unit commanders or their designated
     alternates, assess measurements against the unit’s mission to provide a realistic indication of
     the unit’s readiness with the intent of informing higher headquarters. It is critical that unit
     commanders identify those areas that are rated less than desired in order to promote and
     justify corrective action (including funding, personnel, and equipment allocations). A
     fundamental premise of DRRS reporting is integrity. Commanders must “tell it like it is” and
     not allow masking of deficiencies to affect their ability to provide capability or other
AFI10-252_USAFESUP_I 15 AUGUST 2013                                                           5


   readiness related information. Risk must be balanced with responsibility.           Effective
   management of unit resources requires accurate information at all levels.
   1.2.3. MAJCOMs may supplement this guidance. In the event of conflict between this AFI
   and MAJCOM Supplements or CCDR guidance, this instruction will take precedence.
1.3. References. All of the latest updates, training documents, checklists, and other references
can be obtained by contacting the HAF Operational Readiness Division (AF/A3O-IR).
1.4. DRRS Data Management. DRRS draws data from many authoritative data sources.
Unique AF data requirements, not currently covered by DRRS, should be forwarded to AF/A3O-
IR through MAJCOM Readiness Offices for submittal to the Office of the Under Secretary of
Defense for Personnel and Readiness (OUSD/P&R) for consideration and possible inclusion in
upcoming software releases.
1.5. DRRS Measured Units. All units with an AF Personnel Accounting Symbol will be
registered in the Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) until such time as DRRS is
capable of entering Basic Identity Data Element (BIDE) information directly. All units that are
required to report in SORTS will report on METL(s) in DRRS. Additionally, NAFs and
MAJCOMs will make an individual DRRS assessment. Wings and groups may report in DRRS
to include their own organic capabilities (i.e., wing staff agencies).
   1.5.1. DRRS measured units will assess their designed capabilities (Core) readiness in
   accordance with (IAW) their AF standardized unit/functional area Core METL provided in
   the Air Force Universal Task List (AFUTL) – Core METL document (Secret Internet
   Protocol Router (SIPR) document). MAJCOMs/NAFs can select tasks from the AFUTL or
   Universal Joint Task List (UJTL) for use in their Core METL. DRRS measured units will
   assess readiness against Core, Named Operations (if applicable), and Top Priority Plans (if
   applicable). Measured unit DRRS assessments begin as soon as possible after a unit
   activates and continue until the unit is inactivated.
       1.5.1.1. (Added-USAFESUP) All USAFE measured DRRS units will assess against
       Core, Named Operations and tasked plans (WMP-3, part 1), as applicable.
       1.5.1.2. (Added-USAFESUP) Newly measured units will begin assessing in DRRS
       within 24 hours of the “Effective Date” of their Status of Recourses and Training System
       (SORTS) Designed Operational Capability (DOC) Statement, or when directed by
       Headquarters Air Force (HAF) or USAFE.
       1.5.1.3. (Added-USAFESUP) Unit’s Core mission will be based off of the units DOC
       statement.
   1.5.2. All DRRS measured units (Active, Guard, and Reserve) will complete MET/mission
   assessments to include performance standard(s) monthly, no later than (NLT) the 15th of
   each month, and will continuously monitor and report changes in the unit's Mission-readiness
   level and individual MET readiness; significant changes in the unit Mission assessment
   and/or MET readiness levels will be reported within 24 hours. Units will continue to report
   in DRRS when committed to combat operations (i.e. located in a combat zone), when on
   Temporary Duty (TDY) for training, when involved in local training (base exercises, base
   inspections, etc.), or deployed.
 6                                                 AFI10-252_USAFESUP_I 15 AUGUST 2013


        1.5.2.1. (Added-USAFESUP) All DRRS measured units will submit their monthly
        DRRS assessment beginning on the 1st at 0001Z, with all reports updated in the DRRS
        database no later than the 5th at 2359Z of each month, or within 24 hours of a significant
        change. Each monthly assessment will be completed prior to the HAF requirement of the
        15th of each month. The Wing DRRS Point of Contact (POC) must request a waiver from
        the USAFE Readiness Measures Office prior to 2359Z if they cannot complete their
        assessment within the established timeline.
        1.5.2.2. (Added-USAFESUP) Due to the sequential nature of DRRS reporting it is
        extremely important that assessments are completed on time. Each assessment is used to
        assist in making further assessments beginning at the unit level up to the MAJCOM. In
        order for HQ USAFE and HQ AFAFRICA to complete the HAF/EUCOM/AFRICOM
        assessments, units are required to update between the 1st-5th, HQ FAM/SMEs will update
        between the 6th-10th, and USAFE/A3RR will compete the overall USAFE and
        AFAFRICA assessment for COMUSAFEs approval by the 15th of each month. This
        timeline must be enforced in order for the MAJCOM to complete accurate and timely
        assessments.
1.6. DRRS Data Classification. MET assessment levels (i.e. Yes, Qualified Yes, and No),
mission assessment levels, and limiting factors are classified SECRET. The association of the
unit with its Operations Plan (OPLAN) tasking is normally classified at the level of classification
of the OPLAN. Classified material exceeding the classification of the DRRS Database
(SECRET) will not be entered into DRRS.
     1.6.1. Worksheets/briefing materials reflecting measured unit data will be given the same
     classification level as the material from which it was derived. Although sources used to
     compile a unit’s DRRS report may be unclassified, once compiled and associated with DRRS
     ratings, it becomes classified at the highest level associated with the data.
     1.6.2. Composite or aggregate data will be classified at the same or higher level as the
     highest classified component of data.
     1.6.3. Derivative Classification. Derivative classification is the incorporating, paraphrasing,
     restating, or generating, in a new form, already classified information and marking newly
     developed material consistent with the classification that applies to the source information.
     Persons applying derivative classification markings must carry forward to any newly created
     document the classification markings from the original source.
     1.6.4. Classification Authority.       The OSD DRRS database is classified SECRET.
     Information extracted from this database is classified by CJCSI 3401.02B, Chairman of the
     Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual (CJCSM) 3150.02B, Global Status of Resources and Training
     System (GSORTS), or by the reporting organization (i.e., the Air Force). Information
     extracted from the database must contain derivative classification markings consistent with
     DoDM 5200.01, DoD Information Security Program: Protection of Classified Information,
     except where authorized otherwise. Derivative classification rules apply when extracts
     contain exempted data. If no classification authority source exists, use CJCSM 3150.02 as
     the classification authority. Use "Derived From: CJCSM 3150.02, Global Status of
     Resources and Training System (GSORTS), Declassify On: (date)” to mark material when
     this reference is used as classification guidance. The date of declassification is 10 years from
     the date of the original classification decision, unless the original classification authority
AFI10-252_USAFESUP_I 15 AUGUST 2013                                                             7


   otherwise determines that the sensitivity of the information requires that it be marked for
   declassification for up to 25 years from the date of the original classification decision. The
   reporting headquarters will determine the downgrading of classified material on a case-by-
   case basis. If other sources direct a classification higher or for a longer period, list the
   classification guidance as the authority and list the specific sources on the file copy.
   Information that is not Enhanced Status of Resources and Training System (ESORTS) based
   and does not show a deficiency may still require classification through channels other than
   ESORTS. Unit and wing security managers and the Chief, Information Protection (wing or
   MAJCOM-level) should be consulted in these events. At a minimum, all classified
   documents will be properly marked with the overall classification on the top and bottom.
   Notebooks, binders, folders, etc. containing classified documents will be conspicuously
   marked with the highest classification of the material contained. Affix the appropriate overall
   classification marking or classified cover sheet to the front and back of the notebook, binder,
   folder, etc. (IAW AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management).
       1.6.4.1. All working papers must contain highest overall classification, destroyed when
       no longer needed, and if kept more than 180 days, marked as a finished document.
       Working papers are documents and material accumulated or created in the preparation of
       finished documents and material. This is IAW AFI 31-401.
   1.6.5. Downgrading Authority. Downgrading of DRRS data and aggregate information will
   be determined by the reporting headquarters IAW CJCSI 3401.02B. The authority resides
   with Headquarters Air Force, AF/A3/5, Director of Operations, Plans, and Requirements.
   AF/A3/5 will review classified ESORTS data and ascertain whether the classification level
   still applies and will determine the downgrading of classified material on a case-by-case

                                           Chapter 3

                              ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS

3.1. General Rules. Unit’s MET/mission assessments will require close integration of
OPLANs, Concept of Operations (CONOPS), FAM expertise, training, evaluations, inspections,
exercises, and those SMEs responsible for different aspects of a unit’s readiness. The MET OPRs
draw on their subject matter expertise, and the unit's ability to perform the task when making
MET readiness assessments. Commanders should use the MET readiness assessments and
consider the results of training, evaluations, inspections, exercises, and their SORTS and Air and
Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) Unit Type Code Reporting Tool (ART) reports to support
their mission assessment(s). The capabilities-based approach identifies the responsibilities of
individuals and organizations in the form of tasks, conditions, and performance standards. The
assessment of resulting performance is captured in ESORTS in the form of MET/mission
assessments to validate AF and Joint training and indicate unit task/mission readiness.
Commanders will cross-check their SORTS and DRRS assessments. SORTS complements and
informs MET and mission area readiness assessments in DRRS. If the assessments are not
aligned (e.g., C-4 in SORTS and ‘Y’ for a DRRS Core mission assessment), then provide an
explanatory remark in the applicable DRRS mission assessment, and explain the reason for the
difference in layman’s terms IAW paragraph 3.6.
3.2. Task Readiness Assessments. Commanders are responsible for assessing their unit’s
ability to accomplish the tasks (METs) to prescribed performance standards under specified
conditions. This assessment should be informed by observed performance, resource availability
(i.e., SORTS), and military experience and judgment. However, when observed performance is
not recent, assessed performance will be used. The currency of observed performance depends
on many factors: complexity of tasks, the type of exercise, size, unit personnel changeover,
experience, etc. The ultimate authority is the commander.
   3.2.1. All assessments will be documented in accordance with the following definitions:
       3.2.1.1. "Yes" (Y/Green):     Unit can accomplish task to established standard(s) and
       condition(s).
       3.2.1.2. “Qualified Yes" (Q/Yellow): Unit can accomplish most of the task to
       standard(s) under most conditions. The specific standard(s) and conditions that cannot be
       met as well as shortfalls or issues impacting the unit's ability to accomplish the task must
       be clearly detailed in the MET assessment.
       3.2.1.3. "No" (N/Red): Unit is unable to accomplish the task to prescribed standard(s)
       and condition(s) at this time.
   3.2.2. Commanders will assess a current status and an anticipated status.
   3.2.3. Remarks are mandatory whenever a "Qualified Yes" or "No" assessment is used, or a
   "Yes" assessment is used when guidelines would indicate a "Qualifed Yes" or "No."
3.3. Staff Supporting Tasks, Subordinate Unit Tasks, and Command-Linked Tasks. As
applicable, unit commanders/MAJCOMs/FAMs may use assessments of their subordinate units,
internal staffs, or other pre-designated external supporting organizations to inform their own
AFI10-252_USAFESUP_I 15 AUGUST 2013                                                         25


MET assessments. This information is derived from staff supporting tasks, subordinate unit
tasks, and command-linked tasks.
   3.3.1. A staff supporting task is performed by the organization’s internal staff elements.
   OPRs will work with staff elements in determining appropriate tasks, conditions, and
   standards. Staff supporting task OPRs are assigned. As with METs, these tasks should
   strongly connect to the mission – they should not be routine activities, such as keeping the
   facility clean, maintaining computers, conducting training (unless one of these is the
   organization’s mission), etc.
   3.3.2. A subordinate unit task is performed by organizations one level below a MET owner
   and in the same chain of command. The MET owner identifies subordinate unit task(s) from
   the linked unit’s existing METL that are essential to accomplishing the MET. If the
   appropriate task, conditions, and standards cannot be identified, the higher headquarters
   coordinates with the subordinate unit headquarters to determine how to identify the required
   support.
   3.3.3. A command-linked task is performed by organizations external to the MET owner’s
   chain of command. The MET owners identify command-linked tasks directly from the
   linked unit’s existing METL. If the appropriate task, conditions, and standards cannot be
   identified, the linking organization coordinates directly with the service component /
   headquarters or agency to identify the required support. Command linking is normally done
   across equivalent levels of command (e.g., an operational unit linking to maintenance unit
   MET(s)). However, by exception, command linking can be made at different levels provided
   both organizations agree and the linking is coordinated.
   3.3.4. The MET assessment guidelines with regard to staff-supporting, subordinate-unit, and
   command-linked tasks, in addition to MET performance standards assessment, are as
   follows:
       3.3.4.1. “Yes” (Y/Green): If the majority of the MET supporting tasks are assessed as
       "Y," and the remaining supporting tasks are assessed as "Q," then the MET assessment
       should be "Y."
       3.3.4.2. “Qualified Yes” (Q/Yellow): If the majority of the MET supporting tasks are
       assessed as "Q," and the remaining supporting tasks are assessed as "Y," then the MET
       assessment should be "Q."
       3.3.4.3. “No” (N/Red): If any of the MET supporting tasks are assessed as “No,” then
       the commander must make a judgment as to whether the mission objectives can still be
       accomplished. If the commander makes a subjective upgrade for an overall mission
       assessment to anything other than “No,” the commander will clearly explain how the
       mission will be accomplished despite the inability to accomplish the MET(s) and any
       mitigation actions that will be taken.
       3.3.4.4. The above guidelines are subject to unit commander's judgment/weighting of
       supporting tasks.
3.4. Mission Assessment Categories. All measured units will accomplish a mission
assessment(s) by reporting their ability to accomplish METs and their associated conditions and
standards – referred to as a METL. METLs provide the means for a commander to assess the
 26                                               AFI10-252_USAFESUP_I 15 AUGUST 2013


organizations ability to conduct their designed and assigned mission(s) with a focus on the
capabilities units provide to CCMDs. The assessment of resources (e.g., SORTS) informs
METL assessments, and commanders (if their unit assesses in SORTS) will consider the
resources they report in SORTS in the readiness assessment of their Core METL/mission. There
are three categories of mission assessments that are used to reflect the unit’s capabilities: Core,
Named Operations, and Top Priority Plans (Level IV). The Core category relates to the
“designed” mission of the unit, while the Named Operations and Top Priority Plans categories
relate to the “assigned” mission(s) of the unit. Mission assessments inform both joint and Air
Force organizations and provide commanders readiness information and status.
   3.4.1. Core METL. A Core METL consists of the fundamental capabilities for which a unit was
   organized and designed. AF/A3O-IR maintains a standardized list of Core METL by unit type.
   Core METLs are part of the AFUTL document and can be accessed on SIPR
   (http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/sites/afog/operational_readiness/default.aspx). All measured
   units will assess a Core METL. Commanders will consider all unit-assigned resources
   (deployed and in-garrison) as available when assessing METs for the Core METL. For
   civilian personnel, use AFI 10-201 rules to determine if civilian personnel should be
   included in the the Core METL. If the personnel are included for SORTS, then include them
   for Core METL assessments.
   3.4.1. (USAFESUP) Personnel will be counted available unless the individual is assigned a
   DAV code with an availability determination of “Not Available” as defined in AFI 10-403.
   An availability determination with any expanding remarks will require further investigation
   by the commander to determine if they can be counted as available to meet their Core
   mission.
       3.4.1.1. Augmenting Core METL. Units will use the Core METL within the latest
       approved AFUTL.
           3.4.1.1.1. In special cases, a unit with an approved Core METL may provide a
           specialized capability not common to this type of unit. When this is the case, the
           MAJCOM, in coordination with the FAM (as identified in Attachment 3), will
           authorize the unit to add these specific tasks and/or task performance standards to the
           unit’s Core METL.          The MAJCOM operations readiness office will keep
           documentation of these Core METL modifications to include original date of
           approval and coordination with the FAM (as identified in Attachment 3).
           3.4.1.1.2. In other cases, a unit may not provide a capability that other like-type units
           provide. When this is the case, the MAJCOM, in coordination with the FAM (as
           identified in Attachment 3), will authorize the unit to delete these specific tasks
           and/or task performance standards from the unit’s Core METL. The MAJCOM
           operations readiness office will keep documentation of these Core METL
           modifications to include original date of approval and coordination with the FAM (as
           identified in Attachment 3).
       3.4.1.2. If the AFUTL does not contain a Core METL for a unit, then the unit will notify
       the MAJCOM readiness office. The MAJCOM operations readiness office will elevate
       this to AF/A3O-IR who will determine the approprate FAM (HAF or MAJCOM) to
       develop a Core METL.
AFI10-252_USAFESUP_I 15 AUGUST 2013                                                           27


     3.4.1.3. If a unit commander believes the unit’s AF-standard Core METL should be
     updated, then contact the MAJCOM readiness office who will elevate this to AF/A3O-IR.
  3.4.2. Named Operations METL. Named Operations are those operations designated by the
  President, Secretary of Defense, and/or the Joint Chiefs of Staff (e.g., Operation Enduring
  Freedom (OEF) and Operation Noble Eagle (ONE)). Measured units will assess a Named
  Operation METL for a full or partial unit deployment. However, units will only report
  against a Named Operation(s) if 5% or more of the unit is preparing to deploy or is deployed.
  Reporting is required no later than 120 calendar days prior to the deployment or upon receipt
  of an appropriate order -- Prepare to Deploy Order (PTDO), Deployment Order (DEPORD),
  notification from the Installation Deployment Officer, etc. Named Operation reporting
  continues until redeployment or release from orders for the assigned mission. While a
  Named Operation normally requires a unit to deploy away from its home station, Named
  Operation requirements can also apply to assigned missions which can be executed by a unit
  from its home station (e.g., ONE). When reporting against a Named Operation, a
  commander will only assess resources organic to the unit, and the assessment will only
  consider those assets directly supporting the Named Operation. For example, a unit might
  have 24 aircraft and 36 crews, but only 6 aircraft and 9 crews are supporting a Named
  Operation. The commander’s assessment would be for the 6 aircraft and 9 crews, and their
  ability to execute the Named Operation. If a unit uses loaned equipment, aircraft and/or
  personnel to complete a Named Operation, then the unit is meeting its Named Operation
  requirement. However, any impact to the unit’s ability to meet its full-spectrum mission(s)
  (i.e., the situation that created the need for loaned resources) should be addressed via the
  Core METL assessment. If a unit has resources preparing for a specific Named Operation in
  addition to other resources already deployed for the same Named Operation, that unit will
  assess the assets that are deployed, accompanied by commander’s remarks to show an
  assessment(s) of the resources preparing to deploy.
     3.4.2.1. A Named Operation METL assessment will not necessarily correlate with a
     unit’s Core METL assessment. Commanders must analyze the mission orders and then
     specify which of the METs in the unit’s Core METL will be assessed as part of the
     Named Operation METL. The Wing DRRS POC will assist units as required. A unit can
     assess all of the METs in the Core METL or a portion of the METs in the Core METL as
     the Named Operation METL. More information regarding METL development can be
     found in the AFUTL document which can be accessed on SIPR
     (http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/sites/afog/operational_readiness/default.aspx).
  3.4.3. Top Priority Plans METL. Top Priority Plan assessments are only required for Level
  IV plans as designated in the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan. Level IV plans are those with
  detailed Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD). Any unit assigned or sourced
  at execution to a Level IV plan will assess their ability to provide capabilities tasked in the
  plan and to execute the plan. Reporting of the Top Priority Plan continues until released
  from the Level IV plan.
     3.4.3.1. A Top Priority Plan mission assessment will not necessarily correlate with a
     unit’s Core mission assessment. Commanders must analyze the plan, and then specify
     which of the METs in the unit’s Core METL will be assessed as part of the plan’s METL.
     The Wing DRRS POC will assist units as required. A unit can assess all of the METs in
     the Core METL or a portion of the METs in the Core METL as the Top Priority Plan
 28                                              AFI10-252_USAFESUP_I 15 AUGUST 2013


       METL. More information regarding METL development can be found in the AFUTL
       document which can be accessed on SIPR (http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/sites/afog/
       operational_readiness/default.aspx).
       3.4.3.2. When assessing Top Priority Plans, units will count deployed assets (or those
       already committed/engaged at home station) as unavailable (e.g., unit personnel/aircraft
       supporting Operation Noble Eagle from home station, would be unavailable for a Top
       Priority Plan assessment). If a Top Priority Plan assessment is degraded (i.e., Q or N)
       due in part or in full to deployed assets, then commanders will clearly annotate this in the
       Top Priority Plan remark. In this case, personnel can review the unit’s Core METL
       assessment to get an overall readiness picture of the unit. Resources at exercises /
       training events will be counted as available.
   3.4.4. (Added-USAFESUP) UCs or directors assessing against multiple mission
   assessment categories (i.e. Core METL, Named Operations or Top Priority Plans) will use
   the following guidance when making their assessment:
       3.4.4.1. (Added-USAFESUP) UCs will monitor and rate each mission assessment
       category independently of one another, when tasked under more than one plan or Named
       Operation. Ratings will not correlate with one another but be standalone assessments for
       that specific mission capability.
       3.4.4.2. (Added-USAFESUP) Monitor the status of METLs for executed plans and
       assess other tasked plans accordingly.
       3.4.4.3. (Added-USAFESUP) For          assets/capabilities  deployed     outside     the
       EUCOM/AFRICOM AOR, each tasked plan within the specific unit will be rated as
       deployed/unavailable until returned. Prepare narrative remarks for any ratings less than
       Y/Green.
3.5. Mission Assessments. Mission assessments will also be based on the "Yes," "Qualified
Yes," or "No" basis, but will consider the mission as a whole. As such, this assessment should
reflect the commander’s military experience and judgment on all the tasks, MET assessments,
and factors that affect the unit’s ability to meet mission requirements.
   3.5.1. The following guidelines will be used to ensure consistent mission assessments:
       3.5.1.1. “Yes” (Y/Green): If the majority (51 percent) of the METs are assessed as
       “Yes,” and the remaining METs are assessed as “Qualified Yes,” then the overall
       assessment should be “Yes.”
       3.5.1.2. “Qualified Yes” (Q/Yellow): If the majority (51 percent) of the METs are
       assessed as “Qualified Yes,” and the remaining METs are assessed as “Yes,” then the
       overall mission assessment should be “Qualified Yes.”
       3.5.1.3. “No” (N/Red): If any of the METs are assessed as “No,” then the commander
       must make a judgment as to whether the mission objectives can still be accomplished. If
       the commander makes a subjective upgrade for an overall mission assessment to anything
       other than “No,” the commander will clearly explain how the mission will be
       accomplished despite the inability to accomplish the MET(s) and any mitigation actions
       that will be taken.
AFI10-252_USAFESUP_I 15 AUGUST 2013                                                             29


   3.5.2. Commanders will assess current status and a projected status for each METL being
   assessed.
       3.5.2.1. (Added-USAFESUP) Ensure the projected rating (whether up or down)
       includes an anticipated date for change.
   3.5.3. Remarks are mandatory whenever a "Qualified Yes" or "No" assessment is used, or a
   "Yes" assessment is used when guidelines would indicate a "Qualifed Yes" or "No."
   3.5.4. The "Yes”, "Qualified Yes", and "No" guidelines should guide the mission assessment
   decision; however, they are not a substitute for commander judgment and experience.
3.6. Preparing Narrative Remarks. Remarks are a critical component of readiness
assessments and are required whenever a "Qualified Yes" or "No" assessment is used, or a "Yes"
assessment is used when guidelines would indicate a "Qualifed Yes" or "No."
   3.6.1. Commanders will use the following format whenever “Q” and “N” assessments are
   used, and remarks for tasks will be formatted: issue, impact, fix, and get well date. In
   addition, if MAJCOMs/NAFs, etc. use the “Top Concerns” tab in DRRS follow this guidance
   for the remarks.
       3.6.1.1. Issue: Provide a thorough explanation of the issue using layman's terms. If the
       issue is resource-centric; e.g., lack of equipment on-hand, provide all appropriate details,
       such as part numbers, NSNs, nomenclature, quantity authorized, quantity on-hand,
       quantity on-order, expected delivery date, etc. In addition, include a remark date.
       3.6.1.2. Impact: Describe the mission impact providing a risk assessment when
       appropriate. Provide a layman's explanation of the mission impact.
       3.6.1.3. Fix: Identify those actions being taken or assistance needed to improve the unit's
       readiness. Identify previously requested assistance and remedial actions in progress;
       explain unit, wing, or MAJCOM actions taken to resolve shortfalls.
       3.6.1.4. Get Well Date (GWD): Using the date from the "Anticipated Change" section
       of the task or mission assessment as a reference, provide a realistic GWD for each
       remark.
   3.6.2. Use remarks to provide supporting information concerning unit assessments.
   3.6.3. Remarks must be checked and verified for accuracy each time a unit readiness
   assessment is approved. Remarks should be clear and concise, but not at the expense of the
   details needed. They must contain a detailed functional explanation of the situation to
   provide details needed for functional management. Revise content as necessary to maintain
   validity. Remove remarks that no longer apply.
       3.6.3.1. As DRRS is dynamic and remarks may change from assessment to assessment,
       do not refer to previous assessments. Do not submit remarks referencing other remarks.
       Each remark must stand on its own content.
       3.6.3.2. To eliminate confusion by DRRS customers, abbreviations should not be used,
       and acronyms must be spelled out once in each remark.
       3.6.3.3. Provide the classification for each remark, and ensure every paragraph is
       marked.

3.7. Direction for units with a mission change. When a unit is transitioning to another
mission, the unit will continue to assess its current METL until mission change is reflected in
SORTS (i.e., C-5 rules) per policy in AFI 10-201. Core METL will be developed and
coordinated in advance, if possible, by the POC listed in Attachment 3 and included in the next
update of the AFUTL by AF/A3O-IR. If a POC is not identified in Attachment 3, then AF/A3O-
IR will assign a POC to develop the METL.
3.8. Total Force Integration (TFI). The TFI units are critical to Air Force operations. They
are organizational constructs that functionally integrate units from the regular Air Force, Air
National Guard, and Air Force Reserve.
   3.8.1. Each unit in the association (host and associate) will independently assess their
   readiness in DRRS. The host and associate will each assess a Core METL. In some cases, a
   host or associate may not provide a capability that other like type units provide. In this case,
   MAJCOMs (IAW paragraph 3.4.1.1.) may delete that MET from that specific host or
   associate Core METL. The overall status of a combined host and associate TFI unit can be
   determined by reviewing DRRS assessments from both units and confirming this assessment
   through communication with the associated unit commanders.
   3.8.2. Wings with Operational Control (OPCON) of associate units will monitor and ensure
   associate unit(s) load appropriate Core METL in the associate unit's DRRS account and
   assess their mission readiness.

                                      METL GUIDANCE

4.1. NAF and MAJCOM Mission Assessments
   4.1.1. MAJCOMs and NAFs will assess a Core METL that covers their organize, train, and
   equip (OT & E) role.
   4.1.2. AF component headquarters (C-MAJCOMs and C-NAFs) will develop a Core METL,
   derived from CCMD JMETL(s), that includes the task(s) the AF provides in support of the
   CCMD JMETL. Components will have to do a mission analysis of the capabilities the AF
   provides to the CCMD and develop / report METL for Named Operation(s) and Top Priority
   Plan(s), as applicable. A component can assess all of the tasks in the Core METL or a
   portion of the tasks in the Core METL as the Named Operation(s) and Top Priority Plan(s)
   METL. Task(s) conditions and standards should be tailored to the specific Named Operation
   or Top Priority Plan. These METL(s) will generally consist of tasks at the Operational (OP)
   or Strategic Theater (ST) level, but can include tasks at other levels if necessary.
   4.1.3. The AFUTL-Core METL document (on SIPR) and CJCSM 3500.03C, Joint Training
   Manual for the Armed Forces of the United States contain guidance which can be applied to
   AF component, NAF, and MAJCOM METL building.
4.2. Installation METL.
   4.2.1. The Installation METL contains five METs: Airfield Operations; Munitions Supply,
   Storage, and Distribution; Petroleum, Oil, and Lubricants (POL); Unaccompanied Personnel
   Housing to include Temporary Lodging Facilities (TLFs); and Range Operations.
   Installations must submit a report annually or within 72 hours of a change as outlined below:
      4.2.1.1. A change in status resulting in a “No” assessment for any of the installation’s
      METs.
      4.2.1.2. New encroachment concerns or environmental impacts.
      4.2.1.3. Natural disasters affecting installation operations.
      4.2.1.4. Legislative changes impacting training capability.
      4.2.1.5. (Added-USAFESUP) USAFE Installation METS will be updated on a
      quarterly basis between the 1st to the 5th of the month, within 72 hours of a significant
      change, or as directed per HoW timelines.
   4.2.2. Don't assess tasks an installation does not perform. In these cases, the installation’s
   designated agent (see paragraph 4.2.3) will coordinate with the MAJCOM readiness office
   for approval to delete the non-applicable task. Once approval is received, the installation will
   invalidate the non-applicable task via Build METL.
   4.2.3. Wing commanders will name the Mission Support Group commander, Civil Engineer
   Squadron commander, or the organization that supports the installation and facilities as the
   designated agent to assess the installation mission for the UIC/installation (unit) registered in
   DRRS. Commanders will assess the ability of the installation to accomplish assigned tasks
   to standard(s) under specified conditions as documented in the AFUTL. The AFUTL can be

   accessed       on     SIPR     (http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/sites/afog/operational_readiness/
   default.aspx). These assessments should be informed by performance measures, resource
   availability (i.e., SORTS), and military experience/judgment.
       4.2.3.1. (Added-USAFESUP) The wing commander will appoint, in writing, a
       designated agent to assess the installation mission for the UIC/installation (unit)
       registered in DRRS, using Figure A4.1 as an example. The appointment letter must
       contain the name, Date Eligible for Return from Overseas (DEROS), unit/office symbol,
       telephone number, and e-mail address. Provide a copy of the signed letter to USAFE
       Readiness Measures. The Wing DRRS POC will update the appointment letter as
       changes occur.
   4.2.4. Installations with multiple MAJCOMs: Each MAJCOM will assess the capabilities
   they provide. The lead MAJCOM (i.e., base host) will make an overall assessment for the
   base.
   4.2.5. For Joint Bases, AF wings/groups that are not the lead Service will only assess the
   capabilities they provide. Joint Bases that are hosted by the AF will be assessed by the agent
   as appointed by the Wing Commander (see paragraph 4.2.3.)
4.3. METL Development. See the AFUTL for additional information about MET/METL
development. The AFUTL can be accessed on SIPR (http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/sites/afog/
operational_readiness/default.aspx).    Once on this SIPR website, click on ‘Readiness
Publications,’ and then you can access the AFUTL. Attachment 3 of this AFI lists the POCs for
the Core METL. POCs are assigned by AF/A3O-IR and are generally the FAM from the
MAJCOM designated as the lead command or the appropriate HAF FAM. For multifunctional
units (i.e., OSS, LRS, etc.), the FAM for the functional area with the preponderance of the unit
mission (to include equipment) will serve as the OPR. The other FAMs for multifunctional units
will serve as OCRs.
   4.3.1. (Added-USAFESUP) FAMs will review their functional DOC Statements and
   mission narratives to help identify mission requirements, tasking’s and assigned capabilities.

Terms
Air Force Universal Task List (AFUTL)— The AFUTL incorporates AF unique tasks. The
AFUTL expands on the Universal Joint Task List (UJTL) to show hierarchy, and mirrors the
taxonomy of the UJTL. The AFUTL and UJTL are the resources from which to select tasks to
build a unit’s METL. The AFUTL is incorporated into the DRRS on the ESORTS page and is
accessible when adding a task to a unit’s METL. It further correlates, aligns and maps to the
Universal Joint Task List and replaces the obsolete 1998 AFDD 1-1, Air Force Task List.
 38                                              AFI10-252_USAFESUP_I 15 AUGUST 2013


Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) UTC Status Reporting Tool (ART)— Enables
commanders to report the ability of a standard UTC to perform its mission anywhere in the world
at the time of the assessment and identify capability through the next AEF pair. It highlights
missing resources and helps quantify missing requirements for additional justification when
submitting budgets. It also provides the ability to evaluate a UTC prior to tasking and picks the
UTC with the best capability to meet the tasking. ART is the only assessment system that goes
down to the UTC level. It does not measure a UTC’s availability to deploy, only its ability to
meet its mission.
Combat Support Agency— A DoD agency so designated by Congress or the Secretary of
Defense that supports military combat operations.
Commander’s Assessment— Unit commander’s evaluation of data (obtained through
DRRS/ESORTS measurement and/or information available to the commander outside the
measurement system) and judgment as to which assessment rating best represents the actual
readiness of commander’s unit.
Current Unit Status Tool (CUS)— Allows AF users to review unit resources and assess METs
/ METLs.
Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segment (DCAPES)— The AF
standard automated data processing subsystem of the Joint Operation Planning and Execution
System (JOPES), which is used by operations, logistics, and force support planners at all
command levels, to develop and maintain force packages and task requirements for operation
plan Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data.
Department of Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS)— The means to monitor the
readiness of the DoD Components to provide capabilities to support the NMS as specified in the
defense and contingency planning guidance, Theater Security Cooperation Guidance, and the
Unified Command Plan.
Enhanced Status of Resources and Training System (ESORTS)— The capability-based
readiness reporting system that provides current readiness status for operational forces and
defense support organizations in terms of their ability to perform their tasks and missions.
Functional Area Manager (FAM)— The FAM is the individual responsible for the
management and planning of all personnel and equipment within a specific functional area to
support wartime and peacetime contingencies.
Guest— A DRRS user role that has read-only access to ESORTS information. There are no
assessment or build METL editing privileges associated with this user role. It is a role the
software temporarily assigns when viewing a unit's METL where there is no account set up. The
DRRS Support Center normally assigns "no role" when a DRRS account is first approved. The
UA then has to assign the correct role for the UU. Also known as “viewer.”
Joint Force Readiness Review (JFRR)— The principal assessment of the Chairman's
Readiness System. Combines and analyzes unit and joint C/S/A readiness assessments, pulled
from DRRS and SORTS, to capture DoD's strategic readiness to execute the NMS. The JFRR
assists the Chairman in providing the best military advice to the President and SecDef by
informing the Chairman's Risk Assessment, Annual Report on Combatant Commander
Requirements, Capability Gap Assessment, and Quarterly Readiness Report to Congress.
AFI10-252_USAFESUP_I 15 AUGUST 2013                                                               39


Addresses three primary topics; these may be supplemented by additional data and analysis as
best supports the Chairman and senior leadership: a. Overall Department Readiness Assessment.
The Department's overall ability to execute the NMS. b. C/S/A Readiness Data. Resource and
capability readiness assessments against J/AMETs/JCAs and assigned missions. c. Readiness
Metrics and Analysis. Service oriented Health of the Force metrics, force availability for
contingency operations. Submitted quarterly to the DJS via JSAP, provided to Chairman's Risk
Assessment, Annual Report on Combatant Commander Requirements, Capability Gap
Assessment, and Quarterly Readiness Report to Congress process leaders and posted in DRRS
and on designated SIPRNET web sites after approval.
Measured Units (Reporting Units)— Measured units are all planned and actual Joint Task Force
HQs, NAFs, combat, combat support, combat services support units including Active, Air National
Guard, AF Reserve and provisional units apportioned to or deployed in support of a CJCS or
combatant command-directed OPLAN, Concept Plans, OPLAN 8010, or Volume 3 of the AF WMP-
3, or assigned in the Forces For Unified Commands document, Global Force Management Allocation
Plan. At a minimum, AF units that report SORTS will assess a DRRS METL.
Mission Essential Task (MET)— A task based on mission analysis and approved by the
commander that is absolutely necessary, indispensable, or critical to the success of a mission.
Mission Essential Task List (METL)— A list of METs required to accomplish an assigned or
anticipated mission that includes associated tasks, conditions, and standards, and requires the
identification of command-linked and supporting tasks.
Operational Control (OPCON)— Command authority that may be exercised by commanders
at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is inherent in
combatant command (command authority) and may be delegated within the command.
Operational control is the authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate
forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating
objectives, and giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational
control includes authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training
necessary to accomplish missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be
exercised through the commanders of subordinate organizations. Normally this authority is
exercised through subordinate joint force commanders and Service and/or functional component
commanders. Operational control normally provides full authority to organize commands and
forces and to employ those forces as the commander in operational control considers necessary
to accomplish assigned missions; it does not, in and of itself, include authoritative direction for
logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training.
Operation Plan (OPLAN)— A plan for a single or series of connected operations to be carried
out simultaneously or in succession. It is usually based upon stated assumptions and is in the
form of directive employed by higher authority to permit subordinate commanders to prepare
supporting plans and orders. The designation “plan” is usually used instead of “order” in
preparing for operations well in advance. An operation plan may be put into effect at a
prescribed time, or on signal, and then becomes an operation order. Plans are prepared by
Combatant Commanders in response to requirements established by the Chairman, Joint Chiefs
of Staff and by commanders of subordinate commands in response to requirements tasked by the
establishing unified commander. OPLANs are prepared in either complete format of an OPLAN,
or as a CONPLAN. OPLAN is an operation plan for the conduct of joint operations that can be
 40                                               AFI10-252_USAFESUP_I 15 AUGUST 2013


used as a basis for developing an OPORD. An OPLAN identifies the forces and supplies
required to execute the combatant commander’s Strategic Concept and a movement schedule of
these resources to the theater of operations. The forces and supplies are identified in TPFDD
files. OPLANs will include all phases of the tasked operation. The plan is prepared with the
appropriate annexes, appendices, and TPFDD files as described in the JOPES manuals
containing planning policies, procedures, and formats. A CONPLAN is an operation plan in an
abbreviated format that would require considerable expansion or alteration to convert it into an
OPLAN or OPORD. A CONPLAN contains the combatant commander’s strategic concept and
those annexes and appendices deemed necessary by the combatant commander to complete
planning. Generally, detailed support requirements are not calculated and TPFDD files are not
prepared.
Readiness (Department of Defense)— A measure of the Department of Defense's ability to
provide the capabilities needed to execute the missions specified in the National Military Strategy.
Unit Administrator (UA)— DRRS user role that has privileges to customize unit information and
manage offices, add, build and assess METs, manage unit user accounts, and save assessment snap
shots for their unit(s) of assignment. At HHQ (Group/Wing/NAF/MAJCOM), will supervise/manage
subordinate units' DRRS implementation and monthly mission readiness assessments.
Unit Commander (UC)— DRRS user role that has privileges to approve overall mission
assessments for their unit of assignment. This role also permits unit information customization,
MET adding, building, and assessment, and office management.
Unit Identification Code (UIC)— A six-character, alpha-numeric code that uniquely identifies
each Active, Reserve, and National Guard unit of the Armed Forces (CJCSM 3150.02,Global
Status of Resources and Training System (GSORTS)).
Unit Type Code (UTC)— A five-character, alpha-numeric code that uniquely identifies each
type of unit in the Armed Forces (CJCSM 3150.02B, Global Status of Resources and Training
System (GSORTS)). A UTC is a potential capability focused upon accomplishment of a specific
mission that the military Service provides.
Unit User (UU)— DRRS user role that can view/edit ESORTS information. A UU has
privileges to assess the specific tasks assigned by their Office of Primary Responsibility.
Universal Joint Task List (UJTL)— Identifies what is to be performed in terms common to the
Joint Staff, Services, combatant commands and components, activities, joint organizations, and
agencies responsive to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and is a menu of tasks in a
common language, which serves as the foundation for capabilities-based planning across the
range of military operations.
War and Mobilization Plan (WMP)— The AF supporting plan to the Joint Strategic
Capabilities Plan. The five volumes of the WMP extend through the FYDP to provide continuity
in short and mid-range war and mobilization planning. It provides current planning cycle policies
and planning factors for the conduct and support of wartime operations. It establishes
requirements for development of mobilization and production-planning programs to support
sustained contingency operations of the programmed forces. The WMP encompasses all
functions necessary to match facilities, manpower, and material with planned wartime activity
(AFDD 1-2, Air Force Glossary).

   Manager overall effectiveness.
   A5.1.2. (USAFESUP) SAVs will be scheduled and conducted by request and when funded
   by the wing. USAFE/A3RR must receive an invitation by the wing commander and each
   SAV will be coordinated through the wing and USAFE Gatekeepers.
   A5.1.3. (USAFESUP) The most current Unit Compliance Inspection (UCI)/Unit
   Effectiveness Inspection (UEI) report will be used as the basis of measurement for all DRRS
   programs. The most current UCI DRRS checklists can be downloaded from MICT.
   A5.1.4. (USAFESUP) The SAV will be conducted in conjunction with Wing DRRS
   Manager training, as required.

                     as "Y" and the remaining supporting tasks are assessed as "Q"; then the
                     MET assessment should be "Y."

             _____(2) “Qualified Yes” (Q/Yellow): If the majority of the MET supporting tasks
                     are assessed as "Q" and the remaining supporting tasks are assessed as "Y";
                     then the MET assessment should be "Q."

             _____(3) “No” (N/Red): If any of the MET supporting tasks are assessed as “No,”
                      then the commander must make a judgment as to whether the mission
                      objectives can still be accomplished. If the commander makes a subjective
                      upgrade for an overall mission assessment to anything other than “No” the
