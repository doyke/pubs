                                           Chapter 1

                                            POLICY

1.1. Overview. This instruction provides for training management of CAA personnel in both
additional and supplemental aircraft. This instruction establishes a standardized training
program to qualify crew members in additional aircraft and implements AFI 11-202, Vol 1. This
instruction also establishes criteria for training and certification on supplemental aircraft.
   1.1.1. Additional and Supplemental aircraft are two separate categories of aircraft operated
   by AFSOC CAAs.
       1.1.1.1. Additional Aircraft. AFSOC owned or leased aircraft not part of the enduring
       United States Air Force (USAF) inventory but maintained and flown for the purposes of
       CAA aircrew qualification and/or certification. The training instructions for these aircraft
       are listed in this instruction, supplemented as required by applicable addenda. Aircrew
       members receive evaluations as prescribed in AFI 11-202, Vol 2, Aircrew
       Standardization/Evaluation Program and AFSOCI 11-219, Vol 2, Additional Aircraft
       Aircrew Evaluation Criteria, leading to an AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew
       Qualification. The training instructions for these aircraft are in Chapters 2–6.
       1.1.1.2. Supplemental Aircraft. Aircraft which are not typically owned or leased by the
       USAF, and typically used for less than 6 months for the purpose of aviation advisory
       operations and training. The training instructions for these aircraft are listed in this
       instruction, Chapter 7.
   1.1.2. Training policy, guidance, and requirements are set forth for each phase of aircrew
   training. The phases are designed to progressively develop the readiness of each aircrew
   member while maintaining previously acquired proficiency.
       1.1.2.1. Qualification Training (Chapter 2) qualifies aircrew members for basic non-
       tactical aircrew duties on additional aircraft.
       1.1.2.2. Mission Qualification Training (Chapter 3) qualifies aircrew members for
       tactical aircrew duties on additional aircraft.
       1.1.2.3. Continuation Training (Chapter 4) provides the capability for aircrew members
       to reinforce and build upon previous training and conduct continuation aircrew training
       designed to enhance aircrew readiness on additional aircraft.
       1.1.2.4. Upgrade/Specialized Training (Chapter 5) upgrades aircrew to aircraft
       commander and instructor on additional aircraft. It also qualifies selected aircrew
       members in specialized mission operations.
       1.1.2.5. Grade folder completion instructions are contained in Chapter 6.
       1.1.2.6. All training and certification issues on supplemental aircraft are contained in
       Chapter 7, to include aircraft qualification, mission qualification, continuation training,
       and upgrade/specialized training.
 6                                                     AFSOCI11-219V1 20 NOVEMBER 2013


1.2. Training Objective. The overall objective of the aircrew training program is to develop
and maintain a high state of aircrew readiness to facilitate immediate and effective employment
in CAA missions, exercises, contingencies, limited war, and general war operations.
1.3. Roles and Responsibilities.
     1.3.1. Headquarters (HQ) AFSOC in coordination with HQ United States Special Operations
     Command (USSOCOM) will establish and supervise an aircrew training program consistent
     with the policies and requirements of this instruction.
     1.3.2. Commanders at each level will comply with the policies and intent of this instruction,
     ensure that safety is not compromised, and monitor aircrew training to ensure these programs
     are both aggressively and realistically designed and executed.
     1.3.3. Supervisors will identify areas where additional training is needed and direct squadron
     training accordingly. They will initiate action to obtain necessary training support from the
     appropriate office or headquarters as soon as the need for assistance becomes apparent.
     Supervisors will ensure mission objectives are pre-briefed, debriefed, and evaluated to ensure
     successful mission accomplishment. They will also initiate waiver requests of training
     requirements through appropriate channels when facilities and support are not available.
1.4. Aircrew Training Policy.
     1.4.1. CAA assigned/attached personnel will be qualified and current in additional aircraft in
     which they function as primary aircrew members. To obtain initial qualification in additional
     aircraft, aircrew members will attend qualification training courses according to the
     following protocol:
        1.4.1.1. If a Department of Defense (DOD) qualification course is available, CAA
        aircrew will make every effort to attend the DOD course. Training will be accomplished
        in accordance with that agency’s training syllabus. An AF Form 8, evaluation will be
        required. Secondary method waivers can be requested through training channels to HQ
        AFSOC/A3T (AFRC waivers will be requested through training channels to HQ
        AFRC/A3T). (T-2)
        1.4.1.2. If a DOD course is not available or not practical, CAA aircrew will gain
        qualification in accordance with unit developed training programs, or by secondary
        method using DOD courseware (HQ AFSOC/A3T approval required). These unit
        developed training products will be approved by HQ AFSOC/A3T and as a minimum
        will include a Syllabus of Instruction (SOI) and an AF Form 4111, SOF/CSAR Training
        Record. (T-2)
            1.4.1.2.1. A portion of the ground training and flight training may be facilitated by
            civilian agencies, including foreign sources, contracted by the unit. An AF Form 8,
            evaluation by a USAF evaluator qualified in the additional aircraft will be required
            for completion of qualification/mission qualification training.
            1.4.1.2.2. Foreign Government/Partner Nation (PN). Training materials approved by
            HQ AFSOC/A3T will be used when obtaining qualification training with foreign
            organizations.
     1.4.2. Initial Cadre. In the case of a new additional aircraft or mission set, where there is no
     established cadre of unit instructors and evaluators, the unit commander shall designate an
AFSOCI11-219V1 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                7


   initial cadre of aircrew.     Refer to AFI 11-202, Vol 2 AFSOC Sup, Aircrew
   Standardization/Evaluation Program, for initial cadre guidance. (T-2)
       1.4.2.1. If the unit intends to train additional aircrew outside the initial cadre, HQ
       AFSOC/A3T must approve and publish a formal SOI. Additional procedures for training
       on the aircraft, if required, will be written as an addendum to this instruction. (T-2)
       1.4.2.2. If the unit intends to operate the additional aircraft for a period exceeding 6
       months, aircraft specific operational procedures will be written as an addendum or
       supplement to AFSOCI 11-219, Vol 3, Additional/Supplemental Aircraft Operations
       Procedures. For periods of less than 6 months, an HQ AFSOC/A3 approved Guidance
       Memorandum may be used.
   1.4.3. The unit operations officer is responsible for providing an adequate continuation
   training and currency plan for all crew members flying additional aircraft. See Chapter 4 for
   minimum required continuation training and currency events.
   1.4.4. The number of training tasks in the initial qualification, tactical qualification, or
   upgrade training guide is a recommended average which normally allows the student to
   achieve the desired level of proficiency. It is not intended to restrict the number of times a
   task may be accomplished.
   1.4.5. Individual events accomplished during satisfactory completion of initial, mission, and
   upgrade evaluations may be credited towards the individual's currency requirements.
   1.4.6. Proficiency advancement is acceptable with a recommendation from the trainee’s
   instructor and concurrence of the unit operations officer for all upgrades.      The
   recommendation and concurrence must be documented in the individual’s training record
   prior to the flight evaluation.
1.5. Training Records. The AF Form 4109, SOF/CSAR Aircrew Training Record, is the
method of documentation. HQ AFSOC/A3T, in conjunction with unit training, will develop
AF Forms 4111 for all long-term lease aircraft. Long-term lease for the purpose of this
instruction is more than six months. Training records from an outside source may be used if
approved by HQ AFSOC/A3T. Document training IAW this paragraph and Chapter 6.
   1.5.1. When an aircrew member receives training in an additional aircraft from sources
   outside the unit, the individual must provide documentation to squadron training. This
   documentation should include copies of logbook entries, endorsements, other certificates of
   training, and/or airmen certificates. This documentation will be maintained in Tab 2 of an
   aircrew member’s flight evaluation folder (FEF). Annotate civilian certifications and
   endorsements on AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications, IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2
   AFSOC Sup.
   1.5.2. Additional aircraft training documentation will be routed through unit training then to
   unit standardization/evaluation. Unit training will also retain a copy of all documentation in
   the member’s career training folder.
1.6. Sole Aircraft Qualification. Additional aircraft may be designated as the sole aircraft for
pilots provided the aircraft is a suitable instrument platform (i.e., able to be used for an
instrument flight evaluation). Other crew members may be assigned additional aircraft as their
sole aircraft at the discretion of the unit operations officer.

1.7. Multiple Aircraft Qualification. HQ AFSOC/A3V must approve, in writing, all aircrew
to be qualified on multiple aircraft, IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1, and AFI 11-401. AFRC units will
route multiple qualification requests to HQ AFRC/A3T and A3V. (T-2)
     1.7.1. Unit pilots will not maintain qualification in more than two aircraft. Unit non-pilot
     aircrew will not maintain qualification in more than three aircraft. Evaluator aircrew may be
     authorized one additional aircraft qualification.
     1.7.2. Aircrew members will not enter into training on additional aircraft until multi-
     qualification status is approved.
     1.7.3. If an aircrew member enters into training on a new additional aircraft and will exceed
     his total number of authorized multiple qualifications, the unit will rescind qualification on
     one of the current aircraft via a commander directed downgrade (not for cause).
     1.7.4. Certification on supplemental aircraft is not the same as qualification, and does not
     count against the number of aircraft qualifications.
1.8. Waivers. Training only be reduced or waived by HQ AFSOC/A3T, unless specifically
delegated by this instruction.     Submit waiver requests through A3T channels to
HQ AFSOC/A3T. (T-2)

   1.12.2. Miscellaneous upgrades, which only qualify a crew member in specific mission
   profiles, (i.e., Night Vision Goggle (NVG) Landing, Hot Refueling, etc.) are not considered
   ADSC incurring events.
   1.12.3. If an ADSC is required, unit training officers will coordinate with the servicing
   Military Personnel Flight (MPF) to ensure the individual acknowledges the ADSC to be
   incurred by signing the AF Form 63, Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC)
   Acknowledgement Statement. This action will occur prior to the individual entering training.
   Upon course completion, the unit-training officer will notify the MPF the individual has
   completed training and the MPF will update the ADSC in the Military Personnel Data
   System (MilPDS). Note: Due to the extended nature of some in-unit upgrades, ADSCs will
   be effective upon completion of the training or 120 days after the first flying event,
   whichever occurs first.

                                          Chapter 4

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. Overview. Requirements in this chapter satisfy the minimum ground and flying training
requirements established by HQ USAF and HQ AFSOC to maintain currency. Individual
proficiency may require a greater number of events. Commanders will ensure aircrew members
receive sufficient continuation training to maintain individual proficiency. All flying training
events are derived from AFSOC mission requirements that correspond to associated items on the
AFSOC Mission Essential Task List (METL) and unit METL.
   4.1.1. In planning and scheduling training missions, instructors will develop realistic
   scenarios to maximize training benefits on each mission.
   4.1.2. Training requirements may be completed on any sortie if the accrediting criteria of
   this instruction are met. When more than one event is required, commanders must ensure
   that flying training requirements are spread as evenly as possible throughout the training
   period.
   4.1.3. Aircrew members will not log continuation training requirements in events in which
   they are unqualified.
   4.1.4. Semiannual/quarterly training events accomplished on a satisfactory qualification,
   mission qualification, special mission, or requalification evaluation may be credited toward
   the individual's semiannual/quarterly currency/volume requirements.
   4.1.5. For special qualifications requiring instructor certification, the event resulting in
   certification and each event thereafter may be credited towards currency/volume
   requirements.
4.2. Aircrew Status. This chapter outlines the continuation training program, providing aircrew
members with the volume, frequency, and mix of training to maintain proficiency in the unit’s
mission. Aircrew members assigned or attached to the unit are assigned to Mission Ready (MR),
Mission Capable (MC), and Basic Aircraft Qualified (BAQ) status.
   4.2.1. MR Status. A MR aircrew member is defined as one who is available, qualified, and
   certified in the unit mission IAW the DOC statement and who can meet the requirements of
   the appropriate METLs, operational tasking, and deployments. Must maintain all of the
   appropriate flying and ground training requirements listed in this chapter.
   4.2.2. MC Status. A MC aircrew member has completed mission qualification training, does
   not maintain MR status, but maintains familiarization in the unit’s mission. The aircrew
   member may maintain qualification in some aspects of the unit mission and is able to attain
   full MR status within 30 days. MC aircrew members will maintain at least 50% of their
   appropriate flying training level requirements.
   4.2.3. BAQ Status. An aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed training and is
   qualified to perform basic non-tactical aircrew duties in the unit aircraft.
4.3. Training Level. Before each semiannual period, the squadron commander or designated
representative determines the training level of each assigned or attached aircrew member, and
will ensure that individuals receive training to successfully perform unit missions and maintain
AFSOCI11-219V1 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                 15


individual proficiency. Established training levels do not preclude the unit commander from
scheduling an individual for additional training or assigning an individual to a more restrictive
training level.
   4.3.1. Ground Training Level (GTL).
       4.3.1.1. GTL 1. Aircrew members with five or more years of Air Force operational
       flying.
       4.3.1.2. GTL 2. Aircrew members with less than five years of Air Force operational
       flying.
       4.3.1.3. Multiple aircraft qualified aircrew will follow applicable Mission Design Series
       (MDS) instructions for GTL guidance.
   4.3.2. Flying Training Level (FTL). All CAA aircrew operating additional aircraft are
   assigned to FTL A, for ARMS tracking purposes. For continuation training requirements,
   aircrew will comply with the applicable requirements of Table 4.1, as well as any
   requirements established in aircraft specific addenda. Note this FTL is not the same as those
   identified in specific MDS instructions. Aircrew who are multiple aircraft qualified must
   only accomplish 50% of the listed continuation training volume on the additional aircraft.
   AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 1, training requirements always apply to aircrew qualified on standard
   inventory aircraft.
   4.3.3. Prorating Training Requirements.
       4.3.3.1. Prorate aircrew member flying training requirements for individuals not
       available for flying duties due to Permanent Change of Station (PCS), nonflying
       Temporary Duty (TDY), Duties Not Including Flying (DNIF), emergency leave, etc., and
       aircraft nonavailability. Prorate individual requirements based on the number of full
       calendar months left in the training period following completion of basic qualification,
       mission qualification, requalification, and upgrades to a new special mission
       qualification.
       4.3.3.2. After a PCS, stop prorating requirements when the individual receives their PCS
       station medical clearance from the Flight Surgeon (AF Form 1042, Medical
       Recommendation for Flying or Special Operational Duty).
4.4. Ground Training Requirements.
   4.4.1. Recurring Ground Training Requirements. Unit ARMS will create unit-level training
   events for each recurring ground training event in each additional aircraft in order to track
   currency.
       4.4.1.1. Egress training. Actual hands-on training will be accomplished in the additional
       aircraft to include opening all exits at least every 17 months. Loadmasters and flight
       engineers may credit this event when they accomplish an aircraft preflight. Egress
       training is a grounding event. Crew members will not fly until current in this item.
       4.4.1.2. Aircrew will accomplish AFE training on equipment carried onboard the aircraft
       at least every 17 months. The unit operations officer, along with unit aircrew flight
       equipment specialists, will determine the suitability of training to meet this requirement.
       Crew members will be restricted to local training missions only until current in this event.
 16                                                   AFSOCI11-219V1 20 NOVEMBER 2013


       4.4.1.3. Aircrew will accomplish a formal aircraft systems review every 17 months (12
       months GTL 2). This review should be done IAW the aircraft specific addendum to this
       instruction, and may be accomplished in conjunction with simulator training. In the
       absence of any aircraft specific guidance, the unit operations officer will determine a
       suitable substitute.
       4.4.1.4. Aircrew members who maintain instrument qualification solely on an additional
       aircraft will take the Instrument Refresher Course (IRC) at the end of every fourth quarter
       following completion.        This does not supersede instrument procedures testing
       requirements set forth in AFI 11-202, Vol 2, and AFSOCI 11-219, Vol 2.
   4.4.2. Crew members overdue a grounding item in additional aircraft (including those
   identified in an aircraft specific addendum to this instruction) will not be scheduled for any
   flight duties on that aircraft. Crew members overdue any mission ready or training status
   item will not be scheduled for aircrew standby duties in their additional aircraft until they
   have satisfied all delinquent items.
4.5. Flying Training Requirements. Minimum annual training volume for aircrew is listed in
Table 4.1. When an aircrew member is multiple aircraft qualified, they are only required to
accomplish 50% of the Table 4.12 training volume, per aircraft. Additional training events may
be listed in aircraft specific addenda to this instruction and are not subject to the 50% reduction.
BAQ only aircrew (to include aircrew pursuing mission upgrade) are not required to accomplish
mission events. Unit operations officers should tailor the mission events required to the
capabilities of the aircraft and mission. Clarification on definitions of some flying events
follows:
   4.5.1. Event Definitions.
       4.5.1.1. Aircrew Proficiency Sortie. Pilots may credit an aircrew proficiency sortie if
       they perform a takeoff, approach and landing from either pilot seat. Navigators may log
       an aircrew proficiency sortie when they monitor a departure and approach. Loadmasters
       may credit an aircrew proficiency sortie if they perform the duties that are applicable to
       the loadmaster’s crew position, complete all station functions, and complete all checklists
       during takeoff and landing. Other aircrew members may credit an aircrew proficiency
       sortie when they perform appropriate preflight, in-flight and post flight duties in their
       primary crew position. A proficiency sortie will be logged every 60 days in each aircraft
       in which currency is maintained.
       4.5.1.2. Local Proficiency Sortie (LPS). A LPS training mission including at least 30
       minutes of primary (or instructor time) practicing instrument, transition and emergency
       procedures. Fly maneuvers under the supervision of an instructor pilot and repeat them
       until an acceptable level of proficiency is attained or the LPS may not be credited. If the
       LPS is incomplete, the instructor will recommend whether the entire LPS or just the
       incomplete events must be re-accomplished. Instructors and flight examiners in the
       specific additional aircraft need not complete all LPS events on a single sortie. Credit a
       LPS when all events are complete. Unit commanders may add to the following minimum
       LPS sortie criteria for pilots:
           4.5.1.2.1. A review of boldface emergency procedures (if any).
           4.5.1.2.2. Two instrument approaches.
AFSOCI11-219V1 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                            17

        Manual, POH, FAA Approved Flight Manual or Aircraft Operations Manual.
     4.5.1.3. NVG Low-Level Sortie. A visual low-level operation (30 minutes minimum)
     accomplished using NVGs for terrain clearance, turn point identification, and Drop Zone
     (DZ)/Landing Zone (LZ) acquisition. An NVG low-level sortie will be flown every 90
     days in each aircraft in which currency is maintained.
     4.5.1.4. Mission Sortie. Log a tactical mission sortie after completing a minimum of a
     30 minute low-level sortie to a tactical event.
     4.5.1.5. Tail-Wheel Mission. Any tactical mission flown on an aircraft equipped with a
     tail-wheel. Only required for pilots qualified on tail-wheel aircraft, then subsequently
     required every 60 days.
     4.5.1.6. NVG Takeoff/Landing. Any configuration or type of takeoff or landing
     conducted while wearing NVGs between sunset and sunrise. Crew members may credit
     NVG touch-and-go landings as a NVG takeoff and NVG landing.
     4.5.1.7. Airdrop Operations. Log an airdrop event when a successful airdrop is
     accomplished. Credit all airdrops that land within 300 meters of the aim point as
     successful. An off drop zone drop or malfunction is not a successful drop. Pilots may
     credit airdrops when performing pilot or copilot duties (including Computed Air Release
     Point (CARP)/High-Altitude Release Point (HARP) computations if applicable).
     Navigators must compute a CARP or HARP to credit an airdrop. Do not credit off DZ
     airdrops.
        4.5.1.7.1. Total Airdrop. The airdrop may consist of a Standard Airdrop Training
        Bundle (SATB) or actual load, using any approved airdrop method.
        4.5.1.7.2. Equipment. Pilots log this event when an actual or SATB equipment drop
        is accomplished. Loadmasters and navigators log this event when an actual
        equipment load is dropped.
        4.5.1.7.3. Container Delivery System (CDS). Pilots log this event when an actual or
        SATB CDS drop is accomplished. Loadmasters and navigators log this event when
        an actual CDS bundle is dropped. Only required on aircraft capable of CDS airdrop.
        4.5.1.7.4. Personnel. Pilots, navigators and loadmasters log this event when an actual
        personnel drop is accomplished (free fall or static line).

Notes:
1. For aircraft equipped with the proper equipment or instrumentation and applicable
documentation exists to execute the event.
2. Pilots must accomplish a takeoff, approach (if the aircraft is a suitable instrument platform) and
landing every 60 days in each additional aircraft in which currency is maintained. All other
aircrew members must accomplish at least one aircrew proficiency sortie every 60 days in each
additional aircraft in which currency is maintained. Failure to do them results in loss of aircraft
currency.
3. Aircrew will accomplish a minimum of two aircraft proficiency sorties and two mission sorties
within 60 days of departing on an advisory mission where that aircraft will be operated. The
mission sortie should include profiles concentrating on the mission events that will be flown (i.e.,
 20                                                  AFSOCI11-219V1 20 NOVEMBER 2013


if NVGs will be flown on the advisory mission, both missions will be on NVGs).
4. Navigator and loadmaster must accomplish an actual drop to satisfy this requirement.
5. Tail Wheel landings can only be logged if conducted to a full stop or stop-and-go.
6. Pilots must accomplish at least one NVG short field takeoff and landing every 90 days, for
NVG Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) mission aircraft.
7. Pilots must accomplish at least one normal field NVG Takeoff and Landing every 60 days.
Pilots and Navigators must accomplish one NVG Low-Level Sortie every 90 days.

4.6. Recurrency and Requalification Training. IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1.
4.7. Use of the Aviation Resource Management System. All units will use ARMS and
develop local procedures to ensure aircrew ground and flying training is properly documented
and updated. Each unit will provide a printed copy of current ground and flying training
summaries to each individual prior to PCS.
4.8. Instructor/Flight Examiner Training Requirements. Instructors and flight examiners
will comply with Table 4.1 for semiannual flying requirements. Instructor pilots may credit
events accomplished in either seat. Instructors may credit up to 50% of their semiannual training
requirements from events conducted by students under their direct supervision. Flight examiners
are not authorized to log events flown by their evaluatees.

                                            Chapter 5

                           UPGRADE/SPECIALIZED TRAINING

5.1. Overview. This chapter identifies the prerequisites and training requirements for qualified
aircrew members upgrading to additional levels of qualification on additional aircraft.
5.2. Time Period to Qualification. Aircrew members will complete upgrade training within
4 months of start. Individuals unable to complete upgrade training within these limits may
continue training with operations officer approval. The operations officer will make an entry in
the individuals training record to document the circumstances for the extension and expected
qualification date.
5.3. Upgrade Documentation. The squadron will complete upgrade training through
HQ AFSOC/A3T approved qualification and mission qualification upgrade training. An
AF Form 4110, Comments – SOF/CSAR Training Record, and an AF Form 4111, will be
required for all additional aircraft upgrade training conducted by squadron instructors. (T-2)
5.4. Aircrew Instructor Program. A sound and practical aircrew instructor program is a
prerequisite for effective training, standardization, and aircraft accident prevention. The aircrew
instructor program includes individuals required to perform duties as an instructor for any
aircrew position. Instructors will be selected because of their background, extensive experience,
and ability to instruct.
   5.4.1. Flying Proficiency.     Individuals selected must be qualified and current in the
   additional aircraft.
   5.4.2. Flying Experience. Instructors must possess a reasonable background of flying
   experience to have developed desired standards of knowledge, judgment, and proficiency in
   both the aircraft and mission.
       5.4.2.1. Instructor Upgrade. Instructor candidates in additional aircraft must be
       previously instructor qualified in a USAF MDS (waiverable by HQ AFSOC/A3T).
       Qualification to instructor status will be IAW HQ AFSOC/A3T approved AF Form 4111
       and an AF Form 8 evaluation. For purposes of this instruction an instructor candidate
       must have a minimum of 1,000 hours total time and meet one of the following
       requirements: at least 100 hours as an instructor/evaluator in a USAF MDS with 50 hours
       of total time in the additional aircraft, or 100 total hours in the additional aircraft. (T-2)
   5.4.3. Instructor Responsibilities.
       5.4.3.1. Overview. Instructors are responsible for a thorough preflight briefing and
       critique. Instructors will review the student's training records prior to each training
       session. Instructors will ensure all required upgrade training items are completed and
       signed off and that proficiency has been demonstrated before recommending the student
       for an evaluation or certifying that the student is qualified for a mission. They should
       further ensure the training and operations sections are appraised of the student's progress
       and status.
       5.4.3.2. Instructor Pilots. Instructor pilots must be fully aware they are in command of
       training flights and are responsible for the conduct and safety of the aircraft. At any time
 22                                                    AFSOCI11-219V1 20 NOVEMBER 2013


       during the flight if the judgment or ability of the student at the controls to complete a
       maneuver is in doubt, the instructor should immediately take over the controls of the
       aircraft, and then explain and demonstrate the proper methods of conducting the
       maneuver. All instructors will place special emphasis on positively identifying the
       emergency condition prior to initiating corrective action.
       5.4.3.3. Instructor Aircrew Member (Other Than Pilot). It will be impressed upon every
       instructor that they are responsible for the safe execution of the duties at their position. If
       at any time during the flight, the judgment or proficiency of their student is in question,
       they will immediately take over those duties. The instructor should then explain and
       demonstrate the proper method of accomplishing those duties.
       5.4.3.4. Instructor Deficiencies. Instructors who reveal deficiencies in their ability to
       instruct may be used in a basic crew position (provided the deficiency does not involve
       basic crew duties). When the squadron commander determines that an instructor can no
       longer maintain status or proficiency for administrative reasons, the commander will take
       the necessary administrative action to return those individuals to their basic crew
       positions IAW USAF and AFSOC directives.
5.5. Flight Examiner. The SQ/CC (OG/CC for ARC units without squadron stan/eval function)
will certify the most highly qualified instructors as flight examiners. Conduct training IAW the
applicable AF Form 4111. Refer to AFI 11-202, Vol 2, applicable supplements and AFSOCI 11-
219, Vol 2, for additional guidance.
5.6. Safety Observer. Safety Observers (SO) may be required as part of the crew complement
when conduction NVG operations. SO training is stand-alone training for aircrew that are not
part of the normal crew complement. Conduct IAW AF Form 4111. Aircrew members who are
part of the normal crew complement will accomplish SO training as part of their crew position
tactical upgrade.

                             AIRCREW TRAINING RECORD

6.1. Overview. The primary purpose for maintaining training records is to accurately track and
control squadron members’ training, whether it is training in an aircraft for an aircrew member,
on a certain engine type for a maintenance member, or primary CAA mission qualification
training. Accurate documentation will ensure the member completes scheduled training in a
timely and efficient manner. For aircrew members, the AF Form 4109, will be used to track
training in Additional Aircraft except where other documentation is directed.
6.2. Aircrew Training Records. Aircrew training records are established and maintained in
accordance with AFI 11-401, and this instruction. Training (qualification, requalification,
specialized training, or upgrade of an aircrew member) will be documented in accordance with
AFI 11-202, Vol 1 AFSOC Supplement, Aircrew Training.

                                           Chapter 7

          SUPPLEMENTAL AIRCRAFT CERTIFICATION AND TRAINING

7.1. General Information.
   7.1.1. Overview. The purpose of this chapter is to outline the requirements for obtaining and
   maintaining certification on supplemental aircraft. These certifications are not the equivalent
   of AFI 11-202, Vol 2, aircraft qualifications, with the associated AF Form 8. For aircraft that
   require an AF Form 8, refer to either AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 1 (for USAF inventory MDS) or
   Chapters 2-4 of this instruction (for additional aircraft). This chapter also outlines the
   continuation training requirements on supplemental aircraft.
      7.1.1.1. Combat aviation aircrew advisors are required to assess, train, advise, and assist
      foreign nationals in the employment and operation of a variety of aircraft, in a tactical
      environment, and often on aircraft that are not in the USAF inventory. The CAA
      supplemental aircraft training program is designed to prepare experienced, mature tactical
      instructor aircrew to achieve and maintain the required level and type of expertise to
      operate successfully and safely in the aviation advisory environment.
      7.1.1.2. Supplemental aircraft are defined as aircraft which are not typically owned or
      leased by the USAF, and typically used for less than 6 months for the purpose of advisory
      operations preparation and execution.
          7.1.1.2.1. The critical threshold for establishing whether an aircraft is considered
          additional versus supplemental is the requirement for an AF Form 8. When operating
          (not as pilot-in-command (PIC)) an aircraft owned by a PN or any agency other than
          the USAF, AFSOC CAA aircrews typically do not require an AF Form 8. Operating
          any USAF-owned inventory aircraft normally requires an AF Form 8.
          7.1.1.2.2. For operations that require AFSOC CAAs to exercise PIC duties on
          otherwise supplemental aircraft (i.e., Security Assistance funded Military Training
          Team (MTT), Continental United States (CONUS) based PN training, etc.), the
          AFSOC/A3 shall determine, based on mission requirements, if a suitable alternate
          certification (i.e., other DOD certificate of qualification, FAA type rating) may be
          used in lieu of an AF Form 8. (T-2)
      7.1.1.3. In all cases, the overall intent of this chapter is to allow squadron commanders
      (or designated representative) to deploy highly qualified CAA aircrew to operate
      supplemental aircraft alongside PN forces. In areas not specifically discussed in this
      chapter, common sense shall apply and the squadron commander will make the final
      decision, balancing mission execution and flight safety.
   7.1.2. Purpose. AFSOC CAAs may require certification and training on supplemental
   aircraft in order to safely perform advisory duties with PN forces that do not operate aircraft
   similar to the USAF owned or leased inventory. Certification on a supplemental aircraft
   enables an AFSOC CAA to perform in-flight duties on a non-USAF aircraft, when
   authorized by the AFSOC/A3.
   7.1.3. Certification.   Training policy, guidance, and requirements are set forth in the
   following sections.      The sections specifically provide instruction regarding initial
AFSOCI11-219V1 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                 25


   certification in supplemental aircraft, mission certification, upgrade/specialized training, and
   continuation training requirements.
       7.1.3.1. Certification on a supplemental aircraft does not qualify aircrew members to
       operate similar MDS owned or leased by the USAF. For example, a CAA pilot obtains
       an FAA type rating on a civilian CASA 212 in preparation for deployment. He is not
       qualified to operate a USAF owned or leased CASA 212 without an AF Form 8.
       7.1.3.2. Successful completion of a certification course deemed acceptable by this
       instruction and the squadron commander will lead to the inclusion of the certification in
       the crew member’s FEF. Annotate on the crew members AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew
       Certifications, the initial certification (to include an equivalent qualification level),
       mission qualification, and any specialized or upgrade certification. Use a separate AF
       Form 4348 per aircraft type.
           7.1.3.2.1. Complete the AF Form 4348, IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2, except as follows:
           7.1.3.2.2. Instructor name will be the name (and any known level of qualification,
           i.e., FAA Check Airman) transcribed from the civilian documentation. If the name
           from the documentation is difficult to discern, enter the name of the squadron chief of
           standardization/evaluation and annotate in the remarks.
           7.1.3.2.3. The certifying official for civilian training certification/qualification
           transcriptions will be no less than the squadron operations officer.
           7.1.3.2.4. Under the Remarks block, enter the nature of the source documents used to
           transcribe the qualification event. Enter a restriction comment as follows:
           “CERTIFICATION DOES NOT APPLY TO USAF OWNED OR LEASED
           AIRCRAFT”.
7.2. Initial Certification.
   7.2.1. Overview. This section establishes minimum requirements for initial certification
   training in supplemental aircraft. The unit operations officer will determine which crew
   members will obtain training in specific supplemental aircraft. The unit commander will
   ensure aircrew members completing this training meet the qualification training
   requirements.
   7.2.2. General Requirements.     All crew members will comply with the physical,
   physiological, and administrative requirements for individuals performing flying duties
   specified in AFI 11202, Vol 1.
   7.2.3. Priority of Acceptable Training Sources. To obtain certification in supplemental
   aircraft, aircrew members should attend training courses according to the following protocol:
       7.2.3.1. If there is a USAF qualification course, aircrew should make every effort to
       attend and obtain an AF Form 8, via the AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 1 process. In the case in
       which the USAF course does not provide the appropriate skill set/capability required for
       the advisory mission, the unit commander should consider at least using the USAF course
       for basic qualification, with mission certification according to Paragraph 7.3. In the
       case where the USAF course is unavailable or impractical, the following methods of
       training may be used.
26                                                 AFSOCI11-219V1 20 NOVEMBER 2013


     7.2.3.2. If a non-USAF DOD qualification or certification course is available, aircrew
     members will make every effort to attend the DOD course. Training will be
     accomplished in accordance with that agency’s training syllabus.              Non-USAF
     qualification courses should result in the award of a service or department specific
     certificate of qualification, certification, training completion, or a similar version of
     documentation. It will be the final judgment of the unit commander of the acceptability
     of the furnished completion documents.
     7.2.3.3. If a DOD course is not available or practical, aircrew members will gain
     qualification from an accredited flight school, in accordance with Title 14, Code of
     Federal Regulations (CFR), otherwise known as the Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR).
        7.2.3.3.1. Contracted flight training for pilots will be accomplished in accordance
        with FAR Part 141 (Commercial Aviation) if available, or Part 61 (General Aviation).
        This training may result in a type rating, certificate of completion, specific log book
        endorsement, a letter of authorization, or as prescribed by FAR Part 141 or 61. It will
        be the final judgment of the unit commander of the acceptability of the furnished
        completion documents.
        7.2.3.3.2. If the aircraft does not have a FAA-type designation (a type designation is
        not necessarily a type rating), training will be in accordance with FAA Order
        8130.2G, Airworthiness Certification of Aircraft and Related Products. This training
        may result in a foreign type rating or license, certificate of completion, specific log
        book endorsement, a letter of authorization, or some other miscellaneous type of
        documentation. It will be the final judgment of the unit commander of the
        acceptability of the furnished completion documents, as long as the program was in
        compliance with the FAA Order.
     7.2.3.4. For aircrew member certifications where no adequate DOD or FAA guidance is
     provided, unit commander is responsible for determining a suitable training program.
     HQ AFSOC/A3T is the approval authority for this training program. (T-2)
     7.2.3.5. If DOD or FAR Part 141/61 formal training exists, but is not adequate or
     available in a timely manner to meet the requirements of the advisory mission, an
     alternate method, such as in-house training, may be used. Training will be conducted by
     an instructor crew member, current and certified in the designated aircraft. The instructor
     must either have over 100 hours in the type of aircraft and be either a qualified USAF
     instructor or be an FAA Certificated Flight Instructor (CFI) (or Multi-Engine Instructor
     (MEI), if required). The approval authority for alternate training methods remains with
     HQ AFSOC/A3T. Emphasis will be on providing aircrew members with a sound,
     credible training program that prepares the aircrew for the CAA mission. As a minimum,
     the training will include: (T-2)
        7.2.3.5.1. A familiarization of aircraft systems, aircraft performance, weight and
        balance, emergency procedures, and egress procedures.
        7.2.3.5.2. A familiarization of mission-specific or additional procedures for that
        aircraft, to include checklist procedures and aircraft loading (if available).
        7.2.3.5.3. Training standards, based on FAR Part 61, should be used when obtaining
        qualification or recurrency training with foreign organizations. If the aircraft does not
AFSOCI11-219V1 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                               27


        have an FAA-type designation, qualification will be in accordance with FAA Order
        8130.2G.
        7.2.3.5.4. Unit commander may direct use of foreign training standards if the foreign
        syllabus provides adequate training. HQ AFSOC/A3T is the approval authority for
        these standards. (T-2)
        7.2.3.5.5. There may be certain missions where a CAA crew member requires
        training and certification on a supplemental foreign aircraft after arrival to a forward
        deployed location. When, in the opinion of the mission commander, this mission
        necessity exists, the Theater Special Operation Command (TSOC) (or Joint Special
        Operations Task Force (JSOTF) if applicable) J3, with AFSOC/A3 concurrence, may
        authorize local training and certification. This approval may be initially obtained
        verbally, if necessary for mission expedition, with memorandum for record (MFR)
        documentation to follow. (T-1)
            7.2.3.5.5.1. A training plan should be submitted to HQ AFSOC/A3T as part of
            the AFSOC/A3 concurrence. The training plan should take into consideration the
            level of similarity between the intended supplemental aircraft and what aircraft
            the CAA is already qualified or certified to operate, as well as the experience
            level and proficiency of the intended instructor (i.e., fellow CAA teammate,
            civilian certified contractor, PN instructor pilot).
            7.2.3.5.5.2. Upon successful completion of the training, all certificates or
            documentation of completion will be faxed or scanned and sent home for
            inclusion in the crew member’s FEF and annotation on an AF Form 4348. The
            MFRs approving the downrange training will be kept in the member’s career
            training record.
            7.2.3.5.5.3. For emerging training requirements, not identified and approved prior
            to departure, the requirements of this paragraph do not alleviate the mission
            commander from normal chain-of-command approval requirements stemming
            from a change of Concept of Operations (CONOPS)/mission tasking.
     7.2.3.6. (Non-pilot aircrew) If training for non-pilot crew positions is not available or
     not addressed by the FAR for the designated aircraft, these members may be trained and
     certified by a squadron instructor who is certified in that aircraft, with over 50 hours in
     type.
     7.2.3.7. (Non-pilot aircrew) If a squadron instructor is not available, then the DOD or
     civilian agency providing the pilots’ training may certify non-pilot aircrew members.
     Training should include, at a minimum, the items addressed in Paragraphs 7.2.3.5.1 and
     7.2.3.5.2. The training agency must provide a detailed description of the instruction
     provided. It will be the final judgment of the unit commander to award specific mission
     event certification, based on the acceptability of the furnished completion report.
     7.2.3.8. (Non-pilot aircrew) In specific cases (such as loadmasters), where instructor
     aircrew members are operating similar systems/equipment in their standard aircraft,
     additional aircraft, or a different supplemental aircraft, HQ AFSOC/A3T may authorize
     differences and egress training in lieu of full initial certification training. In all cases
28                                                 AFSOCI11-219V1 20 NOVEMBER 2013


     these aircrew members will be afforded the opportunity to familiarize themselves with
     nonstandard but similar equipment. (T-2)
  7.2.4. Ground Training Requirements.
     7.2.4.1. Academic Ground Training. Ground training requirements will be established
     by the agency that provides the training. Academics should include a thorough review of
     the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) or POH. At a minimum, the academic program should
     review all critical aircraft systems (including operating limits), calculation of weight and
     balance and aircraft performance data, and all normal and emergency checklists.
     Particular attention should be paid to emergency procedures, and all BOLDFACE or
     civilian equivalent checklist steps must be committed to memory.
     7.2.4.2. Ground Egress. Aircrews will complete ground egress training during initial
     certification training. All crew members will receive training prior to their first flight.
     Actual hands-on training will be accomplished in the aircraft and will include opening
     each exit. This training will be conducted during ground training for each crew member.
     7.2.4.3. Aircrew Flight Equipment. Aircrews will complete classroom and hands-on
     training on all supplemental aircraft AFE prior to the first flight. This should include, as
     a minimum, familiarization with any ejection seats, aircraft carried parachutes, life rafts,
     life preservers, emergency oxygen systems, and firefighting equipment. The unit
     commander should consider use of unit AFE technicians to augment any contract flight
     school instruction on this equipment.
     7.2.4.4. Testing. Certain aircrew training programs may have testing requirements in
     order to successfully complete the course. CAAs are required to successfully pass all
     tests designated as part of the SOI. Failure of a test may result in the removal of training
     and denial of certification, at the discretion of the training program manager or the unit
     operations officer.
     7.2.4.5. FAA Certificate/Rating Testing. If required for mission enhancement or PN
     standards of certification, the unit operations officer may approve CAA pilots to take the
     tests required for the issuance of an Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) certificate, CFI rating,
     MEI rating, or specific aircraft type rating. CAAs who wish to use vendors offering
     commercial “study” programs for these tests are not authorized reimbursement. The
     FAA fee for taking the test may be included in the overall program cost, if in conjunction
     with a specific aircraft training program.
  7.2.5. Flying Training Requirements.
     7.2.5.1. Qualification Flight Training. The requirements for each aircrew position will
     typically be established by the agency that provides the training. For DOD courses, the
     service-approved SOI for qualification should be used when practical. For contract flight
     training, an SOI that meets the FAA stated requirements (either FAR Part 61 or 141)
     should be used.
     7.2.5.2. Minimum Flight Training Events. At a minimum, the initial qualification flight
     training on a supplemental aircraft should include:
         7.2.5.2.1. Normal ground procedures, to include engine starting/run-up, taxi, and
         preflight checks.
AFSOCI11-219V1 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                29


          7.2.5.2.2. Emergency ground procedures, to include emergency stopping of the
          aircraft after brake malfunction, ground aircraft fire procedures, and aircrew
          emergency egress.
          7.2.5.2.3. Aircraft handling during all phases of flight, to include stall recovery
          training and slow flight (if authorized by AFM/POH). For aircraft designated as
          acrobatic, training may include any AFM/POH authorized flight maneuvers
          anticipated to be utilized during the advisory operation. Acrobatic aircraft training
          should also include spin prevention and recovery procedures.
          7.2.5.2.4. Normal and aborted takeoff procedures, with associated memory items (if
          applicable). “V1/V2 cuts” (simulated engine shutdown at minimum control speed)
          may be included if required for the training syllabus.
          7.2.5.2.5. Normal cruise/in-flight checks and procedures, to include operation of the
          navigation system, pressurization system, weather radar, and communications
          devices.
          7.2.5.2.6. To the maximum extent possible, emergency in-flight procedures, to
          include demonstration of all BOLDFACE and memory items (if applicable).
          7.2.5.2.7. Normal descent and before landing procedures, with associated memory
          items (if applicable).
          7.2.5.2.8. Landing procedures, to include all normal and emergency aircraft flap/slat
          configurations.
          7.2.5.2.9. Balked landing/go-around procedures, in both normal and engine-out
          configurations; for single engine aircraft, simulated flame out pattern procedures (if
          authorized by AFM/POH).
          7.2.5.2.10. Any additional flight or ground aircraft maneuvers required by the
          specific program of instruction.
7.3. Tactical/Mission Event Training & Certification.
   7.3.1. Overview. This section establishes minimum requirements for tactical/mission
   certification training in supplemental aircraft. The unit operations officer will determine
   which crew members will obtain training in specific supplemental aircraft. The unit
   commander will ensure aircrew members completing this training meet the qualification
   training requirements. Most civilian supplemental aircraft training facilities do not have an
   equivalent to military tactical/mission training, and therefore it should be handled separately
   from initial aircraft training.
   7.3.2. General Requirements. For each specific tactical/mission event to be certified, the
   aircrew should already have been previously qualified (as documented by AF Form 8, or
   AF Form 4348) in that event on either a standard or additional aircraft. AFSOC/A3 may
   waive this requirement on a case-by-case basis. Prior to commencing tactical mission
   training, crew members should already meet the initial certification requirements,
   documented as described by Paragraph 7.2.2. Concurrent initial aircraft and mission event
   training may be authorized by the unit commander.
30                                                AFSOCI11-219V1 20 NOVEMBER 2013


  7.3.3. Priority of Acceptable Training Sources. To obtain specific mission event
  certification in supplemental aircraft, aircrew members should attend training courses
  according to the following protocol:
     7.3.3.1. If there is a USAF qualification course, aircrew should make every effort to
     attend and obtain an AF Form 8, via the AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 1, process.
     7.3.3.2. If a non-USAF DOD qualification or certification course is available, aircrew
     members will make every effort to attend the DOD course. Training will be
     accomplished in accordance with that agency’s training syllabus.              Non-USAF
     qualification courses should result in the award of a service or department specific
     certificate of qualification, certification, training completion, or a similar version of
     documentation. It will be the final judgment of the unit commander of the acceptability
     of the furnished completion documents.
     7.3.3.3. If a DOD course is not available or practical, aircrew members will try to obtain
     specific mission event training from an accredited flight school, in accordance with the
     FAR. The unit commander will determine if training provided by the flight school
     fulfills the tactical advisory requirements for the intended mission. For example, a
     civilian flight school may conduct free-fall parachutist training on a supplemental
     aircraft, and could be used for tactical mission event certification in high-altitude low-
     opening (HALO) airdrop. If an accredited flight school exists and can provide approved
     instruction, use the following protocol:
        7.3.3.3.1. Contracted flight training for pilots will be accomplished in accordance
        with FAR Part 141 if available, or Part 61. This training may result in a type rating,
        certificate of completion, specific log book endorsement, a letter of authorization, or
        as prescribed by FAR Part 141 or 61. It will be the final judgment of the unit
        commander of the acceptability of the furnished completion documents.
        7.3.3.3.2. If the aircraft does not have an FAA-type designation (a type designation is
        not necessarily a type rating), training will be in accordance with FAA Order
        8130.2G. This training may result in a foreign type rating or license, certificate of
        completion, specific log book endorsement, a letter of authorization, or some other
        miscellaneous type of documentation. It will be the final judgment of the unit
        commander of the acceptability of the furnished completion documents, as long as the
        program was in compliance with the FAA Order.
     7.3.3.4. Priority of Tactical Mission Training for Non-Pilot Aircrew.
        7.3.3.4.1. (Non-pilot aircrew) If mission type training for non-pilot crew positions
        is not available or not addressed by the FAR for the designated aircraft, these
        members may be trained and certified by a squadron instructor who is certified in that
        specific mission event on that aircraft, with over 50 hours in type.
        7.3.3.4.2. (Non-pilot aircrew) If a squadron instructor is not available, then the
        DOD or civilian agency providing the pilots’ training may train non-pilot aircrew
        members in similar mission events. The training agency must provide a detailed
        description of the instruction provided. It will be the final judgment of the unit
        commander to award specific mission event certification, based on the acceptability
        of the furnished completion report.
AFSOCI11-219V1 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                               31


         7.3.3.4.3. (Non-pilot aircrew) In specific cases (such as loadmasters), where
         instructor aircrew members are operating very similar tactical/mission
         systems/equipment in their standard aircraft, additional aircraft, or a different
         supplemental aircraft, HQ AFSOC/A3T may authorize direct certification. In all
         cases these aircrew members will be afforded the opportunity to familiarize
         themselves with nonstandard, but similar equipment. (T-2)
     7.3.3.5. There may be certain missions where a CAA crew member requires
     mission/tactical training and certification on a supplemental foreign aircraft after arrival
     to a forward deployed location. When, in the opinion of the mission commander, this
     mission necessity exists, the TSOC/J3 (or JSOTF/Joint Special Operations Air
     Component (JSOAC) if applicable), with AFSOC/A3 concurrence, may authorize local
     tactical/mission training and certification. This approval may be initially obtained
     verbally, if necessary for mission expedition, with MFR documentation to follow. (T-1)
         7.3.3.5.1. A training plan should be submitted to HQ AFSOC/A3T, as part of the
         AFSOC/A3 concurrence. The training plan should take into consideration the level
         of similarity between the intended supplemental aircraft and what aircraft the CAA is
         already qualified or certified to operate, as well as the experience level and
         proficiency of the intended instructor (i.e., fellow CAA teammate, civilian certified
         contractor, or PN instructor pilot).
         7.3.3.5.2. Upon successful completion of the training, certificates or documentation
         of completion, if applicable, will be faxed/scanned and sent home for inclusion in the
         crew member’s FEF and annotation on an AF Form 4348. The MFRs approving the
         downrange training will be kept in the member’s career training record.
         7.3.3.5.3. For emerging training requirements not identified and approved prior to
         departure, the requirements of this paragraph do not alleviate the mission commander
         from normal chain-of-command approval requirements stemming from a change of
         CONOPS/mission tasking.
  7.3.4. Ground Training Requirements. All mission/tactical event training must include, at a
  minimum, a review on the ground of all applicable normal procedures, operational
  limitations, and emergency procedures. Variations in the tactics and techniques for a given
  event should be discussed, clearly establishing what is procedure and what is technique. Any
  applicable AFM/POH or FAA guidance should be reviewed, and must be adhered to, if
  published. If the agency providing the tactical/mission training requires academic testing,
  CAAs must pass any administered exam to the standard of the testing agency.
  7.3.5. Flight Training Requirements.
     7.3.5.1. Tactical/Mission Flight Training. The requirements for each aircrew position
     will typically be established by the agency that provides the training. For DOD courses,
     the service-approved SOI for qualification should be used when practical. For contract
     flight training, a SOI that meets the FAA stated requirements (either FAR Part 61 or 141)
     should be used, if applicable.
     7.3.5.2. Minimum Flight Training Events. Tactical/mission event flight training will
     consist of a minimum of two sorties (three sorties for NVG-specific events). At a
     minimum, tactical/mission event flight training on a supplemental aircraft should include:
 32                                                 AFSOCI11-219V1 20 NOVEMBER 2013


          7.3.5.2.1. Normal procedures, to include all tactical checklists. Checklists involving
          time advisories will make every effort not to compress the times for training
          convenience. Low-level navigation training routes will be no less than 25 minutes in
          the low-level environment.
          7.3.5.2.2. Any applicable emergency procedures, specifically any published
          tactical/mission emergency procedures checklists.
          7.3.5.2.3. Aircrew must be NVG qualified on a standard or additional aircraft in
          order to conduct NVG training on a supplemental aircraft. Tactical/mission events
          must be flown at least once during a day sortie prior to training that event on NVGs.
          At no time will supplemental aircraft be flown with all external lighting turned off.
          At a minimum, the strobe light and position lights will be left on. Landings without
          use of the landing/taxi lights are authorized if they may be conducted safely and are
          not prohibited by the AFM/POH.
7.4. Currency and Continuation Training Requirements.
   7.4.1. Overview. Supplemental aircraft do not require the same level of currency or
   continuation training as standard or additional aircraft. Prior to operating a PN supplemental
   aircraft, aircrew members should receive refresher training, in order to meet the below
   requirements. In all cases, mission commanders will seek to deploy CAAs as proficient as
   possible in the intended aircraft and flying events.
   7.4.2. General Requirements. Aircrew members will meet the following requirements for
   currency and continuation training prior to operating a supplemental aircraft (not as a
   student).
      7.4.2.1. Aircrew members will not depart home station to operate supplemental aircraft if
      they are noncurrent in every aircraft they maintain qualification in (as defined by the
      applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Vol 1). If an aircrew member’s currency will expire while
      deployed, the mission commander may authorize continued flight operations on the
      supplemental aircraft.
      7.4.2.2. Aircrew must be BAQ on at least one standard or additional aircraft. If a
      member normally maintains MR status on a standard or additional aircraft, and is non-
      mission ready (NMR) due to failure to complete the requisite amount of continuation
      training events in the previous semiannual training period, or the aircrew member
      becomes unqualified (UQ), the following guidance applies:
          7.4.2.2.1. If an aircrew member is NMR for a basic aircraft qualification event (i.e.,
          LPS, emergency procedures sortie), or is UQ, that member is not authorized to fly as
          a primary crew member on a PN supplemental aircraft without group commander
          approval prior to departure. (T-3)
          7.4.2.2.2. If an aircrew member is NMR for a specific tactical/mission event, that
          member will not fly that event or similar type events on the PN supplemental aircraft
          without group commander approval prior to departure. (T-3)
          7.4.2.2.3. If the semiannual training period elapses while the aircrew member is
          deployed, and the member subsequently becomes NMR on an event on their home
          station aircraft, they may continue to fly that event on supplemental aircraft with
AFSOCI11-219V1 20 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                 33


          mission commander approval, provided they meet all of the currency requirements of
          this section.
       7.4.2.3. All aircrew will conduct initial or refresher ground egress training on the same
       type of supplemental aircraft within 60 days of departure, to include hands-on opening of
       all aircraft exits.
       7.4.2.4. Aircrew will accomplish a minimum of three refresher sorties within 60 days
       prior to departure. This may be done in conjunction with initial certification training, if
       applicable. These sorties will be, at a minimum; one local proficiency sortie, and two
       tactical/mission sorties (if applicable).
       7.4.2.5. If the aircrew is certified on the supplemental aircraft, but is not able to obtain
       the requisite predeparture currency training, alternate methods may be considered.
       Refresher training with a PN instructor pilot may be used, with group commander prior
       approval. This must be accomplished prior to conducting any flying advisory operations
       with non-instructor PN aircrew.
       7.4.2.6. While deployed, aircrew must accomplish one tactical sortie every 60 days in
       order to remain fully certified. If an aircrew member accomplishes local proficiency
       sorties but no tactical sorties after 60 days deployed, the member will revert to basic
       aircraft certification for the remainder of the deployment. If an aircrew member does not
       fly any sorties after 60 days deployed, the member is noncurrent and will not fly unless
       under direct supervision from an instructor. CAA aircrew members may regain currency
       with a PN instructor. If unable to regain currency from an instructor, resuming flight
       operations requires approval from AFSOC/A3. (T2)
7.5. Specialized Training.
   7.5.1. Instructor Upgrade. Advisory missions typically require CAAs to perform instructor-
   like duties in the specific supplemental aircraft to be employed. Additionally, certain
   countries require FAA CFI, MEI or Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) certifications in order to
   carry passengers while deployed.
       7.5.1.1. Supplemental aircraft FAA/civilian instructor certification should be
       accomplished in accordance with FAR Part 61 and/or FAA Order 8900.1, Flight
       Standards Information Management System (FSIMS), as applicable.
       7.5.1.2. The unit commander will make the determination of whether to award instructor
       certification on supplemental aircraft, considering type of training received, experience
       level, and FAA/civilian certifications awarded. Instructor status will be designated in an
       aircrew member’s AF Form 4348 for that supplemental aircraft, as per Paragraph 7.3.2.
       7.5.1.3. Awarding certification of instructor status on tactical/mission events will be
       determined and annotated separately. The unit commander will use common sense and
       best judgment on determining eligibility for instructor status in tactical/mission areas.
       There is no FAR guidance on instructor certification for military/tactical events.
   7.5.2. Evaluator Upgrade. CAA aircrew will not normally be designated as evaluators on
   supplemental aircraft. The authority to administer flight evaluations on supplemental aircraft
   to PN aircrew must be specifically identified in the operational order (OPORD) and funded
   appropriately. Doctrinally, CAAs should seek to avoid administering evaluations or
34                                                AFSOCI11-219V1 20 NOVEMBER 2013


  certifying evaluations of PN aircrew. Limit any evaluations to unofficial assessments
  provided to the PN chain of command. If a mission requires CAA aircrew to administer
  evaluations, then the upgrade training must be handled on a case-by-case basis, using the
  overall guiding principles of this chapter. Approval authority is AFSOC/A3.
  7.5.3. Augmentee Training. Flying augmentees are normally selected for mission support
  based upon their previous qualification in a specific supplemental aircraft. If an augmentee
  is required to fly as a primary aircrew member in PN supplemental aircraft, training should
  be scheduled to ensure the augmentee is current and qualified as per this chapter prior to
  accomplishing advisory duties. Flying augmentee requests require higher-level scrutiny.
  Approval for flying augmentees to operate supplemental aircraft is AFSOC/A3.

Terms
Advising—Advisory assistance (advising), as applied to the CAA mission, is provided to foreign
aviation units, US combatant commands, and other US agencies, and is conducted within the
context of specific times, places, and situations. It includes such product subsets as the
development and use of airpower doctrine; i.e., how to employ airpower (as opposed to how to
operate airplanes), force planning, operational sustainment methods, basing concepts, tactical
employment, and C4 development for specific times, places, and situations.
Additional Aircraft—Additional aircraft, as applies to this instruction are AFSOC owned or
leased aircraft not part of the enduring USAF inventory but are maintained and flown for the
purposes of CAA aircrew qualification and/or certification. Typically retained for use for a time
period exceeding 6 months. Typically requires a USAF Form 8 for aircrew to operate.
Certificated Flight Instructor (CFI)—An aircrew member authorized by the FAA to instruct in
civilian aircraft. “CFI-I” indicates certificated flight instructor with a qualification to instruct
instrument flight. “MEI” indicates certificated as multi-engine instructor.
Event—A training item to be accomplished. Multiple events may be completed and logged
during a sortie.
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)—The United States organization responsible for
governing all aspects of United States civil and military aviation.
Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs)—Regulations governing all aspects of United States
civil and military aviation. See Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations.
Multiple Qualification—A crew member that is qualified in more than one aircraft. Requires

Supplemental Aircraft—Aircraft which are not typically owned or leased by the USAF, and
typically used for less than 6 months for the purpose of advisory operations preparation and
execution. Does not require a USAF Form 8 to be operated by AFSOC aircrew as part of an
advisory mission or training.
Type—As used with respect to the certification, rating, privileges, and limitations of airmen,
means a specific make and basic model of aircraft including modifications that do not change its
handling or flight characteristics. Examples include CN-235, and DC-3.
