     for duties in the UV-18 aircraft. See Chapter 2 for IQT program requirements.
     1.2.2. Mission Qualification Training (MQT). This training is necessary to qualify
     aircrew for the unit’s mission or local-area requirements. This training may be incorporated
     in MAJCOM-approved IQT syllabi. See Chapter 3 for MQT program requirements.
     1.2.3. Continuation Training (CT). This training is necessary for qualified aircrew to
     maintain their assigned level of proficiency or increase flight qualifications. It provides
     minimum ground and flight training requirements. See Chapter 4 for CT program
     requirements.
     1.2.4. Specialized Training. This training is necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned
     missions, but is not required of every crewmember. Examples of specialized training include,
     but are not limited to, formation, instructor pilot (IP), and functional check flight (FCF) pilot.
     Individuals recognized by the unit will accomplish appropriate formal course training to
     qualify personnel in these specialized areas or comply with locally developed syllabi and
     squadron developed training programs. See Chapter 5 for specialized training program
     requirements.
1.3. Training Concepts and Policies:

     commander may approve training for individual pilots to basic aircraft qualified (BAQ) if
     there is minimal impact to the mission and adequate resources are available to support
     required nonmission sortie and event requirements. Document this authorization in the
     individual’s training folder.
AFI11-2UV-18V1 28 JUNE 2010                                                                      7


   1.3.3. Night vision goggles training is not authorized.
1.4. Training Records and Reports. Units will:
   1.4.1. Maintain aircrew records for individual training and evaluations according to AFI 11-
   202, Volume 1; AFI 11-202 Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program; and
   the RDS.

       remaining for the training cycle.
       1.4.7.4. Sortie and event currencies and expiration dates.
1.5. Pilot Utilization:
   1.5.1. Commanders will ensure assigned pilots fill only authorized positions as listed in unit
   manning documents (UMD) and pilot status is properly designated. The overall objective is
   for pilots to perform only operations-related duties. Supervisors may assign pilots to valid,
   short-term tasks (escort officer, flying evaluation board member, mishap board member,
   etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of pilot tasking, flying
   proficiency, currency, and experience.
   1.5.2. Duties required by various publications that may be assigned to aircrew position
   indicator (API)-1 pilots are quality assurance evaluator, programmer, flying safety officer,
   supervisor of flying, mobility contingency plans officer, training (except ARMS duties),
   aircrew flight equipment officer, and other duties directly related to flying operations. API-1s
   will not be attached to wing staffs or hold wing staff positions unless total wing pilot API-1
   and API-6 manning is 100 percent or better. Commanders will ensure wing staff pilots (API-
   6s) perform duties justified in MAJCOM manpower standards documents and authorized in
   the UMD.

                       INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING (IQT)

2.1. General:
   2.1.1. This chapter outlines the initial qualification training program for the UV-18. On
   completion of the program, pilots will be qualified in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume
   2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program; and AFI 11-2UV-18, Volume 2, UV-18
   Aircrew Evaluation Criteria; as first copilots (FC) or first pilots (FP). Note: Only one
   combined evaluation is required when pilots complete MQT in conjunction with IQT.
   2.1.2. Except in unusual circumstances, aircrew members undergoing qualification training
   will receive ground and flight instruction with a minimum of interruption and complete
   training within the time specified by the syllabus. Failure to complete training within the
   specified time limit requires notifying the gaining group commander of the individual’s name
   and grade, reason for delay, planned actions, and estimated completion date.
   2.1.3. Completion of IQT qualifies the copilot to fly in the right seat under the supervision of
   an aircraft commander or above. Completion of IQT qualifies the FP to fly in either seat
   under the supervision of an aircraft commander or above.
2.2. Prerequisites. Before entering qualification training, each aircrew member must comply
with the appropriate formal course training prerequisites prescribed in the formal course syllabus
and education and training course announcements (ETCA) at https://etca.randolph.af.mil. In
addition, before flying, all personnel maintaining flying status will meet the physical
examination, physiological training, and survival, evasion, resistance, and escape (SERE)
training requirements in AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
2.3. Ground Training. Ground training will follow the formal course syllabus flow. For in-unit
qualification training, commanders will obtain and use current formal school courseware, if
available.
2.4. Flying Training. Pilots in IQT will fly under IP supervision until completing the
qualification evaluation. Formal course syllabus mission objectives and tasks are minimum
requirements for IQT. Additional training due to student nonprogression is only available within
the constraints of the formal course syllabus. Pilots may satisfy MQT and specialized training
requirements during IQT if the appropriate IP is available and the formal course training allows.
2.5. Senior Officer Qualification. Comply with the guidance provided in AFI 11-401, Aviation
Management, and AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
2.6. Flight Surgeon (FS) Qualification. In accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 1, FS
training will consist of the following requirements:
   2.6.1. Ground Training. Ground training will include:
       2.6.1.1. Aircraft general review.
       2.6.1.2. An instrument and emergency procedures review with an IP.
       2.6.1.3. Cockpit/crew resource management (CRM) training according to AFI 11-290,
       Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program.

       2.6.1.6. The completion of an FS qualification examination according to AFI 11-202,
       Volume 2.
   2.6.2. Flying Training. For flying training upon completion of ground training, an FS is
   qualified to occupy the right seat during UV-18 missions with an IP at the controls. An FS
   will not operate the controls during critical phases of flight. Without an IP onboard, an FS
   must occupy a seat in the troop compartment.
2.7. Requalification Training. An aircrew member is unqualified upon expiration of his or her
qualification evaluation or loss of currency exceeding 6 months (paragraph 4.7). Follow the
requalification guidance in AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and paragraph 4.8 in this instruction.
2.8. Conversion and Difference Qualifications. Conversion qualification follows the guidance
in this chapter and the formal course conversion syllabus. Difference qualification is not
authorized.
2.9. Multiple Qualification. Qualification in more than one mission design series (MDS) is
authorized in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 1. Multiple qualification requires completion
of IQT as specified in this chapter.

                      MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING (MQT)

3.1. General. MQT upgrades pilots who have completed IQT to MR status. MQT is normally
conducted in conjunction with IQT (paragraph 2.1.1). At the completion of MQT, the squadron
commander certifies the pilot as a MR pilot (MP) or copilot (MC).
3.2. Prerequisites:
   3.2.1. Completion of IQT unless conducted in conjunction with MQT.
   3.2.2. Additional unit specified prerequisites for MQT.
3.3. Ground Training. Units will maintain lesson plans for MQT ground training. When MQT
is not conducted in conjunction with IQT, minimum ground training will consist of:
   3.3.1. Jump pattern procedures and a jumpmaster briefing.
   3.3.2. Local operating procedures.
   3.3.3. Emergency procedures with jumpers on board, including low-altitude engine failure
   and inadvertent parachute opening in the aircraft.
   3.3.4. Oxygen requirements for jumpers.
   3.3.5. Weather requirements for jump operations.
3.4. Flying Training. When MQT is not conducted in conjunction with IQT:
   3.4.1. Copilots will accomplish at least one sortie, and pilots will accomplish at least two
   sorties.
   3.4.2. The upgrade pilot should practice:
       3.4.2.1. Load limit calculations.
       3.4.2.2. Jump crew coordination.
       3.4.2.3. Local operating procedures.
       3.4.2.4. Wind drift indicator drop and pattern.
       3.4.2.5. Jump pattern procedures.
       3.4.2.6. Jump operations (with actual jumpers).
3.5. Training Completion. Pilots must complete MQT within the training time prescribed in
the formal course syllabus. The OG commander is waiver authority for training time extensions.
Units will document this waiver in the individual’s training folder. Units may consider MQT
complete after successful completion of a mission evaluation.
3.6. Documentation. Document MQT in the individual’s training folder.
3.7. Sorties. When MQT is not conducted in conjunction with IQT, units will log MQT sorties
as mission support sorties. MQT sorties and events may be used to meet the CT sortie and event
requirements for the upgrade pilot during the training cycle in which they are flown.

                             CONTINUATION TRAINING (CT)

4.1. General. This chapter outlines the minimum training and currencies required for UV-18
qualified aircrew. Units may direct additional training in a supplement to this instruction. Units
will track all ground and flying training requirements in ARMS. (Refer to ETCA for ancillary
training.)
4.2. Training Cycle. There are two CT training cycles 1 January to 30 June, and 1 July to 31
December of each calendar year.
4.3. Quarterly Meetings:
   4.3.1. CT Meetings. Commanders will direct and supervise quarterly CT meetings. The
   purpose of these meetings is to discuss standardization and mission-related topics and to
   increase general knowledge. A CRM topic or scenario will be discussed in each CT meeting
   referring to CRM core concepts from AFI 11-290.
   4.3.2. IP Meetings. Commanders will direct and supervise quarterly IP meetings.
   Commanders will use these meetings to discuss standardization, instructional techniques,
   grading practices, and recent trends. They may be combined with CT meetings if all topics
   are adequately covered.
   4.3.3. Attendance. Attendance at CT and IP meetings is mandatory. The unit will determine
   a method to track attendance of CT and IP meetings as part of the go/no-go process for flight.
   Individuals who are not available for CT or IP meetings will read the meeting minutes or be
   briefed by an operations supervisor before their next flight.
4.4. Ground Training. Table 4.1 summarizes pilot ground training requirements. For ground
training prescribed by other instructions, units must refer to those instructions for the latest
requirement. Initial ground training accomplished during IQT and MQT may be credited toward
CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished.

 2. Counts toward total landings.
 3. Credits nonprecision approaches.
 4. Required for certified FP, MPs, and IPs.
4.6. Failure To Complete Semiannual Requirements. Failure to complete sortie or event
requirements at the end of the training cycle will automatically result in regression until a review
is completed to determine continued or additional training. Refer to AFI 11-402, Aviation and
Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, for guidance on aviation service
suspension when failure to complete requirements is within the member’s control. Note: Refer to
paragraph 4.13 for guidance on prorating requirements.
   4.6.1. Regression. MR pilots will regress to BAQ status, and BAQ pilots will regress to
   unqualified status (N-BAQ). N-BAQ pilots will not fly in the new training cycle until the
   review is completed unless supervised by an IP. Pilots regressed from MR to BAQ may
   continue to fly as an FP or FC under the supervision of an IP until the review is completed.
   4.6.2. Required Review. The reviewer should consider the type and magnitude of the
   deficiency and the pilot’s experience level to determine if additional training, increased
   supervision, or a waiver to the previous training cycle requirements is warranted. The OG
   commander (the NAF DO for a NAF FE) is the reviewer and waiver authority. Document
   this review in the individual’s training folder.
4.7. Flying Training Currencies. Table 4.3 defines currency requirements for all UV-18
pilots. Any pilot not meeting currency requirements (except for jump currency) will not perform
the sortie or event except under the supervision of an IP. Refer to Attachment 4 for guidance on
logging sorties and events for currency and re-currency.

 Notes:
 1. Pilots not current in this sortie or event require IP supervision on all flights.
 2. Only required for certified pilots.
 3. Night landings count toward landing currency.
4.8. Requalification Training. For all aircrew personnel except FSs, requalification
requirements follow the guidance in AFI 11-202, Volume 1. A flight evaluation will complete
the requalification process in accordance with AFI 11-2UV-18, Volume 2.
   4.8.1. Table 4.3 lists currency items affecting BAQ.
   4.8.2. When authorized by AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and approved by the OG commander,
   pilots may complete a locally generated training program. For this training, the squadron
   commander will develop an individual program that takes into account the pilot’s previous
   experience and currency. The unit will send a copy of the proposed training program to the
   NAF DO for approval.
4.9. Loss of IP Status:
   4.9.1. An IP will be decertified for one of the following:
       4.9.1.1. Failing a flight evaluation. To regain IP status, the IP must successfully complete
       a flight evaluation according to AFI 11-2UV-18, Volume 2.
       4.9.1.2. Failing a qualification or instrument written examination. To regain IP status, the
       IP must successfully reaccomplish the written examination.
   4.9.2. If an IP becomes noncurrent in an event or sortie listed in Table 4.3, his or her IP
   status may be retained. However, the IP will not instruct in that event or sortie until the
   required currency is regained. Supervision by another IP is required to regain currency.
4.10. Multiple Qualification Requirements. Individuals qualified in more than one MDS will
complete all of the flying training requirements of this chapter in the UV-18.
4.11. Flight Surgeon (FS) Requirements. FSs will accomplish CT in accordance with AFI 11-
202, Volume 1.

   18 IP course. Flying training will include an instructor evaluation as defined in AFI 11-202,
   Volume 2.
5.5. Buddy IP (BIP) Training. Units will assign each new IP to an experienced BIP sponsor
who will monitor the new IP’s performance and provide guidance in all IP duties until the new
IP has completed the ground and flying training requirements provided in paragraphs 5.5.2 and
5.5.3. The squadron commander may waive BIP requirements for rated pilots with previous
instructor experience. Units will document this waiver in the individual’s training folder.
   5.5.1. Prerequisite. Pilots must complete MQT before enrolling in BIP training.
   5.5.2. Ground Training. Before flying with students, units will ensure each new IP is
   briefed on unit policies, the BIP program, instructor responsibilities, grading practices, CT
   requirements, scheduling, student training folder management, ground and flying safety, and
   stan/eval procedures.
   5.5.3. Flying Training. The flying training portion of the BIP program consists of two
   different kinds of sorties, BIP sorties (with the new IP) and sponsor sorties (with the new IP’s
   students).
       5.5.3.1. BIP Sorties. The BIP will fly a minimum of one sortie with the new IP during
       the course of the BIP program. The objective of this sortie is to further develop the new
       IP’s instructional techniques. During the sortie, the BIP will discuss instructional
AFI11-2UV-18V1 28 JUNE 2010                                                                   19

                            TRAINING SORTIES AND EVENTS

A4.1. CT Sortie:
   A4.1.1. A CT sortie will include traffic pattern stalls or power-on stalls; slow flight or steep
   turns; precision and nonprecision approaches (one simulated single-engine); single-engine
   landing; single-engine go-around or missed approach; visual flight rules (VFR) traffic
   pattern; 0-, 10-, and 20-degree flap landings; and full-flap landing (IP only) on a single
   sortie. (Exceptions: If circumstances prevent completion of all CT sortie events on one
   sortie, pilots may credit a CT sortie after completing remaining events on a second sortie. IPs
   may credit a CT sortie when completing all events on multiple sorties within 30 calendar
   days.) Copilots do not require single-engine events.
   A4.1.2. Instructors should tailor the CT sortie to the individual pilot’s needs, placing
   particular emphasis on simulated systems malfunctions, single engine operations, and
   instrument procedures.
   A4.1.3. Pilots should also accomplish holding, arcing, fix-to-fix, circling, unusual attitude
   recoveries, and a minimum controlled airspeed (Vmc) demonstration (IP only) as required to
   maintain proficiency.
   A4.1.4. Pilots will log a CT sortie on all qualification evaluations.
A4.2. Night Sortie. Accomplish at least two night landings during the period after evening civil
twilight and before morning civil twilight as published in the Air Almanac.
A4.3. Out-and-Back Mission. Accomplish a minimum of two sorties with a full-stop landing
and engine shutdown at other than the home station.
A4.4. Jump Sortie. Perform a simulated or actual wind direction indicator drop and simulated
or actual drop of jumpers to update currency. Regain jump sortie currency by flying a jump
profile (simulated or actual) with a current MP or IP.
A4.5. Landing. Log a landing when performing any 0-, 10-, 20-, or full-flap landing. Loss of
landing currency affects BAQ and requires the following action (timing starts from date of last
landing):
   A4.5.1. For 46 through 90 days, regain landing currency by accomplishing three successful
   landings (preferably one each of 0-, 10-, and 20-degree flap settings) under the supervision of
   a current IP.
   A4.5.2. For 91 through 135 days, perform the same actions as in paragraph A4.5.1, plus an
   instructor-supervised review session (normal, emergency, and instrument procedures).
   A4.5.3. For 136 through 180 days, perform the same actions as in paragraphs A4.5.2, plus an
   IP-supervised CT sortie, qualification written examinations, and emergency procedures
   evaluation (EPE). Documentation of AF Form 8 is not required.
   A4.5.4. For more than 180 days, perform requalification training in accordance with AFI 11-
   202, Volume 1, and paragraph 4.8 of this instruction. The NAF DO will approve a locally
   administered qualification program if it includes an instrument and qualification evaluation
   with all requisites completed.

A4.6. Night Landing. Accomplish landings during the period after evening civil twilight and
before morning civil twilight as published in the Air Almanac. Regain night landing currency by
accomplishing two night landings with a current IP.
A4.7. Formation Sorties. Accomplish a minimum of one takeoff, departure, rejoin, jump
position, wing work, and position change as lead or wing. Regain formation currency by flying
an entire formation profile with a current formation IP.
A4.8. Instrument Approach. Accomplish a precision or nonprecision approach, including an
EFIS-out approach. Regain instrument approach currency by flying an instrument approach
under the supervision of an IP.
A4.9. EFIS-Out Approach. Accomplish a non-precision instrument approach using the
standby attitude indicator, standby altimeter, standby airspeed indicator, and RMI as the primary
references.
A4.10. Emergency Procedures Simulator. Conduct EP training in a Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA)-approved training facility for the aircraft’s civil variant. An emergency
procedure (EP) simulator conducted during IQT may be credited towards this requirement.
A4.11. Situational Emergency Procedures Training. Review each emergency procedure
outlined in Section III of TO 1U-18(V)B-1 with an IP. Preferably accomplish SEPT one on one.
However, small, flight-sized groups are allowed so all members can participate to the fullest
extent and share equal time responding to emergency situations. Teaching SEPT may satisfy the
SEPT requirement for the IP who administers the training. SEPT may also be accomplished in-
flight, in a static aircraft, in a cockpit trainer, or in an FAA-approved training facility for the
aircraft’s civil variant EP simulator.
