                                                 Chapter 1

                                      SORTS GENERAL POLICY

1.1. SORTS. SORTS is an internal management tool for use by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
(CJCS), Services, Unified Commands, and Combat Support Agencies. It is the single automated reporting
system within the Department of Defense (DoD) functioning as the central registry of all operational units
of the US Armed Forces and certain foreign organizations. SORTS has a threefold purpose: it provides
data critical to crisis planning, provides for the deliberate or peacetime planning process, and is used by
the Chief of Staff United States Air Force (CSAF) and subordinate commanders in assessing their effec-
tiveness in meeting Title 10, “United States Code,” responsibilities to organize, train, and equip forces for
combatant commands. All units with a United States Air Force (USAF) Personnel Accounting Symbol
(PAS) code will be registered in SORTS.
     1.1.1. As a monitoring system of measured units and resources, SORTS indicates the C-level of
     selected resources and training status required to undertake the full mission set for which a unit was
     organized or designed. It also collects and distributes Service-unique information regarding a mea-
     sured unit.
     1.1.2. The Air Force (AF) uses SORTS status information in assessing readiness, determining bud-
     getary allocation and management action impacts on unit level readiness, answering congressional
     inquiries, analyzing readiness trends, and supporting readiness decisions.
     1.1.3. SORTS provides broad bands of information on selected unit status indicators which include
     the commander’s assessment of the unit’s ability to execute the mission set for which it is organized
     or designed. Measurement criteria is designed and developed by Functional Area Managers (FAM) to
     provide valid assessments regarding unit readiness. Commanders, or their designated alternates,
     assess measurements against their mission set to determine if they provide a realistic indication of the
     unit’s readiness. It is critical that reporting commanders identify those areas that are rated less than
     desired in order to promote and justify corrective action (including funding, personnel and equipment
     allocations.)
        1.1.3.1. SORTS is not designed to function as a detailed information management system objec-
        tively counting all conceivable variables regarding personnel, training, and logistics.
        1.1.3.2. SORTS is not designed to be used as input for the performance appraisal of a unit or a
        unit commander.
            1.1.3.2.1. SORTS indicates a unit’s ability to undertake their full mission (Primary DOC
            Statement) or particular mission(s) (Secondary or Tertiary DOC Statements).
            1.1.3.2.2. SORTS may also provide indications of the efficacy of resource allocation deci-
            sions and the impacts of budgetary constraints on resourcing unit requirements.
        1.1.3.3. A fundamental premise of SORTS reporting is integrity. Commanders must “tell it like it
        is” (in accordance with (IAW) paragraphs 1.10.7. and 1.10.8.) and not allow masking of deficien-
        cies to affect their ability to provide capability or other readiness related information. Risk must be
        balanced with responsibility. Effective management of unit resources requires accurate informa-
        tion at all levels.

   1.1.4. When deployed/employed in response to a crisis or operations order (OPORD), SORTS pro-
   vides both an assessment of a unit’s status based on ability to execute the mission set for which it was
   organized or designed and, when appropriate, the mission against which it is employed.
   1.1.5. Records Maintenance. Records prescribed by this instruction will be maintained IAW Air
   Force Manual (AFMAN) 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule.
   1.1.6. In the event of conflict between this AFI and MAJCOM Supplements or Unit DOCs, AFI guid-
   ance will take precedence. Concerned parties will contact the HQ USAF/XOOA office for resolution.

1.2. Measured Units Reporting Requirement. Measured units are all planned and actual (JTF) HQs,
combat, combat support, combat services support units including Active, Air National Guard, AF
Reserves and provisional units apportioned to or deployed in support of a CJCS or combatant com-
mand-directed OPLAN, Concept Plans, SIOP, Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03 or Volume 3 of the
USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP-3), or assigned in the “Forces For Unified Commands” docu-
ment. Measured units will be named on a DOC Statement (DOCS) and must report SORTS in accordance
with their DOCS. One exception is training units that report only Major Equipment Location and Crew
Information (MEQLOCN). Measured unit SORTS reporting begins as soon as possible after a unit acti-
vates and continues until the unit deactivates.
   1.2.1. Provisional and task organized combat, combat support and combat service support units are
   also designated as measured units. The Service component or Combatant Commander (CC) directing
   the establishment of a measured unit will determine the organizational reporting structure of the unit.
   1.2.2. Air Force measured units may include any units registered in SORTS. Registered units include
   PAS coded units, fragments of PAS coded units and composite units such as fleets (e.g., airlift, tanker,
   etc.). Composite reports are in addition to and do not replace normal measured unit SORTS reporting
   requirements.
   1.2.3. SORTS measurement baseline. Regardless of the source of a unit's tasking or the extent of unit
   capability tasked in OPLANS, etc., SORTS measurement is based on the unit's full wartime require-
   ment for which it was organized or designed. This baseline is reflected in the definition of C-1. This
   baseline can exceed the unit's OPLAN tasking(s). To fulfill this measurement requirement, the unit's
   primary DOC Statement must include the maximum tasking(s), including both in-place and mobility
   wartime missions, the unit can simultaneously support within its current resource authorizations.
   When properly updated with a unit’s complete in-place and mobility tasking(s), the AFWUS is a sin-
   gle source reference for a unit's designed capability. Units are required to measure and report on all
   resources identified on their DOC Statement(s) even if the resources are not yet delivered (e.g., equip-
   ment for a newly assigned UTC) or if it is not possible to accomplish a task, such as small arms qual-
   ification. If required, waivers for SORTS reporting must to be coordinated through HQ USAF/
   XOOA.
       1.2.3.1. Personnel Measurement Baseline.
          1.2.3.1.1. Primary, secondary and tertiary DOC Statement reports. The baseline for measur-
          ing personnel is the unit's full wartime requirement for personnel based on either Unit Man-
          ning Document (UMD) authorizations or UTC requirements. See paragraph 3.1. Training is
          not measured in the personnel measured area.
          1.2.3.1.2. CBDRT reports used in SORTS do not report the personnel measured area. See
          Attachment 4.
12                                                          AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


        1.2.3.2. Equipment and Supplies O/H Measurement Baseline.
            1.2.3.2.1. Primary, secondary and tertiary DOC Statement reports. The baseline for measur-
            ing equipment and supplies is the unit's full wartime requirement for the items being mea-
            sured. The required numbers for the items are based on authorization documents such as
            Allowance Standards (AS), Air Staff-level functional area guidance, MRSP lists, equipment
            and supplies lists, or UTC requirements, depending on the unit's mission(s). See Chapter 4.
            Equipment condition is normally not to be measured in the Equipment and Supplies O/H mea-
            sured area.
            1.2.3.2.2. CBDRT reports used in SORTS will base the equipment and supplies O/H area on
            the unit's full wartime requirement for the equipment items and the condition of the items
            being measured. See Attachment 4.
        1.2.3.3. Equipment Condition Measurement Baseline.
            1.2.3.3.1. Primary, secondary and tertiary DOC Statement reports. The Equipment Condition
            measured area measures the condition of possessed equipment and supplies. See Chapter 5.
            1.2.3.3.2. CBDRT reports used in SORTS include equipment condition measurements in the
            equipment and supplies O/H measured area. See Attachment 4.
        1.2.3.4. Training Measurement Baseline.
            1.2.3.4.1. Primary, secondary and tertiary DOC Statement reports. The baseline for measur-
            ing training is the personnel assigned to the unit that require the training event or category
            being measured. See Chapter 6.
            1.2.3.4.2. CBDRT reports used in SORTS measure training in the training measured area.
            Measured training is based on the unit's full wartime requirement of personnel for the training
            event or category being measured. See Attachment 4.

1.3. Frequency of SORTS Reporting. All measured units (Active, Reserve, and Guard) will continu-
ously monitor changes in the overall unit level, resource category levels, and unit location. Units must
report no later than every 30 days (in order for messages to process by the mandated 31 day maximum) or
when changes affect the unit’s Overall C-level, the four measured area levels, associated reason codes,
deployed reason codes, get well/get worse date changes, and when desired by the measured unit com-
mander. See Chapter 2, paragraph 2.4., for further information.
1.3. (ACC) FREQUENCY OF SORTS REPORTING. ACC SORTS reports will be submitted within
a 12-calendar day window. The reporting window opens on the first day of the last full week of the month
(Monday -- Friday, regardless of holidays, down days, etc.) and closes on Friday of the following week
(12th calendar day). Reports will not be over 30-days old in the database.
     1.3.1. Command Reporting Organizations (CRO) submit waiver requests for reporting requirements
     or changes to reporting frequency through HQ USAF/XOOA to the Joint Staff (JS). Units submit their
     waiver requests to their CRO.
     1.3.2. Composite/aggregate unit reports must be received within 96 hours of the oldest individual
     unit’s; Report Date of Change of Category Information (RICDA).
     1.3.3. If unit status has not changed since the last report an OVERALL set must be submitted to
     reflect an updated RICDA date and any remarks in the database will be updated with the current date.
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                         13


1.4. SORTS Data Classification. Executive Order (EO) 12958, “Classified National Security Informa-
tion,” requires us to protect classified information while striking a balance between protection and the
need to inform the American public of their governmental activities. Also, this EO increases and empha-
sizes personal responsibility for classification and declassification decisions. The procedures for classifi-
cation and marking of classified documents are specified in DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security
Program, DoD 5200.1-PH, DoD Guide to Marking Classified Documents; and AFI 31-401, Information
Security Program Management.”
   1.4.1. Derivative Classification. Derivative classification is the incorporating, paraphrasing, restat-
   ing, or generating, in a new form, already classified information and marking newly developed mate-
   rial consistent with the classification that applies to the source information.
   1.4.2. Derivative Classifier. Persons applying derivative classification markings must carry forward
   to any newly created document the classification markings from the original source.
   1.4.3. SORTS Readiness Data. Measured area category levels, overall category levels, numbers
   used to compute percentages and the percentages (when associated with SORTS), reason codes asso-
   ciated with their remarks, and limiting factors for a single unit, are, at a minimum, classified CONFI-
   DENTIAL. Products that contain data from two or more measured units is classified SECRET
   NOFORN. Additionally, individuals classifying SORTS reports must consider other classification
   guidance including OPLANS. The association of the unit with its OPLAN(s) tasking is classified at
   the level of classification of the OPLAN(s), usually SECRET. Information that is not SORTS based
   and does not show a deficiency may still require classification through channels other than SORTS.
   Unit and Wing Security Managers should be consulted in these events.
       1.4.3.1. SORTS Worksheets/Briefing Slides reflecting measured unit data, as described above,
       will be given the same classification level as the material from which it was derived. Although
       sources (worksheets, e-mails, etc.) used to compile a unit’s SORTS data may be unclassified, once
       compiled and associated with SORTS ratings, it becomes classified at the highest level associated
       with the data (see Table 1.3.).
       1.4.3.2. Aggregate SORTS data will be classified at the same or higher level as the highest classi-
       fied component parts or segments of SORTS data. SORTS data converted to a new type informa-
       tion must be evaluated for its impact on national security if released. See Table 1.3. for further
       guidance.
       1.4.3.3. C-5 Authorization messages (giving that a unit is authorized to, not that they are reporting
       C-5) are Unclassified provided notification does not contain the unit’s current C-level (C1-5) or
       specific information, e.g., limiting factors, operational plans, etc..
       1.4.3.4. (Added-ACC) Any data that can be calculated into a sub area percentage or a percentage
       that establishes a C-level is classified. Ensure worksheets and presentation materials for SORTS
       are classified appropriately to include all references to DOC response times and special mission
       capabilities.
   1.4.4. Classification Authority. The JS SORTS database is classified SECRET. Information extracted
   from this database is classified IAW CJCSM 3150.02, “Global Status of Resources and Training Sys-
   tem (GSORTS),” and must contain derivative classification markings consistent with DoD 5200.1R,
   except where authorized otherwise. Derivative classification rules apply when extracts contain
   exempted data. If no classified source exists, use CJCSM 3150.02 as classification authority. Use
   "Derived From: CJCSM 3150.02, Global Status of Resources and Training System (GSORTS),
14                                                            AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


     Declassify On: (date)” to mark material when this reference is used as classification guidance. The
     date of declassification is four years from the date of the document for CONFIDENTIAL and eight
     years for SECRET. If other sources direct a classification higher or for a longer period, list the classi-
     fication guidance as the authority and list the specific sources on the file copy.
     1.4.5. Downgrading Authority. Initial downgrading of SORTS data and aggregate information will
     be determined by CJCS. The HQ USAF Deputy Chief of Staff, Air and Space Operations (HQ USAF/
     XO) is the authority to extend or accelerate downgrading classification of SORTS data following an
     initial determination by CJCS.

1.5. Releasing SORTS Data to Outside Agencies. CJCSI 5714.01, “Release Procedures for Joint Staff
and Joint Papers and Information,” sets the policy for release of SORTS data to agencies not on original
distribution.
     1.5.1. Policy: All holders of SORTS data must take action to protect against unauthorized disclosure
     and to preserve the statutory relationship of the CJCS, as principal military adviser, and the Joint
     Chiefs of Staff (JCS) as military advisors to the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF). Authorized holders
     of AF SORTS data can release it only to military components, or assigned or apportioned units, with
     a valid need-to-know and appropriate clearance. Exceptions to this policy must be coordinated
     through HQ USAF/XOOA.
     1.5.2. Specific policies for auditors, the Congress, and the general public: Auditors and inspectors of
     the General Accounting Office (GAO) or the Office of the DoD Inspector General (IG) have legal
     authority under Public Laws 96-226 and 97-252 for access. Only the President and SecDef can deny
     final access. Refer denial proposals to HQ USAF/XOOA for submission to the JS.
        1.5.2.1. Release data to Congress and its committees, staff, and investigators according to DoD
        Directive 5400.4, “Provision of Information to the Congress.”
        1.5.2.2. Responses to requests for SORTS data from the public under provisions of the Freedom
        of Information Act must be coordinated with HQ USAF SORTS, JS, and the Freedom of Informa-
        tion Act processing office.
        1.5.2.3. (Added-ACC) Releasing SORTS Data to the Public. Requests for SORTS information
        will be coordinated through HQ ACC/A3XR prior to release. Include in the package the data to be
        released in the format intended for disclosure, the date and time data base snapshot used or the
        time frame of the compiled data and the medium or forum and date of disclosure. However, if any
        portion of the requested data is denied or request cites the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA),
        process through the FOIA Office. FOIA Office will coordinate through HQ ACC/A3XR, who in
        turn will coordinate with the AF Operational Readiness Division (HQ AF/A3OR). Approval will
        be for the specified data and event only.
     1.5.3. Preferred Methods for Release. Only the minimum amount of information will be released to
     satisfy a request. Preferred methods in rank order are:
        1.5.3.1. Access to a specific part or parts of the database in a controlled environment.
        1.5.3.2. Access to a major subset or the entire database in a controlled environment.
        1.5.3.3. Release of a specific part or parts of the database or minor subset.
        1.5.3.4. Release of a major subset of the entire database.
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                     15


1.6. Information Reported in SORTS.
   1.6.1. Reported Unit Identification Code (RPTDUIC) set. This set establishes the identity of each
   individual reporting unit by their Unit Identity Code (UIC).
   1.6.2. Basic Identity Data Element (BIDE) set. Set applies to all registered units, includes the Unit
   Descriptor Code (UDC), unit abbreviated name (ANAME), UTC, Unit Level Code (ULC), Major
   Command (MJCOM for BIDE) under which the unit is organized, and unit Long Name (LNAME).
   Only CROs (MAJCOM SORTS office or equivalent) report this data.
   1.6.3. Reporting Organization (RPTNORG), Losing Organization (LOSING), Gaining Organization
   (GAINING), and Transfer Status (TRANSFER) sets. The RPTNORG set includes each unit’s CRO
   (Reporting Organization UIC (RPTOR) field) and Subordinate Reporting Unit (SBRPT). Only CROs
   report LOSING, GAINING, and TRANSFER sets to manage unit reporting organizations.
   1.6.4. General Status Organization and Location (ORGLOCN). ORGLOCN applies to all registered
   units, includes codes for CC/Service Command (CSERV), commands with Operational Control
   (OPCON), Administrative Control (ADCON), unit’s Home Geographical Location (HOGEO) and
   Present Geographical Location (PRGEO), Activity Code (ACTIV), and Percent Effective (PCTEF).
   Only CROs report this data with the exception of PCTEF, which is reported by the measured unit.
   1.6.5. Reserve Component Organization Status (RESERVES) set. Includes duty location, activity,
   mobilization or call-up date, and gaining command for units mobilized. HQ Air Force Reserve Com-
   mand (HQ AFRC) and the National Guard Bureau (NGB) report this data according to CJCSM
   3150.02.
   1.6.6. Personnel Strength Status (PERSTREN) set. The Air Force reports wartime authorized,
   assigned, possessed, deployable, and tasked deployable strengths. Unit authorizations are maintained
   by the MAJCOM and in the UMD. MAJCOMs will provide guidance for units to identify wartime
   personnel authorizations. In peacetime, the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) reports assigned and
   available data. When CJCS directs an increased reporting frequency, measured units report personnel
   strength status as directed.
   1.6.7. Resources and Training Status (Type of Report (TREAD), OVERALL, PERSONNEL, Equip-
   ment Supplies O/H (EQSUPPLY), Equipment Condition (EQCONDN), TRAINING, FORECAST,
   Category Limit (CATLIM) and Remarks fields. Fields apply to all measured units that report status
   for one or more DOC Statements. SORTS DOC Statements (AF Form (AFF) 723 or approved facsim-
   ile) summarize and provide source information for the mission(s) for which the unit is organized or
   designed. All unit SORTS data is available to all authorized Global Command and Control System
   (GCCS) GSORTS customers. While there are exceptions, Unified Commanders and the JS primarily
   look to joint data elements (Overall C-level and reason code, the four measured area levels and reason
   codes, and the associated remarks). AF FAMs look at detailed data, analyze information for trends,
   and direct appropriate actions in response to lowered C-levels.
      1.6.7.1. Plain language supplemental remarks can be reported for any SORTS data field that con-
      tains information. These remarks are a critical component of the SORTS report and are frequently
      used as a management tool.
      1.6.7.2. Remarks are allowed in the database through 3 increments of 2000 + 2000 + 1000 char-
      acters for a maximum total of 5000 characters per remark. On rare occasions a remark may be lim-
      ited to 2000 or less characters.
16                                                             AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


        1.6.7.3. (Added-ACC) All ACC units are required to update remarks at least once every 30 days
        to ensure the remarks are no older than 30 days from the last report based on the Report Date of
        Change of Category Information (RICDA) date.
     1.6.8. Major Equipment Location and Crew Status (MEQLOCN) set. MEQLOCN is reported in unit
     SORTS reports for those units possessing major equipment (aircraft, missiles, etc.). This set includes
     major equipment (MEQPT) and crew status at a unit's present and deployed locations. See Attachment
     five for further guidance.

1.7. SORTS Designed Operational Capability (DOC) Statement (AFF 723) or approved facsimile).
CJCS SORTS policy requires a unit’s Overall C-level to be based on an assessment of those resources and
training required to undertake a unit’s wartime mission(s). The purpose for a SORTS DOC Statement is
to provide units with a single source document of the information necessary and the location of the refer-
ences specifying resources to measure and report in SORTS. They also provide a narrative description of
the unit’s wartime mission(s). All SORTS DOC Statements will be completed on a standard or computer
generated AFF 723 or an XOOA approved facsimile.
     1.7.1. There are three types of SORTS DOC Statements. The Primary Mission DOC Statement must
     reflect the unit’s full wartime mission set (all unit wartime missions, i.e., in-place, mobility, Air Expe-
     ditionary Force (AEF), etc.) and is assigned DOC Number (DOCNR) one. Secondary Mission DOC
     Statements will reflect all resources necessary to undertake a major portion of the primary mission and
     are numbered sequentially using DOCNRs 2 through 9. Units with more than eight secondary mis-
     sions will coordinate with HQ USAF SORTS for additional DOCNRs. Secondary DOC Statements
     are normally written for single missions such as mobility. Tertiary Mission DOC Statements will
     reflect all resources necessary to undertake ancillary missions. A Tertiary DOC Statement is normally
     given a DOC number from A-J (K-Z are reserved per HQ USAF SORTS).
     1.7.2. SORTS DOC Statements are not used to establish, organize, design, equip, or task units. Need
     statements, ASs, UMDs, OPLANs, UTCs, AFWUS, etc., serve these functions.
     1.7.3. In coordination with the CRO, FAMs must ensure SORTS DOC Statements are written to
     reflect the wartime capability units are committed to deliver at execution.
     1.7.4. SORTS DOC Statements are approved by the MAJCOM SORTS DOC Statement Approval
     Authority (e.g., ANG SORTS DOC Statements are approved by the ANG SORTS office (ANG/
     XOOX)). DOC Statements involving multiple MAJCOMs, such as gaining unit issues, must be
     approved by all MAJCOMs involved.
     1.7.5. CROs must provide the following agencies with the SORTS DOC Statement upon approval by
     the CRO.
        1.7.5.1. HQ USAF SORTS.
        1.7.5.2. Interested MAJCOMs.
        1.7.5.3. Initial gaining MAJCOMs.
        1.7.5.4. Parent MAJCOM functional offices.
        1.7.5.5. Parent MAJCOM manpower offices.
        1.7.5.6. Subordinate reporting organizations.
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                         17


   1.7.6. HQ AFRC and the NGB will provide interested parties a copy of SORTS DOC Statement(s)
   within 45 days of approval.
   1.7.7. Subordinate reporting organizations must make SORTS DOC Statements available to mea-
   sured units, direct support units, and functional offices.
   1.7.7. (ACC) SROs will acknowledge receipt and understanding (ARU) to HQ ACC/A3XR within
   the suspense time listed in the release message for new DOC statements.
   1.7.8. Recipients at all levels must review new SORTS DOC Statements and forward any comments
   to the FAM.
   1.7.9. SORTS DOC Statements must be reviewed annually by the MAJCOM staff and the measured
   unit commander. Unit commanders must sign the unit DOC Statement upon assumption of command
   or after annual review has been completed. Signature does not acknowledge agreement/disagreement.
   Signature indicates the review has been accomplished and the commander and their designated alter-
   nates understand the SORTS reporting requirements in the DOC Statement. Current SORTS DOC
   Statements must be marked with the last review date and maintained for the duration of the initial
   DOC, i.e., if current DOC’s effective date is 1 Jan 2001, and you have a SAV in Mar 2003, records
   must show the initial review and one annual. All unit commander documentation must be shown for
   the life of the DOC. The MAJCOM/ANG/DRU/FOA SORTS office is responsible for the tracking
   and initiation of annual reviews. When an annual review is conducted, notify HQ USAF SORTS of
   the review date via e-mail or the Automatic Digital Network (AUTODIN)/Defense Message System
   (DMS). When altered or outdated the impacted SORTS DOC Statement must be replaced or
   rescinded, as applicable. The applicable MAJCOM/ANG/DRU/FOA SORTS office will ensure that
   HQ USAF SORTS receives the current SORTS DOC Statement via electronic mail media; (e-mail or
   AUTODIN/DMS) or an automated DOC Statement system.
       1.7.9.1. Unexpected changes to unit DOC Statements must be accomplished within 60 days of
       changes in unit data, i.e., Unit & Mission Identification, Measured Resource areas (personnel,
       equipment, training), or any item that would affect unit reporting requirements. Expected changes
       must be accomplished 30 days prior to the change.
       1.7.9.2. DOC Statement pen and ink changes will only be completed for administrative purposes.
       Administrative changes include DOC effective date, spelling or grammatical errors, etc. All pen
       and ink changes will be originated by the OPR for the DOC Statement and submitted to all agen-
       cies that originally coordinated on the DOC undergoing the change. Any change to DOC content,
       such as Unit data, UTC identification, unit reporting instructions, or other material that effects the
       actual reporting of information requires a new/revised DOC Statement submitted through normal
       coordination channels.
       1.7.9.3. For coordination timelines and detailed instructions on preparing DOC Statements, see
       Attachment 2.

1.8. Single and Multiple SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723 or approved facsimile). N o r m a l l y, a
unit has a single SORTS DOC Statement, called the Primary Mission DOC, which reflects all the unit
assigned/tasked wartime mission(s), including the most stringent contingency mission. The Primary DOC
Statement Overall C-level for a unit is the primary readiness indicator available to the Joint/Air Staffs and
component commanders, and is based on the capability of a unit to accomplish it’s full wartime mission
18                                                         AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


set(s). DOC Statements will not be written to only reflect an AEF steady state commitment; such commit-
ments may be added in the Remarks section at MAJCOM option. See Attachment 2 for details.
     1.8.1. If a unit’s total wartime mission is composed of significantly different component missions
     (mobility, generation, nuclear, conventional, etc.), the parent MAJCOM may elect to produce multi-
     ple SORTS DOC Statements for that unit. Multiple SORTS DOC Statements will be organized as fol-
     lows:
        1.8.1.1. The primary mission SORTS DOC Statement will be assigned DOCNR 1 and will
        encompass all the missions assigned to a unit. There will be only one primary mission SORTS
        DOC Statement.
        1.8.1.2. Any major portion of a unit’s total wartime mission requiring assessment separate and
        apart from the primary mission SORTS DOC Statement is referenced in a secondary mission
        SORTS DOC Statement. Examples include conventional munitions delivery, Operations Plan
        8044 Revision 03, nuclear munitions delivery, mobility, in-place generation, etc.
        1.8.1.3. Ancillary portions of a unit’s total wartime mission that require assessment separate and
        apart from the Primary or Secondary SORTS DOC Statement are referenced in a Tertiary Mission
        SORTS DOC Statement. Examples would be individual UTCs, force protection, operational risk
        management, etc.
        1.8.1.4. Primary DOC Statements will only address a single set of resources listed on a unit’s
        DOC and are limited to only resources authorized to that unit or Direct Support Unit (DSU). A
        unit’s Primary DOC Statement (for SORTS C-level assessment purposes) must not reference
        resources already measured under another unit’s DOC Statement. Two units cannot measure the
        same resources, however, a unit’s Secondary or Tertiary DOC Statement(s) may reference the
        same Primary DOC resources for a secondary mission assessment. This does not constitute double
        counting of resources as this procedure is intended to provide a separate assessment of single mis-
        sions or capabilities.
     1.8.2. Overall C-level data for the Secondary or Tertiary SORTS DOC Statement is reported in the
     Subordinate Overall (SUBOVRAL) set.

1.9. Measuring Unit Resources using DOC Response Time. Air Force units must be ready for deploy-
ment and/or employment within a specified time, referred to as the unit’s DOC response time. Measure-
ment of unit resources is based on the measured resource areas expected to be mission ready by the DOC
response time and the expected Overall C-level at the DOC response time.
1.9. (ACC) Measuring Unit Resources Using DOC Response Time. For ACC active and gained avia-
tion units, the DOC statement response time sources are Volume 3, Part 1, of the Air Force War and
Mobilization Plan (WMP-3, Pt 1). HQ ACC OPR for the WMP is the ACC Force Development Branch
(HQ ACC/A3XF).
     1.9.1. Response Time. Resource status is a calculated forecast of a mission or alert response time of
     up to 72 hours (CJCSM 3150.02). Units with multiple missions and/or response times also apply these
     rules. Multiple response times should be applied accordingly to resources required by each response
     time. SORTS Primary DOC Statements list the shortest of multiple response times that all unit
     resources are expected to be ready or recalled.
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                         19


   1.9.2. Using Response Time. Air Force units project C-level status within their response time. When
   projecting resource status, units will count all resources (as available, that are expected to be ready by
   the response time). Consider the following factors, as a minimum, when projecting unit resource sta-
   tus:
       1.9.2.1. The unit’s actual deployment posture.
       1.9.2.2. The unit can conduct emergency recall of personnel, curtail scheduled maintenance/rou-
       tine training unrelated to deployed posture, and increase work shift length.
       1.9.2.3. The delivery schedules for ordering items from outside agencies will not change from
       current projections.
       1.9.2.4. Allocate resources to units under a parent organization based on the subordinate unit’s
       place in the deployment sequence.

1.10. Category-Levels (C-levels) and Associated Remarks. C-levels reflect the degree to which unit
resources meet prescribed levels of personnel, equipment, and training.
   1.10.1. C-1. The unit possesses the required resources and is trained to undertake the full wartime
   mission(s) for which it is organized or designed. The resource and training area status will neither
   limit flexibility and methods for mission accomplishment nor increase vulnerability of unit personnel
   and equipment. The unit does not require any compensation for any deficiencies.
   1.10.2. C-2. The unit possesses the required resources and is trained to undertake most of the wartime
   mission(s) for which it is organized or designed. The resource and training area status may cause iso-
   lated decreases in flexibility in methods for mission accomplishment, but will not increase the unit's
   vulnerability under most envisioned operational scenarios. The unit would require little, if any, com-
   pensation for deficiencies.
   1.10.3. C-3. The unit possesses the required resources and is trained to undertake many, but not all,
   portions of the wartime mission(s) for which it is organized or designed. The resource and training
   area status will result in significant decrease in flexibility for mission accomplishment and will
   increase vulnerability of the unit under many, but not all, envisioned operational scenarios. The unit
   would require significant compensation for deficiencies.
   1.10.4. C-4. The unit requires additional resources or training to undertake its wartime mission(s),
   but it may be directed to undertake portions of its wartime mission(s) with resources O/H.
   1.10.5. C-5. The unit is undergoing a Service-directed resource action and is not prepared, at this
   time, to undertake the mission set for which it is organized or designed. Within the CBDRT report,
   units will use C-5 to indicate when they have no NBC defense equipment or training requirements,
   See Attachment 4.
   1.10.6. C-6. The unit is not required to measure assets in a specified area. C-6 (not a rating) may not
   be used as an Overall C-level.
   1.10.6. (ACC) Ensure reason code(s) are submitted for each area (i.e., PNM, SNM, RNM, TNM)
   when reporting this status level.
   1.10.7. Overall C-level. Only the commander, or officially designated representative, of the measured
   unit is authorized to assign an Overall C-level. Commanders may not modify calculated resource area
   category levels, but are expected to use judgment in the commander’s assessment and to raise or lower
20                                                             AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


     the overall category level when appropriate. Higher echelons of command may add remarks to a unit’s
     SORTS report to further explain a situation or deficiency but may not change subordinate unit C-lev-
     els.
     1.10.7. (ACC) Commanders above the measured unit may review the report and add narrative
     remarks; however, the report must not be delayed.
     1.10.8. Assigning the Overall C-level. Based on unit readiness, unit commanders assign the Overall
     C-level each time it is reported. Normally, the lowest level of the four measured resource areas is
     reported as the Overall C-level provided it is a realistic indication of the unit’s readiness (based on the
     C-level definitions). As a reminder, the measured area data cannot be arbitrarily changed from calcu-
     lated values (must be reported per the specified formulas and tables). If the lowest measured area level
     is not a realistic indication of the unit’s Overall C-level, commanders can assess the Overall C-level to
     a level that better indicates unit readiness. Commanders are expected to use their judgment during
     assessments and may raise or lower the overall C-level. At a minimum, commanders should consider
     the following factors when determining the overall unit C-level: inspection results, assistance team
     results, program readiness reviews, and the number of critical personnel in support of Small Scale
     Contingencies (SSC) deployments. Units attaining an Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI) or
     Nuclear Surety Inspection (NSI) Marginal or Unsatisfactory inspection result will consider lowering
     the Overall C-level and providing remarks outlining deficiencies and resource improvement timeta-
     bles. The remarks should reflect training requirements and/or resource actions necessary to satisfacto-
     rily accomplish the inspection and anticipated completion dates. The commander will provide
     rationale for any assessment in a remark using the Overall Reason Organization not C-1 (REASN)
     label. The following factors should also be considered:
     1.10.8. (ACC) For overall subjective C-leveling, a measured unit commander may use all ACC
     resources within a unit or wing not already SORTS reported if those resources will be available to the
     measured unit for wartime use. Resources belonging to another unit will not be counted in measured
     resource areas. Resources used in a subjective overall C-level by a unit may not be used for the same
     purpose by another unit.
        1.10.8.1. Personnel subjective factors:
            1.10.8.1.1. Availability of personnel who do not have the required Air Force specialty code
            (AFSC) or skill level but are able to accomplish mission tasks.
            1.10.8.1.2. Unusually high/low formal education level, morale, or unit cohesion.
            1.10.8.1.3. Personnel turnover rates that impact mission accomplishment.
                1.10.8.1.3.1. (Added-ACC) Personnel assigned within the wing or group, who are not
                SORTS measured (e.g., wing staff), can be used for measured unit's commander assess-
                ment under the following conditions: these personnel are not currently measured (reported
                within their unit's report), these personnel must be fully trained in the measured unit's mis-
                sion and be available to the assessing commander within the units DOC response time,
                these personnel are only used for the commanders assessment, they cannot be included in
                the measured unit's training area data, two units cannot simultaneously report the same
                individual. The wing/group will establish procedures to ensure all personnel comply with
                the guidelines within AFI 10-201 and this supplement.
            1.10.8.1.4. Availability of contractors to provide services in support of generation mission.
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                    21


     1.10.8.2. Equipment and Supplies O/H subjective factors:
        1.10.8.2.1. Item shortages having a larger effect than indicated by equipment fill rate.
        1.10.8.2.2. Availability of older items able to substitute functionally and inter-operate with
        required items.
        1.10.8.2.3. Status of plans to move resources from temporary peacetime locations, to wartime
        locations.
        1.10.8.2.4. Differences between standard fill rates and various assessment tools.
        1.10.8.2.5. Individual protective equipment items availability (e.g., mobility bags).
        1.10.8.2.6. The availability of special equipment that may be used to increase the chance for
        success under adverse conditions or add flexibility to mission accomplishment.
     1.10.8.3. Equipment Condition subjective factors:
        1.10.8.3.1. Demonstrated maintenance surge capabilities during exercises, inspections, or
        operations.
        1.10.8.3.2. Depot programmed and unscheduled maintenance status probability.
        1.10.8.3.3. Status of modification programs and their impact on daily operations.
        1.10.8.3.4. Mission Ready rates.
     1.10.8.4. Training subjective factors:
        1.10.8.4.1. Availability of qualified training personnel (rated and non-rated), of equipment
        and/or facilities, and of areas, ranges, and flying hours.
        1.10.8.4.2. Major training event time lapses or a high turnover of key personnel.
        1.10.8.4.3. Completion of any specialized training that increases the chances for mission
        accomplishment.
     1.10.8.5. Other subjective factors:
        1.10.8.5.1. The unit’s ability to operate in a nuclear, biological, and chemical environment,
        see CBDRT.
        1.10.8.5.2. Another unit’s C-level when also required for a specific mission.
        1.10.8.5.3. Host or tenant mission requirements.
        1.10.8.5.4. Ability of contractors to provide contingency or wartime services.
            1.10.8.5.4.1. (Added-ACC) Consider past contractor performance, projected (future)
            contractor performance, the political situation in the host country and the Status of Forces
            Agreements (SOFA) with the host country.
            1.10.8.5.4.2. (Added-ACC) DOD civilians who are members of the ANG or AFRC
            should be considered as non-available.
        1.10.8.5.5. Ability of unit assigned foreign nationals to perform assigned wartime tasks dur-
        ing contingencies or wartime.
22                                                         AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


     1.10.9. Assigning C-5 as the Overall C-level. A parent MAJCOM may authorize use of C-5 for units
     undergoing a service-directed resource action and which are not prepared to undertake the mission set
     for which they are organized or designed. C-5 cannot be reported in any measured resource area and
     C-5 status will not exceed one year for Active Duty or three years for Guard/Reserve units from the
     designated start date of the conversion or transition. C-5 is only used when authorized by the parent
     MAJCOM and one of the following conditions exists:
     1.10.9. (ACC) Assigning C-5 as the Overall C-level. HQ ACC/A3XR will provide SROs with a mes-
     sage indicating the period for the specified unit to report C-5. This message is coordinated through
     HQ ACC/A3XR and the functional manager with approval from the Directorate. ACC units will
     report C-5 only after receiving written authorization from the DOC statement approval authority and
     meeting the C-5 criteria in AFI 10-201.
        1.10.9.1. Unit Transition. Unit transitions include modernization/conversion of major equipment
        (F-4s to F-16s), modernization/upgrade of software in major equipment (extensive equipment
        testing/personnel user training), a change in a unit’s mission (which can be accomplished without
        changing the major equipment involved), and/or a change in a unit’s home station location (higher
        headquarters approval may be required). When a unit is undergoing a transition and the first mea-
        sured area C-level falls to C-4, C-5 may be authorized. Report C-5 as the Overall C-level and
        report the current measured area C-levels until the old DOC is rescinded and the new DOC is
        effective. Units will continue to report their Overall C-level as C-5 until all measured areas
        (except areas authorized to report C-6) have improved to C-3. SORTS reports and DOC State-
        ments are based on the wartime mission(s) for which the unit is organized or designed. Unit tran-
        sitions are not wartime missions. Therefore, separate DOC Statements will not be written for
        transitions.
        1.10.9.1. (ACC) Units undergoing a major equipment conversion report against their current
        DOC statement until in receipt of a new DOC statement reflecting the new equipment. Functional
        Area Managers (FAM) will provide a new DOC statement to the unit no later than midway
        through the equipment conversion phase.
        1.10.9.2. Unit Activation or Re-activation. Activating units may be authorized to report C-5 as
        their Overall C-level until all measured areas have reached a maintainable C-3 (except measured
        areas authorized to be reported as Code 6) or the end of the designated activation period, which-
        ever occurs first.
        1.10.9.2. (ACC) Activating Units. Units are required to begin reporting within 72 hours. DOC
        statements must be provided to these units as soon as possible.
        1.10.9.3. Unit Deactivation. Deactivating units will continue to report SORTS measured areas
        based on their current DOC Statement. Units may be authorized to report C-5 after the first mea-
        sured area reaches C-4. Units must continue to report SORTS until unit deactivation is authorized
        by the publication of a command order (G-Series) at which time the SORTS DOC Statement(s) is/
        are rescinded. Once a unit has deactivated, MAJCOMs will ensure all pertinent unit data is
        removed from the database. Necessary actions must also be undertaken to remove the unit from
        tasking documents (OPLANs, CONPLANS, service war planning documents such as the
        AFWUS, etc.).
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                   23


      1.10.9.3. (ACC) Forecast C-4 with the deactivation date as the forecast date when reporting C-5
      overall. HQ ACC/A3XR will remove the unit from SORTS BIDE (GSORTS database) no later
      than the inactivation date.
      1.10.9.4. Units not manned or equipped but required in wartime force structure. HQ USAF
      SORTS will determine what data will be reported for any units of this type.
      1.10.9.5. Units authorized to report C-5 will continue to compute and report measured area C-lev-
      els at least monthly unless directed to do so more frequently by the parent MAJCOM.
   1.10.10. Explaining the Overall C-level. Remarks will be used to explain and amplify data contained
   in a SORTS report. All remarks must be written in plain English and clearly explain why the unit is
   less than C-1, what actions are being taken to resolve the problem, what resources are needed, and
   when the C-level will change. Acronyms may only be used if previously defined in the remark in
   which that acronym is being used. See Chapter Two for further direction.

         SORTS data handling procedures.
         1.11.3.1.2. Commanders identify a SORTS DOC Statement Approval Authority, establish an
         adequately manned SORTS office, and assign functional area responsibilities for each mea-
         sured unit type reporting in SORTS.
         1.11.3.1.2. (ACC) COMACC has appointed ACC directors as DOC statement approval
         authorities for units within their functional areas. They are also appointed as the senior coordi-
         nator for ACC-gained unit DOC statements in their functional area.
     1.11.3.2. SORTS DOC Statement Approval Authority:
         1.11.3.2.1. The MAJCOM SORTS DOC Statement Approval Authority ensures draft SORTS

     1.11.7. (ACC) MAJCOM Personnel Office: The ACC Airman Development Division (HQ ACC/
     A1F) performs these functions.
        1.11.7.1. MAJCOM/DPXO function notifies MAJCOM/DP within one duty day when a unit’s
        P-level is P-3/4 or C-3/4 due to Personnel shortages. MAJCOM/DP monitors the unit's P-level or
        C-level (when commander assessed due to personnel) until the unit returns above P-2 or C-2.
        1.11.7.2. MAJCOM/DP provides FAMs, upon request, a personnel assessment of AFSC short-
        ages to include validating manning levels (authorized, assigned, required, available).
        1.11.7.3. Provides a Personnel assessment of each shortage AFSC to include validated manning

     DOC Statement deliberate planning information.
     1.11.8. (ACC) MAJCOM Employment/Deployment Planner: HQ ACC/A3XF and the FAMs per-
     form these functions.
        1.11.8.1. Ensure accuracy of listed WMP-5 sortie factors, WMP-3, Pt 1 response times (i.e.,
        availability date), UTCs and RSP authorizations for aviation forces and verify accuracy of section
        II E listed OPLANs/CONPLANs tasking(s) for all units.
        1.11.8.1. (ACC) Validates the accuracy of plans listed on DOC statements, WMP planning fac-
        tors (UTC quantities, sortie, rates, response times, etc.), and provides inputs to the FAMs as
        required.
        1.11.8.2. Ensure the "UTCs Required to Support" section of DOC Statements includes all UTCs
        per paragraph A2.8.2.3. and sub-paragraphs, as applicable, i.e., as a minimum, ensure applicable
        AFWUS UTC records are listed in section IIC.
        1.11.8.2. (ACC) Ensures DOC statement listed UTCs are aligned with unit UTC availability pro-
        vided by the FAM and documented in the ACC extract of the Air Force Wide-UTC Availability
        System (UTC Availability Listing). The ACC UTC Availability Listing extract is managed by HQ
        ACC/A3XA and is the ACC active duty portion of the UTC Availability Listing, which is part of
        the Air Force War and Mobilization Planning (WMP) System. Documentation of UTC availability
        in the WMP system is valid wartime tasking for worldwide contingencies regardless of whether or
        not a unit is sourced with a particular UTC in a deliberate plan. Unit UTC availability, provided by
        the staff FAM and documented in the UTC Availability Listing extract, constitutes tasking. Units
        should be manned, trained and equipped to maintain the tasked capability. Therefore, unit UTC
        availability documented in the ACC UTC Availability Listing extract is the basis for DOC state-
        ment listed UTCs.
     1.11.9. Intermediate Headquarters - Numbered Air Forces (NAF): Normally, organizations between
     MAJCOM and wing/base don’t have a direct SORTS role unless acting as the AF component to a uni-
     fied command. However, MAJCOMs may assign SORTS responsibilities to NAFs. As a component
     headquarters during contingencies NAFs will:
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                       31

        stances, and/or situations impacting the measured resource areas.
        1.11.10.1.2. Establish procedures to ensure the reports, that are required to reach the joint
        database within 24 hours, are not delayed. See paragraph 2.4. The 24 hour clock begins the
        moment the resource or training status changed and ends when the report is posted in the joint
        master SORTS database in the Pentagon.
        1.11.10.1.3. Ensure appointment, SORTS data handling training, and training documentation
        of two or more Wing/Base SRO SORTS managers (normally 1C3X1 Command Post Journey-
        men, at least one 7-level is highly recommended) to ensure uninterrupted reporting during
        both peacetime and contingencies regardless of unit temporary duty (TDY) and leave activi-
        ties.
        1.11.10.1.3. (ACC) Wing SORTS managers and alternates are required to attend the ACC
        SORTS/Reports Manager Course. The optimum time to attend is before assuming SORTS
        manager and alternate duties. If this is not possible, attendance will be as soon as possible after
        assuming duties. The course is not limited to those assuming SORTS manager duties, Com-
        mand Post chiefs and superintendents are also encouraged to attend.
        1.11.10.1.4. (Added-ACC) Each wing SORTS manager will write a supplement to establish
        local procedures for implementing the requirements of AFI 10-201 and this supplement.

        1.11.10.2.4.1. (ACC) Receive and distribute SORTS DOC statements to all agencies with
        a valid need-to-know. Obtain the measured unit commander's signature/date on DOC
        statements (Section V, unit commander review) and distribute. Ensure new commanders
        sign and date the DOC statement within 30 days of assuming command. The wing SRO
        will maintain original signed DOC statements, and the unit SORTS monitors will maintain
        a copy.
        1.11.10.2.4.2. Provide assistance in resolving SORTS DOC Statement discrepancies.
     1.11.10.2.5. Provide technical assistance to measured units.

   separately. Counters will not be restarted for fiscal or calendar years.
       1.13.1.1. When SROs are transmitting single, multiple-part, SORTS messages, the counter
       should be bumped forward to allow the next report in the series to process to avoid unnecessary
       delays.
       1.13.1.2. Only Air Staff or MAJCOM SORTS agencies may request Defense Information Sys-
       tems Agency (DISA) bump the GSORTS message processor counter. DISA will coordinate with
       appropriate headquarters prior to making the change. Any additional notifications will be made, as
       required.
   1.13.2. When units are experiencing difficulties with their message sequence numbers, CROs, may
   use the GSORTS OVERRIDE feature to override the normal sequencing of message traffic. Users are
   responsible for the consequences of overriding.
       1.13.2.1. OVERRIDE message numbering will be sequential (e.g., 001Y, 002Y, 003Y).
       Non-sequential OVERRIDE reporting is not authorized under any circumstance.
       1.13.2.2. Units choosing to use OVERRIDE message sequencing will take immediate corrective
       action on any errors that occur as a result of out of sequence message processing.

NOTES:
          1. The above guidance applies if no other classification authority requires a higher classifica-
             tion.
          2. Unit identification information considered classified may require same classification for
             personnel data.
          3. Entries constitute Air Force classification guidance.

               REPORTING CATEGORY LEVEL (C-LEVEL) DATA ELEMENTS

Section 2A—Measured Categories and General Rules

2.1. General Resource Relationship to Unit Combat Preparedness. C-levels are developed by the JS
and derived through quantitative criteria to define in qualitative terms, the degree to which a measured
unit is capable of performing the wartime mission(s) for which it was organized and designed. C-levels
provide clarity of resource status to advise the Secretary of Defense, unified commands, and the Services
on current force readiness.
   2.1.1. C-levels collectively represent, via a five point scale, the degree to which a unit meets stan-
   dards established within four measured resource areas: 1) personnel, 2) training, 3) equipment and
   supplies O/H, and 4) equipment condition, plus an Overall C-level assigned by the measured unit
   commander.
   2.1.2. While the JCS require only the Overall and measured area C-levels, the AF requires units to
   report actual raw data percentages in each measured area. This gives a crisis decision-maker and
   resource or training manager more detailed status than the C-levels alone indicate.

2.2. When To Use This Chapter. Command echelons, above measured units, use this chapter to ensure
C-level data is relayed without change or delay and to comment on its content when appropriate. Mea-
sured units and below will use chapter sections as follows:
   2.2.1. Section 2A. Used to calculate values for C-level data elements and gather data for the prepara-
   tion/transmission of properly formatted SORTS reports.
   2.2.2. Section 2B. Used to gather source document data (see paragraph 2.9. and Table 2.2.), identify
   Limiting Factor(s) (LIMFAC), formulate detailed narratives and forecast changes in Overall C-levels,
   and verify correct reporting of narrative remarks.
   2.2.3. Section 2C. Used to report AF SPECAP data.

2.3. General Policy for C-level Calculations
   2.3.1. CJCS policy requires all Active, ANG, and AF Reserve operating force and provisional com-
   bat, combat support, and combat service support units apportioned to or deployed in support of an
   OPLAN, CONPLAN, OPERATIONS PLAN 8044 REVISION 03, or service war planning docu-
   ments, e.g. WMP and AFWUS, be designated as SORTS reporting measured units. Unit types listed
   in Attachment 2, Table A2.1. through A2.4., are required to report SORTS. Additional unit types
   identified are necessary for crisis planning whether or not those units are currently tasked in plans.
   The following policy guidelines apply to all reporting units:
       2.3.1.1. Two units will not count the same resource as available.
       2.3.1.2. A unit’s Overall C-level will be based only on the resources and training organic
       (assigned, allocated, or direct support) to it or its parent unit. Mobile or transportable communica-
       tions units may include those resources on loan that can be re-deployed within the reported unit’s
       SORTS DOC Statement response time.
46                                                           AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


        2.3.1.3. Units calculate and report area levels (P, S, R, and T) for all four measured resource areas
        unless exempted by Table 2.1. Use only published objective criteria for measurement. Do not sub-
        jectively raise or lower measured resource area levels.
        2.3.1.4. Only measured unit commanders, or their designated alternates, can assign the unit’s
        Overall C-level. Unless factors like those listed in Chapter 1, paragraph 1.10.8., warrant a level
        change, report the lowest of the four measured levels as the Overall C-level.
        2.3.1.5. Command echelons, above the measured unit, will not change any reported levels or
        delay the submission of a report. The command echelon may submit additional remarks to com-
        ment on reported levels or describe assistance actions.
        2.3.1.6. Units not reporting a C-1 in all areas must clearly indicate the reason(s). Refer to Section
        2B, paragraph 2.11., for specific remark content requirements.

2.4. Frequency of Reporting C-level Data Elements. CJCS policy requires unit C-level changes to
reach the National Military Command Center (NMCC) within 24 hours after a reportable event or upon
direction of the CJCS, the Services, or CRO. GSORTS is the readiness reporting system for the NMCC.
AF units will report C-level changes within 24 hours of the change for each SORTS DOC Statement.
Report when there are changes in the Overall C-level, Overall Reason Code, measured area levels, mea-
sured area reason codes, PCTEF, D, E, F, and G reason codes (DEFG), GWD updates, forecast dates, or
when directed by the measured unit commander. If a unit is committed to combat operations (i.e., located
in a combat zone), report C-level data as described above or at the frequency and level of detail as directed
by the CJCS.
     2.4.1. SORTS measured units will verify and update data elements listed in this chapter every 28-30
     days or more frequently if specifically directed. Unless otherwise authorized by HQ USAF SORTS,
     databases will never be older than 31 days from the last report based on the RICDA date. Units and/
     or their designated SROs must ensure that submitted reports process. Units will verify GSORTS data-
     base accuracy via receiving error-free RAMP and subsequent SORTS Database Review messages.
     Units will compare reports submitted against their database reviews (or equivalent products), and
     ensure that non-receipt of a RAMP or review within 72 hours (since time of report transmittal) is
     reported to the CRO for assistance. Units and/or SROs failing to meet listed timing criteria are in
     direct violation of AFI 10-201 and CJCSM 3150.02.
     2.4.1. (ACC) HQ ACC/A3XR will send a weekly message will be sent to SROs notifying ACC units
     with a RICDA and/or CADAT date older than 30 days. Wing SROs will ensure delinquent reports are
     updated within 24 hours.
        2.4.1.1. Units will continue to report SORTS when TDY for training, when deployed (e.g., Red
        Flag, natural disaster, crisis, OPORD, Deployment Order (DEPORD), Expeditionary Aerospace
        Force/Air Expeditionary Force (EAF/AEF), etc.), or when involved in local training (base phase
        exercises, inspections, etc.).
        2.4.1.2. Secondary and Tertiary Mission data will be reported using the same timelines as Pri-
        mary Mission data.
     2.4.2. Submit data to the appropriate labels in AFSORTSDET and a new report date in the RICDA
     field (Primary Mission) or Date of Change of Subarea Category Information (RICDF) (Secondary or
     Tertiary Missions). Composite/aggregate unit reports must be received within 96 hours of the oldest
     individual unit report RICDA.
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                         47


   2.4.3. Report major equipment relocation(s) using the MEQLOCN set upon partial unit deployment
   or unit relocation. The reporting of all fields of the MEQLOCN set pertaining to operational ready sta-
   tus of aircraft and mission-ready status of crews will reflect the resources available within the applica-
   ble response times. See Attachment five for further guidance.
   2.4.4. CROs will report changes in unit location.
   2.4.5. CROs will submit waiver requests for reporting requirements or changes to reporting fre-
   quency through HQ USAF SORTS to the JS. Units submit their waiver requests through their respec-
   tive MAJCOM FAM to the CRO.
   2.4.6. If there is no change to a unit’s status since their last report and a new report is due, show that
   data has been reviewed and is current by submitting a report consisting of the unit’s AFSORTSDET
   Overall Page with the RICDA and all remarks reflecting an updated date.
   2.4.7. INFO address all AUTODIN/DMS reports to “HQ USAF SORTS REPORTS WASHINGTON
   DC//.” There is no requirement to submit an info copy when using File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to
   deliver messages to the GSORTS processor.
   2.4.8. CJCS policy allows assignment of overall status as of the report time or projection of status
   within the response time of up to 72 hours. Air Force units will report expected C-level status within
   the SORTS DOC Statement response time. The SORTS report will reflect the resources that are
   expected to be available within the DOC response time. Units can assume the following:
       2.4.8.1. The unit is in its actual deployed posture as dictated by current situation and existing JCS
       tasking orders. If committed to a smaller scale contingency, units may be released to refit and
       re-deploy to fill their full wartime mission set. Generally, units consider deployed resources to be
       available for their full wartime mission set (see para 2.8.).
       2.4.8.2. The unit can conduct emergency recall of personnel, curtail scheduled maintenance/rou-
       tine training unrelated to deployed posture, and increase work shift length.
       2.4.8.3. The delivery schedules for ordering items from outside agencies will not change from
       current projections.

2.5. Forecasting Overall C-level Changes. Use this set whenever the Overall C-level is not a “1”, is an
assessed Overall C-level (C-1X), a C-level change is predicted, or when the Forecast Date of Change
(CADAT) expires. If concrete indications of an impending change in the unit’s Overall C-level exist,
forecast what C-level the unit will change to (up or down) and the date the unit will change C-levels. Units
coordinate with their MAJCOMS for any assistance needed.
   2.5.1. When a unit forecasts a change in its C-level, the unit must report both the Forecast Change
   Rating (CARAT) for Primary DOCs and the Forecast Subarea Change Rating (CARAF) for Second-
   ary or Tertiary DOCs. Units must also report the estimated CADAT (Primary) and the Forecast Sub-
   area Date of Change (CADAF) (Secondary or Tertiary). When a unit reports degraded C-levels and it
   is unable to forecast a change date, the responsible MAJCOM must provide the unit assistance to
   determine a best estimate forecast for insertion into the SORTS report. Forecasts are not required for
   units reporting C-1 that expect no change. If the reporting unit commander assesses the Overall
   C-level up to C-1X, the reporting unit must also report a CARAT and CADAT. The CARAT and
   CADAT fields must be updated every time a SORTS report is submitted
48                                                            AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


     2.5.2. Forecast Remark. In addition to the CARAT and CADAT field information, a minimum of
     once every 30 days, unit commanders will provide a C-level forecast at 3, 6, and 12 months in a
     remark under the CADAT label. The remark will forecast the C-level at 3, 6, and 12-month points in
     time reflecting same number of forecasted days added to the RICDA date of the report. Fill in the
     AFSORTSDET Overall SORTS page following the example format below:
        2.5.2.1. Format the C-level forecasts as:
(date) 3 MONTH FORECAST/2/P/P06/PERSONNEL PERMANENT CHANGE OF
STATION (PCS) WITH NO REPLACEMENTS TRAINED
6 MONTH FORECAST/1/NO EXPECTED PROBLEMS
12 MONTH FORECAST/1/NO EXPECTED PROBLEMS
        2.5.2.2. Units desiring to report additional dates or information concerning forecasts may do so
        using a free-text remark. Remarks of this type are in addition to forecast comments and may be
        added immediately following the 12-month CADAT remark or by selecting the CADAT label
        from the remarks listing.

2.6. Limiting Factor(s) (LIMFAC). Within the scope of SORTS reporting, remarks must be created to
address any LIMFAC (unit problem) that affects the unit’s ability to accomplish its wartime mission. A
LIMFAC is a problem, deficiency, or condition that decreases or prevents a unit from accomplishing its
wartime mission, and which usually requires assistance from higher headquarters to resolve. Issues of
LIMFAC will be reported under the Current Overall Category Level (READY) label. In addition to the
READY remark, some LIMFAC may require that they be reported using a remark label for the SORTS
area affected and considered when assigning unit C-levels (SORTS LIMFAC). SORTS LIMFAC may be
reflected in the four measured resource area C-levels, but may be reported throughout a unit’s SORTS
report. Examples of SORTS LIMFAC include; critical AFSC and equipment shortages, problems with
aircrew training, personnel experience levels, Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSP) and In-Place
Readiness Spares Package (IRSP) pacing item shortages, etc.
     2.6.1. Units experiencing a LIMFAC that they feel is not reportable in SORTS but requires higher
     headquarters direction will report in accordance with MAJCOM directives.
     2.6.2. LIMFAC impacting the unit’s ability to accomplish its mission(s) are classified at the level of
     the information contained per applicable directives. If no other directive governs the classification, the
     SORTS classification guidance applies.

2.7. Use of the Percent Effective (PCTEF) Field.
PCTEF provides a subjective assessment of the unit’s ability to execute its currently assigned nontradi-
tional mission. When employed in support of a nontraditional mission, commanders will report PCTEF.
PCTEF reporting is required upon receipt of an order to execute any of the following missions: Homeland
Defense or Homeland Security missions in support of USNORTHCOM and USPACOM (including quick
reaction force and/or ready reaction force missions), peacekeeeping or peace enforcement operations,
humanitarian assistance, consequence management, counterdrug operations, civil distrubance operations,
and natural disaster relief operations (including wildfire fighting missions). In some cases, a unit execut-
ing assigned nontraditional operation will be executing its wartime tasks in support of that nontraditional
mission (e.g., a Civil Engineering unit providing support to a natural disaster relief operation). In those
cases, commanders will use their discretion to determine if PCTEF reporting is required.
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                        49


2.7. (ACC) Use of the Percent Effective (PCTEF) Field. When a unit has more than one nontraditional
mission, in addition to reporting the lowest assessed mission will also add in their PCTEF remarks infor-
mation regarding all other PCTEF missions assigned.
   2.7.1. PCTEF will not necessarily correlate with a unit’s Overall C-level. For example, if the unit is
   currently assigned a nontraditional mission, PCTEF will capture the commander’s assessment against
   this nontraditional mission while the Overall C-level will continue to assess the unit’s ability to exe-
   cute its full wartime tasking(s). To report the impact on a unit’s C-level from deployed resources,
   commanders needs to use DEFG (see paragraph 2.8.).
   2.7.2. When conditions for reporting PCTEF exist, home station units (SORTS reporting units only),
   who own the deployed resource(s) will begin reporting PCTEF upon assignment of a mission and
   issuance of a deployment warning order. Regardless of order receipt, PCTEF reporting commences no
   later than the deployment date and continues until unit mission requirements are changed or no longer
   exist.
       2.7.2.1. Units with multiple tasked or assigned deployment missions will reflect PCTEF ratings
       of the lowest assessed mission accompanied by the unit commander's remarks.
       2.7.2.2. Units will not report individual (single person) deployment tasking in PCTEF.
       2.7.2.3. Use the following definitions to report the commander’s estimate of unit ability to under-
       take one or more assigned missions for which the unit must deploy:
           2.7.2.3.1. Report a PCTEF level of 1 ('1' in PCTEF field) if the unit possesses the required
           resources and is trained to undertake the full mission(s) assigned.
           2.7.2.3.2. Report a PCTEF level of 2 ('2' in PCTEF field) if the unit possesses the required
           resources and is trained to undertake most of the mission(s) assigned.
           2.7.2.3.3. Report a PCTEF level of 3 ('3' in PCTEF field) if the unit possesses the required
           resources and is trained to undertake many, but not all portions of the mission(s) assigned mis-
           sion.
           2.7.2.3.4. Report a PCTEF level of 4 ('4' in PCTEF field) if the unit requires additional
           resources or training to undertake the current mission(s) assigned. It may be directed to under-
           take portions of the current assigned mission with resources O/H.
           2.7.2.3.5. When no other requirement exists to report data in this field enter a question mark
           "?" to completely remove a previously reported entry.
   2.7.3. Commander’s remarks are mandatory when reporting in the PCTEF field. Using plain text
   under the PCTEF label, identify the mission assigned (e.g., Tsunami Relief Operations.) current sta-
   tus, and/or any action underway or planned to remedy a current reduced readiness condition for
   assigned missions. Format the PCTEF remark according to the example below:
Percent Effective (2), Tsunami Relief Operations, status reflects reduced/increased effectiveness due to
reason(s), e.g., Tsunami Relief Operations deployment tasking cannot be fully supported due to shortage
of (personnel, equipment and supplies o/h, equipment condition, and/or training). To alleviate the situa-
tion on (area), the unit will (action). Get well date (gwd) is estimated to be (date). Estimated departure/
return date is (date).

2.8. Policy for Units with Deployed Resources. When assets of a measured unit are deployed (partially
deployed), the parent unit will normally report status on these resources in its C-level.
     2.8.1. When part of a unit is deployed in support of an operation you may count resources as available
     under the following conditions:
        2.8.1.1. For units with mobility only or a dual, in-place generation and mobility mission(s): if
        they are capable of being ready to redeploy from their current location within the DOC response
        time.
        2.8.1.2. For units with an in-place generation mission: if they are capable of redeploying to their
        home station and generating within response time. Generally units with in-place generation mis-
        sions will not be able to redeploy to home station and generate within their response time.
        2.8.1.3. Regardless of gaining or losing resources, if the unit reports less than C-1, enter the rea-
        son under the SECRN label and use remarks to emphasize increase or reduction in required and
        assigned resources because of deployment to build up or augment resources. When resources par-
        tially deployed are counted as available (could be redeployed within response time), see the
        expanded reason codes in Table 2.6.
        2.8.1.4. Expanded reason codes D, E, F, or G (DEFG) will be used to reflect the commander’s
        assessment of the percent of unit deployable capability that is currently deployed. This informa-
        tion is used to assess risk of resources not being made available to redeploy. Refer to Table 2.6. for
        an explanation of these expanded reason codes.
        2.8.1.5. Supported CCs require readiness information specific to a unit’s ability to meet employ-
        ment tasking. Therefore, MAJCOMs must ensure their deployed units meet the supported com-
        manders’ information needs through utilization of unit commander assessments of PCTEF.
     2.8.2. HQ USAF/XOOA, in coordination with the JS, will decide, on a case-by-case basis, the extent
     of reporting for units deployed to operate; in a stand-alone capacity; as a temporary or provisional
     unit; and units which transfer, loan, or supplement personnel or supplies (e.g., resources turned in to
     personnel or supply system) from several units to form a temporary or provisional unit.

2.11. Preparing Narrative Remarks. Remarks are a critical component of SORTS and are required
whenever a measured resource subarea percentage drives a measured area level less than 1, i.e., P-1 (Per-
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                       53


sonnel), S-1 (Equipment), R-1 (Equipment Condition) or T-1 (Training)/(See Table 2.4., Remarks Guid-
ance Matrix). Remarks will progressively highlight problem areas for each individual label regardless of
whether the reported percentage is the actual driver of the measured area level, e.g., a unit has equipment
and supplies problems in ESSA3 and equipment condition problems reported in ERSA2 and ERSA4.
First an individual remark will be written for each one of these labels. Then a remark, in some cases the
same, will be listed in the next higher label of both areas. IAW the above that would be the ESRES and
ERRES labels. For the ESRES the same ESSA3 remark will be used. For the ERRES a combination of the
ERSA2 and ERSA4 labels will be added. Lastly, a compilation of all the labels remarked on (ESSA3,
ERSA2, ERSA4, ESRES, and ERRES) will be given in the REASN label. Remarks will be written in con-
junction with the following:
   2.11.1. Use remarks to give supplemental information concerning unit Overall C-level, or measured
   area level, and SORTS LIMFAC. Remarks must be checked and verified for accuracy each time any
   portion of a report is submitted. Revise content and remark date as necessary to maintain validity.
   Remove remarks that no longer apply. If no change in content, revise the remark date to prevent it
   from exceeding 30 days from the last revision or when a full report or a partial report that contains
   remarks is submitted. Remarks will never be more than 31 days old.
   2.11.2. As previously described, progressively report on each label requiring a remark. SORTS cus-
   tomers often selectively retrieve specific pieces of data from the database and need to know the loca-
   tion of the remark that explains the data they retrieve. Write remarks in plain English. Acronyms must
   be defined in each remark area in which it is used. Additional uses of a defined acronym in the same
   remark may reflect only the acronym. As SORTS is dynamic and remarks may change from report to
   report, do not refer to previous message numbers. Do not submit remarks referencing other remarks
   (e.g. See REASN remark), each remark must stand on its own content or it will defeat the specific data
   retrieval programs. In general, list resource types with their problems. State numbers required,
   assigned, and available, explain the cause of the problem, if known, identify previously requested
   assistance and remedial actions in progress, highlight further actions required, and supply a date of
   expected change for better or worse (see 2.11.5. for GWD specifics).
   2.11.3. Remarks must contain a layperson’s explanation of the problem and its mission impact for
   customers to understand the unit's situation. Remarks must also contain a detailed functional explana-
   tion of the situation to provide details needed for functional management.
   2.11.4. Explain unit and wing actions taken to resolve shortcomings. State if, and what kind of, higher
   headquarters action is needed.
   2.11.5. Provide a realistic GWD for each shortfall or problem in each remark. Use the day, month and
   year (DDMMMYY) date format, i.e. 01JAN02. If GWD is Unknown, contact the applicable MAJ-
   COM FAM for assistance in establishing a GWD.
   2.11.6. Remarks should be clear and concise, but not at the expense of the details needed. Each
   remark can be up to 5000 characters long.
   2.11.7. For the Personnel area, explain the following areas:
       2.11.7.1. Write a remark using the PRRES label (Primary Reason Measured Resource Subarea
       Level for Personnel Not C-1 (PRREF) for Secondary or Tertiary Missions) to discuss the person-
       nel area when less then P-1.
54                                                           AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


        2.11.7.2. When directed to include DoD civilian employees (contractors will not be measured) in
        P-level measurements, report total and critical numbers authorized, assigned, and available in a
        remark using the PRRES label. When commander-assessing the Overall C-level, if the availability
        of any non-measured contract personnel or assigned DoD personnel are used to support that
        assessment, factor in the non-availability of those who are obligated to the reserve components
        during crisis or wartime. Describe the services they would have provided in a remark using the
        PRRES label. Contract employee availability due to labor action or failure to perform impacting
        mission should also be explained in detail.
        2.11.7.3. UTC/UMD mismatches exist when one or more of the following conditions occur: UTC
        requirements exceed UMD authorizations or UTC skill and/or grades cannot be matched after all
        authorized substitutions have been considered. When UTC/UMD mismatches reflect a shortage in
        any AFSC, identify shortfalls in a remark in the PRRAT label by listing each involved; UTC,
        AFSC, number of personnel required by UTC, and number of personnel authorized by UMD. To
        identify shortfalls, compare the most current UTC as indicated on the SORTS DOC Statement
        with the most current UMD authorizations. Compare these documents for mismatches. A compar-
        ison report is available through the Wing Manpower Office upon request. In the event of UTC/
        UMD mismatches, see paragraph 3.6.1. for measurement calculation requirements.
        2.11.7.4. Regardless of P-level, if personnel shortages exist, identify them in a remark using the
        PERTP label by listing each involved; AFSC, number of personnel authorized or required,
        assigned, available, in upgrade training (UGT), the identifying personnel reason code (PRC), cor-
        rective actions, and a GWD for each; “AFSC/REQ/ASGN/AVAIL /UGT/PRC.” Include a discus-
        sion of action(s) taken to resolve the problem. Use Chapter 3, Table 3.5., to indicate applicable
        PRCs.
        2.11.7.4. (ACC) Use the following data set to report all ACC Combat Air Forces (CAF) person-
        nel and include a synopsis of action(s) to solve the problem (if applicable): POSITION/AFSC/
        REQ/ ASGN/AVAIL/UGT/PRC (use no data sign (-) for positions/AFSCs which are fully
        manned).
        2.11.7.5. (Added-ACC) OSS, ASOS, and Weather Units. List weather personnel in remarks
        using the TPASG label in the following data set: AFSC/REQUIRED/ASSIGNED/AVAILABLE.
     2.11.8. For the Equipment and Supplies O/H area, explain the following:
        2.11.8.1. Write a remark using the ESRES label (Primary Reason Measured Resource Subarea
        Level for Equipment and Supplies Not C-1 (ESREF) for Secondary or Tertiary Missions) when
        equipment and supplies O/H is less than S-1. Ensure each subarea field, reflecting a percentage of
        “less than 90%, ” is described in the associated remark label; e.g., ESSA4. Ensure remarks accu-
        rately reflect the specified reason code (Table 4.5.) and contain all pertinent details such as readi-
        ness driver national stock number (NSN), item data, get-well date, kit serial number (as
        applicable), on-hand versus authorized quantities, POC, etc. Remarks for each allowance standard
        equipment shortage resulting in a LIMFAC must contain the NSN, quantity short, allowance
        source code (ASC), equipment account number, and an account custodian POC.
        2.11.8.1. (ACC) Aviation units will report mobility equipment deficiencies/shortages for each
        UTC tasked in section II of DOC statement in ESSA 5 remark label in the following manner:
        UTC/equip type/NSN/total equip auth/total equip avail/deficiency.
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                    55


         2.11.8.1.1. If Electronic Countermeasure (ECM) pods O/H and mission ready are less than 90
         percent, provide a remark on ECM pod status using the ESSA4 label.
         2.11.8.1.2. The status of medical WRM project codes not reported in subareas are provided
         using the ESRES label. No remarks are required other than the project code and percent filled
         from the Stock Status Report (i.e., BA: 67%).
     2.11.8.2. Write a remark using the Major Equipment - Possessed (MEPSD) label to account for a
     flying unit’s aircraft assigned but not possessed. Report the number of assigned backup aircraft
     inventory (BAI) aircraft total, the tail number and location of aircraft in programmed depot main-
     tenance (PDM), on loan to or from another unit, and estimated return date(s).
         2.11.8.2.1. Using AFSORTSDET, format the aircraft summary narrative according to the
         example below:


         (date) AIRCRAFT SUMMARY
         AUTHORIZED 16, ASSIGNED 10, POSSESSED 7
         TAIL / LOCATION/ REASON               / ESTIMATED RETURN DATE
         00452 / MBPB         / PDM            / 23JAN03
         80217 / MBPB         / SPEEDLINE      / 23SEP02


         2.11.8.2.2. In the aircraft summary, UAV units will report the number of systems authorized,
         assigned and possessed.
     2.11.8.3. In a RICDA remark, report mobility A-bags (general use) and B-bags (cold weather),
     see AFMAN 23-110 for a list of minimum compositions. Remark will be formatted as follows:


     (Date) MOBILITY BAGS
     TYPE           AUTH/REQ                ONHAND
     A-BAG               10                   10

  2.11.9. For the Equipment Condition area, explain the following:
     2.11.9.1. Write a remark using the ERRES label (Primary Reason Measured Resource Area Level
     for Equipment Condition Not C-1 (ERREF) for Secondary or Tertiary Missions) when equipment
     and supplies condition is less than R-1. Ensure each subarea field reflecting a percentage “less
     than 90% ” status is described in the associated remark label; e.g., ERSA4.
     2.11.9.2. Additionally, aircraft units will provide explanatory remarks for conditions less than 75
     percent in the ERRES label.
  2.11.10. For the Training area, identify the primary cause of training program limitations.
     2.11.10.1. Write a remark using the TRRES label (Primary Reason Measured Resource Subarea
     Level for Training Not C-1 (TRREF) for Secondary or Tertiary Missions) when the training con-
56                                                           AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


        dition is less than T-1. Write remarks for each subarea reported as less than 85%; e.g., TRSA1 for
        units using Method C, Option 1 or 2.
        2.11.10.2. Regardless of training method and option, when multiple subareas are less than T-1,
        summarize problems in a remark using the TRRES and/or TRREF labels. Ensure each subarea
        field reflecting a “less than T-1” status is described in an individual label remark, also regardless
        of method used.
        2.11.10.3. When current or forecast Air Education and Training Command (AETC) formal train-
        ing school allocation deficiencies exist, write a remark using the TRRAT label. Begin the narra-
        tive remark with “AETC:” followed by the deficiency short title, and continue with a detailed
        summary of current or future deficiency, the current status or action taken to resolve the defi-
        ciency, additional actions required, and the impact on the unit’s ability to undertake its wartime
        mission. Using AFSORTSDET, format the AETC formal training school allocation deficiency
        narrative according to the example below:
        (date) AETC: (list short title deficiency or future requirement)
        CURRENT STATUS/ACTION
        ADDITIONAL ACTIONS
        IMPACT ON UNIT
        FUTURE REQUIREMENT(S)

        2.11.10.4. When required, CE units report the last date the unit attended Silver Flag Training
        using the TRSA3 remark label.
     2.11.11. Overall C-level data must be explained in a REASN label remark (Overall Reason Unit Sub-
     area is Not C-1 (REASF) for Secondary or Tertiary Missions). The remark should summarize prob-
     lems in sufficient detail to ascertain unit readiness and prompt review of specific measured area
     remarks. The following situational examples would require a remark:
        2.11.11.1. Which mission(s) the unit cannot fully support or undertake when its Overall C-level is
        less than C-1.
        2.11.11.2. The commander’s rationale, supporting a subjectively assessed C-level and area(s)
        where the commander disagrees with the measured area C-level.
            2.11.11.2.1. (Added-ACC) When using the REASN remark, commanders will fully explain
            all reasons for assessment to include reason for shortfalls and what is being done to fulfill
            shortfalls. EXAMPLE: "Unit is C-3 for personnel shortages in 7 level fuels technicians. Com-
            mander assesses to C-1 for ability to provide additional 5 level fuel technicians to fill the 7
            level shortfalls. Projected get well date of 1 Jan 07."
        2.11.11.3. The programmed or estimated date the unit will again be able to undertake its major
        wartime mission if less than C-1 or after undergoing a major equipment conversion or transition.
        2.11.11.4. The deactivation date planned for the unit. If within one year of deactivation, do not list
        personnel shortages unless specifically instructed to do so by the MAJCOM.
        2.11.11.5. When a unit fails an ORI or NSI, consider a commander assessed downgrade to the
        unit’s Overall C-level until the deficiency causing the unsatisfactory rating is resolved. Units may
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                     57


      assume successful re-inspection; when it is required and the inspection team provides applicable
      dates. Provide remarks to explain the condition in the REASN and/or REASF labels.
   2.11.12. Using the RICDA label, all SORTS reporting units will include a written remark in each Pri-
   mary, Secondary, and/or Tertiary database supplying the full rank and name of their primary and alter-
   nate SORTS monitors. Minimum entry will include contact telephone number(s) and e-mail
   address(s). Current DOC Statement date will be included as the final line of text.
   EXAMPLE: SORTS MONITORS FOR THE 123XFW ARE PRIMARY TSGT JOHN DOE.
   ALTERNATES SSGT JANE DOE AND A1C MAY JUNE. DSN 999-8888/ 7777. E-MAIL
   123XFW@EXAMPLE.AF.MIL. Current DOC Statement date: DDMMMYY.

2.12. Overall Reason Codes.
   2.12.1. Assigning a Primary Reason Code (PRC). Units must report a reason code against the Overall
   C-level using the reason codes in Table 2.5., unless reporting C-1. When partially deployed, use
   DEFG (See Table 2.7. for additional clarification on use of PRCs).
   2.12.2. Reporting a PRC. The PRC will be entered in the REASN and/or REASF fields.
      2.12.2.1. When the Overall C-Level is less than C-1, pick that resource area most affecting the
      lowered C-Level. Use P for personnel, S for equipment and supplies O/H, R for equipment condi-
      tion, and T for training.
      2.12.2.2. If the Overall C-Level (1- 4) is changed by commander assessment the X reason code
      will be used. See paragraph 2.13. for supporting reason codes.
          2.12.2.2.1. If the Overall C-level is based on commander assessment of partial deployment
          capability, up or down, the X reason code will be used under the REASN remark label and the
          DEFG will be placed in the SECRN field. Detailed deployment remarks under the REASN
          remark label will be included to reflect DEFG, the percentage of the unit’s deployable capabil-
          ity that is currently deployed, and the rationale for the commander’s change to the calculated
          C-Level.
          2.12.2.2.2. If the Overall C-level is based solely on measured area calculations (REASN not
          X and not C-1) and the unit is partially deployed P, S, R, or T will be placed in REASN and the
          DEFG as described below will be placed in the SECRN field. A detailed explanation will be
          included under the REASN remark label. Using AFSORTSDET, format the reason summary
          narrative according the example below:
          (date) PARTIAL UNIT DEPLOYMENT
          REASON CODE (E)/6 F-16 DEPLOYED TO BASE X FOR OPERATION ABC; 1 60K
          AIRCRAFT LOADER AND 2 10K ALL-TERRAIN FORKLIFTS DEPLOYED TO BASE Y
          FOR HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT OPERATIONS; 16 SECURITY PERSONNEL
          DEPLOYED TO BASE Z FOR HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT OPERATIONS.
      2.12.2.3. If the Overall C-Level is C-1, there is no partial deployment reflected (no DEFG
      needed), and one or more of the resource areas are not measured (reported as code 6), the 6 reason
      code will be used. No remarks are required for a 6 reason code.
      2.12.2.4. If the Overall C-Level is capped by AF FAMs, (i.e., due to resource allocation) below
      C-1, enter the maximum level possible in the Category Level Limitation (LIM) label for primary
58                                                          AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


        missions (Category Level Subarea Limitation (LIMF) for secondary or tertiary missions) in the
        CATLIM set. Enter a P, S, R, or T in the Reason for Category Level Limitation (RLIM) label for
        the area most affected by the resource allocation (Reason for Category Level Subarea Limitation
        (RLIMF) label for secondary or tertiary missions).

2.13. Assigning a Secondary or Tertiary Reason Code. The Overall C-Level is changed by the com-
mander, enter X in REASN field and assign a secondary code to explain the primary reason for the deci-
sion to change the C-level (See Table 2.7. for additional clarification on use of secondary and tertiary
reason codes).
     2.13.1. When upgrading, use the codes: PUP for personnel, SUP for equipment and supplies O/H,
     RUP for equipment condition, and TUP for training.
     2.13.2. When downgrading, use the applicable reason code in Chapter 3, Chapter 4, Chapter 5, and
     Chapter 6. Do not use PUP, SUP, RUP, or TUP when downgrading.
     2.13.3. SECRN is mandatory if REASN equals X or if Overall is less than 1 and DEFG is reported in
     REASN and/or REASF fields.
     2.13.4. TERRN will be used if REASN equals X and SECRN equals DEFG when READY is less
     than 1 (Tertiary Reason Unit is Not C-1 (TERRF) field for Secondary or Tertiary Missions).

Section 2C—Air Force Unique Data

2.14. Special Mission Capability Data. Special mission capabilities are tasks, equipment, and missions
listed in Table 2.3. Generally, they add flexibility to mission accomplishment and require specialized
equipment or training. The SORTS DOC Statement will state which special mission capabilities to
include in C-Level calculations. It will also state where to report data on up to four specific capabilities.
For each special mission capability:
     2.14.1. Determine the SMCC by using Table 2.3. Enter the code under the SMCC 1 through 4 fields,
     as applicable.
     2.14.2. Determine the number of aircraft required to have the capability. Use the SORTS DOC State-
     ment to find the number required to have the specialized equipment. Enter the number under Special
     Mission Required Aircraft (SMRA) 1 through 4 fields, as applicable.
     2.14.3. Count the number of aircraft mission ready and available with the special capability. Count
     only those aircraft mission ready and available and have the required specialized equipment mission
     ready and available according to paragraph 5.7. Enter the number under the Special Mission Aircraft
     Available (SMAA) 1 through 4 fields, as applicable.
     2.14.4. Determine the number of crews required to have the specialized training. Use the SORTS
     DOC Statement to determine the number required and enter the number under the Special Mission
     Required Crews (SMRC) 1 through 4 fields, as applicable.
     2.14.5. Count the number of mission ready and available crews with specialized training. Count only
     those crews with specialized training which are mission ready and available according to paragraph
     6.2.3. Enter the number under the Special Mission Available Crews (SMAC) 1 thorough 4 fields, as
     applicable.

                              PERSONNEL MEASURED AREA DATA

3.1. Personnel. A critical part of SORTS readiness reporting is the status of the unit’s personnel
resources. Units compute the personnel P-level based on the percentages of total and critical personnel
available to accomplish the unit’s required wartime mission. For units with an in-place or dual (in place
and mobility) wartime mission, personnel wartime requirements are based on authorized funded positions
in their UMDs. For units with mobility only missions, the requirements are the manpower details of their
UTC(s). The following documents are used as sources for the personnel measured area: MEML, UMD,
SORTS Personnel Availability Roster, and the MANFOR UTC Detail Report from the Manpower Per-
sonnel Module - Base-Level (MANPER-B) system. Personnel measurement is limited to US military and
specified DoD civilian personnel. Foreign national military, foreign national civilian, and contractor per-
sonnel are not counted in the measured personnel area. Active duty units will not count ANG and Reserve
personnel unless gained by the unit as a result of mobilization.
3.1. (ACC) Personnel. The Air Force SORTS Personnel Availability Roster will be used to produce per-
sonnel information and duty status rosters unless the use of alternative rosters has been approved. To
obtain approval, submit the roster and sample output products to HQ ACC/A1D.
   3.1.1. Total Personnel
       3.1.1.1. TPAUTH for all units is based on the unit’s UMD and/or its DOC required UTCs.
           3.1.1.1.1. For units with an in-place generation mission or an in-place generation and mobility
           mission (see unit DOC Statement), the source document for TPAUTH is the unit’s UMD.
           MAJCOMs must provide instructions to their units on how to identify wartime-required and
           funded positions, i.e. a DOC instruction of "Measure and report the availability of unit person-
           nel to fill all funded military positions in your UMD.”
           3.1.1.1.2. For units with a mobility only mission (see unit DOC Statement), TPAUTH is the
           total of the manpower requirements identified in the deployment UTC(s) the unit is required to
           support. Contact the local manpower office for a UTC Manpower Detail Report for each UTC.
       3.1.1.2. TPASG is determined by counting all personnel in a unit from the time they arrive at the
       unit until they depart on a PCS, permanent change of assignment (PCA), or separate from the Air
       Force. All personnel are counted for TPASG regardless of AFSC, skill level, or grade and may
       exceed the TPAUTH number. Units will use a unit manpower personnel roster (UMPR) or similar
       product provided by their CSS or Military Personnel Flight (MPF) to determine total assigned per-
       sonnel. Before preparing the SORTS report, the unit SORTS monitor should coordinate with the
       unit CSS to ensure records in the Personnel System are updated and reflect the true status of unit
       personnel.
       3.1.1.3. TPAVL is determined by calculating the number of TPASG that are available to the unit
       within the DOC response time and are able to perform the assigned mission (see paragraph 3.2. for
       specific availability guidance). TPAVL are counted regardless of AFSC, skill level, or grade and
       may exceed the TPAUTH number.
       3.1.1.4. DoD Civilian Personnel can be included in personnel counts when they occupy war-
       time-required positions. Only Emergency Essential (EE) (IAW AFI 10-231, “Federal Civilian
       Deployment Guide”) and “Key” DoD civilians (IAW AFI 36-507, “Mobilization of the Civilian
68                                                           AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


        Workforce”) are included in calculations in the SORTS personnel area. Other DoD civilian and
        general contractor personnel impacting a unit’s readiness may be reported on as part of the com-
        mander’s assessment.
            3.1.1.4.1. Do not count civilian personnel in SORTS if they have Reserve or Guard commit-
            ments during crisis or wartime that can make them subject to recall.
            3.1.1.4.2. MAJCOMs must mark SORTS DOC Statements to include United States (US)
            DoD civilian personnel in the personnel measurement area when they are part of the unit’s
            wartime requirement (either by occupying wartime required authorizations and/or as part of
            the unit’s deployment UTCs). A remark on SORTS DOC Statements should indicate if and
            how a civilian occupation code converts to a military AFSC.
        3.1.1.5. Foreign Local Nationals will not be counted in SORTS due to questionable availability
        during wartime contingencies.
     3.1.2. Critical Personnel
        3.1.2.1. The reporting of critical personnel is based on the AFSC’s identified by the HQ USAF
        functional area manager as detailed in Table 3.1. Personnel with particular AFSCs are considered
        “critical” if they meet the following criteria:
            3.1.2.1.1. Personnel with AFSC(s) that are essential to fulfilling the unit’s wartime mission
            tasks.
            3.1.2.1.2. Absence of personnel possessing AFSC(s) that would render the unit severely defi-
            cient or totally unable to execute its wartime mission.
            3.1.2.1.3. AFSC is part of a critically manned career field subject to special monitoring.
        3.1.2.2. Officers who have a critical AFSC as their duty or primary AFSC, or enlisted who have a
        critical AFSC as their primary or control AFSC are considered critical.
        3.1.2.3. Enlisted members who are cross training and hold a 3-level control AFSC in their new
        career field present a special circumstance. Those personnel can be counted against critical
        requirements in their former career field so long as they hold the correct primary or control AFSC
        and skill level, their grade meets or exceeds the UMD requirement, and their commander deter-
        mines they are qualified to perform the job.
        3.1.2.4. CPAUR is determined by counting the number of TPAUTH positions that also match the
        AFSC/skill levels listed in Table 3.1.
        3.1.2.5. CPASG is determined by counting the number of critical personnel authorized positions
        that can be filled by a qualified person. To count as qualified, the person must have the required
        AFSC and meet or exceed the required skill level. An officer must have the correct duty AFSC
        and grade and enlisted personnel must have the correct control or primary AFSC/skill level com-
        pared to the critical position requirement. Critical Personnel who are surplus to the unit’s critical
        personnel requirement in an AFSC will not be counted as part of the critical personnel assignment
        unless they can be used to fill a requirement shortage IAW authorized substitutions as defined
        below:
            3.1.2.5.1. AFSC substitution: AFSC Substitution of critical personnel is only allowed when
            authorized by UTC MISCAP, WMP-1 Functional Annexes, or Functional AFIs.
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                     69


         3.1.2.5.2. Skill-level substitution: The UTC MISCAP, functional AFIs, or the USAF WMP-1
         annexes govern authorized skill-level substitutions. Substitutions will only be made when
         authorized! IAW CJCSM 3150.02, critical personnel substitutions must have the required
         AFSC and meet or exceed the skill level required. Commanders should review the qualifica-
         tions of any substitutes to ensure the UTC requirement is not degraded. Once review is made,
         substitutes may be included in critical calculations
     3.1.2.6. CPAVL is determined by calculating the number of CPASG that are available to the unit
     within the DOC response time and are able to perform the assigned mission (see paragraph 3.2. for
     specific availability guidance).
     3.1.2.7. Critical Personnel overages will not be reported in the CPASG and CPAVL data fields
     but may be reported using a remark under the applicable label (CPASG or CPAVL).
     3.1.2.8. (Added-ACC) Units will coordinate with local Manpower Organization Flight (MOF)
     on UTC/UMD mismatch data prior to submission into the SORTS system. Coordination/ concur-
     rence with data will be indicated in SORTS report. Report UTC/UMD mismatches under the
     "PRRAT" label using the following format: UTC/AFSC/required by UTC/authorized by UMD.
     3.1.2.9. (Added-ACC) Measured units will not alter manpower detail of any UTC without prior
     approval of HQ ACC/A3XF. UTCs establish manpower taskings for which there are normally
     corresponding manpower authorizations on the measured unit's Unit Manpower Document
     (UMD). A measured unit that finds an imbalance between UTC requirements and UMD authori-
     zations will report this to HQ ACC/A3XF, the base MO and the appropriate FAM for resolution.
  3.1.3. Special Provisions for Personnel Counting
     3.1.3.1. The SORTS DOC Statement must indicate whether DSU personnel must be included in
     the count.
     3.1.3.2. Units with multiple weapon systems will allocate resources to meet the wartime require-
     ments of each system.
     3.1.3.3. Personnel TDY or temporarily attached to a measured unit will not be included in the
     gaining unit’s assigned and available numbers.
     3.1.3.4. Total force organizations or units with a joint mission that have multiple service person-
     nel assigned, attached or a combination of active duty and reserve component personnel will use
     their respective service or component unit UMD to determine total personnel requirements, e.g., a
     total force wing requires support from the Army, Navy, and Air National Guard. The Army oper-
     ating location (OL) has a UMD of 20 personnel, the Navy OL 20 personnel, the ANG unit 100
     personnel and the Active Duty unit 150 personnel, the total requirement is 290. Critical personnel
     will be assessed using the same guidelines based on specific AFSC/MOS requirements listed in
     the UMD or UTCs required to support.
     3.1.3.5. AFRC and NGB personnel attached to an active duty unit, for training purposes, will not
     be included in personnel numbers.
     3.1.3.6. If a unit is assigned a fragmented portion of a UTC (split-tasking), report the UTC portion
     that has been assigned on the unit DOC Statement. Split-tasking will be reflected by using a minus
     sign (-) immediately after the UTC. {example: FFGK5(-)}. The portion of the UTC that is
70                                                          AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


        assigned, or is not assigned, is then spelled out within the Remarks section of the DOC Statement
        (See Attachment 2 for further DOC Statement guidance).
        3.1.3.7. Individual Mobility Augmentees (IMAs) will only be counted when assigned as part of a
        mobilization or Reserve Call-up. Unit’s reporting IMA numbers in their personnel area will
        explain how the IMAs are used under a PRRES label remark.

3.2. Determining Personnel Availability. Unit personnel may be considered available if they are
assigned to the unit and meet one of the following requirements:
     3.2.1. Are present at home station or can be present within the prescribed unit response time.
     3.2.2. Are at a deployed location and can be ready to redeploy within the unit response time.
     3.2.3. Are not restricted from deploying or employing with the unit (this is for units with a mobility
     mission).
     3.2.4. Are counted if their duty status/availability code(s), on a SORTS Personnel Availability Roster
     and the Duty Status Roster, match those from AFI 10-403, and the commander determines them avail-
     able where appropriate. Personnel having a duty status/availability code restricting them from deploy-
     ment (IAW AFI 10-403) may be considered available for in-place missions as determined by the
     commander.
     3.2.5. Use the following SORTS rules to determine personnel availability according to a unit’s DOC
     Statement Mission Title (Section 2).
        3.2.5.1. For in-place generation, alert, OPERATIONS PLAN 8044 REVISION 03, or surveil-
        lance missions, count personnel available if they can be expected to return to their assigned duty
        location within response time.
        3.2.5.2. For mobility missions, count personnel available if they are expected to be ready to
        deploy from their present location within DOC response time.
        3.2.5.3. For combined in-place generation and mobility missions, allocate personnel to each mis-
        sion and then apply the rules for each type mission.
        3.2.5.4. For security forces combined in-place generation and mobility missions DOC State-
        ments, allocate all personnel required for UTC or mobility deployment and apply all remaining
        available personnel towards home station force protection.
     3.2.6. When a unit temporarily transfers (lends) personnel to another unit, the supplying measured
     unit will continue to measure and report the personnel in its SORTS unless otherwise directed by the
     MAJCOM(s) involved. Likewise a unit receiving personnel from another unit will not measure or
     count those personnel unless otherwise directed. Temporary assignment of personnel will not justify
     improved SORTS C-levels. However, support from other units may be factored into a commander’s
     assessment for the Overall C-level.
     3.2.6. (ACC) Robusting of personnel (moving personnel from one unit to another to enhance C-rat-
     ing) is not authorized in ACC.
     3.2.7. MAJCOMs should provide additional guidance to assist unit commanders to consistently and
     accurately determine whether members are available and ready to deploy within the response time.
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                      71


3.3. Total and Critical Personnel Percentage Calculation. The lower P-level from total or critical per-
sonnel is used to determine the personnel resource area P-level.
   3.3.1. Total Personnel Percentage. Total personnel are calculated using the following rules:
       3.3.1.1. If 10 or more people are calculated, divide total personnel available by the total number
       of personnel authorized, multiply by 100 and round off to a whole number.
       3.3.1.2. If nine or less people are calculated, use Table 3.2. to derive the percentage.
       3.3.1.3. Enter the percent in the PERTP field.
   3.3.2. Critical Personnel Percentage. Units use one of two methods for computing critical personnel
   percentages; the single percentage computation method or the multiple percentage computation
   method. The method used is derived from Table 3.1. for each unit type. If the entries in Table 3.1.,
   columns B and/or C are separated by commas only, the single percentage computation method is used.
   If the entries in Table 3.1., columns B and C include semicolons, the multiple percentage computation
   method is used. Calculate critical personnel using the following rules:
       3.3.2.1. For support, non-combat air forces (CAF) units, space, and missile units, if 10 or more
       personnel are calculated, divide the number of critical personnel available by the number of criti-
       cal personnel authorized (UMD) or required (UTC). Multiply the result by 100 and round off to a
       whole number.
       3.3.2.2. Single percentage computation method. Total the number of personnel positions from
       TPAUTH that contain the AFSCs and skill levels identified in Table 3.1. as critical. This number
       becomes the denominator in the percentage equation.
       3.3.2.3. Multiple percentage computation method. Compute a separate percentage for each packet
       of critical personnel. See paragraph 3.5. for an explanation of packets. Report the lowest percent-
       age of all of the packets in the PERTC data field.
       3.3.2.4. Percentage computations. The following applies regardless of the method used.
           3.3.2.4.1. Availability of personnel is determined using paragraph 3.2.
           3.3.2.4.2. If the number in the denominator of the percentage equation is nine or less person-
           nel , use Table 3.2. to derive percentage.
           3.3.2.4.3. If the personnel calculation baseline (denominator in the percentage equation) is 10
           or more personnel , divide the number of critical personnel available by the number of critical
           personnel authorized (UMD) or required (UTC). Multiply the result by 100 and round off to a
           whole number.
           3.3.2.4.4. Enter the percentage in the PERTC data field.
       3.3.2.5. CAF aviation units will calculate their personnel numbers using the following:
       3.3.2.5. (ACC) The personnel C-levels of ACC CAF type units are derived using the following
       procedures. Using an approved Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) shadow worksheet, identify each
       aircrew position by the Authorized (* crew ratio) and Assigned. Identify critical maintenance
       AFSCs from AFI 10-201 Table 3.1., or as identified on the unit's DOC Statement. Perform your
       calculations as directed by AFI 10-201 Paragraph 3.3. and sub-paragraphs. Compare the LOW-
       EST aircrew calculated percentage against the maintenance calculated percentage on the work-
72                                                           AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


        sheet. This computation drives the P-Level for that unit. Unit commander may choose to assess
        based on the resulting P-Level. See Table 3.6. (Added) for an example.
            3.3.2.5.1. See paragraph 3.3.2.3. to calculate CAF multiple percentages.
            3.3.2.5.2. Find the number of personnel available for each crew position (i.e., pilot, co-pilot,
            navigator, etc.). Calculate critical maintenance personnel as you would for non-combat air-
            craft units using paragraph 3.3.2.1. guidance.
            3.3.2.5.3. If 10 or more aircrew are calculated, divide the number aircrew available by the
            number of aircrew required for each crew position. Multiply the result by 100 and round off to
            the whole number.
            3.3.2.5.4. If nine or less aircrew are calculated, find the percent using the number available by
            crew position (Reference Table 3.2.).
            3.3.2.5.5. Enter the lowest percentage between aircrew personnel positions and the Critical
            Maintenance AFSCs in the PERTC field.
        3.3.2.6. Non-CAF aircraft units may elect to use CAF criteria for measuring critical personnel
        including when GTACS CAF units report via aircrew duty position method.

3.4. Personnel Reason Codes.
     3.4.1. Select the most specific reason code from Table 3.5., when P-level is less than P-1.
     3.4.2. If the reason code has changed from the last reported, enter the new reason code in the PRRES
     or PRREF data fields.

3.5. Critical Personnel Packet Formulation.
     3.5.1. When a unit’s personnel resources are sufficiently diverse, measuring certain critical personnel
     by the single percentage computation method may mask shortages in critical AFSCs and skill levels.
     In these cases, HQ USAF FAMs may arrange critical AFSCs listed in Table 3.1., into groups called
     packets and separate the packets by semicolons (;). Packets will be reflected in the unit’s DOC State-
     ment. Alternatively, UTCs may be substituted for AFSC packets when they have manpower details
     assigned. (Examples: 1C37X, 1C35X; 3C072, 3C052 or UTC-QFEBA; QFEBB;). The critical per-
     sonnel packets will be reported using the multiple percentage computation method.
     3.5.2. When packets are used, units will calculate a separate percentage for each designated packet
     listed in Table 3.1. using the procedures in paragraph 3.3.2. The lowest percentage of all packets will
     be reported in the PERTC field.
     3.5.3. MAJCOM CAF FAMs may designate non-aircrew personnel packet(s) using Table 3.1.

3.6. Commander Assessment and Remarks. Commanders should address the following personnel
issues when submitting a unit assessment, if applicable:
     3.6.1. In the event of UMD/UTC mismatches (paragraph 2.11.7.3.), personnel measurement calcula-
     tions will be made based on the UMD requirement for the mismatched position(s). Commanders with
     UTC requirements not on the UMD (not authorized) should assess the Overall C-level downward to
     reflect the impact of the “missing” manpower authorizations and remarks should illuminate the spe-
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                    73


   cific manpower authorization mismatches with the UTC tasked to support. See paragraph 2.11.7.4. for
   remark requirement.
   3.6.2. Resource capabilities provided by overseas host nation or by foreign national contract person-
   nel should be considered in the commander’s assessment when relevant.
   3.6.3. When non-aircrew personnel are not included in the personnel measurement, flying unit com-
   manders must assess these required capabilities when assigning an Overall C-Level.

NOTES:
     1. X means all AFSCs in source that match remaining characters are critical AFSCs. * means all
        suffixed and non-suffixed AFSCs in the source document that match remaining characters are
        critical. Consider AFSCs that convert as critical.
         2. HQ AF/A3OR, as authorized may augment this table by message. MAJCOM SORTS offices
            will disseminate the supplemented message to subordinate units.
         3. Rule 2 Aeromedical units use “X” as a prefix to identify flight qualification. In this case, “X”
            does not have the same significance as in note 1 above.
         4. Rule 21 AFSC 6C091 may be substituted for a 64P3.
         5. Rule 13 Number of personnel tasked under UTC is listed on unit DOC Statement. Two mobil-
            ity positions for AFSC 2S0X1 fall under UTC XFBPF, however, the second position is
            non-critical.
         6. Rule 13 Four of the 13 mobility positions per XFBJ1 UTC are critical. The remaining nine
            positions, regardless of AFSC, are non-critical.
         7. Rule 13 The mobility position per XFBKB UTC is critical.
         8. Rule 13 Both of the mobility positions per XFBYC UTC are critical and will not be substi-
            tuted.
         9. Rule 13 One of the three mobility positions per JFBBS UTC. Remaining two positions are not
            critical.

           EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES ON HAND (O/H) MEASURED AREA DATA

4.1. Equipment and Supplies O/H Reporting. Equipment and supplies O/H measurement is used to
indicate the resource status of authorized equipment and supplies required to support the unit’s wartime
mission(s), as identified in the unit SORTS DOC Statement. This measurement may indicate budget and
supply problems when details are known. Resources measured in this area are reported in the EQSUPPLY
set.
     4.1.1. Equipment and supplies O/H reporting is based on a unit’s wartime requirement.
        4.1.1.1. Units with an in-place generation or combined in-place generation and mobility mission,
        use the applicable documents (AS, Air Staff-level functional area guidance, UTC LOGDET, etc.)
        as the base line for equipment and supplies measurement as supplemented by Table 4.4. subareas.
        These subareas will normally reflect those items on the applicable documents that are critical to
        mission accomplishment.
        4.1.1.2. Units with a mobility-only mission, use LOGDET, plus any applicable Air Staff-level
        functional area guidance, as the baseline for equipment and supplies measurement as supple-
        mented by Table 4.4. subareas for each UTC it is required to support.
        4.1.1.3. Units compute the equipment and supplies S-level, for combat essential and support
        equipment and supplies, based on the availability of wartime required equipment and supplies.
        Equipment and supplies items are considered available if they are assigned to the unit and are
        physically present or can be present within prescribed unit response times.
        4.1.1.4. For equipment and supplies deployed in support of Small Scale Contingencies (SSC),
        equipment and supply items may be considered available to units with mobility missions if unit
        personnel can make the equipment and supplies ready to redeploy within the DOC response time.
        4.1.1.5. For in-place (generation), in-place and mobility, or mobility-only missions, the full war-
        time requirement of equipment and supplies is determined by the applicable authorizing or
        requirements documents.
        4.1.1.6. (Added-ACC) Equipment and Supplies are defined as those mobility coded (use code A)
        items listed in the Allowance Standards (AS). Units with a generation and mobility mission or
        mobility only mission will always report equipment and supplies on hand as listed in the AS for all
        DOC statement UTCs. These same AS items should also be listed in the standard UTC LOGDET.
        Non-AS items, as listed in the UTC LOGDET, for which there is no Allowance Source Code
        (ASC) are not considered SORTS reportable unless otherwise specified on the unit's DOC state-
        ment. When required equipment and supplies are listed in the LOGDET without an AS reference,
        the commander may use the Commanders Assessment block for reporting critical equipment and
        supply shortages and changing the units overall assessment. Units with a mobility only mission
        will report equipment and supplies on hand as listed in the LOGDET when no AS or AS items
        exist (i.e., communication units).
     4.1.2. The formula for equipment and supplies computations is the number of equipment and supplies
     available divided by the wartime requirement multiplied by 100.
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                         85


4.2. Equipment and Supplies Subareas (ESSAs). This measured area allows measurement of up to
nine subareas. Consider the following:
   4.2.1. In-place/Generation or Generation and Mobility Missions. Use the SORTS DOC Statement,
   LOGDET, IRSP, ASs, and Air Staff-level functional area guidance, as necessary, to determine equip-
   ment types and numbers authorized/required.
      4.2.1.1. For IRSP, count only XD-coded repairable items to avoid tainting results with large num-
      bers of expendable items that current assessment tools cannot model their mission impact (BEAR
      base squadrons excluded).
      4.2.1.2. MAJCOMs report strategic airlift aircraft spare engines under a fleet status report.
   4.2.2. Mobility Missions. Use DOC Statement to determine the types of equipment and supplies to
   measure and use UTC LOGDET and applicable Air Staff-level functional area guidance to determine
   specific equipment and supply items required.
      4.2.2.1. If more than one UTC is measured, add their individual requirements together.
      4.2.2.2. For MRSP, count only XD-coded repairable items to avoid skewing the count with large
      numbers of expendable items whose mission impact cannot be modeled using current assessment
      tools (BEAR base squadrons excluded).
   4.2.3. Item Possession. To determine the number of items a unit will possess within it’s response
   time, the unit must have actual responsibility for the items according to applicable supply regulations.
   The following items are not considered possessed:
      4.2.3.1. Additional or BAI in excess of the number authorized or required. Include backup aircraft
      if MEASG does not exceed MEARD.
      4.2.3.2. Items in PDM or Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) depot modification.
      4.2.3.3. Items temporarily in the hands of another unit due to long term maintenance (lasting
      more than seven days or for crash or battle damage repair) are not considered possessed by the
      receiving unit. If the unit has items on loan from another unit, the items from the other unit will not
      be counted.
      4.2.3.4. Items loaned to another unit to augment their resources will be considered possessed by
      the owning unit. Receiving unit will not use these resources for SORTS reporting. Items will not
      be double-counted. Units receiving equipment on loan should consider a commander’s assessment
      of the Overall C-level based on support.
   4.2.4. MRSP and IRSP:
      4.2.4.1. Include XD-coded repairable items, but not XB/XF-coded expendable items. Large num-
      bers of XB may mask problems with higher value XD items (BEAR base squadrons excluded).
      Include only items serviceable/repairable within the response time.
      4.2.4.2. Include the possessed primary operating stock (POS).
      4.2.4.3. Add the items O/H for each measured subarea to obtain a subarea total.
   4.2.5. Electronic Attack (EA) Pods. If Pods are O/H and mission ready, but are less than 90 percent
   mission capable, provide a remark on EA Pod status using the ESSA4 label.
86                                                        AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


     4.2.6. (Added-ACC) Weather flights, Detachments (DET), Operating Locations (OL) and Weather
     Squadrons. Report tactical observing equipment in remarks using ESSA1 label, upper-air observing
     equipment in remarks using ESSA2 label and tactical forecasting equipment in remarks using ESSA3
     label. Use the following format for each label: TYPE/REQUIRED/ ASSIGNED/AVAILABLE. If
     applicable, report overall percentage fill of Modified Table of Organizational Equipment (MTOE)
     line items, for every pertinent MTOE, by UIC and paragraph number using the ESSA4 label in the fol-
     lowing format: UIC/PARA/PERCENT. Report support METOC equipment stipulated in Table 4.1.,
     Column C in remarks using ESSA6 label in the following format: TYPE/REQUIRED/ASSIGNED/
     AVAILABLE.

4.3. Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) General Policy. BEAR units report SORTS
data against stated SORTS DOC Statement mission. Each unit must determine and report their status on
the basis of critical BEAR equipment and supplies (support) assigned. Report using only the assets the
unit is authorized. Specific equipment allowances are included in AFI 25-101, Chap 7 “USAF Bear Base
Systems,” and in AS 157, 158 and 159.
     4.3.1. The following measured units report on the designated BEAR systems:
        4.3.1.1. 49 Material Maintenance Group (MMG) Holloman AFB, NM for assigned ACC BEAR
        assets.
        4.3.1.2. 609 Air Support Squadron (ASUS) Shaw AFB, SC for assigned USCENTAF BEAR and
        Harvest Falcon assets.
        4.3.1.3. 607 ASUS Osan AB, Korea for assigned PACAF Harvest Eagle, T-550, and BEAR
        assets.
        4.3.1.4. 435 Materiel Maintenance Squadron (MMS) Sembach, Germany for assigned USAFE
        BEAR assets.
        4.3.1.5. 60 Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS), Travis AFB, CA and 305 LRS, McGuire AFB,
        NJ for assigned AMC Swift BEAR assets.
     4.3.2. BEAR base equipment is grouped by UTC and is designed to provide a functional capability.
     UTCs also include support MRSPs that are required to make UTC end items functional. When deter-
     mining UTC capability support, MRSPs must be considered along with equipment items. Spare
     MRSPs provide repair parts and are considered separately. Spare MRSP will provide for 30 days of
     operations without re-supply. See Air Force Handbook (AFH) 10-222 for breakdown of BEAR Base
     sets and packages.

4.4. MRSP and IRSP Authorizations. New MRSP/IRSP authorizations loaded into a unit’s Standard
Base Supply System (SBSS) and requisitioned 90 days prior to authorization/activation date are assessed
beginning on the authorization date. New MRSP/IRSP authorizations start at the same time as the unit’s
specific tasking date for its wartime requirement.
     4.4.1. Revised MRSP or IRSP authorizations are provided a minimum of 30 days and a maximum of
     60 days grace period for reporting S-levels. This includes annual MRSP reviews or major RSP recon-
     figuration changes.
     4.4.1. (ACC) The beginning date for the 60-day grace period will be determined by the ACC Weapon
     System Support Branch (HQ ACC/A4LW) in the Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSP) load
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                     87


   instruction letter accompanying the revised DO40 master authorization listing. Extensions will not be
   granted.
   4.4.2. Report new authorizations starting 30/60 days after they are loaded into the SBSS, or as soon
   as the sorties/aircraft (for ASM- or WSMIS-SAM assessed units) or the RSP percent filled (where
   ASM or WSMIS-SAM are not assessed) of revised authorizations equal or exceed that of outdated
   authorizations, whichever occurs first. Continue to report the assessment of the outdated authoriza-
   tions until the conditions are met for the new authorizations, but comment on the status of the new
   authorizations in the remarks, e.g. new MRSP authorization loaded (date).
   4.4.3. Assets available in POS to fill MRSP shortages are counted as O/H in MRSP when computing
   fill percentages in SORTS.
      4.4.3.1. The MRSP percent fill is based on total authorized units, excluding Expendability,
      Recoverability, Reparability Code (ERRC) XB and XF items. The MRSP fill percent is computed
      as follows: O/H (XD) MRSP divided by (XD) MRSP authorization multiplied by 100 = (XD)
      MRSP percent fill rate.
      4.4.3.2. Assets due in from maintenance (DIFM) within DOC response time and not awaiting
      parts (AWP) are also counted as O/H. The O/H MRSP quantity is computed as follows: service-
      able MRSP + applicable POS + Forward Supply Points (FSP) + (DIFM - AWP) = O/H MRSP.
   4.4.4. Units with an in-place DOC have specific IRSP guidance. Each unit with an in-place DOC is
   provided a total wartime requirement.
      4.4.4.1. The total wartime requirement is computed as follows: IRSP + POS - O&STQ (Order
      And Ship Time Quantities).
      4.4.4.2. The O/H IRSP quantity is computed as follows: serviceable IRSP + serviceable POS + O/
      H repairable assets - O/H repairable assets coded AWP = authorized units, excluding ERRC XB
      and XF items.
      4.4.4.3. The IRSP fill percent is computed as follows: O/H IRSP quantity divided by total war-
      time requirement multiplied by 100.

4.5. Subarea Percentage Calculations.
   4.5.1. Calculate the subarea percentages. If ten or more items are authorized or required divide the
   number of items possessed within the DOC response time by the number of items authorized or
   required. The number of items counted as possessed is not to exceed the number of items authorized.
   Multiply the result by 100 to derive a percentage and round off to the nearest whole number. This
   whole number is the subarea percentage.
   4.5.2. If nine or less items are authorized or required select appropriate percentage from Table 4.2.,
   unless Table 4.4. directs otherwise. Note the derived percentages. If a percentage has changed since
   the last report, enter the new percentage under the appropriate subarea label from Table 4.4.

4.6. Combat Essential and Support Equipment O/H Percentage Calculations
   4.6.1. Determine unit combat essential versus support specification using Table 4.1., Column A (unit
   type), Column B (combat essential equipment) and Column C (support equipment).
88                                                          AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


     4.6.2. To calculate the combat essential and support equipment percentage for each area use the fol-
     lowing rules:
        4.6.2.1. If the entry lists subarea labels, use the lowest percentage found for those subareas.
        4.6.2.2. If the entry lists equipment or another document, calculate that percentage with the same
        procedure used for the subarea calculations.
     4.6.3. Note the derived percentage. If the percentage has changed since the last report, enter the new
     percentage in the EQSEE label for combat essential equipment and the EQSSE label for support
     equipment.
     4.6.4. Note the derived combat essential/supporting item counts. For aircraft units, if the item counts
     have changed since the last report, enter them in the following labels:
        4.6.4.1. The number authorized in the label MEARD.
        4.6.4.2. The number assigned in the label MEASG.
        4.6.4.3. The number possessed in the label MEPOS.
        4.6.4.4. If MRSP fill rate was used in spares assessment, enter it in the RSP field and enter an X
        in the Spares Assessment Driver (ARUSD) field.
     4.6.5. (Added-ACC) The command Vehicle Authorization Listing (VAL) is the source document for
     the total number of combat essential vehicles authorized to the unit. When the command VAL combat
     essential vehicle authorizations increase/decrease, you must submit a request to update your SORTS
     DOC statement to the ACC Transportation Division (HQ ACC/A4T) for appropriate action. Types of
     combat essential vehicles are listed on the unit's SORTS DOC statement. Note that "in-commission
     status" is not measured. Vehicles and equipment that are required to support combat operations must
     be reported, regardless of their status. Combat essential equipment on-hand, as listed in the unit's
     SORTS DOC statement, will be divided into authorized combat essential equipment in commission
     within the DOC response time. For weather units with Army-provided vehicles and equipment, do not
     report status of Army-provided vehicles and equipment if these items are reported through SORTS via
     Army channels. Instead, in the "Remarks Section", identify MTOE for each supported customer and
     provide percentage filled per paragraph 4.2.6. (Added)
     4.6.6. (Added-ACC) Calculate combat essential and support weather equipment as directed.
     Weather units tasked for TMQ-53 (TMOS) equipment not available or mission ready, will reflect
     shortfalls in the equipment and supplies/condition levels (S/R levels). Commanders may assess if they
     determine a Manual Observing System (MOS) kit will meet mission requirements of the TMQ-53.
     Remarks are required TMQ-53 shortfalls with forecast dates.

4.7. Equipment and Supplies O/H S-Level Calculations. To convert area percentages into an S-level
use the following rules:
     4.7.1. Aircraft units:
        4.7.1.1. Convert EQSEE field to an S-level by using Table 4.6.
        4.7.1.2. Convert EQSSE field to an S-level by using Table 4.7.
        4.7.1.3. Select the lower of EQSEE and EQSSE S-levels.
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                      89


       4.7.1.4. (Added-ACC) Report serviceable ECM pods. Serviceable is defined as those currently
       serviceable plus those that can be made serviceable in DOC response time. Submit a remark
       against "ESSA4" label listing the number of ECM pods on hand and mission ready. Use Table
       4.14. (Added) to determine S-level.
       4.7.1.5. (Added-ACC) As applicable: Report serviceable LANTIRN Navigation (NVP) and Tar-
       geting (TGP) pods as a percentage of the number of pods assigned. Report serviceable Harm Tar-
       geting System (HTS) pods as a percentage of the number of pods assigned. Serviceable is defined
       as those currently serviceable plus those that can be made serviceable in DOC response time.
       Enter this percentage in the appropriate ESSA column (ESSA6 for NVP, ESSA7 for TGP or
       HTS). Submit a remark against the appropriate ESSA label listing the number of ECM pods
       required (assigned for HTS), serviceable, and percentage. Use Table 4.15. (Added) to determine
       S-level.
   4.7.2. Non-aircraft units:
       4.7.2.1. Select the lowest percentage value from EQSEE and EQSSE percentages.
       4.7.2.2. Convert percentage into an equipment and supplies O/H S-level using Table 4.3.
   4.7.3. Note the derived equipment and supplies O/H S-level. If the S-level has changed since the last
   report, enter it in the ESRAT label. Use the Measured Resource Subarea Level for Equipment/Sup-
   plies O/H (ESRAF) for secondary or tertiary missions.
   4.7.4. If Table 4.1. lists nothing to report for the combat essential and support equipment O/H per-
   centages, report S-6 in ESRAT and SNM in ESRES.

4.8. Equipment and Supplies O/H Reason Codes. Select the most specific reason code from Table
4.5. when the equipment and supplies O/H S-level is less than S-1. Note the selected reason code. If the
reason code has changed since the last report, enter the new reason code in the label ESRES. Use the label
ESREF for secondary or tertiary missions.

4.9. Aircraft Sustainability Model (ASM) and Weapon System Management Information System
Sustainability Assessment Module (WSMIS-SAM). When the SORTS DOC Statement references
ASM or WSMIS-SAM units must use Table 4.9. to find the spares subarea percentage. MAJCOMs may
waive this requirement if there is a major problem with the ASM assessments. When there is a validated
problem with ASM, MAJCOMs may direct the use of WSMIS-SAM as a secondary or tertiary means of
providing an assessment of capability attributed to spare parts. The following rules apply for ASM and
WSMIS-SAM:
   4.9.1. No ASM or WSMIS-SAM available. If ASM or WSMIS-SAM is not available, and when
   authorized by MAJCOM, use the RSP (XD2 only) fill rate to report, using Table 4.9., rules 1-4.
   Report percentages in the RSP and ESSA1 fields. Enter an X in the ARUSD field.
   4.9.2. For units with strategic airlift aircraft (C-17, C-5, C-141), use percent SORTIES achieved over
   30 days (reference Table 4.9.).
       4.9.2.1. Enter Y in the ARUSD field.
       4.9.2.2. Report spares assessment percentage in ESSA1 field (reference Table 4.9.).
       4.9.2.3. Use fill rates to determine MRSP/IRSP and report in the RSP field.
90                                                           AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


     4.9.3. All other aircraft units (non-strategic airlift) use the aircraft availability spares assessment
     method (reference Table 4.9.).
        4.9.3.1. Enter Z in the ARUSD field.
        4.9.3.2. Report spares assessment percentage in ESSA1 field (reference Table 4.9.).
        4.9.3.3. Use fill rates to determine MRSP/IRSP and report in the RSP field.
     4.9.4. Guidance for specific aircraft availability (ACFTA) options to be used for each aircraft type is
     included in the notes to Table 4.9. Units will contact their MAJCOM office with any questions as to
     which ACFTA Option is appropriate.
     4.9.5. MAJCOMs will promptly notify HQ AFMC Logistics (HQ AFMC/LGXX) of specific model-
     ing disconnects with ASM. Notifications should be made within 48 hours of discovery, but not later
     than 72 hours.
     4.9.6. When ASM is used spare engine assessments will be made using Table 4.8. reporting the per-
     centage in the ESSA2 field. The ASM assessment does not include spare engines.
     4.9.7. (Added-ACC) Notify HQ ACC/A4LW if the ASM files from the Air Force Material Com-
     mand (AFMC) are determined to be invalid.

4.10. Non-Returnable Deployed Resources. Occasionally, a unit may own equipment that is required
to be left in the contingency AOR after unit personnel redeploy to their home station. Equipment defined
as non-deployable/non-returnable because of use in a particular AOR will be immediately reported as
non-available in the units SORTS report. Unit S-level will reflect the computations derived from lack of
specified equipment.
     4.10.1. MRSPs. MRSPs having SBSS MRSP details that are partially or totally transferred to either a
     MAJCOM Regional Supply Squadron (RSS) or to the deployed SBSS account are still the responsi-
     bility of the owning base for SORTS reporting.
     4.10.2. The owning LRS will contact the RSS or deployed account to obtain an R26 for the trans-
     ferred items and calculate these assets as available, if they can be redeployed within the response time.
     4.10.3. ASM will be used in conjunction with R26 merge program to assess the deployed unit’s
     MRSP (or mission support kit, MRSK, if partially deployed) along with the MRSPs at the home base
     for SORTS.

4.11. BEAR Base Equipment and Supplies O/H Measured Area. Required equipment and supplies
S-levels are based on critical equipment and MRSP authorized for items identified in the BEAR Base
SORTS Critical Item List, as applicable. Authorized suitable substitutes may be used. The BEAR Base
Critical Item List is produced by HQ Air Combat Command (ACC) Logistics and should be used to cal-
culate these levels.

4.12. Aircraft Engine Computations. These procedures are outlined in AFI 21-104, “Selective Man-
agement of Selected Gas Turbine Engines” and must be used to determine required war readiness engines.
Authorized additives, justified on the basis of wartime requirement, must be included in computations.
All aircraft with engine holes will have serviceable engines allocated. The number of net serviceable
spare engines will then be compared to the WRE requirement and the reported percentage is the factor to
be entered on the S-level checklist. Engines installed in or obligated to BAI, cannibalized (CANN), and
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                       91


unserviceable assigned aircraft, that are available within response time, may be considered by the unit
commander to subjectively upgrade the S-level. This can include engines projected available through the
pipeline, jet engine intermediate maintenance, or logistics support center provided that serviceability and
Ready For Issue (RFI) requirements are met.
   4.12.1. (Added-ACC) The ACC Propulsion Branch (HQ ACC/A4MP) will publish total Base Stock
   Level (BSL) spare engine authorizations and War Readiness Engine (WRE) levels annually. WRE
   and required engines are synonymous.
   4.12.2. (Added-ACC) For spare engine computation in ACC refer to note below Table 4.8.

NOTE: If 11 or more engines are required, compute and report the actual percentage available. This table
is used in conjunction with Table 4.7. Units reporting at squadron level, use the number of engines
required for the squadron. Units reporting at wing level, use the number of engines required for the wing.
These procedures are outlined in AFI 21-104 and must be used to determine required war readiness
engines. Authorized additives, justified on the basis of wartime requirement, must be included in compu-
tations. All aircraft with engine holes will have serviceable engines allocated. The number of net service-
able spare engines will then be compared to the WRE requirement and the reported percentage is the
factor to be entered on the Aircraft and Equipment and Supplies O/H S-level checklist. Engines installed
in or obligated to BAI, CANN, and unserviceable assigned aircraft, that are available within the response
time, may be considered by the unit commander to subjectively upgrade the S-level. This can include
engines projected available through the pipeline, jet engine intermediate maintenance, or a logistic sup-
port center provided that serviceability and RFI requirements are met.

                      EQUIPMENT CONDITION MEASURED AREA DATA

5.1. Equipment Condition Reporting. The equipment condition measured area is used to measure the
combat essential and support equipment that can be made ready within the unit’s response time to under-
take the unit’s assigned wartime mission. This measure is also used to indicate maintenance and equip-
ment reliability, serviceability and operational status of assets. Units compute the equipment condition
R-level for combat essential and support equipment based on the availability of wartime required equip-
ment. Equipment items are considered available if they are possessed by the unit and are, or can be, made
mission ready within the prescribed unit response time. The formula for equipment condition computation
is: the number of equipment items mission ready and available divided by the number possessed (not to
exceed the wartime requirement number) multiplied by 100.

5.2. Equipment Condition Subareas (ERSAs). The equipment condition measured area allows units to
measure up to nine subareas. Consider the following for all missions:
   5.2.1. Use SORTS DOC Statements, equipment lists, Air Staff-level functional area guidance, LOG-
   DET, AS’s, etc., as necessary, to determine equipment types; then measure the number possessed.
   5.2.2. Add number of items possessed for each subarea to obtain a subarea total.

5.3. Subarea Percentage Calculations. Determine the number of items mission ready and available for
each subarea. Accomplish the following:
   5.3.1. Add number of items MRA for each subarea to obtain a subarea total.
   5.3.2. Forecast the number of items that could be MRA by response time.
   5.3.3. Calculate the subarea percentages:
       5.3.3.1. If there are ten or more items possessed accomplish the following:
           5.3.3.1.1. Divide the number of items MRA by the number of items possessed.
           5.3.3.1.2. The number of items counted as possessed is not to exceed the number of items
           authorized.
           5.3.3.1.3. Multiply the result by 100 to derive a percentage.
           5.3.3.1.4. Round percentage to nearest whole number (this is the subarea percentage.)
       5.3.3.2. If there are nine or less items possessed select the appropriate percentage from Table 5.2.,
       unless Table 5.4. contains other instructions. Note the derived percentages. If a percentage has
       changed since the last report, enter the new percentage in the appropriate subarea label from Table
       5.4.
   5.3.4. (Added-ACC) Overall AIS cell capability will be calculated by dividing the total number of
   LRU types the test stations are currently capable of testing by the total number of LRU types the cell's
   test stations are designed to test.

      5.3.7. (Added-ACC) Ensure that the required systems or subsystems are operational using the Basic
      System List (BSL) of the DOCs MESL. Those units MESL listed in the work unit code (WUC) format
      will use the following basic system's list to determine MC status:
         5.3.7.1. (Added-ACC) Units assigned a conventional mission only. Any one of the tasked (as
         shown in the DOC) BSL.
         5.3.7.2. (Added-ACC) Units assigned to a nuclear and conventional mission. Any one of the
         tasked (as shown in the DOC) conventional BSLs plus the nuclear BSL.
      5.3.8. (Added-ACC) For generation tasked units, ensure adequate suspension equipment is available
      to perform the mission. For mobility units, ensure that sufficient suspension equipment can be
      deployed with the unit to support aircraft at deployed location. An aircraft must be MC and be config-
      ured within DOC response time or have available (if deployed on aircraft) the required suspension
      equipment in order to be Mission Ready Available (MRA) aircraft.
      5.3.9. (Added-ACC) Aircraft Systems. It is the responsibility of each unit to develop written local
      procedures to collect aircraft systems capability data for each possessed aircraft. The data will be col-
      lected by Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) personnel and consolidated into a summary report.
         5.3.9.1. (Added-ACC) As a minimum, collected data (by tail number) must consider the status of
         aircraft using the applicable DOC, MESL and AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, requirements.
         5.3.9.2. (Added-ACC) A distinct entry into the MOC monitoring system for suspension equip-
         ment applicable to each DOCID is required to ensure this vital element is considered in determin-
         ing MRA and forecasted aircraft status.
         5.3.9.3. (Added-ACC) An entry is required by the MOC that gives the current status and DOC
         response forecast status.
         5.3.9.4. (Added-ACC) Aircraft status and DOC response forecasts are based upon factors in AFI
         10-201, paragraph A2.8.2.2.1., full access to RSP, cannibalization, and any shortfalls caused by
         logistics personnel not being available due to mobilization actions required for deployment.
      5.3.10. (Added-ACC) When estimating generation capability of MRA aircraft, consider the majority
      (95% plus) of the maintenance work force is available for work; this applies to all units except
      dual-based units. Dual-based units have a reduced work force available according to individual
      deployment flow plans. All other units with mobility DOCs plan on a reduced work force after the
      first 24 hours according to unit mobility flow plans.

5.4. Combat Essential and Support Equipment Condition Percentage Calculations:
      5.4.1. Find the unit type in Table 5.1., Column A. Use Column B for combat essential equipment and
      Column C for support equipment.
      5.4.2. To calculate the combat essential and support equipment condition percentage for each area
      accomplish the following:
         5.4.2.1. If the entry lists subarea labels, select the lowest percentage for those subareas.
         5.4.2.2. If the entry lists equipment or another document, calculate the percentage with the same
         procedure used for subarea calculations.
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                       141


   5.4.3. Note the derived percentage. If the percentage has changed, enter the new percentage in the
   EQREE label for combat essential equipment or EQRED label for support equipment.
   5.4.4. Note the derived number of combat essential items. For aircraft units, determine the number of
   aircraft that are mission ready and available.
       5.4.4.1. If the number of aircraft that are mission ready and available has changed since the last
       report enter the new number in the label MEMRA.
       5.4.4.2. The number of aircraft reported in the labels MEASG, MEPOS, and MEMRA fields will
       not be greater than the number reported in the label MEARD.
       5.4.4.3. The actual number of aircraft authorized, possessed, and mission-ready and available is
       reported in the MEQLOCN set.

5.5. Equipment Condition R-Level Calculations.
   5.5.1. To convert area percentages into an R-level use the following rules:
       5.5.1.1. Select the lowest percentage value from the combat essential and support equipment con-
       dition area percentages.
       5.5.1.2. Aircraft units use Table 5.3. to convert the combat essential equipment condition percent-
       age into an R-level.
       5.5.1.3. Non-aircraft units use Table 5.6. to convert the equipment condition area percentage into
       an R-level.
   5.5.2. Note the derived equipment condition R-level. If the R-level has changed since the last report,
   enter the new R-level in the ERRAT label (Equipment Condition Measured Resource Area Category
   Subarea (ERRAF) label for secondary or tertiary missions).
   5.5.3. When an AF directed resource change depletes mission ready and available equipment, refer-
   ence paragraph 1.10.9.
   5.5.4. If Table 5.1. lists nothing to report for the combat essential equipment condition and support
   equipment condition percentages, report R-6 in ERRAT and RNM in ERRES (see paragraph 4.7.4.).

5.6. Equipment Condition Reason Codes.
   5.6.1. Select the most specific reason code from Table 5.5., when the equipment condition R-level is
   less than R-1.
   5.6.2. Note the selected reason code. If the reason code has changed since the last report, enter the
   new reason code in the ERRES or ERREF label.

5.7. Equipment Considered Mission Ready and Available (MRA). Most equipment is considered
mission ready if the equipment is safe to use and in the condition to perform the functions for which it was
designed.
   5.7.1. Aircraft, missiles, and major weapons systems must comply with the following:
       5.7.1.1. Have a full or basic system list of items for the stated working mission (MAJCOMs are
       the authority on which system to use).
142                                                           AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


         5.7.1.2. Be configured with suspension equipment (i.e., dash 21 items and alternate mission
         equipment) that is required by the MAJCOM.
         5.7.1.3. Have all peacetime inspections or time compliance technical order actions completed or
         waived for wartime use.
      5.7.2. In-Place Generation, Alert, or Surveillance Missions. Consider items available if the items will
      be ready at their duty location within response time.
         5.7.2.1. Consider strategic air defense aircraft available when these aircraft are within the United
         States or Canada.
         5.7.2.2. Consider strategic airlift aircraft on operational missions available regardless of their
         location.
         5.7.2.3. Consider strategic tankers on operational missions available if the aircraft will be ready to
         deploy within the response time.
      5.7.3. Mobility Missions. Consider items available, regardless of location, if the items are expected to
      be ready within response time. Equipment items left in a contingency AOR, while personnel reconsti-
      tute or redeploy, will be reported as non-available if equipment condition cannot be ascertained.
      5.7.4. Combined In-place Generation and Mobility Mission. Allocate equipment to each mission type
      and apply the guidelines for each specific mission type.
      5.7.5. Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03 Mission. Consider items available if the items are expected
      to be ready within response time.
      5.7.6. Equipment items loaned to another unit to augment their resources. Will be considered pos-
      sessed by the owning unit. Items will not be double counted. Receiving unit will not use these
      resources for SORTS reporting.

5.8. BEAR Base Equipment Condition Measured Area. Equipment condition R-levels are based on
fully mission capable critical equipment authorized for items identified in the BEAR Base Critical Item
List produced by HQ Air Combat Command (ACC) Logistics. Use the standard command checklists to
calculate this area.

5.9. Required Remarks for Aircraft Units. If referencing aircraft grounded for mission capable
(MICAP) parts, provide the National Stock Number (NSN), part nomenclature, and the name of the sys-
tem which needs the part. If the aircraft is unavailable due to scheduled or unscheduled maintenance, pro-
vide the Estimated Time in Commission (ETIC). Also provide the estimated delivery dates for aircraft
undergoing programmed depot maintenance. Labels for the remarks will be provided via MAJCOM sup-
plement.

NOTES:
  1. SHF SATCOM requires capability to receive incoming data, multiplex, modulate, up-link,
     down-link, demodulate, demultiplex, and transmit outgoing data using GMF SHF SATCOM.
      2. TROPO requires capability to receive incoming data, multiplex, modulate, transmit, receive,
         demodulate, demultiplex, and transmit outgoing data using TRC-170.
      3. Operating TSSR pair requires a transmit and receive capability at both ends of TSSR link.
      4. Tactical radio nets must have the capability to transmit and receive secure communications using
         high powered radios.

NOTES:
  1. Where different, values for US Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) CRCs are enclosed in parentheses.
     2. Compute maximum number of customers that could be supported by assigned telephone switch(es); considering available instruments,
        cable, j-boxes, termination units, switch capacity, central processing unit (CPU) function, and any other factor impacting service avail-
        ability.
     3. Consider ability to terminate one AUTODIN circuit (UGC-144, etc.)
     4. C2 channels require transmit and receive capability over radios in 4 OMs and external radios.
     5. SHF SATCOM requires capability to receive incoming data, multiplex, modulate, up-link, down-link, demodulate, demultiplex, and
        transmit outgoing data using TSC-100A GMF SHF SATCOM hub. Numbers of carriers are TSC-100A available.
     6. SHF SATCOM requires capability to receive incoming data, multiplex, modulate, up-link, down-link, demodulate, demultiplex, and
        transmit outgoing data using TSC-94A GMF SHF SATCOM.

   outgoing data using TRC-170.
8. Operating TSSR pair requires a transmit and receive capability at both ends of TSSR link.
9. Net control requires capability to automatically configure, monitor, test, and control circuits and trunks transitioning the facility using
   TSQ-111 or TSQ-188.
10. To compute multiplexing package capability divide available capability of assigned multiplexers (TSQ-146, FCC-100, RMC, etc.) by
    designed capability and multiply by 100.
11. Compute ERSA4 percentage by selecting lowest score of all areas measured herein. Where a rating crosses two scores, assume higher
    score unless driven lower by another rating (e.g. 1 TSC-100A Carrier). Where no criteria exists for an area, failure to meet minimum
    criteria will drive score no lower than minimum criteria noted (e.g. no message traffic capability = 70 percent).

NOTES:
  1. SCAMP requires operational terminal and ancillaries to provide secure data services.
      2. VHF/UHF requires functional transmit and receive capability using TRC-176, PRC-113 or simi-
         lar radio.
      3. HF requires functional secure voice transmit and receive capability using URC-119 or similar
         radio set.

     j-boxes, termination units, switch capacity, CPU function, and any other factors impacting service availability.
    2. Consider ability to terminate two DMS circuits (primary and alternate) at a record communications facility and two TCP.IP nets (NIPR-
       NET or SIPRNET).
    3. Operating RF Links requires a transmit and receive capability at both ends of the link.
    4. SHF SATCOM requires capability to receive incoming data, multiplex, modulate, uplink, downlink, demodulate, demultiplex, and
       transmit outgoing data using LMST, USC-60A, or DDT.
    5. Need to control requires the capability to automatically configure, monitor, test, and control circuits and trunks:
   a. Systems under Note 5b fully operational and sufficient other components to support TDC communication equipment as identified

      in the MISCAP.
   b. Facilities, processor, patch and test, timing subsystems, and automatic digital test (ADT) fully operational.
   c. Ability to manually configure, monitor, test, and control circuits and trunks using other facility.
6. Compute ERSA1, ERSA2, and ERSA3 percentage by selecting lowest score of all areas measured herein. Where no criteria exists for
   an area, failure to meet minimum criteria will drive the score no lower than the minimum criteria notes (e.g., no RF link capability =
   70%) unless driven lower by another area.

                                                Chapter 6

                               TRAINING MEASURED AREA DATA

6.1. Training. Training measurement is used to indicate the status of training needed to support the mis-
sion for which a unit is designed, as identified in the unit SORTS DOC Statement. Measured units will
calculate a training measured area T-level using either Training Method B (Crew Training) or Training
Method C, Option 1 (Unit Training) or Option 2 (CAF Aviation Unit Training).
   6.1.1. Option 1 is used to provide fidelity, flexibility, and a macro view of the unit’s training.
   6.1.2. Option 2 is used by CAF aviation units, command and control reporting units, and those
   assigned to a wing (89AA UTC - active duty only) with Aircrew Position Indicator (API) codes 1
   (pilot), 2 (navigator, observer or air battle manager), and A (career enlisted advisor (CEA)) plus 6, or
   B for CEA, (attached flyer at wing level and below) and 8, or D for CEA, (attached flyer above wing
   level) used to achieve WMP-5 sortie rates (e.g. Wing Safety, Tactics, STANEVAL, IG, etc.).
       6.1.2.1. Wing crews with RPI 6 and 8 attached to a squadron for training and wartime service are
       normally measured in the organization of assignment when tasked against that unit’s require-
       ments. Personnel resources cannot be counted against requirements in more than one unit.
       6.1.2.2. Weapons load crews (AFSC 2W1X1) are unique among maintenance personnel, in that
       they perform their duties as formed and certified crews with specialized certification requirements
       for each crew position. T-levels for 2W1X1 personnel, assigned to a weapons load crew, may be
       determined using Training Method B if and when it is allowed by current reporting structure and
       guidance.

6.2. Using Training Method B: Crew Training.
   6.2.1. Find the number of crews authorized or required.
       6.2.1.1. Aircraft units reporting against a mobility, SIOP, or combined in-place/generation and
       mobility mission:
           6.2.1.1.1. Check the MISCAP of the UTC listed in the SORTS DOC Statement for crew ratio
           or use crew ratio listed in AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, Attachment
           36-1, separated by aircraft type.
           6.2.1.1.2. For each UTC, multiply the crew ratio by the primary mission aircraft inventory
           (PMAI) authorization on the SORTS DOC Statement to get the number of crews required.
           Add the separate UTC amounts together to get the total number of crews required.
       6.2.1.2. Aircraft units reporting against an in-place/generation or alert mission:
           6.2.1.2.1. Check AFI 65-503 to determine the crew ratio associated with the unit’s aircraft
           type.
           6.2.1.2.2. Multiply the crew ratio by the PMAI authorization on the SORTS DOC Statement
           to get the number of crews authorized.
       6.2.1.3. The AF Space Training manager in coordination with the AF Space FAM will ensure
       space operations unit crew requirements are set and based on unit DOCs.
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                    193


     6.2.1.4. Aeromedical evacuation unit crew requirements are determined by adding together the
     number of crew UTCs tasked to the unit.
     6.2.1.5. If the number of crews has changed since the last report, enter the change under the
     TCARQ label.
     6.2.1.6. Weapons load crew requirements are determined by adding the number of crews tasked
     by aviation UTCs or for SIOP generation (if applicable).
  6.2.2. Find the number of crews assigned.
     6.2.2.1. For aircraft units, use AFI 65-503 for crew composition unless modified by the MAJ-
     COM because of unique mission requirements.
     6.2.2.2. All other units, use Table 6.1. for crew composition.
     6.2.2.3. Weapons load crew composition is determined IAW AFI 21-101.
     6.2.2.4. To count a crew as assigned, each position must have an assigned crewmember. Do not
     limit this to by-name formed crews such as those required by AFI 65-503. Count crewmembers as
     assigned from when they sign in on a permanent change of station until they sign out.
     6.2.2.5. If the number of crews has changed since the last report, enter the change under the
     TCRAS label. Total crews assigned may not exceed total crews authorized or required.
         6.2.2.5.1. Count weapons load crew members as assigned once they are designated to a posi-
         tion and have entered initial weapons load crew training.
         6.2.2.5.2. Standardized load crews (SLC), assigned to weapons standardization, will be
         apportioned equally to flying squadrons for determining assigned load crews.
  6.2.3. Count the number of crews mission ready and available.
     6.2.3.1. Count a crew mission ready and available (MRA) when all positions are filled with MRA
     crewmembers.
         6.2.3.1.1. If they meet the mission ready criteria in the training directive listed in the SORTS
         DOC Statement.
         6.2.3.1.2. Determine crewmember availability case-by-case according to paragraph 3.2.
         6.2.3.1.3. Do not count overhead crewmembers (e.g., wing training officers, etc.).
     6.2.3.2. Enter the total of crews MRA under the TCRAV label.
     6.2.3.3. Count weapons load crews as mission ready and available when all positions are filled
     with position-certified weapons loaders IAW AFI 21-101 and the Unit Committed Munitions List.
  6.2.4. Calculate the training percentage.
     6.2.4.1. If ten or more crews are assigned, divide crews MRA by crews assigned. Multiply the
     result by 100 and round off to the nearest whole number.
     6.2.4.2. Table 6.3. will be used to determine the overall T-level.
     6.2.4.3. If nine or less crews are assigned use Table 6.2.
     6.2.4.4. Enter the percentage under the TRUTC label.

6.3. Using Training Method C, Option 1 - Unit Training. Use this training method to report subareas
specified on the SORTS DOC Statement for the unit types in Table 6.4.
   6.3.1. Determine the number of personnel required to have the training specified in each subarea.
   Some units may have more personnel assigned than are authorized by UMD or required by UTC. All
   individuals must be trained, but not all may be measured in the training measured area. Using Method
   C, Option 1, the number you establish as assigned requiring training may not exceed UMD-authorized
   or UTC-required total personnel.
       6.3.1.1. If a single type of training is listed, determine if everyone is required to have it.
           6.3.1.1.1. If everyone is required to have the training, use the number of total personnel
           assigned as the number required to be trained.
           6.3.1.1.2. If everyone is not required to have the training, use the number of total personnel
           assigned that require the training, (e.g. 25K/40K aerial port training).
       6.3.1.2. If there is more than one type of training listed, (e.g. chemical warfare and weapons),
       determine if everyone is required to have the training.
           6.3.1.2.1. If everyone is required to have the training, use the total personnel assigned as the
           number required to be trained. (Consider limitations in paragraph 6.3.1.)
           6.3.1.2.2. If less than all assigned personnel are required to have each type of training, add
           together the number required for each type of training. This number could be more than the
           number of personnel requiring training.
   6.3.2. Count the personnel who have the training specified in each subarea.
       6.3.2.1. Personnel are counted as trained if they have completed, or are expected to complete, the
       required training within the response time.
       6.3.2.2. If everyone is required to have all training, count only those personnel who have all the
       training.
       6.3.2.3. If personnel are required to have each type of training, count those personnel who have
       received each type of training. In this method, you can count the same individual more than once.
       To determine the T-level, continue with paragraph 6.5.
   6.3.3. Table 6.3. will be used to determine the overall T-level.

6.4. Using Training Method C, Option 2: CAF Aviation Unit Training.
   6.4.1. Calculations by type of training and crew composition will be compared against the percentage
   conversion Table 6.6., Table 6.7., and Table 6.8. to derive the percentages reported in the specific
   TRSAs. The lowest of the resulting TRSAs will drive the T-level reported in the TRRAT label in the
   OVERALL set.
   6.4.2. As a minimum, the following three training events will be measured. All five subareas may be
   used depending on MAJCOM requirements. If TRSA 4 and 5 are used, enter as in paragraph 6.5.4.
       6.4.2.1. TRSA1 - Basic Mission Capable (BMC).
       6.4.2.2. TRSA2 - Combat Mission Ready (CMR).
       6.4.2.3. TRSA3 - Special Capability (SPECAP).
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                   195


  6.4.3. To count a crew as assigned, each position must have an assigned crewmember. However,
  don't limit this to by-name formed crews such as those required by appropriate training directives for
  the weapon system. Count crewmembers as assigned from when they sign in on a permanent change
  of station or become attached on temporary duty until they sign out.
  6.4.4. Single Position Crews:
     6.4.4.1. Assess crews for training subareas the unit is required to report.
         6.4.4.1.1. Determine the number of required BMC/Mission Capable (MC) designated crew-
         members, assigned and attached to the unit, and the minimum crew required based on
         non-CMR flying positions within the wing and its subordinate units. If the BMC changes,
         detail the changes in a TRSA1 remark.
         6.4.4.1.2. Determine the number of required CMR/Mission Ready (MR) designated crew
         members, assigned and attached to the unit, and the minimum crew required based on the
         PMAI specified by the SORTS DOC Statement.
             6.4.4.1.2.1. Multiply the PMAI by the crew ratio.
             6.4.4.1.2.2. Add the Squadron Commander and Director of Operations (DO) (ANG/
             AFRC only).
             6.4.4.1.2.3. If the CMR changes, detail the changes in a TRSA2 remark.
         6.4.4.1.3. Determine the number of required SPECAP designated crew members, assigned
         and attached to the unit, and the minimum crew required based on all positions identified in
         the SORTS DOC Statement, applicable training directives, and ready aircrew program tasking
         messages that specify special capability-trained aircrews. Calculations will be made only on
         those SPECAP requirements that match those listed in Table 2.3. MAJCOMs may add to this
         table when approved by HQ USAF/XOOT. Commanders may assess other SPECAP shortfalls
         when they affect his ability to undertake his DOC mission. If the SPECAP changes, detail the
         changes in a TRSA3 remark.
  6.4.5. Multi-Position Crews:
     6.4.5.1. Assess crews for training subareas the unit is required to report.
         6.4.5.1.1. Units with multi-position crews will perform calculations similar to single position
         crews except against each crew position individually. This is required before TRSA, TRUTC,
         and T-level percentages can be determined.
         6.4.5.1.2. Determine the number of required BMC designated crewmembers, assigned or
         attached to the unit, in each duty position, based on the non-CMR flying positions within the
         wing and its subordinate units. If the BMC changes, detail the changes in a TRSA1 remark.
         6.4.5.1.3. Determine the number of required CMR/MR designated crewmembers, assigned
         and attached to the unit, in each duty position, based on the PMAI specified by the SORTS
         DOC Statement.
             6.4.5.1.3.1. Multiply the PMAI by the crew ratio.
             6.4.5.1.3.2. Add the Squadron Commander and DO (ANG/AFRC only).
             6.4.5.1.3.3. If the CMR changes, detail the changes in a TRSA2 remark.
196                                                        AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


              6.4.5.1.3.4. For Air Control Squadrons, determine the number of required CMR/MR des-
              ignated crewmembers, assigned and attached to the unit, in each position, based on the
              UTC manpower requirements.
          6.4.5.1.4. Determine the number of required SPECAP designated crewmembers, assigned and
          attached to the unit, in each duty position, based on all positions identified in the SORTS DOC
          Statement, applicable training directives, and tasking messages that specify special capabil-
          ity-trained aircrews. Calculations will be made only on those SPECAP requirements that
          match those listed in Table 2.3. MAJCOMs may add to this table when approved by HQ
          USAF/XOOT. Commanders may assess other SPECAP shortfalls when they affect his ability
          to undertake his DOC mission. If the SPECAP changes, detail the changes in a TRSA3
          remark.

6.5. Calculating and Explaining the Training T-Level
   6.5.1. Training Method C, Option 1: Unit Training, determine T-level using the following:
      6.5.1.1. Calculate the subarea percentage using applicable tables, as required. Otherwise:
          6.5.1.1.1. If ten or more personnel are required to have the training, divide the number of
          trained personnel by the number of assigned personnel required to have the training (not to
          exceed the wartime required number).
          6.5.1.1.2. Multiply the result by 100 to derive a percentage.
          6.5.1.1.3. Round the percent to the nearest whole number.
          6.5.1.1.4. If nine or less personnel are required to have the training, use Table 6.2. to deter-
          mine the percentage.
      6.5.1.2. Calculate the training percentage. Determine the unit type in Table 6.4. in column A.
      Across from the unit type in column B, determine whether the entry lists subarea labels.
          6.5.1.2.1. If the entry lists subarea labels, choose the lowest subarea percentage as the area
          percentage.
          6.5.1.2.2. If the entry lists types of training or another document, calculate an area percentage
          using the same procedure as for a subarea.
          6.5.1.2.3. If changed since the last report, enter the percentage in the TRUTC label.
      6.5.1.3. Use the TRUTC percentage in conjunction with Table 6.3. to determine the T-level to be
      reported in the TRRAT field. Use the Measured Resource Area Level for Training (TRRAF) for
      Secondary or Tertiary Missions.
   6.5.2. Training Method B: Crew Training, determine T-level using the following:
      6.5.2.1. If ten or more assigned, divide the number of crews mission ready and available by the
      number of assigned (not to exceed the wartime required number). Multiply the result by 100 and
      round off to a whole number.
      6.5.2.2. If nine or less assigned, use Table 6.1.
      6.5.2.3. If the percentage of crews changed since the last report, enter the change in the TRUTC
      label.
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                   197


  6.5.3. Training Method C, Option 2: Single Position Crews, use the following to determine the
  T-level:
     6.5.3.1. Calculate the percentage trained for each subarea required to be reported.
         6.5.3.1.1. For nine or less crews assigned, use Table 6.2. to derive percentage trained.
         6.5.3.1.2. For ten or more crews assigned, divide number trained by number assigned.
     6.5.3.2. Apply each resulting percentage against column A of the corresponding training table
     (BMC/Table 6.6., CMR/Table 6.7., and SPECAP/Table 6.8.).
     6.5.3.3. Convert the column A percentage into the column B reported percentage.
     6.5.3.4. Enter percentage in the related TRSA label: BMC in TRSA1; CMR in TRSA2; and SPE-
     CAP in TRSA3. If TRSA 4 and 5 are used, enter as in paragraph 6.5.1.
     6.5.3.5. Choose the lowest TRSA reported and enter the percentage in the TRUTC label.
     6.5.3.6. Use the TRUTC percentage in conjunction with Table 6.6., Table 6.7., and Table 6.8. to
     determine the T-level to be reported in the TRRAT label. Use TRRAF for Secondary or Tertiary
     Missions.
  6.5.4. For Training Method C, Option 2: Multi-position crews, use the following to determine the
  T-level:
     6.5.4.1. Calculate the percentage trained for each subarea required to be reported.
         6.5.4.1.1. For nine or less crews assigned, use Table 6.2. to derive percentage trained.
         6.5.4.1.2. For ten or more crews assigned, divide number trained by number assigned.
     6.5.4.2. Apply each resulting percentage against column A of the corresponding training table
     (BMC/Table 6.3., CMR/Table 6.4., and SPECAP/Table 6.5.).
     6.5.4.3. Convert the corresponding percentage in column B.
     6.5.4.4. Enter the percentage in the related TRSA label: BMC in TRSA1; CMR in TRSA2; and
     SPECAP in TRSA3. If TRSA 4 and 5 are used, enter as in 6.5.1.
     6.5.4.4. (ACC) Training Measured Area. ACC provided Ready Aircrew Shadow worksheets or
     an approved facsimile will be used to calculate these areas. ACC Training Method-C Option 2
     reporting units are also required to review specific ACC MDS RAP Directives for specifics on
     BMC/CMR/SPECAP reporting requirements. Once the specific worksheet areas are computed,
     configure the applicable areas of AFSORTSDET to reflect TRSA1, TRSA2, and/or TRSA3 data
     to derive a T-Level. See Table 6.14. (Added), Table 6.15. (Added), and Table 6.16. (Added).
     6.5.4.5. Choose the lowest TRSA reported and enter the percentage in the TRUTC label.
     6.5.4.6. Use the TRUTC percentage in conjunction with Table 6.6., Table 6.7., and Table 6.8. to
     determine the T-level to be reported in the TRRAT label. Use TRRAF for Secondary or Tertiary
     Missions.
  6.5.5. Regardless of option used, assign training reason codes when the training T-level is less than
  T-1. Select the most specific reason code from Table 6.5. to explain it. If changed, enter it in label
  TRRES. Use TRREF for Secondary or Tertiary Missions.

   6.5.6. For units that conduct required training and must use alternate workaround facilities or meth-
   ods due to environmental restrictions on normal exercise or major training range areas, commanders
   should note this limitation through a TRRAT or TRSA remark and indicate an appropriate reason
   code from Table 6.5.

6.6. Forms Prescribed: The following prescribed form may be obtained through normal distribution
channels or through a facsimile computer-generated version. Air Force Form 723, SORTS DOC State-
ment.

   3. Rule 15 BMC, CMR and SPECAP subcategories apply only to Rule 15, Combat Air Forces.
   4. Rule 19 For those units with a Combat Camera (COMCAM) or Visual Information (VI) mobility
      mission, members must complete the COMCAM Contingency Support course at least once. Such
      training is considered valid as long as the member is assigned to subsequent COMCAM or VI
      units. Assignment outside such a mobility environment not including extended TDYs, short tours
      or specialized training under one year nullifies currency of this training, requiring the member to
      re-accomplish. COMCAM and/or VI unit commanders may, at their discretion, choose to send
      members to the training beyond the minimum requirement as readiness dictates. Air Force Air-
      crew Survival Training (for appropriately qualified aircrew personnel) may substitute for the
      COMCAM Contingency Support course, consistent with the rules described above.
   5. Rule 12 Training must include a command approved ABDR; engineer, general assessor, technical
      course, and support at least one CLSS field exercise (Hardstand) as an engineer.
   6. Rule 43 TACS will be considered current if they meet all air-strike control currency requirements
      to include Night, Live, Laser, and basic TAC requisites (IAW AFI 13-112, Vol 1).
   7. Rule 43 Units will include TRUTC remark to report the total number of combat mission ready
      JTACS broken out by officer and enlisted numbers.
   8. Rule 32a Aircraft assigned and directly support aircraft operations; excludes nuclear support
      equipment.
   9. Rule 32b Munitions service-level and theater swing-stock support activity (non-aircraft; even if
      stocks support aircraft; theater hubs, STAMP, TARP)

AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                      251


Employment—Employment involves the tactical use of aircraft in a desired area of operation. In airlift
operations it is the movement of forces into or within a combat zone or objective area, usually in the
assault phase. Also, it is the strategic, operational, or tactical use of forces and materiel in an area or
theater of operations.
Equipment—In logistics, all non-expendable items needed to outfit or equip an individual or
organization.
Equipment and Supplies On-Hand—Equipment that is possessed by the unit. When equipment is

Air Reserve Components (ARC). Strength accountability for persons on EAD changes from ARC to the
active forces. Members do not receive credit for active duty training and active duty in a service academy
or armed forces preparatory school.
Force Protection—Security programs designed to protect Service members, civilian employees, family
members, facilities, information, and equipment, in all locations and situations, accomplished through
planned and integrated application of combating terrorism, physical security, operations security,

authorization documents and central to its ability to undertake its mission (e.g. an F-16 to an F-16
squadron or transportable communications equipment to a combat communications squadron).
Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging System (MEFPAK)—A d a t a s y s t e m d e s i g n e d t o
support contingency and general war planning with predefined standardized manpower and equipment
force packages. MEFPAK, which operates in the command and control environment, is composed of two
subsystems: the Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) and the Logistics Force Packaging
System (LOGFOR).
Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR)—The MEFPAK component which provides: The
title of the unit or force element and its unique Joint Chiefs of Staff unit type code. The capability
statement containing the definition of unit capability. The manpower detail by function, grade (officers
only) and Air Force specialty code required to meet the defined capability.
Measured Units—Air Force active duty, Reserve, and Air National Guard units that are registered in
SORTS with a unit descriptor code (UDC) which identifies the unit as combat, combat support, or combat
service support.
Measured Units (Reporting Units)—All planned and actual JTF HQs, combat, combat support and
combat service support units of the operating forces, including Active duty, AF Reserve, and Air National
Guard, and provisional units apportioned to or deployed in support of a CJCS or combatant
command-directed OPLAN, CONPLAN, SIOP, Service war planning document or assigned in the
“Forces For Unified Commands” document are designated as measured units (units that report SORTS).
Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP)—A short paragraph associated with each UTC that describes
significant employment information. The MISCAP briefly explains mission capability, and states the
types of bases to which a unit can be deployed (i.e., BEAR base, standby deployment base, or limited
operating base).
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)—Training required to achieve a basic level of competence in a
unit’s primary tasked mission; a prerequisite for CMR and BMC status.
Mission Ready and Available (MRA) Aircraft—MRA aircraft have operational full system list (FSL)
or basic system list (BSL) items for the stated mission and are available within the response time. The
aircraft are configured with required suspension equipment, weapons are uploaded, servicing is
completed, and pre-flights are done. The major command determines which list will be used, which items
are required, and the aircraft configuration.
Mission Ready and Available Crews—Primary duty crews who are mission ready and available to
undertake the unit's specified wartime tasking. The measured unit commander determines crew
availability.
Mission Ready and Available Equipment—Equipment that is available and in condition to perform the
functions for which designed within the response time.

AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                      253


Mobility Mission—A wartime mission for which the measured unit will normally mobilize and deploy to
another area of operation prior to employment.
Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSP)—An air transportable package of war reserve materiel
spares, repair parts, and related maintenance supplies required to support planned wartime or contingency
operations of a weapon or support system for a specified period of time pending re-supply. MRSP may
support aircraft, vehicles, communications systems, and other systems as appropriate.
Notional Tasking—The condition of being prepared to execute a mission set against a planned
requirement that is in fact not tasked, but representative of a probable task in contingency or deliberate
planning actions. Units sourced to the Air Force War and Mobilization Plan against apportioned
requirements that are not currently tasked to any OPLAN, CONPLAN, or OPERATIONS PLAN 8044
REVISION 03 are notionally tasked to be able to deliver their Designed Operational Capability within
their response time if allocated to a crisis or sourced to a TPFDD.
Operational Control (OPCON)—Transferable command authority that may be exercised by
commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is inherent
in Combatant Command (command authority) and is the authority to perform those functions of
command over subordinate forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning
tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission.
Operating Location (OL)—Part of a unit that is geographically separated from its parent unit. It is used
to account for personnel by location. Personnel remain assigned to the parent unit so the command
supervision or other features provided by a detachment are not needed. An OL has none of the
administrative attributes of a unit.
Operation Plan—A plan for a single or series of connected operations to be carried out simultaneously
or in succession. It is usually based upon stated assumptions and is in the form of directive employed by
higher authority to permit subordinate commanders to prepare supporting plans and orders. The
designation “plan” is usually used instead of “order” in preparing for operations well in advance. An
operation plan may be put into effect at a prescribed time, or on signal, and then becomes and operation
order (CJCSM 3150.02, Global Status of Resources and Training System (GSORTS)). Any plan, except
for the Single Integrated Operational Plan (OPERATIONS PLAN 8044 REVISION 03), for the conduct
of military operations. Plans are prepared by Combatant Commanders in response to requirements
established by the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff and by commanders of subordinate commands in
response to requirements tasked by the establishing unified commander. Operation plans (OPLANs) are
prepared in either complete format of an OPLAN, or as a concept plan (CONPLAN).
- OPLAN is an operation plan for the conduct of joint operations that can be used as a basis for developing
an OPORD. An OPLAN identifies the forces and supplies required to execute the combatant
commander’s Strategic Concept and a movement schedule of these resources to the theater of operations.
The forces and supplies are identified in time-phased force and deployment data (TPFDD) files. OPLANs
will include all phases of the tasked operation. The plan is prepared with the appropriate annexes,
appendixes, and TPFDD files as described in the JOPES manuals containing planning policies,
procedures, and formats.
- CONPLAN is an operation plan in an abbreviated format that would require considerable expansion or
alteration to convert it into an OPLAN or OPORD. A CONPLAN contains the combatant commander’s
strategic concept and those annexes and appendixes deemed necessary by the combatant commander to
complete planning. Generally, detailed support requirements are not calculated and TPFDD files are not
prepared. Operational control includes authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and
254                                                          AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


joint training necessary to accomplish missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be
exercised through the commanders of subordinate organizations; normally this authority is exercised
through the Service component commanders. Operational control normally provides full authority to
organize commands and forces and to employ those forces as the commander in operational control
considers necessary to accomplish assigned missions. Operational control does not, in and of itself,
include authoritative direction for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization,
or unit training.
Organic Equipment—Equipment authorized, required, and under the direct control of the unit.
Overhead Crew—A person or a group of people assigned or attached to the organization in a status other
than that of primary duty crew (e.g., wing training officers, safety officers, maintenance officers, etc.)
who maintain mission ready status. Overhead crewmembers WILL NOT be counted in the personnel or
training C-level calculations. They may be assessed subjectively in the unit’s
Overall C-level —Commanders of measured units and operations officers who maintain mission ready
status may be counted in the personnel and training C-level calculations.
Pacing Item—An individual line item whose shortage more closely reflects support capability rather than
overall fill rates.
Possessed Aircraft—Aircraft for which actual responsibility has been given to a measured unit for
operational use. Aircraft temporarily absent but remaining under the operational control (OPCON) of the
measured unit are considered possessed aircraft. This includes aircraft possessed by a unit’s supporting
maintenance facilities until the aircraft are lost from the unit according to AFI 21-103, Equipment
Inventory, Status and Utilization Reporting.
Possessed Equipment—Equipment for which the measured unit has been given actual responsibility
according to applicable supply regulations for operational use.
Primary Air Force Specialty Code—The awarded AFSC in which an airman is most highly qualified to
perform duty.

mission. The primary authorization forms the basis for the allocation of operating resources to include
manpower, support equipment, and flying hour funds (CJCSM 3150.02, Global Status of Resources and
Training System (GSORTS)).
Primary Duty Crewmember—A person assigned or attached to a measured unit for the explicit
purposes of operating that unit’s primary mission weapon system.
Primary Mission—The wartime mission that is most resource demanding. The only exception is when a
unit has a less resource demanding mission of higher priority (e.g., OPERATIONS PLAN 8044
REVISION 03).
Registered Units—Units that have the potential to support, by deployment or otherwise, a CJCS or
combatant command-directed operations plan, contingency plan, Single Integrated Operations Plan , or
contingency operation. These units (which do not report SORTS) are registered in GSORTS through the
BIDE and ORGLOCN sets.
Reporting Units—All combat, combat support, and combat service support units, including Active,
National Guard or Reserve units sourced to an operations plan (OPLAN), contingency plan (CONPLAN),
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                    255

in the Armed Forces (CJCSM 3150.02, ) Global Status of Resources and Training System (GSORTS)).
War and Mobilization Plan (WMP)—The Air Force supporting plan to the Joint Strategic Capabilities
Plan. The six volumes of the WMP extends through the Six Year Defense Program to provide continuity
in short and mid-range war and mobilization planning. It provides current planning cycle policies and
planning factors for the conduct and support of wartime operations. It establishes requirements for
development of mobilization and production-planning programs to support sustained contingency
operations of the programmed forces. The WMP encompasses all functions necessary to match facilities,
manpower, and material with planned wartime activity (AFDD 1-2, Air Force Glossary).
War Reserve Material (WRM)—Material required, in addition to mobility equipment, RSP, and

                DESIGNED OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY (DOC) STATEMENT
                (AF FORM 723 OR APPROVED FACSIMILE) DEVELOPMENT

A2.1. Designed Operational Capability Statements. A SORTS DOC Statement identifies a measured
unit and references the unit’s wartime mission(s). Its purpose is to provide a summary of the mission for
which a unit is organized or designed (or equipped, when tasked). The SORTS DOC Statement is a hard
copy management tool used to describe a unit’s mission and provides details for its SORTS measurement
criteria. SORTS DOC Statements are not used as a tasking source. SORTS DOC Statements list resources
and training requirements based on WMP-1, 3, and 5, command instructions, OPLANS, CONPLANS,
and other AF or MAJCOM directives. All reporting units are provided a primary SORTS DOC Statement
that is designed to assist them to report C-level status to satisfy JCS SORTS requirements. Additionally,
units may be provided other subordinate missions on their DOC Statement, by the MAJCOM, to satisfy
unique requirements. See Chapter 1 for policy on writing SORTS DOC Statements.
   A2.1.1. DOC Statements will be developed using an AFF 723 or an approved computer generated
   facsimile.
   A2.1.2. Sections of the SORTS DOC Statement (AF Form 723). A unit SORTS DOC Statement is
   divided into six sections: Unit Identification, Mission Identification, Measured Resources Areas
   (MSRA), Amplifying Notes, Gaining Command list, and Coordination/Review.
       A2.1.2.1. Section I, Unit Identification, includes the measured unit ANAME, HOGEO, a repre-
       sentative UTC of the unit type named on the DOC, and the six-character UIC. This section also
       includes the DOC Mission Title, DOCID, and Geographic Location Code (GEOLOC).
       A2.1.2.2. Section II, Mission Identification, includes a mission tasking narrative and mission spe-
       cifics (i.e., response time and source, aircraft and missile mission-design-series (MDS), planning
       UTCs the unit is required to support for the unit’s mission(s), direct support units’ UICs,
       ANAME, and OPLAN(s) to which the unit is sourced to support). For weapon systems with a
       range of sortie rates and duration listed in the WMP-5, specify the single sortie rate and duration
       highlighted for planning purposes as the wartime flying scenario for SORTS in a unit SORTS
       DOC Statement, Section II, Part B.
       A2.1.2.3. Section III, MSRAs, will include the required measured resource areas.
           A2.1.2.3.1. Section IIIA, Personnel. MAJCOM FAMs will determine if the Total Personnel
           MSRA is determined using the UMD or only UTCs IAW paragraph 3.1. Additionally, they
           provide packets for packet methodology of measuring Critical Personnel (included in Table
           3.1.). Use of the packet methodology can allow shortfalls to be more visible within SORTS.
           A2.1.2.3.2. Section IIIB, Equipment and Supplies O/H. The Equipment and Supplies O/H
           MSRA section lists the combat essential and/or support equipment and supplies that the unit is
           required to measure in SORTS. MAJCOM FAMs may use a packet methodology for measur-
           ing equipment and supplies O/H when included as subarea measurements (ESSAs) in tables
           listed in Chapter 4. Use of the packet methodology allows shortfalls to be more visible within
           SORTS. This section also includes space for additional remarks.
           A2.1.2.3.3. Section IIIC, Equipment Condition. The Equipment Condition MSRA section
           lists the combat and/or support equipment the unit is required to measure and report in

             SORTS. MAJCOM FAMs may use a packet methodology to measure equipment condition
             when included as subarea measurements (ERSAs) in Chapter 5 tables. Use of the packet
             methodology allows shortfalls to be more visible within SORTS. This section also includes
             space for additional remarks.
             A2.1.2.3.4. Section IIID, Training. Air Force units use either Training Method B or C. Train-
             ing Method C is comprised of two options, Option 1 and 2. Option 1 is used to report unit
             training. All Active, Reserve, and National Guard units with a CAF mission will use Option 2
             to support the Ready Aircrew Program (RAP). Method B is used by aviation units outside
             CAFs. This section also includes space for additional remarks.
         A2.1.2.4. Section IV of the SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723) provides space for amplifying
         notes. Amplifying notes further guide unit SORTS monitors and commanders in understanding
         the scope of the desired SORTS report and additional details required accomplishing the report.
         A2.1.2.5. Section V, Gaining Commands. Lists initial AF gaining commands if the unit is to be
         under OPCON of another command after mobilization.
         A2.1.2.6. Section VI, Coordination and Review. Coordination blocks will be used for initial
         SORTS DOC Statement issue to capture interested parties’ concurrence and the review blocks for
         annual review.
      A2.1.3. (Added-ACC) DOC Statements are developed, reviewed, and revised by ACC FAMs and
      managed by HQ ACC/A3XR. When a unit’s tasking changes, a new DOC statement may be required.
      Functional managers will begin preparing new DOC statements as soon as possible. Units will con-
      tinue to use current DOC statement as the unit specific SORTS measurement criteria. Differences in
      new tasking criteria and current DOC statements will be reflected in appropriate remarks. If the new
      criterion affects overall unit C-level, the commander must subjectively assess until receipt of an
      updated DOC statement. Receipt of approved DOC statement constitutes an order to report in
      SORTS.
      A2.1.4. (Added-ACC) DOC Statements will be classified using derivative classification guidance
      from Executive Order 12958 and JCSI 1.03-3.
      A2.1.5. (Added-ACC) Responsibility for DOC Statements. HQ ACC FAMs are the office of pri-
      mary responsibility (OPR) for DOC statement content. FAMs are responsible for the currency and
      accuracy of ACC and ACC-gained unit DOC statements, and for the units that fall under their func-
      tional area of expertise. Use AFI 10-201, Table 1.1., for area functional counterpart at Air Staff. The
      OPR for policy concerning DOC statements is HQ ACC/A3XR.
      A2.1.6. (Added-ACC) Converting Units. Ensuring effective date and delivery of the DOC statement
      to the unit will be NLT 1 month prior to the end of the equipment quarter as established in the appli-
      cable ACC programming directive.
      A2.1.7. (Added-ACC) Activating Units. Ensuring effective date of unit's DOC statement will be the
      date the unit is scheduled to activate. Ensure the unit has been added to the BIDE by HQ ACC/A3XR.
      A SORTS report is required (by the unit) to reach the Defense Information System Agency
      (GSORTS) database within 24 hours from the effective date. The unit is required, as directed by the
      functional manager, to report C-5 until the unit has reached Initial Operational Capability (IOC).
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                       259


   A2.1.8. (Added-ACC) Inactivating Units. Deactivating units will not receive a new or revised DOC
   statement. A downgrade in C-status is expected during de-activations. FAM will initiate and coordi-
   nate a rescission message for DOC statements through HQ ACC/A3XR.

A2.2. Units Required To Have A SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723 or approved facsimile). N o t
every unit in the Air Force is required to have a SORTS DOC Statement. Units tasked against an OPLAN,
Concept Plans, Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03, or have standard UTCs coded as simultaneously avail-
able for deployment under war time surge conditions (DWS or DWX), or other tasking documents, are
required to have SORTS DOC Statements. Applicable units will report SORTS regardless of whether cur-
rently in plans or available to be included in these plans. Provisional or task organized units will be pro-
vided a SORTS DOC Statement when they are required to report. Aircraft/Non-Aircraft-Combat units or
separately deployable DETs, Aircraft-Combat Support Elements, Non-aircraft-Combat Support Ele-
ments, and Combat Service Support Elements listed in Table A2.1. must possess a valid SORTS DOC
Statement.
A2.2. (ACC) Units Required to Have a SORTS DOC Statement (AF Form 723 or Approved Fac-
simile). DOC Statements are a SORTS reporting tool and are not used to establish, organize, design, or
task units. UTC AVAILABILITY LISTING, Mission Need Statements, Operations Requirements Docu-
ments, Allowance Standard, Unit Manpower Documents, etc., serve these functions. Functional managers
will not use DOC statement as a tool to acquire funding for a mission(s) they desire to have at execution.
UTCs should be written against resources that a unit is already designed to accomplish. These resources
should then be funded and fielded in the unit.
   A2.2.1. Permanently separated DETs planning to be geographically separated from their parent unit
   will act as measured units and report their own C-level data. These units will have an independent
   PAS code. OLs A, B, etc. will be included in the SORTS DOC Statement and SORTS report of their
   parent unit, when appropriate.
   A2.2.2. DOC Statements must be provided to units as soon as possible after the unit is activated by
   the publication of G-series orders. Units must start reporting in conjunction with the effective date of
   the DOC Statement. The DOC Statement remains in force until the unit is inactivated by the publica-
   tion of a G-Series order.

A2.3. Single and Multiple SORTS DOC Statements (AFF 723 or approved facsimile). M o s t u n i t s
will have only one SORTS DOC Statement called the Primary Mission SORTS DOC Statement. The Pri-
mary Mission SORTS DOC Statement encompasses all missions for which the unit is organized or
designed (primary mission). MAJCOMs may elect to have a unit report on parts of the overall mission set.
If the parts of a unit’s total wartime mission are significantly distinct, the parent MAJCOM may elect to
produce multiple SORTS DOC Statements for that unit. Any major part of the overall mission (mobility,
generation, nuclear, conventional, etc.) will be a secondary mission and be described on a Secondary Mis-
sion SORTS DOC Statement. Any subordinate portion (UTC, section, flight, etc.) will be a tertiary mis-
sion and be described on a Tertiary Mission SORTS DOC Statement. Units should not use the SORTS
mission rank ordering to prioritize training or resource allocation requirements. Do this only when
directed by the MAJCOM through the planning process.
A2.3. (ACC) Single and Multiple SORTS DOC Statements (AF Form 723 or Approved Facsimile).
Normally, units will have a single DOC Statement called the primary DOC. If parts of a unit's total war-
time mission are significantly different, the parent MAJCOM may elect to produce multiple DOC State-
260                                                          AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


ments for that unit. In those cases, the most resource intensive portion of the total mission will normally
be called the primary DOC. However, MAJCOMs may elect to substitute a mission of highest priority.
The next resource intensive mission will be the secondary DOC and the third one, the tertiary DOC. Units
should not use SORTS rank ordering to prioritize training or resource allocation requirements, unless
directed by MAJCOM through the planning process.
      A2.3.1. Procedures for Secondary or Tertiary Mission SORTS DOC Statement development and
      approval are the same as the unit’s Primary Wartime Mission SORTS DOC Statement.
      A2.3.1. (ACC) For units that have secondary or tertiary DOC Statements, the primary statement
      (DOC1) will include all missions. The secondary statement(s) will be written for each different mis-
      sion set. See AFI 10-201 to further define secondary and tertiary DOCs. These additional DOCs must
      include specific guidance on how to measure resources.
      A2.3.2. Some resource area P, S, R or T-levels may be the same for secondary or tertiary missions as
      for primary mission resource area Levels. SORTS DOC Statements must include enough information
      on how to measure resources that it is clearly understood.
      A2.3.3. Some units have several missions (survive to operate, Operation Security (OPSEC)/Commu-
      nication Security (COMSEC), SABC, etc.) contained within the primary mission. The capability
      exists to measure these as elements of the primary mission. These ancillary missions of the primary
      mission are not secondary or tertiary wartime missions. SORTS DOC Statements are not normally
      required for these ancillary missions.

A2.4. Source References for SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723 or approved facsimile). T h e f o l -
lowing are examples of references, information, data, and source documents for SORTS DOC State-
ments:
      A2.4.1. SORTS Files are record files for units and contain the following information:
         A2.4.1.1. The Unit BIDE. Several fields in the SORTS BIDE set contain information which must
         be used to update the unit SORTS DOC Statement. If the unit data in the SORTS BIDE is incor-
         rect, MAJCOM SORTS offices are responsible for immediate correction.
         A2.4.1.1. (ACC) The CRO will update all BIDE for units that have DOC statements. The BIDE
         adds the unit into the GSORTS database. The FAM must ensure the CRO is aware of units that are
         being activated and have a new DOC statement.
         A2.4.1.2. The Unit’s UIC is the six-character code that identifies the unit. It is created by adding
         the letter F to the front and the number zero to the end of the last four characters of a unit’s PAS
         code. Subordinate organizations to the PAS code holding unit may be registered in SORTS using
         the “parent” unit’s PAS. Adding F to the front and a unique letter or number at the end (A, B, 1, 2,
         etc.). Provisional units may be registered by replacing the second F with an H and the character
         following that reflects it relationship to the parent.
         A2.4.1.3. The UTC in Section I of the SORTS DOC Statement is the five-character code from the
         unit’s registration BIDE. This UTC is the unit’s Deployment Indicator (DEPID) Code 9
         non-deployable UTC.
         A2.4.1.3. (ACC) The Unit Type Code (UTC) is a five character designation code that represents
         the type of unit the DOC statement is for. Use in-place UTC for the type of unit being registered.
         Each type of Air Force unit must have an in-place UTC loaded in the Joint Type Unit Characteris-
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                261


     tic (TUCHA) file. The FAMs are responsible for listing the correct deployment indicator (DEPID)
     code 9 UTC. See AFMAN 10-401V1, Chapter 6, for details.
     A2.4.1.4. The Unit ANAME is the standardized unit abbreviation from AFPD 38-5, Unit Desig-
     nations, if available and a unit designation (number).
  A2.4.2. Air Staff and MAJCOM FAM Tasking Documents may be used to obtain specific informa-
  tion on tasks and UTC configurations.
  A2.4.3. USAF WMP-3 is divided into three parts and contains information on Combat Forces and the
  AFWUS. WMP-3, Part 1 identifies AF General Purpose Combat Deployable Forces, Part 2 identifies
  Combat Support Deployable Forces (LRS, medical, chaplain, comm., etc.), and Part 3 is a list of
  USAF UTCs approved for use in planning and is the catalog of capabilities the AF offers to the sup-
  ported CCs to build OPLAN taskings. The AFWUS is the system of record to record the UTC task-
  ings of wings/units and to provide AF planners with a list of USAF UTCs available for tasking.
  MAJCOMs must disseminate this UTC availability information to their wings/units to ensure the
  units know what UTCs they are tasked to support. The AFWUS lists which units will provide UTCs,
  DOC Statements define what UTCs units are designated to support, and the MISCAP defines what
  specific capability the UTCs can provide.
  A2.4.4. USAF WMP-5 describes basic planning factors and data used for aircraft sortie and flying
  hour data.
  A2.4.5. A current manpower detail listing (MP-4 report) from a standard MANFOR retrieval may be
  used to determine current manpower and critical AFSC configurations for tasked UTCs.
  A2.4.6. A current Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD) extract can be used to list
  tasks in various plans.
  A2.4.7. Refer to Table A2.2. for AFI references for SORTS DOC Statements.
  A2.4.8. USAF WMP I, Annex F, lists medical unit response times.

A2.5. SORTS DOC Statement Preparation.
      A2.5.1. HQ USAF SORTS Office will:
         A2.5.1.1. Forward copies of initial SORTS DOC Statements to air staff-level functional offices of
         primary responsibility, as required, for review and coordination.
         A2.5.1.2. Keep a master file of all initial and reviewed SORTS DOC Statements.
         A2.5.1.3. HQ USAF/XOO reserves the right to challenge any SORTS DOC Statement.
      A2.5.2. MAJCOMs, ANG, and FOA/DRU will:
         A2.5.2.1. Develop, coordinate, and approve unit SORTS DOC Statements. All MAJCOMs,
         ANG, and FOA/DRU will develop, coordinate, and approve unit SORTS DOC Statements using
         prepared system software, Microsoft Word Template, JetFlow, or MS Access. If an AF Form 723
         is not used, coordinate with HQ USAF SORTS and ensure alternate methods provide all informa-
         tion on the AFF 723, Sections I through VI.
             A2.5.2.1.1. AFRC and NGB must coordinate proposed SORTS DOC Statements with the ini-
             tial gaining command (e.g., ACC, AMC, PACAF, etc.).
             A2.5.2.1.2. AFRC and ANG will suspense gaining MAJCOM DOs/XOs with a date 45 days
             after gaining MAJCOM receipt of the draft SORTS DOC Statement. If no response is received
             by the suspense date, then AFRC or ANG will assume MAJCOM concurrence on the SORTS
             DOC Statement as written.
         A2.5.2.2. Provide HQ USAF SORTS with copies of all DOC Statements. MAJCOMs, who pro-
         vide DOCs via web pages, must send an electronic mail (e-mail) to HQ USAF SORTS informing
         of new or updated DOCs. MAJCOMs that do not provide access to DOC Statements via web page
         must send an e-mail with the current DOC Statements attached. DOCs briefed in the Air Staff
         JQRR will be e-mailed regardless of availability.
         A2.5.2.3. The CRO will send the approved DOC Statement to the SRO.
         A2.5.2.4. Submit requests for new DOCIDs, not listed in Table A2.3. , to HQ SORTS at least 30
         calendar days prior to the programmed effective date. This will provide adequate time to update
         computer programs.
         A2.5.2.5. Maintain a copy of all unit SORTS DOC Statements under their command.
      A2.5.3. Measured units and subordinate reporting organizations will:
         A2.5.3.1. Maintain a copy of each unit’s SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723).
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                      263


       A2.5.3.2. Make sure the unit commander reviews the SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723) as
       required per paragraph 1.11.11.1.8.

A2.6. SORTS DOC Statement Annual Review. MAJCOM FAMs will review their respective SORTS
DOC Statements on an annual basis and prior to the statement anniversary date. If there are any changes,
FAMs must submit a new SORTS DOC Statement (AFF 723) to the local SORTS office for processing
IAW paragraph A2.5. Each MAJCOM, ANG, FOA and DRU will ensure HQ SORTS, all interested MAJ-
COMs, and reporting units receive a SORTS DOC Statement annual review document that lists the unit
UIC, ANAME, location, and DOCID. Discrepancies should be addressed to the SORTS office that initi-
ated the review. All SORTS DOC Statements, other than initial statements, must have a current review
date (less than one year old). Each MAJCOM, ANG, FOA and DRU SORTS office will be responsible for
tracking annual reviews and notifying FAMs when an annual review is due.
A2.6. (ACC) SORTS DOC Statement Annual Review. ACC functional managers will contact HQ
ACC/A3XR to initiate a DOC review package. HQ ACC/A3XR will originate this package and assist the
functional manager in preparation of the DOC statement(s). The FAM will ensure all documentation
throughout the review/coordination process is completed. Final coordination will always be with HQ
ACC/A3XR. HQ ACC/A3XR will return the package to the functional manager to obtain the applicable
level of (two letter) approval once all required actions are complete.
   A2.6.1. (Added-ACC) A review is considered accomplished when full bottom-line and top line coor-
   dination has been completed as a result of tasking or measurement changes. If there are no changes, as
   a minimum, the functional manager will coordinate the DOC statement to update effective date. Oth-
   erwise the DOC statement is considered outdated. Outdated DOC Statements must be replaced as
   soon as possible.
   A2.6.2. (Added-ACC) DOC statements for a given functional area should be reviewed and coordi-
   nated at the same time. However, if an individual unit resource authorization and/or tasking changed,
   it would require a new DOC statement.
   A2.6.3. (Added-ACC) The FAM will ensure the OPR information on the DOC statement reflects
   correct office symbol and phone number.

A2.7. SORTS DOC Statement Unit Tasking Changes. As a norm, SORTS DOC Statements must be
revised at least 30 days prior to any significant expected change(s) in unit tasking to include, but not be
limited to, changes in types of major equipment, unit mission, or unit response time. Unexpected changes
that may require DOC revision must be made no later than 60 days after changes are known.
A2.7. (ACC) SORTS DOC Statement Unit Tasking Changes. HQ ACC FAMs will notify HQ ACC/
A3XR of required changes or additions to DOC statements as early as possible.
   A2.7.1. MAJCOMs, ANG, FOA, and DRU develop and coordinate changes to unit SORTS DOC
   Statements. All MAJCOMs, ANG, and FOA/DRU will complete an AF Form 723. If the AF Form
   723 is not used, coordinate with HQ USAF SORTS and provide all information from the AFF 723,
   Sections I through IV. AFRC and NGB must coordinate proposed changes to SORTS DOC State-
   ments with initial gaining command (e.g., ACC, AMC, PACAF, etc.) IAW A2.5.2.1.2.
   A2.7.2. Submit one copy of each unit’s changed SORTS DOC Statement to HQ USAF SORTS as an
   attachment to e-mail or DMS message. Coordinate with HQ USAF SORTS for points of contact and
264                                                         AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


      addresses (if e-mail is not possible, coordinate for an alternate means to submit a unit’s changed
      SORTS DOC Statement(s).
      A2.7.3. Accomplish actions listed from paragraph A2.5.2.3. through A2.5.3.2.

A2.8. SORTS DOC Statement (AF Form 723) Instructions. Reference Figure A2.1. through Figure
A2.8. for samples of SORTS DOC Statements. SORTS DOC Statements will normally be classified
according to derivative classification guidance.
      A2.8.1. Part I, Unit Identification.
         A2.8.1.1. Measured Unit. Use the abbreviated name from SORTS BIDE set, ANAME field, that
         is paired to the UIC entry.
         A2.8.1.2. Home Location. Use the home geographic name and country or state code from the
         GEONA (geographic name) and CRTCD (country code) fields in the GEOFILE (geographic loca-
         tion file).
         A2.8.1.3. To establish a UTC use one of the following methods: 1) Use the DEPID Code 9 UTC
         from the UTC label in SORTS. This is a non-deployable, in-place UTC, assigned by HQ USAF
         and used by the JCS for categorization of the unit type or 2) use a UTC from the tasked set that is
         most representative of the unit mission.
         A2.8.1.3. (ACC) Use the code from the MEFPAK under the label UTC.
         A2.8.1.4. UIC. Use the code from SORTS BIDE set, UIC field.
         A2.8.1.4. (ACC) Use the code from the PAS under the label UIC.
         A2.8.1.5. DOC Mission Title. Select a long mission title from Table A2.3. that best describes the
         unit mission. If no available long mission title adequately describes the unit, recommend a new
         one to HQ USAF SORTS.
         A2.8.1.6. GEOLOC. Use the code from SORTS in the label HOGEO.
         A2.8.1.7. DOCID. Paired with the mission title entry, select the DOCID from Table A2.3. that
         was chosen for the DOC mission title.
             A2.8.1.7.1. For new titles, use the area letter and XX99 (e.g., SX99) as an interim DOCID.
             Request a new DOCID from HQ USAF SORTS using the format in Figure A2.9. Interim
             DOCIDs are valid for 90 days.
             A2.8.1.7.2. Submit request for changes to DOCIDs not listed in Table A2.3. . to HQ USAF
             SORTS at least 30 calendar days prior to the programmed effective date to provide adequate
             time to update computer programs. Tables in this instruction will follow with the next update
             cycle.
         A2.8.1.8. DOCNR. Only the primary mission SORTS DOC Statement will use DOCNR 1. Major
         portions of the unit’s mission, listed in secondary mission SORTS DOC Statements, will use
         DOCNR 2 through 9. Subordinate portions of the unit’s mission, listed in tertiary mission SORTS
         DOC Statements will use DOCNR A through J.
         A2.8.1.9. Mission Rank. Select primary, secondary or tertiary via paragraph A2.3.

     A2.8.2.1. A. Mission Tasking Narrative. Describe the unit’s wartime mission in plain text using
     missions in AF Doctrine Document (AFDD) 1-1, Air Force Task List. This is a summary of the
     mission capabilities the unit brings to the tasks for which it is designed. List major tasks and their
     purposes (e.g., provide rapid intra-theater mobility for all military forces) for each mission (JCS/
     AF) and any special mission capabilities the unit is organized or designed to provide. Special mis-
     sion capabilities are included when they are essential for mission success.
     A2.8.2.1. (ACC) Verify validity of mission statement narratives (Section IIA of DOC statement).
     Narratives will be limited to wartime missions the unit was designed to perform. Missions, which
     require less than the full unit resources, will list the required number. If these requirements change
     more than twice a year, the functional manager may reference the source document, which pre-
     scribes the required number. A copy of the latter will be provided to HQ ACC/A3XR.
        A2.8.2.1.1. The most resource demanding OPLAN or set of UTC(s) mission capabilities
        should be referenced if it is used as the basis for unit reporting.
        A2.8.2.1.2. Address secondary missions, tertiary missions, additional, or special capabilities
        separately in the SORTS DOC Statement Section IV.
     A2.8.2.2. B. Mission Specifics.
        A2.8.2.2.1. Response Time. Enter the response time that upon which the C-level is based
        (from OPLAN, WMP-3, UTC, etc.). Enter the shortest time in hours (01 - 72 hours) by which
        all unit resources are to be generated or prepared for deployment. Aircraft units response time
        source is the WMP-3, Part 1 availability date.
            A2.8.2.2.1.1. For units with alert, generation, Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03, or sur-
            veillance missions, use the time required to employ all tasked forces. For aircraft units, the
            response time source is WMP-3, Part 1 availability date.
            A2.8.2.2.1.2. Units with a mobility mission will use the time to begin loading of common
            user or organic lift before deployment (i.e., ready-to-load date at origin).
            A2.8.2.2.1.3. Active duty and specifically identified Reserve and Guard SF units must be
            able to deploy within 24 hours after notification per WMP 1, Annex T.
            A2.8.2.2.1.4. Reserve and Guard units not specifically identified must be able to deploy
            within 72 hours of notification.
            A2.8.2.2.1.5. Ensure response time for Reserve and Guard units includes 24 hours for
            mobilization or call-up plus time allocated for preparation once mobilized. SF units will
            comply with Attachment 2, paragraphs A2.8.2.2.1.3. and A2.8.2.2.1.4.
            A2.8.2.2.1.6. When response times exceed 72 hours or a source reference does not exist,
            use the default time of 72 hours IAW JCS policy. Do not use this default time for other
            than SORTS reporting.
            A2.8.2.2.1.6. (ACC) The GSORTS SORTS database processor will not allow numbers
            above 72 hours when reporting SORTS into the database, so a default of 72 hours was
            established for response times above 72 hours. This is for reporting purposes only and is
            not a default time for the DOC statement, nor is AFI 10-201 a default reference for DOC
            response times. Units with multiple missions and/or response times must list additional
266                                                       AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


             response times in Section IV, Amplifying Notes. The response time is classified IAW the
             source document it was derived from.
         A2.8.2.2.2. Source. List the source for the response time. When the source reference does not
         exist, exceeds the default time, or if the default time was used, list “AFI 10-201”. Indicate the
         paragraph number of the source used within the provided brackets, e.g., [3.2.1.]. When "AFI
         10-201" is listed as the source, reference the source document and paragraph number for the
         response time in part IV - Amplifying Notes.
         A2.8.2.2.3. MDS. Use the WMP-3, Part 1 or USAF Program Document to enter the number
         and type of major equipment and PMAI. Do not include BAI. List the MDS for missiles (e.g.,
         ICBMs).
         A2.8.2.2.4. Sorties/Flying Hours (aircraft units only). Use sortie factors in WMP-5 to enter
         sortie rates and sortie duration, and rates the unit is required to perform for its wartime mis-
         sion(s).
      A2.8.2.3. UTCs Required to Support. Enter the UTCs for force packages that the unit is expected
      to be able to simultaneously support. These UTCs are the AFWUS UTCs with a Nonsourced Unit
      Type Code (NSUTC) of “DWS”, “DWX” (the total number of standard UTCs coded as “DW_”
      (DWS and DWX) represent the maximum number of standard UTCs the unit can deploy simulta-
      neously during wartime surge and any UTCs associated with the unit's in-place wartime mis-
      sion(s). All of these UTCs must be included in Part II of the DOC Statement and reported in the
      unit's SORTS C-Level.
         A2.8.2.3.1. For alert, generation, Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03, and surveillance mis-
         sions, use the unit’s in-place UTC (coded as “non-deployable” in AFWUS), or other deploy-
         able UTCs required for home station support during wartime.
         A2.8.2.3.1. (ACC) For EWO, alert, generation, surveillance, and OPLAN 8044 missions, use
         in-place Unit Manning Document (UMD) and Allowance Standard (AS) to measure unit's
         wartime capabilities.
         A2.8.2.3.2. For mobility missions, list standard, deployable UTCs (AFWUS NSUTC codes of
         “DWS” and “DWX” as a minimum). Since UTC detail is used for measuring/reporting
         SORTS, ensure UTC detail is complete.
         A2.8.2.3.3. Use a combination of both deployable and in-place generation UTCs for com-
         bined in-place generation and mobility missions. Functional managers are responsible for
         de-conflicting the UTCs and providing guidance on which UTCs a unit can be expected to
         simultaneously support. Use remarks sections to illuminate how each tasking should be con-
         sidered in light of others that may conflict (i.e., assumptions in planning may exclude one or
         the other tasking like Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03 and conventional mobility).
             A2.8.2.3.3.1. Units may be resourced to be able to provide combinations of UTCs that
             would in aggregate exceed their total assets, (i.e. parent-child UTCs) but they must not be
             postured/tasked in the AFWUS or plans beyond their authorized resource levels. UTC
             combinations that cannot be de-conflicted (i.e. Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03/mobil-
             ity) should be delineated on the AF Form 723, Section IV, Amplifying Notes. The assump-
             tions on which a dual tasking lies must be provided or referenced.
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                      267


            A2.8.2.3.3.2. If a unit shares a UTC tasking with another unit (split tasking), or is not
            required to support the entire UTC, place a hyphen (-) after the applicable UTC, and note
            the details in Part IIIA, Additional Notes. All units supporting the tasking will list the UTC
            in their SORTS DOC Statement. Each SORTS DOC Statement will list all of the units sup-
            porting the split UTC tasking.
            A2.8.2.3.3.2. (ACC) Split UTC tasking details should reflect, in detail, what a unit is or is
            not responsible for supporting/measuring. This is to ensure the unit providing augmenta-
            tion counts these resources as available for its split tasking and to ensure the unit receiving
            augmentation (or not required to support that part of the UTC) does not count these details
            as "requirements."
            A2.8.2.3.3.3. Commander assessments will be based on providing either/or combinations
            of resources, not all simultaneously in these cases. When the unit commander must assess
            specific resource combinations, they should be listed. All instances of Parent-Child UTCs
            must first be approved by the USAF War and Mobilization Plans Division (AF/XOXW).
     A2.8.2.4. Direct Support Units UICs. Enter direct support unit UICs and ANAMEs.
     A2.8.2.4. (ACC) Enter UICs of all units providing resources for the unit being measured in the
     DOC statement. A Memorandum of Agreement between the Direct Supporting Unit (DSU) and
     measured unit must be accomplished to show accountability of these resources (An example
     MOA can be found on https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Fil-
     ter=OO-OP-AC-35).
         A2.8.2.4.1. (Added-ACC) Provide unit name for all UICs for units providing resources to the
         measured unit used in DOC statement(s) in Section IID. These UICs are considered Direct
         Supporting Units and their assets will be counted in unit's total numbers the DSU is support-
         ing. The DSUs are units with no DOC statement of their own, and cannot be simultaneously or
         double-tasked by more than one unit for the same operational plan.
         A2.8.2.4.2. (Added-ACC) DSUs will provide measured units the readiness/availability of
         DSU resources required by the measured unit.. If the DSU manages three or less billets for the
         Measured Unit, the specific AFSCs and quantities of each will be listed.
     A2.8.2.5. OPLANs (Optional). List those OPLANs and other documents that the unit is tasked to
     support. Identify plans by command and number (e.g., United States Commander European Com-
     mand (USCOMEUR) OPLAN 4102). This will classify the SORTS DOC Statement IAW the
     OPLAN classification guidance. If no specific OPLAN is identified, enter Command Directed.
     A2.8.2.5. (ACC) List all OPLANS (including EWO) and other documents that the unit is tasked
     to support (Section IIE). This section (IIE) should coincide with section V (Gaining Commands).
     For ANG, only list flying units. The most resource demanding operational plan should be refer-
     enced if it is used as the basis for unit reporting.
  A2.8.3. Part III, Measured Resource Area
     A2.8.3.1. Personnel Measured Area. Check the applicable box(s).
     A2.8.3.1. (ACC) Functional managers will determine if the Total Personnel measured resource
     area is measured using either the UMD or UTCs IAW AFI 10-201. Alert, generation, combined
     generation and mobility, or surveillance unit DOC statements will direct the unit to use the autho-
268                                                       AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


      rizations described in the wartime UMD. Mobility only unit DOC statements will direct the unit to
      use the requirements in the manpower detail of UTCs. FAMs will compare each functional UTC
      with unit UMD authorizations to determine availability of each UTC requirement IAW AFM
      10-401, Chapter 9. Intelligence units with a combined generation and mobility mission will list the
      UMD as the source document unless specifically directed to list minimum essential manning list
      (MEML).
         A2.8.3.1.1. Total. Place an X in this box to indicate total personnel is to be reported, regard-
         less of UMD or UTC, along with critical personnel listed in Table 3.1. and emergency essen-
         tial and Key DOD civilians.
         A2.8.3.1.2. UMD and UTC. FAMs with alert, generation, combined in-place generation and
         mobility, or surveillance units will place an X in the UMD box to tell the unit to use the war-
         time requirements described in the UMD. Missions with mobility only taskings will have an X
         placed in the UTC box to tell the unit to use manpower details of UTCs listed in Section IIC of
         the SORTS DOC Statement. Units with a combined generation and mobility mission will list
         the UMD as the source document. Intelligence units may use MEMLs when matched by the
         UMD. The “civilians” block will be marked with an X when US emergency essential or Key
         DOD civilians are part of the unit’s wartime requirement. Add additional notes as required.
         A2.8.3.1.3. Critical. Place an X in this box if the unit has critical AFSCs or packets listed in
         Chapter 3, Table 3.1. Critical personnel are those identified as essential to the launch, recov-
         ery, or turn around of a unit’s weapon system, or the direct accomplishment of the unit’s spec-
         ified wartime mission. They are critical because their absence would materially effect the
         mission.
         A2.8.3.1.4. Civilians. Place an X in this box when the unit has emergency essential or Key
         DoD civilian requirements on UTC manpower details or coded emergency essential positions
         on the UMD. This directs units to include DoD emergency essential and Key civilian person-
         nel requirements in C-level reporting but not personnel hired by host nation or contractors.
         Host nation or contractor personnel resources should be considered in commander assessment
         when relevant.
         A2.8.3.1.5. Additional Notes. Use this area to amplify other personnel measured area entries.
         A2.8.3.1.6. Split UTC tasking details (i.e. UIC, AFSCs, number of requirements, etc.).
         Include adequate details for the unit known to have resources it provides for the split UTC
         tasking and which it measures in SORTS. Also include the names and locations of the other
         unit(s) supporting the split UTC taskings.
      A2.8.3.2. Equipment and Supplies O/H Measured Area. This area of the SORTS DOC Statement
      lists general types of combat essential (major) equipment and general categories of support equip-
      ment and supplies to be measured. For each subarea in a category, list equipment followed by the
      subarea label (e.g., vehicles (ESSA4). If no subareas are used, use the EQSEE label for combat
      essential equipment and EQSSE for support equipment. Source document names can replace long
      lists. Add additional notes as needed.
         A2.8.3.2.1. Combat Essential Equipment. Enter all equipment subareas from Table 4.1., Col-
         umn B and subarea equipment types from Table 4.4. for which the unit has equipment autho-
         rizations. Aerial port, LRS, and mission support units will also use Table 4.8., Table 4.10., and
         Table 4.11..
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                  269


        A2.8.3.2.2. Support Equipment and Supplies. Enter all equipment subareas in Table 4.1., Col-
        umn C and subarea equipment types in Table 4.4. for which the unit has equipment and sup-
        plies authorizations. Aerial port units will also use Table 4.10.
            A2.8.3.2.2.1. Spare engines and MRSP/IRSP for Strategic airlift units will be reported by
            MAJCOM in their fleet report and will not be reported at the unit level. Units report noth-
            ing in fields ESSA1 and ESSA2.
            A2.8.3.2.2.2. Units will ensure engine requirements in their DOC reflect the most recent
            WRE requirements.
        A2.8.3.2.3. Additional Notes. Use this area to explain equipment and supplies O/H area
        entries to include:
            A2.8.3.2.3.1. Spares assessment driver for aircraft units. Indicate ASM, WSMIS-SAM, or
            RSP fill rates. Continue to use ASM unless your MAJCOM has authorized use of the
            WSMIS-SAM as an interim measure for reporting the spares subarea percentage. ASM is
            the primary means of determining the spares subarea percentage followed by the
            WSMIS-SAM (if approved by MAJCOM and HQ USAF/XOOA), then RSP fill rate when
            directed by parent MAJCOM.
            A2.8.3.2.3.1. (ACC) Fill rates are normally used once per year and only during MAJ-
            COM RSP reconciliation.
            A2.8.3.2.3.2. All units with aircraft using ASM derived percentages for spare assessment
            will report IAW Table 4.9. Use the ASM as a commander’s tool to assess the unit’s overall
            C-level (if appropriate) and then report the ASM sortie percentage, ASM problem parts,
            and parts status in the ESSA1 remark.
        A2.8.3.2.4. (Added-ACC) IAW AFI 10-201, all aviation DOC statements will appropriately
        include the following guidance under combat essential, "All units with airborne MRSPs use
        PC-ASM derived percentages for spare assessment (aircraft availability driver code "Z" under
        ARUSD) unless PC-ASM is not available or inaccurate, then use MRSP fill rates (driver code
        "X"). List top five problem parts, supply status, and get well date in the ESSA1 remark."
     A2.8.3.3. Equipment Condition Measured Area. This area of the SORTS DOC Statement lists
     general types of combat essential (major) equipment and general categories of support equipment
     to be measured. Add additional notes as needed.
     A2.8.3.3. (ACC) The Equipment Condition section lists the condition of combat and/or support
     equipment that could be tasked. Identify measured equipment and provide the reference prescrib-
     ing the criteria (Section IIIC of DOC statement). FAMs may elect to use a packet methodology for
     measuring equipment condition. Use of packet methodology allows shortfalls to be more visible
     within SORTS. It also provides space for additional remarks.
        A2.8.3.3.1. Combat Essential Equipment. Enter all equipment subareas from Table 5.1., Col-
        umn B and subarea equipment types from Table 5.4. for which the unit has equipment and
        supplies authorizations. Aerial port, LRS, and mission support units will also use Table 5.14.
        through Table 5.16..
270                                                            AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


             A2.8.3.3.2. Support Equipment. Enter all equipment subareas from Table 5.1., Column C and
             subarea equipment types from Table 5.4. for which the unit has equipment and supplies autho-
             rizations. Aerial port units will also use Table 5.17.
             A2.8.3.3.3. Additional Notes. Use this area to explain equipment condition area entries to
             include long-term non-reportable items (e.g., excluded subsystems), sources for numbers
             required, and directions for special mission capabilities equipment if part of the unit’s full war-
             time requirement.
         A2.8.3.4. Training Measured Resource Area.
             A2.8.3.4.1. Training Method Used. The Air Force uses two training methods. Place an X in
             the appropriate Training Method block. (Training Method B and Training Method C, Option 1
             or 2).
             A2.8.3.4.1. (ACC) Name the training method each unit should use to measure training. There
             are two training methods, B and C. Training Method B, Crew Training, is used for non-Com-
             bat Air Force flying units. Training Method C is comprised of two options, Option 1 and 2.
             Option 1, Unit Training, is used for support units. All Active, Reserve, and National Guard
             units with a CAF mission will use Option 2, which is designed to support the Ready Aircrew
             Program. The appropriate table in AFI 10-201 lists the types of training for each sub-area, fol-
             lowed by the sub-area label (e.g., chemical warfare defense training (TRSA 2)). If there are no
             sub-areas, use "TRUTC".
             A2.8.3.4.2. List the source document(s) for the training standard. If standards are not listed in
             a single document, list the most significant source in the area provided, and the other source
             documents in the additional notes area.
             A2.8.3.4.3. Additional Notes. Include additional training directives used, directions for spe-
             cial mission capability, equipment, and the types of training for each subarea from Table 6.4.
             followed by the subarea label. If there are no subareas, use TRUTC. Source document names
             can replace long lists.
             A2.8.3.4.3. (ACC) Provide the reference that prescribes unit training requirements (Section
             IIID of DOC statement).
      A2.8.4. Part IV, Amplifying Notes. Use this part of the SORTS DOC Statement to include the fol-
      lowing:
         A2.8.4.1. For flying units, list capabilities being measured. Also, list special capabilities being
         reported but not measured. FAMs will select these special capabilities only from Table 2.3.
         A2.8.4.2. Any requirement for special capabilities reported in the TRSA2 field and the AFSPE-
         CAP set.
         A2.8.4.3. Overflow from additional note entries or descriptions of assumptions used for units
         with overlapping taskings between two or more OPLANS.
         A2.8.4.4. Any requirement for subordinate mission reporting in SUBOVRAL transactions.

         (AF Form 723) (paragraph A2.8.2.3.3.2.). The hyphen indicator in Part IIC indicates the unit
         shares a tasking with another unit or is not required to support the entire UTC.
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                      271


       A2.8.4.5. (ACC) Coordinate with the Direct Support Unit (DSU) FAM to ensure their portion of
       the split tasking is noted on their DOC statement if applicable. See AFI 10-201, paragraph
       A2.8.2.3.3.2., for rules on DSU relationships. DSUs will not be dual tasked to support more than
       one potentially simultaneous tasking.
       A2.8.4.6. (Added-ACC) Identify the peacetime assigned commander as listed in the Forces for
       Unified Commands document. Combat support/combat service support units are assigned to the
       commander that is apportioned the combat forces that they support as indicated in the "Forces
       For".
       A2.8.4.7. (Added-ACC) Address secondary missions, additional or special capabilities sepa-
       rately in section (IV) of the DOC Statement if not used to compute C-level.
   A2.8.5. Part V, Gaining Commands. As a minimum, list the unified command and Air Force compo-
   nents of the unified command, for which the unit has a current operations plan tasking.
   A2.8.6. Part VI, Coordination/Review. Use this section of the SORTS DOC Statement (AF Form
   723) as required to coordinate initial statements and annual review(s) of SORTS DOC Statements.
   A2.8.7. Additional space requirements may be met by attaching typewritten pages. The continuation
   should be noted in the appropriate box by placing “(see attached page)” in the lower right corner of the
   block continued from the AF Form 723.
A2.9. (Added-ACC) Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command (HQ AFRC) and the National
Guard Bureau (NGB) DOC Coordination. HQ AFRC and the NGB will coordinate proposed DOC
Statements with the initial gaining commands (i.e., ACC, Air Mobility Command (AMC), Air Force Spe-
cial Operations Command (AFSOC), Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) or Pacific Air Forces
(PACAF)). ACC FAMs will coordinate through HQ ACC/A3XR the DOC statements that pertain to their
functional area of expertise. No response to the AFRC or NGB within 45 days indicates coordination con-
currence.
   A2.9.1. (Added-ACC) Within 45 days after approval of the Master DOC statement, HQ AFRC and
   the ANG will provide a copy of the Master DOC statement to ACC. All ANG DOC Statements (clas-
   sified and unclassified) are available via the NGB/A3XW SIPR website at http://ga14.af.penta-
   gon.smil.mil/angxoxw/.
A2.10. (Added-ACC) DOC Statement Review. Recipients at all levels must review new DOC State-
ments and forward any comments to HQ ACC/A3XR.
A2.11. (Added-ACC) DOC Statement Coordination. FAMs obtain full bottom-line/top-line coordina-
tion and two letter approval during revisions and annual reviews. NOTE: Bottom-line coordination
non-concurrence will not delay continued coordination. Every effort will be made by the DOC responsi-
ble FAM to reconcile coordinating agencies non-concurrence. FAMs will electronically make all changes
in red to clearly identify areas on the DOC statement being revised.
A2.12. (Added-ACC) Coordinator Responsibilities. Upon initiating a DOC package, the FAM and HQ
ACC/A3XR will accomplish a review of the DOC prior to any coordination being accomplished. HQ
ACC/A3XR will be the final bottom-line coordination. FAMs will not coordinate Bottom-line/Top line at
the same time. DOC coordination is to be accomplished IAW the DOC Process and Coordination check-
list(s) maintained by HQ ACC/A3XR. Current and newly assigned FAMs may request and are encour-
aged to receive individual refresher and initial DOC FAM training from HQ ACC/A3XR on the DOC
Statement coordination checklists and processes.

A2.13. (Added-ACC) DOC Statement Errors and Corrective Procedures. Administrative errors (i.e.,
typographical errors, changes that do not alter the content or reporting criteria of the overall DOC) do not
require full coordination. HQ ACC/A3XR will publish and release a corrected DOC statement to fix these
errors. Errors that do change mission content or reporting criteria will be coordinated using Interim Mes-
sage Change (IMC) procedures or full DOC statement review with the applicable staff agency(ies), ACC
two letter approved and distributed to the units. HQ ACC/A3XR will determine what type coordination is
required on a case-by-case basis. DOC corrections do not alleviate the requirement for annual review.

SUBJECT: Establishing a DOC Identifier and Mission Title for BEAR Base Systems


1. There is currently no DOC Identifier (DOCID) or Mission Titles on record for any BEAR Base system tasking. In the past,
we have had to use an interim DOCID (SX99), as identified in Attachment 2, paragraph A2.8.1.7. of AFI 10-201. Request a
DOCID and Mission Titles (Short and Long) for use in all BEAR Base system SORTS DOC Statement (AF Form 723) to be
included in AFI 10-201 for SORTS reporting.
2. The Unit Type Code for BEAR Base systems SORTS DOC Statement (AF Form 723) are as follows:
         XFFWT             XFBYD            XFBR3             XFFLT            XFBR3
         XFFLT             XFBS1            XFBJ1             XFBS2            XFBJ2
         XFBKA             XFBR4            XFBL4             XFFLU            XFBKB
         XFBYC             XFBCW            XFFLW             XFBRB            JFABS
3. Request adding BEAR Base Systems to Attachment 2, Table A2.3. , DOC Identification Code and Mission Titles, Section
U - Base Support:
         DOCID                     Short Mission Title                Long Mission Title
         UD30                      BEAR Base Systems Set/Packs        Harvest Falcon and Harvest Eagle Sets/Packages
4. BEAR Base Systems are a growing and vital part of the Air Force’s war fighting capability. They are an important part of
the wartime mission and a key part of the rapidly mobile Air Expeditionary Force. Establishment of both a DOCID and Mis-
sion Titles will help clarify BEAR Base as a viable system and ensure our SORTS DOC Statement (AF Form 723) support
their purpose to provide specific measurement standards for unit C-level reporting.

                    BASIC IDENTITY DATA ELEMENT (BIDE) REPORTING

A3.1. Basic Identity Data Element Purpose. Data entered through the BIDE set into the SORTS data-
base provides users with authoritative unit identity information. The BIDE set data enables SORTS to fill
its role as the central registry for all military units of the DoD. All AF units with a PAS will be registered
in SORTS.
   A3.1.1. Units with classified PAS codes (up to an including SECRET) will be registered. If the unit
   has a PAS code, the UIC will end with a zero “0”. In special cases, if the unit does not have a PAS
   code, the unit is formed from the parent unit. Use the parent UIC and substitute the 0 with a letter (A
   through Z). Units cannot reuse a previously registered unique UIC. If a subordinate unit merges with
   the parent UIC, then subsequently separates from the parent UIC again, the previous UIC should not
   be used for at least two years.
   A3.1.2. Provisional units will be registered. The Provisional Unit will register with its UIC first two
   digits of FH (FHXXXX). Provisional units formed from active units (FFXXXX) will use the third
   through fifth character of the parent UIC, an H in the second, and a sixth character that best indicates
   the provisional unit’s relationship to the parent. Examples: 41 FW (FFABC0) to 41 FW Provisional
   [just the headquarters element] (FHABCA) or 66 AS (FFSSS0) to 66 AS Provisional [whole unit
   deployed] (FHSSS0). Provisional units with a unique PAS code will be registered using the last four
   of that PAS for the second through fifth characters of the UIC. When the unit is registered, the
   ORGLOCN sets must be entered in addition to BIDE set.

A3.2. BIDE Set Usage. The BIDE set is used in the following four specific instances for SORTS mes-
sage processing:
   A3.2.1. Used by the RPTOR to initially register an organization in SORTS.
   A3.2.2. Used to change previously reported data.
   A3.2.3. Used to delete data on a unit that inactivates/deactivates or was registered in error.
   A3.2.4. Used to validate unit registration.

A3.3. HQ USAF Responsibilities.
   A3.3.1. In concert with the JS and other Services, perform a semi-annual UIC validation.
   A3.3.2. Notify RPTOR of any known database discrepancies for immediate corrective action.
   A3.3.3. Maintain an updated version of the AFSORTSDET-BIDE Entry Tool.

A3.4. Command Reporting Organizations (RPTOR) Responsibilities.
All CROs prepare and submit BIDE reports (including RPTNORG and ORGLOCN sets) on all Active,
AF Reserve, and Air National Guard units, including DETs assigned a PAS code.
   A3.4.1. RPTORs will register their units when they are listed in the PAS directory or G-Series orders,
   unless permission is granted by HQ USAF/XOOA to register them before they are listed. RPTORs
   must ensure unit registration data is kept current and available in the joint database. This includes add-
302                                                          AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


      ing or deleting missing or outdated information. Periodic comparisons will be undertaken to align
      PAS and BIDE records.
      A3.4.2. Individual measured units and SROs will not be responsible for BIDE reporting.
      A3.4.3. BIDE Data Validation to JCS. Use of the AFSORTSDET-BIDE Entry Tool will suffice as
      HQ USAF initial validation of BIDE data to the JS.

A3.5. Unit Registration.
      A3.5.1. Establishing Unit Identity. Identity is established in SORTS using the BIDE set. To initially
      register a unit, report all mandatory fields in the BIDE, RPTNORG, and ORGLOCN sets (according
      to Table A3.1., Table A3.2., and Table A3.3.) using the ADD transaction code.
      A3.5.2. Changing Unit Registration Data. Using the CHANGE transaction code, report all mandatory
      and conditional fields that have changed since the unit’s initial registration.
         A3.5.2.1. After an initial BIDE report has been submitted use the TRANSFER set to change the
         RPTOR.
         A3.5.2.2. To delete existing data on a unit or when a unit has been registered in error, submit the
         BIDE report using the DELETE transaction code.

A3.6. AFSORTSDET-BIDE Entry Tool.
      A3.6.1. Reports and Checklists. The AFSORTSDET-BIDE Entry Tool contains three reports and
      their associated checklists: BIDE, RPTNORG, and ORGLOCN. Associated checklists allow plain
      language to be entered and then automatically converted into the appropriate codes/formats to be
      transmitted to the GSORTS processor.
         A3.6.1.1. The BIDE checklist contains all the necessary data to build a complete BIDE set for a
         specific UIC. With some fields requiring entered data or selecting the correct data from a list, and
         some data being derived.
             A3.6.1.1.1. The Basic Identity Status screen displays the current UIC in the upper left portion
             of the checklist.
             A3.6.1.1.2. Enter the appropriate data into the Basic Identity Status checklist and select the
             ACCEPT button.
         A3.6.1.2. The RPTNORG checklist contains all the necessary elements to build a complete RPT-
         NORG set for a specific UIC. With some fields requiring entered data or selecting the correct data
         from a list.
             A3.6.1.2.1. The currently selected UIC is displayed in the upper left portion of the RPT-
             NORG checklist.
             A3.6.1.2.2. The unit name is displayed in the upper middle portion of the checklist.
             A3.6.1.2.3. Enter all appropriate data into the checklist and select the ACCEPT button.
         A3.6.1.3. The ORGLOCN checklist contains all the necessary elements to build a complete
         ORGLOCN set for a specific UIC. With some fields requiring entered data or selecting the correct
         data from a list.
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                   303


          A3.6.1.3.1. The currently selected UIC is displayed in the upper left portion of the
          ORGLOCN checklist.
          A3.6.1.3.2. The unit name is displayed in the upper middle portion of the checklist.
          A3.6.1.3.3. Enter all appropriate data into the checklist and select the ACCEPT button.

               NUCLEAR CHEMICAL BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE REPORT (CBDRT)

A4.1. Reporting CBDRT C-Level. An inherent part of every unit’s mission is the ability to survive and
operate in a nuclear, biological or chemical (NBC) contaminated environment. IAW CJCSM 3150.02,
Global Status of Resource and Training Systems (GSORTS), all SORTS measured units are required to
provide a separate readiness assessment in a CBDRT based on the unit’s ability to perform its wartime
mission for up to 96 hours IAW AFMAN 10-2602, Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, Conventional (NBCC)
Defense Operations and Standards, in a NBC environment. This assessment is based on measurements of
MRA NBC defense equipment and the status of individual and unit level NBCC defense training.
      A4.1.1. The separate CBDRT report will be submitted concurrent with the unit’s primary SORTS
      report. The CBDRT includes an overall C-level rating, measured area level ratings for (1) NBC
      defense equipment and supplies and (2) NBCC defense training, and accompanying remarks to report
      a unit’s capability to perform its wartime mission in NBC conditions. These measured area ratings are
      specific to the unit’s NBC defense requirements and are to be reported in the CBDRT TREAD report.
      The CBDRT report may be a factor in the commander’s assessment of the unit’s primary overall
      SORTS C-level; however, CBDRT-specified calculation/measurements will not be reported in the
      regular SORTS reports. Units shall use AFSORTSDET version 1.3.8.9 or later to create the CBDRT
      SORTS report.
      A4.1.2. Measured units with no NBC defense equipment or training requirements must still submit a
      CBDRT report. They should report an overall C-5 with a S-6 in the equipment and a T-6 in the train-
      ing areas with a REASON code of “N” IAW AFI 10-201, Table A4.5. Also see paragraphs A4.2.2.
      and A4.3.1.

A4.2. NBC Defense Equipment and Supplies On-Hand Rating (ESRAT). The ESRAT is based on
the percentage of wartime NBC defense equipment that is MRA divided by the quantity of NBC equip-
ment required. The Equipment and Supplies area of the CBDRT report is broken down into six categories
of equipment (most units will report only Category 1) as shown in Table A4.1. Report the ESRAT IAW
Table A4.3. and enter the appropriate rating (S-level), based on the lowest calculated equipment category
that applies to the unit. For a CBDRT S-level below S-1, state the reasons in the ESRES remark field of
the CBDRT. Include the applicable supply reason code (Table 4.5.). If a unit does not have a requirement
for a specific category of NBC defense equipment, then enter a “0” in that CBDRT equipment category.
      A4.2.1. Reporting ESRAT Percentages. All applicable units will list percentages for each category
      listed on the AFSORTSDET CBDRT page. Once information is filled in, and percentages are com-
      puted and accepted, a CBDRT ESRAT Remark is automatically formatted. Example of an automatic
      ESRAT Remark follows:

     A4.2.1.1. For the detection category, enter only the data for the detection group with the lowest
     percentage MRA.
     A4.2.1.2. Do not enter data in S07 through S10. These entries area generated by the AFSORTS-
     DET program, but are NOT used.
  A4.2.2. Enter plain text remarks identifying deficiencies and get well actions under the CBDRT
  ESRES remark field. The following is an unclassified example of an AFSORTSDET formatted
  ESRES remark:


  LABEL/U/A/LABEL:ESRES//
  GENTEXT/RMK/YYMMDD CATEGORY 1 SHORTAGE OF 27 C-1 MOBILITY
  BAGS. ADDRESSED TO MAJCOM FOR FURTHER ACTION.
  Estimated get-well date: DDMMMYY//


  A4.2.3. No Equipment Requirements. Units in a nuclear, biological, chemical, and conventional
  (NBCC) low threat area (LTA) (NBCC threat areas are explained in AFI 10-2501, Full Spectrum
  Threat Response (FSTR) Planning and Operations) with only an in-place mission, as identified by
  their DOC Statement or tasking system, have no NBC defense equipment requirements, unless other-
  wise specified by their MAJCOM. In this case, the unit should report a “6” for the Equipment and
  Supplies subarea in the CBDRT report and “SNM “ in ESRES.
  A4.2.4. Reportable NBC Equipment. (Table A4.1. can be used by MAJCOM FAMs to determine
  what categories their units should measure and report. The FAMs should identify which categories
  units are to measure and report within the add/ remark section of the unit’s DOC Statement.) The spe-
  cific equipment items to measure in each category are listed in Table A4.2. Requirements vary based
  on unit mission and location. For units with both an in-place (generation) and a mobility mission,
  combine the requirements for reporting. Baseline Equipment Data Assessment List (BEDAL) equip-
  ment for first responders to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) incidents is not included in the
  CBDRT. The six equipment categories and applicable clarifications follow.

      A4.2.4.1. Category 1 - Individual Protective Equipment (IPE). Count the number of C-1 and D/
      D-1 bags that are MRA, divided by the number required. AFI 10-2501, Table 8.1 lists the required
      contents of C-1 bags. AFI 11-301V1, Aircrew Life Support (ALS) Program, lists the required con-
      tents of D/D-1 bags. To be MRA, a bag must contain 100 percent of required items and each item
      must be serviceable IAW the applicable technical guidance. This 100 percent availability criteria
      is only for SORTS reporting. Unit commanders should follow guidance in AFI 10-403 and other
      MAJCOM guidance in determining risk of deploying individuals with partial IPE. Paragraphs
      A4.2.4.1.1. through A4.2.4.1.4. identify unit IPE requirements by location. Paragraphs A4.2.4.1.5.
      and A4.2.4.1.7. provide specific measurement and reporting instructions.
         A4.2.4.1.1. Continental United States (CONUS) units with a mobility mission or dual
         in-place and mobility mission: unit C-1 mobility bag requirements are established by AFI
         10-2501 and MAJCOM guidance and should provide for every person assigned to a deploy-
         able UTC listed in Part IIc of the DOC Statement. When directed by the MAJCOM, flying
         units must have one D-bag equivalent for each aircrew member assigned to UTCs listed in the
         unit DOC Statement.
         A4.2.4.1.2. Outside CONUS (OCONUS) units in LTAs:
             A4.2.4.1.2.1. For a mobility mission, the unit must have the equivalent of one C-1 bag for
             every person assigned to a deployable UTC listed in Part IIC of the unit’s DOC Statement.
             As directed by MAJCOM, flying units must also have one D-1 and one D-bag equivalent
             for each assigned aircrew member IAW AFI 11-301, Vol 1.
             A4.2.4.1.2.2. For an in-place (generation) mission, there are no requirements.
         A4.2.4.1.3. OCONUS units in medium threat areas (MTAs):
             A4.2.4.1.3.1. For the mobility mission, the unit has a requirement of one C-1 bag equiva-
             lent for every person assigned to a deployable UTC listed in Part IIC of the unit DOC
             Statement.
             A4.2.4.1.3.2. For an in-place (generation) mission, a unit has a requirement of a C-1
             mobility bag equivalent for all military and emergency essential civilian personnel
             assigned to the unit IAW AFI 10-2501.
             A4.2.4.1.3.3. As directed by the MAJCOM, flying units require one D-bag equivalent for
             each assigned aircrew member IAW AFI 11-301, Vol 1.
         A4.2.4.1.4. OCONUS units in high threat areas (HTAs):
             A4.2.4.1.4.1. Units have a requirement of a C-1 bag equivalent for all military and emer-
             gency essential civilian personnel assigned to the unit IAW AFI 10-2501.
             A4.2.4.1.4.2. As directed by the MAJCOM, flying units require one D-bag equivalent for
             each assigned aircrew member IAW AFI 11-301, Vol 1.
         A4.2.4.1.5. Instructions for units that get their C-1 mobility bags from an LRS: MAJCOMs
         will provide guidance to their reporting units on how to count and report on centrally stored
         bags. Use these criteria when preparing that guidance:
             A4.2.4.1.5.1. To provide consistency in reporting, the supporting LRS should calculate a
             base wide IPE availability percentage for centrally managed bags. This is calculated by
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                  311


            dividing total MRA bags and bag equivalents by the total required (see paragraph
            A4.2.3.1.5.3. to establish the total centrally managed requirement). This percentage should
            be provided to all appropriate units to use in their CBDRT SORTS report. The supporting
            LRS must count the number of MRA tariff and individually sized bags that are or could be
            built up with resources O/H.
            A4.2.4.1.5.2. Units should report their unit IPE requirement (percentage of bags avail-
            able) based on the LRS-provided percentage of available IPE. Units multiply the LRS-pro-
            vided percentage by the number of bags required to determine the number of “unit bags” to
            report as available/O/H.
            A4.2.4.1.5.3. Centrally managed requirements will be a sum of all unit requirements (as
            outlined in paragraphs A4.2.3.1. through A4.2.3.4.) minus requirements for units that man-
            age their own bags. All OCONUS units in MTAs and HTAs have C-1 bag requirements,
            but some of those units are not required to submit SORTS reports. Be sure to include the
            C-1 bag requirements for those units in this centrally managed total, unless those units
            manage their own bags. Per AFI 10-2501, the Installation Readiness Working Group will
            provide the total IPE requirements to the supporting LRS.
            A4.2.4.1.5.4. One bag or bag equivalent can be used to satisfy no more than one require-
            ment. The total number of centrally stored bags reported available for all units, cannot
            exceed the number of complete bags (or bag equivalents) that are available in central stor-
            age plus the number of bags that have been issued to currently deployed personnel.
            A4.2.4.1.5.5. Count bags issued for real world deployments as available.
            A4.2.4.1.5.6. MAJCOMs can provide additional procedures in cases where C-1 bag allo-
            cation is applied to priority units on a base.
        A4.2.4.1.6. Flying units must report IPE requirements for all required aircrew, ground crew
        and direct support unit personnel—not just on aircrew.
        A4.2.4.1.7. See paragraph A4.2.1. on reporting percentage information.
     A4.2.4.2. Category 2 - Detection Equipment. Count the detection and monitoring equipment
     listed in Table A4.2., Column B, for UTCs listed in the unit DOC Statement and for in-place base
     support in MTAs and HTAs (do not include C-1 bag detection items (i.e., M8 and M9 paper) in
     this category). To count as MRA, category 2 equipment must have enough serviceable batteries
     and support equipment O/H to support operations for up to 96 hours IAW AFMAN 10-2602.
     Divide MRA equipment by total number required for each detection group in this category. Report
     the category status based on the detection group with the lowest percent available. UTC require-
     ments are listed in LOGFOR, AS, and/or HQ USAF functional area guidance.
        A4.2.4.2.1. MAJCOMs must specify in-place base support requirements for units in MTAs
        and HTAs.
        A4.2.4.2.2. See paragraph A4.2.1. on reporting percentage information.
     A4.2.4.3. Category 3 - Decontamination Equipment. Count decontamination equipment listed in
     Table A4.2., column B, for UTCs listed in the unit DOC Statement and for in-place base support
     in MTAs and HTAs (do not include C-1 mobility bag detection items, i.e., M291 and M295 decon-
312                                                         AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006


         tamination kits in this category). Divide MRA equipment by total number required. UTC require-
         ments are listed in LOGFORs, ASs, and/or HQ USAF functional area guidance.
             A4.2.4.3.1. MAJCOMs must specify in-place base support decontamination equipment
             requirements for units in MTAs and HTAs.
             A4.2.4.3.2. See paragraph A4.2.1. on reporting percentage information.
         A4.2.4.4. Category 4 - Radiation, Detection, Indication, and Computation (RADIAC) equipment.
         Count RADIAC equipment listed in Table A4.2., column B, for UTCs listed in the unit DOC
         Statement and for in-place base support in MTAs and HTAs. Divide MRA by total number
         required. To count as available, Category 4 equipment must have the required serviceable batter-
         ies and support equipment O/H. UTC requirements are listed in LOGFORs, ASs, and/or HQ
         USAF functional area guidance.
             A4.2.4.4.1. MAJCOMs must specify in-place base support equipment requirements for units
             in MTAs and HTAs.
             A4.2.4.4.2. See paragraph A4.2.1. on reporting percentage information.
         A4.2.4.5. Category 5 - Medical Countermeasures. See paragraph A4.2.5.1.5.
         A4.2.4.6. Category 6 - Collective Protection. Count the number of transportable collective pro-
         tection systems, in Table A4.2., column B, that are MRA. Divide by total number required. To
         count as MRA, a collective protection system must have 100 percent of the critical components
         (those that are needed to make the system fully operational). All critical components must be ser-
         viceable in accordance with technical data on the report date. UTC requirements are listed in
         LOGFORs, ASs, and/or HQ USAF functional area guidance. See paragraph A4.2.1. on reporting
         percentage information.
      A4.2.5. Reportable Medical NBC Equipment. Medical units will report their equipment UTCs as fol-
      lows:
         A4.2.5.1. In cases of more than one item for a given field, enter the lowest percentage. Report
         only on equipment and supplies the unit is required to maintain. For units that possess no CBDRT
         material, as described below, report codes S-6 in ESRAT and SNM in ESRES. For categories two
         and three, do not report those items contained in C-1 bags. If the medical logistics (MEDLOG)/
         defense medical logistics standard support (DMLSS) end-of-month (EOM) Stock Status Report
         reflects WRM project at zero percent, it represents a requirement with no material O/H and should
         be reported as such. UTCs that contain equipment in categories two, three, and four will still
         report their overall Material Availability Percentage (MAP) in the unit SORTS report in addition
         to the itemized reporting in the CBDRT portion of their SORTS report.
             A4.2.5.1.1. Category One - Medical IPE Equipment. Follow guidance in A4.2.4.1.
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                    313


        A4.2.5.1.2. Category Two - Medical Detection Equipment. Medical units will report the low-
        est total material readiness percentage of the three detection groups assigned to the unit (using

             A4.2.5.1.6. Category 6 - Medical Collective Protection. Medical units will calculate percent-
             ages for UTCs; FFCPA, FFCPB, FFCPC, FFCPD, and FFCPW, whose critical equipment
             MAPs are at 100 percent (using the MEDLOG inquire WRM balance (IWB) transaction or
             DMLSS Assemblage Status Report, Gross Readiness Percentage (use the ESRAT)). If the crit-
             ical equipment material availability percentage is less than 100 percent, the equipment is not
             considered MRA, and will be reported at zero percent, regardless of how much of the other
             material in the UTC is O/H. Divide the total number of these UTCs that are MRA by the num-
             ber of UTCS required, and multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage to be reported under the
             ESRAT label.


             Example Calculations:
             FFCPA Critical O/H = 100 percent (MRA, count as 1)
             FFCPB Critical O/H = 99 percent (Not MRA, count as 0)
             FFCPW Critical O/H = 100 percent (MRA, count as 1)


             UTCs O/H/UTCs Required = percent
              2                  3     = 67 percent (report in ESSA6)

A4.3. Individual and Unit NBCC Defense Training Rating (TRRAT). The training portion of the
CBDRT report has two categories: individual NBCC defense training and unit NBCC defense task quali-
fication training (TQT). Determine the percent of personnel (or crews) who are current in each training
category. Based on the category with the lowest percent available, report NBCC defense training status
IAW Table A4.4. and enter the appropriate T-level rating (TRRAT). TRRAT is calculated IAW applicable
training methods of Chapter 6, Method B (paragraph 6.2.); Method C, Option 1 (paragraph 6.3.), or
Method C, Option 2 (paragraph 6.4.). For units measuring under Method C, Option 2, use Table 6.3. Fly-
ing units shall report training status for all required aircrews, ground crews and direct support unit person-
nel. For a CBDRT T-level below T-1, insert the applicable training reason code (from Table 6.5.) in the
TRRES field and explain the reasons in TRRES remarks. If a unit does not have a requirement for a spe-
cific category of NBCC defense training, then enter a “0” in the required category.
      A4.3.1. No Training Requirements. Units in LTAs with only an in-place mission have no NBCC
      defense training requirements, unless otherwise specified by their MAJCOM. In this case, the unit
      should report a “6” representing a non measured training subarea in the CBDRT report and TNM in
      TREAS.
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                   315


   A4.3.2. Individual NBCC Defense Training. Count the number of military and emergency-essential
   civilian personnel who are current in individual NBCC Defense Training, divided by the total number
   of personnel assigned who are required to have the training (AFI 10-2501).
       A4.3.2.1. Units with a mobility mission: Every person assigned to a deployable UTC as listed in
       Part IIC of the unit’s DOC Statement is required to be current in this training.
       A4.3.2.2. Units assigned in either MTAs or HTAs: Every military and emergency-essential civil-
       ian assigned to the unit must be current in this training.
   A4.3.3. Unit NBCC Defense Task Qualification Training (TQT). Count the number of military and
   emergency-essential civilian personnel who are current in NBCC Defense TQT, divided by the total
   number of assigned personnel required to have the training. General NBCC Defense TQT require-
   ments are listed in AFI 10-2501 and AFMAN 10-2602. To be TQT trained, unit personnel must be
   task trained using the general and functional NBCC defense tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP)
   listed in AFMAN 10-2602, Attachment 4, all published HQ USAF functional area TTPs per AFMAN
   10-2602, paragraph A4.1.2, and all unit identified TTPs per AFI 10-2501, paragraphs 2.11.2, 9.3.5,
   and 9.7.8.
   A4.3.4. The lowest percentage of paragraph A4.3.2. or A4.3.3. is used to assign a training level
   (T-level) under the TRRAT field IAW Table A4.4. State the reasons for a below T-1 status in the
   TRRES field and the applicable training reason code from Table 6.5.
   A4.3.5. Training Remarks. TRRAT remarks are automatically formatted by the AFSORTSDET
   CBDRT page and list number of personnel who require training, the number who are current in their
   training, and the percent of personnel complete and current for each training category (individual
   NBC defense and unit level TQT). In plain text English, TRRES remarks should explain deficiencies
   and get well actions. The following are examples of the AFSORTSDET formatted remarks:

A4.4. Special NBC Defense Equipment and Supplies Reporting Requirements. To provide visibility
to installation-wide requirements and capabilities, CE units have an additional special CBDRT reporting

requirement. MAJCOMs will specify this special reporting requirement in Section IV of a unit’s SORTS
DOC Statement.
      A4.4.1. OCONUS CE Units in NBCC MTAs and HTAs. Once each quarter (in January, April, July,
      and October), report the status of in-place collective protection assets.
         A4.4.1.1. For an in-place mission in MTAs and HTAs, list the number of collective protection
         spaces that are required and the number that are MRA. To count as MRA, the shelter must be fully
         operational (see AFMAN 10-2602). If it is not, none of the spaces in that shelter can count as
         MRA.
         A4.4.1.2. MAJCOMs must specify in-place requirements. If theater or MAJCOM guidance is not
         provided, units should report MRA, rest and relief collective spaces for 30 percent (assumes each
         space will support two people over a 24-hour period) of the in-place and deployed AF personnel
         plus the number of collective protection spaces used in medical, command and control, and other
         function-specific facilities. MAJCOMs will provide guidance as to how many additional spaces to
         include for the protection of transient aircrew and passengers into the collective protection calcu-
         lation. Use any combination of Class I-IV transportable, fixed facility, or expedient collective pro-
         tection systems to satisfy the total requirement. Do not include collective protection systems
         assigned to deployable UTCs. (See AFMAN 10-2602.)
         A4.4.1.3. In an ESRES remark, provide both the required and the MRA number of collective pro-
         tection spaces. If reporting in-place requirements, this remark and the report must be classified
         SECRET. The following is an Unclassified example of the AFSORTSDET CBDRT formatted
         remark:

A4.5. Overall CBDRT C-level. Unit Commanders will assign an overall CBDRT C-level based on the
lowest of the ESRAT and TRRAT. CBDRT overall C-level is assigned based on definitions in paragraph
1.12., relevant to the unit’s ability to operate in CB conditions. An overall C-level will be entered in the
READY field under TREAD = CBDRT report. If applicable, a primary reason (in plain text) should be
stated under the CBDRT TREAD REASN remark label, while using an applicable reason code from
Table 4.5. and Table 6.5. for the area ratings. CBDRT reports will be submitted in conjunction with the
unit’s primary SORTS report. Commander CBDRT assessments are not applicable to CBDRT reports,
however the CBDRT overall rating can be factored into commander assessments of overall unit readiness
in the primary unit SORTS reports. An example AFSORTSDET CBDRT overall set is shown below:


OVERALL/U/A/RICDA:YYMMDD/TREAD:CBDRT/READY:3/REASN:S/-/-// EQSUPPLY/
ESRAT:3/ESRES:SRA//
TRAINING/TRRAT:2/TRRES:TNB//

A4.6. CBDRT Data Requirements. Table 4.5. and Table 6.5. list applicable reason codes for use with
CBDRT. No FORECAST Set data is required. Only applicable Equipment and Training reason codes
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                     317


listed in Table 4.5. and Table 6.5. will be used for CBDRT overall and subarea level ratings (S-level, and
T-level). Use the REASN code from Table A4.5. for the CBDRT overall rating.

       MAJOR EQUIPMENT LOCATION AND CREW INFORMATION (MEQLOCN)

A5.1. MEQLOCN Description
   A5.1.1. MEQLOCN is a major equipment location set reported in SORTS for those units possessing
   major equipment (aircraft, missiles, etc.)
   A5.1.2. MEQLOCN is used to report the location and status of major equipment items and crews
   authorized to the unit.
      A5.1.2.1. Includes MEQPT and crew status at a unit’s present and deployed locations.
      A5.1.2.2. Equipment and crews that will be off station for less than 72 hours (with response time
      not a key factor) are not considered deployed and do not need to be reported in a separate
      MEQLOCN set.
      A5.1.2.3. Major equipment in PDM are not reported in a separate MEQLOCN set, account for
      major equipment in PDM in a remark using the “MEPSD” Label.

A5.2. Reporting Information
   A5.2.1. MEQLOCN sets report on the type of equipment, the number of crews at a given location,
   and the location of deployed equipment and/or crews.
   A5.2.2. Total numbers, reported for unit resource data (equipment and crews), at various locations
   must equal total assigned, possessed, formed, and mission ready.
   A5.2.3. MEQLOCN sets are reported as a stand alone set of a unit’s SORTS report. A unit will
   develop and maintain their MEQLOCN set(s) using the current AFSORTSDET version.
      A5.2.3.1. Submit the MEQLOCN set on a unit authorized or possessing major equipment items.
      Submit the set for each combination of major equipment, type, and location to show status at all
      locations being occupied by the unit. There is no limit to the number of MEQLOCN sets a unit
      may report.
      A5.2.3.2. MEQLOCN sets are reported using an Add, Change or Delete set transaction code. The
      Add transaction code should ONLY be used the very first time a MEQLOCN set is added to the
      database. Any subsequent reporting of the MEQLOCN sets that are changing data should utilize
      the Change transaction. If the set is to be deleted, the Delete transaction code is used. If a unit con-
      tinuously uses the Add transaction code, the number of equipment and crews will constantly dou-
      ble with each report, causing the unit’s database to have incorrect data.
      A5.2.3.3. When submitting MEQLOCN sets, units should ensure the numbers of deployed crews
      or equipment do not exceed the total number possessed, and change accordingly. SORTS report-
      ing personnel must know what is in the database for the UIC being reported.
      A5.2.3.4. When a unit deletes the number of previously reported equipment at deployed loca-
      tions, the system will return equipment numbers back to the home or UNIT location.
      A5.2.3.5. Units should ensure that the proper security classification value is applied to each
      MEQLOCN set every time it is reported.

        TRANSPORTABLE COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL DATA.
                    (UTC PACKAGE DEPLOYABILITY STATUS)

A6.1. Required Actions:
      A6.1.1. Identify the package being reported on. Units may be required to provide a number of the
      same UTC packages. To uniquely identify a package, enter two secondary control elements according
      to the following:
         A6.1.1.1. Check the DOC Statement for the UTC. Enter it under the label UTC each time there’s
         a “PACKAGE” transaction.
         A6.1.1.2. Find the Designated Item Serial Number using the following rules and enter it under the
         Designated Item Serial Number (MESEN) label each time there’s a “PACKAGE” transaction.
             A6.1.1.2.1. For Equipment and Personnel UTCs check for a force requirement number (FRN)
             in plan’s time-phased force and deployment data (TPFDD). If there’s an FRN, use its first
             three characters as the first three characters and a sequence number (e.g., 1, 2, etc.) as the last
             character of the MESEN. If there isn’t an FRN, use a four-digit sequence number (e.g., 0001,
             0002, etc.).
             A6.1.1.2.2. For Equipment UTCs use the first four characters of the major equipment’s serial
             number as MESEN.
             A6.1.1.2.3. For Personnel UTCs use “P” as the first character and a three-digit sequence num-
             ber as the last three characters (e.g., P001, P002, etc.) of MESEN.
         A6.1.1.3. For the DOC Listed UTC(s) enter a “Y” if tasked or an “N” if not tasked, under label
         DTASK.
      A6.1.2. Show Major Equipment Operational Status for Specified Package. Commanders will select
      the operational status in Table A6.1., which most closely matches the current status of the prime
      equipment required by the package. If changed, enter it under label Prime Equipment Operational Sta-
      tus (PEQS). If status is other than “not applicable” or “prime equipment is fully operational,” forecast
      the date the equipment will be fully operational. If changed, enter it under label PEQFR.
      A6.1.3. Show Support Equipment Operational for Specified Package. Commanders will select the
      operational status in Table A6.2., which most closely matches the current status of the support equip-
      ment required by the package. If changed, enter it under label Support Equipment Status (SEDY). If
      status is other than ”not applicable” or “support equipment is fully operational,” forecast the date the
      equipment will be fully operational. If changed, enter it under label Support Equipment Forecast
      Ready Date (SEQFR).
      A6.1.4. Show the Assigned Team Status for Specified Package. Commanders will select the team sta-
      tus in Table A6.3., which most closely matches the status of the personnel required by the specified
      package. If changed, enter it under the label for Assigned Team Status (TEDY). If status is other than
      “not applicable” or “assigned team status is satisfactory,” forecast the date the team will be opera-
      tional. If changed, enter it under the label for Team Status Satisfactory Forecast Date (TEAFR).
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                   327


  A6.1.5. Show the Overall Operational Condition and Deployment Status of Specified UTC Package.
  Commanders will select the overall operational condition and deployability status in Table A6.4.,
  which most closely matches the current status of the specified package. If changed, enter it under the
  Expected Availability Category (EXDAC) label. If the status is:
     A6.1.5.1. UTC is redeployable, deployed, or en route, check the actual deployment date. If
     changed, enter it under the label for UTC Forecast Ready Date (UTCFR).
     A6.1.5.2. UTC is committed, forecast the deployment date. If changed, enter in UTCFR.
     A6.1.5.3. Either of the above, show status of the deployed or committed UTCs. If a UTC is
     deployed or committed to deploy, report this data depending on the status showing using the
     EXDAC field:
         A6.1.5.3.1. In the Deployment Control Number (DCN), if reporting that the UTC is deployed,
         committed, or en route, check the deployment tasking number, departure control number, or
         deployment control number issued by the MAJCOM for the specified UTC package move-
         ment. If the number is unknown, use “XXXXX” as the number. If changed, enter it under label
         DCNDY.
         A6.1.5.3.2. For Equipment Return Date, if reporting UTC is redeployable, committed,
         deployed, or en route, forecast the date the specified package is expected to return from
         deployment. If changed, enter it under the label for Equipment Return Date (EQRET).
         A6.1.5.3.3. For GEOLOC Code, if reporting UTC is redeployable, committed, deployed, or
         en route, find the GEOLOC code matching the specified package’s present location in the
         GEOFILE. If changed, enter it under the label for Geographical Location of Equipment
         (GEOGR).
     A6.1.5.4. Other than those above, or if the UTC is fully operational and deployable, forecast the
     date the package will be operational and deployable. Anytime the EXDAC is other than “A” enter
     it under the label UTCFR.
  A6.1.6. Prepare remarks to explain the situation. When they occur, prepare remarks to explain any of
  the situations listed below. Don’t duplicate remarks if situations have same explanations.
     A6.1.6.1. When specified UTCs have sub-elements deployed state which sub-elements are
     deployed, the deployment number, the estimated return date, and the UTC operational capability
     remaining. Create the remark under the label EXDAC.
     A6.1.6.2. When a unit has major equipment deficiencies explain the impact the deficiencies have
     on UTC operational and deployment capability, also identify corrective actions taken. Create the
     remark under the PEQS label.
     A6.1.6.3. When a unit has support equipment deficiencies explain the impact the deficiencies
     have on UTC operational and deployment capability, also identify corrective actions taken. Create
     the remark under the SEDY label.
     A6.1.6.4. When a unit has personnel deficiencies explain the impact the deficiencies have on
     UTC operational and deployment capability, also identify corrective actions taken. Create the
     remark under the TEDY label.

      A6.1.7. Submit “PACKAGE” with the unit SORTS report. Ensure accurate data is reflected each
      time a unit SORTS report is submitted. Take add, delete, or change action as necessary.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision incorporates IC 2006-1 and aligns this guidance with CJCSM 3105.02A, GLOBAL STA-
TUS OF RESOURCES AND TRAINING SYSTEM (GSORTS). IC 2006-1 updates paragraphs 1.2.,
1.4.3., 1.6.4., 2.7., 2.7.1., 2.7.3., 4.3., 4.3.1., 4.3.1.1., 4.3.1.2., 4.3.1.3., 4.3.1.4., 4.3.1.5., A3.1.2., A3.4.,
A3.5.1., and Table 3.1., Table 4.1., Table 4.4., Table 4.11., Table 5.1., Table 5.4., Table 5.18., Table
5.27., Table 6.4., Table A2.3., Table A3.1., Table A3.2., Table A3.3.. IC 2006-1 inserts paragraph
1.10.8.1.4. and deletes Table 5.28. and Table 6.13.. This change also clarifies the use of the Percent Effec-
tive Field. A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from the previous edition.

1.2. Measured Units Reporting Requirement. Measured units are all planned and actual (JTF) HQs,
combat, combat support, combat services support units including Active, Air National Guard, AF
Reserves and provisional units apportioned to or deployed in support of a CJCS or combatant com-
mand-directed OPLAN, Concept Plans, SIOP, Operations Plan 8044 Revision 03 or Volume 3 of the
USAF War and Mobilization Plan (WMP-3), or assigned in the “Forces For Unified Commands” docu-
ment. Measured units will be named on a DOC Statement (DOCS) and must report SORTS in accordance
with their DOCS. One exception is training units that report only Major Equipment Location and Crew
Information (MEQLOCN). Measured unit SORTS reporting begins as soon as possible after a unit acti-
vates and continues until the unit deactivates.


1.4.3. SORTS Readiness Data. Measured area category levels, overall category levels, numbers used to
compute percentages and the percentages (when associated with SORTS), reason codes associated with
their remarks, and limiting factors for a single unit, are, at a minimum, classified CONFIDENTIAL. Prod-
ucts that contain data from two or more measured units is classified SECRET NOFORN. Additionally,
individuals classifying SORTS reports must consider other classification guidance including OPLANS.
The association of the unit with its OPLAN(s) tasking is classified at the level of classification of the
OPLAN(s), usually SECRET. Information that is not SORTS based and does not show a deficiency may
still require classification through channels other than SORTS. Unit and Wing Security Managers should
be consulted in these events.
1.6.4. General Status Organization and Location (ORGLOCN). ORGLOCN applies to all registered units,
includes codes for CC/Service Command (CSERV), commands with Operational Control (OPCON),

Administrative Control (ADCON), unit’s Home Geographical Location (HOGEO) and Present Geo-
graphical Location (PRGEO), Activity Code (ACTIV), and Percent Effective (PCTEF). Only CROs
report this data with the exception of PCTEF, which is reported by the measured unit.


1.10.8.1.4. Availability of contractors to provide services in support of generation mission.


2.7. Use of the Percent Effective (PCTEF) Field.
PCTEF provides a subjective assessment of the unit’s ability to execute its currently assigned nontradi-
tional mission. When employed in support of a nontraditional mission, commanders will report PCTEF.
PCTEF reporting is required upon receipt of an order to execute any of the following missions: Homeland
Defense or Homeland Security missions in support of USNORTHCOM and USPACOM (including quick
reaction force and/or ready reaction force missions), peacekeeeping or peace enforcement operations,
humanitarian assistance, consequence management, counterdrug operations, civil distrubance operations,
and natural disaster relief operations (including wildfire fighting missions). In some cases, a unit execut-
ing assigned nontraditional operation will be executing its wartime tasks in support of that nontraditional
mission (e.g., a Civil Engineering unit providing support to a natural disaster relief operation). In those
cases, commanders will use their discretion to determine if PCTEF reporting is required.
2.7.1. PCTEF will not necessarily correlate with a unit’s Overall C-level. For example, if the unit is cur-
rently assigned a nontraditional mission, PCTEF will capture the commander’s assessment against this
nontraditional mission while the Overall C-level will continue to assess the unit’s ability to execute its full
wartime tasking(s). To report the impact on a unit’s C-level from deployed resources, commanders needs
to use DEFG (see paragraph 2.8.).
2.7.3. Commander’s remarks are mandatory when reporting in the PCTEF field. Using plain text under
the PCTEF label, identify the mission assigned (e.g., Tsunami Relief Operations.) current status, and/or
any action underway or planned to remedy a current reduced readiness condition for assigned missions.
Format the PCTEF remark according to the example below:
   Percent Effective (2), Tsunami Relief Operations, status reflects reduced/increased effectiveness due
   to reason(s), e.g., Tsunami Relief Operations deployment tasking cannot be fully supported due to
   shortage of (personnel, equipment and supplies o/h, equipment condition, and/or training). To allevi-
   ate the situation on (area), the unit will (action). Get well date (gwd) is estimated to be (date). Esti-
   mated departure/return date is (date).

NOTES:
1. X means all AFSCs in source that match remaining characters are critical AFSCs. * means all suffixed
and non-suffixed AFSCs in the source document that match remaining characters are critical. Consider
AFSCs that convert as critical.
2. HQ AF/A3OR, as authorized may augment this table by message. MAJCOM SORTS offices will dis-
seminate the supplemented message to subordinate units.
3. Rule 2 Aeromedical units use “X” as a prefix to identify flight qualification. In this case, “X” does not
have the same significance as in note 1 above.
4. Rule 21 AFSC 6C091 may be substituted for a 64P3.
5. Rule 13 Number of personnel tasked under UTC is listed on unit DOC Statement. Two mobility posi-
tions for AFSC 2S0X1 fall under UTC XFBPF, however, the second position is non-critical.
6. Rule 13 Four of the 13 mobility positions per XFBJ1 UTC are critical. The remaining nine positions,
regardless of AFSC, are non-critical.
7. Rule 13 The mobility position per XFBKB UTC is critical.
8. Rule 13 Both of the mobility positions per XFBYC UTC are critical and will not be substituted.
9. Rule 13 One of the three mobility positions per JFBBS UTC. Remaining two positions are not critical.
10. Rule 32 Aircraft operations support, theater hub (non-aircraft), depot munitions activity (STAMP/
TARRP), and units providing nuclear capabilities.
11. Rule 24 Emergency essential and key DOD civilians must be identified and coded as such in their
position description.


4.3. Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) General Policy. BEAR units report SORTS data
against stated SORTS DOC Statement mission. Each unit must determine and report their status on the
basis of critical BEAR equipment and supplies (support) assigned. Report using only the assets the unit is
authorized. Specific equipment allowances are included in AFI 25-101, Chap 7 “USAF Bear Base Sys-
tems,” and in AS 157, 158 and 159.

1. Consider availability of appropriate Promina trunk cards (S/A and TRK-3) and logic modules (PLM), network timing, encryption.
2. Consider availability of appropriate Promina user cards (Data and voice processing) and external routers.
3. Measure availability of critical network management tools: Air Force Network Management tool (e.g. HP Open View, Smarts-In-Charge,
Cisco Works, Foundry Iron View, etc.), Remote Internetworking Device Management tool (e.g. Systems Management Server, Remote Access
Terminal Services [RATS], etc.)
4. Measure availability of critical information protection tools: Firewall, Proxy server, Internal control tools, intrusion detection tools.
5. Measure availability of critical core services: Messaging, E-mail, Domain Name System (DNS), Active Directory Domain Controllers,
Dynamic Host Control, Protocol (DHCP) server, E-mail relays, storage devices, backups, Web Server.
6. Compute based on total capacity (in-use and spare) of assigned switches.
7. Compute based on number of available information transfer nodes.
8. Compute based on number of facilities served by base cable and fiber plant.
9. Compute ERSA1 percentage by selecting lowest score of all areas measured herein. Where a rating crosses two scores (e.g. 1 SDP trunk),
assume higher score unless driven lower by another area.

NOTES:
1. Rule 24 Report based on the combined total percentage of UTC-tasked NCC personnel who've com-
pleted the training as specified. However, if any of the following six categories are more than one T-level
different from the combined average, report the lowest level of those categories.
a. Crew Commander
b. Operations Controller
c. Help Desk Technician
d. Network Management (includes Network Services Technician and Infrastructure Technician crew
positions)
e. Network Administration (includes Messaging Technician, Application Services Technician, and Con-
figuration Management Technician crew positions)
f. Information Protection (includes Boundary Protection Specialist, Intrusion Detection Specialist, and
Vulnerability Assessment Specialist crew positions)


2. Rule 24 Report based on the combined total percentage of UTC-tasked NOSC personnel who've com-
pleted the training as specified. However, if any of the following nine categories are more than one
T-level different from the combined average, report the lowest level of those categories.
a. Crew Commander
b. Operations Controller
c. Event Manager

3. Rule 15 BMC, CMR and SPECAP subcategories apply only to Rule 15, Combat Air Forces.
4. Rule 19 For those units with a Combat Camera (COMCAM) or Visual Information (VI) mobility mis-
sion, members must complete the COMCAM Contingency Support course at least once. Such training is
considered valid as long as the member is assigned to subsequent COMCAM or VI units. Assignment
outside such a mobility environment not including extended TDYs, short tours or specialized training
under one year nullifies currency of this training, requiring the member to re-accomplish. COMCAM and/
or VI unit commanders may, at their discretion, choose to send members to the training beyond the mini-
mum requirement as readiness dictates. Air Force Aircrew Survival Training (for appropriately qualified
aircrew personnel) may substitute for the COMCAM Contingency Support course, consistent with the
rules described above.
5. Rule 12 Training must include a command approved ABDR; engineer, general assessor, technical
course, and support at least one CLSS field exercise (Hardstand) as an engineer.
6. Rule 43 TACS will be considered current if they meet all air-strike control currency requirements to
include Night, Live, Laser, and basic TAC requisites (IAW AFI 13-112, Vol 1).
7. Rule 43 Units will include TRUTC remark to report the total number of combat mission ready JTACS
broken out by officer and enlisted numbers.
8. Rule 32a Aircraft assigned and directly support aircraft operations; excludes nuclear support equip-
ment.
9. Rule 32b Munitions service-level and theater swing-stock support activity (non-aircraft; even if stocks
support aircraft; theater hubs, STAMP, TARP)

Terms
Measured Units (Reporting Units) All planned and actual JTF HQs, combat, combat support and com-
bat service support units of the operating forces, including Active duty, AF Reserve, and Air National
Guard, and provisional units apportioned to or deployed in support of a CJCS or combatant com-
mand-directed OPLAN, CONPLAN, SIOP, Service war planning document or assigned in the “Forces
For Unified Commands” document are designated as measured units (units that report SORTS).


Registered Units Units that have the potential to support, by deployment or otherwise, a CJCS or com-
batant command-directed operations plan, contingency plan, Single Integrated Operations Plan , or con-
tingency operation. These units (which do not report SORTS) are registered in GSORTS through the
BIDE and ORGLOCN sets.

A3.1.2. Provisional units will be registered. The Provisional Unit will register with its UIC first two digits
of FH (FHXXXX). Provisional units formed from active units (FFXXXX) will use the third through fifth
character of the parent UIC, an H in the second, and a sixth character that best indicates the provisional
unit’s relationship to the parent. Examples: 41 FW (FFABC0) to 41 FW Provisional [just the headquarters
element] (FHABCA) or 66 AS (FFSSS0) to 66 AS Provisional [whole unit deployed] (FHSSS0). Provi-
sional units with a unique PAS code will be registered using the last four of that PAS for the second
through fifth characters of the UIC. When the unit is registered, the ORGLOCN sets must be entered in
addition to BIDE set.
A3.4. Command Reporting Organizations (RPTOR) Responsibilities.
All CROs prepare and submit BIDE reports (including RPTNORG and ORGLOCN sets) on all Active,
AF Reserve, and Air National Guard units, including DETs assigned a PAS code.


A3.5.1. Establishing Unit Identity. Identity is established in SORTS using the BIDE set. To initially reg-
ister a unit, report all mandatory fields in the BIDE, RPTNORG, and ORGLOCN sets (according to Table
A3.1., Table A3.2., and Table A3.3.) using the ADD transaction code.

      A8.6.1. (Added-ACC) Used for reporting problem AFSCs. The difference between the authorized
      and available critical personnel reported in the personnel measured area must equal the total differ-
      ence of all AFSC shortages listed in the remark. When reporting problem AFSCs, units must specify
      if they are critical personnel shortages or total personnel shortages. Data set should be: "Total or crit-
      ical personnel shortages read: AFSC/Auth or RQD/ASGN/AVAIL/UGT/PRC (personnel reason
      code)."
      A8.6.2. (Added-ACC) Available personnel cannot be more than authorized (for critical personnel
      only). Used for reporting civilian personnel included in overall figures. Data set should be: "Total or
      critical civilian personnel read, authorized/on-hand/available."
A8.7. (Added-ACC) TPAUTH Remarks. Used in reporting of foreign exchange officers for measured
units. Foreign exchange officers will not be used in calculations for personnel measured area and training
measured area. Data set should be: "Number of foreign exchange officers/nationality/duty position/MR
status" (report both total and critical).
A8.8. (Added-ACC) TCRAS Remarks. Used by ground TACS units (does not include ASOGs,
ASOSs, or ASOFs) to report crews assigned. Data set should be: "Crews assigned AFSC/UMD autho-
rized/UTC required/assigned/MR available."
A8.9. (Added-ACC) MEPSD/MEPSA/METAL Remarks. Used whenever major equipment assigned
differs from the combined total of major equipment possessed and major equipment TDY possessed,
explaining the variance.
      A8.9.1. (Added-ACC) Used to identify the number of backup aircraft inventory (BAI), tail number
      and location of aircraft in PDM, aircraft on loan to or from other units and an estimated return date.
      Data set should be: "Major equipment/tail number/location/status/ETIC."
      A8.9.2. (Added-ACC) Enter remarks on deployed major equipment under the MEPSD label.
A8.10. (Added-ACC) ERRES Remarks. Used to define the primary reason why equipment condition
measured area is less than R-1. Identify the driving factor(s) and report progressive get-well-dates. Used
by services units to report support equipment.
A8.11. (Added-ACC) ESRES Remarks. Used to define the primary reason why equipment and sup-
plies measured area is less than S-1. Identify the driving factor(s) and report progressive get-well-dates.
Used by medical units to report percentages of non-measured WRM projects.
A8.12. (Added-ACC) TRRES Remarks. Aviation units with an external fuel tank build-up (FTBU)
tasking will report teams in the TRRES remark section using the following data set: # personnel required
per UTC/# personnel fully trained/total # of teams formed.
A8.13. (Added-ACC) EQSSE Remarks. Used to report combat essential equipment shortfalls.
A8.14. (Added-ACC) CREWF/CREWA/CREAL Remarks:
      A8.14.1. (Added-ACC) Enter remarks on deployed crews under the CREWF label.
      A8.14.2. (Added-ACC) Used to amplify reported data for aircraft pilots/crews in the training mea-
      sured area. All flying units will report this remark.
      A8.14.3. (Added-ACC) Used when field differs from combined total of data fields and to explain the
      reason for variance. Use formula:
AFI10-201_ACC_I 21 SEPTEMBER 2006                                                                      441
