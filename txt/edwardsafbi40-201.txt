Terms
Abnormal Exposure—An exposure received in any monitoring period that, if continued at the
same rate, would exceed the limits specified in 10 CFR. Determine an abnormal exposure dose
equivalent by dividing the applicable (stochastic or nonstochastic) annual limit by the number of
monitoring periods during the year. For stochastic exposures, an abnormal exposure is 417
millirem (mrem) [4.2 milliSievert (mSv)] for any monthly monitoring period and 50 mrem (0.5
mSv) for any quarterly monitoring period.
ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) Program—A set of management and
administrative actions taken to make every reasonable effort to maintain personnel radiation
exposures as far below applicable doses limits as practicable consistent with the activity
undertaken.
ALARA Investigational Level—Locally established radiation exposure limits for personnel
dosimetry results that are less than the Air Force established criteria used to flag exposures that
are above normal, higher than expected, or could potentially result in an abnormal exposure if
trends continue. Informal investigation is conducted by permit RSO to determine the specifics of
the exposure, such as change in workload, tasks, or position. Results are reported to the
Installation Radiation Safety Officer and Radiation Safety Committee (if established).
Area TLD Monitor—Person assigned by the unit or section responsible for enforcing Operating
Instructions/Standards of the TLD program for that unit or area.
TLD—Thermoluminescent Dosimeter —The personnel dosimeter is used to indicate a close
approximation of the exposure dose to ionizing radiation to monitor exposures are maintained
ALARA. The badge contains a thermoluminescent dosimetry packet. The packet is exchanged
monthly or quarterly depending on the area where an individual works.
Pregnant Worker Action Level—Personnel dosimetry result which, if continued for the term of
pregnancy, would exceed the 500 mrem/9 month exposure limit for the fetus. This equates to
approximately 55 mrem on a monthly TLD.

  A. Exposures less than the ALARA Threshold Level: Except when deemed appropriate by
  the IRSO, no action is required.

  B. Exposures exceeding the ALARA Threshold Level: The IRSO will review the
  exposure of each individual whose exposure record exceeds the threshold level, conduct an
  investigation to determine the causes of the exposure, and make recommendations to
  preclude a recurrence. The IRSO will forward a letter stating the dose received and making
  recommendations for radiation protection to persons who exceed ALARA Level II dose
  limits.

  C. Investigational levels were determined by reviewing several years of TLD data.
  Edwards’ historical TLD results hover around the limit of detection.
