                                                          GENERAL

1.1. Purpose. Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2232, Maintenance Training, establishes training policy
and procedures for personnel assigned to aircraft, munitions, and missile maintenance organizations
throughout the Air Force.

1.2. Objective. Provide initial, upgrade, proficiency, qualification, recurring, and certification training
needed by a technician to perform duties in their primary Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC). The overall
capability of a maintenance unit depends on the state of training for personnel assigned. Training is essen-
tial to improving and sustaining unit capability and is one of the most important responsibilities of com-
manders and supervisors. When balancing resources, (e.g., aircraft, support equipment, facilities, tools,
funding, personnel, etc.) maintenance training carries an equal priority with the operational training mis-
sion.

1.3. Applicability. This instruction is directive in nature and applicable to commanders, supervisors,
Unit Training Managers (UTM), and personnel assigned to the Maintenance Group (MXG), maintenance
squadrons, MTF, and other maintenance organizations throughout the Air Force.
NOTE: Certain sections of this AFI are not applicable to Air National Guard (ANG)/Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC), Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM), and Nuclear units. Organizations that do
not have a Maintenance Training Flight (MTF) will complete skill level training in their individual work
centers. Performance-based activities (contractors and Most Efficient Organizations (MEO) shall
o rg a n i z e I AW A F I 3 8 - 2 0 3 , C o m m e rc i a l A c t iv i t i e s P ro g r a m , a n d s h a l l i m p l e m e n t t h e
organization required in accordance with their contract or management plan. Refer to MAJCOM instruc-
tions for further guidance, where applicable. Specific training requirements for Munitions, Nuclear and
Missile activities are included in the appropriate 21-2XX series instructions.

1.4. Equivalent Commanders. Throughout this instruction, responsibilities for the Maintenance Group
Commander (MXG/CC) are identified. For those units that do not align under an Maintenance Group
(MXG), their appropriate commander is equivalent.

1.5. Terminology. When using this instruction, the following applies:
    1.5.1. Must - Indicates a mandatory requirement.
    1.5.2. Will - Indicates a mandatory requirement.
    1.5.3. Should - Indicates a preferred or recommended method or option.
    1.5.4. May - Indicates an acceptable or satisfactory method or option.

1.6. Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). The MTF is the single point of contact for maintenance
training within the MXG In Accordance With (IAW) applicable AFI 36-2201 volumes and this publica-
tion.
NOTE: The UTM or civilian equivalent will serve as OPR for those units without an MTF.

1.7. AETC Training Detachment (TD) (Not applicable to ANG/AFRC units). TD is the primary air-
craft maintenance training agency on base. IAW AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, and
AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures, host wings will develop support agreements between sup-
pliers and receivers of resources to document recurring day-to-day peacetime support. The Host-Tenant
support agreement should address facilities, Operations and Maintenance (O&M) funding, administrative
support, Government Vehicle (GOV) allocations; aircraft support equipment to include sustainment costs,
and organizational/intermediate maintenance support of equipment beyond the TD capability.
    1.7.1. Air Education and Training Command (AETC) TD will be utilized as the primary maintenance
    training resource at all bases with an assigned TD. The TD will not be responsible to conduct ancillary
    training. The MTF will develop courses and supplement training when the training requirements are
    beyond the capability and timely response of the TD. The MTF will not duplicate training provided by
    the TD.

1.8. MAJCOM Mandatory Course List (MMCL) (Not applicable to ANG/AFRC, and ICBM). Lead
Commands will create a master list of all mandatory TD, MTF, and Advanced Distributed Learning
(ADL) courses for each mission design series aircraft. MAJCOMs will conduct annual audits by review-
ing monthly Status of Training reports to ensure all personnel identified to attend applicable MMCL
courses complete those courses. Personnel will begin required TD courses within 180 days of assignment
to the work center. ADL courses will be completed prior to taking the TD course they apply to or within
180 days of assignment to the work center, whichever comes first. If more than one TD course is required
or the individual needs to complete an MMCL prerequisite, then the individual must start each subsequent
course within 180 days of completion of the previous course or prerequisite.
1.8. (AMC) MAJCOM Mandatory Course List (MMCL) (Not applicable to ANG/AFRC, and ICBM).
The AMC/MAF MMCL is located at the AMC Aircraft Maintenance Training Enterprise site.
    1.8.1. MMCL courses are required for personnel in the following categories:
       1.8.1.1. Recent technical school graduates, either entry level or retrainees, who perform mainte-
       nance in a sortie producing or backshop AFSC.
       1.8.1.2. Personnel with no prior experience on assigned Mission Design Series (MDS) aircraft or
       who have not performed maintenance duty on the assigned MDS within the past 3 years.
NOTE: All master sergeants and above with less than 1 year experience on the assigned MDS, who
supervise maintenance personnel, will complete the appropriate TD or ADL familiarization courses.
    1.8.2. (Added-AMC) AMC/MAF ADL familiarization courses are Command Aircraft Systems
    Training (CAST).
    1.8.3. (Added-AMC) Personnel who are transitioning from one weapon system to another will attend
    the appropriate MMCL.
NOTE: En route personnel are only required to attend applicable MDS transition course.
    1.8.4. (Added-AMC) All waivers for MMCL courses must be approved by applicable AFSC MAJ-
    COM Functional Manager (FM). Requests for waivers will be initiated by the Maintenance Opera-
    tions Officer (MOO), coordinated through Unit Training Manager (UTM) for approval by SQ/CC and
    the MXG/CC and submit to the MAJCOM FM for approval. Waiver requests will contain individual’s
    name, rank, primary AFSC, duty position, course to be waived and a full justification.
AFI36-2232_AMCSUP_I 10 MARCH 2008                                                                      9


   1.8.5. (Added-AMC) When a waiver is approved, the unit training manager will file a copy of the
   letter and forward the original to the MOO. The UTM will update the IMDS using course status code
   "W”.

1.9. Utilization of Training Courses. Units will use AETC, TD, MTF and ancillary training courses for
upgrade, proficiency, qualification, recurring, and Cross Utilization Training (CUT).
   1.9.1. These courses will be used to the fullest extent possible.
   1.9.2. Report unused allocations during the Status of Training (SOT) briefing.

1.10. Class Cancellation Policy.
   1.10.1. TD classes with en-route, Temporary Duty (TDY), Air Reserve Component (ARC), or
   multi-phased students will not be canceled and will be supported by the host unit, unless approved by
   the wing commander.
   1.10.2. Host unit personnel will not be removed from TD courses due to appointments, local exer-
   cises, or higher headquarters inspections, unless approved by the wing commander.
   1.10.3. MXG/CC may cancel MTF classes during local exercises. The maintenance training operat-
   ing instruction, developed by the MTF, will outline the cancellation policies for MTF classes.
   1.10.4. Local students released from MTF/TD courses will report to their respective work centers.

1.11. Curriculum Advisory Committee (CAC) (Not applicable to ANG/AFRC, AFSOC and ICBM
units). Use the CAC to investigate, analyze, and recommend the most cost effective and efficient method
to satisfy training requests. The CAC will be composed of MTF’s Development Element (Chairperson),
UTM (as required), TD (as required), Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), applicable work center supervisors/
section chiefs, and MTF OIC/Chief (Optional).
1.11. (AMC) Curriculum Advisory Committee (CAC) (Not applicable to ANG/AFRC, AFSOC and
ICBM units). HQ AMC/A4MMT and using MTFs will be included in the CAC for all MQP level I-IV
courses.
   1.11.1. MTF Chief will conduct a CAC when:
       1.11.1.1. Developing a new course.
       1.11.1.2. Deciding which training agency should conduct requested training.
       1.11.1.3. Revising 25-percent or more of an existing course.
   1.11.2. The MTF can use a CAC to conduct reviews of MTF courses and TD courses when necessary.

1.12. Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) (Not applicable to ANG/AFRC, AFSOC and ICBM
units).
   1.12.1. The MTF and Base Education Services Officer (ESO), OPRs for ADL, will establish a mem-
   orandum of agreement (MOA) concerning administering ADL in maintenance organizations. The
   MOA may be part of a larger host/tenant wing or group support agreement.
       1.12.1.1. MOA will include as a minimum:
           1.12.1.1.1. Scope of training courses provided by the MTF.
10                                                         AFI36-2232_AMCSUP_I 10 MARCH 2008


            1.12.1.1.2. Facilitator support.
            1.12.1.1.3. Equipment and facility support.
            1.12.1.1.4. Distribution of course materials, schedules, and announcements.

1.13. Cross-Utilization Training (CUT). CUT training provides the unit internal flexibility by training
individuals to perform tasks that are not in their primary AFSC. This training can offset periods of austere
or low skill level manning. It also enhances combat capability by developing a pool of qualified personnel
to draw upon during surges. Use care not to create a dependency upon CUT trained personnel for every
task. CUT will never be a long-term fix or management solution for an AFSC shortfall. Ensure the train-
ing records of individual’s receiving CUT are appropriately documented. NOTE: This guidance does not
apply to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) (Predator/Global Hawk) weapon systems or other weapon sys-
tems where Air Force approved maintenance philosophy dictates the merger of AFSCs.
     1.13.1. (Added-AMC) Commanders and flightline supervisors must ensure personnel selected for
     CUT are performing satisfactorily in their assigned AFSC and meet CUT prerequisites to maintain a
     balanced work force.
     1.13.2. (Added-AMC) The target group for CUT is personnel trained to the 5-skill level or higher,
     and those who have completed level II or III of MQPs or FTD equivalent for their AFSC. Personnel
     must also have at least 12 months experience on their current MDS.
     1.13.3. (Added-AMC) The local MXG identifies required CUT tasks for each AFSC, ensuring tasks
     are trained via OJT. Supervisors will create applicable AF Form 797, Continuation of Training.

1.14. Block Training (Not applicable to ANG/AFRC and ICBM units). Block training is a term used in
the maintenance community to describe the type of format used for training. MTF uses this format to
group training requirements into a single training session. Maintenance initial and refresher training are
the most commonly conducted courses in the block-training format.

1.15. Ancillary Training. Accomplish according to governing directives. Make every effort to consoli-
date training requirements to reduce the impact on the mission.

1.16. Training Overdues. Individual recurring qualifications become overdue on the last day of the
month in which recertification is due. When an individual is TDY, on leave, or incapacitated, that person
need not be decertified provided the required training/evaluations are completed within 30 days of the
member’s return to duty, not to exceed 2 calendar months from original due date, unless specified by
another authoritative reference.
     1.16.1. Count personnel who go overdue for training (including those TDY, on leave and scheduled)
     as overdue on the SOT until trained.

1.17. Air Force Engineering and Technical Services (AFETS) Management and Control.
     1.17.1. When necessary, use AFETS personnel for specialized systems/equipment training and inte-
     grate them within the MTF instructional effort.
     1.17.2. Courses developed or taught by AFETS will be coordinated through the MTF to ensure
     courses meet curriculum standards.
AFI36-2232_AMCSUP_I 10 MARCH 2008                                                                      11

       1.20.5.11. TD Utilization Rate. This rate reflects how well the unit utilized the seats that were
       allocated from the TD, compute it by dividing the number of seats utilized, by the number of seats
       requested (for the reported month) and expressed as a percentage.
       1.20.5.12. MTF Demand Response Rate. Divide the number of quotas requested for MTF con-
       ducted courses by the number allocated and reflect the rate as a percentage. The percentage will
       not be above 100%.
       1.20.5.13. MTF Utilization Rate. This rate reflects how well the unit utilized the seats that were
       allocated from MTF, compute it by dividing the number of seats utilized, by the number of seat
       requested (for the reported month) and expressed as a percentage.
NOTE: MTFs should report lost training time IAW their MAJCOM instruction. Paragraph not applicable
to ANG and AFRC units.
       1.20.5.14. Training Effectiveness. Compute training effectiveness by dividing the number of orig-
       inally scheduled personnel plus walk-ins, minus deviations, by the total number of quotas finally
       allocated. (Example: 100 originally scheduled + 5 walk-ins - 10 deviations, divided by 105 total
       quota allocations = 90% training effectiveness rate).

1.21. Aircraft/Munitions Maintenance Special Experience Identifier (SEI) Policy (Not applicable to
ANG/AFRC, ICBM and Nuclear units). Special experience identifiers are designed to identify personnel
with special experience and rapidly identify maintenance resources to meet management objectives. The
purpose of this policy is to improve the identification of experienced personnel, deployment/assignment
equity, and maintenance capability. The objectives of this policy are to:
     1.21.1. Measure unit and MAJCOM experience levels, and support appropriate management action
     to increase experience levels where needed.
     1.21.2. Ensure maintenance personnel who have relevant hands-on experience on aircraft, engines,
     and associated equipment/LRUs are awarded all appropriate SEIs.
AFI36-2232_AMCSUP_I 10 MARCH 2008                                                                   15


  1.21.3. Ensure all maintenance personnel are rotated to SEI-coded duty positions where relevant
  hands-on experience can be acquired within 36 months of date arrived station.
  1.21.4. Utilization and Training Workshops (U&TW). Aircraft/Munitions maintenance career field
  managers and MAJCOM functional managers will review SEIs in Air Force Manual (AFMAN)
  36-2108, Enlisted Classification, for accuracy during U&TWs on maintenance AFSCs. Responsibili-
  ties:
     1.21.4.1. HQ USAF/ILMM/W are the OPRs for the Air Force.
     1.21.4.2. The maintenance staff functional manager is the OPR at MAJCOM level. MAJCOM
     functional managers will:
         1.21.4.2.1. Monitor the status of experience levels at each base/unit via analysis of the num-
         bers of personnel possessing SEIs versus the total number of personnel assigned within the
         AFSC/program element code (PEC).
         1.21.4.2.2. Identify, by name, those individuals assigned to a base/unit with more than 36
         months Time On Station (TOS) and not awarded an SEI applicable to that base/unit. Provide
         this list to the MXG/CC/maintenance supervisor, superintendent for analysis/investigation.
         1.21.4.2.3. Ensure positions are coded at MAJCOM or base level. Monitor the coding of posi-
         tions. A recommended measurement is the total number of Unit Manning Document (UMD)
         positions vs. the number of SEI coded positions in a given AFSC.
         1.21.4.2.4. Reporting procedures: MAJCOMs will provide a semi-annual report to HQ
         USAF/ILMM on 1 April and 1 October, summarizing the MAJCOM experience levels in each
         of the target AFSCs IAW specified reporting criteria. Reports will portray:
            1.21.4.2.4.1. The total number of personnel by Controlled Air Force Specialty Code
            (CAFSC) who have been assigned to a SEI coded or uncoded position with TOS of 18-24,
            25-36, and more than 36 months who do not have a unit relevant SEI awarded to any
            AFSC, will be reported IAW the format contained at the HQ USAF/ILMM aircraft main-
            tenance website:
            HTTPS://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-LG-AF-35
            In addition, provide specific reasons/logic for each individual without being awarded SEI
            and greater than 36 months TOS.

         1.21.4.3.1. Monitor the group experience levels as indicated by the number of assigned per-
         sonnel with SEIs awarded versus the total number of personnel assigned within the AFSC/
         PEC.
         1.21.4.3.2. Implement actions to ensure individuals with more than 24 months TOS without
         award of SEI complete all requirements before the 36 months TOS to preclude having to
         report those individuals to Air Staff.
         1.21.4.3.3. Provide the reason why any assigned personnel with more than 36 months TOS
         has not been awarded a SEI resulting from assignment to a coded position, to the MAJCOM
         OPR. Provide the proposed date each of these individuals is anticipated to be awarded the
         applicable SEI.

        1.21.4.4. The Maintenance Operations Officer (MOO)/Superintendent is the unit focal point for
        SEI management. Unit commanders/MOO/Superintendent will:
           1.21.4.4.1. Assign personnel to authorized positions consistent with requirements, individuals
           grade, and skill level.
           1.21.4.4.2. Ensure previously awarded SEIs are re-designated to newly awarded AFSCs dur-
           ing personnel upgrade actions.
           1.21.4.4.3. Ensure individuals are awarded the assigned weapons systems SEI to an awarded
           AFSC when SEI awarding criteria contained in AFMAN 36-2108 has been met.
           1.21.4.4.4. For multiple MDS units, initiate action to award additional relevant SEIs if/when
           an individual gains experience on additional MDSs. Award additional SEIs using AF Form
           2096, Classification/On-The-Job Training Action, or P-series orders.
           1.21.4.4.5. Ensure that those personnel with 18-24 months TOS, without an SEI applicable to
           the unit of assignment, and assigned to positions not coded with an airframe, engine, or
           sub-system SEI are rotated into positions where an applicable SEI may be earned and
           awarded.
     1.21.5. Code UMD positions in the following manner:
        1.21.5.1. Do not code Maintenance Operations Center (MOC), tool room, safety, vehicle NCOs,
        quality, or other staff/support functions with weapon system or engine SEIs.
        1.21.5.2. MAJCOMs must ensure that only those positions where relevant hands-on experience
        can be gained are coded with the weapons system/engine-specific SEI based upon the following
        guidelines.
        1.21.5.3. Code positions with the weapons system SEI: 2A0X1A/B, 2A3X1X, 2A3X2, 2A3X3X,
        2A5X1X, 2A5X2X, 2A5X3, 2A6X3, 2A6X4, 2A6X5, 2A6X6, and 2W1X1 (including armament
        backshops).
        1.21.5.4. Code positions with weapons systems/avionics systems as determined by the lead com-
        mand for Mobility Air Force (MAF)/Combat Air Force (CAF), or HQ AFSOC: 2A0X1C/D.
        1.21.5.5. Code positions with engine SEI where personnel can receive hands-on engine experi-
        ence (flightline, Jet Engine Intermediate Maintenance (JEIM), and test cell): 2A6X1A/B.
        1.21.5.6. Code positions with either weapons system or low observable SEI: 2A7X3.
        1.21.5.7. Electro-environmental (2A6X6) and hydraulics (2A6X5) back shop positions will be
        coded with weapon system SEI where personnel can receive hands-on experience (flightline, can-
        nibalization and phase/isochronal inspection docks).
        1.21.5.8. Aerospace Repair (A/R) shops will be coded with the A/R SEI.
        1.21.5.9. For units having positions on their UMD funded by another MAJCOM under a host/ten-
        ant or memorandum of agreement, the positions will be coded with the coordination/ approval of
        the funding MAJCOM.
        1.21.5.10. MAJCOMs may code additional positions with appropriate SEIs with the concurrence
        of the MAJCOM functional manager.
AFI36-2232_AMCSUP_I 10 MARCH 2008                                                                       17


   1.21.6. Triggers. The trigger point is the point where MAJCOMs must review unit experience/man-
   ning levels for further action. MAJCOMs may develop their own trigger point, with justification,
   based on the total number of personnel assigned in the AFSC vs. the number of personnel holding a
   wing applicable awarded SEI. As a minimum, the experience baseline will be 60%. If experience lev-
   els in a specific AFSC fall below this point, MAJCOMs should consider steps to help alleviate the sit-
   uation. These may include Temporary Duty (TDY), manning assistance, assignment availability
   codes, using SEIs in the overseas selection/returnee allocations cycle, when available, to direct people
   with the required SEI into a particular location, or command leveling using skill level, SEI, and time
   on station as the assignment selection criteria. Any request for assistance to AFPC will be accompa-
   nied by justification to include total personnel assigned in the AFSC, number of personnel in the wing
   holding an awarded, relevant SEI and the number of personnel with greater than 36 months time on
   station without an award of an SEI. Units with personnel on station longer than 36 months with no SEI
   awarded will have difficulty justifying their need for assistance.
NOTE: This trigger point does not affect or prevent SEI selection rates approved by MAJCOMs or
AFPC through normal channels.

1.22. The Maintenance Training Advisory Group (MATAG):
   1.22.1. Purpose. HQ USAF convenes the MATAG periodically to provide a cohesive approach to
   improving readiness through better maintenance training. The MATAG reviews current maintenance
   training problems and successes, coordinates maintenance training initiatives, and advises the Air
   Force ILM on overall maintenance training programs. In addition, the MATAG:
       1.22.1.1. Sets maintenance training goals and priorities.
       1.22.1.2. Reviews training programs impacting maintenance, including ancillary training, and
       recommends changes to program OPRs.
       1.22.1.3. Evaluates emerging training technologies.
   1.22.2. Membership. Voting members of the MATAG include HQ USAF/ILMM, HQ USAF/ILMW,
   and each MAJCOM, Forward Operational Area ( FOA), and Direct Reporting Unit (DRU) with main-
   tenance training responsibilities. Other interested people may attend but may not vote. AFLMA, and
   AETC/DOOM will be an advisor to the MATAG.

1.23. Training Continuity Books (Not applicable to ANG/AFRC and ICBM units). Develop and main-
tain a training continuity book for every duty position in the MTF. Each book depicts procedures for
accomplishing tasks associated with each duty position. Write continuity books to a standard that permits
a newly appointed person to comply with existing policy and procedures with minimal assistance.
NOTE: Combine the MTF Chief duty position and Training Management Section Chief duty position
tasks into one book.

1.24. Unit Training Assessments (UTA) (Not applicable to ANG/AFRC/ICBM units). The MTF is
responsible to ensure every maintenance unit conducts a UTA every 18 months. These assessments will
be conducted to make sure personnel are kept updated with changes in new core tasks or local supervisor
supplemental task requirements added to the CFETP. The UTM serves as OPR for their respective unit
and will conduct this review with assistance from work center supervisors.

     1.24.1. As a minimum, UTM will review the Master Training Plan (MTP) and Master Task List
     (MTL), for the following:
        1.24.1.1. Ensure most-current CFETP or change notice is posted.
        1.24.1.2. Ensure any new core task or local supervisor supplemental task requirements are identi-
        fied.
     1.24.2. Workcenter supervisors will review individual training records in conjunction with the UTA
     to ensure they reflect the most current CFETP or change notice.
     1.24.3. The UTA may be combined with the 18-month unit Staff Assistance Visit (SAV) required in
     AFI 36-2201, volume 3, Units using MIS Training Business Area (TBA) to document training do not
     have to comply with this requirement.

1.25. Training Assessment Feedback (Not applicable to ANG/AFRC and ICBM units). The MTF Chief
serves as OPR for local administration for internal and Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR) for
external feedback:
     1.25.1. Establish a feedback loop, in the maintenance training operating instruction, between the
     Quality Assurance Program (QAP) and the MTF that focuses on training deficiencies.
     1.25.2. Ensure training feedback (internal and external) surveys are returned.
     1.25.3. Report external survey (Graduate Assessment Surveys, Field Evaluation Questionnaires,
     Occupational Surveys, etc.) results in the SOT report/briefing.

                         MAINTENANCE TRAINING DOCUMENTATION

3.1. Introduction. The purpose of this chapter is to provide training documentation and evaluation
instructions that are unique to maintenance career fields.

3.2. Training Documents.
     3.2.1. Use automated training documentation forms, CFETPs, JQS, and (QTP) in CAMS, IMDS or
     Air Force approved MIS when available.
     3.2.2. Use AF Form 2426, Training Request and Completion Notification, or approved electronic
     form, to request training or record training completions. The electronic form must be mutually agreed
     upon by host wing MTF and TD.
        3.2.2.1. The group commander is the final approval authority for all versions of the AF Form
        2426.
     3.2.3. Use AF Form 898 (not applicable to ANG/ARFC units), or approved electronic form, to man-
     age, forecast, and request unit TD training requirements. Use this form to identify, prioritize, and
     request wing TD course requirements. MTFs and TDs supporting AETC units will use the AF Form
     898 or electronic form for scheduling TD systems and associate courses. The electronic form must be
     mutually agreed upon by host wing MTF and TD. Units who use an electronic product must ensure all
     areas identified on the AF Form 898 are included.
        3.2.3.1. This document, once approved, is a contract between the host wing and the AETC TD.
        3.2.3.2. The group commander is the final approval authority for all versions of the AF Form 898.
        3.2.3.3. Upgrade Training Waivers. See comprehensive guidance for training waivers in AFMAN
        36-2108 and AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel.
        3.2.3.4. Maintenance Training Flight coordinates training course control documents (CCD) deal-
        ing with explosive safety annually through the wing weapons safety office.
NOTE: The MXG/CC may delegate to the MTF Commander/Chief.

3.3. Training Records. As a minimum, training records will be kept on all personnel in military rank of
TSgt and below as well as any other personnel in upgrade training or retraining. Additionally, documen-
tation will be kept on all MSgts and above who perform maintenance on aircraft, missiles and associated
equipment regardless of rank. Consideration should be given to tasks these people might be called upon to
perform while deployed.
     3.3.1. MSgts and above need only be certified on the "hands on" tasks they may normally be expected
     to perform. This does not have to include career field core tasks or local upgrade requirements unless
     they will be doing these tasks. An AF Form 623 (Air Force Training Record), Air Force Form 623a
     and CFETP will be used to provide a record of qualification. ARC may use CFEPT or MIS system to
     document training for MSgt and above.
AFI36-2232_AMCSUP_I 10 MARCH 2008                                                                              25


    3.3.2. There is no special requirement for development of a training record for individuals performing
    task certification only. ICBM maintenance organizations will follow training management require-
    ments in AFI 21-2XX.

3.4. Core tasks. Core tasks, as identified in the specialty training standard (STS) portion of the CFETP,
designate minimum on-the-job (OJT) training requirements for skill-level upgrade in an AFSC. MAJ-
COM Functional Managers, commanders, and supervisors may designate additional critical tasks as
required for upgrade training. When designated, certify these critical tasks using normal core task certifi-
cation procedures. As a minimum, certification on all AFCFM-directed core tasks applicable to the spe-
cialty must be completed for skill level upgrade. Exemptions:
    3.4.1. Core tasks, which are not applicable to base assigned aircraft, missiles or equipment, are not
    required for upgrade (units are not required to send personnel TDY for core task training).
    3.4.2. For units with more than one mission design (e.g., A-10) aircraft or missile system, upgrade
    trainees need only complete core tasks on a single MDS. MFMs, unit commanders, and or supervisors
    may require trainees to complete core task training on additional mission design aircraft or missile
    system, if desired. If some of these core tasks involve training in another unit on base, trainees must
    still complete all core tasks relevant to at least one mission design aircraft or missile system. These
    additional tasks will not be upgrade training requirements for the individual. All units are bound by
    the requirements in this instruction and will accommodate core task trainees from other units.

3.5. Third-Party Certification of Core Tasks. The latest revision to AFI 36-2201 significantly changed
policy requiring third-party certification of CFETP core tasks. The new policy gives the AFCFM the
authority to designate those core tasks that require third-party certification. AF/ILM does not require
third-party certifications of core tasks in maintenance CFETPs (2AXXX, 2MXXX, 2PXXX, 2RXXX,
2WXXX). Maintenance tasks that are mission-critical or have a definite potential for personnel injury or
damage can be documented on the Special Certification Roster (SCR) IAW AFI 21-101. Keep in mind,
personnel will still have to be trained on all core tasks IAW with the specific CFETP prior to skill-level
upgrade. In this case, the trainer will fulfill the role of both trainer and certifier, and the trainee will still
have to demonstrate task proficiency to the go level before being signed off.
    3.5.1. MAJCOMs, commanders, and workcenter supervisors still retain the option to designate criti-
    cal tasks (core or non-core), not already tracked on the SCR, that require third-party certification. The
    goal is to delegate this authority to the lowest level. To designate a task as requiring third-party certi-
    fication, circle the appropriate asterisk in the core task column on the STS portion of the CFETP in the
    master task list (MTL) and individual training records. If the task is not already designated as a core
    task, place just the circle at the appropriate location in the core task column.

                                                Chapter 4

                         MAINTENANCE INFORMATION SYSTEMS (MIS)
                              TRAINING BUSINESS AREA (TBA)

4.1. Introduction. Maintenance training is one of many CAMS and CAMS-For Mobility (G081) legacy
applications that are being transformed into one of the Air Force approved MIS business areas. The pro-
posed MIS design calls for six to seven new business areas to support wing level maintenance processes.
The TBA satisfies one of these processes. MIS will enhance training management production by automat-
ing information contained in AF Form 623 (paper-based) record and legacy applications. This will
increase readiness, and improve sustainability of Air Force weapon systems and equipment. Systems cur-
rently approved for use in training management are CAMS and G081. These systems are designed to
facilitate training management for personnel in maintenance-related career fields. MIS use is mandatory
when available. The MTF and or UTM are the Point of contact (POC) for functional administration of the
MIS training component.

4.2. Purpose. The MIS TBA provides authorized users with ready access to training related information
currently maintained in many different places and not readily accessible to those who need the informa-
tion. TBA will allow users to:
     4.2.1. Maintain configuration management of AFJQS, CFETP, and STS tasks.
     4.2.2. Maintain configuration management of ancillary and special training courses.
     4.2.3. Maintain workcenter MTLs and MTPs.
     4.2.4. Maintain individual training records (AF Form 623).
     4.2.5. Manage and track individual CDC enrollments.
     4.2.6. Manage and track individual training courses and tasks.
     4.2.7. Schedule and manage classes and events.
     4.2.8. Forecast training shortfalls.
     4.2.9. Predict Unit Type Code (UTC) training qualifications and shortfalls.

4.3. Administration. At wing level, the MTF and or UTM are the POC for functional administration of
the MIS TBA. Users will submit trouble reports to UTM or MTF. The UTM will evaluate each trouble
report to determine if the problem is software-related or related to lack of user knowledge/training. If the
UTM cannot resolve the trouble report locally, he/she will forward it to MTF for resolution. If the MTF
cannot resolve the trouble report, MTF will forward the trouble/change request to either the COI, CFA, or
to the MIS FCB as applicable. Forward all training reports related to data/records in the system to the
CFA. Additionally, maintenance UTMs will conduct the AF Training Course using the MIS TBA (when
available).

4.4. User Roles. User roles will be assigned based on their position in the maintenance training contin-
uum. At wing level, the MXG/CC will appoint a set number of individuals who will have authority to
assign user level access/permissions in MIS TBA. The MXG/CC may delegate this authority to the MTF
Flight Commander/Chief. At the MAJCOM and numbered Air Force level, the MAJCOM maintenance
AFI36-2232_AMCSUP_I 10 MARCH 2008                                                                          27


training manager is the approval authority for setting roles and permissions. The AFCFM is the approval
authority for setting roles and permissions at any other level. Table 4.1. identifies the roles established in
MIS TBA:

4.5. Community of Interest (COI). The COI provides a process through which system users bring new
requirements for validation and prioritization. All requested changes must be approved by this body prior
to submission to the MIS FCB. COI membership includes the AFCFM (chair), MAJCOM maintenance
training managers, HQ AETC/DOOM, AFCA/EVP, and HQ DFSG & OSSG/LR (advisory role only).
The COI will evaluate change requests annually in conjunction with the MATAG. All change requests
must be submitted to the MAJCOM maintenance training managers for consideration by the COI. The
CFA will consolidate all MAJCOM change requests for presentation at the MIS FCB. The AFCFM may
recommend out-of-cycle requests, on a case-by-case basis, when subject requests are of a mission-critical
nature.

4.6. Maintenance Information Systems (MIS) Functional Capabilities Board (FCB). The MIS FCB
provides a Portfolio Management (PfM) process through which COI, MIS users, legacy system Func-
tional Review Boards, and respective MAJCOMs bring new MIS requirements for validation, scoring,
and prioritization (only if a COI has not previously accomplished validation and prioritization). The MIS
FCB is composed of voting representatives from each MAJCOM and is chaired by the PfM Manager (Air
Staff, HQ USAF/ILMM). When requirements have been validated, scored, and prioritized by the MIS
FCB, they are sent to the affected MIS Program Office, which in turn performs analysis and scope for
each and processes them for MIS Configuration Control Board projection for inclusion into the MIS
enterprise solution.

4.7. Maintenance Information System (MIS) Configuration Control Board (CCB). All requested
changes to the MIS must be approved by the FCB prior to submission to the MIS CCB. CCB membership
includes the MIS Program Manager (HQ DFSG & OSSG/LR chair), AFCFM, MAJCOM maintenance
training managers, HQ AETC/DOOM, and AFCA/EVP. The CCB will evaluate change requests annually
in conjunction with the MATAG. The CFA will consolidate all MAJCOM change requests for presenta-
tion at the CCB. The MIS Program Manager can approve out-of-cycle requests, on a case-by-case basis,
when subject requests are of a mission-critical nature.
     4.7.1. Automated AF Form 623s are approved for use in maintenance training management through
     AF-approved MIS only. See applicable user manuals for specific details.

tems. This web page also contains supporting documents for: MCT Implementation Plan, MCT Prefix
Guide, and an Excel Export of the MCT for users who have connectivity issues. Additionally, specific
lists and usage instructions can be found in the applicable MIS and MIS user manuals. NOTE: This web
page is subject to change without notice.
     4.8.1. Master Course Code CCB. All requested changes to the IMDS Centralized Database (CDB)
     MCT must be approved by the configuration control board (CCB) prior to submission to the MCT
     Manager. CCB membership includes HQ IL/ILMM chair, appointed MAJCOM representatives, and
     HQ OSSG/LRM (advisory/current MCT Manager). The MCT Manager will consolidate all MAJ-
     COM non-critical change requests for presentation to the CCB. The CCB will evaluate/approve/disap-
     prove non-critical change requests annually in conjunction with applicable U&TW and MATAG.
     4.8.2. Master Course Code Approval Process: Course additions, changes, and deletions identified as
     non-critical but time sensitive/critical: All aircraft related course code changes should go thru the Air-
     craft Lead command for concurrence on how that requirement is to be tracked Air Force wide. Prefor-
     matted request letters must be completed for each new request and forwarded to the MAJCOM
     representative for approval and submission to the MCT Manager. Immediate change requests of a crit-
     ical nature may be routed for e-mail approval from the requesting MAJCOM POC, thru all other
     MAJCOM POCs to HQ AF/ILMM for immediate approval and processing. If approved, these
     requests will be sent to the AF MCT Manager for processing/implementation.
     4.8.3. Master Course Code Waiver Process: AF/ILMM is the waiver authority for all local course
     codes to be used for local requirements tracking only. Local Requirements Tracking: Will be those
     requirements that only the submitting Unit/Base has a valid training requirement that must, by direc-
     tive, be tracked in an MIS. This valid training requirement must not be applicable to any other Unit/
     Base/MAJCOM in order to be exclusively tracked locally. If it does apply to any other Unit/Base/
     MAJCOM then the requirement, if valid, must be submitted as an MCT request for all users to have
     access to. Requests for waivers must be submitted through your MAJCOM representative to AF/
     ILMM with full justification as to why the Unit/Base requires more local course codes than the preset
     limit of 20 per base established by HQ AF/ILMM. If disapproved, AF/ILMM will return submission
     with justification for disapproval.

4.10. (Added-AMC) G081 Training Subsystem. The G081 Master Course Table (MCT) is a manage-
ment tool, NOT a training record. MIS/MCT course codes are for scheduling, tracking and administering
maintenance training. The MCT is for documenting recurring training, special certifications and inspec-
tions, MAJCOM directed high interest tasks, and frequently scheduled training. Course codes not utilized
within 6-months of establishment will be deleted from the MCT. Initial training will not be loaded as an
MCT course code if there is a recurring training requirement unless specifically directed by instructions/
standards.
 (Added) NOTE: Course codes for formal technical training courses (excluding FTD courses), AF Form
623 training record, one time tasks, PME courses and AFIT courses will not be documented in MIS/MCT
when documented through other means such as MILPDS.
   4.10.1. (Added-AMC) Each Group (e.g. MXG, MSG, SC) is allowed 20 local course codes. These
   codes are for specific requirements or tracking needs and local group-directed high interest tasks and
   will be approved by the MTF (or equivalent) chief. All exceptions will be submitted to MAJCOM for
   review and approval. Submit (mail, fax, or e-mail) requests for course additions, changes, merges, or
   deletions through the MTF to HQ AMC/A4MMT at AMCA4MMT.G081@scott.af.mil.
   4.10.2. (Added-AMC) AFRC units forward requests through applicable Numbered Air Force (NAF)
   to HQ AMC/A4MMT. AFRC and ANG functional managers have approval authority for the AFRC
   and ANG Prefix Codes. HQ AMC/A4MMT is approval authority for all other codes. HQ AMC/

     A4MMT will conduct a course code validation review biennially to maintain course listing accuracy
     and continued utilization.
     4.10.3. (Added-AMC) The MIS produces three basic listings that detail an organization’s collective
     personnel qualifications and training requirements. They are the training forecast, Special Certifica-
     tion Roster (SCR), and the work center training requirements. Training activities and maintenance
     supervisors at all levels use these lists to manage the maintenance training program. The MTF/unit
     training office will establish procedures to ensure completed training, qualifications, and inspector
     authorizations are verified by source documents prior to input to the MIS. Local O.I.s will determine
     production and distribution of these products.
        4.10.3.1. (Added-AMC) The training forecast is capable of listing the appropriate status of all
        training courses, qualifications, and inspector authorizations loaded in the MIS for each individ-
        ual.
        4.10.3.2. (Added-AMC) The SCR records special certifications/authorizations. The roster or
        on-line MIS capability will be made accessible to all applicable supervisors. Special certification
        tasks are maintained in the MIS as certification (CERT) and inspection (INSP) courses. The SCR
        is reviewed by the appropriate supervisor to verify entries are accurate and that prerequisites,
        including applicable training, testing, evaluation, or other requirements for task certification were
        completed. AFI 21-101, Maintenance Management of Aircraft, is the controlling directive for the
        SCR program.
        4.10.3.3. (Added-AMC) Work center training requirements contains recurring training require-
        ments for the majority of personnel assigned to the work center.
4.11. (Added-AMC) Automated Scheduling. The MTF will determine, in conjunction with unit training
activities, those training events and requirements to be scheduled through the MIS.

                          MAINTENANCE TRAINING FLIGHT (MTF)

5.1. General. The MTF is an MXG-level agency organized as a centralized aircraft maintenance training
function (Figure 5.1). However, UTMs should be physically located and conduct their daily duties in the
unit(s) they support. All Maintenance Instructors (MI) and UTMs (AFSC 3S2X1) will be assigned to the
MTF under the Maintenance Operation Squadron (MOS) for administrative purposes. The centralization
concept provides economy of scale and standardizes maintenance training throughout the MAJCOM.
UTMs will manage one or more squadrons (if necessary). The MTF consists of the Training Management
Section and Development & Instructor (D&I) Section. These sections are subdivided into elements.
NOTE: Organizations that do not have a Maintenance Training Flight (MTF) will complete skill training
in the individual work centers (or Equivalent Training Function). Performance-based activities (contrac-
tors and MEOs) shall organize IAW AFI 38-203, and shall implement the organization required in accor-
dance with their contract or management plan. Chapter is not applicable to ANG/AFRC units. ICBM units
will organize MTF IAW with appropriate AFI 21-2XX instructions.
   5.1.1. The MTF is responsible for the functional management, utilization, control, and training of
   assigned 3S2X1 personnel. This structure provides the best possible environment to ensure the MTF
   can fulfill their responsibilities, support all MXG customer needs, and effectively manage, utilize,
   train and mentor assigned 3S2X1 personnel to be productive and progress within their career field.
   The overall responsibility for management of the MTF rests with the Flight Commander/Chief.
   5.1.2. Coordinate with Programs, Scheduling & Documentation (PS&D) function and the production
   supervisor or MOO/SUPT for selecting training aircraft. The MTF shall forward training requirements
   in a monthly format (including configuration and time periods) to Maintenance Operation Flight
   (MOF) PS&D by the end of the second week of each month for inclusion in the monthly maintenance
   schedule. Training requirements must be updated weekly and forwarded to MOF and Aircraft Mainte-
   nace Unit (AMU) PS&D for inclusion in the weekly maintenance plan. The MTF is responsible for
   scheduled maintenance training aircraft (in conjunction with the AMU) to include maintaining aircraft
   forms and coordinating on- and off-equipment maintenance.
NOTE: UTMs assigned to support an AMXS should be located in the squadron, instead of AMU to
ensure consistency across all AMUs.

5.2. Manning.
   5.2.1. Supervision. The Flight Chief position should be an authorized AFSC 3S2X1.
   5.2.2. Training Management Section. The Training Management Section Chief will be an authorized
   AFSC 3S2X1. The Non Commissioned Officer In Charge (NCOIC) of Scheduling and Training Man-
   ager Elements will be authorized AFSC 3S2X1s.
   5.2.3. Development and Instructor Section. The Development and Instructor Section Chief should be
   the ranking individual assigned to the section. The Development Element NCOIC will be an individ-
   ual holding an authorized AFSC 3S2X1, while the Instructor Element NCOIC should be the highest
   ranking assigned instructor.

5.3. Training. The MTF Chief will ensure squadron personnel (instructors and UTMs) are adequately
trained to perform their duties. Periodically (recommended at 2 year point) rotate UTMs (3S2X1) to dif-
ferent duty positions or sections to gain experience. All individuals should attend applicable formal
schools, and receive training in current and new technologies by other commands, services, and civilian
institutions. MTFs must ensure adequate funding is programmed and budgeted to meet TDY and training
needs, and conduct in-house training for assigned personnel on a regular basis.

                                         EN-ROUTE TRAINING

7.1. General. The En-Route training program provides individuals with mission essential training
needed to meet the requirements of an assignment to short or long tour locations. En-Route training for
long tour location is only authorized if specific courses are not available at that location (short tour loca-
tions will receive priority status over long tour assignments).
NOTE: IAW AFI 36-2110, en-route training is not authorized during intra-theater assignments. This
chapter does not apply to ANG/AFRC and ICBM Units.

7.2. Establishing New En-Route Training Requirements. Each year units must submit through the
annual screening process an AF Form 3933, MAJCOM Mission Training Request, through the MTF, to the
parent MAJCOM to meet future en-route requirements, IAW AF/DPP Mission Readiness Training (MRT)
guidance in AFI 36-2201.

7.3. Establishing Sequential En-Route Requirements. Each year, units submit requirements during
the AF/DPP MRT annual (data call) process. Submit requirements through the local MTF to the MAJ-
COM Training Branch.

7.4. Factors to Consider When Scheduling En-Route Training. The Assignment Gains Roster (or an
automated product used to identify inbound personnel) is available from your local Military Personnel
Flight (MPF) or your unit.
   7.4.1. Initiate training requests at the beginning of the assignment cycle. Training requests initiated
   within 90 days of Military Personnel Flight (RNLTD) are considered late.
   7.4.2. Supervisors will use the following factors as a minimum in determining a person’s qualifica-
   tions:
       7.4.2.1. Training history (listed by three-digit, Personnel Data System (PDS)) code. (Translations
       for PDS codes are listed in Education and Training Course Announcements web page).
       7.4.2.2. Member’s duty history.
       7.4.2.3. SEI.

7.5. Canceling En-Route Training Request. When it is determined that an En-Route training require-
ment no longer exists, the MTF will notify the command functional training manager and cancel the
requirement.
   7.5.1. (Added-AMC) En route Training for AMC En routes. En route training provides weapon sys-
   tem training to aircraft maintenance personnel assigned to AMC En route units. Training may be pro-
   vided en route during permanent change of station (PCS), or via FTD, MQP/RTC, or flight line
   training. It may include temporary duty (TDY) to school.
   7.5.2. (Added-AMC) Training Provided En route During PCS. En route training requirements will
   be scheduled based on the gaining organization's need. The gaining organization will identify to HQ
   AMC/A4MMT what training is required for the individual. HQ AMC/A4MMT will schedule appro-
   priate course (FTD, MQTP, or flight line training based on availability of classes within the desired
54                                                          AFI36-2232_AMCSUP_I 10 MARCH 2008


     PCS time frame). Unusual circumstances may prevent training and in these cases, HQ AMC/A4MMT
     will notify the unit.
        7.5.2.1. (Added-AMC) En route training directed by HQ AMC/A4MMT has priority over local
        training. Individuals qualified on one or more AMC weapon system may be scheduled to attend
        training on an additional AMC weapon system.
     7.5.3. (Added-AMC) AMC losing unit responsibilities:
        7.5.3.1. (Added-AMC) To ensure proficiency, units will ensure personnel PCSing to AMC over-
        seas En route units will have at least 60 days of on-aircraft experience immediately prior to depart-
        ing.
        7.5.3.2. (Added-AMC) TSgt and below in AFSCs 2A5X1, 2A5X3A, 2A5X3B, 2A6X1X,
        2A6X5 and 2A6X6 not directly performing sortie generation maintenance will be placed back in
        the flightline environment as soon as possible upon notification of the assignment.
        7.5.3.3. (Added-AMC) Flightline refresher and refamiliarization training will concentrate on
        CFETP core tasks and other training requirements identified by the gaining unit.
        7.5.3.4. (Added-AMC) Short notice assignment notification will sometimes not allow for 60
        days of flightline training; in these cases training will concentrate on CFETP core tasks.
        7.5.3.5. (Added-AMC) To facilitate processing of the training request, MTFs must provide the
        correct course numbers and fund cite for MQTP/Air Mobility Warfare Center courses. Contact the
        members for current duty position/qualifications/ Special Experience Identifiers (SEIs). For over-
        seas to overseas personnel (not intratheater), check course length and time between Date Eligible
        to Return from Overseas (DEROS) and Report Not Later Than Date (RNLTD).
     7.5.4. (Added-AMC) AMC Gaining Unit Responsibilities:
        7.5.4.1. (Added-AMC) Gaining En route units will contact losing unit to determine what training
        (if any) the individual needs to attend during PCS. The gaining unit needs to maintain a balance of
        required skills in the unit. Do not request training outside an individual’s primary AFSC.
        7.5.4.2. (Added-AMC) Ensure requests are complete and accurate. Monitor and review training
        request, ensure personnel meet prerequisites for training requested.
        7.5.4.3. (Added-AMC) The gaining unit will notify HQ AMC/A4MMT of any unique training
        requirements beyond core tasks within two weeks after notification of the inbound.
        (Added) NOTE: In rare instances, a gaining AMC unit commander may request a change in a
        RNLTD for an inbound non-AMC member who requires training en route.
     7.5.5. (Added-AMC) In the event of non-receipt of gaining unit requirements, HQ AMC/A4MMT
     may review the record and schedule training based on the projected duty position and RNLTD.

                                              Chapter 8

                     MAINTENANCE QUALIFICATION PROGRAM (MQP)

8.1. General. Qualification training is ongoing, providing adequate skills to accomplish all maintenance
tasks required. Each MAJCOM will develop and implement a MQP to achieve maintenance qualification
training IAW AFI 36-2201. MQP training should be conducted in a controlled environment that is not in
competition with sortie production. MTF, TD, and ADL courses can all be used to satisfy local training
requirements. All MAJCOM MQPs will incorporate a similar phased training process that meets the
intent of processes identified in this chapter.
NOTE: This chapter does not apply to ANG, AFRC and AFSOC Units. Specific qualification require-
ments for munitions, nuclear and missile activities are included in the appropriate AFI 21-2XX and AFI
21-114 series instructions and MAJCOM supplements.

8.2. Phase I, Inprocessing, Maintenance Orientation and Maintenance Refresher.
   8.2.1. Inprocess to base, wing, squadron, and unit training/MTF.
   8.2.2. Maintenance Orientation: Personnel will attend orientation within 60 days after arrival.
   8.2.3. Maintenance Refresher: This is recurring training conducted as a follow-up to the maintenance
   orientation.

8.3. Phase II, Continuation Training (CT).
   8.3.1. Continuation training is a structured training phase that standardizes specific AFSC training
   requirements. It consists of four sub-phases (Multiphase, MAJCOM Mandatory, Freeflow, and Main-
   tenance Qualification Training). It is designed to provide task oriented hands-on training. Phase II
   enhances and complements initial skills training by providing hands-on weapon system training and
   experience. It is designed to train personnel to perform maintenance task unsupervised and unassisted.
   Continuation training courses should provide a smooth learning transition while providing a logical
   building block approach for job qualification.
       8.3.1.1. Phase II training can be used to supplement OJT and to provide skill-level upgrade, qual-
       ification, CUT, or familiarization training. Phase II students are attached to the MTF and TD dur-
       ing training, but are officially assigned to their respective gaining organizations.
   8.3.2. Multiphase Students.

      9.3.1.6. Special Certification Roster (SCR).
9.4. (Added-AMC) Maintenance Training Devices (MTD).
   9.4.1. (Added-AMC) Training Support. HQ AMC purchases, maintains, and schedules MTDs for
   utilization by MQP/FTD maintenance students. Use MTDs as the primary source for initial skills
   training and follow-on training of specified tasks. The key purpose of MTDs is to minimize the impact
   of training requirements on operational aircraft. MTDs provide instructors with the platform neces-
   sary to accomplish task qualification training and perform task certification.
   9.4.2. (Added-AMC) MTDs are hardware or computer based devices designed or modified exclu-
   sively for training purposes that enhances learning, facilitate the development of skills, and permit the
   practice of proper procedures necessary for the maintenance of integrated systems of the prime mis-
   sion system.
      9.4.2.1. (Added-AMC) These devices use simulation/stimulation in construction or operation to
      demonstrate or illustrate a concept circumstance or environment.

        9.4.2.2. (Added-AMC) MTDs facilitate hands-on training, qualification, and certification of spe-
        cific tasks in the classroom and minimize the impact of maintenance training on operational air-
        craft.
     9.4.3. (Added-AMC) MTF/FTD instructors will consider use of MTDs as the first choice for training
     and in course development to minimize use of operational aircraft to the maximum extent possible.
     9.4.4. (Added-AMC) MTDs will support training and certification of new training requirements or
     aircraft changes. HQ AMC will ensure MTDs are concurrent with aircraft configuration through coor-
     dination with the System Program Officer (SPO), the Trainer Development Team (TDT) and other
     agencies as required. HQ AMC will provide trainer maintenance support throughout the lifecycle of
     the program to support valid maintenance training requirements. MTDs also:
        9.4.4.1. (Added-AMC) Reinforce systems and subsystems operation (theory).
        9.4.4.2. (Added-AMC) Identify system components (familiarization).
        9.4.4.3. (Added-AMC) Demonstrate system operation.
        9.4.4.4. (Added-AMC) Troubleshoot specific malfunctions (fault isolations).
        9.4.4.5. (Added-AMC) Remove and replace system components.
        9.4.4.6. (Added-AMC) Perform operation/ Built-In Testing (BIT) checks.

     9.4.5. (Added-AMC) Instructors will utilize the MTDs to train, evaluate, and certify task qualifica-
     tion.
     9.4.6. (Added-AMC) Determine and Evaluate Training Requirements. Maintenance instructors and
     SMEs must continually evaluate task-training requirements for validity and MTD applicability. If new
     tasks are identified or tasks are no longer required due to aircraft modification, action must be initiated
     to affect training standards (i.e. CFETP or AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/
     Command JQS), and CCDs. Curriculum changes may be initiated via annual/periodic review or Cur-
     riculum Advisory Council (CAC).
     9.4.7. (Added-AMC) Responsibilities for MTD Usage. HQ AMC/A4MMT capitalizes on both the
     MTF and FTD to provide optimum training and certification for maintenance technicians. MTF and
     FTD will work together to establish complementary and cohesive training programs in support of the
     operational mission.
        9.4.7.1. (Added-AMC) FTD will provide advance, transition, 3-level awarding courses, and any
        additional courses validated by HQ AMC/A4MMT.
        9.4.7.2. (Added-AMC) MTF will provide formalized On-the-Job Training (OJT), Production
        Team Maintenance (PTM) (e.g. jack, tow, refuel/defuel), and MXG or MAJCOM directed train-
        ing.
     9.4.8. (Added-AMC) MTD Management. HQ AMC procures and owns MTD assets for training
     maintenance personnel. MTF and FTD will jointly use MTDs as shared assets. Units will determine
     operating rules (e.g. scheduling, tours, operational hours) at the local level via an MOA. MOA will
     also cover: utilization reporting, currency deficiency and enhancements. Submit copy of MOA to HQ
     AMC/A4MMT.

      9.4.8.1. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC/A4MMT will task MTFs for Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
      support when development, modification, and upgrade of MTDs are required.
      9.4.8.2. (Added-AMC) MTF/FTD instructors will identify MTD deficiencies that result in use of
      operational aircraft and document any recommended MTD improvements to the TDT. Submit
      findings through the prime MTF to HQ AMC/A4MMT.
      9.4.8.3. (Added-AMC) TDT will coordinate all engineering change proposals (ECPs) effecting
      MTD changes and modifications through both the respective MTF/FTD instructor(s) and at least
      one MXG lead technician (SME) to ensure MTD design changes will meet AFSC training require-
      ment(s). Submit recommendations through the prime MTF to HQ AMC/A4MMT.
   9.4.9. (Added-AMC) Course Development and Validation Utilizing MTDs. MTF/FTD course objec-
   tives and MTD tasks must be supported by a validated and documented training requirement (e.g. 797,
   CFETP). Specific course objectives and MTD tasks not defined by a reference in the training standard
   must reference a sub-task and/or task in the training standard. MTD capabilities not supported by
   training standard references will be deleted. MTF/FTD will jointly conduct annual, or sooner if
   needed, ISR to determine and validate training requirements against MTD capability.
9.5. (Added-AMC) Formal Training.
   9.5.1. (Added-AMC) Annual Screening (EXCEPTION: Does not apply to AFRC units). The annual
   screening process is used to identify each unit’s Trained Personnel Requirement (TPR) for all avail-
   able formal school courses. This screening is accomplished IAW AMCI 36-2204, AMC Formal Train-
   ing Program. HQ AMC/A4MMT starts this process by sending a message to all MTFs tasking them to
   screen their units for future training requirements. This message includes the fiscal year(s) to screen
   for, as well as the format to provide the data for all Priority/Levels. All formal maintenance training
   requirements will be identified and consolidated through the Maintenance Training Flight. The course
   catalog can be accessed at https://etca.randolph.af.mil.
      9.5.1.1. (Added-AMC) Priority/Level 1, Mission Accomplishment, is training necessary to
      accomplish the day-to-day mission. In using this rating, commanders are validating training as
      mission essential and if AF funds cannot support the need, unit funds will be utilized. Priority/
      Level 1 requirements must be submitted to HQ AMC/A4MMT on AF Form 3933, MAJCOM
      Mission Training, accompanied by justification and signed by the unit training manager or func-
      tional manager and unit commanders. HQ AMC/A4MMT will assist functional managers in the
      preparation of additional AF Form 3933s for Priority/Level 1 requirements.
      9.5.1.2. (Added-AMC) Priority/Level 2, Mission Enhancement, is training required to improve
      mission capability. The unit commander must sign these requirements and units must plan/budget
      to fund. Unit commanders will limit their requirements to the number of quotas required to meet
      mission needs based on these training levels.
      9.5.1.3. (Added-AMC) During annual screening HQ AMC/A4MMT will provide a web link
      access form for the MTF to use for identifying requirements. HQ AMC/A4MMT will project for
      en route training. Although the format is determined by AETC, HQ AMC/A4MMT needs the data
      in column format (along with the AF Forms 3933, if applicable).
      9.5.1.4. (Added-AMC) Submit all requirements directly to HQ AMC/A4MMT. MTFs will con-
      solidate the requirements and forward to HQ AMC/A4MMT NLT the established suspense.

        9.5.1.5. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC/A4MMT will provide consolidated inputs to functional man-
        agers for review and validation. Once quotas are received, HQ AMC/A4MMT will assist func-
        tional managers with distribution of assigned quotas to the MTFs. Functional managers have final
        authority on distribution of assigned quotas when allocations are less than requested.
     9.5.2. (Added-AMC) Scheduling Formal Training. HQ AMC/A4MMT will provide quotas and class
     schedules to the MTFs within 30 days of receipt. The following guidelines provide procedures for
     scheduling personnel for the next quarter’s training and the confirmation of those allocations. MTFs/
     RTCs will:
        9.5.2.1. (Added-AMC) Ensure email allocation information reaches HQ AMC/A4MMT NLT 45
        days prior to the class start date. Units will use the electronic form, AMC Form 10, Formal School
        Quota Request Form to allocate quotas. The AMC Form 10 is located at the AMC Aircraft Main-
        tenance Training Enterprise site.
        9.5.2.2. (Added-AMC) Ensure personnel submitted for class meet all prerequisites.
        9.5.2.3. (Added-AMC) Certain courses (e.g., type 5) require additional information; see AMCI
        36-2204 for additional information required. The scheduler will request this information on an as
        needed basis.
        9.5.2.4. (Added-AMC) Out-of-Cycle Requests. Units submit requests approximately 45 days
        prior to class start date. HQ AMC/A4MMT cannot submit them any earlier than 30 days from the
        start date. Because of short notice notification ensure the member and UTM are aware of the
        request. All out-of-cycle requests are unit funded.
        9.5.2.5. (Added-AMC) Cancellations. When submitting a cancellation to a confirmed quota,
        UTMs must include name, SSAN, Training Line Number (TLN), course number and class ID.
        9.5.2.6. (Added-AMC) Substitutions. When a scheduled trainee becomes unavailable, a local

                                   ENGINE PRE-RUN TRAINING
A7.1. (Added-AMC) Engine Pre-Run Training. Pre-run training is designed to prepare the trainee for
successful completion of initial engine-run training. It will be conducted in the trainees work center
through OJT. Testing will be conducted via the command approved e-testing system. As a minimum,
pre-run training should include:
   A7.1.1. (Added-AMC) An evaluation by immediate supervisor or production supervisor that deter-
   mines whether prerequisites have been met and if individual possesses enough experience to become
   engine-run qualified.
   A7.1.2. (Added-AMC) A review and familiarization of engine-run procedures/limitations and emer-
   gency procedures (EP) by the trainee.
   A7.1.3. (Added-AMC) Prime MTFs may develop a handout that facilitates learning engine-run lim-
   itations and EPs.
   A7.1.4. (Added-AMC) A pre-test given by unit training composed of 25 questions on engine limita-
   tions and EP. A score of 100 percent on the EP portion and 90 percent, corrected to 100 percent, on
   normal procedures is required.
   A7.1.5. (Added-AMC) Prime MTFs will develop and maintain the applicable type/model aircraft,
   command standard test bank (with coordination from user MTFs) for the engine run, Auxiliary Power
   Unit (APU)/Ground Turbine Compressor (GTC)/Air Turbine Motor (ATM) and engine test facility
   systems. As a minimum the command standard test bank will consist of 80 normal operating proce-
   dure questions, and one question per bold-faced EP as identified in technical data. Using MTFs/RTCs
   will develop their own local tests from the test bank. Each local test will contain, as a minimum; 50
   questions for normal operating procedures (25 minimal for APU/GTC/ATM tests), which require a
   minimum passing score of 90 percent, corrected to 100 percent. Normal operating procedure ques-
   tions include limitations, responses to abnormal conditions, communications and precautions (warn-
   ings, cautions, notes). Normal operating procedure questions can be multiple choice or
   fill-in-the-blank (critical limitations). EP tests will include all bold-faced EPs, and require a 100 per-
   cent passing score. Tests are closed book and must be proctored and diligently controlled to prevent
   compromise.
   A7.1.6. (Added-AMC) Prime MTFs will accomplish an annual validation of the test bank to ensure
   questions are accurate and up to date IAW Technical Data.
   A7.1.7. (Added-AMC) User MTF/RTC revisions to instruction, manuals, technical data, administra-
   tive errors, or recommended changes will be reported to the Prime MTFs with rationale for changes.
   The Prime MTFs will evaluate the suggested change and reply in writing with rationale for agreement
   or disagreement.
   A7.1.8. (Added-AMC) Convene a CAC when new training requirements are identified.
