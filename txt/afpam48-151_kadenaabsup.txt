Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 48-1, Aerospace Medical Program, emphasizes that ‘the
ability of the Air Force to conduct effective and sustained combat operations depends largely on
the physical and mental health of its personnel’ and directs that the Air Force Medical Services
will focus on identifying and reducing the risk of illness and injury through appropriate
surveillance, prevention and control programs and measures. This Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM)
supports AFPD 48-1 in the area of Thermal Injury prevention by providing background
information and guidance to Commanders, supervisors and individuals at every level on
environmental measurement, recognition and prevention of the signs and symptoms of Thermal
Injury.

(KADENAAB) Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 48-151, Thermal Injury, 18 November 2002, is
supplemented as follows: The goal of the heat stress management program is to prevent heat-

related injuries through education and monitoring. This instruction applies to all 18th Wing,
tenant units, local and U.S. civilian employees, and U.S. Forces (non-Air Force) on Kadena Air
Base. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route
AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional chain of command. Ensure that
all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and
disposed of IAW Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS).

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

(KADENAAB) This instruction has been changed substantially and must be reviewed in its
entirety. Major changes are: Updated Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) Wet Bulb Globe
Temperature (WBGT) monitoring frequency during normal duty hours to every two hours.
Removed BE responsibility to post flag conditions on administrative WBGT website and train
fitness center personnel on updating website since website is no longer used for reporting.
Updated BE responsibility to provide recommendations to Emergency Operations Center BE
representative instead of Survival Recovery Center BE representative during contingency
operations and readiness exercises. Removed Risner Fitness Center responsibility of updating
the Kadena webpage since it is no longer used for reporting. Added Supervisor responsibility to
provide heat stress training initially and annually. Removed ability for Kadena personnel to
view current heat stress/flag conditions on Kadena home page. Added Kadena personnel will
receive updates from Command Post via AtHoc notification system when flag conditions reach
Black flag or when Black flag condition is no longer present. Added Command Post will
provide updates to various base organizations when flag conditions change. Added flag
conditions, water intake, and work/rest cycles are recommendations, not requirements, for
Commanders to observe and enhance awareness of conditions and monitoring for signs of heat
illness. Added monitoring of WBGT measurements will occur at building 428 and Risner
Fitness Center.

                                                 Chapter 1

                                             BACKGROUND

1.1. Introduction. AFPD 48-1 emphasizes that ‘the ability of the Air Force to conduct effective
and sustained combat operations depends largely on the physical and mental health of its
personnel.’ Moreover, it directs that the Air Force Medical Services will focus on identifying and
reducing the risk of illness and injury through appropriate surveillance, prevention and control
programs and measures. This AFPAM supports AFPD 48-1 in the area of thermal protection of
USAF personnel by providing background information and direction to Commanders,
supervisors and individuals on the measurement and prevention of thermal injury on USAF
personnel.
1.2. Purpose. The Purpose of this AFPAM is to provide guidance in the prevention and
treatment of thermal injury in USAF personnel.
1.3. Historical Perspective. History has demonstrated the difficulties of operating in hostile
thermal environments. Heat exhaustion was noted as a serious problem during medical support
operations to the 10th Air Force in India and Burma during WWII1. Furthermore, recent
deployed operations to the Middle East and the Balkans have emphasized the hostility and
unpredictability of the thermal environment. The thermal stresses upon, and subsequent thermal
strain experienced by, the war-fighter can have a detrimental effect upon mission success by
degrading both individual and, ultimately, collective performance. Such risk in the training
environment was highlighted by the recent deaths of recruits in the United Kingdom1 and the US
at Sandhurst and Lackland AFB respectively.
1.4. Basic Heat Exchange Principles. Thermal injury is caused by either a rise or fall in the
body’s core temperature. Control of human body temperature can be simplified in the following
heat balance equation:
Heat storage = Heat Gained - Heat Lost
     1.4.1. Heat may be gained from that generated by exercise, the surrounding environment and
     equipment. Heat loss is mainly through sweating although a small amount is lost through
     conduction and convection. Excess heat gain over heat loss may result in the storage of heat
     in the body and vice versa, the result of which is a rise or fall in the body core temperature
     with the associated potential for injury.
     1.4.2. Moreover, when individuals are wearing impermeable NBC clothing assemblies or
     protective clothing assemblies, personal fatigue and time to exhaustion are inversely related
     to the initial level of core body temperature and are directly related to the rate of heat
     storage1.
     1.4.3. Individual and collective risk of aircrew and ground crew error exists in thermal
     environmental extremes. Israeli research clearly demonstrated a significant increase in the
     risk of rotary aircrew errors associated with rising ambient temperatures2. Furthermore, in
     the training environment, measures taken in the Israeli Defense Force since the 1950s have

        reduced the incidence of exertional heat stroke (EHS) and formed the basis for a proactive
        heat intolerance-screening program2.
1.5. Definitions. The following definitions are used in this AFPAM:
        1.5.1. Heat Illness. Traditionally heat illness has been divided into heat exhaustion and
        heat stroke. In practice the division is difficult to define, thus, for the purpose of this
        AFPAM the term ‘Heat Illness’ is all embracing and applies to an individual who becomes
        incapacitated as the result of a rise in core body temperature.
        1.5.2. Cold Injury. Cold environments pose a threat to the individual if they exceed the
        capacity of the body’s thermo-regulatory response mechanisms. The main hazards are
        hypothermia associated with a fall in the body’s core temperature and/or tissue damage that
        falls under the broad headings of freezing cold injury (FCI) and non-freezing cold injury
        (NFCI). For the purpose of this AFPAM the term ‘Cold Injury’ is all embracing and applies
        to an individual who becomes incapacitated as the result of a drop in core body temperature,
        FCI or NFCI.

    GENERAL HEALTH SUPPORT, PREVENTIVE MEASURES AND RISK FACTORS

2.1. Training, Exercise and Operations. During training, exercises and operations,
Commanders must take into account general health support measures in hostile thermal
environments that complement specific temperature observations, comprising:
     2.1.1. Provision and management of appropriate work and rest schedules.
     2.1.2. Training and information to all assigned personnel in the recognition of the signs and
     symptoms and prevention of heat illness and cold injury combined with the maintenance of
     personnel’s general aerobic fitness.
     2.1.3. Provision of appropriate fluid replacement in both hot and cold environments.
     2.1.4. The associated implications of operating in a hot or cold environment while wearing
     impermeable clothing such as NBC warfare assemblies.
     2.1.5. Where the tempo of operations permits, the importance of acclimatization measures.
2.2. Preventive Measures. The key to the prevention of thermal injury is an awareness of
thermal risk factors by Commanders, supervisors and individuals at all levels. Any task
involving physical exertion in a hot or cold climate and subsequent exposure to high or low
ambient temperature should be considered a high-risk activity, particularly if NBC or
impermeable protective clothing assemblies are worn. Specifically, the risk of casualties from
work in heat or cold is dependent upon the environmental conditions, work rate and clothing
worn. When there is a thermal casualty risk, it is the Commander’s duty to ensure that resources
are available to undertake an appropriate risk assessment. A combination of administrative and
physical methods of risk management provides greater protection to a workforce than single
measures alone3.
2.3. Acclimatization to Heat. The process of acclimatization is characterized by a series of
physiological adjustments that occur when an individual is exposed to a hot climate.
Acclimatization must be specific for the destination environment and produce beneficial
physiological changes to the individual that minimize the risk of heat injury. Adaptation typically
occurs during the first 10 to 14 days of heat exposure and the largest change occurs at days 3 to
5. A period of acclimatization is required for all personnel regardless of each individual’s
physical condition. An individual is considered acclimatized if he or she has undertaken regular
exercise for longer than 10 days in the same environmental conditions as the proposed activity.
However, adaptation is lost within a few weeks unless the exposure to heat is repeated regularly
at intervals of four days or less. If exposure to the hot environment has followed a substantial
period of travel or crossing time zones, the acclimatization time must be assumed to be longer
than 10 days. In general, one extra day should be allowed for each time zone crossed. The effects
and potential benefits of heat acclimatization are shown in the table below4:

2.4. Individual Risk Factors for Heat Injury. There is wide variation in human tolerance to
heat stress. Nevertheless, it is possible to identify factors that cause particular individuals to
become heat casualties. The following personal factors must be considered when assessing
individual heat injury risk:
        2.4.1. Obesity.
        2.4.2. Lack of physical fitness and/or lack of sleep.
        2.4.3. Recent alcohol intake.
        2.4.4. Concurrent mild illness e.g., diarrhea, viral illness, fever.
        2.4.5. Dehydration.
        2.4.6. Medication or illegal drugs.
2.5. Individual Risk Factors for Cold Injury. Systematic review of accidental cold injury has
identified the following individual risk factors in a cold environment and must be considered5:
        2.5.1. Alcohol.
        2.5.2. Psychotropic medication.
        2.5.3. Insufficient clothing.
        2.5.4. Wetness from either the environment or sweat.
        2.5.5. Lean body mass.
        2.5.6. Physical exhaustion.
        2.5.7. Concomitant illness.
2.6. Environmental Assessment and Determination of Thermal Injury Risk. The risk of
thermal injury can be determined by an assessment of the thermal stress placed upon personnel
as a function of the air temperature, wind speed and humidity. Measurement indices of these
environmental parameters fall into 3 categories, according to their derivation and comprise:
        2.6.1. Indices that measure physical heat exchange but ignore the human physiological
        response to thermal stress. Examples include the Index of Thermal Stress 6 and the Heat
        Stress Index7.

       require further research13.

       thermal environments, such as the Effective Temperature Index14 and the Corrected Effective

       then thermal stress.
       2.6.4. Moreover, numerous indices exist which are of use to the thermal physiologist in the
       laboratory but are of little practical value to the flight surgeon, bio-environmental engineer or
       occupational physician in the field due to their complexity or difficulty in obtaining subject
       body core temperature measurements. Thus, this AFPAM utilizes those indices that can be
       easily applied, measured and interpreted when conducting both deployed or home base
       operations; namely the WBGT Index, FITS and WCT Index.

                                        THERMAL INDICES

3.1. The WBGT Index 16 . Detailed analysis of the influence of the environment on thermal
stress requires a knowledge of the following 4 basic parameters; air temperature; mean radiant
temperature, air speed and absolute humidity. The WBGT Index combines the measurement of
two derived parameters, natural wet bulb temperature (Tnwb) and the black globe temperature
(Tbg) and, in some situations, the measurement of the basic parameter, air temperature (Tdb).
The WBGT index can be determined using either the field apparatus described in the American
Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limits Values (TLV)
and Biological Exposure Indices (BEI) Handbook, the portable hand-held WBGT kit (NSN
6665-00-159-2218) or a suitable commercially available apparatus. The WBGT formulae are as
follows17:
     3.1.1. WBGT = 0.7Tnwb + 0.2Tbg + 0.1Tdb C (Outdoors).
     3.1.2. WBGT = 0.7Tnwb + 0.3Tbg C (Absent Solar Load or Indoors).
(Where Tnwb = natural wet bulb, Tbg = black globe and Tdb = dry bulb temperatures)
     3.1.3. Thermal stress indices that account for the thermal environment provide further
     guidance to Commanders against which they can judge the risk of injury to their subordinates
     against the mission requirements. Therefore, the measurement of the WBGT index must
     closely relate to the training or working conditions.
     3.1.4. Base Bioenvironmental Engineering (BEE) personnel are usually responsible for
     WBGT measurement and must specify in local instructions where estimations are to be
     taken. Base weather personnel may perform additional measurements. The data collected is
     to be compared to reference values shown at Table A2.1 and Table A2.2 at Attachment 2
     and, when necessary, used to implement administrative and personnel procedures to directly
     reduce thermal strain and subsequent thermal stress at the work place.
        3.1.4.1. (Added-KADENAAB) 18th Aerospace Medicine Squadron, Bioenvironmental
        Engineering (BE) Flight (18 AMDS/SGPB) will:
            3.1.4.1.1. (Added-KADENAAB) When the predicted or forecasted outside
            temperatures reach 85 degrees Fahrenheit as a daily high (typically May through
            October), BE will perform Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) measurements
            every 2 hours during the normal duty hours. Monitoring will be performed hourly
            during readiness exercises and during 24-hour operations as long as attack and post-
            attack situations will permit such monitoring. WBGT will be located outside building
            428 when monitoring is in progress.
            3.1.4.1.2. (Added-KADENAAB) Report the WBGT index to the 18th Wing
            Command Post via telephone for dissemination to base personnel and the community
            when the index is equal or greater than 85 degrees Fahrenheit. This organization is

        appropriate colored flag in front of the Risner Fitness Center. The color of the flag
        corresponds with the WBGT index and is to be changed by Risner Fitness Center
        staff with each new change.
     3.1.4.5. (Added-KADENAAB) Supervisors will:
        3.1.4.5.1. (Added-KADENAAB) Disseminate the WBGT index to workers when
        informed through the notification procedures.
        3.1.4.5.2. (Added-KADENAAB) Provide heat stress training to all assigned
        personnel initially and annually. Training should include the signs and symptoms of
        heat stress, prevention of heat illness, heat stress index concepts and warnings, first
        aid treatment of heat illness, and effects of wearing restrictive/impermeable clothing
        (MOPP gear, IPE, chemical protection suits, fire-fighting ensemble) while exposed to
        local climate conditions.

        3.1.4.6. (Added-KADENAAB) Unit Physical Training Leaders (PTLs) will:
            3.1.4.6.1. (Added-KADENAAB) Ensure adherence to physical conditioning
            limitations associated with flag/heat conditions. It is the responsibility of the PTLs
            and supervisors to remain aware of the current flag condition when performing
            organized physical training or fitness testing outdoors throughout the year with
            greater emphasis during May through October. Additional guidance is provided in
            Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2905, Fitness Program, Attachment 8.
     3.1.5. BEE personnel should establish normal, expected and average WBGT index
     measurements for occupationally heat exposed personnel in indoor environments or confined
     spaces. When the forecast outside temperature reaches 85F as a daily high WBGT
     measurements are to be taken a minimum of 4 times, evenly spaced, during the hottest part of
     the day.
     3.1.6. Thermal stress levels are to be displayed around the base by using a color-coded
     system, such as flags or boards as highlighted at Table A2.2 of Attachment 2. Consideration
     must be given to increasing the frequency of WBGT measurements in particularly hot
     environments.
     3.1.7. (Added-KADENAAB) Access to Current Flag Conditions.
        3.1.7.1. (Added-KADENAAB) Kadena personnel will receive updates from Command
        Post via AtHoc notification system when flag conditions reach Black flag or when Black
        flag condition is no longer present.
        3.1.7.2. (Added-KADENAAB) Command Post will provide updates to various base
        organizations when flag conditions change.
        3.1.7.3. (Added-KADENAAB) Risner Fitness Center staff will display current flag
        conditions in front of the Risner Fitness Center.
        3.1.7.4. (Added-KADENAAB) Personnel are reminded that heat stress measurements
        are not taken during periods of rain due to possible damage of the electronic equipment.
        3.1.7.5. (Added-KADENAAB) Personnel are reminded that flag conditions, water
        intake, and work/rest cycles are recommendations, not directives or requirements, for
        Commanders to observe work/rest cycles and to enhance awareness of heat conditions
        and monitoring for signs of heat illness.
3.2. FITS. The FITS was developed in the late 1970s18 to provide a measure of the thermal
stress experienced by aircrew in fast jet aircraft with canopies and environmental control
systems, engaged in combat sorties at low level altitude. The FITS is based upon the following
formula:
     3.2.1. (F)= 0.83Twb + 0.35Tdb + 5.08
     3.2.2. The calculated values assume an Aircrew Equipment Assembly (AEA) thermal
     insulation of 1.5-2.0 clo, roughly equivalent to light, summer AEA. Therefore, the index is
     not appropriate for cold weather, immersion suit or NBC assemblies. Nevertheless, in hot

     environments, the FITS provides a measure of thermal strain required to determine the risk of
     aircrew heat stress and injury, and minimizes the potential risk of error.
     3.2.3. Meteorological staffs in conjunction with BEE personnel are to determine jointly the
     FITS zones shown at Table A3.1 of Attachment 3 based upon the WBGT measurement.
     Squadron Operations Flights then determine the zone applicability within the aircrew-
     working environment and display the appropriate warning color for aircrew. Aircrew have a
     responsibility to monitor their physical condition and not to exceed their capability to safely
     accomplish the mission. The following zone limits of exposure are recommendations only;
     Wings should develop additional restrictions if the mission requirements allow.
     3.2.4. FITS Caution Zone. The following procedures should be implemented:
        3.2.4.1. Be alert for symptoms of heat stress.
        3.2.4.2. Drink plenty of non-caffeinated fluids.
        3.2.4.3. Avoid exercise 4 hours prior to take off.
        3.2.4.4. Limit ground operations time to 90 minutes outside an air-conditioned
        environment.
     3.2.5. FITS Danger zone. In addition to the above procedures:
        3.2.5.1. Minimum recovery time, landing time to next take off between flights is 2 hours.
        3.2.5.2. Limit ground operations to 45 minutes for fighter/trainer aircraft types; time
        outside air-conditioned environment.
        3.2.5.3. If possible, wait in a cool shaded area if the aircraft is not ready to fly.
        3.2.5.4. Complete a maximum of 2 aircraft inspections, 2 exterior inspections on initial
        sorties and 1 exterior inspection on subsequent sorties for fighters and trainers.
        3.2.5.5. Undergraduate Flying Training solo students are to complete 1 exterior aircraft
        inspection per sortie.
3.3. The WCT19. Cold injury prevention relies upon minimizing exposure and reducing heat
loss using clothing. Operations in cold regions of the world expose personnel to the hazards of
cold stress and consequent risk of hypothermia, FCI and NFCI. On 1 Nov 01, Air Force Weather
Units implemented the revised WCT Index Chart for 2001/2002 shown at Table A4.1 of
Attachment 4. Specifically the new calculation accounts for:
     3.3.1. A calculated wind speed at an average height of five feet or the typical height of an
     adult human face based on readings from the national standard height of 33 feet, the typical
     height of an anemometer.
     3.3.2. Basis on a human face model.
     3.3.3. Modern heat transfer theory and heat loss from the body to the surroundings during
     cold and breezy or windy days.
     3.3.4. Lowering the calm wind threshold to 3 mph.

 THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPLICATION OF THE WBGT, FITS AND WCT INDICES.

4.1. Fluid Replacement. Water is the key component of sweat that enables heat loss to occur.
Therefore it is essential to maintain fluid intake to meet losses secondary to evaporation and
maintain hydration. All water referred to in this AFPAM is to be cool, potable and from a
guaranteed safe source.
       4.1.1. Thirst is an unreliable guide to the level of hydration in either a hot or cold
       environment. Personnel are to drink adequate water before, during and after high thermal risk
       activities. Urine color is a reliable indicator of an individual’s hydration status. Personnel
       exposed to either extreme of hot or cold environments are to be instructed to drink sufficient
       water that their urine remains colorless. The risks of over hydration and potential electrolyte
       imbalance are to be emphasized to all personnel. Examples of fluid intake for given
       workloads are displayed below:

moderate, light work and rest (after Sawka and Montain, 2000)

Exercise Heat Stress’, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Vol 72, No 2, p566
4.2. Fluid Composition, Sodium Intake and Dietary Supplementation. Replacement fluid
composition remains the subject of academic debate and research. The Military Committee on
Nutritional Research (199420) considered electrolyte replacement, endurance and performance.
In summary, there was little direct evidence that electrolyte supplementation was beneficial
except in a small proportion of endurance athletes. However, the low concentrations of
electrolytes found in most fluid replacement beverages can enhance palatability and thus serve to
encourage fluid consumption. Notwithstanding this potential benefit, the only study to examine

high sodium intake, both as a supplement to diet in food and electrolyte drinks, during heat
acclimatization found detrimental cardiovascular and performance effects. Under-hydration was
postulated as a potential mechanism since 1 liter of water must be consumed for each 5g of
sodium chloride added to the diet21. Personnel are to be encouraged to maintain a normal diet,
with supplemental salt to taste and must maintain a regular intake of water. Palatability of fluids
may be enhanced by the addition of commercial electrolyte powders IAW AFMOA/CC policy22.
4.3. Workload and Fluid Intake in Hot Environments. Guidelines for work/rest schedules
and fluid intake in the WBGT precaution zones for both acclimatized and un-acclimatized
personnel in a hot environment are shown at Table A5.1 and Table A5.2 of Attachment 5
respectively. Table A6.1 and Table A6.2 of Attachment 6 provide a broad description of
advisory work/rest schedules against WBGT index and a broad guide to the determination of
workload intensity respectively. Line managers are to ensure that all personnel under their
supervision are aware of these limitations.
4.4. Workload and Fluid Intake in Cold Environments. In cold environments the principle
routes of fluid loss and subsequent deficit are cold induced diuresis, respiratory water loss, cold
weather clothing, and the metabolic cost of movement and reduced fluid intake. Personnel
should be encouraged to maintain fluid intake in accordance with the un-acclimatized
recommendations at Table A5.1 and Table A5.2 at Attachment 5. Theoretically, glycerol
solutions may be appropriate fluid replacement in cold environments to delay gastric emptying
and promote fluid absorption, however, this area requires further study. Personnel are to be
encouraged to eat a normal diet, incorporating moderate carbohydrate and fat intake.
4.5. Precautionary Measures During Exercise in the Heat. The following general
precautionary measures are to be applied when exercising in heat:
     4.5.1. Clothing should be lightweight, loose fitting and preferably natural fiber. Dress and
     equipment increase the risk of heat illness by increasing workload and by reducing the body
     area available for the evaporation of sweat. In hot environments, loose fitting clothing is to
     be worn, particularly at the neck and wrists to allow air circulation. Furthermore, appropriate
     headgear is to be worn, in addition to the use of sun block to prevent sunburn.
     4.5.2. When Battle Dress Uniform (BDU) is required for a particular activity, the use of
     BDU Hot Weather is to be mandated and enforced when a yellow flag or higher WBGT heat
     condition is expected for the day. The wearing of helmets and combat armor significantly
     increases heat stress during strenuous activity. Five degrees F is to be added to the WBGT
     index if individuals are wearing combat armor.
     4.5.3. During endurance exercise small quantities of fluid should be drunk at frequent
     intervals and water sprayed on the skin at every opportunity.
     4.5.4. The use of sweat inhibiting deodorants should be avoided.
     4.5.5. Personnel should not exercise in the heat immediately after a glucose or high
     carbohydrate meal due to the diversion of blood from the skin to the gastrointestinal tract.
     4.5.6. Endurance events should be cancelled if the WBGT index exceeds 82F.

4.6. Specialist Occupations in a Hot Environment. When individuals are working in ground
crew ensemble, fire fighting gear or other similar restrictive or impermeable clothing, BEE
personnel are to arrange remote onsite or workplace measurement of the WBGT index. For these
specialist-clothing ensembles 10 degrees F is to be added to the WBGT measurement before
applying the work schedule guidelines at Table A5.1 and Table A5.2 of Attachment 5. A
further 5 degrees WBGT should be added if individuals are wearing combat armor.
4.7. Cold Environment Considerations. Cold impinges on the safety of flight operations by a
variety of mechanisms comprising:
     4.7.1. Exposure of arms and hands with subsequent reduction in sensation and manual
     dexterity.
     4.7.2. Discomfort and subsequent distraction.
     4.7.3. Limitation of movement and duties while wearing bulky protective clothing.
     4.7.4. Contact with freezing metal components and risk of FCI.
     4.7.5. Dehydration.
     4.7.6. Sleep deprivation is associated with higher sensations of cold and shivering23.
4.8. Cold Exposure Reduction. Advisory work/rest schedules and practices in a cold
environment are shown at Table A4.2 of Attachment 424. Moreover, the following may reduce
cold exposure:
     4.8.1. Elimination of non-essential outdoor tasks.
     4.8.2. Where possible, performing tasks indoors.
     4.8.3. Provision of temporary shelter for essential outdoors work, preferably heated.
     4.8.4. Increasing the number of personnel allocated to a task and operating a rotational duty
     system.
     4.8.5. Layered protective clothing systems are available to both aircrew and ground crew.
4.9. NBC Operations and Uncompensable Heat Stress (UCHS). NBC or impermeable
protective clothing ensembles significantly increase the thermal load placed upon the individual
that resulting in uncompensable heat stress. Further guidance on work/rest schedules and the
importance of fluid balance in a NBC environment is available in Air Force Manual 32-4005,
Personnel Protection and Attack Actions. Further, a variety of physiological factors may
minimize the subsequent thermal strain experienced by individuals in MOPP ensembles.
Following laboratory exercise experiments conducted in the Canadian NBC assembly, Cheung
and McLennan25 concluded that:

   4.9.1. High aerobic fitness from long-term training and habitual exercise is of significant
   benefit.
   4.9.2. When fluid replacement is provided, heat acclimation does not provide significant
   benefit regardless of fitness status. Fluid replacement may, therefore, be an effective
   substitute for a heat-acclimation program.
   4.9.3. The magnitude of improvements in physiological strain with heat acclimation is
   greater in those subjects with high aerobic fitness, but the improvements are still insufficient
   to improve exercise-heat tolerance.
   4.9.4. Mild hypo-hydration of 2-3% of body mass results in significant performance
   impairment, regardless of fitness or heat acclimation status.
4.10. Training and Education. Personnel assigned to hot or cold weather operations should
receive thorough training in the bio-medical problems of heat and cold, with continuation
training annually. Training should include the subtle psychomotor signs of thermal injury.
Suggested topics include the following:
   4.10.1. Climate. Local weather conditions, heat stress index concepts and warnings, wind-
   chill concepts and warnings.
   4.10.2. Heat Illness. Fluid replacement, work/rest schedules, signs and symptoms, first aid
   treatment.
   4.10.3. Cold Injury. Signs and symptoms of freezing and non-freezing cold injuries, human
   performance in the cold, psychomotor effects, fluid replacement.
   4.10.4. Protective Clothing Systems. Principles of use, design, proper wear and maintenance,
   risk of wet clothing, associated hazards of protective clothing systems including reduced
   mobility, impaired hearing, visual fields and generation of static electricity.
   4.10.5. NBC Operations and Heat Stress in both hot and cold environments.

                                             Chapter 5

   FIRST AID AND EMERGENCY TREATMENT GUIDANCE FOR HEAT & COLD
                              INJURY

5.1. Heat Illness. Recognition of heat illness is the key principle in treatment and management.
In general, any individual experiencing the following signs or symptoms during physical activity
in a hot environment or while wearing protective clothing should be presumed to be suffering
from heat illness:
   5.1.1. Dizziness or confusion.
   5.1.2. Nausea or vomiting.
   5.1.3. Staggering.
   5.1.4. Disturbed vision.
   5.1.5. Confusion, collapse or loss of consciousness.
5.2. Heatstroke. Heatstroke develops when the body is unable to dissipate excess heat under
various combinations of high environmental temperature, high humidity, lack of wind, vigorous
activity, heat retaining clothing, and dehydration. Early symptoms include excessive sweating,
headache, nausea, dizziness, hyperventilation, and disturbance of consciousness. Consciousness
may be lost or clouded and there may be hallucinations. There may be muscle twitching or
convulsions and loss of control of the body sphincters. In severe cases there may be deep coma
with pinpoint pupils and shock with tachycardia. Tachypnoea is often present and breathing may
become difficult and vomit subsequently inhaled. The patient feels warm or hot and has a high
core temperature usually in excess of 103F. Sweating may or may not be present. The diagnosis
depends upon a high index of suspicion.
   5.2.1. Treatment of Heatstroke. Heatstroke victims are in danger of developing
   irreversible damage of the brain, kidneys, liver, and adrenal glands with subsequent death.
   Disseminated intra-vascular coagulation may occur. Treatment should be started as early as
   possible. Unnecessary cooling is safer than waiting for a definite diagnosis. On suspicion of
   heat stroke the following guidelines may be applied:
       5.2.1.1. Lie the patient flat and raise the legs.
       5.2.1.2. Cool by removing clothing, spraying with warm or tepid water, and fanning with
       warm air. Do NOT use ice baths, ice packs, cold sponging, or blowing cold air; the
       resulting cold stimulus may cause vasoconstriction, reduce heat loss, trigger shivering
       and increase heat production.
       5.2.1.3. Re-hydrate with sodium rich fluid such as 0.9% saline. Several liters may be
       required to restore or maintain blood pressure. Intravenous bicarbonate will be needed to
       counteract the metabolic acidosis, however, this is best achieved in hospital once a
       measurement of acid/base status has been completed. Repeated doses of hydrocortisone
       100 mg intravenously may be necessary if the blood pressure is falling. Transfer to a
       hospital intensive therapy unit.

5.3. Heat Syncope, Heat Exhaustion and Heat Cramps. Heat exhaustion is caused by
excessive exposure to heat and the depletion of body fluids. Victims sweat profusely and may
shiver and have goose bumps. Weakness, nausea, dizziness, headache, poor judgment, rapid
pulse, and a normal or slightly elevated body temperature are present. Heat cramps occur in
healthy individuals during or following strenuous physical activity. Muscles, oftentimes those in
the calf, cramp and produce severe pain. Fainting from the heat is referred to as heat syncope.
Treatment includes rest in a cool, shaded environment and fluid replacement. Cramped muscles
should be stretched or massaged.
5.4. Sunburn. Unprotected exposure to sun can cause sunburn, accelerate skin aging, may
cause drug photosensitization and depress skin immune responses. Sunburn also increases the
risks of skin cancer; basal and squamous cell carcinomas on exposed areas and melanomas
anywhere on the body. Altitude and reflective surfaces such as fresh ice, snow, sand, metal,
concrete and wind increase the risk and severity of sunburn.
     5.4.1. Sunburn Prevention and Treatment. Clothing and sunscreens according to skin
     type can prevent sunburn. Sunscreens are to protect against ultraviolet (UV) A and UV B and
     provide a minimum sun protective factor of 15. The table below outlines sunburn treatment
     guidelines:

Table 5.1. Sunburn Treatment Guidelines.
                    Mild sunburn                     Severe sunburn (blistering)
 Avoid further exposure Cool soak-tap water As for mild sunburn plus: Prednisolone oral
 Emollients                                          60 mg/day, tapering in one week
 Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-               Protect bullae if intact
 inflammatory drugs                                  Admit to hospital
 Topical steroids


5.5. Cold Injury. If body heat loss exceeds heat production then hypothermia will develop. The
condition is defined as occurring when the body’s core temperature falls to 95 F or below.
Recognizing the early signs and symptoms of hypothermia is the key to treatment and
management. These include:
     5.5.1. Profound shivering.
     5.5.2. Slurred speech.
     5.5.3. Psychological symptoms including aggressive or withdrawn behavior.
     5.5.4. Progressive reduction in the shivering response and loss of consciousness.
5.6. Hypothermia . Hypothermia is defined as a core temperature below 95°F and develops as
the rate of heat loss exceeds heat production. Three types of hypothermia can be distinguished,
based upon the mechanism of cold exposure comprising26:

AFPAM48-151_KADENAABSUP_I 30 MAY 2014                                                         21


  5.6.1. Immersion. Very severe cold stress occurs, for example, following ejection into
  water.
  5.6.2. Exhaustion. Less severe cold stress, most frequently following a combination of
  wind and wet exposure with moderately low temperatures.
  5.6.3. Urban. Cold is relatively mild and prolonged. Most common in the elderly or
  malnourished, this condition may be seen in Peace Support or Humanitarian operations.
  5.6.4. Diagnosis of Hypothermia. In a cold environment, the possibility of hypothermia
  should always be suspected. Early symptoms comprise changes in behavior followed by
  uncoordinated movement, staggering, dysarthria and subsequent clouding and loss of
  consciousness (Grumble, Mumble, Fumble, and Stumble) with an eventual fall in heart and
  respiratory rate with death as the final outcome. It should be noted that similar symptoms
  occur in hyperthermia, exhaustion, and hypoglycemia. Measuring the core temperature,
  usually rectally, aids accurate diagnosis. However, low reading thermometers may not be
  readily available where casualties occur thus, for practical purposes, an individual should be
  treated as a cold casualty if the body feels "as cold as marble," particularly if the armpit is
  profoundly cold.
  5.6.5. Pre-Hospital Management of Hypothermia. In all three preceding situations,
  removing the casualty from the cold environment prevents further heat loss. Movement must
  be gentle in order to avoid triggering cardiac arrest. Until the casualty is in shelter wet
  clothes should not be removed. Layers of insulating material should be placed on top of the
  casualty’s clothing, including the head, and covered with a layer that is water and wind proof.
  Foil blankets are often recommended, but are no more effective than a similar thickness of
  very much cheaper plastic. These measures will probably be sufficient in immersion
  hypothermia. If available, airway warming, through the inhalation of warmed moist air,
  should be used. This treatment is of particular value in hypothermia secondary to exhaustion
  where it can prevent the occurrence of fatal cardiovascular collapse during re-warming. With
  urban hypothermia no additional heat, either surface or central, should be supplied before
  admission to hospital, as this may precipitate fatal pulmonary or cerebral edema or both by
  reversing inter-compartmental fluid shifts.
  5.6.6. Resuscitation after Hypothermia. Respiratory obstruction should be cleared and, if
  necessary, expired air ventilation started using the same criteria and rate as in normothermia.
  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, at the same rate as in normothermia, should be started if
  indicated. Casualties totally submerged in very cold water, especially those who are young,
  have been known to recover even after submersion of up to one hour. Resuscitation must
  start immediately on rescue. The indications for commencing cardio-pulmonary resuscitation
  comprise:
     5.6.6.1. No carotid pulse is detectable for at least one minute OR cardiac arrest is
     observed; that is, the pulse disappears or there is a reasonable chance that cardiac arrest
     occurred within the previous two hours.
     5.6.6.2. There should be a reasonable expectation that effective cardiopulmonary
     resuscitation can be continued, with only brief periods of interruption for movement, until
     the casualty can be transported to hospital and advanced life support can be provided.

5.7. Freezing and Non-Freezing Cold Injury. As skin temperature approaches 30 F, intense
vasoconstriction of peripheral blood vessels takes place with the potential for freezing of tissues
and subsequent frostbite (FCI). Moreover, prolonged contact with water or wet clothing in the
temperature range of 53 F can result in NFCI, a condition where the peripheral nerves de-
myelinate with resultant swelling, numbness and blanching followed some time later by intense
pain and hyperemia in the affected body area. The following freezing cold injuries are described:
   5.7.1. Frostbite. Frostbite is a localized lesion caused by freezing, usually affecting the feet,
   hands, ears, nose, and cheeks. The cornea has been affected in individuals not protected by
   goggles. Penile freezing can occur during exercise in tight or inadequate clothing or from
   direct contact with a metal zipper. Restricted peripheral circulation secondary to tight shoes
   or boots can increase the risk of frostbite as does dehydration, fatigue and exposure at
   altitude. In frostbite the tissues are hard, insensitive, and white or mottled. No attempt should
   be made to thaw frostbite if there is any chance of the affected area becoming re-frozen. The
   freeze-thaw-re-freeze cycle causes greater damage than continuous freezing. It is safer to
   walk on frozen feet even for 72 hours.
   5.7.2. Frostnip. In frostnip painful exposed skin blanches and loses sensation but remains
   pliable. The affected area should be warmed by placing it in the armpit or under clothing.
   Tingling is followed by hyperemia and within a few minutes sensation is restored and normal
   activity can be resumed.
   5.7.3. Treatment. Re-warming should be carried out in a hot whirlpool bath, with gradual
   spontaneous rewarming as a second option. Beating, rubbing with snow, or rewarming with
   excessive heat can produce disastrous loss of tissue. Since damage from frostbite is usually
   more superficial than first suspected, debridement or amputation should be delayed for up to
   90 days till mummification and demarcation are complete. After recovery the sufferer can
   return to full activities with limitations imposed by the degree of any tissue loss.
   5.7.4. NFIC. NFCI is characterized by tissue damage following prolonged exposure to
   temperatures above freezing, classically in the region of 59F. The following clinical
   presentations are identified:
       5.7.4.1. Trench foot. Trench foot is the common title for non-freezing cold injury;
       others include immersion injury, paddy foot, tropical immersion foot and peripheral
       vasoneuropathy after chilling. Peripheral nerve de-myelination with potential muscle
       necrosis and atrophy develops over a long period of time as the affected body part is
       exposed to cold temperatures of around 60F. Although the term ‘trench foot’ suggests
       that the lower limbs are the most common site for NFCI, any body part may be affected;
       for example the buttocks may be injured when exposed to cold water or continuous
       surface contact while in a dinghy. Furthermore, prolonged walking on boggy ground or
       sweating in impervious boots may create similar cold and wet conditions. As in frostbite,
       damage is more likely if the casualty is also suffering from fatigue, dehydration,
       immobility, or wearing tight footwear. The feet are initially cold and numb, giving the
       sensation of "walking on cotton wool" and in combination with joint stiffness, the
       casualty walks with legs apart in order to maintain balance. Initial examination reveals
       feet that are cold, swollen, and blotchy pink-purple or blanched.
       5.7.4.2. Treatment. Remove the person from the cold environment and allow the
       affected body part to rewarm spontaneously. After rewarming, the feet become
AFPAM48-151_KADENAABSUP_I 30 MAY 2014                                                         23


       hyperemic, hot, and red with paraesthesia or pain, often similar to electric shocks. These
       symptoms may be severe and last for several weeks, especially on weight bearing. Severe
       cases produce bleeding into the skin, ulceration, and blistering that may progress to
       gangrene. Consequent to nerve and other tissue damage, there is likely to be persistent or
       permanent hypersensitivity to cold with anesthesia or hyperaesthesia or problems with
       the bony structure of the feet.
5.8. Other Effects of Cold. Further to FCI and NFCI the following may also be seen in a cold
environment:
   5.8.1. Raynaud’s Disease/Syndrome. Cold at a severity that does not affect normal people
   may cause severe arterial vasoconstriction, most commonly affecting the fingers, in
   individuals with Raynaud's Syndrome. In severe cases this may lead to digital ulceration and
   tissue loss. Protection from the cold by suitable clothing, gloves and shoes is usually
   sufficient however chemical hand warmers may be necessary. Individuals with Raynaud’s
   are strongly advised not to smoke.
   5.8.2. Muscle injury. Muscle and tendon tears may occur when a person is cold, since
   muscle action is inefficient and may be uncoordinated in concert with joint stiffness. An
   active warm up, sufficiently energetic and prolonged to ensure that the whole body is warm
   is an effective means for reducing the risk of injury and enhancing performance.
   5.8.3. Shivering. Cold causes shivering that can produce a performance deficit in manual
   skills that require steadiness.
   5.8.4. Reduced Manual Dexterity. The fingers are much less sensitive in the cold with
   subsequent loss of manual dexterity. Cold impairs coordination, reduces visual acuity,
   general alertness and slows reflexes. Individuals are prone to making mistakes in the cold
   and may misinterpret sights or sounds. Prolonged hypoxia or exposure to cold can cause
   hallucinations, particularly at altitude.

                                          SUMMARY

6.1. Summary. In summary, this pamphlet provides guidance for the prevention of thermal
illness secondary to heat or cold exposure. Thermal illness may follow a rise or fall in body core
temperature that is not compensated by the individual’s thermo-regulatory system. Further,
exposure of the extremities or bare skin to cold air or water may result in tissue damage and
subsequent cold injury. The fundamental approach to be taken by Commanders is one of risk
assessment and management.
6.2. Commander’s Summary. Commanders should make every effort to protect personnel
under their command from the adverse effects of the environment, allowing for the operational
imperative, in order to maximize mission efficiency. Furthermore, the additional stresses placed
upon individuals when operating in NBC equipment in a thermally hostile environment, should
also be considered.
6.3. Comprehensive Approach. Although medical personnel have an active input in the
prevention and treatment of thermal casualties, the multi-disciplinary approach of utilizing BEE,
Public Health, Weather and Ops personnel in establishing and monitoring the thermal
environment provides a comprehensive assessment of risk to personnel. Moreover, the overall
approach to thermal injury prevention and risk management, in equal measure, involves
administrative techniques as well as physical. Thus, this document provides guidance to
Commands on thermal measurement techniques, assessment tools, work and rest schedules and
basic medical treatment guidelines.
