1. Utility Bill Payments.
   1.1. Introduction:
       1.1.1. Purpose. Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) executes in excess of two
       hundred million dollars annually (direct budget authority plus reimbursement) for
       purchased utilities. Failure to make prompt payment through the Defense Finance and
       Accounting Service (DFAS) to the provider can result in significant late fees and interest
       penalties. This AFMCI outlines a bill paying process required to reduce or eliminate late
       fees and interest penalties as they relate to utility bills.
   1.2. Scope.
       1.2.1. The Prompt Payment Act (PPA) of May 21, 1982 (Public Law 97-177), amended
       on October 17, 1988 (Public Law 100-496) 31 U.S.C. 3900 requires Federal agencies to
2                                                                  AFMCI65-700 11 JULY 2009


       make payments in a timely manner. Compliance procedures are outlined in DoD FMR
       7000.14-R, Vol 10, Ch 1 & 7.
       1.2.2. This particular Air Force Materiel Command Instruction (AFMCI) provides
       instruction for payment of utility bill invoices which can be retrieved on line, through e-
       mail or through regular mail.
    1.3. Methodology. Each AFMC base will implement the process outlined in this AFMCI to
    best fit their particular organization. Bases will review their late fees and interest penalties
    monthly and HQ AFMC/A7R will review and report quarterly.
    1.4. Process:
       1.4.1. Utility Bill Payment Process. Command standard process is outlined below and
       must be implemented at all AFMC installations. However, process flexibility is
       permissible to allow for base unique conditions.
       1.4.2. Receive bill (optimally check all online accounts for current invoices or receive
       through email set-up; least preferred method is by regular mail).
       1.4.3. Print outstanding invoices for online or email billing.
       1.4.4. Date stamp all invoices upon receipt.
       1.4.5. Utility engineer certify invoice for payment (bases have option to accomplish this
       step after payment has been made and adjust any corrections on next bill to avoid delays).
       1.4.6. Verify funds availability.
       1.4.7. Ensure accounting information on invoice.
       1.4.8. Prepare an SF 1034, Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than
       Personal, to accompany the invoice when sent to DFAS (refer to Department of Defense
       Guidebook                 for                 Miscellaneous                Payments
       http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/eb/miscellaneous_pay.html). SF 1034 must be
       completed in accordance with FMR Volume 10, chapters 1 and 7 (also found in
       Appendix F of the Defense Guidebook).
       1.4.9. Prepare fax cover sheet, date stamp invoice again indicating date sent to DFAS,
       and then fax to DFAS with original Miscellaneous Obligation Reimbursement document
       (MORD) and the SF 1034.
       1.4.10. Update MORD balance.
       1.4.11. Establish follow-up suspense to ensure on-time DFAS receipt/payment. Log into
       Electronic Document Access (EDA) to verify DFAS received fax.
       1.4.12. If paid, print DFAS payment voucher from EDA by choosing Electronic
       Document Management/Electronic File Room (EDM/EFR) and verify payment was
       made prior to due date and to the correct utility provider; if not paid follow-up with
       DFAS.
       1.4.13. Verify EDA established post date for voucher payment in Commanders Resource
       Integrated System (CRIS).
       1.4.14. Annotate payment voucher information on invoice and file.
AFMCI65-700 11 JULY 2009                                                                        3


  1.5. Best Practices: In addition to the bill paying process previously outlined, the below
  seven best practices should be adopted locally at each AFMC installation:
     1.5.1. Assign ownership of the process to responsible individual (s).
     1.5.2. Ensure back-ups assigned in order to keep process moving.
     1.5.3. Retrieve monthly bills on-line or through email when possible, rather than regular
     mail.
     1.5.4. Primary focus on ―
                             Mega bills‖ rather than small dollar invoices.
     1.5.5. Negotiate with utility companies for agreement to not charge late fees
     (demonstrate good faith by paying bill on time).
     1.5.6. Establish a strong working relationship with the base utility engineer, base
     comptroller, DFAS and the utility company – know who your contacts are.
     1.5.7. Establish a metric to track occurrence of late payments.
  1.6. Results Measurement:
     1.6.1. Each base will track on a monthly basis the amount of late fees charged and paid
     and the amount of interest penalties accrued relating to utility bill payments.
     1.6.2. HQ AFMC/A7R will request data from bases concerning late fee payments and
     interest penalty payments relating to utility bill payments on a quarterly basis.
  1.7. Responsibilities:
     1.7.1. Headquarters AFMC.
     1.7.2. HQ AFMC/A7R will track progress of each base and report quarterly as
     determined appropriate.
     1.7.3. HQ AFMC/A7R will post any lessons learned provided by bases for other bases to
     review.
  1.8. Bases:
     1.8.1. Base Civil Engineers (BCE) will ensure utility bill paying process and best
     practices are instituted at their base; proper oversight is implemented; corrective action is
     taken when needed.
     1.8.2. Resource Advisors (RAs)/Budget Analyst responsible for utility bill payments will
     implement the bill paying process (see paragraph 1.4.) and institute best practices (see
     paragraph 1.5.).
         1.8.2.1. RAs/Budget Analyst will track on a monthly basis all late fee payments and
         interest penalty payments related to utilities.
         1.8.2.2. RAs/Budget Analyst will brief BCE monthly on the amount of late fees and
         interest penalty payments relating to utilities.
         1.8.2.3. RAs/Budget Analyst will research cause for any late fee and implement
         corrective action to eliminate additional late fees. RA/Budget Analyst will provide
         AFMC/A7R the following information concerning the late fee: who caused it, what
         caused it, when it happened, which commodity it was against and why it happened.
4                                                              AFMCI65-700 11 JULY 2009


          RA/Budget Analyst will also include the lesson learned, if any, and what the solution
          was to prevent a reoccurrence.
