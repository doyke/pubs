                                           Chapter 1

                                ACTIVE DUTY SANCTUARY

1.1. Purpose: Title 10 United States Code (USC), § 12686(a) and 12646(e) establish an active
duty (AD) retirement sanctuary for members of all Air Reserve Components (ARCs). ―Under
regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary concerned, which shall be as uniform as practicable,
a member of a Reserve component who is on AD (other than for training), and is within two
years of becoming eligible for retired pay or retainer pay under a purely military retirement
system…may not be involuntarily released from that duty before he becomes eligible for that
pay, unless release is approved by the Secretary‖ (Title 10 USC § 12686(a)). In general, AD
sanctuary means any Air National Guard (ANG)/United States Air Force Reserve (USAFR)
officer/enlisted member who attains 18 (but less than 20) years of AD must be retained on AD
unless he/she: voluntarily separates; is medically disqualified for continued service; or is
separated or discharged for cause. Additionally, all AD served ―counts‖ for the computation of
the 18 years of Total Active Federal Military Service (TAFMS) required toward reaching the
sanctuary zone. Note: Reserve sanctuary statutes are addressed separately in Chapter 5 of this
document.
1.2. Definition: AD sanctuary protection begins with 18 years of TAFMS and ends with 20
years of TAFMS. It provides a member with a limited entitlement to remain on AD for the
purpose of qualifying for an AD military retirement. Additionally, it protects the Air Force from
unexpected costs, ensures control on pay, entitlements, end strength, grade, and AFSC
distribution. The sanctuary statute does not deny anyone their entitlement to a 20 year
retirement; members may continue to accrue AD points while performing any voluntary tour of
AD with a signed/approved waiver in place.
1.3. Guidance. A member desiring to invoke sanctuary protection under Title 10 USC §
12686(a) must claim such protection while on AD (other than for training) and while in the
sanctuary zone. The request must be in writing (attachment 5,6,7, 8 and 10 as applicable) and
submitted to the respective NAF/RMG/CC or NGB/A1 (or State JFHQs as applicable) for
processing. Requests from USAFR Joint Service unit members should be forwarded by their
servicing personnel section directly to AFRC/A1RY for consideration by AFRC/CV. Absent a
written claim for sanctuary zone protection, the service will consider the member’s release from
AD as voluntary and sanctuary protection will be deemed not properly requested.
AFI36-2131 27 JULY 2011                                                                        5


                                          Chapter 2

                   MANAGEMENT OF ACTIVE DUTY SANCTUARY

2.1. Management. The Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) requires the ARC to manage the
two-year window of potential sanctuary eligibles.Additionally, by HQ Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC)/CV delegation; NAF/Wing/CCs and Readiness Management Group
(RMG)/CC will maintain overall responsibility for administration of the sanctuary program for
USAF Reservists. For ANG members, NGB/A1, State Joint Forces Headquarters (JFHQs),
Force Support Squadrons/Flights and commanders will maintain overall responsibility for the
sanctuary program of their Guardsmen. In order to meet this requirement, the following process
is in place for all ARCs, with indications of variances shown as applicable.
   2.1.1. For USAFR: AFRC/A1RI will produce a monthly report/roster containing a list of
   personnel who are in or nearing AD sanctuary (members who have accumulated 16 ½ yrs,
   but less than 20 years TAFMS). The report/roster will contain the names of members, the
   type of tour, and amount of current TAFMS. The updated sanctuary products will be made
   available on the A1RY Plans, Programs and Entitlements Community of Practice (CoP):
   [https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx? Filter=RC-DP-00-01]. This
   report/roster will be monitored by Program Managers for all IMAs, Units for TRs and the Air
   Reserve Personnel Center (ARPC)/DPASO for Mobilization Assistants (MAs).
   Additionally, FSS/PM responsibilities are to maintain the report or roster, provide the roster
   to all agencies concerned on a ―need to know‖ basis, and monitor members with a pending
   LOD/MEB issue. Review sanctuary eligibility when placing new accessions on any type of
   AD tour. There may be a time delay between accession and gain to the Point Credit
   Accounting and Reporting System (PCARS) from which the information is taken for tracking
   the TAFMS.
       2.1.1.1. Air Reserve Orders Writing System (AROWS-R) has been modified to identify
       members who are in or nearing AD sanctuary zone, alerting the Wing Commander,
       RMG/CC, or ARPC that a waiver is required before approving the tour of voluntary AD.
       Note: The following statement is mandatory on each AD order (based on the receipt of a
       sanctuary waiver from the member): ―The member has waived the sanctuary protection
       of Title 10 U.S.C. § 12686(a) for the period of AD authorized by this order.‖
   2.1.2. For ANG: ANG Force Support Squadrons/Flights (FSS/FSF) and State Joint Forces
   Headquarters (JFHQ) are responsible for producing monthly reports to monitor sanctuary
   eligibility.
       2.1.2.1. The Air National Guard Reserve Order Writing System (AROWS) will flag (via
       ―hardhold‖) any order that will bring a Title 32 (T32) ANG unit member beyond 16 years
       of TAFMS to ensure that the total years of AD service are verified prior to the order
       being approved. If the order publication is for a period of less than 180 days and brings
       the member into AD sanctuary, the member must complete and sign the waiver to AD
       sanctuary (attachment 4) prior to the order being approved. This is applicable to those
       members serving on voluntary Title 10 USC § 12301(d) or T32 Active Duty for
       Operational Support (ADOS) days.
 6                                                                  AFI36-2131 27 JULY 2011


        2.1.2.2. Those members placed on T32 Special Training (ST) orders that are doing T32
        operational support (not actual training) and whose ST order brings them into AD
        sanctuary, must follow the same procedures for completing an AD sanctuary waiver prior
        to orders being approved. The following statement is mandatory (based on the receipt of
        a sanctuary waiver from the member) on each AD order: ―The member has waived the
        sanctuary protection of Title 10 U.S.C. § 12686(a) for the period of AD authorized by
        this order.‖ Those involuntarily activated have the right to invoke AD sanctuary and be
        assessed into the active component Air Force.
2.2. Air Reserve Component Manday Definitions. Air Reserve Component members
performing Active Duty for Operational Support (ADOS), Reserve Personnel
Appropriation (RPA), Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA), Active Duty for Training
(ADT), and ANG Special Training (ST). Any ARC member performing ADOS (T10 or T32),
RPA, MPA or applicable ST tours specifying 180 days or less for which the period of AD would
result in the member qualifying for AD sanctuary, may not begin the tour without an approved
waiver in place prior to the tour start date. Any error or breach of policy, with regard to
sanctuary waivers, is avoided if the member (who is in or whose upcoming tour would place
them in the sanctuary zone) has a signed/approved waiver in place prior to the tour start date for
any voluntary tours of active duty. See Attachments 3 and 4 for applicable waiver templates for
voluntary tours. Although a member has a signed/approved waiver in place, he/she will continue
to accumulate active duty points during the waiver period which could eventually lead to an
active duty retirement. Waiver requirements do not apply to members performing IDT, ADT or
are activated under involuntary authorities under Title 10 USC §12301(a), 12302, or 12304. See
chapter 4 for additional information regarding involuntary activation and sanctuary eligibility.
Note: When supporting regular Air Force missions, ARC members are placed on an MPA tour.
When supporting ARC missions, ARC members are placed on an RPA/ADOS (T32 for ANG)
tour.
     2.2.1. Reserve Personnel Appropriation (RPA): RPA tours fall into two categories;
     Active Duty for Operational Support (RPA/ADOS) and Active Duty for Training
     (RPA/ADT).
        2.2.1.1. Active Duty for Operational Support (ADOS) (formerly known as Active
        Duty for Special Work [ADSW]; however AROWS-R still reflects ADSW as tour
        type): RPA/ADOS is considered voluntary AD. IAW Title 10 USC § 12686(b), if the
        period of ADOS specifying less than 180 days will result in the member qualifying for
        AD sanctuary, a signed/approved waiver must be completed prior to the tour start date.
        The waiver requirement must be coordinated between the using organization and the
        organization of assignment, when applicable. Members will not be able to commence the
        tour without an approved waiver prior to tour start date. ANG T32 ADOS tours are also
        subject to AD sanctuary waiver rules.
        2.2.1.2. Active Duty for Training (ADT): Members performing RPA/ADT tours are
        not eligible to claim sanctuary protection. For USAFR: See AFI 36-2254, Volume I,
        Reserve Personnel Participation for definitions of training categories. For ANG: See
        ANGI 36-2001, Management of Training and Operational Support within the Air
        National Guard, for definitions of training categories.
AFI36-2131 27 JULY 2011                                                                         7


   2.2.2. Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA) [defined by AFI 36-2619, Military
   Personnel Appropriation Man-Day Program]: If an ARC member performs a MPA tour
   of less than 180 days, and the period of AD would result in the member qualifying for AD
   sanctuary, the member may not begin the tour without an approved waiver in place prior to
   the tour start date. The need for a waiver must be coordinated between the using
   organization and the unit of assignment if applicable.
   2.2.3. Special Training (ST): For ANG members placed on T32 Special Training (ST)
   orders performing T32 operational support (not actual training) and the applicable ST order
   brings the member into AD sanctuary, the same sanctuary procedures must be followed for
   completing the AD sanctuary waiver prior to orders being approved and published.
2.3. Sanctuary Policy: Current policy and law requires an ARC member who is in the
sanctuary zone, or would be based upon publication of an order to active duty under a MPA,
RPA/ADOS, T32 ADOS or applicable T32 ST tour specifying a period of duty of less than 180
days must have a signed/approved waiver of sanctuary protection (attachment 3 or 4) prior to
order being issued. This requirement exists for any voluntary tour of less than 180 days until the
member is through the sanctuary zone. Mobilization policy is a separate issue (see chapter 4).
Although a member has a signed/approved waiver in place, he/she will continue to accumulate
active duty points during the waiver period which could eventually lead to an active duty
retirement. In the event a member is placed in a voluntary order status (MPA, RPA/ADOS, T32
ADOS or T32 ST Tour) without executing a sanctuary waiver and declines to separate
voluntarily from the AD tour or is not medically disqualified, separated or discharged for cause
and elects to invoke sanctuary protection, the following procedures are required:
   2.3.1. For USAFR: Members are accessed into the AFR Active Guard/Reserve Program.
   The documents at attachment 5 will be completed and forwarded to AFRC/A1RY for
   processing for placement. AGR end-strength is congressionally mandated and request for
   exceptions will not be addressed for these situations. The member will be assigned to a
   position based on the needs of the AFR and such assignment terminates upon the member
   reaching eligibility for an immediate AD retirement.
   2.3.2. For ANG: The State is required to provide full-time military employment, utilizing
   the current authorized AGR resources. Attachment 6 will be completed by the member with
   assistance of the unit and submitted to the State for placement. NGB/A1 will not provide the
   State additional AGR resources for these situations. Any such assignment will terminate
   upon member reaching eligibility for an immediate retirement.
2.4. Continuation for Medical Evaluation: The ability to recall or continue a Reserve
Component (RC) member for medical evaluation under Title 10 USC § 12301(h) is independent
from the member’s sanctuary right under Title 10 USC § 12686.
   2.4.1. If a RC member is placed on Title 10 USC § 12301(h) orders and has 18 but less than
   20 years of active duty service, the member is requested to process a sanctuary waiver while
   under medical treatment (attachment 3 or 4 as applicable).
8                                                                   AFI36-2131 27 JULY 2011


    2.4.2. If the continued medical care or recall for medical evaluation occurs during the period
    of an already established sanctuary waiver period, the member is not required to process
    another sanctuary waiver unless the Title 10 USC § 12301(h) orders will take the member
    beyond the previously established waiver period. If the continued medical care or recall for
    medical evaluation occurs during the period of the waiver, the member may not claim
    sanctuary.
       2.4.2.1. If the medical evaluation finds the member medically unfit for duty he/she
       would be processed for a medical evaluation board review under Reserve regulations and
       the authority of the Secretary. If the member is not medically disqualified and does not
       have a waiver in place, he/she would continue on AD under the terms of the 12301(h)
       AD order.
AFI36-2131 27 JULY 2011                                                                        9


                                           Chapter 3

                 PROCESSING ACTIVE DUTY SANCTUARY WAIVERS

3.1. Requirement: Members who are in or whose upcoming tour would qualify them for
sanctuary protection must affirmatively waive the applicability of Title 10 USC § 12686(a) in
order to perform any voluntary tour of AD (other than training) of less than 180 days. Waivers
must be submitted prior to publication of any order (other than training) specifying a period of
less than 180 days performed under Title 10 USC § 12301(d). Additionally, if any published
order (other than training) of less than 180 days, currently covered by a waiver, is extended; an
additional waiver for the period of the extension is required before the amendment can be
published. The member will continue to accumulate points during the waiver period. ANG
Members entering sanctuary zone will not be provided orders under Title 10 USC § 12301(d) in
excess of 179 days. While waivers are not required from members involuntarily mobilized
under Title 10 USC § 12301(a), 12302 or 12304 or for published orders under Title 10 USC §
12301(d) specifying periods in excess of 179 days; such action shall be evaluated by the unit
commander with coordination of appropriate MAJCOM functional manager to ensure
maintainability of active component Force Management actions.
   3.1.1. Prior to performing a voluntary tour that may result in eligibility for sanctuary, ARC
   members must submit a Statement of Understanding (USAFR attachment 3, ANG attachment
   4) to their Commander, servicing FSS or Program Manager (PM). The waiver must
   accompany the AD tour request, or the tour will not be approved and orders will not be
   published. Any extension of AD cannot commence without an additional waiver for the
   period of the tour extension. ARC members must ensure AD tour requests accompanied by
   the waiver, are received NLT 45 calendar days before tour start date, unless extreme
   circumstances preclude compliance. The approval authority may require justification for a

                                           Chapter 5

                                   RESERVE SANCTUARY

5.1. General Guidance: Reserve sanctuary under Title 10 USC § 1176 (b) (enlisted), 12646(a)
and (b) (officer) is provided for Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard members serving in
an active Reserve status who have completed at least 18, but fewer than 20 years of satisfactory
service.
5.2. Enlisted Eligibility: Reserve members in an active status who are selected to be
involuntarily separated (other than for physical disability or for cause), or whose term of
enlistment expires and who are denied reenlistment (other than for physical disability or for
cause), and who on the date on which the member is to be discharged or transferred from an
active status are entitled to be credited with at least 18, but less than 20 years of service
computed under Title 10 USC § 12732, may not be discharged, denied reenlistment, or
transferred from an active status without the member’s consent.
   5.2.1. Extension of ETS:
       5.2.1.1. For USAFR: Members denied reenlistment who require an extension of ETS to
       obtain 20 years of satisfactory service must go through their servicing Force Support
       Squadron (FSS) . The member and or Force Support Squadron must obtain coordination
       with RMG/DP (IR & PIRR only), AFRC/A1KP (TRs and ARTs only), or AFRC/A1A
       (AGRs only).
       5.2.1.2. For ANG: A member who will not be qualified for retirement upon reaching
       age 60, but will qualify before attaining age 62, and is otherwise qualified for retention,
       may be extended to qualify for retirement under the provisions of Title 10 USC § 1176
       (b). This provision only applies when a waiver for retention beyond age 60, IAW ANGI
       36-2002, Enlistment and Reenlistment in the Air National Guard and as a Reserve of the
       Air Force, was granted by ANG at the time of enlistment. This type of extension request
       will be forwarded by the State to NGB/A1PO for final action.
5.3. Enlisted Ineligibility: Enlisted members in an active status selected to be involuntarily
separated for physical disability, for cause, or denied reenlistment for physical disability or for
cause; are not eligible for Reserve sanctuary under Title 10 USC § 1176(b).
5.4. Officer Eligibility: Title 10 USC § 12646 allows officers within the age limitations, and
physical qualifications, and otherwise eligible for continued service to be eligible for Reserve
sanctuary, if they have completed 18, but less than 20 years of satisfactory service, and are
otherwise eligible for Reserve retirement.
   5.4.1. ARPC/DPTTS will adjust, as permitted by Title 10 USC § 12646(a) or (b), and
   individual’s MSD if attained prior to reaching 20 years satisfactory service.
       5.4.1.1. If the member has 18 years satisfactory service upon expiration of MSD, their
       MSD will be extended by three years;
       5.4.1.2. If the member has 19 years satisfactory service when MSD expires, they will be
       extended for two years.
AFI36-2131 27 JULY 2011                                                                          13


   5.4.2. Individual Ready Reserve (S7) members are placed into a Reserve sanctuary unit,
   while unit and IMA members continue service with their assigned organization.
5.5. Officer Ineligibility: Officers who are discharged or transferred from an active status for
physical disability, for cause, or because they have reached the age at which transfer from an
active status or discharge is required by law, are not eligible for Reserve sanctuary under Title 10
USC § 12646.
5.6. Member Status. A member of the Selected Reserve (SELRES) in Reserve sanctuary
remains in the SELRES and is not transferred to the Non-Affiliated Reserve Section
(NARS)/NC. These members will continue to participate and earn points with their unit and may
also earn points through extension courses. Non-participating IRR members are transferred to
NARS/NC and may earn points through ECI courses to obtain 20 years of satisfactory service.
ARPC/DPTSPR will assist members assigned to NARS/NC in finding a point only training
attachment. Members remain in Reserve sanctuary until obtaining 20 years of satisfactory
service or until the second or third anniversary, as appropriate under Title 10 USC § 12646, of
the date on which the member would otherwise have been discharged or transferred from an
active status.
5.7. ARPC Responsibilities. ARPC/DPTTS generates a monthly report from MilPDS
identifying reservists (commissioned officer and enlisted members) retained in sanctuary. It is
used to monitor members’ participation and ensure retirement or separation at members’ adjusted
MSD (officer), HYTD (enlisted) or ETS (enlisted members denied reenlistment).
   5.7.1. If the report reflects that a member currently has 19 or more years of satisfactory
   service, ARPC/DPPRS closely monitors points earned during current Retention/Retirement
   year. Members attaining 20 years of satisfactory service are automatically transferred to the
   Retired Reserve unless a request for resignation is received NLT 30 calendar days prior to
   MSD; or the member is in ART status covered under Title 10 USC § 10216(f).
5.8. Pre-Separation Counseling: A member in Reserve sanctuary shall receive pre-separation
counseling as required by Title 10 USC § 1142.

                           Waiver of Active Duty (AD) Sanctuary
                   (Unit /Individual Reservist/Mobilization Assistant (MA))

1. I understand under the sanctuary protection provided to me by Title 10, USC § 12686(a), if I
serve the period of AD which is the subject of this waiver (from (DATE) to (DATE), I will then
be serving on AD within 2 years of becoming eligible for retired pay under the military
retirement system. After I enter that 2-year sanctuary, I cannot be involuntarily released from
AD, without approval by the SECAF, before I become eligible for retired pay.
2. I understand that in order for me to serve on AD during the period specified above, which
would bring me within the sanctuary protection, the SAF requires that I must waive my right to
sanctuary protection, IAW 10 USC § 12686(b).
3. This waiver, shown by my signature below, means I will not receive sanctuary protection.
Therefore, I may be released from AD without SAF approval even though serving on AD within
two years of becoming eligible for retired pay.
4. I also understand neither my waiver nor any order request submitted requiring me to perform
further voluntary AD service is effective until this waiver is acknowledged and tour approved by
NAF/CC (unit), RMG/CC (for individual reservists (IR)), AFRC/CV (AFRC unit member of
United States Joint Forces), or ARPC/CC (MAs), or designated representative.

I, _ (Typed Rank, Name, and last 4 of SSN) voluntarily waive my right to invoke sanctuary
protection as provided under AFI 36-2131 and 10 USC § 12686(b).
(Please initial)
_____ I have read the above explanation and have been fully counseled on the impact it has on
my participation.

_____ I understand that by waiving my right to claim sanctuary I am allowed to perform a
voluntary tour of duty of less than 180 days (number of days shown on the military orders to
which this waiver relates, cannot be altered upward or that tour extended, by amendment or
otherwise without an additional waiver being executed for the time-period of the requested
extension).

_____ I understand that while performing the approved tour I may not claim sanctuary. I further
understand should I attempt to claim sanctuary while performing this tour of duty, my orders will
be immediately terminated with no authorization for sanctuary claim due to breach of contract.

_____ I understand that for each type of AD tour or extension thereof that I request, except ADT,
a new waiver will be required and accomplished.

 _____ I understand that my AD tour will not begin until I have proper acknowledgement/
approval from the SAF or designee of this waiver.
AFI36-2131 27 JULY 2011                                                                          19


______ I understand that I will continue to accrue active duty points while performing this tour
with a waiver in place. Upon accumulation of approximately 7305 active duty points, I will have
earned an AD retirement and may retire immediately with an AD annuity, or continue to
participate for additional points and pay.

______ I understand this sanctuary waiver is irrevocable for the voluntary period of active duty
for which the waiver has been executed as described in paragraph 1 above.

_____ I understand that this written document will be filed at the FSS and electronically at
NAF/CC (unit), RMG/CC (IR), AFRC/A1R (unit Joint Forces members), or ARPC/CC (MA) as
evidence that I have waived my right to sanctuary protection.

1. I understand that under the sanctuary protection provided to me by Title 10 USC §12686(a), if

2. I understand that in order for me to serve on AD during the period specified above, which
would bring me within the sanctuary protection, the SAF requires that I must waive my right to
sanctuary protection, IAW 10 USC § 12686(b).
3. This waiver, shown by my signature below, means I will not receive sanctuary protection.
Therefore, I may be released from AD without SAF approval even though serving on AD within
two years of becoming eligible for retired pay.
4. I also understand no order request submitted requiring me to perform further voluntary AD
service is effective until this waiver is acknowledged and tour approved by TAG or designee.
I, (Typed, Rank, Name, and last 4 of SSN), voluntarily waive my right to invoke sanctuary
protection as provided under AFI 36-2131 and Title 10, USC §12686(b).
(Please initial)
_____ I have read the above explanation and have been fully counseled on the impact that it has
on my participation.
_____ I understand that by waiving my right to claim sanctuary I am allowed to perform a
voluntary T32 ADOS, ST or T10 MPA tour of less than 180 days (number of days shown on the
military orders to which this waiver relates, cannot be altered upward or that tour extended, by
amendment or otherwise without an additional waiver being executed for the time-period of the
requested extension).
_____ I understand that while performing the approved tour I may not claim sanctuary. I further
understand should I attempt to claim sanctuary while performing this tour of duty, my orders will
be immediately terminated with no authorization for sanctuary claim due to breach of contract.
_____ I understand that for each type of AD tour or extension thereof that I request, except ADT,
a new waiver will be required and accomplished.
_____ I understand that my AD tour will not begin until I have proper approval from TAG or
designee.
______ I understand that I will continue to accrue active duty points while performing this tour
with a waiver in place; upon accumulation of approximately 7305 active duty points, I will have
earned an AD retirement and may retire immediately with an AD annuity, or continue to
participate for additional points and pay.
______ I understand this sanctuary waiver is irrevocable for the voluntary period of active duty
for which the waiver has been requested.

______ I understand that this written document will be filed at my State Joint Forces
Headquarters, FSS/FSF and my unit as evidence that I have waived my right to sanctuary
protection.
