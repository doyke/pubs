6. IFE/GE Procedures: MDS specific tech data will be used for IFE/GE purposes.                    The
following is a general outline of procedures.
     6.1. R&R South will provide coverage for all fighter aircraft and R&R North will provide
     coverage for all heavy aircraft on Kadena AB. When either side requires assistance from the
     other a call will be made to the EMS Production Super to make the request.
     6.2. Upon notification of an IFE/GE, R&R North/South response will be limited to the
     primary crash vehicle and tow vehicle with tow bar. There will be a minimum of three
     qualified personnel, one of which will be a fully qualified 7-level. This does not limit the
     number of personnel to three but should be kept to only those necessary for the recovery.
     6.3. The CRT will coordinate with Chief 2/IC on TAC-1 to determine a rendezvous location.
     Once notification is received that the emergency aircraft is on the ground, crash recovery
     vehicles will remain behind all Fire Department vehicles.
     6.4. Once the aircraft has been declared fire safe by IC, the CRT will approach the aircraft.
     If the aircraft is disabled on the runway and unable to move under its’ own power, the CRT
     will remove the aircraft from the runway. If aircraft can be towed under normal
     circumstances, the owning AMU will be responsible for towing the aircraft back to the
     designated parking spot after the CRT removes it from the runway.
     6.5. The CRT will respond to all GE’s in the same manner as an IFE and stand by until
     released by Chief 2.
     6.6. TA will provide initial response during non-normal duty hours. They will also assist
     with responding to transient aircraft.
7. Hot Brakes Procedures: MDS specific tech data will be used for hot brake purposes. The
following is a general outline of procedures.
     7.1. There are no mechanical means to determine if an aircraft has hot brakes (TO 4B-1-1,
     Use of Landing Wheel Brakes and Wheels during Ground Operations) therefore hot brakes
     can only be declared by the aircraft commander (AC), Fire Emergency Services (FES), or
     CRT personnel.
     7.2. IAW TO 4B-1-1, a hot brake condition exists if any of the following condition are
     present: Aircrew has reported possible hot brakes, wheel thermal plugs have melted, a visible
     fire has been observed, wheel drive keys are glowing red or white, the axle over temperature
     indicator (if equipped) has extended, or the reading from an IR heat gun indicates an over
     temperature condition. Upon notification/verification of suspected hot brakes:
        7.2.1. If the aircraft is on rollout, the tower will direct the aircraft to taxi to the nearest
        hot brake area IAW Kadena AB Instruction 13-204, Airfield Operations Instruction. If
        the aircraft is already at End of Runway (EOR), the aircraft will remain in position IAW
        TO 4B-1-1, Use of Landing Wheel Brakes and Wheels During Ground Operations, and
        personnel will evacuate the area.
        7.2.2. If hot brakes are suspected, the brakes will not be checked until 10 - 15 minutes
        have passed since the last application of brakes due to heat transfer from the brakes to the
        wheel assemblies.
18WGI21-103 23 OCTOBER 2014                                                                     9


      7.2.3. FES or Crash Recovery personnel will chock the aircraft. Personnel will approach
      an aircraft with suspected hot brakes from a forward or aft direction. FES personnel will
      check brake temperatures with an IR heat gun to establish a baseline temperature. After
      consulting with CRT and determining brakes have dropped below acceptable levels IAW
      the TO, CRT personnel will conduct a check of the aircraft brakes for excessive heat and
      ensure the aircraft is safe to taxi. Fighter aircraft engines will not be shut down unless
      directed by the IC.
      7.2.4. If the pilot, FES, or CRT personnel declare hot brakes, the aircraft will remain in
      the designated area for a minimum of 30 minutes to allow adequate cool-down time IAW
      TO 4B-1-1, Use of Landing Wheel Brakes and Wheels During Ground Operations. All
      personnel will stay clear of an area extending 300 feet in a 45 degree angle on both sides
      of the wheel until the brakes have cooled or the thermal release plugs have deflated the
      tires.
      7.2.5. The SFO will direct a fire vehicle to remain with the aircraft for the allotted cool-
      down time. Once the allotted cool-down time has expired, FES will check brake
      temperatures and compare them to the TO with CRT personnel.
      7.2.6. Aircraft may taxi back to the designated parking area after the allotted cool-down
      time and after brake temperatures have dropped to accepted levels.
   7.3. Host unit C-130, E-3, KC-135 and HH-60 personnel will tow their aircraft to the
   designated parking spot after the allotted cool-down period if engines are shut down. Heavy
   aircraft may shut down for evacuation purposes. Crash Recovery will not be responsible for
   towing aircraft once removed from active runway/taxiway and IFE/GE has been terminated
   by the SFO.
   7.4. The CRT will tow all other aircraft back to its designated parking spot if engines are
   shut down after the allotted cool-down period. If another ground or in-flight emergency
   takes place the owning unit will tow their aircraft back to the parking location.
8. Barrier Engagements: MDS specific tech data will be used for barrier engagement
purposes. The following is a general outline of procedures.
   8.1. FES personnel will ensure the aircraft is fire safe and chocked. The IC will then turn
   control of the aircraft over to the CRT supervisor for barrier extraction.
   8.2. IAW AFI 32-1043, Managing, Operating, and Maintaining Aircraft Arresting Systems,
   alternate extraction procedures are commonly referred to as “slingshotting” the aircraft.
   Potential for aircraft damage is high when using these methods; therefore, use these
   procedures only during contingencies or in-flight emergencies that require rapid removal of
   an aircraft from a cable. This procedure must be approved by the installation commander
   before being used for routine disengagement of aircraft during local exercises or scheduled
   testing of the arresting system (e.g., certification).
   8.3. The CRT will safe the aircraft, shut down engines, and tow the aircraft clear of the
   barrier, as required. In the event CRT personnel are not available, or there is an imminent
   danger to the pilot (i.e. smoke in the cockpit, aircraft fire, etc.), FES will safe the landing
   gear and direct the AC to shut down engines.

   8.4. The CRT will safe, at a minimum, the aircraft landing gear and all live forward firing
   ordnances prior to towing the aircraft off the runway. Immediately upon exiting the active
   runway, the tow team will stop the aircraft and all remaining safing operations will be
   completed prior to towing the aircraft to its designated parking spot.
9. CDDAR Vehicle and Equipment Requirements. R&R North/South section will be
equipped with a crash hotline and base station radio for monitoring the crash dispatch net.
   9.1. The following vehicles are required for IFE response and crash recovery capability.
      9.1.1. 2 each unit assigned (1 for R&R North, 1 for R&R South), 6-passenger, 1-ton, 4x4
      pickups with heavy duty pintle-hook and utility body (or equivalent) for storage and
      security of all tools and crash equipment. 2 each unit assigned (1 for R&R North, 1 for
      R&R South), 6-passenger, 1-ton, 4x2 pickups with heavy duty pintle-hook and utility
      body (or equivalent). Vehicles will be equipped with emergency lights, siren, radio
      (capable of monitoring all maintenance nets to include the Secondary Crash Net
      independently), TOs, tools, and safety equipment to perform immediate response
      operations.
          9.1.1.1. Crash recovery emergency response vehicles will be inspected daily by the
          on-coming shift for verification of response capability and documented on the
          vehicle’s inspection form.
      9.1.2. Semi-tractor truck and 40-foot flatbed trailer maintained/operated by 18 LRS to
      facilitate aircraft removal as determined by CDDAR Team Chief.
      9.1.3. Unit assigned aircraft tow tractor (MB-2 or MB-4) maintained by 18 LRS/LGRV
