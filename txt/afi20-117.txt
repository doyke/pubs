1.1. Scope. This publication provides responsibilities and direction for the implementation and
management of an optimized Total Force (Regular Air Force (RegAF), Guard, and Reserve)
Repair Network. The Repair Network will accomplish intermediate-level maintenance of aircraft
and reparable assets required to fulfill operational needs outside the capability and/or capacity of
the Mission Generation Network (MGN).
1.2. General. Repair Network Management is a process-focused effort designed to standardize
work and reduce waste and costs of organizational and intermediate-level maintenance through
comprehensive management at an AF Enterprise-level, with an ultimate goal of delivering
optimized weapons system availability. Enterprise management examines the core processes that
impact weapon system availability including product flow, funding, requirements, RNI
capability and capacity (CAP2), and information technology. This concept provides a single
process owner for the Air Force Repair Enterprise including planning, operations, and strategy.
RNI management processes do not change or realign chain-of-command relationships, and repair
nodes will continue to report through their chain-of-command.
1.3. RNI Objectives. RNI objectives are multi-faceted and include:
   1.3.1. Transforming and sustaining maintenance management processes to establish a Repair
   Network that improves efficiency and responsiveness to warfighter requirements.
   1.3.2. Managing the Repair Network to perform intermediate-level maintenance activities

   reparables (DLRs), and modifications.
   1.3.3. Facilitating effective collaboration of repair management between distributed repair
   nodes in the Repair Network, including Centralized Repair Facilities (CRF), wing-level
   intermediate-level maintenance support shops, and contract maintenance sites.
   1.3.4. Enhancing Repair Network management and providing improved feedback to the
   MGN through the utilization of integrated, bandwidth efficient, logistics information systems
   to ensure a seamless flow of logistics management and business data.
   1.3.5. Incorporating Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) to seek out efficiency and
   effectiveness gains throughout the Repair Network.
   1.3.6. Incorporating the Repair Network into the Supply Chain and improving the efficiency
   of Supply Chain Management processes supporting the MGN.
1.4. Repair Network Exclusions. RNI excludes the following activities/assets:
   1.4.1. Maintenance activities on non-aircraft systems, non-aircraft support equipment, or
   non-aircraft communications equipment.          Note: Precision Measurement Equipment
   Laboratories (PMEL) activities/assets are included in RNI.

                           CORE MANAGEMENT PROCESSES

3.1. General. This chapter describes the Core Management Process (refer to AFMAN 20-118,
when published, for detailed processes and procedures). The Repair Network shall use the eight
strategic and operational core management processes to develop standard tools and repeatable
processes for decision-making and network operation. These processes serve as the backbone of
the Repair Network Management concept.
3.2. Strategic Processes. Strategic Processes have a cycle time of 13 months or more and
include long-range planning activities performed by AFMC/A4 in collaboration with MAJCOM
/ANG A4s. Strategic Planning activities will follow guidance in AFPD 90-11, Strategic Planning
System, to include proper coordination with the Agile Combat Support (ACS) Core Function
Lead (CFL) and other CFLs as necessary. The four network Management Strategic Processes
include:
   3.2.1. Strategic Planning. This aspect focuses on alignment of Repair Enterprise strategic
   goals and objectives with the AFCS, and CFL/MAJCOM/ANG Strategic Plans. Strategic
   planning shall provide strategic goals, guidance, and objectives to influence the Air Force
   and CFL/MAJCOM/ANG PPB&E process and acquisition programs to ensure a responsive,
   right-sized, Air Force Repair Enterprise that meets statutory requirements.
   3.2.2. Programming and Financial Management. This focuses on leveraging appropriate
   budgeting processes and developing and/or describing future processes that support end-state
   repair network capabilities and conformance with regulatory and fiscal guidance. The scope
   includes all funding sources that finance operations of the repair network at all locations
   (organic and inter-service) and at all levels. It covers processes for all affected
   appropriations, including Military Personnel (MILPERS), Military Personnel Appropriation
   (MPA) Man-days, and transportation costs. Using the POM process and previously
   determined RNI goals and objectives from the ACS Core Function Support Plan (CFSP) as
   inputs for this step, AFMC/A4 is responsible for programming for RNI Infrastructure
   Planning goals and objectives (see AFMAN 20-118, when published). When a work request
   will be made to a different component, another Service, or an organization funded by a
   separate appropriation, steps must be taken to ensure that all labor and other costs are paid by
   the correct appropriation in order to avoid augmentation, deficiency issues, and purpose
   violations. AFI 65-601, Vol 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, and DoD 7000.14-R,
   Department of Defense Financial Management Regulation (DoD FMR), should be
   referenced, and a legal review conducted, if necessary. Prior to implementation of any action
   involving the ANG, consolidation reporting of 2009 National Defense Authorization Act
   (NDAA) requirements with supporting analysis, studies, financial assessments, and legal
   reviews must be considered.
   3.2.3. Shape and Size Network. The goal of this core management process is to right-size the
   Air Force repair enterprise based on appropriate business cost comparisons, risk analysis, and
   war requirements. The repair enterprise shall ensure the Air Force maintains the optimal
   amount of daily and peak repair CAP2 to meet current and future needs of the Air Force,
AFI20-117 10 DECEMBER 2014                                                                     13


   joint, foreign, and civilian partners. MAJCOM/ANG collaboration is required during the
   development of recommendations to ensure compliance with applicable instructions.
   3.2.4. Workforce and Infrastructure Planning. The goal of workforce and infrastructure
   planning is to evaluate current workforce and infrastructure availability against repair
   requirements and develop/redesign strategic workforce and infrastructure requirements for
   enterprise repair. The output will be long-range workforce and infrastructure plans that
   satisfy repair enterprise Shaping and Sizing recommendations. This process should be
   conducted in parallel with Programming and Financial Management. Strategic workforce
   plans must be coordinated with appropriate MAJCOM A1 offices to ensure
   adherence/consideration to manpower policy and appropriate UMD updates are completed.
3.3. Operational Processes. Operational processes have a cycle time of 12 months or less, and
can be measured in intervals as short as weeks or days. These processes are short-range,
execution-year activities performed by the RNM and NM in collaboration with network
stakeholders. The four operational processes include:
   3.3.1. Aggregate & Prioritize Requirements. The RNM will receive repair requirements from
   the applicable system of record/data storage (e.g., Automated Budget Control System,
   D200A Requirements Determination System, and/or Integrated Maintenance Data
   System/GO81).
   3.3.2. Compute RNI CAP2. This process provides the ability to baseline node CAP2 and
   aggregate all node data to determine network RNI CAP2. NMs are responsible for
   establishing baseline CAP2 data and providing updates as required by the RNM.
   3.3.3. Plan and Allocate Workload. This core process converts validated repair requirements
   into maintenance workload and allocates it across the Repair Network. This process allows
   for workload allocation in the execution year and re-planning work based on changing
   requirements throughout the year. Requirements and RNI CAP2 data are validated and
   workload is appropriately allocated to repair nodes based on node RNI CAP2. The annual
   workload plan, coordinated through the governance structure and approved by each affected
   MAJCOM/ANG, is provided to the repair nodes for production planning. Funds holder and
   the appropriate level of FM coordination are required when plans include moving workload
   between appropriations. When a work request will be made to a different component, another
   Service, or an organization funded by a separate appropriation, steps must be taken to ensure
   that all labor and other costs are paid by the correct appropriation in order to avoid
   augmentation, deficiency issues and purpose violations. AFMAN 20-118 (when published),
   AFI 65-601, and DoD FMR should be referenced and a legal review conducted if necessary.
   3.3.4. Manage Network Performance. This core process provides managers the ability to
   monitor repair support via tracking node, network, product group, and enterprise output
   performance. The goal of this process is to ensure availability, affordability, and performance
   of repair activities.
