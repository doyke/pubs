1.2. General. Repair Network Management is a process-focused effort designed to standardize
work and reduce waste and costs of Intermediate and Depot-level repair through comprehensive
management at an AF Enterprise-level, with an ultimate goal of delivering optimized weapons
system availability at the same or reduced cost. Enterprise management examines the core
processes that impact weapon system availability, including product flow, funding, requirements,
capability and capacity (CAP2), and information technology. This concept provides a single
process owner for the Air Force Repair Enterprise, including planning, operations, and strategy.
RNI management processes do not change or re-align chain-of-command relationships, and
repair nodes will continue to report through their chain-of-command.
1.3. General Guidance.
   1.3.1. The objectives of RNI are to:
       1.3.1.1. Transform and sustain maintenance management processes to establish a Repair
       Network to improve efficiency while increasing responsiveness to meet warfighter
       requirements.

     1.4.2. RNI processes will not apply to assets managed solely by Contract Logistics Support
     (CLS) agreements.
     1.4.3. RNI will not control allocation of parts.
1.5. Metrics. Metrics, as a diagnostic tool to aid decision making, will gauge network
performance and evaluate effectiveness of intermediate and depot support.
     1.5.1. Metrics will also provide information that will facilitate identification of problems,
     solutions, benchmarks, changes for maintenance behavior, and goals for network operations.
     1.5.2. Metrics will be divided into the following categories: Availability, Performance, and
     Affordability. These metrics will be a part of the Manage Network Performance core
     management process that will be detailed in AFMAN 20-118, Repair Network Integration
     (when published).

   and develop and/or describe future processes that will support end-state repair network
   capabilities ensuring conformance with regulatory and fiscal guidance. Scope includes all
   funding sources that finance operations of the repair network, both at all locations (organic
   and inter-service) and at all levels. It covers processes for all affected appropriations,
   including Milpers and MPA mandays when required. Using the Program Objective
   Memorandum (POM) process and previously determined RNI goals and objectives as inputs
   for this step, the ERM and PRM must identify the appropriate programming elements where
   RNI Infrastructure Planning goals and objectives should be funded. See AFMAN 20-118
   Repair Network Integration (when published). When a work request will be made to a
   different component, another Service, or an organization funded by a separate appropriation,
   steps must be taken to ensure that all labor and other costs are paid by the correct
   appropriation in order to avoid augmentation, deficiency issues, and purpose violations.
   AFI65-601 and DoDFMR should be referenced, and a legal review conducted, if necessary.
   Prior to implementation of any action involving the ANG, consolidation reporting of
   National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) requirements with supporting analysis, studies,
   financial assessments, and legal reviews must be considered.
   3.2.3. Shape and Size Network. The goal of this core management process is to right-size
   the Air Force repair enterprise, based on appropriate business cost comparisons, risk analysis,
   and war requirements. The repair enterprise shall ensure the Air Force maintains the optimal
   amount of daily and peak repair CAP2 to meet current and future needs of the Air Force,
   joint, foreign, and civilian partners. MAJCOM collaboration is required during the
   development of recommendations to ensure compliance with applicable instructions.

   3.2.4. Workforce and Infrastructure Planning. Evaluate current workforce and infrastructure
   availability against repair requirements. Develop strategic workforce and infrastructure
   requirements for enterprise repair. The output will be long-range workforce and
   infrastructure plans that satisfy repair enterprise Shaping and Sizing recommendations. This
   process should be conducted in parallel with 3.2.2. Programming and Financial Management.
3.3. Operational Processes. Operational processes have a cycle time of 12 months or less, and
can be measured in intervals as short as weeks or days. These processes are short range,
execution year activities performed by the RNM and Node Manager, in collaboration with
network stakeholders, to ensure repair requirements are met. The four operational processes
include:
   3.3.1. Aggregate & Prioritize Requirements. The RNM will receive repair requirements
   from the applicable system in which they are housed in (e.g. Automated Budget Control
   System, D200A Requirements Determination System, Integrated Maintenance Data System
   /GO81).
   3.3.2. Compute Capability & Capacity (CAP2). This process provides the ability to baseline
   node CAP2 and aggregates all node data to determine network CAP2. Node Managers are
   responsible for establishing baseline CAP2 data and providing updates as required by the
   RNM.
   3.3.3. Plan and Allocate Workload. This core process converts validated repair requirements
   into maintenance workload and allocates it across the Repair Network. This process allows
   for workload allocation in the execution year and re-planning work based on changing
   requirements throughout the year. Requirements and CAP2 data are validated and workload
   is allocated appropriately amongst the repair nodes, based on node CAP2. The annual
   workload plan, coordinated through the governance structure and approved by each affected
   MAJCOM, is provided to the repair nodes for production planning. Funds holder and the
   appropriate level of FM coordination are required when plans include moving workload in
   accordance with each appropriations stated fiscal purpose. When a work request will be made
   to a different component, another Service, or an organization funded by a separate
   appropriation, steps must be taken to ensure that all labor and other costs are paid by the
   correct appropriation in order to avoid augmentation, deficiency issues and purpose
   violations. AFI65-601 and DoDFMR should be referenced, and a legal review conducted if
   necessary.
   3.3.4. Manage Network Performance. This core process provides managers the ability to
   monitor repair support via tracking node, network, product group, and enterprise output
   performance. The goal of this process is to ensure availability, affordability, and
   performance of repair activities.
