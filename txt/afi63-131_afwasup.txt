                    MODIFICATION MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

1.1. Purpose. The purpose of this instruction is to implement Secretary of the Air Force
(SECAF) direction contained in AFPD 63-1/20-1, Integrated Life Cycle Management. This
instruction requires that all modifications are coordinated through a formal configuration
review/control process and managed as acquisition programs using processes, techniques, and
governance directed in AFI 63-101/20-101. Refer to Military Handbook MIL-HDBK-61A (SE),
Configuration Management Guidance for additional insight.
   1.1.1. This instruction identifies the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders involved in
   modification management, the process to develop and staff a proposed modification for
   approval and funding, and the process to complete a modification through installation and/or
   removal as applicable.
   1.1.2. Modification requirements are documented, reviewed, and approved using either AF
   Form 1067 or appropriate JCIDS documentation as described in AFI 10-601.
1.2. Applicability. This instruction applies to weapon systems cited in AFPD 10-9, Lead
Command Designation and Responsibilities for Weapon Systems, AFI 10-901, Lead Operating
Command--Communications and Information Systems, other designated systems, subsystems,
and items requiring configuration control as described in MIL-HDBK-61A (SE) .
   1.2.1. This instruction applies to:
      1.2.1.1. Form, fit, function, or interface (F3I) alterations of an in-service hardware or
      software configuration item. The Configuration Item may be part of a weapon system,
      telecommunications system, business system and/or information system. Specifically,
      permanent and temporary alterations that:
          1.2.1.1.1. Satisfy a new end use function/capability.
          1.2.1.1.2. Extend the life of an existing capability.
          1.2.1.1.3. Alter embedded information processing equipment and software as part of
          a weapon system end item.
   1.2.2. This instruction does not apply to:
      1.2.2.1. Replacement Interchangeable Items which do not involve the alteration of an
      existing asset. Per MIL-HDBK-61A, Military Handbook, Configuration Management
      Guidance, an interchangeable product possesses such functional and physical attributes as
      to be equivalent in performance to another product of similar or identical purposes; and is
      capable of being exchanged with the other product without alteration of the products
      themselves or of adjoining products. Apply AFI 63-101/20-101 along with Command and
      local procedures governing program management, technical authorities and configuration
      control requirements associated with installation of interchangeable assets on sub-
      systems or systems.
      1.2.2.2. Operations and maintenance funded actions that keep a previously established
      level of performance through routine, recurring work correction of product quality
 6                                                   AFI63-131_AFWASUP 6 November 2013


       deficiencies or to retain/restore the functional baseline or performance specification and
       do not extend service life of the equipment or alter F3I.
          1.2.2.2.1. Maintenance actions such as the materiel repair, overhaul, or rebuilding of
          parts, assemblies, or subassemblies, and the testing and reclamation of equipment to
          correct a deficient condition in the originally designed functionality. This includes
          depot-level maintenance as defined in Title 10 USC 2460.
       1.2.2.3. Modifications of commercially available office information systems and
       associated software such as network servers and standard desktop computers, or to data
       processing equipment that is used for routine administrative and business support
       functions—except when part of a weapon system or cyber system configuration baseline.
       1.2.2.4. Individual engineering changes completed as part of an existing acquisition
       category (ACAT) program involving developmental items or production articles that
       have not been formally accepted by the government via a Department of Defense Form
       250 (DD 250), Materiel Inspection and Receiving Report.
       1.2.2.5. Assets that are no longer part of an active inventory, such as aircraft in long-term
       storage that are not part of a reutilization effort.
       1.2.2.6. Modifications of facilities or other base-level infrastructure, telecommunications
       equipment, or property.
1.3. Waivers. Where the course of action, as approved and documented through the
programmatic chain of command, conflicts with statuary or regulatory requirements, the
Program Manager (PM) shall submit a request for a waiver to the certifying authority for the
publication as described in AFPD 63-1/20-1 and implementing Air Force Instructions.

                                  MODIFICATION TYPES

3.1. Modification Types. There are two types of modifications, temporary and permanent.
Refer to AFI 10-601 and The Modification Proposal Process section of this instruction for
guidance on the use of AF Form 1067, Modification Proposal for defining, validating, and
approval of modification requirements.
   3.1.1. Modifications to hardware and software satisfy an operational mission requirement by
   removing or adding a capability or function or enhancing technical performance or
   operational suitability. These modifications retain existing capability, extend service life,
   correct product quality deficiencies, or retain/restore the functional baseline or performance
   specification. Modifications may improve the operational availability of the item, transform
   or modernize defense business systems, or reduce ownership costs.
   3.1.2. Modifications to software can add new capability, change the functional baseline,
   increase complexity, or respond to new user requirements. These modifications are generally
   accomplished in tandem with and as a component of associated hardware
   modifications/funding. Software modifications accomplished as a standalone effort to satisfy
   a new operational capability need are managed as an acquisition category program under the
   acquisition chain of authority.
   3.1.3. Program Managers shall coordinate any anticipated modifications, which may involve
   work to be performed under contract with the cognizant contracting officer to assure that the
   modification, either temporary or permanent, is within the scope of the existing contract
   contemplated to perform the work.
3.2. Temporary Modifications. Temporary modifications change the configuration of an item
to enable short-term operational mission accomplishment, or to conduct test and evaluation
(T&E) of new and modified equipment. Temporary modification proposals are validated,
reviewed, approved as described in AFI 10-601, AFI 63-101/20-101 and this instruction. Refer
to AFI 65-601V1 for AF policy on funding. There are two kinds of temporary modifications:
Temporary-1 (T-1) and Temporary-2 (T-2).
   3.2.1. T-1 modifications change the configuration of an item in order to satisfy short-term
   operational mission requirements by adding, modifying, or removing hardware and/or
   software components or capabilities in a manner that provides an immediate operational
   benefit. T-1 modifications typically involve the use of existing off-the-shelf or non-
   developmental items, including stock-listed equipment and materiel. The T-1 Modification
   proposal shall specify the number of units to be modified, duration of installed T-1
   Modification, and plans for removing the modification converting it to a permanent
   modification.
       3.2.1.1. T-1 modifications shall not be used to circumvent the requirements associated
       with permanent modifications, as prescribed in this instruction, or the lack of appropriate
       modification funding.
       3.2.1.2. T-1 modifications are normally accomplished and supported locally by a
       MAJCOM or base-level operational unit. Depending on complexity, accomplishment
14                                                 AFI63-131_AFWASUP 6 November 2013


     and support may be provided with partial or full depot support. In such cases, the
     lead/using command is responsible for funding the depot requirements.
     3.2.1.3. The PM shall ensure all T-1 modifications address operational safety, suitability,
     and effectiveness (OSS&E). In performing this task and fulfilling his responsibility, the
     PM shall coordinate and enlist the support of the engineering authority in addressing
     OSS&E.       Such coordination shall be documented and all comments and
     recommendations of Engineering shall be maintained by the Program Manager and
     Engineering.
     3.2.1.4. T-1 modification proposals shall be approved by the PM, designated lead
     command certification/approval authority, and/or AF/A5R as specified in AFI 10-601.
     Requests must include clear and compelling evidence that shows why the temporary
     modification is needed to support mission requirements. The request shall be coordinated
     through the AFPD 10-9 designated lead command (as applicable), to the PM within
     AFMC, AFSPC or AF/A5R as applicable.
     3.2.1.5. T-1 modifications with duration of greater than 1 year shall be supported by
     clear and compelling justification/rationale to exceed 1 year. All existing T-1s submitted
     under the 5-asset/1 year rule of the July 2001 version of AFI 63-1101(superseded) shall
     submit a new modification proposal (AF Form 1067) in lieu of a waiver.
     3.2.1.6. T-1 modifications are not authorized permanent logistics support such as
     peculiar support equipment and sustaining engineering support. However, minimum
     essential logistics support, including verified technical data or interim contractor support,
     essential for the temporary operation and sustainment of the modification in its
     designated mission environment will be provided, consistent with weapon system support
     concepts and/or product support strategies. The lead command shall determine these
     minimum essential logistics support requirements in coordination with the PM.
     Government personnel (military and civilian) shall use verified technical data in
     installing or maintaining a temporary modification.             Contractors maintaining a
     government asset are also required to use verified technical data in installing or
     maintaining a temporary modification. Verified technical data may be in the contractor’s
     format and not necessarily a verified Air Force Technical Order.
     3.2.1.7. T-1 modifications may be used to satisfy an urgent operational need (UON) that
     has been validated IAW AFI 10-601, and joint urgent operational needs (JUON) that
     have been validated IAW CJCSI 3470.01, Rapid Validation and Resourcing of Joint
     Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) in the Year of Execution. The CJCS Directives
     Library can be accessed at http://www.dtic.mil/cjcs_directives/index.htm.
     3.2.1.8. All T-1 modifications will be removed from the host system or component at the
     end of the modification period specified on the approved AF Form 1067. If a new AF
     Form 1067 or other equivalent requirements documentation as described in AFI 10-601 is
     approved to replace the T-1 with a permanent modification in lieu of removal, use
     acquisition policy, procedures, processes, and funding guidance described in AFI 63-
     101/20-101 for converting to a permanent modification. The lead command will provide
     the PM with the new approved AF Form 1067 to use in updating the Life Cycle
     Sustainment Plan (LCSP) to ensure permanent life cycle management issues such as
     supportability are addressed.
AFI63-131_AFWASUP 6 November 2013                                                           15


     3.2.1.9. Organizations requesting to extend the installation of a T-1 modification beyond
     the currently approved quantity or time period shall prepare and submit a new
     modification proposal.
     3.2.1.10. T-1 modifications will be removed prior to host weapon system/component
     input for programmed depot maintenance (PDM) unless otherwise coordinated between
     the lead command/using organization and the depot maintenance activity. In the rare
     situation where a T-1 modification is not removed prior to PDM, the lead command/using
     organization shall coordinate with the performing depot maintenance organization to
     ensure the T-1 modification does not interfere with scheduled maintenance activities and
     that maintenance activities do not alter the installed T-1 modification.
     3.2.1.11. T-1 modification includes the inherent authority to install developmental
     components of the modification, conduct testing for the purposes of engineering
     investigations, and evaluate the modification as necessary to ensure the configuration
     satisfies the T-1 requirement and preserve OSS&E.
     3.2.1.12. T-1 modified assets must be capable of being returned to their original or
     currently approved permanent configuration within a time period specified by the lead
     command (typically 48 hours) and documented in AF Form 1067.
     3.2.1.13. T-1 modification proposals will describe any demilitarization and disposition of
     components when removed.
  3.2.2. T-2 modifications are used to evaluate, demonstrate, or exercise the technical
  performance, operational effectiveness, and/or the operational suitability of developmental
  and/or test materiel (hardware, firmware and software) capabilities. T-2 modifications are
  also used to install and operate T&E-specific support equipment, instrumentation and data
  recording equipment, telemetry systems, etc., on T&E assets. T-2 modifications may be used
  in support of all forms of T&E activity, including developmental test and evaluation,
  operational test and evaluation, and MAJCOM-conducted force development evaluation
  activities. Information on testing and evaluating systems can be found in AFI 99-103.
     3.2.2.1. The PM, the lead command, and designated test agencies will collaboratively
     determine the number of assets requiring T-2 modification based on the scope,
     complexity, and length of T&E activities. They will collaboratively determine the
     organizational roles, responsibilities, and procedures for the configuration management,
     installation, operation, sustainment, and funding requirements for each T-2 modifications.
     The test center and labs with MAJCOM/lead command delegated modification
     engineering authority and configuration control board authority use approval processes
     defined by command instructions.
     3.2.2.2. PMs, lead commands, and test organizations may create a single T-2
     modification proposal that cover a specified period of time or series of integrated test
     activities for the purpose of conducting incremental hardware and software Test &
     Evaluation (T&E) , or to identify a range of test support equipment that may be installed
     in support of T&E activities. In this case, the T-2 modification proposal enables PMs,
     lead commands, and test organizations to install and remove developmental and/or test
     materiel (hardware, firmware, and software), or specific pieces of test support equipment
     on designated test assets without the need for repeated configuration management
 16                                                 AFI63-131_AFWASUP 6 November 2013


       reviews and approvals. However, in such cases, PMs, lead commands, and test agencies
       shall collaborate as necessary to maintain accurate and up-to-date configuration control
       of affected test assets, and to coordinate specific materiel installation requirements and
       activities.
       3.2.2.3. T&E organizations and lead commands shall assist the PM as necessary to
       ensure OSS&E of T-2 modified assets, and to ensure T-2 modified assets are provided
       sufficient sustainment support as needed to complete directed T&E activities.
       3.2.2.4. T-2 modifications will be maintained on the test asset(s) for as long as necessary
       to complete T&E activities specified in approved test plans, and then be removed,
       returning the asset to its original or current approved permanent configuration.
       Instrumentation data collection and other support equipment used for both current and
       future test data collection requirements are not normally removed after each test. Such T-
       2 modifications will be removed when no longer required. The T-2 modification
       approval authority shall authorize retention or removal of instrumentation data collection
       and other support equipment on test assets during T-2 modification proposal review,
       validation, and approval processes.
       3.2.2.5. T-2 modifications will normally be removed prior to host weapon
       system/component input for programmed depot maintenance (PDM) unless otherwise
       coordinated between the lead command/using organization and the depot maintenance
       activity. In the rare situation where a T-2 modifications are not removed prior to PDM,
       the lead command/using organization shall coordinate with the programmed depot
       maintenance activity in updating the work package to describe the T-2 modification and
       ensure it does not interfere with the programmed maintenance actions and that
       maintenance actions do not alter the installed T-2 modification.
       3.2.2.6. A T-2 modification may be used to support T&E of proposed permanent
       configuration changes. Upon the conclusion of T&E activity, the lead command, in
       coordination with PM, shall determine if the modification will be fielded. If fielded, the
       T-2 modification may remain in place upon completion of T&E activity while a
       permanent modification proposal is processed and implemented IAW the provisions of
       this instruction. The T-2 modification will be upgraded to the approved permanent
       configuration as part of the permanent modification program.
3.3. Permanent Modifications. Permanent modifications change the configuration of an
asset/software for operational effectiveness, suitability, survivability, service life extension,
and/or reduce ownership costs of a fielded weapon system, subsystem, or item. Some permanent
modifications are further designated as safety modifications.
   3.3.1. Permanent modifications are used to satisfy requirements approved IAW AFI 10-601,
   AFI 63-101/20-101, and this instruction. An approved permanent modification includes the
   inherent authority to install developmental components of the modification on test assets for
   the purposes of conducting engineering investigations, developmental testing, and/or other
   evaluation of the modification. An approved permanent modification also includes the
   inherent authority to perform trial TCTO kit installations and TCTO verification activities on
   dedicated test assets in order to verify the installation procedures and sustainment elements
   associated with the modification prior to full-rate kit production and/or fleet-wide
   installation. A separate T-2 Modification Proposal is required when trial TCTO kit installs,
AFI63-131_AFWASUP 6 November 2013                                                                17


   proofing, and verification activities are performed on operational assets/combat coded
   aircraft instead of dedicated test assets/aircraft.
   3.3.2. Permanent modifications shall only be accomplished in response to an approved AF
   Form 1067, Modification Proposal or capability requirements document as described in AFI
   10-601. PMs may initiate systems engineering tasks and preliminary design activities in
   anticipation of approved modification documentation, but must consider the technical
   complexity and maturity of the stated need, along with programmatic risk, when preparing
   modification program strategies and plans. In such cases, the PM will limit expenditures to
   the modification financing allowed by AFI 65-601V1 while the requirement is undergoing
   coordination and approval. The modification requirement must be fully documented in an
   approved modification proposal/capability requirements document prior to starting the
   modification, usually at program initiation for modifications managed as an acquisition
   category program.
   3.3.3. Normally, permanent modifications will be installed across the entire inventory of the
   host weapon system or product line. However, when necessary to support operational
   mission requirements, permanent modifications may be installed on a subset of the host
   weapon system or product line inventory with the approval of the lead command, applicable
   PM, and AF/A5R as described in AFI 10-601 and this instruction. Permanent modifications
   are acquisition category programs funded with investment dollars which fall under the
   acquisition chain of authority.
   3.3.4. Permanent modifications may be conducted in discrete installation segments (e.g.,
   “Group A” and “Group B” TCTO kit segments) when necessary to support operational
   mission or deployment requirements or to manage the host weapon system or product line
   inventory in a cost effective manner. In this case, the content of each modification segment
   must be approved by the lead command and the applicable PM. Full funding policy requires
   that all TCTO kit segments be procured with a single year appropriation to field an increment
   of capability.
   3.3.5. Permanent modifications will be provided full logistics support (e.g., spares, support
   equipment, technical data, item unique identification (IUID), serialized item management,
   etc.) commensurate with the host system or component maintenance concept and product
   support strategy/plans. Consult AFI 63-101/20-101 for sustainment planning requirements.
   3.3.6. When considering modification proposals, approval authorities shall seek the most
   cost effective solution over the system’s life cycle and determine availability, suitability, and
   supportability of considered and selected solutions.
3.4. Safety Modifications. Safety modifications are permanent modifications that correct
materiel or other deficiencies which could endanger the safety or health of personnel, or cause
the loss of, or extensive damage to, systems or equipment. Safety modifications are primarily

                                          Chapter 4

                      THE MODIFICATION PROPOSAL PROCESS

4.1. Modification Proposal Overview. The AF Form 1067, Modification Proposal process
starts with identification and documentation of a modification requirement and ends when the
proposal is certified and approved as described by AFI 10-601 and this instruction. Refer to AFI
10-601 for further guidance on requirements.
   4.1.1. A modification proposal is the document or combination of documents needed for
   approval to initiate a modification action. The modification proposal process consists of four
   steps: 1) request for action and organization validation, 2) using command and lead
   command validation, 3) program manager review and approval of technical requirements and
   solution, and 4) lead command certification and subsequent approval by the approval
   authority specified in AFI 10-601.
   4.1.2. The AF Form 1067 is the document normally used to initiate temporary modifications
   and permanent sustainment modifications for fielded systems and equipment. An AF Form
   1067 can also be used to document the submission, review, and approval of requirements for
   permanent capability modifications estimated to cost no more than ten percent of the
   minimum threshold dollar values for ACAT II programs. The AF Form 1067 provides a
   means to track modification proposals through the approval/funding process, and to maintain
   configuration control of items affected by the modification, even though the capability is
   described in a previously approved capability requirements document. The form provides a
   means for the system or commodity manager with configuration control and engineering
   authority over the affected asset(s) to document the technical parameters associated with the
   modification, such as systems engineering requirements and recommendations, impacts to
   logistics support elements associated with the asset(s), and the type and amount of funding
   necessary to accomplish the modification.
       4.1.2.1. Quick reaction capability modifications processing is described in AFI 10-601
       and AFI 63-114. Urgent and compelling requirements are documented as UON, JUON,
       or Chief of Staff of the Air Force direction. UONs that emerge during conflicts or other
       crisis situations often involve modifications to in-service weapon systems and equipment.
       An AF Form 1067 is generated and processed to summarize the modification
       requirement, to document the technical parameters necessary to satisfy the urgent need,
       and to initiate the modification management processes.
       4.1.2.2. Other modification proposal documents, such as airworthiness directives
       produced by the FAA and service bulletins developed by defense industry manufacturers,
       may fulfill modification proposal documentation requirements and be attached to the AF
       Form 1067 for recording required reviews and approvals.
   4.1.3. JCIDS documents are used to initiate/establish the user’s modification requirement(s)
   for modifications that are estimated to exceed 10% of ACAT II dollar thresholds. The
   requesting organization must complete a JCIDS document (initial capabilities document,
   capability development document, etc) to establish the user’s modification requirement(s).
   Consult AFI 10-601 for detailed information on the AF requirements generation and JCIDS
   document preparation and approval processes.
AFI63-131_AFWASUP 6 November 2013                                                               23


       4.1.3.1. The requesting organization will be advised to complete a formal JCIDS
       document to establish the user’s requirement(s) for permanent modifications upon
       determination at any point of the AF Form 1067 review/certification process that the
       requirement exceeds thresholds defined in AFI 10-601.
   4.1.4. A new capability document is not required where the proposed capability was
   previously established in an approved JCIDS document or single AF Form 1067 used for T-2
   modifications.
4.2. Step 1, Request for Action and Organization Validation. In this step all modification
requirements are defined and validated. The PM shall ensure that validated requirements are
documented IAW the process and criteria outlined in AFI 10-601, AFI 63-101/20-101, and this
instruction prior to initiating the modification.
   4.2.1. Individuals (Program Offices, Operational Units, Sustainment activities, etc.) initiate a
   modification proposal by completing Sections 1 through 10 of the AF Form 1067.
       4.2.1.1. Temporary modifications requirements shall include in block 9 of the AF Form
       1067; number of units to be modified, total duration of the installed temporary
       modification, and description of the user’s/Program Manager’s /lead command’s plan for
       converting the temporary modification into a permanent capability, or their plan for
       removing the modification from affected articles.
       4.2.1.2. Modification proposals developed in response to a UON will include this
       statement in Section 9 of the AF Form 1067 “This modification is needed to address an
       Urgent Operational Need.”
   4.2.2. After completing sections 1-10, the initiator shall submit the AF Form 1067 to the
   organization-level authority for validation.
   4.2.3. The organization-level validation authority completes Section 11 using procedures
   established by the parent MAJCOM/FOA/DRU and/or local instructions. The organization
   shall forward the validated AF Form 1067 to the parent MAJCOM/FOA/DRU for further
   review and action.
4.3. Step 2, Using Command and Lead Command Validation. In this step, the using and
lead commands/FOA/DRU verifies the modification requirement is a valid need that provides a
materiel solution to resolve capability gaps. Validation is not approval for a proposed materiel
solution and does not authorize implementation.
   4.3.1. The initiator’s parent MAJCOM/FOA/DRU headquarters shall validate the proposed
   modification and complete AF Form 1067; Section 12 IAW established
   MAJCOM/FOA/DRU procedures. The using command shall forward the validated AF Form
   1067 to the applicable lead MAJCOM/FOA/DRU or other AFPD 10-9/AFI 10-901
   designated organization for further review and action.
   4.3.2. The lead command/FOA/DRU or AFPD 10-9/AFI 10-901 designated organization
   shall validate the proposed modification via prescribed requirements and processes
   established by the lead command. The lead command shall coordinate the modification
   proposal with all affected using commands and supporting organizations, such as training
   and logistics support units. Lead commands/organizations shall forward all proposed safety
   modifications to the Chief of Air Force Safety for coordination and approval of the safety
 24                                                AFI63-131_AFWASUP 6 November 2013


   designation. Once validated, the lead command shall prioritize the modification proposal for
   funding and implementation. The lead command completes Sections 13 through 22 and
   forwards modification proposals designated for funding and implementation to the applicable
   PM for initial technical evaluation, implementation planning, and cost estimation.
   4.3.3. For modifications involving multiple mission variants within a given asset design-
   series that are assigned to multiple lead MAJCOMs (e.g., AC/C/EC/MC/HC/WC-130,
   C/KC/RC/WC-135), each lead MAJCOM shall validate the modification proposal against
   assigned assets, and the lead MAJCOM responsible for the largest number of assets within
   the given design-series will have overall responsibility for validating and approving the
   modification proposal. If the modification proposal is ultimately approved, each lead
   MAJCOM shall determine whether or not to implement the modification on its assigned
   assets. Each lead command shall attach supporting documentation to the AF Form 1067 to
   record their decisions and to provide an audit trail for configuration control purposes.
4.4. Step 3, Program Manager Review and Approval of Technical Requirements and
Solution.
   4.4.1. The PM initiates a technical evaluation with the assistance of the systems engineering
   authority for the affected configuration item(s). The PM shall determine preliminary
   technical impacts and systems engineering-related requirements to implement the proposed
   modification. Such evaluations will include:
      4.4.1.1. Determination of the impacts to the host weapon system/component’s OSS&E
      baseline, as well as any operating certifications or restrictions associated with the host
      weapon system/component, such as airworthiness certifications, munitions
      carriage/employment certifications, environmental safety and occupational health
      certifications, security certifications, Information Assurance, SEEK EAGLE, etc.
      4.4.1.2. This evaluation will also determine the potential impacts to, and any corollary
      modification requirements for, training systems/devices and intelligence or information-
      related systems and networks that may be required to operate, maintain compatibility
      with, or sustain the proposed modification.
      4.4.1.3. The PM shall also determine the sustainment support needs associated with the
      proposed modification, including system/product reliability, availability, maintainability,
      and supportability impacts and requirements.
      4.4.1.4. The PM shall also conduct a risk analysis and safety assessment for the proposed
      modification and identify any necessary risk acceptance documentation, safety
      certifications, or statements that must accompany the modification IAW AFI 63-101/20-
      101, AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, AFI 91-217, Space
      Safety And Mishap Prevention Program, and MIL-STD-882D.
      4.4.1.5. The PM shall determine if the modification will involve or produce critical
      program information (CPI); if CPI is identified, update the PPP and Acquisition Security
      Database.
      4.4.1.6. The PM shall ensure this initial technical evaluation encompasses all
      configuration items and external interfaces whose functional/product baselines may be
      affected by the proposed modification.
AFI63-131_AFWASUP 6 November 2013                                                             25


         4.4.1.6.1. The PM shall coordinate these initial technical and programmatic
         requirements with other affected system/product management entities, such as Air
         Logistics Complex (ALC), training system program management offices, technology
         development organizations, etc.
         4.4.1.6.2. The PM shall denote the modification category (i.e. capability or
         sustainment modification) in Section 39 of the AF Form 1067 and in applicable
         modification program plans.
      4.4.1.7. In conjunction with the initial technical evaluation of a proposed modification
      and in coordination with the lead command, the PM shall develop a preliminary strategy
      to implement the modification. This strategy will address the management approach to
      implementing the modification and include, at a minimum, a top-level description of how
      the modification should be funded, developed, tested, produced, fielded, and supported,
      along with an estimated schedule for implementing the modification.
      4.4.1.8. The PM shall develop formal cost estimates to implement the proposed
      modification IAW procedures prescribed in AFPD 65-5, Cost and Economics as well as
      the AFI/AFMAN 65-500 series publications and approved AFMC/AFSPC cost
      estimating techniques. This estimate shall include all should costs and affordability costs
      associated with the development, operation, and sustainment of modification throughout
      its expected life cycle. Any cost estimates provided by commercial vendors or other
      government agencies will be validated by the PM. For temporary modifications, this
      estimate shall include costs for host system de-modification and disposal (as applicable).
      Additional cost estimating requirements are prescribed in AFI 63-101/20-101 and AFPD
      65-5, and applicable AFI/AFMAN 65-500 series publications.
      4.4.1.9. The PM shall attest to the feasibility of the proposed modification requirement
      by including/appending the following statement in Section 39 of the AF Form 1067 “The
      operational requirement(s) described in this modification proposal is (are) technically
      achievable and executable within the estimated schedule and costs identified herein.” For
      modification proposals initiated with a JCIDS document, PMs shall follow internal
      AFMC/AFSPC procedures for attesting to the feasibility of ICD/CCD/CPD requirements.
      4.4.1.10. The PM shall complete Sections 23 through 42 of the AF Form 1067 to provide
      the completed technical evaluation, preliminary implementation strategy and schedule,
      and cost estimates to the lead command and the SAF/AQ Capability Directorate PEM to

         RDT&E.
         4.5.4.1.5. Embedded information processing equipment and software.
     4.5.4.2. Modification programs may involve the use of multiple appropriation types in
     order to implement the modification. Different appropriations may be necessary to fund
     separate and distinct tasks associated with the modification. For instance, RDT&E funds
     will often be necessary to design and test the modification, while procurement funds are
     often required to produce and install the modification. Modification programs will
     comply with full funding policy detailed in AFI 65-601V1 and DoD 7000.14-R, V2A,
     Chapter 1.
AFI63-131_AFWASUP 6 November 2013                                                          27


     4.5.4.3. Any modification program or project that has not been previously justified to
     and approved by Congress during the appropriations process for the fiscal year involved
     is considered a new start. When a determination has been made that a modification
     proposal meets new start criteria, Congress must be notified via either a letter of
     notification or a completed Department of Defense Form 1415-1, Prior Approval
     Reprogramming Action. Modifications that result from FAA-issued service bulletins are
     also considered new starts if they are not consistent with the “Service Bulletin” budget
     line item materials provided to Congress. Refer to AFI 65-601V1 and DoD 7000.14-R,
     V3, Chapter 6 for specific requirements, processes, and stipulations associated with new
     start notifications.
     4.5.4.4. Individual modifications funded in the low cost modification line generally
     satisfy an unforeseen requirement for the entire weapon system inventory/fleet that is
     estimated to complete within one year. Total funding for the low cost modification of the
     entire weapon system inventory cannot exceed $2.0M. Any effort not consistent with the
     low cost modification line budget documentation (P-40) or efforts exceeding the $2.0M
     dollar threshold are not considered low cost modifications and are subject to new start
     guidelines.

                             MODIFICATION MANAGEMENT

5.1. Modification Management Overview. Permanent modifications are financed with
investment funds per AFI 65-601V1 and managed as Acquisition Category programs. Required
acquisition category program documentation (ADM, SEP, PPP, LCSP, IUID Implementation
Plan, etc) is either generated and/or updated to incorporate the modification effort as described in
AFI 63-101/20-101. Where practical, all existing life cycle management documentation (SEP,
LCSP, etc.) will be updated to reflect modification efforts rather than generating the additional
documentation described in this chapter. Regardless of the documentation method, all life cycle
management documentation relating to permanent and temporary modifications will be retained
by the PM for historical reference and audit trail on configuration control
   5.1.1. All modification activities in continued materiel support of an AFPD 10-9 designated
   weapon system shall be assigned a program manager. The PM shall have overall
   management authority and be held accountable to accomplish the development, production,
   and sustainment objectives for a given modification activity and coordinate planning,
   programming, budgeting, and execution of the modification.
   5.1.2. Modification installation/removal is not initiated without the approved requirements
   document described in AFI 10-601, AFI 63-101/20-101, and this instruction.
   5.1.3. Temporary modifications, whether for a mission or for test and evaluation, will be
   appropriately documented in the equipment status forms (AFTO 781-series or 244-series)
   and appropriate historical records (AFTO Form 95). Annotation will be in the active portion
   (the AFTO Form 781A for instance) of the records. The temporary modification annotation
   will remain there and active until the equipment is returned to the original configuration.
   Refer to T.O. 00-20-2, Maintenance Data Documentation for additional guidance on
   documentation requirements.
5.2. Document the Modification. The PM is responsible for documenting a baseline and
strategy reflecting a tailored and responsive modification program.
   5.2.1. All modifications managed as an Acquisition Category (ACAT) program shall comply
   with the baseline and documentation requirements specified in AFI 10-601 and AFI 63-
   101/20-101.
       5.2.1.1. Prior to issuing a final request for proposal, a contract, or finalizing internal
       government work specifications, the PM shall establish a technical requirements baseline
       for the program. The technical requirements baseline is derived from the operational
       requirement(s) specified by the organization(s) that requested and approved the
       modification proposal.
   5.2.2. Temporary modifications are not managed as an acquisition program. The baseline
   and additional documentation will be attached to the AF Form 1067 for reviews and
   subsequent approval.
       5.2.2.1. The AF Form 1067 approved by the lead command is the source for the
       technical requirements baseline. For modifications involving an engineer change
AFI63-131_AFWASUP 6 November 2013                                                                  29


       proposal (ECP), use the technical description of the engineering change(s) contained in
       the ECP for developing the technical requirements baseline.
       5.2.2.2. The PM will ensure data required for T-1 and T-2 modifications shall be
       developed and acquired commensurate with the modification scope, duration, and
       employment. The PM shall document data requirements for temporary modifications in
       the AF Form 1067.
   5.2.3. The PM shall ensure all modifications include a plan for product support and logistics
   requirements as described in AFI 63-101/20-101 and AFPAM 63-128 to ensure the
   modification is sustainable for the duration of its intended life cycle. Generally, this involves
   updating the existing weapon system life cycle sustainment plan to reflect modification
   requirements in terms of all applicable integrated product support elements.
       5.2.3.1. For temporary modifications, the PM will collaborate with lead/using commands
       and participating test organizations to determine the minimal support requirements and
       responsibilities necessary to accomplish, operate and maintain the modification during its
       limited installation lifespan.
5.3. Report and Monitor Program Status. The PM shall initiate and maintain modification
data to include, at a minimum, cost, schedule, performance, test, logistics, contracts, finance,
risk, and earned value (as applicable) and report periodically through the integrated life cycle
management governance chain of authority.
5.4. Field/Install the Modification. Permanent modifications are generally installed on AF
weapon systems and equipment using a time compliance technical order (TCTO) prepared IAW
AFI 63-101/20-101 and TO 00-5-15, Air Force Time Compliance Technical Order Process.
Contractor-provided field service bulletins and FAA-issued airworthiness directives and service
bulletins may also prescribe specific modification installation procedures and requirements.
Temporary modifications are generally installed using a technical/engineering data package that
describes the system/component engineering changes and outlines the component modification
instructions to be accomplished. This data package must be approved by the applicable
system/component engineering authority prior to installation. PMs, lead commands, and test
agencies shall coordinate as necessary to define specific technical/engineering data package
requirements.
   5.4.1. The PM shall coordinate modification installation requirements and timelines with the
   lead command and all affected organizations, including product support providers. The PM
   shall ensure modification installation activities do not begin until the lead and using
   commands have identified and resolved any fielding issues associated with the modification.
   Additionally, the PM shall ensure sufficient time is provided to develop and field any
   infrastructure or other product support requirements that will be necessary to operate and
   sustain the modification once it is fielded.
   5.4.2. All modification installation documents shall be approved by the system/component
   engineering authority and the PM. Upon receipt of the approved modification proposal
   document from the lead command, the PM shall coordinate the modification installation
   schedule with all affected organizations. Prior to trial kit installation, T&E activities, or field
   operation, the PM shall issue any requisite certifications that accompany the modification,
   such as safety of flight releases or airworthiness certifications.

      5.4.2.1. Modifications to AF systems and equipment whose engineering authority is a
      non-AF executive agent shall be approved by that executive agent. If such modifications
      are funded by the AF, the AF PM shall also approve the modification prior to installation.
      For these systems, the executive agent is not required to produce an installation TCTO if
      a comparable document is produced.
      5.4.2.2. Temporary and permanent modifications may be installed at base level by
      organic unit/MAJCOM personnel that initiated the modification proposal, by PM and
      organic field teams, and by contractor logistics support personnel, or a combination
      thereof. Modifications may also be conducted in conjunction with depot maintenance
      activities, at contractor facilities, or a combination thereof.
5.5. Program Close-out. Proper disposal will be ensured for modification kits that become
excess. For configuration control and management purposes, a complete copy of the
modification package will be maintained IAW AFI 33-364, Records Disposition Procedures and
Responsibilities and the AF Records Disposition Schedule.
   5.5.1. All temporary modifications will close out when they are replaced by permanent
   modifications or removed from the host system or component as specified in the approved
   AF Form 1067.
   5.5.2. When a TCTO is or will be rescinded, and there are excess kits, the PM shall verify
   that all affected systems/items/equipment spares have been modified and provide supply
   chain managers with disassemble/disposition instructions for the excess kits per AFMAN 23-
   110, USAF Supply Manual.
   5.5.3. Technical data, which exists prior to the modification, must be retained until all
   affected systems/items/equipment have been modified. When the last asset has been
   modified, all pre-existing data must be updated by formal changes or revisions to technical
   data/manuals, thus ensuring the current configuration is reflected.
   5.5.4. When the modification has been completed, shipping or disposition instructions for
   government furnished equipment/material must be provided. The PM shall be notified when
   modification kit installation has been completed and the TCTO has been rescinded.
   5.5.5. Unsuccessful completion of the modification must also be documented including the
   reason for termination and any plan to recover assets.

Terms
Acquisition—The conceptualization, initiation, design, development, testing, contracting,
production, deployment, and disposal of a directed and funded effort that provides a new,
improved, or continued materiel, weapon, information system, logistics support, or service
capability in response to an approved need.
Acquisition Category (ACAT)—The United States Department of Defense divides future
acquisition programs into acquisition categories. The differences between these categories
depend on their size and programmatic differences.
Defense Business System—A Defense Business System is an information system, other than a
national security system, operated by, for, or on behalf of the Department of Defense including
financial systems, mixed systems (financial and non-financial in one system), financial data
feeder systems, and information technology and information assurance infrastructure, used to
support business activities, strategic planning and budgeting, installations and environment, and
human resource management.
Configuration Item—A Configuration Item is a hardware, firmware, or software component, or
combination thereof, that satisfies an end use function and is designated for separate
configuration management. Hardware Configuration Items are typically referred to by an
alphanumeric identifier, while software Configuration Items are typically assigned a computer
program identification number.
Fit—Fit involves the manner in which an asset physically attaches to, or integrates with an
adjacent component or higher level assembly. For hardware assets, fit involves such things as
mechanical and electrical attachment points and methods (i.e., connectors, mounting trays,
equipment racks, etc.). For firmware and software assets, fit involves the manner in which
computer language, media, operating system is installed into its host platform. It includes the
ability to interface/interconnect with or become an integral part of its host system, subsystem, or
item. It is the software’s adaptation to changes in its operating environment and its ability to
execute to functional specifications documented in the systems capability requirements
documents. For human integration, fit is the manner in which the hardware, firmware or
software accommodates the human into the design solution.
Form—Form involves the dimensions, shape, size, mass, appreciable weight and other visual
parameters that uniquely distinguish a part of an asset which negatively impacts adjacent
components, requiring modification or reconfiguration for installation. Changes in appearance
 36                                                 AFI63-131_AFWASUP 6 November 2013


such as paint color/finishes are not modifications. Form includes such things as computer
Language and the media upon which the application is hosted. For firmware and software assets,
form refers to the source code.
Function—Function involves the manner in which a system/software operates, performs an
intended action, or provides a designated capability. It is the actions that an asset/software are
designed to perform.
Group A—Parts or components (including software) permanently or temporarily installed in a
Configuration Item to support, secure, interconnect or accommodate the equipment in a Group B
kit.
Group B—Parts or components (including software) that complete a modification when
installed in the Configuration Item, and are normally readily removable.
Interface—Interface is the performance, functional, and physical characteristics required to exist
at a common boundary. The common boundary is where two or more assets (hardware/software)
at the system, sub-system, or item level, converge and act upon one another (i.e., communicate,
transfer data, etc.). Interface may also include the physical, electronic, electrical, functional,
and/or the human-system integration characteristics two or more assets must exhibit in order to
create a functional system.
Interchangeable—Item - A item that possesses such functional and physical attributes as to be
equivalent in performance to another product of similar or identical purposes; and is capable of
being exchanged with the other product without alteration of the products themselves or of
adjoining products.
Low Cost Modification—Individual modifications funded in the Low Cost Modification line
generally satisfy an unforeseen requirement estimated to complete within one year. Total funding
for efforts on the Low cost Mod line for each fiscal year should not exceed $2.0M per year.
Maintenance Action—A maintenance action is any routine or recurring effort (to include
software Block, Cycle, or planned program updates), at the field or depot level that is conducted
to sustain the operational availability of an in-service end item of equipment. Maintenance
actions may include refurbishment and overhaul of equipment, removal and replacement of
components, and the repair or remanufacturing of reparable components.
Major Defense Acquisition Program—Statutory requirements for MDAP is described by Title
10 United States Code Section 2430. A DoD Acquisition program is designated as an MDAP
program based on the size and programmatic differences as described in DoDI 5000.02. The
size, in terms of dollar value is estimated by the USD(AT&L).
Major Automated Information Systems—Statutory requirements described by Chapter 144A
of Title 10 U.S.C. A DoD acquisition program for an Automated Information System (product
or service) that is either designated as MAIS by the MDA or depend on their size and
programmatic differences as described in DoDI 5000.02.
Materiel Manager—Individuals and activities responsible for provisioning, cataloging,
requirements determination, acquisition, distribution, maintenance, and disposal as prescribed in
DoD 4140.1-R, DoD Supply Chain Materiel Management Regulation.
AFI63-131_AFWASUP 6 November 2013                                                              37


Modification—For the purposes of this instruction, a modification is defined as an alteration to
the form, fit, function, or interface (F3I) of an in-service AF hardware or software Configuration
Item.
National Security System (NSS)—Per 44 USC Section 3542 (b) (2), NSS means any
information system (including any telecommunications system) used or operated by an agency or
by a contractor of an agency, or other organization on behalf of an agency:
(i)—the function, operation, or use of which:
(I)—involves intelligence activities;
(II)—involves cryptologic activities related to national security;
(III)—involves command and control of military forces;
(IV)—involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system; or
(V)—subject to subparagraph (B), is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence
missions; or
(ii)—is protected at all times by procedures established for information that have been
specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order or an Act of Congress to
be kept classified in the interest of national defense or foreign policy. NSS does not include a
system that is to be used for routine administrative and business applications (including payroll,
finance, logistics, and personnel management applications).
Product Group Manager—Designated individual for overall management of a specified
product group; includes responsibility for cost, schedule and performance aspects along with the
sustainment elements of the group’s products. PGMs shall support overall system objectives as
required by the PM.
Program Manager—The PM is the DODD 5000.01 designated individual with the
responsibility for and authority to accomplish program objectives for development, production,
and sustainment to meet the users operational needs. ACAT I, ACAT IA, and non-delegated
ACAT II SPMs and PMs shall be chartered by the SAE and the PEO. Delegated ACAT II and III
PMs shall be chartered by the PEO. Additional guidance and examples of PM charters can be
found in AFPAM 63-128.
Service Life Extension Programs (SLEP)—A SLEP extend the life of existing military
equipment such as airplanes and engines. SLEP enables the Air Force to use still-functional
military equipment after its anticipated retirement date. For example, A SLEP can compensate
for expected schedule delays or a slip in achieving operational readiness of new replacement
military equipment. Generally, extending the service life of military equipment involves the
modification and/or upgrade of core components using technology that was not available when
