Chapter1. GENERAL GUIDANCE
  1.1. Introduction. IFS prepares pilot, remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) pilot, and combat
  systems officer (CSO) candidates for UFT. IFS encompasses several screening/training
  programs, including pilot IFS, pilot IFS for civilian Part 61/141 flight schools, RPA pilot
  IFS, RPA pilot IFS for civilian Part 61/141 flight schools, CSO IFS, and CSO IFS for
  civilian Part 61/141 flight schools. Pilot IFS, RPA pilot IFS, and CSO IFS are conducted
  through contracted training at Pueblo, CO. 306th Flying Training Group Commander (306
  FTG/CC), or designated representative-approved flight schools throughout the US conduct
  pilot IFS for civilian Part 61/141 flight schools, RPA pilot IFS for civilian Part 61/141 flight
  schools, and CSO IFS for civilian Part 61/141 flight schools. (Any reference to civilian
  flight schools in this instruction refers to the 306 FTG/CC-approved schools.) These
  programs are collectively referred to as IFS throughout this instruction. IFS is administered
  to all Air Force pilot, RPA pilot, and CSO candidates and is a prerequisite for UFT. Pilot,
  RPA pilot, and CSO candidates with a private pilot certificate are exempt from IFS.

        and graduation dates.
     1.2.9. Immediate Military Supervisor for Students at Civilian Flight Schools. The
     IFS student’s immediate military supervisor is the critical link to the success of the IFS at
     civilian flight schools program and is responsible for day-to-day monitoring of the
     student’s progress. The immediate military supervisor:
        1.2.9.1. Acknowledges receipt and understanding of the 306 FTG/CC (or designated
        representative) -approved IFS information package or briefing.
6                                                  AETCI36-2205V3 20 DECEMBER 2012


       1.2.9.2. Ensures a smooth flow of students into IFS. The immediate supervisor and
       candidate must begin initial preparatory steps immediately after receiving program
       instructions. To prevent scheduling difficulties, immediate supervisors of awaiting
       PCS training (APT) officers enter their candidates into IFS as soon as possible after
       being notified, unless the candidate is scheduled to attend Air and Space Basic Course
       first. Immediate supervisors must realize IFS is a top priority for APT officers.
       Therefore, leave, temporary duty, and deployment duties of these officers must be
       secondary.
       1.2.9.3. Identifies a suitable vendor for students attending civilian flight schools. The
       candidate’s immediate supervisor plays an active role in this critical first-step
       identification process to ensure the provider selected can offer a safe and professional
       training environment. Once a potential vendor is identified, the immediate supervisor
       provides this information to the IFS registrar for final approval and funding
       authorization.
       1.2.9.4. Continues to monitor the student’s progress through IFS completion.
       Training can begin once the vendor is approved and funding is authorized. When IFS
       students complete 12 hours of flying training, the immediate supervisor meets with
       the certified flight instructor (CFI) to review the candidate’s progress. If the
       candidate is experiencing difficulty, the immediate supervisor closely monitors the
       candidate’s progress and forwards a report to the IFS registrar (ANG and AFRC
       reports are routed through the functional major command point of contact [POC]).
       The report identifies student problem areas and what the CFI is doing to correct noted
       weaknesses.
       1.2.9.5. Ensures incidents, unusual events, and mishaps are quickly and properly
       reported to 306 FTG/CC and 1 FTS/CC.
       1.2.9.6. Completes AETC Form 6 to submit any IFS requirement waiver requests.
       Forwards syllabus waiver requests through 1 FTS/CC and 306 FTG/CC to
       AETC/A3F.
       1.2.9.7. Provides a safety briefing before a student begins IFS according to AFI 91-
       202/AETC Supplement 1, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program, and
       documents this safety training on AETC Form 410, High-Risk Activities Worksheet.
       The IFS registrar must receive a copy of this form before approving any purchases or
       flying. (AETC Form 410 is prescribed in AFI 91-202/AETC Supplement 1. Refer to
       that publication for guidance on filling out the form.)
       1.2.9.8. Recommends IFS students for elimination according to the applicable
       syllabus.
    1.2.10. Squadron Commander for students at civilian flight schools:
       1.2.10.1. Manages the commander’s review process.
       1.2.10.2. Forwards syllabus waiver requests (AETC Form 6) according to the
       applicable syllabus.
       1.2.10.3. Recommends IFS students for elimination according to the applicable
       syllabus.
AETCI36-2205V3 20 DECEMBER 2012                                                               7


         1.2.10.4. Submits operational reports according to AFI 10-206/AETC Supplement.
  1.3. Quota Management. The PFT document establishes the baseline for student quota
  management. AETC/A3RA maintains the quota management worksheets, which reflect real-
  time changes and are primary source documents for AETC flying training course class entry,
  student load, and production schedules. These worksheets are available on line at
  https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/DocMan/DOCMain.asp?Filter=OO-OP-AE-
  57&FolderID=OO-OP-AE-57&Tab=0.
     1.3.1. Class Entry Rosters:
         1.3.1.1. The registrar obtains class entry rosters in MilPDS, OTA, or DIMHRS not
         later than 2 weeks before class entry.
         1.3.1.2. The registrar reports roster discrepancies as soon as they are discovered, but
         no later than 5 calendar days following the class start date. Report changes,
         discrepancies, and graduation delays to AETC/A3RA, AFPC/DPSIP, and
         AETC/A3FP.
     1.3.2. Administrative Hold:
         1.3.2.1. Place students whose training has been suspended for more than 7 calendar
         days for other than medical reasons on administrative hold. Administrative hold
         should be used judiciously for extenuating circumstances to include family serious
         illness or death or other personal problems beyond the individual’s control. If a
         student is on administrative hold for more than 10 calendar days or may reach this
         threshold, notify AETC/A3FP. The 1 FTS/CC, or designated representative, works
         with AETC/A3FP and AETC/A1F to determine the disposition of these students. A
         commander’s review (CR) may be warranted for students experiencing extended time
         on administrative hold.
         1.3.2.2. The registrar notifies AETC/FMAM, NGB/A3OC, or AFRC/A3T, as
         appropriate, of every student training delay over 7 calendar days. The servicing
         military personnel flight amends orders for all delays over 7 calendar days.

                                      Student Management
Section 2A—Applicable to IFS Students Screened at Pueblo, CO
Note: See Section 2B for civilian flight school students.
     2.1. Fitness Program. Students must participate in a scheduled physical training (PT)
     program based on the provisions of AFI 36-2905, Fitness Program, guidance from AETC,
     and the IFS syllabus.
        2.1.1. Schedule students for a minimum of three PT sessions each week at times most
        compatible with student screening activities. Group (flight, class, etc.) PT is highly
        encouraged to build esprit de corps but is not required.
        2.1.2. Students unable to complete PT during the scheduled times must complete it
        during off-duty time. PT during off-duty hours does not violate crew rest.
     2.2. End-of-Course Critiques. The 1 FTS/CC approves an end-of-course critique program.
     The contractor may determine the critique’s content and medium. Administer the critique
     within 15 duty days of graduation. Use AETC Form 673, Student Critique, or a 306
     FTG/CC-approved equivalent for written critiques. The contractor’s chief pilot and 1
     FTS/CC, or their delegated representatives, review reports and initiate corrective action as
     necessary. (AETC Form 673 is prescribed in AETCI 36-2205, Volume 1, Formal Flying
     Training Administration and Management. Refer to that publication for guidance on filling
     out the form.)
     2.3. Commander’s Awareness Program:
        2.3.1. Objective. CAP’s objective is to focus supervisory attention on a student’s
        progress in screening, specific deficiencies, and potential to complete the program. CAP
        may also be used to monitor personal issues requiring supervisory attention.
        2.3.2. Categories. CAP is divided into the following categories:
            2.3.2.1. Flying. Students demonstrating flying deficiencies in the aircraft.
            2.3.2.2. Procedural. Students     exhibiting    substandard   general   or     emergency
            procedure knowledge.
            2.3.2.3. Academic. Students exhibiting substandard academic performance.
            2.3.2.4. Airsickness. Students exhibiting chronic, unresolved airsickness.
            2.3.2.5. Military. Students exhibiting substandard military or professional behavior.
            2.3.2.6. Other. Students with personal issues requiring supervisory attention.
        2.3.3. Local Guidance. The 1 FTS/CC approves specific CAP guidance and may
        delegate some CAP administration to the military flight commander (FLT/CC), military
        training officer (MTO), contractor’s chief pilot, contractor’s civilian FLT/CC, or
        equivalent. This guidance addresses such topics as tailored criteria for the different CAP
        categories, student and supervisor notification processes, scheduling restrictions,
        documentation requirements, and instructor continuity requirements.
AETCI36-2205V3 20 DECEMBER 2012                                                                9


     2.3.4. CAP Procedures. The civilian or military FLT/CC/MTO, or above, places
     students on CAP when their supervisors determine it is warranted and removes them
     from CAP when sustained normal progress is demonstrated or when personal issues are
     resolved. Removal should not be strictly event-based (for example, solo), particularly
     when individual weak areas can carry over into the next unit.
         2.3.4.1. For students placed on CAP, the 1 FTS/CC or designated representative
         completes an AETC Form 101, Student Performance Summary (or 306 FTG/CC-
         approved equivalent). AETC Form 101 or its TIMS/GTIMS equivalent is a
         permanent part of students’ IFS training folders. (AETC Form 101 is prescribed in
         AETCI 36-2205, Volume 4. Refer to that publication for guidance on completing the
         form.)
         2.3.4.2. While students are on CAP, tailor screening to address the student’s
         particular situation within the limits of the syllabus. Closely monitor instructor
         continuity. Proficiency standards must not be compromised to permit CAP students
         to progress in screening. Do not exceed additional sorties authorized in the syllabus
         to clear flight deficiencies.
         2.3.4.3. Civilian FLT/CCs provide counseling when students are placed on or
         removed from flying, procedural, academic, airsickness, or other CAP. Inform
         military FLT/CCs/MTOs of the counseling.
         2.3.4.4. Military FLT/CCs/MTOs provide counseling when students are placed on or
         removed from military or other CAP. Inform civilian FLT/CCs of the counseling.
         2.3.4.5. Initial counseling covers CAP objectives, student training plan, IP (instructor
         pilot) continuity, and CAP removal goals. Civilian or military FLT/CCs/MTOs, or
         above, determine when to conduct additional counseling. Additional counseling is
         required if students fail to meet the CAP removal goal. FLT/CCs and supervisors
         update goals appropriately. Document all counseling in the students’ training folders
         on AF Form 4293, Student Activity Record, or 306 FTG/CC-approved equivalent.
         2.3.4.6. Generally, CAP is intended as a short-term program. Students requiring an
         extended period of increased supervision or repeated placement on CAP should be
         considered for a PC or EC. The students’ military FLT/CCs/MTOs brief squadron
         leadership weekly on their students’ progress. As a minimum, this briefing includes
         the students’ strong and weak areas, additional training (AT) details, and anticipated
         removal date from CAP.
  2.4. Progress Check and Elimination Check Procedures. The PC and EC are key events
  in the screening process. Triggers for these events are defined in the applicable syllabus.
  The 1 FTS/CC is the ultimate authority for PC and EC decisions. The contractor is
  responsible for student scheduling and conducting student screening outside the PC and EC
  process. The contractor coordinates with the 1 FTS/CC or designated representative to
  ensure all AT events and requirements are completed prior to a PC or EC. The contractor’s
  scheduler, chief pilot, or designated representative coordinates scheduled PC and EC flights
  with the 1 FTS/CC or designated representative. Coordinate the 1 FTS/CC’s, or his or her
  designated representative, PC- and EC-related requests through the contractor’s chief pilot or
  designated representative. The PC and EC processes require close coordination and
10                                                   AETCI36-2205V3 20 DECEMBER 2012


  partnering between the Air Force leadership and the contractor leadership. The contractor is
  responsible for the screening process. The Air Force leadership is responsible for oversight
  of the contractor and the final decision regarding the student’s rated future. This shared
  responsibility creates overlapping areas of accountability. The contractor and Air Force
  leadership develop processes to ensure there is a clear delineation of specific responsibilities
  so students can be properly evaluated, and both parties can fulfill their general
  responsibilities.
     2.4.1. Authorized PC and EC Pilots. Refer to the IFS syllabus for authorized PC and
     EC pilots. The 1 FTS/CC provides training and certifies PC and EC pilots.
     2.4.2. Ground Evaluations:
         2.4.2.1. PC and EC ground evaluations may be conducted as a result of
         unsatisfactory general knowledge or emergency procedures knowledge or as the
         result of a FLT/CC-directed evaluation for failure to progress or meet syllabus
         standards in procedural knowledge
         2.4.2.2. The designated PC and EC instructor conducts the briefing, ground
         evaluation execution, debriefing, and assigns the overall grade. The ground
         evaluation should be of sufficient length to evaluate the student’s overall procedural
         knowledge.
     2.4.3. PC and EC Guidance:
         2.4.3.1. For PCs generated within a unit, IPs give appropriate instruction in all
         substandard areas, and students accomplish the maneuver information file (MIF)
         items that precipitated the PC. If an unsatisfactory check generates a PC, instructors
         may not offer instruction on MIF items that triggered the PC. When assigning an
         overall grade, instructors consider the student’s overall proficiency and situational
         awareness.
         2.4.3.2. During an EC, students may repeat maneuvers and receive instruction from
         the IP in all areas. In all cases, accomplish the MIF items that precipitated the EC.
         When assigning an overall grade for an aircraft EC, check pilots assess the student’s
         ability to accept instruction and potential to complete IFS and succeed in follow-on
         training
     2.4.4. Grading. Grade a PC or EC according to syllabus guidance. A satisfactory PC or
     EC completes the mission that triggered the check if all original mission objectives are
     met. If the next scheduled mission is the check, all check objectives were satisfied, and
     the student demonstrated the abilities and potential to successfully complete SUPT, RPA
     or CSO training on the PC or EC, then the PC or EC counts as the check.
     2.4.5. Incomplete PC or EC. A PC or EC is “incomplete” only if the mission tasks and
     objectives could not be completed, and a reasonable evaluation of student performance
     could not be made. Do not “incomplete” an aircraft PC or EC for nonflying or ground
     items and recommend another qualified PC or EC instructor administer additional ground
     events to determine the outcome of the PC or EC.
  2.5. Commander’s Review (CR) Process:
AETCI36-2205V3 20 DECEMBER 2012                                                             11


     2.5.1. Overview. The CR recommends a student’s elimination or retention in IFS. The
     CR process must be completed within 10 duty days from the date the initiating authority
     (IA) signs the AETC Form 141.
     2.5.2. Entry. Enter students failing to progress in the normal syllabus flow into the CR
     process. The military FLT/CC/MTO, or above, enters the student in the CR process as

        training according to AFI 36-2205, Applying for Flying Training, Air Battle Manager,
12                                                   AETCI36-2205V3 20 DECEMBER 2012


        and Astronaut Programs. The AA does not recommend students who are eliminated
        for lack of adaptability (LOA) for any other flying training.
  2.6. Student Eliminations:
     2.6.1. Eliminate students if they:
        2.6.1.1. Exhibit LOA, which is the inability to complete the course because of
        physical, psychological, or personality factors. LOA eliminees require an evaluation
        from both medical and rated personnel. This category includes airsickness and
        manifestation of apprehension (MOA). Annotate specific deficiencies in the remarks
        section of AETC Form 141.
        2.6.1.2. Fail to meet proficiency standards of the syllabus in flying, academics, or
        procedures.

        2.6.1.8. Get recalled by the parent unit or higher headquarters. Students are not
        recalled without prior coordination with AETC/A3F per AFI 11-202, Volume 1.
        2.6.1.9. Become involved in drug abuse substantiated by reliable evidence.
        2.6.1.10. Receive adjudication for being absent without leave (AWOL), are confined,
        or have deserted.
        2.6.1.11. Become medically unable to fly, and their condition is not expected to be
        resolved within 5 days. Students may be considered for reinstatement at a later date.
        2.6.1.12. Demonstrate improper attitude or lack of responsibility toward assigned
        duties or obligations. This may include character disorders that raise doubt about the
        student’s fitness for continued service.
     2.6.2. The 12 FTW/CC authorizes the elimination of a student from IFS for misconduct
     which results in or warrants nonjudicial punishment. Based on the totality of the
     circumstances, 306 FTG/CC recommends whether a student should be eliminated from
     training. When misconduct is serious enough to warrant discharge from the service under
     AFI 36-3206, Administrative Discharge Procedures for Commissioned Officers, the
     responsible show-cause authority initiates discharge action. Otherwise, 12 TFW/CC
     makes recommendations to AFPC concerning reclassification and discharge of these
     officers.
AETCI36-2205V3 20 DECEMBER 2012                                                            13


  2.7. Student Dispositions:

  2.11. Student Eliminations:
     2.11.1. Eliminate students if they:
        2.11.1.1. Exhibit LOA, which is the inability to complete the course because of
        physical, psychological, or personality factors. LOA eliminees require an evaluation
        from both medical and rated personnel. This category includes airsickness and MOA.
        Annotate specific deficiencies in the remarks section of AETC Form 141.

        2.11.1.11. Demonstrate improper attitude or lack of responsibility toward assigned
        duties or obligations. This may include character disorders that raise doubt about the
        student’s fitness for continued service.
     2.11.2. The 12 FTW/CC authorizes a student’s elimination from IFS for misconduct
     which results in, or warrants, nonjudicial punishment. Based on the totality of the
     circumstances, 306 FTG/CC recommends whether a student should be eliminated from
     training. When misconduct is serious enough to warrant discharge from the service under
     AFI 36-3206, the responsible show cause authority initiates discharge action. Otherwise,
     12 FTW/CC makes recommendations to AFPC concerning reclassification and discharge
     of these officers.
  2.12. CR Records Distribution:
     2.12.1. The school registrar or designated authority:
        2.12.1.1. Maintains original CR records according to the Air Force RDS and

AETCI36-2205V3 20 DECEMBER 2012                                                             17


                                       Chapter 3.
                                  Medical Management
  3.1. Airsickness Procedures:
     3.1.1. Students must meet course training and MIF standards to continue flight
     screening. Grade them against the absolute rating scale, regardless of the effect of
     airsickness. During the first eight sorties, the instructor may change the profile,
     momentarily take control of the aircraft or, if necessary, terminate the mission to help
     students overcome the effects of airsickness. As students progress in screening,
     instructor assistance decreases.
     3.1.2. Civilian FLT/CCs, military FLT/CCs/MTOs, military supervisors, or instructors
     refer students who experience active airsickness (vomiting) or passive airsickness to the
     flight surgeon, aeromedical examiner, or medical technician for examination, counseling,
     and appropriate treatment as soon as practical and before the next flight. Airsickness
     medication or physiological adaptation with the Barany Chair or similar device is
     prohibited. Document episodes of airsickness on AF Form 4293 or a 306 FTG/CC-
     approved equivalent.
     3.1.3. While resolving airsickness problems, students continue the normal syllabus flow,
     including flying.
     3.1.4. Students who become airsick on a post-solo sortie receive an overall grade of
     unsatisfactory (U).
  3.2. Manifestation of Apprehension (MOA) Procedures. The squadron commander or
  civilian or military FLT/CC (MTO) requests a flight surgeon, aeromedical examiner, or
  medical technician examination for a student with MOA symptoms. If no psychological or
  physical problems are present, the student is deemed medically qualified for flying duties.
  The decision to eliminate a student for MOA reasons is an operational decision based on
  mission impairment and operational risk management. The squadron commander reviews
  the student’s training record and enters justification for recommending elimination for MOA.
  3.3. Medical Elimination:
     3.3.1. The IA, with the concurrence of the attending flight surgeon, aeromedical
     examiner, or medical technician, makes a recommendation for medical elimination
     (AETC Form 141). The RA recommends whether or not the student should be
     considered for reinstatement at a later date.
     3.3.2. Eliminate students placed in duty not including flying status or its equivalent for
     more than 5 days. The 1 FTS (Pueblo) or the student’s assigned unit (civilian flight
     school students) notifies 306 FTG/CC and AETC/FMAM, NGB/A3OC, or AFRC/A3T,
     as appropriate, as soon as the medical elimination status becomes probable. Under
     normal circumstances, students medically eliminated return to their AT base or
     permanent station until the medical condition is resolved and the student has been cleared
     through appropriate flight surgeon channels to return to flying
     3.3.3. If the medical condition is resolved, the 306 FTG/CC, in consultation with the
     student’s home-base commander, 1 FTS/CC, AETC/A3F, and AFPC/DPSIP,
     NGB/A3OC, or AFRC/A3T, as appropriate, determines where and when to reinstate the

     student in the screening program or what action to take (for example, course waiver).
     Record the 306 FTG/CC’s decision in the student’s training folder on an AF Form 4293
     or its 306 FTG/CC-approved equivalent. Reinstatement documentation is included in the
     student’s training folder.

                              Training Folders and Documentation
Section 4A—Applicable to IFS Students Screened at Pueblo, CO
Note: See Section 4B for civilian flight school students.
   4.1. Introduction. Student training folders are for the exclusive use of the student’s civilian
   and military FLT/CC/MTO, contractor supervisor, and immediate chain of command.
   Specify procedures in local unit guidance.
       4.1.1. All personnel must secure training folders and personal information folders to
       prevent unauthorized access.         Information affecting student screening that is
       inappropriate for public access or sensitive in nature is documented in this folder. The
       contractor approved for conducting formal training or maintaining training records must
       keep training folders in a secure location. When required, civilian and military
       FLT/CCs/MTOs or supervisors maintain personal information folders on students to
       protect information of a personal nature not appropriate for the training folder. A student
       may access only his or her training folder.
       4.1.2. Record each aircraft, academic, and ground training event in the training folder.
   4.2. Content. The following items are included in the training folder or TIMS/GTIMS, as
   applicable: (Note: AETC Forms 6 and 141 may be stored separately from the other folder
   items. The forms must be added to the other items when the student’s training folder is
   closed out.)
       4.2.1. AETC Form 101 (or 306 FTG/CC-approved equivalent).

       4.2.7. Student résumé.
       4.2.8. Summary of training.
   4.3. Documentation. Use AF Form 4293 (or 306 FTG/CC-approved equivalent) to
   document student training in the training folders. Instructors provide a concise summary of
   the student’s training and ensure entries clarify any training action. Begin each entry with
   the date, mission number (if applicable), and reason for the entry. End each entry with the
   signature, printed name, grade, and duty title of the instructor making the entry. The student
   and civilian FLT/CC initial all AF Form 4293 entries prior to the next syllabus-required
   event. Documentation is required for the following:
       4.3.1. Nonpermanent medical disqualification or medical hold.
       4.3.2. Failure of any academic test, category check, flight evaluation, PC, or EC.
       (Update AETC Form 101, if used.)
