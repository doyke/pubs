                                      INTRODUCTION

1.1. Program Management. This manual implements policy, assigns responsibility and
establishes procedures for motor vehicle traffic supervision on Air Force installations located in
the continental United States (CONUS), outside the continental United States (OCONUS), and
deployed locations, where implemented. This AFMAN provides additional Air Force specific
guidance to complement guidance found in AFI 31-218 (I). The objective of traffic control
programs is the safe and efficient flow of vehicles and pedestrians through reduction of factors
contributing to accidents.
1.2. Responsibilities. Installation Defense Force Commander (DFC). The DFC is the
Installation Commander's principal advisor on issues pertaining to the lawful movement of
personnel and traffic. The DFC exercises staff responsibility for directing, regulating and
controlling traffic, and enforcing installation rules pertaining to traffic control. DFCs assist
traffic engineers by performing traffic control studies to gather information on traffic problems
and use patterns.
1.3. Delegation of Authority. Installation commanders may delegate their responsibilities
under this manual to their vice commanders, mission support commanders or other group
commanders as appropriate and provided the individual does not occupy a position such as law
enforcement which would constitute a conflict of interest. Commanders should coordinate letters
of delegation through their SJAs.
1.3. (GOODFELLOWAFB) The 17th Training Wing Commander (17 TRW/CC)
delegates this authority to the 17th Mission Support Group Deputy Commander (17
MSG/CD). This authority is transferred to the 17th Mission Support Group Commander (17
MSG/CC) in the 17 MSG/CD’s absence.

                                            Chapter 2

                                   DRIVING PRIVILEGES

2.1. Requirements for Driving Privileges. Each Installation Commander will determine if
international driver’s licenses will be recognized and authorized for use on the installation. Take
into consideration the local (civilian) jurisdiction’s policy on recognition and acceptance of
international driver’s licenses. As a general rule, most CONUS civilian jurisdictions will honor
use of international driver’s licenses for short periods of time by non-resident visitors and
assigned military personnel and dependents. When practical, Installation Commanders should
incorporate local guidance to prevent conflicts and confusion.
2.1. (GOODFELLOWAFB) State issued driver’s license or identification cards are
acceptable proof of identification for civilians and contractors. The use of international
driver’s license on the installation is authorized for non-US resident personnel. Personnel
returning to the state of Texas with an overseas command driver’s licenses or expired Texas state
licenses have 90 days from the date of entry into the state of Texas to obtain a valid Texas
license.
2.2. Stopping and Inspecting Personnel or Vehicles.
     2.2.1. AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, and AFI 10-245, Antiterrorism, require Installation
     Commanders to develop instructions and guidance that detail stop, inspection, search and
     impoundment of motor vehicles at CONUS installation entry gates, to include Air Force
     restricted and controlled areas.
     2.2.2. MAJCOMs responsible for overseas military installations must provide their
     Installation Commanders with written guidelines governing stop, inspection, search and
     impoundment of vehicles. This guidance must reflect host nation agreements and pass
     appropriate legal review. Note: A combatant commander or those commanding unified forces
     may direct guidance covering all installations under their command. In this case, MAJCOMs
     must review those policies before issuing their guidance.
2.3. Implied Consent to Blood, Breath or Urine Tests. This requirement must be outlined as
part of installation newcomers briefings and/or inprocessing of newly assigned personnel. Refer
to AFI 31-218 (I) for specific information.
2.4. Implied Consent to Vehicle Impoundment. In addition to those conditions for
impoundment listed in AFI 31-218(I), paragraph 2-3, local situations may arise that require
impoundment. The determination will be made by the Installation Commander or designee.
Installation and unit commanders must view the abandonment of personal property as a
personnel management issue and be diligent in deterring occurrences. Commanders must include
the consequences when personal property is abandoned during familiarization and indoctrination
training into units. Additionally, measures must be established to ensure personal effects are
cleared prior to personnel departing on permanent change-of-station orders.
2.5. Suspension or Revocation of Driving Privileges. Installation Commanders must
incorporate procedures governing suspension and revocation in base publications or as a
supplement to this instruction. Make these known to the base population. AF will follow the
administrative due process for suspensions detailed in AFI 31-218(I).
AFMAN31-116_GOODFELLOWAFBSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013                                                   7


  2.5.1. Suspensions.
     2.5.1.1. Installation Commanders determine suspension and revocation guidance for non-
     moving violations, as well as what constitutes a non-moving violation on their
     installation (i.e., performing unauthorized repair; failure to register and insure vehicles;
     unauthorized modifications or alterations; failure to maintain safety standards, etc).
     Make these standards part of the local installation traffic code and take reasonable steps
     to make them known to the general public.
     2.5.1.2. Persons under the age of 21, when in the United States or where legal alcohol
     consumption age is 21, operating a motor vehicle with a BAC or BrAC level standard of
     .01 or higher is reason for automatic suspension. Refer to AFI 31-218(I) 2-
     4.a.(3).(a).(b).(c).(d). for additional guidance.
     2.5.1.2. (GOODFELLOWAFB) Minors operating a motor vehicle under the influence
     of any detectable amount of alcohol in their system will be considered driving under the
     influence.
     2.5.1.3. The .08 blood alcohol limit for presumptive intoxication determination may be
     reduced to reflect a more stringent local, state or host nation standard.
     2.5.1.3. (GOODFELLOWAFB) Suspension of driving privileges may be imposed for
     driving under the influence incidents even though the driver’s blood alcohol limit is
     below the legal BAC limit (.08). The 17 MSG/CD will make a determination on the
     individual’s impairment of normal faculties if the driver is rendered incapable of safely
     operating a motor vehicle.
  2.5.2. Revocation.
     2.5.2.1. The Installation Commander will immediately revoke driving privileges for a
     period of not less than 1 year when a serious incident involving a motor vehicle occurs
     and the Installation Commander determines immediate revocation of driving privileges is
     required to preserve public safety or the good order and discipline of military personnel.
     2.5.2.2. The DFC develops plans and procedures to forward revocation, suspension and
     driving records to gaining commanders and to initiate appropriate staff action when
     receiving similar records from losing commanders of inbound personnel.
     2.5.2.3. Installation Commanders may impose multiple suspensions to run consecutively
     or concurrently.
     2.5.2.3. (GOODFELLOWAFB) The 17 MSG/CD may impose multiple suspensions to
     run consecutively for a total of 24 months.
     2.5.2.4. (Added-GOODFELLOWAFB) Suspension of driving privileges imposed
     from another installation/service component and that are still in effect will be coordinated
     through 17th Security Forces Squadron Commander (17 SFS/CC), 17th Training Wing
     Judge Advocate (17 TRW/JA), and 17 MSG/CD to determine if the suspension will
     remain in effect at Goodfellow AFB. The 17th Security Forces Squadron will notify the
     17 LRS Operator Records and Licensing Office when individuals have their driving
     privileges suspended, revoked, or reinstated. Individuals who have their driving
     privileges suspended or revoked must return their AF Form 2293, US Air Force Motor
 8                            AFMAN31-116_GOODFELLOWAFBSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013


        Vehicle Operator Identification Card, to the Operator and Licensing Section according to
        AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations.
        2.5.2.5. (Added-GOODFELLOWAFB) The 17 MSG/CD will conduct evidence
        review of suspension/revocations no later than 3 days following completion of final
        assembly of evidence.
        2.5.2.6. (Added-GOODFELLOWAFB) Personnel whose driving privileges have been
        suspended or revoked have 10 duty days from the date of suspension to request an
        administrative hearing. Administrative hearings will be held within 10 duty days before
        the 17 MSG/CD, 17 TRW/JA, and 17 SFS/CC (Traffic Review Board).
        2.5.2.7. (Added-GOODFELLOWAFB) Personnel with suspended or revoked driving
        privileges may request partial or restricted driving privileges. Only extreme hardships or
        other workable alternatives will be considered. All requests must be in writing through
        the 17 SFS/CC to 17 MSG/CD.
2.6. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Programs. After coordination with the SJA, unit commanders
will direct drug and/or alcohol testing within 24 hours of suspected alcohol related motor
vehicle/traffic incidents or misconduct, episodes of aberrant or bizarre behavior or where there is
reasonable suspicion of drug use and the member refuses to provide consent for testing.
Commanders are also encouraged to ensure Blood Alcohol Tests (BAT) are taken as soon after
the incident as possible to determine the level and intensity of alcohol involvement. For
additional information refer to AFI 31-218(I).
     2.6.1. (Added-GOODFELLOWAFB) All drug and alcohol related incident reports will be
     forwarded to the Mental Health Clinic (17 MDOS/SGOH) for referral and evaluation
     purposes.
     2.6.2. (Added-GOODFELLOWAFB) Security Forces will use the blood alcohol
     concentration (BAC) chemical test through the extraction of blood to determine the degree of
     alcohol impairment or intoxication.

           PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLE OPERATION REQUIREMENTS

3.1. General. The Installation Commander will identify requirements to operate a motor
vehicle on the installation.
3.2. Motorcycles, Motor Scooters and Mopeds. See AFI 91-207, The US Air Force Traffic
Safety Program, for requirements to operate motorcycles, motor scooters and mopeds on AF
installations. Refer to AFI 91-207, para 4.6., for motorcycle training requirements.
   3.2.1. (Added-GOODFELLOWAFB) All military personnel at any time, on or off an AF
   installation, and all AF civilian personnel in a duty status on an AF installation or off an
   installation who operate a motorcycle on a roadway, and all operators of government owned
   motorcycles, are required to attend and complete a Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF)
   approved safety course prior to riding on or off base. Those seeking to become motorcycle
   operators on roadways must comply with the skills training, permit and license requirements
   of state, territory, host nation or applicable Status of Forces agreements. The 17 SFS will
   conduct random MSF checks on motorcycle riders to ensure they meet base requirements.
   3.2.2. (Added-GOODFELLOWAFB) Active-duty military members who have not
   completed an MSF course may park motorcycles on base, provided the motorcycle is
   otherwise properly registered and insured.
   3.2.3. (Added-GOODFELLOWAFB) Individuals (regardless of affiliation) requesting
   entry to the base to attend a scheduled motorcycle safety course may be permitted to proceed,
   provided they meet safety requirements contained in paragraph 3.2.4, possess a valid
   motorcycle driver’s license, and meet vehicle insurance requirements. Individuals not
   affiliated with the DoD will be sponsored by a letter from 17 TRW/SE and issued an AF IMT
   75, Visitor/Vehicle Pass, DBIDS Access Card, or DBIDS Pass not to exceed 12 hours or
   length of contract work.
   3.2.4. (Added-GOODFELLOWAFB) As stated in DoDI 6055.04, all personnel (operators
   and passengers) must wear the following PPE on the installation: A helmet properly fastened
   under the chin (certified to meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 218, United
   Nations Economic Commission for Europe Standard 22-05, British Standard 6658, or Snell
   Standard M2005); protective clothing which includes long-sleeved shirt or jacket, long
   trousers, and full-fingered gloves or mittens made from leather or other abrasion-resistant
   material; foot protection which includes sturdy over-the-ankle footwear that affords
   protection for the feet and ankles (durable leather or ballistic-type cloth athletic shoes that
   cover the ankles may be worn); eye protection which is designed to meet or exceed American
   National Standards Institute Standard Z87.1-2003 for impact and shatter resistance includes
   goggles, wraparound glasses, or a full-face shield properly attached to a helmet (a windshield
   or fairing does not constitute eye protection). Motorcycles/mopeds must have headlights on
   while in operation and have a rearview mirror attached to each side of the vehicle.
   3.2.5. (Added-GOODFELLOWAFB) Air Force personnel will wear a brightly colored
   upper garment as an outer garment during the day. Outer upper garment shall be visible and
   not covered. US Air Force and Navy personnel will wear a retro-reflective upper garment or
   vest during the night. Wearing a backpack is authorized if it has high visibility colors/high
 10                           AFMAN31-116_GOODFELLOWAFBSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013


   visibility reflective properties or does not obscure the high visibility and reflectivity of the
   rider's upper garment.
3.3. AF Form 75, Visitor/Vehicle Pass. The Security Forces Management Information System
(SFMIS), the Defense Biometric Identification System (DBIDS) generated vehicle/visitor passes
or the AF Form 75 are methods to control and identify personnel and vehicles on a temporary
basis. Specific procedures can be found in AFI 31-201, Security Forces Standards and
Procedures, and AFI 31-113, Installation Perimeter Access Control, when implemented.
   3.3.1. (Added-GOODFELLOWAFB) Entry controllers may issue a 72-hour DBIDS pass
   to contractors working on base when properly sponsored. These operators will be authorized
   to drive on base, provided they have a valid motorcycle driver’s license and valid proof of
   insurance. Pass and Registration officials may extend the pass to the length of their contract
   providing the pass does not exceed 1 year. Contractors are required to comply with safety
   requirements per AFI 91-207, US Air Force Traffic Safety Program. Refer contractors to
   Pass and Registration for passes exceeding 72-hour periods.
   3.3.2. (Added-GOODFELLOWAFB) Contractor employees are encouraged to use
   contractor vehicles instead of personal vehicles. Proof of insurance, vehicle registration, and
   current driver’s licenses are required for each vehicle to be registered on base. All
   contractors may be issued an AF IMT 75, DBIDS Access card, or DBIDS pass for up to 1
   year. Additionally, they may be issued an AF IMT 75A for their vehicle, provided
   installation registration requirements are met. Initial issue and renewal of identification
   media and registration will be coordinated with 17th Contracting Squadron and/or the
   sponsoring agency. The approval authority and project manager must have a DD Form 577,
   Signature Card, on file with Pass and Registration.
3.4. Handicapped Person Identification. Honor local and state-issued handicap decals,
placards, signs, etc, on all Air Force installations. Upon request from a medical practitioner,
Installation Commanders may authorize issue of a locally devised card or form in OCONUS or
deployed locations where decals are not issued. Locally devised decals will contain an issue and
expiration date and be issued and displayed per local procedures.
3.4. (GOODFELLOWAFB) Local and state issued handicap decals, placards, license
plates, and signs are used on Goodfellow AFB. Blue disabled person identification placards
may park in blue color-coded parking spaces or in any other disabled parking spaces. Personnel
with a short-term or temporary disability must display their placard from the rearview mirror.
3.5. Vehicle Registration at non Air Force Installations. Personnel who live or work on a
DoD Installation or who often use the facilities therein, may be required to register and be issued
a DD Form 2220, Vehicle Decal, for their vehicles at those locations.
3.6. Vehicle Registration at Air Force Installations. Personnel who possess appropriate
credentials to access Air Force Installations do not require a DD Form 2220. Although AFI 31-
218(I) requires vehicle registration, the Air Force was granted a waiver from this requirement.
Air Force Installations who continue to utilize the DD Form 2220 will use AFI 31-218(I) for
guidance and include any specific requirements for their location in the local traffic plan. The
Air Force will no longer produce DD Form 2220.
AFMAN31-116_GOODFELLOWAFBSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013                                                      11


                                            Chapter 4

                             TRAFFIC PLANNING AND CODES

4.1. Installation Traffic Codes.
   4.1.1. Restraint systems.
       4.1.1.1. Require the use of child safety seats consistent with state, territory or host nation
       laws. If there is no state, territory or host nation law, all children under 4 years of age
       regardless of weight or less than 50 pounds regardless of age shall be properly secured in
       an appropriate child restraint system. Children ages 4 through 7, weighing 50 pounds or
       more and less than 4 feet 9 inches shall be properly secured in a booster seat or other
       appropriate child restraint system. Children ages 8 and above and no less than 4 feet 9
       inches in height will be properly secured in a vehicle seat belt or booster seat. The child
       safety seat or booster seat will be certified by the manufacturer to meet all applicable
       Federal performance standards or host nation requirements and will be installed in
       accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
       4.1.1.2. All drivers and passengers on Air Force installations will wear seat belts, or in
       the case of infants, be properly restrained.
       4.1.1.2. (GOODFELLOWAFB) Operators and passengers of all vehicles operated on
       all Air Force installations must properly wear restraint systems regardless of seating
       position. All active duty military and reserve component members on active duty will
       properly wear restraint systems regardless of seating position on and off military
       installations.
   4.1.2. Radar Detection Devices. The use of radars or laser detection devices are prohibited
   on Air Force Installations.
   4.1.3. Off-road vehicle usage: Installation Commanders or their designee determines if,
   when and where off-road vehicles may be operated on base. In many areas, the operation of
   off-road vehicles is unregulated while other jurisdictions have strict requirements concerning
   age, safety training and vehicle equipment. Generally, some "on-street" safety practices such
   as reflective vests, gloves, headlights and goggles may not apply when operating off road in a
   recreational capacity. However, ensure full compliance with local, state or host nation
   requirements. When necessary, develop additional procedures and guidance locally and
   publish in the installation traffic safety plan or supplement to this instruction. Ensure
   environmental considerations are reviewed prior to designating any off-road vehicle use area.
4.2. Traffic Accident Investigation.
   4.2.1. A major traffic accident is any accident involving a fatality, injury or property damage
   above the amount established by Installation Commanders. Installation Commanders may set
   differing amounts for government versus private vehicle and property damage. Monetary
   damage amounts for major accidents are typically $10,000. The investigation of major
   accidents should be accomplished by a trained accident investigator. MAJCOMs will
   determine the level of training required.
 12                          AFMAN31-116_GOODFELLOWAFBSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013


   4.2.1. (GOODFELLOWAFB) Major vehicle accidents consist of one or more of the
   following: fatality, any complaint of or visible injury, regardless of whether medical
   attention is sought (bruises, contusions, cuts, scrapes, compression, or any other visible
   damage to the body). Private or government vehicle or property damage exceeding $10,000,
   a vehicle damaged where it cannot be moved under its own power (has to be towed) or hard
   to explain circumstances.
   4.2.2. Generally, a detailed accident investigation includes, but is not limited to, an AF Form
   1315, Accident Report, field sketch, scale diagram (if death or serious bodily harm), and
   accident narrative.
4.3. Traffic Accident Investigation Reports.
   4.3.1. Military members report information to Security Forces if they are on/off base
   resulting in accidents involving injuries or damage to military property. Local guidance will
   capture procedures to accomplish these notifications and the timeframes to report.
   Installation Commanders determine what agencies to notify and for what type of accidents to
   notify them. The DFC must develop a local notification matrix or other procedures to ensure
   proper notification of appropriate base and civilian agencies are conducted. Develop and
   publish these notification procedures locally.
   4.3.2. Security Forces will act as the focal point for gathering off-base accident information
   of military affiliated personnel. Record the information in the Security Forces blotter, along
   with the associated case number from the investigating police agency. When possible,
   Security Forces Reports and Analysis (S5R) will obtain copies of major accident reports
   prepared by investigating civilian police agencies to accompany off-base accident reporting
   information.
   4.3.3. Security Forces respond to all on-base major vehicle accidents (unless local conditions
   or policies prohibit) to accomplish the following:
   4.3.3. (GOODFELLOWAFB) Security Forces will respond to all on-base traffic accidents.
   Accomplish GOODFELLOWAFB Form 4, Security Forces Minor Accident Worksheet, for
   all minor accidents.
       4.3.3.1. Render first aid and arrange for medical assistance.
       4.3.3.2. Protect personal property.
       4.3.3.3. Normalize traffic.
       4.3.3.4. Identify witnesses and personnel involved.
       4.3.3.5. Conduct a formal investigation.
       4.3.3.6. The DFC (with Installation Commander approval) will develop local response
       and investigative procedures for various types of accidents to include minor vehicle
       accidents. S/He may delegate this authority to on-duty Security Forces supervisory
       personnel.
   4.3.4. Record accident information in the Security Forces blotter. This information should
   include the accident type, time and date, location, name(s) of vehicle operator(s), unit (or
   address when civilian not affiliated with military), vehicle description and license
AFMAN31-116_GOODFELLOWAFBSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013                                                   13


   number(s)/plate. Also, include a brief summary of any damage and circumstances behind or
   causing the accident, as well as any traffic citations issued.
      4.3.4.1. (Added-GOODFELLOWAFB) Copies of both minor and major accident
      reports are forwarded to the17th Training Wing Safety Office for trend analysis. Data is
      then distributed to authorized agencies by the Safety Office.
   4.3.5. Investigation conducted by Security Forces and/or AFOSI of any traffic accident will
   take precedence over any other types of investigations relating to the accident. This
   precludes the loss of any potential evidence that may later have to be introduced in any
   criminal/judicial proceedings. (Example: Any safety related investigation and/or any other
   investigation that may hamper accident investigation practices by Security Forces and/or
   AFOSI.)
4.4. Parking.
   4.4.1. Reserved Parking. When not addressed by MAJCOMs, Installation Commanders
   determine reserved parking guidance for their installations. Number of available spaces,
   facility design and layout, traffic flow and number of vehicles using facilities will help
   determine the number and location of reserved parking spaces. Make guidance and
   procedures governing reserved parking a part of the installation supplement to this
   instruction, separate traffic control instruction or installation-parking plan. The publication
   must address approval, issue, control and review of reserved parking and should give special
   consideration to bicycle, motorcycle, visitor and car pool parking. Consideration should also
   be given to labor and management contracts when designating parking. Handicap parking is
   regulated under the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards and applies to all Air Force
   installations.
   4.4.2. Use distinctive emblems, decals, stickers, etc, to control parking space assignments
   and to indicate authorized use of the parking slot. MAJCOMs (or Installation Commanders if
   not addressed by the MAJCOM) may develop guidance concerning the issue and control of
   the identification media discussed above. Designation of parking spaces by name, grade, rank
   or title should be avoided due to force protection concerns.
   4.4.3. Installations may create a parking wardens program to monitor and cite parking
   violators at their facilities.
   4.4.3. (GOODFELLOWAFB) Parking Warden Program. The parking warden program is
   utilized on Goodfellow Air Force Base as follows:
      4.4.3.1. If utilized, installations will develop a local publication to
      supplement/implement this instruction addressing the parking warden program. The
      supplement will include a requirement for individual unit commanders to delegate a
      minimum of one primary and alternate at the grade of E-5 or above, in writing. All
      monitors will issue parking tickets on the DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket.
      S5R will obtain a letter with the current monitors and maintain the letter on file.
      4.4.3.1. (GOODFELLOWAFB) Individual unit commanders may delegate traffic
      wardens, in writing, for participation in the parking warden program. The 17 SFS/S5R
      will obtain a letter from the current monitor, signed by the parking warden unit
 14                          AFMAN31-116_GOODFELLOWAFBSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013


       commanders and maintain the letter on file. The letter should specify one primary and
       one alternate (up to five alternates) in the grade of E-5 or above.
       4.4.3.2. Monitors will be trained by the Security Forces unit on the correct procedures to
       complete tickets, including the routing process of issued tickets to S5R. The main
       difference between a DD Form 1408 issued by a Security Forces member and one by a
       parking monitor is the special instructions on the back of the pink copy that directs the
       violator to contact the monitor within 24 hours or next duty day who issued the ticket
       instead of Security Forces. Monitors will provide contact information on parking tickets
       to enable violators to provide information necessary to complete the citation.
       4.4.3.2. (GOODFELLOWAFB) The 17 SFS/S5R will train monitors on issuing
       parking tickets for parking-related offenses only. Parking wardens will only utilize the
       DD Form 1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket. The 17 SFS/S5R will properly document
       parking warden training via a Memorandum For Record (MFR). The MFR will be
       maintained in the 17 SFS/S5R traffic warden continuity book.
       4.4.3.3. (Added-GOODFELLOWAFB) Monitors will be trained by 17 SFS/S5R on
       the correct way to complete tickets. The primary difference between a DD Form 1408
       issued by a security forces member and one by a parking monitor is the special
       instructions on the back of the pink copy that directs the violator to contact the monitor
       who issued the ticket instead of the usual Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC). It is
       important that monitors include how or where they can be reached by the violators.
       When contacted by the violator, the monitor will fill in any pertinent missing data in
       sections 1-10. Once the DD Form 1408 is completed, the monitor will give 17 SFS/S5R
       the white and yellow copies to be processed.
       4.4.3.4. (Added-GOODFELLOWAFB) Tickets that are incomplete or were written by
       personnel not designated as parking wardens will not be processed and will be returned to
       the unit. Parking wardens will only issue tickets for areas under the control of their
       commander.
4.5. Off-installation Traffic Activities. The DFC must develop procedures for the sharing and
exchanging of information with civil authorities. Local procedures must cover the receiving,
processing and securing of traffic and related incident reports received from other investigative
agencies. Unit commanders will be notified when personnel under their authority are involved in
serious off-base incidents (i.e., major accidents, DUI, hit and run, etc).
   4.5.1. (Added-GOODFELLOWAFB) All incident and accident reports received from non-
   military agencies will be handled in the same manner as military reports. All military
   accident and incident reports will be provided to law enforcement and investigative agencies
   per AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program.

                DRIVING RECORDS AND THE TRAFFIC POINT SYSTEM

5.1. Driving Records. Use SFMIS to record vehicle traffic accidents, moving and parking
violations, suspension or revocation actions and traffic point assessments involving military and
DoD civilian personnel, their family members and other personnel operating motor vehicles on a
military installation. Use AF Form 1313, Driver Record, when SFMIS is not available. When
filling out the form, use the following codes in the “accident classification” block:
   5.1.1. Identify individuals who are principals in a motor vehicle accident as “Driver 1”
   subject or “Driver 2” victim.
   5.1.2. Identify accidents appropriately with “MVA” minor vehicle accident; (MJVA) major
   vehicle accident; “NLD” no liability determined; “PD” property damage; “PI” personal
   injury; “G” government; “P” private; “V” vehicle; and “FO” fixed object.

      may reach dangerous levels, keys left accessible to children or where conditions are
      deemed hazardous by a reasonable person.
      5. Emergency vehicles are authorized to park in any area deemed necessary to affect a
      response.

5.2. Point System Procedures.
   5.2.1. Distribute citation copies and process point assessments IAW AFMAN 31-201,
   Volume 7, Security Forces Reports and Analysis.
   5.2.2. Installation Commanders may suspend or revoke driving privileges as provided by this
   instruction regardless of whether the improvement measures identified in AFI 31-218(I) are
   accomplished.
   5.2.3. (Added-GOODFELLOWAFB) Accumulation of 12 points in a 12-month period
   will result in a 6-month suspension and 18 points in a 24-month period will result in a 1 year
   revocation.
5.3. Disposition of Driving Records. Follow AFI 33-364, Records Disposition – Procedures
and Responsibilities, to maintain and destroy records of military personnel released from active
duty. Driving records remain active in the case of immediate reenlistment, change of officer
component or military and civilian retirement or when continued access to an installation is
authorized. Retain or destroy according to AFI 33-364 records on civilian personnel who are
terminating on-base employment.

                                            Chapter 6

                     IMPOUNDING PRIVATELY OWNED VEHICLES

6.1. Standards for Impoundment. The on-duty SF Flight Chief, or above, will determine
when the vehicle will be driven or moved without owner’s consent if the owner cannot be
contacted or the owner refuses and conditions in AFI 31-218(I) are present.
6.2. Procedures for Impoundment. At times, civilian law enforcement or civilian government
agencies will request the Air Force impound an on-base vehicle for reasons not related to
military issues. Staff such requests through the SJA and DFC. When appropriate, comply and
support such requests and impound the vehicle for a reasonable period. Release the vehicle if
civil authorities do not take custody of the vehicle within a reasonable period as determined by
Installation Commanders.
   6.2.1. (Added-GOODFELLOWAFB) The 17 SFS will arrange to tow and impound any
   vehicle which interferes with traffic, threatens public safety or convenience, is involved with
   criminal activity, contains evidence of criminal activity, or is stolen or abandoned. 17 SFS
   will impound vehicles utilized in a crime and will be treated as evidence.
   6.2.2. (Added-GOODFELLOWAFB) Impoundment of vehicles is inappropriate if other
   alternatives exist. The 17 SFS will attempt to make contact with the owner of the vehicle
   prior to impounding. Conspicuously place a DD Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice, on
   a vehicle suspected to be abandoned and annotate this in the desk blotter. Allow the owner 3
   days after the vehicle is tagged to remove the vehicle prior to impounding. After the 3-day
   waiting period, accomplish a DD Form 2505, Abandoned Vehicle Removal Authorization,
   and impound the vehicle.
6.3. Disposition of Vehicles After Impoundment. Impoundment and disposition of privately
owned vehicles is a high-risk process. It is imperative an installation have a detailed plan to:
Ensure wide publicity of base impoundment rules; have a process to provide reasonable notice of
impoundment and an opportunity to reclaim a vehicle; conduct a review of proposed disposal by
appropriate base offices, to include the SJA, prior to taking action; and a process to obtain retail
records of these actions in the event of litigation or high-level inquiry. Further information on
impoundment can be found in AFI 31-218(I).
   6.3.1. (Added-GOODFELLOWAFB) During its impoundment, accomplish an inventory
   of the vehicle. Annotate the finding on the DD Form 2506, Vehicle Impoundment Report.
   Send the last-known owner, via certified mail, a copy of the DD Form 2505; DD Form 2506;
   DD Form 2507, Notice of Vehicle Impoundment; and a memorandum of intent to dispose of
   the vehicle.
   6.3.2. (Added-GOODFELLOWAFB) Retain the abandoned vehicle for 60 days from the
   date the memorandum is received by the last-known owner. After 60 days, treat the vehicle
   as acquired property unless the owner has notified S2I of intentions.

                                   TRAFFIC FLOW PLAN

A2.1. (GOODFELLOWAFB) Purpose. This plan details the peak periods of traffic on
Goodfellow AFB and the buildings or areas where the majority of traffic flows.
A2.2. (GOODFELLOWAFB) General Information. Goodfellow AFB is within the city
limits of San Angelo, Texas, a city with a population of approximately 90,000 people.
Goodfellow AFB has approximately 15,200 privately owned vehicles and the installation
operates 24 hours a day with traffic flowing through two gates: The North Gate operating
Monday - Friday, 0600-1800, and the Jacobson Gate operating 24 hours, 7 days a week. Both
gates are located on Kearney Boulevard. Peak periods usually run from 0700 - 0730 and 1630 -
1700 during normal duty days. Both gates experience traffic congestion during inbound (a.m.)
and outbound (p.m) periods.
A2.3. (GOODFELLOWAFB) General Rules for Vehicle Operators. All persons will drive
vehicles on base at the posted speed limit or at a lesser speed that is reasonable under existing
weather and/or road conditions. Speed limits on base, with the exception of parking lots (10
MPH) and Goodfellow Housing Area (10 MPH), are 25 MPH unless otherwise posted.
A2.4. (GOODFELLOWAFB) Organizations. Organizations sponsoring activities or special
events on base should coordinate traffic control measures with security forces at least 72 hours in
advance of the event. Base Access Letters (BALs) will be processed through Pass and
Registration at least 72 hours prior to an event being held. BALs must have, as a minimum, the
visitor’s full name, date of birth, driver’s license number and/or social security number, vehicle
make, model and license plate number, date of visit, reason for visit, duration of visit, and be
signed by the POC for the event.

                           GOODFELLOW AFB TRAFFIC CODE

A3.1. (GOODFELLOWAFB) Local laws. Title 18, Section 13 of the U.S. Code assimilates
Texas law regarding traffic enforcement on Goodfellow AFB, except when it conflicts with an
AF directive or this supplement. These rules apply to everyone operating a vehicle and to
pedestrians on this base.
A3.2. (GOODFELLOWAFB) Low beams. During hours of darkness or when visibility has
decreased due to inclement weather (i.e., snow, rain, fog, wind storm, or hail), vehicle operators
will use low beam headlights while on base. When entering the base, change to parking lights
and use low beam headlights when departing the base.
A3.3. (GOODFELLOWAFB) Children in unattended vehicle. Children under the age of 12
will not be left unattended in a car without adult supervision. In no case will any child be left in
a car that is running or with keys accessible inside the car to the child. Leaving a child
unattended will result in the violator being cited, possible apprehension/detention, and an
incident report being forwarded to the unit commander, Family Advocacy, and/or Texas
Department of Protective and Regulatory Services.
A3.4. (GOODFELLOWAFB) Parking on base. Parking on Goodfellow AFB is authorized
only in properly marked spaces, exceptions; Scherz Boulevard, Kickapoo Trail, and Fort Concho
Drive from Mitchell Street intersection to the softball field parking lot. Other prohibited areas
are:
   A3.4.1. (GOODFELLOWAFB) Within 15 feet of a building, unless marked parking
   spaces exist. Exceptions are granted for delivery vehicles so long as they do not impede the
   flow of traffic, or promote a safety hazard.
   A3.4.2. (GOODFELLOWAFB) Within 15 feet of a trash receptacle, so as to impede
   access or prevent pickup.
   A3.4.3. (GOODFELLOWAFB) In a manner that will block fire lanes.
   A3.4.4. (GOODFELLOWAFB) Backwards into marked diagonal parking spaces facing
   oncoming one-way traffic, except emergency vehicles. Emergency vehicle operators will use

   A3.4.8. (GOODFELLOWAFB) Motorcycles may park in standard automobile slots,
   designated motorcycle parking slots, or in the lined-out portion of striped parking lots, i.e.,
   end caps, provided the motorcycle does not impede the safe flow of traffic, or promote a
   safety hazard.
   A3.4.9. (GOODFELLOWAFB) Within 25 feet of an intersection. Exceptions are granted
   for delivery vehicles so long as they do not impede the flow of traffic, or promote a safety
   hazard.
