INTRODUCTION
A5.4. The Air Force supply chain has many different modes of transportation, handling systems
and storage equipment. Many packaged items are lost, mislabeled or frustrated because of
illegible, inadequate or improper markings. Marking and labeling requirements are the same for
all military shipments, but their application may vary depending on the type of container and
where or how it is being shipped.            This training template reemphasizes applicable
policy/guidance on reusable container reuse and marking obliteration to avoid misdirected,
improperly marked or lost shipments.


METHODOLOGY

CFR, ICAO/IATA, etc.).
A5.9.2.2. 49 CFR, PART 178, Specifications for Packaging applies to containers fabricated to
Department of Transportation (DOT) specifications and United Nations (UN) standards. This
applies to containers fabricated within the United States. There are numerous types of containers
that can be utilized to ship hazardous cargo and the following paragraphs specify standards for
each type of container:
A5.9.2.3. 49 CFR, Subpart C, 178.35-178.178.75, Specification for Cylinders, provides
mandatory standards for manufacturing, testing and usage of cylinders.

A5.10.1. Air Force Reusable Container Program.
A5.10.1.1. The Air Force maintains a Reusable Container Program. The program was
established to (1) reduce packaging and packing cost, (2) increase the reuse and availability of
containers, (3) improve asset protection, and (4) increase resource conservation. It is important
that attention be given to the reclamation, reuse and conservation of wooden containers,
fiberboard boxes and other reusable containers. Each Air Force installation shall operate an
active container reclamation program to allow the maximum availability and reuse of SPI
containers and other reusable containers (Fast Packs and Standard Packs) and packaging
materials used to package reparable and recoverable items. In the interest of conservation it is
just good practice to reuse packaging material for the shipment of Air Force assets as long as the
packaging materials meet the requirements of serviceability identified above and presents no
safety hazard to personnel required to transport, handle, or store assets. Negligence in discarding
SPI containers in refuse (trash) receptacles results in unnecessary procurement, unnecessary
fabrication of the same SPI container, unnecessary reimbursable actions to repack and premature
disposal of containers. Container losses slow down the flow of aircraft parts. Additional
policy/guidance on this program can be found in AFI 24-203.
A5.10.2. Packaging Training.
A5.10.2.1. School of Military Packaging Technology (SMPT). SMPT, U.S. Army Defense
Ammunition Center (USADAC), McAlister, OK, provides military packaging training. Training

A5.10.2.2. Defense Acquisition University (DAU). DAU has numerous Acquisition,
Technology & Logistics (AT&L) Continuous Learning Modules (CLM). The DOD Packaging
Module, CLL013, will allow personnel involved in the Packaging, Handling, Storage and
Transportation (PHS&T) process to obtain sufficient knowledge of the value of PHS&T
throughout its lifecycle. Visit the DAU web site at: https://learn.test.dau.mil.
A5.10.2.3. Hazardous Materials Training. AFMAN 24-204(I), Attachment 25, identifies
training requirements for all levels of hazardous materials workers who may affect the safety and
security of hazardous materials in transportation. Training requirements are based on functional
groups and the minimum training for handlers, packers, inspectors, technical specialist and
preparers are listed in the attachment.
A5.10.2.4. Hazardous Materials Computer Based Training (CBT). The CBT program was
developed by a joint cooperation between the US Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency
