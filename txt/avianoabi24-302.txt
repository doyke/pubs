1. Management:
   1.1. The purpose of this program is to deter vehicle accidents and abuse, which jeopardizes lives and
   drains our limited resources. Commander emphasis and direct involvement is essential to the pro-
   gram's success.

2. The Program:
   2.1. Responsibilities: All units assigned, attached to or associated with the 31st Fighter Wing will
   ensure compliance with this instruction.
   2.2. Objective: Reduce number of vehicle accidents and abuses, protect Air Force personnel from
   injury and/or death and reduce or eliminate unnecessary expenditure of limited monetary resources.
   The ultimate goal of this program is to eliminate vehicle accidents and/or abuses at Aviano.

    2.3. General: The base vehicle maintenance function is funded and staffed to provide preventive peri-
    odic maintenance and repairs due to fair wear and tear, but not for accident and abuse repairs. Money
    to repair accident and abuse damage must be taken from using organization funds.
       2.3.1. The keys to successfully reducing the number of accidents and abuses are to encourage
       commanders to maintain high standards of vehicle operator training and discipline and to make
       base personnel aware of the high costs associated with accident and abuse cases repair. Simply
       stated: "If you break it, you pay for it."
       2.3.2. Scheduled inspections and maintenance are the only way the 31st Logistics Readiness
       Squadron Vehicle Maintenance Element (31 LRS/LGRVM) can ensure a safe and serviceable
       vehicle fleet. These inspections are time-critical and must be completed at certain intervals to meet
       manufacturer and Air Force serviceability criteria. Therefore, overdue vehicles, vehicles not
       turned into 31 LRS/LGRVM for scheduled maintenance on or before their assigned appointment
       dates, will be considered vehicle abuse cases when turned in and may be processed in that manner.
       2.3.3. The using unit’s Commander will use their squadron funds to pay for repairs attributed to
       accident or abuse for vehicles operated by their personnel, to include U-Drive-It vehicles. Govern-
       ment Purchase Card payments are required upon request or upon repair completion. If payment
       has not been received, the vehicle will remain at the contractor incurring additional storage
       charges unless an appeal has been filed. The 31 LRS Commander (delegated to the 31 LRS Oper-
       ations Officer) will contact the owning organization’s commander/resource adviser if timely pay-
       ment is not made.

3. Procedures:
    3.1. All Government Owned Vehicles (GOV) involved in an accident, or found to have damage not
    previously reported (Abuse/Incident), must be turned into the 31 LRS/LGRVM as soon as possible,
    but no later than the next duty day, so the damage assessment and initial repair cost estimate can be
    accomplished.
       3.1.1. IAW AFI 24-301 and this instruction, a Standard Form 91, Motor Vehicle Accident Report,
       and DD Form 518, Accident Identification Card, must be completed with all pertinent information
       and provided upon vehicle turn-in to 31 LRS/LGRVM. The vehicle will not be considered
       reported to maintenance until the vehicle and all forms are properly submitted. The reporting party
       must record the responding Security Forces Squadron’s individual name and rank in block 81 of
       the Standard Form 91.
       3.1.2. The unit Commander and VCO/VCNCO will be notified by e-mail (Attachment 2, Notifi-
       cation letter), along with legal, finance and safety offices upon vehicle turn-in. In the event of a
       GOV accident, include a copy of the Security Forces accident report for wing safety office use, if
       available, (AFMAN 24-307 par. 1.28).
           3.1.2.1. The using organization has 10 calendar days from e-mail notification to conduct an
           investigation, gather ROS data (if required), take pictures, provide a release letter (Attach-
           ment 3, Maintenance Release letter) and/or file appeal to 31 LRS Vehicle Management and
           Analysis (VM&A). 31 LRS/LGRVM will open an accident/abuse repair work order and begin
           repairs on the 11th calendar day, or upon receipt of the release letter (Attachment 3) from the
           organization, whichever comes first, unless appealed (see Para 3.1.5.)
AVIANOI24-302 19 NOVEMBER 2004                                                                           3


     3.1.3. A vehicle repair estimate work order will be accomplished and pictures taken to create an
     accident or abuse case file.
        3.1.3.1. The Vehicle Accident/Abuse Estimate letter (Attachment 4) will be provided within
        the first 10 calendar days from e-mail notification and forwarded to the organizational com-
        mander and VCO/VCNCO by 31 LRS VM&A.
        3.1.3.2. If willful negligence is substantiated, Report of Surveys will be accomplished IAW
        AFMAN 23-220, Chapter 18.
        3.1.3.3. The investigator can not hold the position of VCO/VCNCO.
        3.1.3.4. Commanders may initiate a DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of Prop-
        erty Loss, investigation into the circumstances involving any accident or suspected vehicle
        abuse case where gross negligence is suspected. If the investigation reveals an operator’s gross
        negligence was the proximate cause of damage to a vehicle, commanders may assess pecuni-
        ary liability for the repair cost in accordance with AFMAN 23-220, Para. 8.63.
     3.1.4. If the estimated repair cost exceeds the vehicle's "one-time repair limit," the vehicle is con-
     sidered uneconomically repairable and will not be repaired; however, exceptions may be made to
     meet mission needs. These are determined by the 31 LRS Commander (delegated to the 31 LRS
     Operations Officer), HQ USAFE/A4 or 31 LRS Vehicle Maintenance Manager, depending on
     vehicle type.
        3.1.4.1. After repairs are completed, the actual repair cost is computed as follows:
            3.1.4.1.1. To the maximum extent possible, vehicle accident/abuse repairs will be con-
            tracted to local vendors, due to limited manning/resources. There may be cases where local
            vendors can not accomplish repairs due to mil-specific design vehicles. If the vehicle is
            repaired by 31 LRS/LGRVM, the using organization is charged with the cost of replace-
            ment parts and civilian labor. Funds transfers will be accomplished by relative funding
            documents and credited to the 31 LRS O&M account. This will be accomplished through
            the Automated Business Services System program. 31 LRS/LGRVM sends repair costs to
            the 31 LRS Resource Advisor, who in-turn requests funds transfer from the using organi-
            zation.
            3.1.4.1.2. If the vehicle is repaired by a contractor, the unit is charged with the repair cost
            (parts and labor) and will pay for damages with their unit Government Purchase Card upon
            acceptance and inspection by authorized vehicle maintenance personnel of repairs made.
            The using organization commander or designated representative will make payment to the
            contractor.
        3.1.4.2. Accidents and abuse case statistics will be reported/tracked by 31 LRS/LGRVM.
     3.1.5. Commanders disagreeing with the findings of liability may appeal to the 31 LRS Com-
     mander, delegated to the 31 LRS Operations Officer, within 10 calendar days from e-mail notifi-
     cation (Para 3.1.3.). Additionally, intent to appeal must be coordinated with 31 LRS VM&A prior
     to the 10th calendar day. If the 31 LRS Operation Officer does not support the appeal, the appeal
     package will be forwarded through the 31 LRS Commander, 31st Mission Support Group Com-
     mander to the 31st Fighter Wing Vice Commander for final determination.
        3.1.5.1. In case of an appeal, the commander of the responsible unit has an additional 30 days
4                                                          AVIANOI24-302 19 NOVEMBER 2004


       to appeal from the date the appeal is received at 31 LRS/LGRVM. If the appeal is approved,
       no transfer of funds will occur. If the appeal is unsuccessful or has not been resolved within 60
       days of notification, 31 LRS will then contact the financial analysis section to make sure the
       required payment is made.
    3.1.6. Payment by Government Purchase Card is directed. The organization will pay all bills asso-
    ciated with repair upon release of vehicles from a contractor and acceptance by vehicle mainte-
    nance personnel.
    3.1.7. An AF Form 20, Repair Costs and Repairable Value Statement, will be prepared when
    requested by the ROS officer and when a member is reimbursing the Air Force, IAW AFMAN
    24-307, Para. 2.15.2.
