                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. A team comprised of the Computer Sciences Corporation Weather Support
Office/Exploitation Unit (KBOS/WSO/EU) and the 26 Operational Weather
Squadron/Characterization Unit (CU) located at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, provides weather
support to the 81 TRW and associate units assigned or attached to Keesler AFB, Mississippi.
Basic concepts and procedures are outlined in Air Force and Air Education and Training
Command (AETC) directives, instructions and manuals.                This document establishes
requirements and procedures for areas of weather support that must be coordinated at the local
level to meet mission needs. It consolidates weather support requirements and procedures for
garrison operations, but does not cover procedures for emergency war operations or other special
operations/procedures that are covered in applicable base plans and instructions.
1.2. Concept of Operations.
   1.2.1. According to AFMAN 15-129V2, Air and Space Weather Operations-Exploitation,
   Air Force Weather (AFW) developed an integrated weather support structure in order to
   ensure weather operations were conducted at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels,
   and provide more meaningful environmental information, products, and data to operational
   customers. According to the CSAF-approved Strategic Plan for AFW Reengineering (8 Aug
   97), the 26 OWS/CU will provide resource protection, terminal aerodrome forecasts,
   regional, and operational-level weather products and information, meteorological watch
   (METWATCH), and Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV) (currently only available through phone
   patch), and limited flight weather briefing support for Air Force and Army locations within
   designated geographic regions.
   1.2.2. According to the Strategic Plan, the 26 OWS/CU at Barksdale AFB (BAFB),
   Louisiana will provide regional and operational-level weather products and information to
   Air Force and Army units in the Southern region of the Continental United States and for Air
   Force and Army forces operating in the Southern area of responsibility (AOR).
   1.2.3. Based on guidance from the Strategic Plan, Weather Operations/EU at each Air Force
   and Army location will be reengineered to focus on providing tactical-level weather products
   and information needed for mission execution and provide weather products and information
   to the commander of deployed forces during wartime, contingency, and exercise operations.
1.3. Responsibilities. General responsibilities of the 26th OWS/CU and Weather
Operations/EU are outlined in AFI 15-128, Specific responsibilities of the 26 OWS/CU and the
Keesler’s Weather Operations/EU are defined in the datasheet between KBOS/WSO/EU and 26
OWS/CU and in this instruction. The 26 OWS/CU provides timely, accurate and relevant
weather products as follows: weather warnings, watches, and advisories; Terminal Aerodrome
Forecasts (TAFs); regional and operational-level weather products; tactical-level weather
products; limited PMSV support during non-duty hours; and flight weather briefings to transient
aircrews passing through Keesler. Weather Operations/EU will issue all observed advisories and
warnings (during duty hours) and create tailored weather products focused on the local mission.
The Keesler Weather Operations/EU will also provide back up support (TAFs,
watches/warnings/advisories, etc) whenever the 26 OWS/CU is unable to complete their duties
 8                                                    KEESLERAFBI15-101 22 MAY 2013


for any reason. If needed, Keesler Weather Operations/EU will start 24 hour operations and
remain that way until the 26 OWS/CU is back up and operating. Additionally, Weather
Operations/EU will support the base in thoroughly educating agencies on the purpose,
applicability, and operating procedures of weather products in reference to Emergency
Management as outlined in AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program
Planning and Operations.
1.4. Duty Priorities.
     1.4.1. KBOS/WSO/EU Duty Priorities. Weather Operations/EU duty priorities are listed in
     Table 1.1. Forecasters will use good judgment in complying with these duty priorities,
     especially where there is imminent danger to life and/or property.

1.5. Operational Hours. 26 OWS/CU Weather Forecasters are on duty 24-hours a day, seven
(7) days a week. KBOS/WSO/EU is available from 0500L to 2300L Monday through Friday
(excluding non-training days (NTD) Fridays when operations begin at 0600) and 1000L to
1700L on Saturday and Sundays. On weekends when the 403 WG has Flying UTAs scheduled,
Weather Operations/EU will open on Sunday from 1100L to 2300L to accommodate the 403
WG scheduled missions. 403 WG will coordinate with 81 OSF leadership and KBOS/WSO/EU
LF for the times they need support. There is no KBOS/WSO/EO forecaster scheduled on federal
holidays or approved airfield closures. A weather forecaster can be contacted by phone at DSN
597-3305 or COMM 228-377-3305 or by fax at DSN 597-2459 or COMM 228-377-2459. When
the airfield is closed, a member of KBOS/WSO/EU is on standby to be recalled in the event the
airfield is opened outside of normal operating hours.
1.6. Assumptions, Shortfalls and Limitations.
KEESLERAFBI15-101 22 MAY 2013                                                                9


   1.6.1. 26 OWS/CU Assumptions. Adequate resources and communications will be available
   to execute the Datasheet and sufficient weather intelligence will be available from various
   sources on which to base weather operations and production.
   1.6.2. Weather Operations/EU Assumptions. Weather support can only be provided if the
   appropriate facilities, funding, communications, personnel, and indigenous support (e.g.,
   water, power, etc.) are available.
   1.6.3. Weather Operations/EU Shortfalls. Some services may not always be available due to
   Weather Operations/EU staffing, station evacuation, or other higher priority missions. In
   these cases, weather information can be obtained by contacting the 26 OWS/CU at DSN 331-
   2651 for weather briefings, or DSN 331-2622 for the Keesler AFB forecaster.
   1.6.4. Weather Operations/EU Limitations.
       1.6.4.1. Wind Speed/Direction Observations. When the winds are from the northwest
       and runway sensor 21 is in use, observed wind-speed readings will be lower due to the
       Marina tree line, additional wind data is available on RWY sensor 03.
       1.6.4.2. Lightning. Lightning may not be seen due to distance, low clouds, or poor
       visibility. Thunder may not be heard because of flight-line noise. The AN/FMQ-19
       Automated Meteorological Observing System (AMOS) lightning detection system
       detects both cloud-to-ground lightning and “cloud flashes”, but only plots cloud to
       ground strikes on the range ring display.
       1.6.4.3. PMSV Limitations. The PMSV frequency at Keesler is 267.4 MHz. Weather
       information is available during normal duty hours on frequency 267.4 MHz to provide
       aircrews with operational weather support. For aircraft outside the range of our PMSV
       system, when the station is closed, or during outages, they will have to obtain PMSV
       support from another agency. For phone patches to the 26 OWS/CU, aircrews can
       contact DSN 331-2651 or COMM 318-529-2651. See Flight Information Handbook
       section C for additional Pilot-to-Metro services.
       1.6.4.4. Climatological Limitations. Weather Operations/EU maintains only limited
       historical and climatological information; therefore, requests beyond Weather
       Operations/EU records will require additional time for processing through the 14th
       Weather Squadron.
1.7. Alternate/Back-up Operating Location (AOL). In the event of a building evacuation due
to hurricane, fire, bomb threat, etc., Airfield Services Element, Mission Weather Element and
Staff Services Element will move to either the alternate operating location (Bldg 4332, Rm
W235) or to the hurricane evacuation shelter (Bldg 4330 Wolfe Hall), as appropriate to continue
operational flight weather support and Weather Operations/EU “eyes forward” responsibilities
for the 26 OWS/CU. The current AOL affords Weather Operations/EU with much the same
operational capability as the primary operating location with the exception of PMSV support,
Open Principal User Processor (OPUP) radar and an AN/FMQ-19 AMOS Operation Interface
Device. Upon evacuation from the primary operating location, Weather Forecasters will inform
the ATC Tower and let them know we are evacuating and ask them to inform aircrews trying to
contact Keesler Metro that our PMSV is out and they will need to contact another location for
assistance. Airfield Services Element and Mission Weather Elements providers will follow duty
specific Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Weather Operations/EU Evacuation
 10                                                     KEESLERAFBI15-101 22 MAY 2013


Checklists (including a list of required backup equipment) and resume services at the alternate
location as soon as possible. For flight safety reasons, Weather Operations/EU will not evacuate
for exercises. See Chapter 10.2.1. and 10.3. for details on back-up procedures.
   1.7.1. Limitations at the AOL. During supplementation/back up of the AN/FMQ-19 AMOS,
   observations at the AOL will be taken from the top floor of Bldg 4332. This affords
   KBOS/WSO/EU an excellent view of the airfield. However, there is a restriction of the
   south end of the runway by trees and buildings. When KBOS/WSO/EU personnel are taking
   observations, they will be away from the phones for several minutes. Most Weather
   Operations/EU services/support should be provided, but will require a case-by-case
   assessment dependent upon communication line status, equipment status, etc. Weather
   Operations/EU will continue to keep an operational backup in the event of total
   communication failure. Expect some services to be somewhat degraded (weather products,
   pilot briefings, etc.) due to limited facilities and loss of dedicated data services, including
   various data types (OPUP, AN/FMQ-19 AMOS, etc).
   1.7.2. AOL contact information. Once KBOS/WSO/EU forecasters arrive at the AOL, they
   will contact the 26 OWS/CU, Command Post and each of the flying squadrons and provide
   them with a contact number (377-8758) for Weather Operations/EU
   1.7.3. Evacuation for Hurricanes. Weather Forecasters will start 24 hour operations (if not
   already occurring) when the 81 TRW/CC or 81 TRW/CV orders the base into HURCON 2.
   Weather Forecasters will evacuate to Wolfe Hall (Bldg. 4330) for sheltering once all aircraft
   have evacuated the base and Base Operations officially closes Keesler’s airfield.
1.8. Release of Weather Information to Non-DOD Agencies and Individuals. Except as
authorized by 81 TRW Public Affairs, non-DOD organizations and individuals will be referred
to other government or private weather information services for weather data (e.g., local National
Weather Service [NWS]). Any questions/clarifications will be coordinated through the Weather
Operations/EU Lead Forecaster.
   1.8.1. Weather requests by foreign nationals must be coordinated with AF Scientific and
   Technical Information officers before being fulfilled by Weather Operations/EU.
1.9. Post-Mission Analysis/Feedback. Per AFMAN 15-129V2, Chapter 2, units that regularly
utilize weather support from Weather Operations/EU will provide post-mission/utilization
feedback, when possible. This information will be used to ensure proper Quality Assurance
(QA) and to provide a metrics database. Formal/informal feedback methods include:
   1.9.1. Transient (faxed) and local weather brief feedback sheets located at the Mission
   Weather Element counter and flying squadrons.
   1.9.2. Feedback sheets accompanying all faxed Flight Weather Briefings (FWB).
   1.9.3. Email to KBOS/WSO/EU Lead Forecaster or call 377-3938. Feedback sheets can also
   be placed in boxes provided for that purpose.
   1.9.4. Routing through the base mail system.
   1.9.5. Face to face feedback after any briefing.
   1.9.6. Weather Operations/EU will, in turn, utilize this data to refine their mission support
   role and gauge unit strengths and weaknesses. Representative sample sizes are necessary to
KEESLERAFBI15-101 22 MAY 2013                                                               11


   accurately reflect the satisfaction with and accuracy of the mission weather support being
   provided to Keesler’s flying units by Weather Operations/EU. Since the Supervisor of
   Flying (SOF)/Duty Officer is Weather Operations primary Point of Contact (POC) for daily
   operational support, at least one SOF/DUTY OFFICER feedback submission per day (any
   formal listed type of feedback from previous methods) is desired. Web-based or emailed
   submissions are preferred. For counter forecast briefings (transient, etc.), at least one
   feedback sheet (web-based or paper copy) per day is desired.
   1.9.7. SOFs or aircrews can also provide feedback during liaison visits. Workload and
   weather conditions permitting, Weather Forecasters will visit the 53 WRS duty desks not less
   than one (1) day per week when flying is taking place. The 815th AS/345th AS will be
   contacted, at a minimum, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. During these visits, discussions will
   include weather for the day, weather for the next flying day and the next five (5) days, as
   well as how missions from the previous day were affected by weather. These visits provide
   an excellent opportunity for aircrews to provide feedback about briefings and MEF products.
1.10. Mishap Procedures. Both Mission Weather Element and Airfield Services Element have
a role when Weather Operations is advised of an emergency or mishap. Air Force Weather
Agency (AFWA) and the 26 OWS/CU are also involved. See section 4.11. for Aircraft Accident
procedures.
1.11. Utilization of Weather Forecasters. Weather Forecasters are not to be tasked for ready
augmented positions or functions and details that will take them away from their Mission
Weather Element or Airfield Services Element duties.
1.12. Records Management. The Exploitation Unit will maintain and dispose of records
according to Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) (https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims).

2.4. Non-Flying Customer Weather Limitations. The KBOS/WSO/EU gains regular
exposure to Keesler’s customer leadership through briefings and weather discussions. Increased
awareness of mission limitations is necessary for proper tailored weather support. See
Attachment 3 for a list of Keesler AFB Units and the weather that impacts their mission.
KEESLERAFBI15-101 22 MAY 2013                                                                    15

                              MISSION WEATHER ELEMENT

3.1. General. Mission Weather Element includes those actions directly related to completing
each customer’s daily mission(s) (e.g., Flight Weather Briefings). The Flying Area Mission
Execution Forecast (FAMEF) is the primary tool used by the 403d WG to accomplish their
mission. FAMEFs are tailored to individual customer requirements. A Mission Execution
Forecast (MEF) can also be a DD Form 175-1 Flight Weather Briefing or a non-flying forecast
for activities that may be affected by weather and require planning.
3.2. Operational Hours. Most mission services, like flying FAMEFs, are only required during
normal duty and/or flying hours. Weather Operations/EU will have at least one person dedicated
to Mission Weather Element during normal duty hours/days if unit manning is adequate.
Missions outside these times or in times of inadequate manning will be accomplished by
forecasters performing Airfield Service Element duties or, if needed and available, by scheduling
additional Weather Forecasters during that period. Forecasting services are available 24 hours a
day from Weather Operations/EU/26 OWS/CU team. Weather Operations/EU has a Weather
Forecaster on duty from 0500L to 2300L Monday through Friday (excluding NTD Fridays when
operations begin at 0600) and 1000L to 1700L on Saturday and Sundays. On weekends when the
403d WG has Flying UTAs scheduled, Weather Operations/EU will open on Sunday from 1100L
to 2300L to accommodate the 403d WG scheduled missions. The Mission Weather Element
Weather Forecaster can be contacted by phone at DSN 597-3305 or COMM 228-377-3305 or by
fax at DSN 597-2459 or COMM 228-377-2459. The 26 OWS/CU operates continuously.
During non-duty hours, the 26 OWS/CU can be contacted at DSN 331-2651 or Commercial 318-
529-2651 for forecasting/briefing assistance.
3.3. Flying Area Mission Execution Forecasts. FAMEFs are essentially mission-specific
forecasts that are developed using an 8-step process, outlined in AFMAN 15-129V2, and will be
provided as a web based briefing, a verbal, or on a DD Form 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing.
During this process, Weather Operations/EU will fuse and tailor products created by strategic
and theater weather centers, as well as information supplied by local units (e.g., flying schedule)
and agencies. The end result is a product/information designed to provide timely, accurate, and
relevant weather intelligence to various customers by whatever means proves most effective.
FAMEFs must be horizontally consistent with (but not necessarily mirror) products issued by the
26 OWS/CU and AFWA. However, during rapidly changing conditions, emergencies or when
conditions threaten resource protection, Weather Operations/EU will amend the FAMEF to
accurately reflect conditions and back brief the 26 OWS/CU when time permits. The FAMEF
will be posted to the 26 OWS/CU webpage for local Keesler aircrews to use. If the primary
method is down, verbal briefings and or a DD Form 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing, will be
used. Also, if Weather Operations loses Internet capability and are unable to complete FAMEFs,
they will turn to the 26 OWS/CU for backup support until Internet capabilities return. FAMEFs
will be posted twice a day Monday - Friday, three (3) hours prior to the first local area flight for
both the morning and afternoon when local area missions are scheduled by Keesler aircrews.
The morning FAMEF will be valid one hour prior to takeoff for nine hours. The afternoon
FAMEF will be valid from one hour (1) prior to takeoff until local flying is completed. Once
local flying is completed or the FAMEF is no longer valid, the blank master FAMEF stating
 16                                                       KEESLERAFBI15-101 22 MAY 2013


when the next FAMEF will be issued is to be posted. If the afternoon and evening flights are
scheduled to land within two (2) hours of the ending valid time of the morning FAMEF, it may
be reviewed and extended to cover those flights instead of issuing a completely new product at
1500L. Local Missions are defined as taking off and landing at Keesler AFB, MS (KBIX), with
stops at Gulfport, MS (KGPT), Mobile, AL (KMOB), Stennis, MS (KHSA) Camp Shelby
Auxiliary Field (KSH1), Baton Rouge Municipal Airport (KBTR), with Navy New Orleans
(KNBG), Jackson, MS (KJAN),and Maxwell AFB, AL (KMXF) being alternates. The alternate
section will be filled out when any airfield in the local section is forecasted to have ceilings/vies
less than 2,000’/3miles, or if requested by the customer. Any other flights must call (377-3305)
to receive a DD Form 175-1 or verbal weather briefing. Backup dissemination for the FAMEF
will be by fax, phone or hand delivery. See Attachment 4 for an example of Tab 1 (FAMEF) and
Tab 2 (Drop zone forecasts). Note: Times the FAMEFs are issued are subject to change based
on mission requirements.
   3.3.1. Amendment Criteria. Forecasters will amend the FAMEF whenever any of the
   Mission Limiting Thresholds (listed in Tables 2.1. – 2.3.) are met and not correctly
   forecasted for. Before amending, the Weather Forecaster will call the flying squadron
   SOFs/Duty Officers and give them a brief description of why we are amending the FAMEF.
   The forecaster will then amend the FAMEF and repost it to the 26 OWS/CU webpage. The
   forecaster will then call the SOFs/Duty Officers once again and inform them that the
   amended FAMEF is posted.
   3.3.2. Updates. Weather Forecasters will monitor the FAMEF continuously and update it as
   required. Updates to the FAMEF, including category changes (representative amendments
   are not required), may precede the issuance of the 26 OWS/CUs TAF but must be verbally
   coordinated between Weather Operations and the 26 OWS/CU prior to any FAMEF changes.
   3.3.3. Follow-Up Support. Aircrews are welcome to contact Weather Operations/EU (377-
   3305) for any post-mission information and/or follow-up support. Feedback information is
   available in Chapter 1.9..
   3.3.4. The FAMEF sections are filled out as follows:
       3.3.4.1. The Local Flying Area Forecasts and Alternates sections will be filled out in the
       same manner as a DD Form 175-1.
       3.3.4.2. FL Level Winds are Above Ground Level (AGL). Wind direction and speed
       will be predominate directions with worst case wind speed. If there is an expected shift
       in direction (IE frontal passage) additional wind directions and speeds will be provided in
       the block.
       3.3.4.3. Hazards. If the box for a hazard is green, that hazard is not forecasted during the
       forecast period. If the box for a hazard is red, that hazard is forecasted during the
       forecast period. Note: These boxes are clickable links, if they (or any of the clickable
       links on the FAMEF) are not operating; aircrews are directed to contact Weather
       Operations /EU for the information.
       3.3.4.4. Today’s Light Data is provided in local time and is based on the information for
       Keesler AFB.
KEESLERAFBI15-101 22 MAY 2013                                                                   17


3.4. Flight Weather Briefings. Weather Forecasters will provide verbal or traditional Flight
Weather Briefings (DD Form 175-1) to aircrews as requested and following Weather
Operations/EU duty priorities listed in Table 1.1. Briefings for Keesler Air Force Base (KAFB)
aircrews departing from KAFB will be provided by Weather Operations/EU between 0600L and
2300L Monday –Friday excluding federal holidays and approved airfield closers. Briefings for
KAFB aircrews outside this time frame must be coordinated with Weather Operations/EU in
advance. Briefings will be either at Weather Operations/EU, building 0233, or via fax or phone.
Weather Forecasters require a 2-hr notice prior to briefing time to allow for the most accurate
weather data. Aircrews can contact Weather Operations/EU sat 377-3305 to request a briefing.
Out-of-station mass briefings for special missions require 48-hours advanced notice, are subject
to staffing availability, and must be coordinated with Weather Operations/EU leadership at 377-
0486 or 377-3938. Transient aircrews departing KAFB will receive flight weather briefings
from the Keesler Weather Operations/EU during published duty hours, their home Base Weather
Station, or the 26 OWS/CU. EXCEPTION: All strategic mobility missions will be passed to an
IFM (Integrated Flight Managed) at 618 AOC (TACC)/XOW (618th Air and Space Operations
Center [Tanker Airlift Control Center] located at Scott Air Force Base). The 26 OWS/CU can be
contacted by phone (DSN 331-2651) or via web access (https://ows.barksdale.af.mil/), in
Operations, click on Request a Briefing. The transient aircrew weather briefing area located in
Weather Operations/EU will be used to obtain briefings from the home Base Weather Station or
26 OWS/CU. These briefings are normally done face to face or sent via fax. If the fax is
inoperable, Weather Forecasters can hand deliver the product if manning allows. Also, if
Weather Operations/EU loses Internet capability and are unable to complete FAMEFs, they will
turn to the 26 OWS/CU for backup support until Internet capabilities return.
   3.4.1. Updates. Weather Forecasters will monitor the DD Form 175-1 until the aircraft is
   outside Keesler AFB ATC Tower control, which is 4.2NM/5SM. If updates are needed,
   forecasters will provide them to the aircrews before leaving Base Operations. If the aircrew
   has left Base Operations, forecasters will contact Keesler AFB ATC and request they contact
   the aircrew and have the aircrew call Weather Operations/EU on the PMSV. See Attachment
   5 for an example of the DD Form 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing.
   3.4.2. If operating off station, WSO/EU is still the primary weather support agency during
   KAFB airfield operating hours and that during non-duty hours the 26th CU takes over that
   responsibility. WSO/EU will also make sure that if they or the 26th CU is not available that
   the DSNs and Commercial phone numbers for other CUs are made available.
3.5. 815 AS / 345 AS Drop Zone and Camp Shelby Assault Landing Strip Mission
Execution Forecast. 815 AS / 345 AS Drop Zone and Assault Landing Strip Mission Execution
Forecasts are mission-specific forecasts developed using an 8-step process outlined by AFMAN
15-129V2. During the process, Weather Operations/EU will fuse and tailor products created by
strategic and theater weather centers, as well as information supplied by local units (e.g., flying
schedule) and agencies. The end result is a product or information that is designed to provide
timely, accurate, and relevant weather intelligence to various customers by whatever means
proves most effective. The Drop Zone MEF will be posted on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday,
with Assault Landings conducted on Wednesday. The Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday
afternoon missions will be flown at Stennis DZ only, with the mission on Thursday morning
flown at Ralffie DZ. The Assault Landing Strip MEF will be posted daily on the same section as
the FAMEF. Both will be posted on the 26 OWS/CU website under the tailored pages section
 18                                                      KEESLERAFBI15-101 22 MAY 2013


along with the FAMEF. If the 815 AS / 345AS needs the Drop Zone MEF at any other time,
they will coordinate with Weather Operations/EU on when the product is needed. If Weather
Operations/EU is not able to post the briefing, it can be hand delivered by a forecaster if manning
allows, or the 815 AS / 345 AS can send a runner for pickup at Weather Operations/EU. See
Attachment 4 for an example of the 815 AS / 345 AS Drop Zone Mission Execution Forecast.
   3.5.1. Amendment Criteria. Weather Forecasters will amend the Drop Zone or Assault
   Landing Strip MEF whenever any of the Mission Limiting Thresholds (listed in Table 2.4.)
   are met and not correctly forecasted for. The Weather Forecaster will call the 815 AS / 345
   AS Duty Officer and give them a description of why we are amending the Drop Zone MEF.
   3.5.2. The 815 AS / 345 AS Drop Zone MEF consists of two pages: first page includes the
   daily FAMEF which also has the Assault Landing Strip (KSH1) and the second page
   includes forecasts for the Stennis and Ralffie Drop Zones. In the event of a change in times,
   locations or delivery method, 815 AS / 345 AS leadership will contact Weather
   Operations/EU
       3.5.2.1. The first page is the normal daily FAMEF. All times and locations have been
       coordinated with 815 AS / 345 AS leadership.
       3.5.2.2. The second page is a local document created in coordination with 815 AS/345
       AS leadership and will be filled out in the following manner:
           3.5.2.2.1. FL Winds/Temp: Altitudes are in AGL. Wind direction and speed will be
           predominate directions with worst case wind speed. If there is an expected shift in
           direction (IE frontal passage) additional wind directions and speeds will be provided
           in the block.
           3.5.2.2.2. Forecasted surface winds, temperature, cloud cover, visibility/weather and
           altimeter will be in the same manner as that data would be filled out on a normal DD
           Form 175-1.
3.6. Missionwatch. This term is used to describe the process by which Weather Operations/EU
monitors the weather for all missions. All on-site meteorological and commercial data sources
(METSAT, Weather Radar, Websites, etc.) may be used to accomplish this task and is the
primary responsibility of the Mission Weather Element. It is through this method that MEF
amendments/updates are accomplished.            During rapidly changing weather, Weather
Operations/EU will amend/update the MEF as required and contact the owning SOF/Duty
Officer to pass on critical changes. Significant changes include: hazards not briefed, destination
and alternates all reflecting mission limiting threshold conditions not previously briefed, any
PIREPs or Sigmets received along the route which contain hazards not briefed on departure, etc.
3.7. Pilot-to-Metro Service. Weather information is available during normal duty hours on
frequency 267.4 MHz to provide aircrews with operational weather support. For aircraft outside
the range of our PMSV system, when the station is closed, or during outages, they will have to
obtain PMSV support from another agency. For phone patches to the 26 OWS/CU, aircrews can
contact DSN 331-2651 or COMM 318-529-2651.
   3.7.1. Weather Operations/EU will disseminate PIREPs locally when they reflect
   operationally significant weather within 50NM of Keesler AFB (reports of any icing,
   turbulence, low-level wind shear, thunderstorm activity, tops/bases of clouds, flight visibility,
KEESLERAFBI15-101 22 MAY 2013                                                      19


  and obstructions to vision). PIREPs will be disseminated long-line IAW AFMAN 15-124,
  Meteorological Codes.

                             AIRFIELD SERVICES ELEMENT

4.1. General. Airfield Services Element includes those actions that affect the Keesler
aerodrome or base as a whole. Examples include weather observations, and resource protection.
Resource protection, however, will be addressed in Chapter 7.
4.2. Operational Hours. KBOS/WSO/EU Airfield Services Element is available from 0600L
to 2300L Monday through Friday (excluding NTD Fridays when operational hours begin at
0600) and 1000L to 1700L on Saturday and Sundays. On weekends when the 403 WG has
Flying UTAs scheduled, Weather Operations/EU will open on Sunday from 1100L to 2300L to
accommodate the 403 WG scheduled missions. 403 WG will coordinate with 81 OSF leadership
and KBOS/WSO/EU LF for the times they need support. There is no Airfield Services Element
scheduled on federal holidays or approved airfield closures. Airfield Services Element Weather
Forecasters can be contacted by phone at DSN 597-4397 or COMM 228-377-4397 or by fax at
DSN 597-2459 or COMM 228-377-2459. When the airfield is closed, a member of
KBOS/WSO/EU is on standby to be recalled in the event the airfield is opened outside of normal
operating hours.
   4.2.1. There will be a Weather Operations/EU stand by Weather Forecaster available at all
   times who will man Weather Operations/EU outside the “normal” operating hours
   mentioned in paragraph 4.2. This Weather Forecaster will man Weather Operations/EU
   when severe watch or warning criteria is expected or present (excluding lightning
   watches/warnings) or for aircraft arrivals or departures. Standby forecasters will be recalled
   by the Keesler Command Post (recall will be initiated due to notification by 26 OWS/CU or
   opening of the KAFB airfield). Once notified of the recall, the standby forecaster will arrive
   as soon as possible after being recalled. Standby forecasters will also be available for
   mission requirements, of which a remote briefing from the 26 OWS/CU will not suffice.
4.3. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast. IAW AFI 15-128, AFMAN 15-129V2, and Datasheet,
the 26 OWS/CU issues a TAF for the KAFB aerodrome every eight hours at 0500 Central Time
(CT), 1300 CT, and 2100 CT (TAFs will not be issued on airfield closure days); The TAF issued
prior to airfield closure will contain the remark “LAST NO AMDS AFT ddhh NEXT ddhh" (dd
is the date and hh is the time when the airfield closes, the next dd is the date and hh is the time
when the new TAF is required). When the WSO/EU unit has been closed, the next initial TAF is
issued not more than three (3) hours prior to the airfield opening. The TAF will then specify
"LIMITED METWATCH ddhh TIL ddhh" (dd is the date and hh is the time when the TAF is
issued, the next dd is the date and hh is the time when the airfield opens). The TAF covers a 30-
hour period from the time of issuance and is disseminated by the 26 OWS/CU via the ADS.
TAFs apply to the area within a 5NM radius of a designated center point of KAFB. TAF
specification and amendment criteria are listed in Attachment 9. Attachment 10 contains
examples of typical KAFB TAFs.
   4.3.1. If the primary means of dissemination is inoperable the TAF will be disseminated (via
   e-mail, fax, or verbally) to Weather Operations/EU who will then relay the information to the
   tower, base operations, and, if necessary, Keesler CP. It will be entered into the Automated
   Weather Network (AWN) by the Keesler Weather Operations/EU, another Base Weather
KEESLERAFBI15-101 22 MAY 2013                                                               21


   Station, or via an approved Internet Site (e.g., the Joint Air Force and Army Information
   Network (JAAWIN) or the Air Force Weather Web Services (AFW-WEBS)).
4.4. Observations. Observations are taken, recorded, and disseminated IAW AFMAN 15-111,
Surface Weather Observations. The AF Form 3813, Federal Meteorological Surface Weather
Observations (METAR/SPECI), will be used as the form/method for observation record.
Observations typically contain the following elements: observation type; date/time; wind speed
and direction (true); prevailing visibility; runway visual range (RVR) as required; present
weather; cloud groups; temperature/dew-point; altimeter setting (ALSTG); and additional
remarks. There are two types of observations (described in 4.4.3 and 4.4.4) that are seen by
customers. Attachment 10 contains examples of the different types of observations.
   4.4.1. AN/FMQ-19 AMOS. The AN/FMQ-19 AMOS is the primary instrument used to take
   observations at Keesler AFB. During the hours that the airfield is closed, the AN/FMQ-19
   AMOS will be in Automated Mode. During this time, the AN/FMQ-19 AMOS will send
   observations automatically. During the hours that the airfield is open (0800L-2300L Mon-
   Fri, 1100L-1700L on non UTA weekends, and 1200L to 2300L on Flying UTA Sundays),
   the system will be supplemented or backed up, when necessary, according to paragraphs
   4.4.1.1 and 4.4.1.2 (Note: The AN/FMQ-19 AMOS will also be augmented if a forecaster is
   called in for resource protection when the airfield is closed)
       4.4.1.1. Supplementing the AN/FMQ-19 AMOS. Supplementing is the method of
       manually adding meteorological information to an automated observation generated by
       the AN/FMQ-19 AMOS that is beyond its capabilities to detect or report.
       Supplementation is mandatory when any of the following are met (see Table 4.1.).
       Supplementing is also mandatory when Local authorities (wing/garrison or senior
       mission commander) deem an operationally significant parameter, beyond the capability
       of the system to measure requires supplementation based on their operational risk
       assessment (e.g. if the airfield remains open when visibility falls below 1/4 mile, then
       visibility values below 1/4 mile should be supplemented).

Table 4.1. Supplementary Weather Conditions.
Mandatory Supplementary Weather Conditions – Body of Report (Note 1.)
Tornado (+FC) (Note 2 and 3)
Funnel Cloud (FC) (Note 2 and 3)
Water Spout (+FC) (Note 2 and 3) Hail (GR) – (Local Warning Criteria Only Greater than or
equal to ½”)
Volcanic Ash (VA)
Any weather elements deemed operationally significant that is beyond the capabilities of the
automated weather observing system.
Mandatory Supplementary Weather Conditions – Remarks Section of Report (Note 1.)
Funnel Cloud (Tornadic Activity B/E(hh)mm LOC/DIR (MOV)) (Note 2)
Visibility < 1/2 mile (800 meters) and or ceiling < 200’Snow Depth (Note 4) (Only during
airfield operating hours and if heavy snow warning has been issued and snowfalls is occurring)

Notes:
1. References for coding of augmentable weather conditions are in Chapter 13, AFMAN 15-111.
2. The immediate reporting of funnel clouds takes precedent over any other phenomena.
3. Log on to AMOS and be prepared to supplement for tornadic activity anytime a weather
watch or warning has been issued for the phenomena.
4. All remarks and Additive Data references are provided in Attachment 3, AFMAN 15-111.

         4.4.1.2. Backing up the AN/FMQ-19 AMOS. Backup (editing) is the process of
         providing meteorological data, documentation, and/or communication of an AN/FMQ-19
         AMOS weather observation when the primary automated method is unavailable or
         unrepresentative. Backup of the AN/FMQ-19 AMOS by the Weather Forecaster
         provides the minimum acceptable level of available data for meteorological operations
         and the support of aviation operations in the event of a partial or total AN/FMQ-19
         AMOS failure.
            4.4.1.2.1. The following functions of the AN/FMQ-19 AMOS will be backed up if
            the Weather Forecaster judges the difference between what the AN/FMQ-19 AMOS
            is reporting and manually observed conditions are operationally significant: wind
            speed and direction, visibility, selected present weather elements and obscurations,
            sky cover up to and including 12,000 feet, temperature and dew point temperature,
            altimeter setting, some remarks and additive data. In these instances, Weather
            Forecasters must log out the AN/FMQ-19 AMOS with maintenance to have the
            sensor evaluated and the issue corrected.
   4.4.2. Official Observing Site.
         4.4.2.1. Official Automated Observing Site. This is the location of the primary sensor
         AN/FMQ-19 AMOS. At Keesler AFB, this location is just west of the 21 end of the
         runway, across from the Marina.
         4.4.2.2. Official Manual Observing Site. The physical location from which the Weather
         Forecaster visually determines sky condition, present weather and prevailing visibility is
         the official observing site. Keesler’s official Manual observation point is on the flight-
         line side of bldg 0233 and approximately 20 yards in front of Base Operations flight-line
         entrance door. This observation can be supplemented with conditions observed from the
         stairwell next to Weather Operations/EU (weather permitting) and the southeast external
         corner of bldg 0233. This is the location from where Weather Forecasters will back-up or
         supplement the AN/FMQ-19 AMOS.
   4.4.3. METAR (Routine Meteorological Observation Report). METAR observations are
   taken and disseminated every hour between 55 and 59 minutes after the hour. METAR
   observations are disseminated both locally and long-line.
   4.4.4. SPECI (Special Observation). SPECI observations are taken whenever certain
   weather events, defined in AFMAN 15-111 and listed in Attachment 11, are observed at
   KAFB. These observations are disseminated both locally and long-line.
KEESLERAFBI15-101 22 MAY 2013                                                                   23


4.5. Basic Weather Watch (BWW). A BWW is a process by which Weather Forecasters
periodically recheck weather at intervals not to exceed 20 minutes. Because Keesler AFB is an
automated station, a BWW is performed during AMOS augmentation.
4.6. Continuous Weather Watch (CWW). A CWW is a process by which Weather
Forecasters continuously watch weather conditions without performing any other duties. There
is no established requirement for a continuous weather watch at KAFB.
4.7. Cooperative Weather Watch. This is the process by which Air Traffic Control (ATC)
personnel, SOF/DUTY OFFICERs, flying units and Security Forces (SF) personnel report
changes in weather conditions to the duty Weather Forecaster (377-3305/4397). Of primary
concern is the occurrence of previously unreported weather conditions that could affect flight
safety or which could be critical to the safety or efficiency of other local operations and
resources. These changes may be included in the next scheduled surface observation, become
the basis for an entirely new observation or be included as reports of differing conditions in the
remarks section of an observation in progress. Cooperative weather watch inherently dictates
close contact between the KAFB Weather Operations/EU and the previously mentioned
organizations and/or personnel, especially ATC. Weather Operations/EU leadership will be
responsible for ensuring cooperative weather watch compliance by coordinating with associated
cooperative weather watch unit leadership. Cooperative Weather Watch techniques are included
in the ATC Indoctrination training that’s provided by Weather to new Tower personnel. After a
basic weather test has been passed, the Tower personnel’s training is then recorded in their
training records.
   4.7.1. ATC personnel will notify Weather Operations/EU when / if:
       4.7.1.1. A PIREP is received. ATC personnel will pass airborne weather information
       and PIREPs to Weather Operations/EU IAW FAAO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control.
       4.7.1.2. Anytime changes in clouds are noticed (e.g., the ceiling raises or lowers or cloud
       cover changes from scattered to broken/overcast or vice versa).
       4.7.1.3. Tower visibility decreases to less than, or if below, increases to equal or exceeds
       4, 3, 2, 1 3/4, 1 1/2, 1 1/4, 1, 3/4 or 1/2 miles.
       4.7.1.4. Precipitation begins, ends or changes in form (e.g., rain becomes ice pellets,
       turns into snow, etc.).
       4.7.1.5. Thunder is heard.
       4.7.1.6. A tornado, funnel cloud or waterspout is observed and/or disappears from sight.
       4.7.1.7. Lightning is observed at any distance from the control tower.
       4.7.1.8. When prevailing visibility is one mile or less or the runway visual range (RVR)
       is 6,000 feet or less, report changes to the high intensity runway light setting to Weather
       Operations/EU
       4.7.1.9. When ATC judges the automated observation to be unrepresentative of actual
       conditions. At that time, the weather forecaster will evaluate the situation to determine if
       augmentation is necessary.
       4.7.1.10. IAW FAAO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control Tower personnel must use the lower
       prevailing visibility from either the Weather Forecaster (surface) or from the air traffic
24                                                      KEESLERAFBI15-101 22 MAY 2013


     controller (tower level) for aircraft operations when the visibility at either location is less
     than four miles.
  4.7.2. Security Forces personnel will:
     4.7.2.1. Report observed damaging or threatening weather conditions to Weather
     Operations/EU or to the Keesler Command Post (CP) for relay to Weather
     Operations/EU. Early reports of undetected phenomena could be critical for warning
     other personnel who require shelter.
     4.7.2.2. Collect area impacts of severe weather events and report them to Weather
     Operations/EU or the CP for relay to Weather Operations/EU. Note: Threatening
     weather includes; close proximity lightning, funnel clouds, tornadoes, waterspouts, hail
     of any size, wind gusts affecting unsecured objects, etc.
  4.7.3. Fire Department personnel will:
     4.7.3.1. Provide CBRNE support to base personnel.
     4.7.3.2. Collect area impacts of severe weather events and report them to Weather
     Operations/EU or the CP for relay to Weather Operations/EU.
  4.7.4. Locally stationed aircrew will report PIREPs IAW Flight Information Handbook
  Section C and 11 series AFIs. They will:
     4.7.4.1. Report unusual or unforecasted weather to appropriate control agency without
     delay.
     4.7.4.2. Provide PIREPs over PMSV to include weather conditions experienced during
     climb and descent.
     4.7.4.3. Provide PIREPs for the following criteria, which will be disseminated as
     “Urgent Upper Air” reports by weather personnel.
         4.7.4.3.1. Tornado/waterspout or funnel cloud.
         4.7.4.3.2. Thunderstorms Note: The requirement for thunderstorms refers to the
         occurrence of an area of widespread activity, thunderstorms along a line with little or
         no space between individual storms, or thunderstorms embedded in cloud layers or
         concealed by haze. It does not refer to isolated or scattered thunderstorms not
         embedded in clouds or not concealed by haze.
         4.7.4.3.3. Tropical cyclones.
         4.7.4.3.4. Squall line.

         4.7.4.3.8. Widespread dust storm or sandstorm.
         4.7.4.3.9. Low-level Wind Shear (LLWS), when the fluctuation in airspeed is 10
         knots or more.
         4.7.4.3.10. Hail.
KEESLERAFBI15-101 22 MAY 2013                                                                   25


         4.7.4.3.11. Volcanic eruption and/or ash when reported by any source, in the air or
         on the ground.
  4.7.5. Local SOF/DUTY OFFICERs will:
     4.7.5.1. Relay all PIREPs and summary of flight weather conditions experienced by their
     aircrew to the Weather Forecasters as received.
     4.7.5.2. Provide feedback in accordance with Paragraph 1.9 of this instruction.
  4.7.6. Weather Forecasters will:
     4.7.6.1. Notify the Air Traffic Control Tower as soon as possible, whenever the
     prevailing visibility at the weather unit's observation point decreases to less than, or
     increases to equal or exceed four (4) miles (6,000 meters).
     4.7.6.2. Re-evaluate surface prevailing or sector visibility as soon as practicable, upon
     initial receipt of a differing Air Traffic Control Tower value, and upon receipt of
     subsequent reportable changes at the Air Traffic Control Tower level.
     4.7.6.3. Use Air Traffic Control Tower values of prevailing (during back up operations)
     or sector visibility (during supplemented operations) as a guide in determining the surface
     visibility when the view of portions of the horizon is obstructed by buildings, aircraft, etc.
     The presence of a surface-based obscuration, uniformly distributed to heights above the
     level of the Air Traffic Control Tower, is sufficient reason to consider the weather unit's
     prevailing visibility to be the same as the Air Traffic Control Tower level.
     4.7.6.4. Contact the Air Traffic Control Tower if any of the following is expected to
     occur at Keesler AFB within the next hour: (This provides Air Traffic Control personnel
     advance notice to monitor for changing conditions).
         4.7.6.4.1. Tornadic Activity.
         4.7.6.4.2. Ceilings below 2,000 feet.
         4.7.6.4.3. Visibility below 4SM.
         4.7.6.4.4. Thunderstorms.
         4.7.6.4.5. Lightning.
         4.7.6.4.6. Precipitation.
         4.7.6.4.7. Winds > 50kts.
     4.7.6.5. Weather Forecasters will reevaluate the weather conditions whenever reliable
     source (i.e., ATC, pilots, local law enforcement, etc.) reports weather conditions different
     from the last disseminated observation (e.g., different ceiling height, visibility, present
     weather). Based on reevaluation of the different weather conditions reported and local
     policy, Weather Forecasters will:
         4.7.6.5.1. Generate a SPECI observation (during supplemented/back up operations) if
         the different conditions warrant immediate dissemination.
         4.7.6.5.2. Include the differing conditions in the next required METAR or SPECI
         observation (during supplemented/back up operations) if the conditions alone do not
         warrant immediate dissemination.
 26                                                      KEESLERAFBI15-101 22 MAY 2013


           4.7.6.5.3. Incorporate into any Mission Execution Forecast that is valid.
       4.7.6.6. Issue watches warnings and advisories to base agencies.
       4.7.6.7. Weather Operations/EU will disseminate PIREPs locally when they reflect
       operationally significant weather within 50NM of Keesler AFB (reports of any icing,
       turbulence, low-level wind shear, thunderstorm activity, tops/bases of clouds, flight
       visibility, and obstructions to vision). PIREPs will be disseminated long-line IAW
       AFMAN 15-124, Meteorological Codes.
       4.7.6.8. Contact the ATC Tower and let them know that our PMSV is out. Ask them to
       inform aircrews trying to contact Keesler Metro that our PMSV is out and they will need
       to contact another location for assistance.
       4.7.6.9. Provide the Fire Department, Bio-Environmental, and Emergency Management
       with Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High Yield Explosive (CBRNE)
       inputs using the Chemical Down Wind (CDM) and Effective Downwind (EDM)
       Messages and wind data as requested.
       4.7.6.10. Contact the 26 OWS/CU and pass on pertinent information as necessary.
4.8. METWATCH. METWATCH provides an organized approach for weather personnel to
maintain situational awareness of the current/future meteorological situation within a designated
area(s). This process involves notifying supported units and updating any forecast products
when pre-established weather conditions or unforecasted changes (timing, location or forecast
values) in weather occur or are expected to occur. All on-site meteorological and commercial
data sources (METSAT [Meteorological Satellite], weather radar, websites, National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] Weather Radio, etc.) may be used to accomplish this
task. The 26 OWS/CU will perform a continuous Terminal METWATCH for KAFB with
Weather Forecasters acting as the “eyes forward” for the 26 OWS/CU by providing immediate
feedback on current or short-term anticipated changes in weather conditions. The 26 OWS/CU
will also perform Flight and Route METWATCH for transient flights they briefed; which are
departing from KAFB. Weather Operations/EU will perform Flight and Route METWATCH for
transient flights departing KAFB that were briefed by Weather Forecasters. Note: Though
similar to MISSIONWATCH (Paragraph 3.6.), transient missions (cross country, etc.) are not
considered “local,” though the mission’s origins may have started/ended at KAFB.
   4.8.1. At a minimum, METWATCH procedures will consist of the following:
       4.8.1.1. Weather Forecasters will monitor conditions at KBIX, KGPT, KMOB, KJAN,
       and KMXF; 26 OWS/CU and SPC hazard charts; Space Weather forecasts;
       SIGMETs/PIREPs and Lightning data from various sources (e.g., AFW-WEBS, FMQ-
       19)..
       4.8.1.2. Weather Forecasters will METWATCH for Forecast specification and
       amendment criteria as detailed in Attachment 9 of this instruction; watch, warning and
       advisory criteria as outlined in Chapter 7 of this instruction; and hurricane/tropical storm
       advisory criteria.
       4.8.1.3. When Weather Forecasters are supplementing or backing up the AN/FMQ-19
       AMOS, they will recheck weather conditions, at intervals not to exceed 20 minutes since
KEESLERAFBI15-101 22 MAY 2013                                                                 27


       the last observation/recheck, when any of the criteria below are observed or forecast to
       occur within 1 hour:
           4.8.1.3.1. Ceiling decreases to less than or, if below, increases to equal or exceed
           1,500 feet. Use PIREPs to aid in determining ceiling heights.
           4.8.1.3.2. Prevailing Visibility (be it from Tower or Weather) decreases to less than,
           or if below, increases to equal or exceed 3SM.
           4.8.1.3.3. Precipitation (any form).
           4.8.1.3.4. Fog or Mist.
           4.8.1.3.5. Thunderstorm or lightning activity within 5NM of Keesler AFB.
           4.8.1.3.6. Conditions that require a SPECI.
       4.8.1.4. When forecast conditions change during the METWATCH, Weather Forecasters
       will notify Weather Operations/EU Mission Weather Element Weather Forecaster as well
       as the 26 OWS/CU KAFB duty Weather Forecasters at DSN 331-2622.
4.9. Eyes Forward Process/Procedure. This process/procedure is Weather Operations/EU role
in allowing for the integration of weather data, meteorological satellite imagery, lightning
detection readouts and non-standard weather data systems to create an integrated weather picture
and near-term forecast for the 26 OWS/CU. Weather Operations/EU provides meaningful
meteorological information not contained in the coded observations to the 26 OWS/CU as an
integral part of the METWATCH process (phone calls, emails, etc.). Additionally, Weather
Operations/EU integrates the current state of the atmosphere into an understanding of future
impacts on the forecast conditions and communicates these impacts to the 26 OWS/CU, as
needed.
4.10. Wet Bulb Globe Temperature Index (WBGTI). WBGTI is a predictor of physiological
strain in hot environments. It takes into account the effects of humidity, air speed, air
temperature and the radiant heating factor (from the sun). The WBGTI is not the same as the
Heat Index.
   4.10.1. The 81 TRW Bio-Environmental Flight will calculate and disseminate the WBGTI to
   the Blake Fitness Center and the Keesler CP IAW AETCI 48-101, Prevention of Heat Stress
   Disorders, and Keesler AFB Sup 1. This information is disseminated from 0800L to 1630L
   Monday through Thursday and non-NTD Fridays. The Blake Fitness Center will provide
   back-up calculation and dissemination on weekends, NTD Fridays and holidays. The
   WBGTI reading can be obtained from the KAFB Homepage. If WBGTI is above the green
   flag status at 1630L, WBGTI will continue to be monitored until a green flag status is
   reached.
4.11. Aircraft Mishaps. In the event that Weather Operations/EU is notified of an aircraft
mishap, the following procedures will be followed:
   4.11.1. Complete all actions of Tab A and/or Tab B to Appendix 2 of 81 TRW CEMP 10-2
   in the Emergency Actions Binder.
   4.11.2. Begin an Events Status Log, found in the Emergency Actions Binder.
   4.11.3. Determine the call sign of the downed aircraft from Base-ops or the Command Post.

   4.11.4. Conduct OPUP data save for one hour before and one hour after the mishap.
   4.11.5. Print out and save electronically the most current satellite (WV, Visual and IR)
   picture.
   4.11.6. Make copies of all products, numerical, graphical, etc used to create the flight
   weather briefing, to include any PMSV contact between METRO and the mishap aircrew.
   4.11.7. Collect the TAFs and observations for departure point, destination and any
   alternate(s).Collect any information from five (5) hours before to one (1) hour after the
   mishap occurred. Taking an observation for Keesler AFB is only mandatory when the FMQ-
   19 is INOP or you are Supplementing/Backing Up. In that case, an observations would have
   been taken immediately upon notification as an Aircraft Mishap SPECI, and identify the
   observation by including (ACFT MSHP) in remarks on the AF Form 3803/3813 only.
   4.11.8. Create a CD with the data collected electronically.
   4.11.9. Collect the upper air sounding(s) in route and nearest the mishap site. Print a copy of
   each of these locations.
   4.11.10. Make a copy of all watches, warnings and advisories for KBIX.
   4.11.11. Only notify AFWA team chief (DSN 271-2586) of the Mishap/Accident to request
   they initiate a data save for data that we cannot find or save.
   4.11.12. Notify 26 OWS/CU (DSN: 331-2622) to initiate data-save procedures for any
   OWS/CU products we use to prepare the flight weather briefing for any weather related or
   ground mishaps requiring Operational Report 3 (OPREP-3).
   4.11.13. Make a copy of all data that will be given to the Safety Office. (This is done to
   ensure we have a copy of all materials). Give this to the Lead Forecaster.
   4.11.14. Place all data in an envelope and label it with the aircraft call sign, date, office
   symbol, and office phone number. A member of the 81 OSF staff will deliver the envelope
   to the Safety Office, and be prepared to brief the Safety Investigation Board on daily weather
   conditions expected during the investigation. Note: Do not release the names of personnel
   involved in an aircraft mishap. Refer all inquiries from non-mishap response personnel to
   Public Affairs.
4.12. Weather Sensors. Upon notification from ATC of a completed runway change, Weather
Operations/EU will change the appropriate weather sensors to match the active runway.
4.13. Weather Equipment. Weather Operations/EU has sensors to measure cloud base heights,
wind direction and speed, atmospheric pressure, rainfall, Runway Visual Range, visibility
atmospheric phenomenon, dew point and ambient air temperature. Weather equipment will be
discussed further in Chapter 9.
4.14. Keesler AFB five (5)-Day Forecast. Every day that Weather Operations/EU is open,
forecasters will produce a five (5) Day forecast presentation for Keesler AFB by 0730L Mon-Fri,
1100L Sat-Sun, and 1200L on UTA Sunday. This product is created for non-operational use only
and is not amended. This product is posted in the CSC Weather folder under the Keesler public
page on Outlook. The five (5) Day forecast is created as a Power Point presentation and includes
slides for: weather graphic of today’s weather for the U.S., satellite loop of the U.S., radar loop
of the U.S., weather graphic for tomorrow’s weather for the U.S., five (5) Day forecast for
KEESLERAFBI15-101 22 MAY 2013                                                                  29


Keesler AFB and the monthly climatology of Keesler AFB. During hurricane season (1 Jun - 30
Nov), a tropical satellite image of the Atlantic Ocean and storm tracks for any tropical systems
affecting Keesler AFB will be provided. The five (5) Day Forecast is provided to Keesler AFB
units for use to plan their activities over the next five days. If more specific weather forecasts
are needed, base agencies can contact Weather Operations/EU at 377-3305/4397. See
Attachment 7 for an example of the Keesler AFB 5 Day Forecast.
4.15. Hurricane Bulletin. Weather Operations/EU will use the tropical cyclone forecast issued
by the 26th OWS/CU TC-TAP program via NHC. Weather Operations/EU will then use the
HURRTRAK program graphics portion of the Keesler AFB Hurricane Bulletin. No deviation
from the official forecast position, track, movement, maximum wind speed, or intensity trend is
authorized. Weather Operations/EU will use the Mission Execution Forecast Process (MEFP) to
tailor the official tropical cyclone forecasts into a specific mission forecast product for our
supported customers. Tailoring may include factors such as specific local effects such as terrain
or relative position to the storm. This bulletin is normally sent to base agencies via email. If
email is down, Weather Operations/EU will send the bulletin via fax or runner to the Command
Post.
   4.15.1. The Hurricane Bulletin is provided for non-operational use only and will only be
   created during the hours that Weather Operations/EU is open. The bulletins do not provide
   any guidance on evacuating time tables or HURCON recommendations. That information
   will be provided to Wing leadership, and decisions on evacuating or HURCON changes will
   come from the Wing Commander. The bulletin contains the following sections: title section
   (storm category, name, bulletin number and the date and time the bulletin is valid for), map
   and legend (map includes: current location, forecast track, cone of uncertainty and any
   watches or warnings valid), current information (position, movement, current category, wind
   speeds, location from Keesler AFB, closest point of approach (CPA) of Keesler AFB, and
   any watches or warnings for the Keesler AFB area), storm information (information on the
   storm, effects on Keesler AFB and landfall forecast) and other information (HURCON and
   hurricane category descriptions). See Attachment 6 for an example of the Keesler AFB
   Hurricane Bulletin
   4.15.2. HurrWatch Team Briefings. Weather Operations/EU will provide the most up-to-
   date weather briefings regarding any tropical cyclone activity anytime deemed necessary by
   Keesler Disaster Response Force (DRF). This information will be relayed to the DRF upon
   request. The HurrWatch briefing location will be determined by the DRF coordinator.
   Adequate time will be provided by HurrWatch team members for Weather Operations/EU to
   evaluate the latest National Hurricane Center (NHC) advisory (dissemination times vary),
   compile and prepare other pertinent information like divert base forecasts, and provide
   meteorological input/advice. The NHC advisories provide the “official forecast” information
   and will not be deviated from when briefing base leadership, etc. These advisories will
   provide the foundation for Weather Operations/EU forecast products (wind, sea conditions,
   etc.). Weather Operations/EU forecast inputs, however, may provide additional guidance to
   senior leadership based on their experience and training. Refer to the 81 TRW PLAN 10-2,
   Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) for further guidance.

indoctrination training and initial weather certification to ATC personnel assigned to 81 OSF,
IAW AFI 13-203, Air Traffic Control. After ATC personnel complete the training, they will take
a short test on the information and receive a familiarization tour of the weather station. ATC and
other agencies requiring similar training should contact Weather Operations/EU leadership at
377-3938/0486 to schedule an appointment.
5.5. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC) Briefings. Weather Operations/EU provides IRC
briefings as required by course scheduling in accordance with AFMAN 11-210, Instrument
Refresher Program (IRP), and AFMAN 15-129V2. The weather portion of the briefing consists
of an overview of Weather Operations/EU, Airfield and Mission Services, Weather
Operations/EU capabilities, Weather Operations/EU and OWS/CU responsibilities, resource
protection, seasonal/regional weather, space weather impacts and procedures for obtaining
weather support at other locations.
5.6. Supervisor of Flying Briefings. IAW AFI 11-418 and AETC Sup 1, Weather
Operations/EU will present upcoming seasonal weather challenges at quarterly SOF/DUTY
OFFICER briefings. This will also be the venue to address SOF/DUTY OFFICER weather
support issues.
5.7. Disaster Response Force (DRF) Briefings. Weather Operations/EU will provide weather
briefings as required for DRF meetings. This includes exercises, hurricane (HurrWatch Team
support), deployment briefings, etc. Each briefing will be tailored to provide the appropriate
weather intelligence required by wing leadership. The 81 TRW PLAN 10-2, CEMP outlines
specifics on Emergency/Crisis Action Response as well as Force Protection and Emergency
Actions resulting from weather events/natural disasters.
   5.7.1. Pre-deployment Planning.        Per KAFB Deployment Plan 10-403, Weather
   Operations/EU will brief all available weather information to include forecasts and
   climatology for the local area, Aerial Port of Embarkation (APOE), Area of Responsibility
   (AOR) and Aerial Port of Debarkation (APOD)/Final Destination (DEST) at the deployment
   concept briefing. If there is no concept briefing, Weather Operations/EU will relay

   information to the Installation Deployment Officer (IDO) and/or Deployment Control Center
   (DCC) as requested.
5.8. Climatology Briefings. Climatology information will be provided as requested.
Additionally, monthly climatology will be presented at Wing staff meetings.
5.9. Flight Information Publication (FLIP) Weather Updates. Weather Operations/EU is
responsible for ensuring all weather information in the FLIP is accurate. All weather related
updates will be requested through the Base Operations FLIP Manager (Airfield Manager), 81
OSF/AM. The Flip manager will process the information to AFFSA/OL-D. Updates will fall in
one of three categories: revisions, changes or corrections.

                      SPACE WEATHER SUPPORT AND SERVICES

6.1. General. Many KAFB/USAF communications systems use sky wave and transionospheric
propagation (High Frequency [HF], Very High Frequency [VHF], Ultra High Frequency [UHF]
and Satellite Communications [SATCOM]); which can be rendered useless by electromagnetic
radiation from the sun. This chapter contains some brief information regarding space weather
limitations, alerts and warnings and products available to Keesler personnel.
6.2. Limitations. Like terrestrial weather, there are numerous factors that influence space
weather. One of the biggest limitations we have in identifying and forecasting space weather is a
lack of sensors/data. Additionally, given the speed of solar wind and light, our ability to provide
useful lead-times for significant space events is extremely limited.
6.3. Space Weather Alerts and Warnings. Broad coverage CONUS-based space weather
products               (graphics)                 are               available                at
https://weather.afwa.af.mil/jaawin/space/spacePages.jsp?region=CONUS            or Weather
Operations/EU /26 OWS/CU web pages and will be used to update the space weather portion
(HF and UHF) of the MEF as well as entry #15 (Space Weather) of the DD Form 175-1. GPS
Communication will be monitored hourly for specific missions upon request (see Chapter 6.4.).
Additionally, Space Weather Impacts will be reported through the appropriate link on this site.
Bulletins        are         available         through          26        OWS/CU             at

6.4. Products. Numerous space weather products are available from JAAWIN (see links
above). Most Space Weather products from the strategic center are ―now-casts‖ and/or very
short-term forecasts (6-hourly periods), so Mission Weather Element must check websites for
updated products (remember to hit refresh on your browser) at least twice throughout their shift
and update the FAMEF. For more information concerning these products, please contact the Air
Force Weather Agency Weather Operations/EU.
   6.4.1. GPS Products. GPS products are primarily “now-casts” and/or <1 hourly forecast.
   Due to the frequent refresh rate of these products, Mission Weather Element will only need
   to monitor these products when requested by the customer.                              See

                                            Chapter 7

                           RESOURCE PROTECTION SERVICES

7.1. General. Certain weather conditions endanger property or life, pose a safety hazard or
adversely impact operations. This chapter contains details on how the Weather Operations/EU
/26 OWS/CU team monitors these phenomena and issues weather watches, warnings and
advisories for significant events that are occurring or are expected to occur. Resource protection
is accomplished through a joint effort between the 26 OWS/CU and Keesler Weather
Operations/EU. The 26 OWS/CU is responsible for issuing all forecasted weather watches and
warnings. Weather Operations/EU acts as the “eyes forward” for the 26 OWS/CU and is
responsible for issuing all observed warnings, advisories (annotated on the appropriate AF Form
3806, Weather Watch Advisory Log, and AF Form 3807, Watch/Warning Notification and
Verification). However, Weather Operations/EU can issue any forecasted warning if there is an
immediate threat to life and/or property. In these cases, Weather Operations/EU will back brief
the 26 OWS/CU when time permits and will also be responsible for dissemination to local
supported agencies.        Conversely, Weather Operations/EU will act as the alternate
dissemination/notification source for the 26 OWS/CU. The goal is to provide the best possible
resource protection to KAFB. If needed, the 26 OWS/CU will be the point for backup support
for the Keesler Weather Operations/EU during severe weather conditions.
   7.1.1. Commanders must be familiar with weather watch, warning and advisory criteria that
   affect their operations or personnel and ensure that the notification is passed to the lowest
   level in their unit that may require the notification for personal safety and resource
   protection.
   7.1.2. Weather watches, warnings and advisories are disseminated by the 26 OWS/CU or
   Weather Operations/EU via the ADS. A follow-up call is made to the Keesler CP and ATC
   tower to ensure receipt. See Attachment 10 for specific product format and interpretation.
7.2. Weather Watches. A weather watch is a special notice sent to customers indicating that
conditions are favorable for the development of a particular type of weather phenomena (e.g.,
tornadoes, hail, etc.). It provides advanced notification of a potential for weather conditions that
could pose a hazard to life or property for which the customer must take protective action.
Watches are issued for a 5NM radius of KAFB
   7.2.1. The 26 OWS/CU issues weather watches for KAFB. Watches normally precede
   warnings.
   7.2.2. All units on KAFB will, at a minimum, review their protective action procedures
   when watches are issued.
   7.2.3.

Table 7.1. contains all of the weather watches and desired lead-times issued for KAFB.

   visibility frequently < 1/4SM. All conditions must be met.
   * Denotes a Weather Watch in which, if issued, requires implementation of the Severe
   Weather Action Procedures (SWAP) outlined in Chapter 7.8..

7.3. Weather Warnings. Weather warnings are special notices sent out to customers alerting
them that a predefined weather event, of such intensity to pose a threat to life or property (such
as lightning, tornadoes, etc.), is expected to occur or is occurring. Warnings are issued for a
5NM radius of KAFB.
   7.3.1. The 26 OWS/CU issues weather warnings for KAFB (with the exception of the
   observed lightning warnings that are issued by Weather Operations/EU when forecasters are
   on duty).
   7.3.2. All units will complete their protective actions upon receipt of weather warnings.
   7.3.3.

Table 7.2. contains all of the weather warnings and desired lead-times issued for Keesler
AFB.

      .* Denotes a Weather Warning in which, if issued, requires implementation of the
      Severe Weather Action Procedures outlined in Paragraph 7.8..

7.4. Weather Advisories. Weather advisory is a special notice provided to supported customers
that alerts them to weather conditions that could affect their operations on KAFB. Advisories are
issued for a 5NM radius of KAFB. Two types of advisories are issued: observed weather
advisories and forecasted weather advisories.
   7.4.1. Observed Weather Advisory. Weather advisory issued when the customer does not
   require advanced notification of a particular weather phenomenon.
   7.4.2. Forecast Weather Advisory. Weather advisory issued when the customer requires
   advance notification of an impending condition with sufficient time to allow protective
   actions to be taken.
   7.4.3. Table 7.3. list all weather advisories issued for Keesler AFB. The table includes when
   the advisory is issued and by what agency. Each agency will provide back-up services to the
   other when they do not have the capabilities to issue their required advisory.

Table 7.3. Weather Advisory Criteria and Minimum Desired Lead-Times.
  Criteria                                                          Desired Lead-Time
  Winds 25 to < 35 kts         (26 OWS//CU Responsibility)          30 minutes
  Temp <32°F for more than 2 hours (26 OWS/CU 12 hours
  Responsibility)
  Non-Convective Low Level Wind Shear (Issue only when 30 minutes
  airfield is open)( 26 OWS/CU Responsibility)
  Temp < 40°F (Issue only when airfield is open)                    Observed
  (KBOS/WSO/EU Responsibility)

7.5. Dissemination and Numbering. Watches, warnings and advisories will be numbered
consecutively for an entire month by identifying the type of weather message (watch, warning or
advisory) followed by a five-digit number. The first two numbers indicate the current month
while the second three numbers indicate the sequence number. For example, the message
KEESLERAFBI15-101 22 MAY 2013                                                                37


“Weather Warning 02-005” means the month is February (02), and this is the fifth (005) warning
issued in the month. The message “Weather Advisory 12-013” means the month is December
(12), and this is the thirteenth (013) issued in the month. See Attachment 10 for examples.
Note: The AF Form 3806 and/or AF Form 3807 will be filled out by Airfield Services Element.
   7.5.1. Upgrades/Downgrades. Advisories and warnings will be upgraded (i.e., winds
   increase from 35 knots to 50 knots) or downgraded as required. Upgrades should meet the
   desired lead-times specified above. Only one forecasted warning, excluding the observed
   lightning warnings, may be in effect at one time. If a warning is issued for one criterion,
   and it becomes necessary to warn for another criterion, a new warning, with a new number,
   will be issued to include all criteria expected. A separate valid time may be specified for
   each criterion, if necessary.
   7.5.2. Extensions or Changes. An extension or change will be issued to change the valid
   times or duration of a watch, warning or advisory.
   7.5.3. Cancellation. Watches and warnings may be cancelled when the weather phenomena
   are no longer occurring or expected to occur. However, if not cancelled, they will expire at
   the end of the valid period. Observed advisories will be cancelled when the criteria is no
   longer occurring and is not expected to occur again in the next hour. The lightning warning
   and watch will always be cancelled when no longer expected.
7.6. Toxic Corridor. Per AFI 10-2501, toxic corridor responsibility lies with the Fire
Protection Flight with assistance from the Bioenvironmental Flight. Weather Operations/EU will
provide weather data necessary to calculate Toxic Corridors to the Fire Protection Flight and/or
the disaster control group, as requested. The 26 OWS/CU may supplement meteorological data
to the appropriate Keesler organizations if requested and Weather Operations/EU is unable to
provide the data.
7.7. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP).
   7.7.1. SWAP Notification and Response. The purpose of the SWAP is to ensure weather
   station management (senior, experienced personnel) are notified and respond to both
   potential and/or actual severe weather events within Keesler’s area of responsibility. SWAP
   activation criteria may include any watch/warning criteria (see Tables 7.1.-7.3.), but will
   primarily be used for Severe Thunderstorm watches/warnings: Tornadoes/funnel clouds,
   winds > 50kts, hail > 3/4 inches, heavy rain/snow, freezing precipitation and/or blizzards.
   During non-duty hours, the 26 OWS/CU along with the CP will contact the Keesler Standby
   Weather Forecaster when the 26 OWS/CU issues, upgrades or cancels a watch or warning
   (does not include lightning watches/warnings or advisories) and recall the Keesler standby
   Weather Forecaster when a severe weather watch or warning is issued. SWAP activation
   discretion lies with the on-duty Airfield Services using their experience and guidance from
   Weather Operations/EU leadership, including coordination with the 26 OWS/CU (team effort
   between Weather Operations/EU and 26 OWS/CU). Further SWAP details are provided in
   Weather Operations/EU SWAP SOP. Note: Weather Operations/EU operational support
   may be limited to all base units/customers during severe weather events due to limited
   manning and availability. Limitations to customer support may include: Weather
   Forecasters answer only telephone hotlines, shortened/cancelled weather briefings, long
   telephone hold periods, slower updates to various FAMEFs, etc.
 38                                                     KEESLERAFBI15-101 22 MAY 2013


   7.7.2. SWAP Activation Conditions. Once Airfield Services Element expects SWAP
   activation conditions to occur, he/she will notify the Severe Weather Action Team (SWAT)
   leader via phone call (see Weather Operations/EU monthly work schedule for current SWAT
   leader and contact information…updated, as needed, by Weather Operations/EU Lead
   Forecaster), follow the SWAP SOPs, and coordinate with the Keesler Weather Forecaster at
   the 26 OWS/CU. Once contacted, the SWAT leader will determine whether to activate the
   team. If deemed appropriate, the SWAT leader will report to Weather Operations/EU as
   soon as possible (30 minutes ideally) and may call in additional forecasters to assist. The 26
   OWS/CU will provide backup SWAT support for Weather Operations/EU in the event of
   communication failure, equipment outages, forecaster unavailability, etc. Per AFI 10-229,
   Responding to Severe Weather Events, Weather Operations/EU and 26 OWS/CU will jointly
   conduct and document a semi-annual exercise. Real world severe weather events can be
   used in place of these exercises.
   7.7.3. Procedures Before and During Potential Severe Weather. Airfield Services Element
   will keep the SWAT standby person/leader informed of the potential for severe weather.
   They will immediately notify the SWAT leader whenever the potential for a severe
   thunderstorm moves within 100NM of KAFB and/or is expected to affect KAFB within four
   (4) hours. The SWAT leader and Airfield Services Element will discuss, analyze and assess
   the severe weather threat in conjunction with the 26 OWS/CU Keesler Weather Forecasters
   by reviewing pertinent meteorological information. The goal is to commit earlier and issue
   severe weather watches and warnings based more on severe weather indicators and less on
   actual sightings. If the SWAT leader, 26 OWS/CU Weather Forecaster and Airfield Services
   Element determine there is a risk for severe weather, they will implement a contingent of the
   team, as needed. Otherwise, Airfield Services Element will return to normal operations.
   7.7.4. Task Assignments. Once the team is in place (60 minute ideal recall for augmenters),
   the SWAT leader will assign tasks (monitor weather radar, answer telephones, etc.) and
   ensure special attention is paid to Weather Operations/EU Duty Priorities (Chapter 1.4.2.).
   The members will dedicate their efforts to their assigned tasks and keep the team leader
   updated on events. Airfield Services Element will maintain primary focus on the changing
   weather scenario and will coordinate (26 OWS/CU, SWAT leader) a final decision on which
   weather products to issue. Mission Weather Element will enhance MISSIONWATCH
   procedures and contact SOF/Duty Officer’s and Duty Desks with any updates necessary.
   7.7.5. Response Actions. 81 TRW Severe Weather response actions are outlined in the 81
   TRW PLAN 10-2, CEMP.
   7.7.6. Post-Event Procedures. Once the SWAT leader, 26 OWS/CU Weather Forecaster and
   Airfield Services Element have determined the severe weather threat has passed, the SWAT
   leader will ensure Weather Operations/EU is returned to “ops normal” (ensure work area is
   clean, answer/return any pending phone calls, report any severe weather damage [see
   OPREPs, Chapter 7.11.], etc.) before dismissing the SWAT. Any changes to the SWAP
   procedure will be documented in this instruction (annotated on Weather Operations/EU
   master copy prior to the update) and in Weather Operations/EU SWAP SOP.
7.8. Hurricane/Tropical Storm Bulletin Criteria. Hurricane/tropical storm bulletins are
issued whenever a tropical storm or hurricane is within or is forecasted to be within 720NM and
has the potential for significant impact on KAFB, or by direction of 81 TRW or KBOS/WSO/EU
KEESLERAFBI15-101 22 MAY 2013                                                                 39


leadership. The main purpose of the bulletin is to alert base agencies of the potential for winds
50 knots or greater within 72, 48, 24 or 12 hours respectively at KAFB. These special advisories
are based on the National Hurricane Center (NHC) forecasts and outlined in AFI 10-2501. The
NHC website is http://www.nhc.noaa.gov. Information will include current storm location,
movement, and wind speeds along with forecast positions and wind speeds and will be available
at 0400, 1000, 1600 and 2200L, unless there is a change to the forecast. Intermediate special
forecasts will be issued whenever there is a hurricane or tropical storm watch or warning issued.
When briefing Wing leadership, there will be no deviations from the official NHC positions,
track, movement, and maximum wind speed or intensity trend. Due to the uncertainty of the 72
and 48-hour outlooks, they should be used for planning purposes only (96 and 120-hour forecast
positions may also be provided). NHC advisories (official forecast information) are the core of
Weather Operations/EU input to the HurrWatch Team (Paragraph 4.16.2.). NHC data, however,
may be used to tailor Keesler forecast products (FAMEFs) with special consideration being
given to local terrain effects (funneling, bay effects, etc.). HURCON definitions are as follows:
   7.8.1. HURCON 5: Signals it is currently hurricane season and/or a general state of
   preparedness (1 Jun-30 Nov).
   7.8.2. HURCON 4: 50 kts/ 58 miles per hour (mph) winds or higher within 72 hours.
   7.8.3. HURCON 3: 50 kts/58 miles per hour (mph) winds or higher within 48 hours.
   7.8.4. HURCON 2: 50 kts/58 miles per hour (mph) winds or higher within 24 hours.
   7.8.5. HURCON 1: 50 kts/58 miles per hour (mph) winds or higher within 12 hours.
   7.8.6. Weather Operations/EU /26 OWSCU will augment the NHC forecasts to include the
   following:
       7.8.6.1. Onset of crosswinds and weather phenomena or conditions expected that could
       prevent evacuation of aircraft.
       7.8.6.2. Weather Operations/EU provides forecasts to the DRF/commanders and
       recommends HURCON levels to the installation commander; who is the declaring
       authority. See 81 TRW PLAN 10-2, CEMP for more hurricane information.
       7.8.6.3. Weather Operations/EU will notify the installation commander when a tropical
       system is developing in the Gulf of Mexico or forecast to move into the Gulf. Based on
       the official forecast and the situation, Weather Operations/EU can recommend the DRF
       to convene.
   7.8.7. Disseminating Hurricane Information. When an active tropical system is within or
   forecast to be within 720NM of KAFB and has the potential for significant impact on KAFB,
   or by direction of 81 TRW and KBOS/WSO/EU leadership. Weather Operations/EU will
   issue the Hurricane Bulletin via email. At a minimum, the Hurricane Bulletin will be sent to
   the Keesler Hurricane Bulletin e-mail address list. Individual agencies will ensure the
   bulletin is disseminated throughout their organizations.
7.9. Chemical, Biological, Radiological Nuclear, and High Yield Explosive Data
(CBRNE). The 81 ID/IDF (Fire Protection Flight) is the primary unit for providing CBRNE
support. The CDM and EDM are used to determine the spread CBRNE of agents that are
released. The EDM bulletin is produced by AFWA and is used for forecasting threat areas for
fallout from nuclear detonation. The CDN is available at both AFWA and the 26th OWS/CU.
 40                                                     KEESLERAFBI15-101 22 MAY 2013


Per AFI 10-2501 Weather Operations/EU is responsible for providing only meteorological data
towards the calculation of Toxic Corridor products. The 26th OWS/CU may also supplement
Weather Operations/EU with this weather data-only support, if required.
7.10. Severe Weather Damage Reporting/OPREPs. IAW AFMAN 15-129V2, AFI 10-229
and AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, Weather Operations/EU will query base cooperative
weather watch agencies (SF, Fire Dept, etc.), local spotters and online damage assessment data
sources (NWS, local news, local law enforcement, etc.) to collect the area impacts of severe
weather events (on base or in the immediate surrounding areas) as time permits after a severe
weather occurrence. Weather Operations/EU will coordinate with CP for weather related
Operational Report 3 (OPREP-3) and provide the CP with any pertinent base information. The
CP, in turn, will provide Weather Operations/EU with an unclassified copy of any weather
related OPREPs. Weather Operations/EU will provide damage reports and OPREP-3s to the 26
OWS/CU and AETC/A30W and CP will provide OPREP-3s to Higher Headquarters as soon as
possible. Note: The 81 TRW/CC is the releasing authority for OPREP-3s.
   7.10.1. Information required to be provided by Weather Operations/EU to the CP includes:
       7.10.1.1. Date/time and type of actual severe weather experienced.
       7.10.1.2. Forecast valid at the time of occurrence.
       7.10.1.3. Any watches, warnings issued (include actual and desired lead times).
       7.10.1.4. Operational status of meteorological equipment (radar, wind sensors, etc.) at
       both the WSO/EU and the 26 OWS/CU.

                     WEATHER INFORMATION DISSEMINATION

8.1. General. Forecasts, observations, and weather alerts (warnings, watches, and advisories)
are useful only if the customers have access to them. Timely and efficient dissemination of
weather information is crucial to the success of the wing mission and resource protection. Most
organizations will receive this information via our primary dissemination system. Some
organizations will receive courtesy calls, however, AFI 10-229, Responding to Severe Weather
Events, restricts the number of organizations Weather Operations/EU can directly notify (via
telephone) in order to focus on incoming weather phenomena. This chapter describes the
weather dissemination systems, dissemination procedures and backup systems and procedures.
8.2. Dissemination Systems and Backups.
   8.2.1. Automated Dissemination System. In this publication, Automated Dissemination
   System (ADS) refers to any Air Force or Army accredited dissemination system (e.g., Joint
   Environmental Toolkit (JET)). The ADS is the primary method for dissemination of
   observations, forecasts, warnings, watches and advisories. Agencies without access to the
   ADS will receive critical weather information through their unit’s own dissemination system
   (e.g., Pyramid Alert Recall, Unit Control Center, etc.). In the event that the ADS is
   inoperable Weather Operations/EU will use the backup procedures listed in section 8.3..
   8.2.2. Local Area Network (LAN). The LAN is the primary method used for gathering
   weather information. Additionally, it is used as the backup system for disseminating (long-
   line only) weather observations. In the event of a LAN outage, Weather Operations/EU has
   obtained the use of a cable modem through the local cable company to link to the internet.
   When using the cable modem, Weather Operations/EU will be limited on its use of some
   military internet sites and will not have email services available.
   8.2.3. Hotlines. Hotlines have been installed between KBOS/WSO/EU and other agencies
   for the sole purpose of rapidly exchanging weather data. Normal phone lines will be used in
   the event of a hotline outage. Table 8.1 outlines hotlines that are installed between Weather
   Operations/EU and the following agencies (DSN Prefix 597, Comm. 377):

Table 8.1. Hotlines Weather Operations/EU.
 Control Tower                   377-3227
 Command Post                    377-4330
 81 TRW Commander                377-2010

   8.2.4. Climatic Data Requests. Upon Request from an authorized agency (as deemed
   appropriate by station management), weather personnel will provide climatology data for
   KAFB and other locations. Request may be made by phone, e-mail, letter, or in person.
   Monthly climatology will be made available to the following agencies in Table 8.2.

8.3. Dissemination and Backup Procedures.
   8.3.1. TAFs. TAFs will be entered and disseminated through the ADS. If the ADS is out of
   service then Weather Operations/EU will disseminate the information locally via standard
   telephone lines/fax to the CP and ATC Tower.
   8.3.2. Observations Procedures. Observations will be taken and disseminated through the
   ADS. When the ADS is out of service, observations will be disseminated long-line through
   JAAWIN or AFW-WEBS using the LAN. If both the ADS and the LAN are out of service,
   long-line dissemination will also be through JAAWIN using a dedicated cable connection not
   associated with the LAN. If all long-line transmission resources are out of service,
   observations will be called out via telephone (voice relay) to any other weather station or
   supporting hub (Barksdale AFB, LA) for long-line transmission. Locally, observations will
   be relayed by Weather Operations/EU to the following organizations (noted on a local
   dissemination log) in order of priority when the ADS is out of service:
      8.3.2.1. Tower (Hotline or 377-8877).
      8.3.2.2. Keesler CP (Hotline or 377-4330)
      8.3.3. Gulfport Tower (228-864-3760).
   8.3.4. WBGTI. The WBGTI will be disseminated locally by the Bio-environmental Flight
   on duty days or the Blake Fitness Center on non-duty days.
   8.3.5. Weather Watches, Warnings and Advisories. Weather watches, warnings and
   advisories will be disseminated via the ADS. When warnings are issued, the 26 OWS/CU or
   Weather Operations/EU will give a courtesy call to the CP. Weather Operations/EU will also
   give the KAFB Tower a courtesy call to ensure receipt. If the ADS is out of service, the 26
   OWS/CU and/or Weather Operations/EU will contact the same organizations via telephone.
   Further dissemination by Weather Operations/EU, Base Operations and the Command Post is
   as follows:
KEESLERAFBI15-101 22 MAY 2013                                                             43


      8.3.5.1. 81st Training Group Commander (81 TRG) Notification.             Weather
      Operations/EU will notify by phone the 81 TRG Commander (TRG/CC) of all watches
      and warnings, excluding lighting and NTDs, Monday thru Friday between the hours of
      0600L and 1800L. Weather Operations/EU will also notify the 81 TRSS/TSM Military
      Training Leaders (MTLs) will be notified of all lightning watches and warnings
      (excluding NTDs) between 0500L-0600L.
      8.3.5.2. Watch, Warning and Advisory Notifications. Watches, warnings and advisories
      will be further disseminated by the CP and Base Operations according to tables 8.3. and
      8.4.. Units listed will develop methods to notify subordinate agencies. Groups should
      use their 24-hour operations to recall other key personnel/units that are needed to
      implement resource protection plans.
      8.3.5.3. Airfield Management Operations. When required as a backup to the Keesler
      Alert Network (KAN), Airfield Management Operations relays all weather warnings via
      the secondary crash net to the following organizations outlined in Table 8.3. (if
      necessary, landlines are used for backup purposes):

                                 WEATHER EQUIPMENT

9.1. General. This chapter provides a brief description of the meteorological and
communications equipment used by Weather Operations/EU. Additionally, it provides
information on backup systems, maintenance and restoring priorities.
9.2. Weather Equipment. Weather Operations/EU uses a wide range of equipment to
determine the current state of the atmosphere. These critical systems are used continuously to
provide customers the most timely, accurate and relevant weather intelligence possible. KAFB
has a single-instrument runway with exception of the dual sensor wind and cloud measuring
equipment. Readouts for the observing equipment are located in the Weather Operations/EU
area.
   9.2.1. AN/FMQ-19 Automated Meteorological Observing System (AMOS). The AN/FMQ-
   19 AMOS is the primary airfield weather observation system capable of measuring wind
   speed/direction, temperature/dew point, pressure, prevailing visibility/present weather, cloud
   ceiling heights, precipitation amounts, freezing rain detection and lightning strike detection.
   Sensors are located on the airfield and information is displayed in Weather Operations/EU.
   Backup for the AN/FMQ-19 AMOS is the Kestrel 4000 (wind speed, temperature/dew point,
   pressure), AFW-WEBS (lightning strike detection) and a Weather Forecaster (clouds,
   visibility, atmospheric phenomena).
   9.2.2. Open Systems Principal User Processor (OPUP). The OPUP is a hardware/software
   system designed for the display and interrogation of Doppler radar imagery on a Graphical
   User Interface (GUI). The OPUP allows Weather Forecasters to display, locate and
   interrogate severe thunderstorms as well as tornadic activity. The Internet provides Weather
   Operations/EU t backup radar information. Control of the OPUP site belongs to the National
   Weather Service site in Slidell, LA NWS. Backup for the OPUP is Weather Tap radar
   display, JAAWIN radar display or other internet sites as applicable. The 26 OWS/CU will
   also provide backup support when needed.
   9.2.3. Automated Dissemination System (ADS). As discussed in Chapter 8, the ADS is the
   primary system for dissemination and is located in bldg 0233, room 109.
   9.2.4. PMSV Radio. The PMSV Radio (267.4 MHz) allows Weather Operations/EU to
   communicate with aircrews, both on the ground and in the air, as well as tower personnel. If
   the PMSV is out, Contact the ATC Tower and let them know that our PMSV is out. Ask
   them to inform aircrews trying to contact Keesler Metro that our PMSV is out and they will
   need to contact another location for assistance. Aircrews can contact the 26 OWS/CU via
   phone patch (DSN 331-2651 or COMM 318-529-2651) to get weather data.
   9.2.5. Phones/Hotlines. Phones and hotlines primarily serve as a backup system as well as
   for passing along Critical and time sensitive information rapidly.
   9.2.6. LAN. Weather Operations/EU relies heavily on the local area network to improve the
   timeliness and accuracy of weather intelligence to our customers. As a backup to the LAN,
   Weather Operations/EU has obtained a Cable Modem from a local cable company.
KEESLERAFBI15-101 22 MAY 2013                                                             47


   9.2.7. Kestrel 4000. The Kestrel 4000 is a hand held measuring device that measures
   Barometric Pressure, Altitude, Density Altitude, Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Wind
   Chill, Dew Point, Wet Bulb, and Heat Index. This instrument is used as the primary back up
   to the AN/FMQ-19 AMOS in the event of an outage.
   9.2.8. Lightning detection and prediction is accomplished by Forecasters by use of
   officially approved products and techniques. Among these are the AN/FMQ-19, official Air
   Force websites, and Doppler Weather Radar.
   9.2.9. Automated Dissemination System (ADS). An ADS has been installed and provides
   the users with a single, fully integrated system of weather analyses, forecasting and
   dissemination capabilities.
9.3. Maintenance. All equipment requires some sort of maintenance from time-to-time.
Weather data is obtained via leased commercial telephone lines, the Internet and satellite
download for ingest into the various weather systems.
   9.3.1. The 81 CS will maintain the following weather communications equipment around the
   clock. Response to weather communication equipment outages during other than normal
   duty hours will be based on mission impact. Communication systems that interface with
   commercial telephone companies will be coordinated and tracked by the 81 CS.
      9.3.1.1. PMSV.
      9.3.1.2. OPUP communications and modem.
      9.3.1.3. Class A/local telephone lines and phone lines connecting to weather equipment
      on the airfield.
      9.3.1.4. ADS communication lines.
      9.3.1.5. AN/FMQ-19 AMOS.
   9.3.2. 81 CS will respond to weather equipment or communication outages that prevent
   mission accomplishment within 30 minutes during normal duty hours and 45 minutes after
   duty hours, weekends and holidays. Equipment restoral priorities, reasoning and response
   times are listed in Table 9.1., in order of priority, highest to lowest. Deviations are
   authorized based on existing and forecast weather conditions as specified by a Weather
   Forecaster or Weather Operations/EU management.

                                         Chapter 10

            26 OWS/CU/ WEATHER OPERATIONS/EU BACKUP SUPPORT

10.1. General. There are dozens of scenarios that could cause an interruption of service from
either the 26 OWS/CU or Weather Operations. This chapter briefly describes how weather
services will be provided should any such events occur.
10.2. 26 OWS/CU.
   10.2.1. 26 OWS/CU Short-term Backup Weather Procedures. Per Datasheet when weather
   operations at the 26 OWS/CU are interrupted (e.g., power outage, natural disaster, etc.) and
   expected to be 72 hours or less, resource protection, TAF, weather watch and warning
   responsibility and transient flight briefing will be transferred to WSO/EU until the 26
   OWS/CU is prepared to resume operations. Another CONUS OWS/CU will produce the
   suite of Flight Weather Hazards and other products and services to the greatest extent
   possible as resources allow.
   10.2.2. 26 OWS/CU Long-term Backup Weather Procedures. Per Datasheet, when the
   interruption in weather operations at the 26 OWS/CU is expected to exceed 72 hours,
   weather responsibility for KAFB will transfer IAW AFMAN 15-129V1, Chapter 6. The 26
   OWS/CU will relocate to either AFWA or to another Continental United States (CONUS)
   OWS/CU. Once in place and operational, the 26 OWS/CU will resume support for KAFB to
   the greatest extent possible as resources allow.
10.3. Weather Operations. For standard station evacuations, support will resume from our
alternate weather operations site with the 26 OWS/CU assuming responsibilities during the
interim period. For longer interruptions, Weather Operations/EU will coordinate required
support with other organizations. Per Datasheet, the 26 OWS/CU will not normally produce and
disseminate tactical-level weather products for KAFB mission execution. However, when
operational constraints prevent WSO/EU from accomplishing the task, the 26 OWS/CU may
produce and disseminate selected tactical-level weather products (Web-Based FAMEFs, verbal

elements meet special criteria. All SPECIs shall be made as soon as possible after the relevant
criteria are observed.

Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF)—Weather forecast prepared by the 26th Operational
Weather Squadron/Characterization Unit (26th OWS/CU) composed of required weather
elements for Langley AFB airfield and covers a 30-hour period. Forecast elements in the
body of the forecast text refer to the area within 5NM of the center of the aerodrome complex.
Operationally significant elements outside this area are included in remarks (e.g., TS OMTNS
or VCTS). The term VC (vicinity) refers to the area between 5NM and 10NM of the
aerodrome complex.
Tornado Watch—Conditions are conducive to the development of tornadoes in and close to the
watch area.
Tornado Warning—A tornado has actually been sighted by spotters or indicated on radar and is
occurring or imminent in the warning area.
Weather Advisory—A special notice provided to a supported agency when an established
weather condition that could affect its operation is occurring or is expected to occur.
Weather Warning—A special notice provided to a supported agency when an established
weather condition of such intensity as to affect operations, pose a hazard to life or property, and
requires protective action, is occurring or is expected to occur.

             FORECAST SPECIFICATION AND AMENDMENT CRITERIA

A9.1. General. TAFs are forecasts of meteorological elements expected to occur at a specific
terminal. They are routinely prepared and are used for operational purposes. Specified in each
TAF (scheduled and amended) is the expected time of occurrence to the nearest hour (and
minute as appropriate), the expected duration, and intensity (where applicable) when certain
conditions are expected to occur.
   A9.1.1. Terms explained:
       A9.1.1.1. Terminal Aerodrome. The area within a 5SM radius of the KAFB runway
       complex.
       A9.1.1.2. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast. This is a forecast of required weather elements
       for a particular terminal aerodrome covering a 30-hour period. The TAF is a concise
       statement of the expected meteorological conditions at the terminal aerodrome during the
       specified period.
       A9.1.1.3. Vicinity. The area between 5SM and 10SM radius of the KAFB runway
       complex.
       A9.1.1.4. BECMG. The change indicator for the TAF. A change group of “BECMG
       1719” becomes valid at 19Z; “BECMG 1213” is valid at 13Z, etc.
       A9.1.1.5. TEMPO. This term indicates intermittent weather conditions for the TAF. A
       grouping of TEMPO 1519 indicates intermittent conditions will occur from 15Z-19Z.
       A9.1.1.6. FM. Is used to forecast a change expected to take place quickly over a period
       of less than 30 minutes. “FM13” becomes valid at 1300Z and expects the specified
       condition to take place by 1330Z.
       A9.1.1.7. Amendment. An unscheduled forecast which revises the current forecast.
A9.2. Amendments. TAFs may be amended at any time to ensure they are representative. The
2300L TAF will be marked “LIMITED METWATCH” since no Keesler Weather Forecaster will
be on duty during the hours noted after the remark. Amendments are valid for the period starting
the whole hour prior to the amendment and cover the remaining time of the original forecast.
   A9.2.1. The TAF will be amended when:
       A9.2.1.1. An unforecasted change which meets amendment criteria is expected to occur,
       or occurs, and is expected to last at least 30 minutes and is not correctly forecast by the
       next whole hour.
       A9.2.1.2. A forecast condition meeting amendment criteria does not occur by the
       specified hour and is not expected to occur within the next 30 minutes.
       A9.2.1.3. When a TEMPO group becomes predominant or is not expected to occur.
       A9.2.1.4. Anytime in the interest of flight safety.
   A9.2.2. Amendment Criteria:

                                     Categories are determined by the lower of the values.
                                     Notes: 1. Forecast category is determined by the lower
                                     ceiling or visibility value. 2. Use surface visibility to
                                     determine forecast category. 3. Substitute the lowest
                                     published airfield minimum for Ceiling/Visibility category
                                     A. (may require deletion of the B category at some airfields).
Surface Winds:                       Wind Speed: The difference between the predominant wind
                                     speed and the forecast wind speed is  10 knots and/or the
                                     difference between the observed gusts is  10 knots from the
                                     forecast gust. For example, amend a forecast specifying
                                     surface winds of 23018G25KT if observed predominant
                                     wind speed is 28 knots or more, or if the observed gusts are
                                     35 knots or higher. Similarly, amend the TAF if
                                     predominate winds are 8 knots or less, or gusts are 15 knots
                                     or less. Wind Direction: A change > 30 degrees when the
                                     predominant wind speed or gusts are expected to be over 15

          SAMPLE DISSEMINATION FORMATS AND INTERPRETATION

A10.1. Keesler AFB header and watch, warning or advisory number.
   A10.1.1. Watches, warnings and advisories will have a separate numbering system and will
   be formatted as MM-NNN. The first two digits (MM) will signify the month, and the last 3
   digits (NNN) will signify the watch, warning or advisory number. Example: The second
   advisory for the month of November would be 11-002.
   A10.1.2. It is possible to have a watch, warning or advisory out at the same time with the
   same number. The key in determining the difference is the header. See the headers in
   A10.2.1, A10.3.1, A10.3.2, and A10.4.1 for examples.
   A10.1.3. It is possible to have more than one watch, warning and advisory out at one time.
   It is important that our customers read each product carefully.

                   KEESLER AFB SPECIAL OBSERVATION CRITERIA

 A11.1. Special Observations. The Weather Forecaster takes a special observation (SPECI) to
 report weather conditions passing through critical threshold values important to flying
 operations. Weather Operations/EU disseminates these observations via the ADS. With the
 exception of single element specials, these observations contain the following information:
 date/time, sky condition, prevailing visibility, present weather and obstruction to visibility (if
 required), temperature, dew point, wind speed and direction (magnetic), altimeter setting,
 remarks (as appropriate), and RVR.
 A11.2. Criteria for Special Observations.
    A11.2.1. Ceilings. A ceiling forms or dissipates below, decreases to less than or, if below,
    increases to equal or exceeds:
