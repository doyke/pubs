SUMMARY OF CHANGES
A margin bar indicates newly revised material.


1. General: Incentive flights are designed to provide a visible reward to 349 AMW military personnel
for outstanding service and to motivate others to similar levels. The 349 AMW WG/CC or equivalent
level may authorize USAF active-duty and ARC military members to participate in local incentive flights.
   1.1. Eligibility: Each Group Commander will be allowed to select two individuals per flight. The
   four wing quarterly award winners from the previous quarter will also be provided a seat on the flight.
   The 349 AMW Vice Commander will select and approve the nomination (1 per quarter) from the wing
   staff agencies. The total number of seats allocated will not exceed 13 (two from each group, the four
   wing quarterly award winners, and one from the wing staff). Participation on incentive flights will be
2                                                                       349AMWI11-401 25 JUNE 2008


    on a one-time basis. Aircrew members in suspended or Duty Not Involving/Including Flying (DNIF)
    status are not authorized incentive flights without an approved waiver from AF/A3O-AT.
    1.2. Schedule: One incentive flight will be planned per quarter. Each squadron in the 349th Opera-
    tions Group (OG) will support one incentive flight per year. The incentive flight will be scheduled on
    the flying squadron’s respective Unit Training Assembly (UTA) weekend of the third month of each
    quarter. See Table 1. All flights will be performed within the local flying area and terminate at the
    point of origin without stopping at another location. Flights will be on a non-interference basis with
    unit training.

2. Responsibilities.
    2.1. Group/Unit:
       2.1.1. The Unit Commanders will submit nominations no later than (NLT) the last day of the first
       month of the new quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul, and Oct). The memorandum for record should consist of
       a brief narrative outlining the performance and contributions which warrant the nomination. It will
       also include the participant’s name and duty description. See Attachment 1.
       2.1.2. The Group Commanders will evaluate the nominations and select the most deserving mem-
       bers. Each Group Commander will be allowed to select two individuals per quarter. Attachment
       2 is a sample letter for each Group Commander to use when forwarding the request. The letter to
       the Vice Wing Commander is due NLT the second Friday of the second month of the quarter (Feb,
       May, Aug, and Nov).
       2.1.3. Once the Vice Wing Commander approves the nominees, the Group Commanders will
       notify the Squadron Commanders, who in turn will notify the individuals. The unit forwarding the
       request will coordinate with the Project Officer to determine the mission details and reporting
       instructions and will pass this information to its incentive flight participants. The flights will ten-
       tatively be scheduled for the flying squadron’s respective UTA weekend of the third month of the
       quarter. (Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec). See Table 2.

      2.1.4. Due to limited seating availability, the individuals need to be available for the flight for
      which they are selected. If the incentive flight participant is not available to attend, that person
      generally will not be rescheduled for future quarterly incentive flights. The unit commander will
      have the option to resubmit the individual for future consideration on an incentive flight.
      2.1.5. The unit will ensure ARC members are on an official duty status. Any other funding that
      may arise specific to the individual will be handled at the unit level.
   2.2. Incentive Flight Participant:
      2.2.1. Incentive flight participants will not be alerted for these flights. They will be given a time
      to show at the flying squadron by their respective units. This time will be conveyed to the Squad-
      ron Commanders at the weekly Wing Staff meeting and will normally be 2.5 hours prior to sched-
      uled takeoff. Any questions may be directed to the Project Officer. The incentive flight
      participants will report to the tasked flying squadron on the day of the flight. See Table 3.

      2.2.2. Although the flying squadrons will make every effort to meet the previously briefed show
      time, mission changes may occur. If the incentive flight participants show for the flight and it has
      been cancelled for weather, maintenance, etc., the individuals should report to their normal work
      place for the remainder of their duty shift. The squadron will determine if the local can be resched-
      uled and will notify the individuals of the new date.
      2.2.3. On the day of the flight, upon arriving at the squadron, incentive flight participants will be
      given a briefing about the flight. They will also be given the opportunity to buy a box lunch. The
      Project Officer will order and confirm the box lunches and ensure that they are delivered to the air-
      craft--exact change is preferred.

       2.2.4. Uniforms will be the uniform of the day (Battle Dress Uniforms or Airman Battle Uniforms
       are preferable) or applicable civilian attire. Non-aircrew participants will not normally wear flight
       suits.
    2.3. Wing Staff:
       2.3.1. The participant-approval letters will be routed to the Vice Wing Commander for approval.
       The letters will also require the coordination of the Wing Commander. After the approval letters
       are signed, they will be routed to the Operations Group for coordination. The Operations Group
       should make a copy of the approval letters and will forward the originals back to the Group Com-
       manders, who in turn will notify the Squadron Commanders.
       2.3.2. If an approval letter is signed for an individual from the Wing Staff, a copy of the letter
       should also be sent to the Operations Group.
    2.4. Operations Group:
       2.4.1. The Operations Group will generate a staff summary sheet in January of every year to get
       approval for the flights from AFRC/DOOM. The final approval for the staff summary sheet to
       include a mission identifier number authorizing the flights will be sent to 349th OSF/OSA for
       scheduling.
       2.4.2. At the beginning of every quarter, the OG/CC will appoint a Project Officer for the flight.
       The Project Officer should be a flyer from the weapon system accomplishing the incentive flight.
       The Project Officer and an email address or phone number will be briefed at the 349th Wing Staff
       meeting.
       2.4.3. After approval from the wing, the approval letters will be routed to the Operations Group.
       The Operations Group should make a copy of the approval letters and will forward the originals
       back to the Group Commanders and to the Project Officer. If an approval letter is signed for an
       individual from the Wing Staff, a copy of the letter should be sent to the Operations Group.
    2.5. 349 OSF/OSA--Current Operations:
       2.5.1. Current Operations will ensure that all flights will be performed within the local flying area
       and terminate at the point of origin without stopping at another location. Flights will be scheduled
       on a non-interference basis with unit training.
       2.5.2. Current Operations will confirm the date of the flight with the tasked flying squadron. They
       will also contact the Project Officer to confirm the number of incentive flight participants. At least
       two weeks prior to the date of the flight, they will brief this information at the weekly Wing Staff
       meeting.
       2.5.3. Current Operations will also be responsible for coordinating with the Aerial Port Squadron
       for air stairs for the departure and arrival of the incentive flights as appropriate. If the incentive
       flight takes place on a KC-10, Current Operations will confirm the total number of personnel on
       board, to include aircrew, for a final determination on the aircraft configuration. Every effort
       should be made to keep the total number of personnel (normally 13) low enough to utilize a
       “Bravo Configuration” for the KC-10. Every effort should be made to not change the flight from
       its original schedule once the times have been released to the wing. However, aircrew training will
       be the first priority.
       2.5.4. Current Operations will ensure the appropriate mission identifier is received.
349AMWI11-401 25 JUNE 2008                                                                                 5


   2.6. Project Officer:
      2.6.1. The OG/CC will appoint a Project Officer in the first month of each quarter. The Project
      Officer should be a flyer from the weapon system accomplishing the incentive flight. He/she will
      collect the names from the Operations Group and will be a point of contact for the units that have
      incentive flight participants. The Project Officer will keep the units informed of reporting proce-
      dures and any mission changes.
      2.6.2. The Project Officer will verify the final list of names from the approval letter and provide
      this list to the flying squadron (for the manifest) and the 349th OSF/OSA (fax 4-0656) no later than
      0900L the day prior to the flight.
      2.6.3. The Project Officer will ensure the incentive flight participants are manifested prior to the
      flight. The manifest will be accomplished on a DD Form 2131, History Operations After-Action
      Report, and finalized the morning of the flight.
      2.6.4. The day of the flight, the Project Officer will provide a briefing to the incentive flight par-
      ticipants detailing the flight and the job of the crewmembers involved. The Project Officer will
      also arrange an aircraft safety briefing and an anti-hijack briefing In Accordance With (IAW) AFI
      31-101V1, Aircrew Life Support (ALS) Program, to be given at the squadron. A headcount will be
      attained at this time to finalize the manifest. Participants will also have the opportunity to buy a
      box lunch. The Project Officer will order and confirm the box lunches and ensure that they are
      delivered to the aircraft.
      2.6.5. The Project Officer will escort the incentive flight participants to and from the aircraft.
      Prior to flight, the Project Officer will deliver a copy of the manifest to the 349th Wing Operations
      Center (WOC), Base Operations, and the aircraft commander.
   2.7. Flying squadron:
      2.7.1. Commanders will ensure that all the provisions of AFI 11-401 and the Wing Operations
      Plan are adhered to. No simulated emergencies or touch-and-gos will be flown with passengers on
      board.
      2.7.2. The Scheduler/Mission Controller will notify the Project Officer of any mission changes. If
      the local is cancelled the squadron will determine if it can be rescheduled. The Project Officer will
      notify the individuals of the new date.
      2.7.3. The aircraft commander will correctly annotate the location of the passenger manifest
      (WOC) on the flight plan DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan.
      2.7.4. If the aircraft has an unscheduled divert, the Scheduler/Mission Controller will notify the
      WOC (4-5678). Additionally, the aircraft commander will notify the WOC upon landing.
