      needs.
   1.7.2. Unit Responsibilities. Unit commanders or CDMOs (for UH) ensure inventories of room fur-
   nishings by dormitory residents at change of occupancy. The new occupant signs an AF Form 228,
   acknowledging quantity and condition of furnishings and equipment present in his or her room. The
   unit then ensures updated information is placed in the unit's master AF Form 228 file. A unit’s master
   AF Form 228 file is one that compiles all the individual room data. The Housing Flight Chief accom-
   plishes these requirements for unaccompanied officer quarters (UOQ) and unaccompanied noncomis-
   sioned officer quarters (UNCOQ). (Lodging managers do not have to inventory room furnishings
   between changes in temporary duty [TDY] or transient customers, since these individuals do not sign
   an AF Form 228.)

                                                Chapter 2

                                 FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Furnishings and Appliances Budgets. The BCE, through the housing flight and operations flight,
consolidates requirements for the procurement, management, maintenance and repair (M&R) of all gov-
ernment-owned APF furnishings and domestic appliances for UH and FH. FMO, through the housing
flight chief and lodging management, obtains budget input or estimates, by program element, and pro-
vides them to the BCE resource advisor (RA) who, based on the program element, forwards to the appli-
cable resource advisor/comptroller who advocates for the listed program element. For example, fire
department furnishings requirements are advocated in Facilities Operation (FO) PE (PE XXX79F). Dor-
mitories furnishing requirements are advocated in the permanent party UH, PE (PE XX679F). These esti-
mates include requirements for furnishings initial issue, upgrade, M&R and replacement programs for
UH and FH. Lodging programs, through the services commander, for items to be procured with NAF
funds and advocates through the installation comptroller for APF lodging requirements (PE XXX96F).
(See AFI 34-209, Nonappropriated Fund Financial Management and Accounting, and AFI 34-214, Pro-
cedures for Nonappropriated Fund Financial Management and Accounting). AFI 65-106, Appropriated
Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities, specifies
when APF funds may be used for lodging furnishings and appliances.
   2.1.1. When estimating furniture requirements:
       2.1.1.1. Derive the basic furnishings requirements from furnishings allowance (see Chapter 8)
       for unaccompanied and family housing and AFI 34-246, Air Force Lodging Program, for lodging.
       2.1.1.2. Use the installation QIP to further define the type and style of furnishings.
       2.1.1.3. Include furnishings administrative support requirements in budget estimates.
   2.1.2. Use O&M funds (PE XX679) to provide furnishings for government-owned UH and for unac-
   companied personnel residing in overseas rental housing. Operating cost, to include UH furnishings
   and appliances for permanent party UH, is funded from UH PEXX679F.
   2.1.3. Use family housing funds to provide furnishings for family housing and accompanied person-
   nel authorized to live in rented quarters overseas.
   2.1.4. Use APF and NAF for furnishings requirements related to facility construction, maintenance,
   and repair projects in accordance with AFI 65-106, Figure 6.1.

2.2. Budget Requirements Justifications . Furnishings budget justifications include complete informa-
tion and thoroughly supported data. Note:
   2.2.1. Age and condition of inventory and equipment.
   2.2.2. Furnishings requirements for scheduled military construction program renovation, new con-
   struction, and acquisition housing projects.
   2.2.3. Any mission changes.
   2.2.4. Loaner kit requirements (full Joint Federal Travel Regulation [JFTR] locations) and furniture
   (limited JFTR locations) for overseas housing. Unaccompanied personnel are authorized loaner kits,
   which are purchased with base O&M funds.
10                                                                         AFI32-6004 3 MARCH 2006


2.3. Budgeting for Appliances . The BCE, through the housing flight, budgets for the maintenance and
repair (M&R) of all government-owned appliances for dormitories, lodging, and family housing. M&R
includes replacement and backup stock.
     2.3.1. For FH authorized free-standing appliances, all costs associated with initial issue, replacement
     and maintenance & repair of are funded with P-721.4.
     2.3.2. For FH authorized built-in appliances, replacement and maintenance & repair are funded with
     P-722.62. Refer to Attachment 8 for authorized appliances.
     2.3.3. For UH authorized appliances, the funding source is the permanent party UH PE (PEXX679F).
     See Attachment 6 for authorized appliances.
     2.3.4. For authorized lodging appliances (VQs and TLFs), the Lodging Manager provides require-
     ments to the FMO. The Services Commander advocates for BOS PEXXX96F funding through the
     Installation Comptroller. See Attachment 6 for authorized appliances.

2.4. Furnishings Backup Stock . Backup stock provides items to replace broken or worn-out furnish-
ings. Compute the installation backup stock quantity or level by considering:
     2.4.1. Past usage. (As an example, if only three particular items were exchanged in the past year, then
     only three of that item should be required for backup.)
     2.4.2. Projected customer needs.
     2.4.3. Transportation or resupply lead times.
     2.4.4. Available storage space.
     2.4.5. Furnishings repair time.

2.5. Furnishings Repair. Evaluate APF furnishings and appliance requirements for contract and
in-house repair, including furnishings associated with facility repair and construction projects. The BCE
should estimate funds requirements for contract and in-house repair of UH and FH furnishings from bud-
getary data provided by UH management and family housing. Determine required items, quantities and
repair costs, and provide to the civil engineering RA for inclusion in the applicable O&M and MFH finan-
cial plans. Consolidate lodging furnishings and appliances repair requirements in the CE furnishings
repair contract under a separate line item and fund in accordance with AFI 65-106. The Services Com-
mander will advocate for VQ and TLF furnishings repair funding through their installation comptroller.
Incorporate lodging furnishings and appliance repairs as a separate line item in the CE repair program, but
fund in accordance with AFI 65-106. Identify and budget Services requirements and estimates through
the Services Commander/Director. Describe each item needed and justify estimates for quantities and
repair costs.

2.6. Transportation of Furnishings . Estimate the:
     2.6.1. Number of units to be supported.
     2.6.2. Number of trips.
     2.6.3. Approximate weight per trip.
     2.6.4. Costs for pickup and delivery services for contracted furnishings moves.
AFI32-6004 3 MARCH 2006                                                                                11


   2.6.5. Mileage for fuel costs and associated equipment and supplies for in-house furnishings moves.

2.7. Acquisition . Furnishings and appliance acquisition is complicated and requires close coordination
and aggressive follow-up on orders (See Table 2.1.). Special attention to details is necessary so that the
correct items arrive on time.
   2.7.1. Appliances. Use locally established procurement procedures.
       2.7.1.1. Family Housing. To determine the proper cost category for FH appliances, use the prin-
       ciple that freestanding is an operations cost (P-721) and installed is an M&R cost (P-722). Pur-
       chase FH freestanding (not built in) appliances, such as stoves, refrigerators, stoves, with 721.4
       funds. Account for FH built-in appliances, such as dishwashers, built-in ovens and cooktops, in
       P-722.
       2.7.1.2. Unaccompanied Housing (UH). Purchase UH appliances with O&M funds in PEXX679.
       2.7.1.3. Visiting Quarters (VQ) and Temporary Lodging Facilities (TLF). Purchase and repair
       appliances for existing VQ and TLF with O&M funds and account for in BOS PEXXX96F. Pur-
       chase appliances for new construction of a VQ with O&M funds in BOS PEXXX96F, and pur-
       chase appliances for new construction of a TLF with NAF.
       2.7.1.4. For new UH and VQ construction or major renovations, the housing and lodging manag-
       ers, respectively, coordinate with FMO to ensure compatibility of appliances with utility connec-
       tions (gas, water, sewer and electric) and space constraints.
   2.7.2. FMO Responsibilities:
       2.7.2.1. Orders furnishings and appliances by completing the required documentation.
       2.7.2.2. Ensures funds are obligated by monitoring funds availability documents until the order is
       delivered.
       2.7.2.3. Coordinates requirements for funding (CE funds manager) and purchasing (supply/con-
       tracting) with appropriate office.
       2.7.2.4. Ensures the installation QIC approves all UH furnishings/appliances purchases included
       in the QIP.
       2.7.2.5. Follows up on all outstanding furnishings/appliances orders until the items arrive.
   2.7.3. Ordering. Use AF Form 2005, Issue/Turn-In Request, DD Form 1348-6, DoD Private Line
   Item Requisition System Document, AF Form 9, Request for Purchase, and IMPAC card to order
   furnishings and obtain services.
   2.7.4. Special Procedures. Use contracting or General Services Administration (GSA) special project
   furnishings procedures to minimize storage and handling, to ensure that items arrive by the estimated
   delivery date (EDD), and to obtain the best possible price. Special project procedures accommodate
   installation needs for:
       2.7.4.1. Facility beneficial occupancy date.
       2.7.4.2. Incremental shipments.
       2.7.4.3. Quantity discounts.
       2.7.4.4. Containerized shipments at manufacturer plants.
12                                                                         AFI32-6004 3 MARCH 2006


Table 2.1. Deleted.


2.8. Supplies. Do not include funds for expendable supplies and grounds maintenance equipment items
for UH and lodging day-to-day operations (non-furnishings allowance) in the FMO budget. For perma-
nent party UH, the using unit [squadron under unit dormitory management concept or Consolidated Dor-
mitory Management Operations (CDMO)] budgets for and purchases these items using PE XX679F. For
pipeline (student) dormitories, DO budgets for and purchases supplies.

2.9. Contingency Lodging. Services (SV), as the manager of contingency lodging facilities, identifies
furnishings requirements to the base civil engineer (CE). CE should provide minimal furnishings to meet
contingency requirements, such as excess FMO furniture from either the support base or within the
region. If surplus stocks are not available, FMO should purchase required furnishings from appropriated
funds as necessary, using funds earmarked for specific contingency operations when appropriate. SV pro-
vides accountability for furnishings assets while they are in use in contingency lodging facilities, and CE
provides FMO purchasing, delivery, warehousing, and if required, pickup for final disposition when fur-
nishings are no longer required.

2.10. Appliance Backup Stock . The backup stock provides replacement appliances, as required, using
the same criteria as furnishings backup stock. Only minimum back-up stock will be maintained. Consider
the availability of local purchase sources when computing the installation backup stock quantity or level
based on:
     2.10.1. Past usage. (Example: If only three particular items were exchanged in the past year, then only
     three of that item should be required for backup.)
     2.10.2. Projected customer needs.
     2.10.3. Transportation or resupply lead times.
     2.10.4. Available storage space.
     2.10.5. Appliance repair time.

       house.
       3.2.1.2. Block refrigerator doors open.
       3.2.1.3. Use material handling equipment to load and unload crated, boxed, or palletized items
       and to move assets within the warehouse. Pad hand trucks and dollies to avoid damaging items.
       Place pads between wood and item surfaces.
       3.2.1.4. Cover items that are not in boxes or containers.
       3.2.1.5. Mark aisles with safety stripes, and post exit markings, load bearing limits, and other
       safety information.
   3.2.2. Stacking Requirements. When stacking items, do not exceed the load capacity of the bottom
   item. Mattresses and box springs are a special concern. Stack these in a manner that prevent safety
   hazards or damage to the assets. Observe the manufacturer’s recommended stacking limitations.
   3.2.3. Other Requirements:
       3.2.3.1. Obtain entomology services to exterminate insects in storage areas.
14                                                                            AFI32-6004 3 MARCH 2006


        3.2.3.2. Request the technical assistance of the installation safety office in all matters relating to
        accident prevention. Make sure that workers wear protective clothing, such as gloves and safety
        shoes.
        3.2.3.3. Use signs or aisle markers to identify the warehouse locations of serviceable items.

3.3. Pickup and Delivery Service . Coordinate pickup and delivery service with customers. Customers
may provide transportation, if desired. A furnishings representative or quality assurance evaluator (QAE)
in contract operations (surveillance method to measure contractor performance will be left to each base):
     3.3.1. Accompanies commercial contractors for pickup and delivery service.
     3.3.2. Checks issues and turn-ins for proper identification, quantity, condition, and cleanliness.

3.4. Receiving Furnishings . Base supply, transportation, and FMO must coordinate on the receipt of
APF-purchased furnishings shipments. Lodging must coordinate on the receipt of items purchased with
NAF funds. On incoming shipments:
     3.4.1. Verify the identification, quantity, and condition of furnishings. Immediately report any new
     furnishings that are damaged or of poor quality to base supply or base contracting. These agencies

     3.4.2. Maintain records on the date of delivery for furnishings items.
     3.4.3. Use the date of receipt to determine depreciation allowances on statements of charges, cash col-
     lection vouchers, deficiency reports, and reports of survey. Use the date of receipt to determine the age
     of the inventory for future furnishings replacement.
     3.4.4. Maintain appliance warranty data by inserting information onto AF Form 4302, Appliance
     Warranty, listing make/model, warranty expiration date, serial number, and date of purchase. Affix it
     to the back of each appliance. The purpose is to have a record that determines if the appliance can be
     repaired under warranty provisions by the manufacturer. Use the date of receipt to determine depreci-
     ation allowances on statements of charges, cash collection vouchers, deficiency reports, and reports of
     survey.

3.5. Storage, Operation, and Movement of Property . Follow established safety practices. Request the
technical assistance of the installation safety office in all matters relating to accident prevention. Make
sure that workers wear protective clothing such as gloves and safety shoes.

3.6. Moving . Industry standards will be used for this process. Use materials-handling equipment to load
and unload crated, boxed, or palletized items, and to move assets within the warehouse. Pad hand trucks
and dollies to avoid damaging items. Furniture pads or paper wrapping materials will be used to protect
individual items of furnishings when being transported, unless they are already in corrugated or plastic
shipping containers.

3.7. Inspection and Tagging . Furnishings personnel (assisted by lodging personnel for lodging APF
and NAF property) will:
   3.7.1. Identify property and mark/label it in places not easily visible by the user.
   3.7.2. Check property condition.
   3.7.3. Determine property's final disposition.
   3.7.4. Sign appropriate documentation for turn-ins.
   3.7.5. Segregate and mark all repairable and condemned property in storage.

3.8. Repair and Replacement. Charge appliance and furnishings maintenance, repair or replacement as
directed in AFI 65-106.
   3.8.1. Furniture will not be replaced unless the estimated cost of repair or rehabilitation, including any
   transportation expense, exceeds at least 75 percent of the cost of a new item of the same type and
   class. An exception is authorized in those unusual situations when rehabilitation of the furniture at 75
   percent of the cost of a new item would not extend its useful life for a period compatible with the cost
   of rehabilitation (Attachment 5). NOTE: Prescribed repair allowances are in addition to any effective
   manufacturer’s warranty. Warranty service will be used to the fullest extent.
   3.8.2. Establish a repair and preventive maintenance program for items purchased with appropriated
   funds. This program includes minor touch-up of surfaces, tightening and adjusting hardware, and
   minor re-gluing.
   3.8.3. Limit furnishings repair to items authorized by the furnishings allowance. Use O&M funds to
   repair furnishings procured with O&M funds.
   3.8.4. Use contract repair services when furniture repair requirements exceed installation FMO pre-
   ventive maintenance capabilities. Consider contractor pickup and delivery of items.
   3.8.5. Customers who have furnishings items for repair may take the items in themselves or request
   FMO transportation assistance. The FMO inspects the item to determine whether it needs replacement
   because of fair wear and tear or negligence, and informs the customer.
   3.8.6. When available, immediately issue replacement appliances to the customer. When replace-
   ment items are not available, adjust the records and requisition the needed items. Process damaged
   items for repair or turn-in to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO). The lodging
   manager decides when to process lodging property into the installation recycling center in lieu of
   transfer to DRMO.

     3.8.7. Accomplish a written cost benefit analysis for appliances. This analysis should include items
     such as date purchased, date installed, previous repairs performed, and cost incurred. If the one-time
     cost for repair of the appliance is greater than 55 percent of replacement value, the appliance should
     be replaced.
     3.8.8. The repair authority or QAE must maintain the appliance cost benefit analysis documentation
     for one year, or as directed by local record management personnel.
     3.8.9. Limit appliance repair to only items authorized by allowance standards in Attachment 6. Use
     FH funds to repair appliances for family housing. Use NAF for repair of items purchased with NAF
     (AFI 65-106).
     3.8.10. Use contracted repair services when appliance repair requirements exceed installation preven-
     tive maintenance (PM) capabilities. Immediately issue a replacement appliance when required and
     available. Process the damaged item for repair or turn it in to the DRMO. When replacement items
     aren't available, requisition or purchase the needed items in accordance with local procedures.
     3.8.11. Appliances in FH in CONUS are Real Property Installed Equipment (RPIE) and normally
     consist of stoves, refrigerators, installed microwave ovens and dishwashers.
     3.8.12. Furnishings Management Office (FMO) will establish procedures to register appliances and
     receive manufacturer recall information for potential fire and safety hazards by the end of the first
     quarter in Fiscal Year 2004. FMO will check the Consumer Product Safety Commission
     (http://www.cpsc.gov) and the Government-Industry Data Exchange Program
     (http://www.gidep.org) for current recall information on a quarterly basis, as a minimum.

                                         ACCOUNTABILITY

4.1. Philosophy . The Air Force has a large investment in quality quarters furnishings and issues these
assets to numerous units. Accountability for quarters furnishings on an installation is therefore extremely
important, and is not the sole responsibility of the FMO. Unit commanders, dormitory managers, lodging
managers, housing flight chiefs, and all personnel who use and benefit from quarters furnishings must
take an active and responsible part in the accountability process. Lodging managers account for NAF
items.

4.2. Types of Furnishings Accountability . There are three supply accountability codes that pertain to
furnishings. These are:
   4.2.1. XB3 – Expendable items (low cost items for which no base level repairs are performed i.e. bed-
   spreads, trash cans, smoke detectors, small fire extinguishers, small portable transformers, etc.).
   4.2.2. NF1 – Non-equipment authorization inventory data accountable (EAID) items (for example:
   desks, wardrobes, chairs, beds, etc.).
   4.2.3. NF3 – EAID accountable items with a line item value of $2,500.00 or greater (for example:
   large screen television, etc).

4.3. Transaction Records . Maintain a clear and defined audit trail of all furnishings transactions.
   4.3.1. Establish accounts for NF3 items with base supply in accordance with AFI 23-101.
   4.3.2. Use automated systems for accountability when available.
   4.3.3. Document all furnishings transactions on internal furnishings accounting control records.
   These records show the status of all furnishings and appliances physically in the warehouses and those
   issued to customers and in in-house or contract maintenance.
   4.3.4. Use AF Form 228, Furnishings Custody Receipt and Condition Report to issue furnishings
   to authorized customers, and make sure that all records are properly adjusted (custodian authorization/
   custody receipt listing [CA/CRL], automated, and manual system). FMO keeps a jacket file on all cus-
   tomers, with pertinent documents (such as AF Forms 228, orders, and appointment letters).
   4.3.5. Use AF Form 227, Quarters Condition Inspection Report, for FH, and AF Form 228 for
   other users, to issue appliances to authorized customers. Use AF Form 228 to account for appliances
   maintained in the warehouse (includes serviceable, repairable, and condemned). The housing flight or
   FMO maintains a jacket file on all customers, with pertinent documents (such as AF Forms 227 or AF
   Forms 228, orders, and appointment letters). Installations will develop local procedures to account for
   appliances returned to storage for the convenience of the customer. Ensure the make, model, and serial
   numbers of appliances turned in to DRMO are recorded and items are removed from the inventory
   records. Documents showing transfer to DRMO should be maintained for a minimum of one year.

4.4. Customer Accounts . Customers (unit commanders or designated representatives, dormitory man-
agers, lodging managers, housing flight chief, and housing residents, where appropriate) establish an
account with FMO. FMO maintains a master AF Form 228, which reflects all furnishings issued to each
customer. Customers sign AF Form 228 at FMO for total items used by their unit or quarters. Units and
18                                                                            AFI32-6004 3 MARCH 2006


CDMO establish internal control measures to make sure individuals sign AF Form 228 for room furnish-
ings (does not apply to lodging). They also appoint representatives from their units to act as points of con-
tact with FMO.
     4.4.1. Furnishings in jointly occupied UH using the unit dormitory management concept must be
     accounted for by the unit that manages the facility which is normally the largest assigned unit. Where
     CDMO is used, that office will sign for furnishings. Individual occupants, other than lodging guests,
     sign the AF Form 228 acknowledging the quantity and condition of furnishings.
     4.4.2. Turn-ins. Individual room occupants turn in items as required to designated representatives.
     FMO accepts turn-ins from the custodian only. Do not use unit UH sleeping rooms and storage rooms
     to store quarters furnishings.

4.5. Excess Furnishings . See paragraph 8.4.9. FMO will document any transfers on DD Form 1149,
Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document, or DD Form 1348-1, Issue Release/Receipt Document.
Bases may report excess furnishings to MAJCOM via electronic means or by memorandum. MAJCOM
may facilitate transfers of property between bases to meet furnishings needs. The transportation costs
related to the transfer of excess property is the responsibility of the gaining installation.

4.6. Inventory/Assessment . An inventory and assessment of the condition of all furnishings and appli-
ances other than in FH is required at least annually. Inventory and assessments are accomplished by the
responsible customer and findings forwarded to the FMO. FH inventories and condition assessments are
accomplished upon change of occupancy. The FMO inventories and assesses warehouse assets and appli-
ances in repair. Results of all inventory and assessment finding must be forwarded from FMO to the hous-
ing flight chief.
     4.6.1. FMO will perform a physical count of warehouse assets and items in repair. Sensitive or pilfer-
     able items (televisions, VCRs, microwave ovens) will be inventoried semiannually. Records on items
     in maintenance (contract or in-house) or pending transfer to DRMO will be reconciled at the time of
     the inventory of serviceable assets.
     4.6.2. FMO will conduct a review of at least 10 percent of jacket files for all GOQ and FH accounts
     annually. This reconciliation will consist of comparing the AF Form 228 of assets issued against man-
     ual or computer records of the transaction. A record of the reconciliation will be kept in the jacket file.
     4.6.3. Customers (unit commanders, dormitory managers, lodging managers, and housing flight
     chief, for UOQ/UNCOQ facilities) annually (each base should establish a specific month) inventory
     and assess the condition of appropriated fund furnishings in their respective facilities to ensure they
     match the quantity originally received from FMO. The customer will conduct a physical inventory of
     furnishings. The assessment consists of a visual inspection of the issued assets made at the time of
     inventory. Findings of the inventory and assessment will be reported to FMO.
        4.6.3.1. Document the assessment on a unit master AF Form 228, sending one copy to the FMO
        and keeping one at the unit or in lodging.
        4.6.3.2. Units report APF furnishings and appliances identified as damaged, lost, or destroyed
        through suspected occupant abuse or neglect to the FMO.
AFI32-6004 3 MARCH 2006                                                                               19


4.7. Account Adjustment. Correct discrepancies to customer accounts as they are discovered and adjust
the master AF Form 228 for that unit as required until the next annual assessment. The FMO will ensure
the appropriate action is taken.

4.8. Review. The housing flight chief annually reviews assessments and supporting documentation and
certifies this review in writing. The services military support flight chief accomplishes these tasks for
lodging and sends a results/findings to the housing flight chief certifying accomplishment.

                                                  Chapter 5

                                        OVERSEAS OPERATIONS

5.1. Requirements . Overseas furnishings operations differ from continental United States (CONUS)
operations in that greater inventories, staff, and resources to support on-base and off-base customers in
full and limited JFTR conditions are needed.
     5.1.1. Installation Furnishings and Appliances. The installation furnishings program is an important
     part of the sponsorship program. Advertise and promote the local furnishings program in base spon-
     sorship and welcome package information; people use this information to make decisions about per-
     sonal household goods shipments before they depart for an overseas area.
     5.1.2. Definition. The Air Force authorizes overseas furnishings and appliances support to:
        5.1.2.1. Personnel assigned to government-controlled housing.
        5.1.2.2. Personnel who qualify for government housing but elect to live off base and receive a
        housing allowance (basic allowance for quarters [BAQ] or living quarters allowance [LQA]).
        Government civilian employees must be entitled to LQA to receive government provided furnish-
        ings/appliance support. Civilians in Alaska and Hawaii are also authorized use of loaner kits (in
        accordance with paragraph 8.6.1.) regardless of LQA entitlement when relocating from outside
        the local area.
        5.1.2.3. Foreign military members or personnel authorized assistance by host tenant support.
     5.1.3. Contractor and technical representative personnel are not authorized FMO support.

5.2. Customer Support . Designate a customer service function within each FMO. This function pro-
vides authorized personnel with furnishings entitlements and support.
     5.2.1. Provide a local procedure information brochure to customers.
     5.2.2. Schedule pickup and delivery service. Customers who miss appointments for pickup and or
     delivery without prior approval will be rescheduled at the convenience of the FMO. Include this pol-
     icy in the FMO brochure.
     5.2.3. Follow procedures for customer property receipt. An authorized member or spouse will sign
     the AF Form 228 to receive furnishings. A member may, in extraordinary circumstances, give power
     of attorney to another person to perform all furnishings transactions (for example, if a member must
     depart early from the overseas area).
     5.2.4. Coordinate appliance connection and disconnection service (hookup of stoves, dryers) with
     civil engineering if required.
     5.2.5. Make sure that employees who have contact with customers adequately speak and write
     English.
     5.2.6. Issue replacements only when a furnishings inspector deems it necessary. Do not exchange
     items to satisfy a member's personal preference at government expense.
     5.2.7. Keep a back-order list for items that are not available. Keep this list by item and date of request,
     so that the oldest back-order request may be satisfied first when items come in. Give initial-issue
AFI32-6004 3 MARCH 2006                                                                                21


   shortages priority over replacement shortages. Remove customers who no longer require requested
   items from the back-order list or who refuse to accept a serviceable, used item.
   5.2.8. To minimize transportation expenses and unnecessary wear on furnishings, leave assets in
   quarters and make account transfers between authorized customers when possible. Account for fur-
   nishings at all times. The new and former customers jointly inventory assets, and the new customer
   signs the AF Form 228 after any discrepancies are corrected.
   5.2.9. Customers should make every attempt to identify their furnishings requirements to FMO as
   soon as possible after arriving (ideally within 60 days). Limit subsequent requests for additional fur-
   nishings to extenuating circumstances, such as changed quarters or an increase in family size.
   5.2.10. Do not transport government-issued items solely for a customer's personal convenience. Pro-
   vide transportation only for government-directed moves or for extenuating circumstances such as
   medical condemnation of quarters for health or sanitation problems.
   5.2.11. FMO and the transportation management office (TMO) work together to coordinate delivery
   and pickup of government and personal household goods. Maintain a back-order list for appliances
   that are not available. To minimize transportation expenses and unnecessary wear on appliances, leave
   assets in quarters and make account transfers between authorized customers when possible. Account
   for appliances at all times. The new and former customers jointly inventory assets, and the new cus-
   tomer signs the AF Form 228 after discrepancies are corrected. Customers should make every attempt
   to identify their appliances requirements to FMO as soon as possible after arrival (ideally within 60
   days).

5.3. Furnishings Support . Set up basic furnishings support programs overseas to minimize government
temporary lodging allowance (TLA) expenses and to alleviate personal inconvenience or hardships to
customers. These hardships normally result from overseas construction practices and electrical services
that cause members to purchase items they do not need in CONUS housing.
   5.3.1. Give customers basic support items (excludes loaner kits) for the duration of the tour, regard-
   less of their JFTR entitlement. Basic support items may include (but are not limited to) appliances,
   wardrobes, electrical transformers, and kitchen cabinets. Appliances are normally provided due to
   weight limitations and the utility differences from those used in CONUS. The list of appliances autho-
   rized includes ranges, microwave ovens, refrigerators, clothes washers and dryers, and portable dish-
   washers. The size of the refrigerator issued will be determined by facility constraints and or family
   size as determined by the local BCE. Items normally are issued only when not provided by the land-
   lord.
   5.3.2. For full JFTR, limit furnishings support to items in the furnishings allowance preface. In gen-
   eral, do not allow customers to keep loaner kits for more than 90 days. Installation commanders may
   authorize exceptions when circumstances warrant (for example, when the customer experiences hard-
   ships, natural disasters, or other unforeseen difficulties). Document exceptions in the customer jacket
   file.
   5.3.3. For limited JFTR, limit furnishings support to items in the furnishings allowance preface. Issue
   furnishings for the duration of the tour. Authorize additional weight for customers to ship personal
   household goods when government items are not available.
   5.3.4. Include FMO on the military personnel flight (MPF) out-processing checklist.

5.4. Overseas Furnishings and Quarters Availability Report, RCS: HAF-ILE(SA) 7803 . Housing
flight chiefs at overseas locations must submit this report to their MAJCOM by 1 January and 1 July each
year. See Attachment 3 for specific reporting requirements. This report:
     5.4.1. Projects government quarters and furniture availability over a six-month period for unaccom-
     panied members.
     5.4.2. Identifies excess weight entitlements for both unaccompanied and accompanied members at
     restricted JFTR locations when government furniture is not available.
AFI32-6004 3 MARCH 2006                                                                               23


                                               Chapter 6

                                   APPLIANCE MANAGEMENT

6.1. Definition . Appliances are defined as domestic refrigerators, stoves, clothes dryers, clothes wash-
ers, freezers, portable dishwashers, microwave ovens, and ice machines. Government-owned appliances
provided in UH and lodging are non-EAID and the unit commander or designated representative, dormi-
tory manager, housing flight chief, or lodging manager accounts for them.

6.2. Appliance Authorizations . Assign appliance quantity allowances in accordance with the furnish-
ings allowance. The FMO provides initial issue and replacement, of appliances for UH and lodging (AFI
65-106, Chapter 6). Provide at least one washer per 12 individuals and one dryer for 8 individuals
assigned to UH and lodging; this ratio can be adjusted to accommodate installation needs (for example,
providing more dryers than washers). The standard for Temporary Lodging Facilities (TLF) is 1 Set
(washer & dryer) per each TLF unit (new construction).

6.3. Unaccompanied Housing (UH) and Lodging Appliances . The size and type of appliance needed
for UH and transient lodging will be the size and type of appliance "as required," depending on the room
and facility configuration (Chapter 8).
   6.3.1. Provide commercial-size washers and dryers in government-owned or -leased UH and in lodg-
   ing quarters at no cost to occupants. The appliance may be contractor-owned, -leased, or govern-
   ment-owned.
   6.3.2. Do not provide government purchased/owned ice machine, washers and dryers vice leased
   items unless such provision clearly serves the best interest of the government. In CONUS, obtain
   MAJCOM Civil Engineer approval prior to purchasing washers and dryers for use in UH and lodging.
   6.3.3. Conduct a comparative cost analysis before procuring government-owned equipment for either
   initial installation or replacement purposes.

6.4. Management. Management is defined as budgeting for new and replacement appliances and
accounting for items in use. The housing flight manages government-owned appliances in UH (perma-
nent and pipeline) and family housing. The lodging manager manages appliances in VQs and TLFs.

6.5. Appliance Maintenance:
   6.5.1. In CONUS, the operations flight is responsible for contract maintenance and repair (M&R) of
   appliances in FH, UH and lodging unless good business practices determine the responsibility should
   be elsewhere. The BCE competitively sources the appliance M&R program by separate contract,
   incorporating into an existing furnishings management contract, or as an addendum to the housing
   maintenance contract. When adding appliance M&R to the housing maintenance contract, provide
   separate contract line item numbers (CLIN) for O&M (PE XXX96F, PEXX679F), NAF, and FH
   (721.4). . Appliances in CONUS FH are RPIE. Refer to www.afcesa.af.mil for a statement of work
   (SOW) template and marketing analyses for outsourcing appliance management and M&R.
   6.5.2. The operations flight is responsible for providing a QAE and technical assistance. Overseas,
   the operations flight is responsible for the M&R and replacement of FH, UH and lodging appliances
   using the appropriate funds cite. When including M&R and replacement of UH and lodging in the
24                                                                      AFI32-6004 3 MARCH 2006


     housing maintenance contract, use separate funds cites for O&M (PE XXX96f, BOS (PE XXX679f),
     FH (PE 721.4), and NAF. Do not use housing funds for this purpose. When dormitory and lodging
     appliances are included in the housing maintenance contract, the housing flight is responsible for
     QAE duties, and develops local procedures to manage appliances in control of the contractor.

6.6. Compatibility . For new dormitory construction and or major renovation, the FMO coordinates with
the customer (unit that will occupy the facility) and CE to make sure that the requested appliances are
compatible with the utility connection (gas or electric) and space available in the quarters.
AFI32-6004 3 MARCH 2006                                                                               25


                                               Chapter 7

  QUARTERS IMPROVEMENT COMMITTEE (QIC)/QUARTERS IMPROVEMENT PLAN
                              (QIP)

7.1. Philosophy . The QIC is the key element at each base to ensure furnishings are replaced on a system-
atic basis and an ongoing plan to upgrade and maintain the facilities used as UH.

7.2. Quarters Improvement Committee (QIC) . The FMO is responsible for all actions associated with
assembling data for and managing the QIC meetings (paragraphs A3.4. and A3.6.) and maintaining and
updating the QIP. The FMO is responsible for acting as recorder and prepares and distributes minutes of
QIC meetings. Attachment 3 is a sample guide for establishing and conducting a QIC meeting.

7.3. Quarters Improvement Plan (QIP). The QIP implements the decision of the QIC. Attachment 4
is a sample guide for preparing and maintaining a QIP.

                                                 Chapter 8

                            FURNISHINGS ALLOWANCE STANDARDS

8.1. Philosophy. The Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS) has changed dramatically the
way furnishings allowances are maintained. Allowances for all quarters furnishings must be controlled.
Next to accountability, establishing a standard for maintaining furnishings allowances is imperative. That
is the purpose of this chapter.

8.2. Policy. DoD 4165.63-M states that government-owned furnishings will not be provided in CONUS
except for a few specific authorizations. The authorizations applicable to this instruction are not for the
quarters occupied by personnel assigned to SCPs as specified in DoD Directive 1100.12, Authority for
Establishing Special Command Positions, September 3, 1991, and AFI 32-6003, and quarters occupied by
foreign exchange officers.

8.3. Types of Allowances . With all furnishings allowance standards, there is general information appli-
cable to all, while there is specific guidance unique to each. General information is provided in paragraph
8.4. Guidance unique to a specific allowance standard is provided in subsequent paragraphs. The allow-
ance standards in this chapter supersede those under Allowance Standards 106 and 414, which are being
deleted from AFEMS. The categories of quarters furnishings allowance standards covering different types
of facilities or applications are:
     8.3.1. Unaccompanied housing (UH) allowance standards.
        8.3.1.1. Furnishings for enlisted dormitories.
        8.3.1.2. Furnishings for UNCOQ.
        8.3.1.3. Furnishings for UOQ.
     8.3.2. Overseas housing allowance standards.
        8.3.2.1. Furnishings for housekeeping quarters in overseas areas with JFTR weight limitations.
        8.3.2.2. Furnishings for loaner kits for housekeeping quarters in overseas areas with full JFTR
        weight allowances.
        8.3.2.3. Furnishings for housekeeping quarters in overseas areas for unaccompanied military and
        authorized civilian personnel required to reside off-base.
     8.3.3. Special allowance standards.
        8.3.3.1. Furnishings for ALS dormitories.
        8.3.3.2. Furnishings for intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launch control facility (LCF)
        sleeping and entertainment areas.
        8.3.3.3. Furnishings for quarters of allied exchange officers.
        8.3.3.4. Furnishings for fire department sleeping and entertainment areas.
        8.3.3.5. Furnishings for lodging facilities.
        8.3.3.6. General officer and installation commander quarters. NOTE: These allowances are con-
        tained in AFI 32-6003.
AFI32-6004 3 MARCH 2006                                                                                  27


       8.3.3.7. Furnishings for quarters of incumbents of SCPs.
   8.3.4. Changes to Allowance Standards. HQ USAF/ILE is the approval authority for changes to and
   deviations from allowance standards other than lodging. HQ USAF/ILV is the approval authority for
   deviations from allowance standards for lodging. Requests for changes and items not listed will be in
   writing and processed by the installation FMO through the MAJCOM/CE to HQ USAF/ILEHO.
   Requests should cite the particular circumstances involved and be fully justified. The estimated cost
   will be provided. When they will add clarity and provide a better understanding of the request, photo-
   graphs, sketches, drawings, or floor plans should be included.
   8.3.5. Accountability. All furnishings will be accounted for in accordance with Chapter 4 of this
   instruction. All recipients of government furnishings will sign for those on AF Form 228 or other
   automated form. Also, items exceeding a unit price of $2,500.00 may require the FMO to establish
   equipment accounts with the installation base supply. Further guidance can be found in AFI 23-111,
   Management of Government Property in Possession of the Air Force.

8.4. General Allowance Information. The information in this paragraph applies to all allowance stan-
dards in this chapter.
   8.4.1. Appliances. All requests for major appliances (washers, dryers, refrigerators, freezers, ranges,
   dishwashers, and ovens) will be coordinated with the installation civil engineer operations and or
   engineering flights to assure proper and adequate electrical and gas service or fuel availability. All
   appliances authorized in this chapter will be repaired by contract if in CONUS, or by the installation
   CE if overseas, in accordance with AFI 32-1001, Operations Management. It is recommended, as a
   minimum, refrigerators in FH should be at least 0.5947 cubic meter (21 cubic feet) in size and an ice-
   maker should be provided. The size of refrigerators in UH will be as locally determined. This applies
   to all new construction, modernization, and replacement projects. Existing refrigerators will not be
   replaced with larger sizes if facility modifications are required to accommodate the larger size refrig-
   erator. Freezers may be authorized for personnel living more than 100 miles from a commissary in
   CONUS, and 50 miles overseas. Government-owned washers and dryers are not authorized in
   CONUS family housing quarters except in Special Command Positions (see AFI 32-6003).
   Self-cleaning ovens are authorized. Replacement of existing units, including back-up stocks, should
   be through attrition. See paragraph 2.7.1. for funding guidance.
   8.4.2. Carpet. Wall-to-wall carpeting is not considered a furnishings item but rather an integral part of
   the quarters. For policy on carpets in GOQs, see AFI 32-6003. Carpeting in high traffic areas of lodg-
   ing and unaccompanied housing may be replaced more frequently than seven years as determined by
   the lodging manager and approved by the services commander/director for lodging and by the housing
   manager or Housing Flight Chief and base civil engineer for UH.
   8.4.3. Window Treatments. Window treatments in UH are furnishings items and specifically defined
   as drapes, curtains, or sheers. Draperies will normally not be replaced at intervals of less than seven
   years. They will be replaced only when no longer serviceable and not solely due to age. MAJCOM
   commander may approve exceptions to the seven-year minimum life-cycle drapery replacement pol-
   icy. NOTE: Blinds, shades, and shutters are not considered furnishings items but rather an integral
   part of the facility. They will be accounted for under the M&R account. Vertical blinds and drapery are
   the standard window treatment in lodging; horizontal blinds are not used.

     8.4.4. Fireplace Accessories. A fireplace tool set is authorized for each functional open-type built-in
     wood-burning fireplace in government-owned or -leased FH, distinguished visitor (DV) lodging
     accommodations, and UH when used by the occupant for open fires. These items are not authorized
     for decorative purposes only and will not be issued for gas fireplaces with artificial logs.
     8.4.5. Furniture. The installation focal point for quarters furniture purchase, repair, cleaning, refinish-
     ing, and reupholstery is the FMO within the installation CE unit. New furniture can be provided from
     base furnishings stocks and GSA contract or local purchase sources. Repair and maintenance may be
     performed in-house or through local service contracts.
     8.4.6. Audio and Video Equipment. Strict adherence to DoD Directive 5535.4, Copyrighted Sound
     and Video Recordings, August 31, 1984, is mandatory.
        8.4.6.1. Audio and video duplicating and playback equipment is not authorized for reproduction
        of copyrighted sound or video recordings unless a copyright license for such reproduction is
        obtained.
        8.4.6.2. Public performances of copyrighted sound or video recordings with permission or
        licenses from copyright owners are not authorized unless a performance is in an isolated area or
        for a deployed unit where English language programming is limited or nonexistent.
            8.4.6.2.1. A public performance is “one transmitted to or performed at a place open to the
            public or at a place where a substantial number of persons outside a normal family circle and
            its social acquaintances are gathered.” A performance in a residential facility (an airman’s dor-
            mitory room) or a physical extension thereof (a dormitory day room) is not a public perfor-
            mance.
            8.4.6.2.2. An isolated area is defined as an area or location that is manned on a short or unac-
            companied tour basis, or an area which, because of language, geographic, and/or climatic con-
            ditions, normal access to public performances or civilian community sources is unavailable.
            8.4.6.2.3. A deployed unit is defined as a DoD unit deployed from its normal home installa-
            tion.
            8.4.6.2.4. The isolated area or deployed unit commander is responsible for maintaining a log
            to verify that each copyrighted sound or video recording is erased after a maximum of 60 days.
     8.4.7. Funding. Family housing (FH) funds, program element P721, will be used to procure FH fur-
     nishings. O&M funds, program element 3400, will be used to procure UH furnishings, including fur-
     nishings for unaccompanied personnel and authorized civilians stationed overseas and required to
     reside off-base. Lodging funding guidelines are outlined in AFI 65-106.
     8.4.8. Procurement of Furnishings. The installation commander will ensure that all furnishings are
     procured in accordance with the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation. While use of GSA Federal
     Supply Schedules are not mandatory, their use is highly recommended since the procurement process
     may be expedited.
     8.4.9. Use of Excess Furnishings. Transfers of excess furnishings will be made to the maximum
     extent possible between family and unaccompanied housing furnishings accounts. Excess furnishings
     may also be transferred to other DoD components. The first priority should be transfers within the
     same funds appropriation (e.g., FH or O&M), followed by transfers between appropriations accounts
     (e.g., FH to UH or vice versa), then to other DoD components. Prior to transfer to DRMO or release
AFI32-6004 3 MARCH 2006                                                                                        29


   to another DoD component, all excesses must be reported to the MAJCOM in accordance with Chap-
   ter 4. These transactions are not reimbursable and are subject to all costs associated with transfer.
   Excess furnishings can not and will not be transferred directly to activities not authorized DRMO sup-
   port (i.e., Airman’s Attic, Thrift Shop, Family Support Centers). Lodging general managers will com-
   ply with AFI 34-204, Services Logistics Support Program.
   8.4.10. Game Equipment. Government-owned game equipment provided in UH will be at no cost to
   the residents. Coin-operated equipment provided by the Army Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES)
   or private contractor is not authorized unless a benefit to the residents is clearly demonstrated and
   approved in writing by the installation commander.
   8.4.11. Bed Linen. Bed linen is defined as sheets (fitted and flat), blankets, pillows, pillowcases, and
   mattress pads, and is authorized for UH. These are considered unit items. The using unit is responsible
   for the initial procurement and replacement.
   8.4.12. Utilities. Any item listed herein that requires electricity, gas, or other type utility or fuel for its
   operation is not authorized unless the type of utility or fuel is available and certified by the BCE.
   8.4.13. Use and Storage of Government Furnishings. No personal items will be stored in the FMO
   warehouse. Personal items for unaccompanied personnel that were shipped at government expense
   that will not fit in the dormitory room or secured dormitory storage area may be stored at government
   expense. For storage of personal items for Priority 1, 2, and 3 occupants at government expense see
   AFI 32-6005, Unaccompanied Housing Management. Visit the Housing Office for orders. In CONUS
   FH, a range and refrigerator will be provided and accounted for as real property installed equipment
   (RPIE). These can be replaced with personally owned equipment if the installation commander has
   not established a local policy prohibiting such replacement.

8.5. Unaccompanied Housing Allowances. The allowances for enlisted dormitories, UNCOQ, and
UOQ, as defined on real property records, are provided in Attachment 6.
   8.5.1. Washers and Dryers. Washers and dryers in government-owned or leased unaccompanied quar-
   ters will be provided at no cost to the individual occupant. These may be contractor-owned or leased
   or government-owned. However, government-owned washers and dryers will be provided in these
   quarters unless it is clearly demonstrated in each instance to be in the best interest of the government.
   Instances may occur where contractual services are not available or these services are not as econom-
   ical as providing government equipment. Procurement of government-owned washers and dryers for
   either initial installation or replacement purposes is not permitted unless a comparative cost analysis
   is accomplished. Once the analysis is completed, the BCE will determine the most economical means
   of providing support and obtain installation commander approval. The cost analysis will not be lim-
   ited to a few appliances but will compare the relative advantages of operating a complete facility with
   contractor-owned or -leased equipment versus government-owned equipment. Space permitting, as a
   minimum one washer will be provided for every 12 occupants or fraction thereof and one dryer per 8
   occupants. Where military family units have been approved and converted to unaccompanied person-
   nel quarters, washers and dryers will be provided as required. NOTE: Government-owned equipment
   presently installed may be used until no longer economically feasible.

8.6. Overseas Housing Allowances. The allowances for housekeeping quarters in areas with JFTR
weight limitations, loaner kits, and housekeeping quarters for unaccompanied military and authorized
civilian personnel required to reside off-base are provided in Attachment 7.
30                                                                           AFI32-6004 3 MARCH 2006


     8.6.1. Loaner Kits. Military and civilian personnel are authorized loaner kits of housekeeping furnish-
     ings for temporary use. These items are required to equip quarters with only essential items on a loan
     basis in lieu of providing TLA. Loaner kits are for use when personnel are awaiting their personally
     owned furniture in full JFTR weight allowance areas or when departing personnel desire to ship their
     personally owned furniture prior to departure in order to meet a preferred arrival date at the next duty
     station. The length of time for which a loaner kit may be issued will be determined locally unless oth-
     erwise set by the MAJCOM.
     8.6.2. Support Authorization for Unaccompanied Military or Civilian Personnel Assigned in a JFTR
     Weight-Limited Area. Unaccompanied military or civilian personnel assigned in a JFTR weight-lim-
     ited area overseas may be authorized government-owned furnishings. The installation commander or
     designee must determine that adequate government-owned quarters are not available on base and the
     individual is authorized to reside off base. This policy is applicable to personnel of all grades when
     authorized to reside off base. Furnishings will not be issued to any military member in the grades of
     E-4 or below who choose to reside off base for personal reasons or convenience.
     8.6.3. Items Issued for the Duration of Tour. This authorization applies to personnel authorized to
     reside off base in private rental or government-leased quarters. The items listed may be retained for
     the duration of the sponsor’s tour of duty in lieu of being issued as part of a loaner kit, provided they
     are not furnished by the landlord in private rental quarters or by the government in leased quarters.
        8.6.3.1. Appliances. Appliances are normally provided due to the utility differences from that of
        CONUS. The list of appliances authorized include ranges, microwave ovens, refrigerators, clothes
        washers and dryers, and portable dishwashers. The size of the refrigerator issued will be deter-
        mined by facility constraints and or family size as determined by BCE.
        8.6.3.2. Storage Units. Due to the varied construction practices for private rental quarters, ward-
        robes, kitchen cabinets, and storage units are authorized when they are not built in or provided by
        the landlord.
        8.6.3.3. Area Rugs and Pad. Area rugs and pads are authorized if wall-to-wall carpeting is not
        installed in the quarters.
        8.6.3.4. Miscellaneous Items. Electrical transformers, space heaters, smoke detectors, carbon
        monoxide detectors, and fire extinguishers are authorized when approved by MAJCOM. Electri-
        cal transformers may be issued due to differences in local electrical currents. Space heaters may be
        issued to supplement the primary heating source of the quarters when it is determined to be inade-
        quate. Smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, and fire extinguishers may be issued for the
        personal safety of any member residing off base. All items may be issued only when not provided
        by the landlord.
        8.6.3.5. Backup Stocks. Overseas FMOs will establish a backup stock of FH and unaccompanied
        personnel on- and off-base housing furnishings.

8.7. Special Allowances. The facilities listed in this paragraph are supported by and will receive furnish-
ings from the furnishings management element of the civil engineer housing flight.
     8.7.1. Airman Leadership School (ALS) Dormitories. Installations with in-residence ALS programs
     and student dormitories are authorized to use the dormitories section of Attachment 6.
AFI32-6004 3 MARCH 2006                                                                             31


  8.7.2. ICBM LCF Sleeping and Entertainment Areas. See AS 462, Furnishings for Alert Facilities,
  Pilot Lounges, Strategic Missile Lounges, and Visitation Centers, Parts C and D.
  8.7.3. Quarters of Allied Exchange Officers. Installations housing allied exchange officers in FH are
  authorized to use Attachment 7. This applies also to CONUS FH supporting foreign nation allied
  exchange officers. Furnishings may be provided from available assets in the FMO warehouse.
  8.7.4. Fire Department Sleeping and Entertainment Areas. See AS 490, Civil Engineering Fire Pro-
  tection Support and Aircraft Rescue Equipment, Part C.
  8.7.5. Lodging Facilities. The standards in Attachment 3 of AFI 34-246, Air Force Lodging Pro-
  gram, will be used as the furnishing allowance for lodging facilities. Only furnishing items such as
  case goods (beds, chests, dressers), seating, appliances, and lighting will be procured by the FMO.
  The procurement of amenities is the responsibility of lodging.
  8.7.6. Supplemental furnishings for general officer quarters.

Contingency Lodging —This type of lodging usually exists under two scenarios:
- At main operating bases, aerial en-route ports or fixed locations where contingency lodging normally
consists of pickled, vacant or inactive quarters or community facilities (such as fitness centers, commu-
nity centers, unused hangars, etc.). These facilities are temporarily opened to accommodate large influxes
of en-route TDY personnel who cannot be housed in regular base lodging accommodations.
- At forward operating locations or deployed sites (such as SW Asia, Bosnia) where Prime RIBS person-
nel operate either "tent city" or leased facilities that are considered to be under "field conditions". Nor-
mally field conditions call for cots and sleeping bags; however, if an installation commander desires to
enhance living conditions for deployed extended TDY personnel by providing furnishings such as beds,
wardrobes, etc. use the procedures listed above for fixed locations. When rotations of personnel start (e.g.
AEF personnel), and there is no end in sight to the deployment, then commanders should consider con-
verting contingency lodging to contingency dormitories which are managed/operated by units in conjunc-
tion with civil engineering similar to permanent dormitories at permanent installations.

household goods (overseas only).
Lodging —VOQ, VQ, VAQ, and TLF.

                       QUARTERS IMPROVEMENT COMMITTEE (QIC)

A3.1. Quarters Improvement Committee (QIC). The QIC is intended to be the base’s primary forum
to identify facilities and furnishings requirements for unaccompanied and transient personnel. The QIC
ensures these requirements are maintained, renovated, and replaced on a timely basis by following a
Quarters Improvement Plan (QIP).
   A3.1.1. The installation commander will establish the QIC, which is charged with reviewing the
   annual base UH inventory, use, requirements, and standards. The most important function of the QIC
   is developing and supporting the QIP. (See Attachment 4 for a sample of a QIP.)
       A3.1.1.1. The QIC should meet at least semi-annually (may meet more often depending on local
       needs) to:

troller will (1) provide appropriated funds for this plan to the maximum extent possible, and (2) assist
BCE in obtaining year-end funds for projects not identified in the normal budget process.

A3.6. Mechanics of the QIC:
     A3.6.1. QIC Meeting Preparation Checklist. A meeting preparation checklist helps the FMO set up an
     effective QIC meeting with tasks and target dates. The following is a sample checklist:

A3.7. QIC Agenda . Since the meetings of the QIC occur only twice per year, a number of standard
items must be covered during each meeting. To make the meetings as efficient as possible, an agenda is
prepared. A sample QIC meeting agenda is shown below. It contains the items that should be covered dur-
ing the meetings and allows for other topics to be discussed as well.

                            QUARTERS IMPROVEMENT PLAN (QIP)

A4.1. The Quarters Improvement Plan (QIP). The QIP addresses five-year furnishings requirements
and should include budget input for the current fiscal year (FY) and the next four FYs. This document
should be the basis for the furnishings management input to the base financial plan for O&M funds.
   A4.1.1. It addresses both APF and NAF facility and furnishings projects and requirements.
   A4.1.2. It is developed through a base quorum called the QIC.
   A4.1.3. The QIP should address all elements of the lodging and unaccompanied facility living envi-
   ronment. Standards for the facility, furnishings, interior design, decorative themes, privacy, recreation,
   leisure, convenience, storage, parking and security are a few of the basic elements that should be
   addressed in the QIP.
   A4.1.4. Although there is no standard format for a QIP, this sample represents a composite of several
   successful base QIP formats and covers the desired information. Individual bases may expand or
   reduce the amount of information required depending on local circumstances.

A4.2. Elements of the QIP:
   A4.2.1. The first page of the QIP should be a statement of goals, usually in a letter format, signed by
   the installation commander. The commander’s remarks are an important introduction to the QIP
   because they outline the installation’s commitment to quality living conditions for all personnel living
   in unaccompanied housing and lodging facilities. The installation’s goals to meet QIP standards and
   an overview of the QIP are included.
   A4.2.2. A brief statement about the base mission, number of people supported in dormitories and
   lodging facilities orient the reader to the size and scope of QIP requirements (reference base Dormi-
   tory Master Plan). The QIP should address the condition of the installation’s unaccompanied housing
   and lodging facilities and furnishings in broad terms, such as: “______ AFB has 17 dormitories. Three
   are 1+1 configuration and 14 require conversion.”
   A4.2.3. Concluding remarks usually include the commander’s request for active support from all base
   organizations participating in the QIC to use available resources and funds in providing better living
   conditions.

A4.3. Planning Philosophy:
   A4.3.1. This portion of the QIP addresses individual base planning assumptions, detailed goals, and
   special emphasis areas. Planning assumptions may include statements addressing UPH occupancy
   rates, projected MILCON or project funding availability, projected base O&M funding availability,
   MAJCOM funds or MAJCOM directives and policy. Goals should be total quality living facilities that
   the installation wants to achieve, and should address items such as:
       A4.3.1.1. Providing single-person rooms.
       A4.3.1.2. Upgrade efforts.
       A4.3.1.3. Lodging facility rates and NAF upgrade support.
46                                                                          AFI32-6004 3 MARCH 2006


        A4.3.1.4. Future mission changes and needs.
     A4.3.2. Special emphasis areas include:
        A4.3.2.1. The need for senior leadership involvement in the QIC and QIP.
        A4.3.2.2. Teamwork required between CE, services, budget, supply, and contracting.
        A4.3.2.3. Large furniture orders (whole building concept).
        A4.3.2.4. Ordering as a package.
        A4.3.2.5. Receiving furnishings.
        A4.3.2.6. Displacement of personnel.
        A4.3.2.7. Relocation of occupants.

A4.4. Facility Standards. (Reference Facility Design Guide for Enlisted Dormitories at:
http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/dc/products/dcproducts/asp) and the VQ Design Guide at:
https://www-r.afsv.mil/LD.
     A4.4.1. Facility standards are desired features for all dormitory, UOQ/UNCOQ, and lodging build-
     ings. These standards can be existing or desired and can be obtained through construction or alteration
     projects.
     A4.4.2. The QIP should address the features for each functional part of the facility. Dormitory fea-
     tures, for example, would include:
        A4.4.2.1. Sleeping rooms.
        A4.4.2.2. Vanity areas.
        A4.4.2.3. Shared bathrooms or central latrines.
        A4.4.2.4. Common areas (laundry rooms, kitchens, dayrooms, hallways, storage rooms, guest
        bathrooms).
        A4.4.2.5. Exterior grounds.
        A4.4.2.6. Main entrance.
        A4.4.2.7. Exterior of the building.
        A4.4.2.8. Lock system.
        A4.4.2.9. Parking area.
     A4.4.3. The features should be listed with as much detail as possible; these lists can be used to assist
     BCE planners during design reviews for building projects.
     A4.4.4. Detailed room features may include:
        A4.4.4.1. Electrical outlets (see the Dormitory Design Guide).
        A4.4.4.2. Fire/smoke detector.
        A4.4.4.3. Woodwork stained, not painted.
        A4.4.4.4. Individual room thermostat for heat, air conditioning, and air flow.

A4.5. Furnishings Standards. Furnishings standards for unaccompanied housing facilities should also
be detailed. Durability and functionality of dormitory furnishings is important to ensure years of service-
ability under tough dormitory use conditions.

A4.6. Construction Characteristics. Suggested construction characteristics for dormitory furniture are
as follows:
   A4.6.1. Solid wood or solid wood core furniture.
   A4.6.2. Heavy-gauge hinges.
   A4.6.3. Lockable wardrobes or closets.
   A4.6.4. Hinges on drop-lid desks with continuous heavy-duty piano hinge with adjustable flap sup-
   ports on side.
   A4.6.5. Dovetail drawers with double metal side rails and stopping device.
   A4.6.6. Finished backs on all furniture.
   A4.6.7. Adjustable leveling legs on all large pieces of furniture.
   A4.6.8. Lamination on desks and table tops.
   A4.6.9. Sturdy chair fabric without protrusions such as buttons or pleats.
   A4.6.10. Audio cord holes predrilled in entertainment units and desks.

A4.7. Lodging Furnishings. Furnishings standards for lodging facilities should also be as detailed as
possible and include rooms, hallways, front desk, lounge, laundry, and entrance ways.

A4.8. Visits. The QIC should visit various unaccompanied housing and lodging facilities and select a fur-
nishings standard brand for each type facility. Furnishings standards establish a style and approved layout
of furnishings for each type of facility (VOQ, VAQ, TLF, dormitories, and UOQ). Styles will vary accord-
ing to facility layout, type of occupant, and uses.

A4.9. Dayroom Furnishings. Many bases have instituted a policy to select dormitory dayroom furnish-
ings of a different style and manufacturer than dormitory sleeping room furnishings. This should reduce
the migration of dayroom furnishings into sleeping rooms.

A4.10. Restrictions. Efforts should be made to restrict the different types of furnishings used in base
unaccompanied housing and lodging facilities to the extent possible. Normally, one style/type of furniture
48                                                                         AFI32-6004 3 MARCH 2006


should be used in unaccompanied housing and another for transient facilities. This minimizes FMO
backup stock requirements and makes redistribution of furnishings between different facilities easier.

A4.11. Guide. Furnishings Allowance, Chapter 8, is used as a guide for what items should be provided
in unaccompanied housing and lodging facilities. Furnishings standards for lodging facilities should be
listed separately from permanent party facilities, as types of items vary significantly.

A4.12. Style. Furnishings should be of the same style within facilities to avoid a mismatched or piece-
meal appearance. Furnishings should be purchased in “mass replacement” buys to the maximum extent
possible, to ensure wood tones and finishes are of the same batch delivered by the manufacturer. If mass
replacement is not feasible, then purchases should be incrementally made by the complete building, by
entire floor, or by matched room set to ensure matched assets to the greatest extent possible.

A4.13. Replacement. The average life expectancy of furnishings is presented in Table A4.1.

A4.14. Facility Data:
     A4.14.1. Facility data should provide a profile of the history and current condition of all unaccompa-
     nied housing and lodging facilities on the installation. The data should be used with adequacy stan-
     dards in AFI 32-6005 for unaccompanied housing and AFI 34-246 for lodging and installation
     facilities listed in the base QIP to identify work requirements to the BCE.
     A4.14.2. The following is a suggested format for an information worksheet which should be com-
     pleted for each facility (* denotes “must have” data):
        A4.14.2.1. Building number*.

       A4.14.2.18. Condition of common-use areas.

A4.15. Furnishings Data:
   A4.15.1. Furnishings data should include information about the type and age of furnishings in use for
   each unaccompanied housing facility. Information about the brand of furniture, how old it is, and its
   general condition is good data that can be used in base budget inputs to justify and articulate replace-
   ment furnishings needs.
   A4.15.2. Items are listed using supply national stock number (NSN) and nomenclature, so that this
   information is readily available for requisitioning purposes. The information required is as follows:
       A4.15.2.1. Item needed.
          A4.15.2.1.1. Stock number.
          A4.15.2.1.2. Quantity required.
          A4.15.2.1.3. Quantity on-hand.

A4.19. Furnishings Requirements:
     A4.19.1. The QIC must determine the price of furnishings standards and actual replacement or new
     buys for the base dormitory and lodging facilities. The furnishings requirements section of the QIP
     presents this cost data. This should be an easy-to-read synopsis of what furnishings items are needed
     by the facility. Unit costs and extended costs are both listed so those requirements can be broken down
     into smaller phases, if necessary, as when they are dependent on the availability of funds.
     A4.19.2. Table A4.3. is an example of a furnishings requirements table.

Table A4.3. Furnishings Requirements.

A4.20. Sample Quarters Improvement Plan (QIP):
   A4.20.1. The following represents the content of a sample QIP.
      A4.20.1.1. Preface:
          A4.20.1.1.1. The purpose of this plan is to provide a comprehensive program for upgrading
          the permanent party and lodging facilities at ________ AFB, ___. The plan will cover the
          period FY95 through FY02. Inputs are to be coordinated with members of the Quarters
          Improvement Committee (QIC). The plan will be reviewed annually.
          A4.20.1.1.2. Under the Unit Dorm Management Concept, the unaccompanied housing and
          lodging facilities are assigned to and managed by several organizations. Under a consolidated
          management concept, dorm managers manage assets from a central point. However, overall
          furnishings management is administered by the furnishings management office of the housing
          flight of civil engineering. The installation commander is the chairman of the QIC program
          and this plan. The duties may be delegated to the commander's deputy, but no lower than the
          support group commander.
          A4.20.1.1.3. The office of primary responsibility is the Furnishings Management Office
          (FMO), ext ____, ____ CSG/CEH, which will prepare, distribute, and direct implementation
          of this plan.
      A4.20.1.2. Mission Statement. The Quarters Improvement Committee at _______ Air Force Base
      is dedicated to the continuous upgrade and improvement of all unaccompanied and transient facil-

            A4.20.1.4.7. Facilities are equipped with ____________(brand/style) furniture purchased in
            __________.

A4.21. Sample Quality of Life Improvement Program. The QIC prepares the Quality of Life Pro-
gram, which provides a plan for comprehensive upgrade for base facilities and furnishings. The program
includes a brief description of the current situation at the installation and the assumptions on which the
plan is based. A mission statement clarifies the purpose of the plan at each installation. The plan also out-
lines a strategy for plan implementation and execution, and describes each participant’s responsibilities.
The following paragraphs present sample content for a Quality of Life Improvement Program plan.
     A4.21.1. Installation:
     ____ Fighter Wing. _______ Air Force Base,_______ 12345-6789.
     A4.21.2. Unaccompanied and Transient Housing Situation. A comprehensive master plan is required
     to upgrade all unaccompanied and transient living quarters to current Air Force standards. Command
     support for all levels is essential to improve the facilities and thereby enhance the quality of life of our
     unaccompanied personnel and visitors. Concern for occupants of dormitories and lodging facilities
     can best be demonstrated by credible and comprehensive planning that will ensure improvements in
     existing structures as well as replacement facilities.
     A4.21.3. Assumptions:
        A4.21.3.1. The improvement of dormitories and lodging facilities is one of the most important
        projects on _______ AFB.
        A4.21.3.2. Life expectancy of interior and exterior paint is 4 years.
        A4.21.3.3. Life expectancy of carpet is 7 years.
        A4.21.3.4. Fourteen dormitories will be improved through the military construction program
        (MILCON). The project will involve extensive interior and exterior modifications.
        A4.21.3.5. Life expectancy for furniture is 10-12 years.
        A4.21.3.6. Labor and material cost will rise significantly each year.
        A4.21.3.7. Base O&M funds will continue to be limited.
     A4.21.4. Mission. The Quality of Life Improvement Program’s mission is to provide the best living
     environment possible for the unaccompanied personnel of _______ AFB, and to develop a long-range
     plan to upgrade all dormitories and lodging facilities.
     A4.21.5. Execution. The installation commander, deputy, or support group commander working
     through the QIC, will ensure proper actions are taken to implement this plan. Close coordination is
     required among services, civil engineering, HQ (MAJCOM), and the QIC.
        A4.21.5.1. The dormitory facilities will be upgraded according to the schedule outlined herein.
        Complete study of each building will be made prior to submission of work requests to ensure all
        required, deferred, and future work is incorporated into each project, thereby minimizing the mod-
        ification of completed work.
AFI32-6004 3 MARCH 2006                                                                                53


     A4.21.5.2. As far as practical, serviceable furniture and drapes from facilities being renovated
     will be redistributed to other non-upgraded facilities, thus replacing unserviceable items. This
     action will significantly reduce replacement item expense while dormitory upgrading is in
     progress and will also allow for maximum use of existing furniture and accessories.

mation on a quarterly basis, as a minimum.

1.4.9. Ensures furnishings are purchased from the correct accounts.
1.5.1. Furnishings budget requirements are identified for UH, FH (including GOQs) and lodging.
1.6.1.1. Furnishes budget inputs to the BCE and Services Commanders.
1.8.1. Authorized appropriated fund (APF) furnishings budget requirements are identified for lodging and
requirements are coordinated with FMO for logistical support of receipt, handling and issue. However,
the Services Commander/Director is responsible for advocating for APF resources (BOS PEXXX96F)
needed for VQs and TLFs through the installation comptroller.
2.1. Furnishings and Appliances Budgets. The BCE, through the housing flight and operations flight,
consolidates requirements for the procurement, management, maintenance and repair (M&R) of all gov-
ernment-owned APF furnishings and domestic appliances for UH and FH. FMO, through the housing
flight chief and lodging management, obtains budget input or estimates, by program element, and pro-
vides them to the BCE resource advisor (RA) who, based on the program element, forwards to the appli-
cable resource advisor/comptroller who advocates for the listed program element. For example, fire
department furnishings requirements are advocated in Facilities Operation (FO) PE (PE XXX79F). Dor-
mitories furnishing requirements are advocated in the permanent party UH, PE (PE XX679F). These esti-
mates include requirements for furnishings initial issue, upgrade, M&R and replacement programs for
UH and FH. Lodging programs, through the services commander, for items to be procured with NAF
funds and advocates through the installation comptroller for APF lodging requirements (PE XXX96F).

(See AFI 34-209, Nonappropriated Fund Financial Management and Accounting, and AFI 34-214, Pro-
cedures for Nonappropriated Fund Financial Management and Accounting). AFI 65-106, Appropriated
Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities, specifies
when APF funds may be used for lodging furnishings and appliances.
2.1.2. Use O&M funds (PE XX679) to provide furnishings for government-owned UH and for unaccom-
panied personnel residing in overseas rental housing. Operating cost, to include UH furnishings and
appliances for permanent party UH, is funded from UH PEXX679F.
2.1.4. Use APF and NAF for furnishings requirements related to facility construction, maintenance, and
repair projects in accordance with AFI 65-106, Figure 6.1.
2.3.3. For UH authorized appliances, the funding source is the permanent party UH PE (PEXX679F). See
Attachment 6 for authorized appliances.
2.3.4. For authorized lodging appliances (VQs and TLFs), the Lodging Manager provides requirements to
the FMO. The Services Commander advocates for BOS PEXXX96F funding through the Installation
Comptroller. See Attachment 6 for authorized appliances.
2.5. Furnishings Repair. Evaluate APF furnishings and appliance requirements for contract and in-house
repair, including furnishings associated with facility repair and construction projects. The BCE should
estimate funds requirements for contract and in-house repair of UH and FH furnishings from budgetary
data provided by UH management and family housing. Determine required items, quantities and repair
costs, and provide to the civil engineering RA for inclusion in the applicable O&M and MFH financial
plans. Consolidate lodging furnishings and appliances repair requirements in the CE furnishings repair
contract under a separate line item and fund in accordance with AFI 65-106. The Services Commander
will advocate for VQ and TLF furnishings repair funding through their installation comptroller. Incorpo-
rate lodging furnishings and appliance repairs as a separate line item in the CE repair program, but fund in
accordance with AFI 65-106. Identify and budget Services requirements and estimates through the Ser-
vices Commander/Director. Describe each item needed and justify estimates for quantities and repair
costs.
2.7.1. Appliances. Use locally established procurement procedures.
2.7.1.1. Family Housing. To determine the proper cost category for FH appliances, use the principle that
freestanding is an operations cost (P-721) and installed is an M&R cost (P-722). Purchase FH freestand-
ing (not built in) appliances, such as stoves, refrigerators, stoves, with 721.4 funds. Account for FH
built-in appliances, such as dishwashers, built-in ovens and cooktops, in P-722.
2.7.1.2. Unaccompanied Housing (UH). Purchase UH appliances with O&M funds in PEXX679.
2.7.1.3. Visiting Quarters (VQ) and Temporary Lodging Facilities (TLF). Purchase and repair appliances
for existing VQ and TLF with O&M funds and account for in BOS PEXXX96F. Purchase appliances for
new construction of a VQ with O&M funds in BOS PEXXX96F, and purchase appliances for new con-
struction of a TLF with NAF.
2.7.1.4. For new UH and VQ construction or major renovations, the housing and lodging managers,
respectively, coordinate with FMO to ensure compatibility of appliances with utility connections (gas,
water, sewer and electric) and space constraints.

Table 2.1. Deleted.
2.8. Supplies. Do not include funds for expendable supplies and grounds maintenance equipment items
for UH and lodging day-to-day operations (non-furnishings allowance) in the FMO budget. For perma-
nent party UH, the using unit [squadron under unit dormitory management concept or Consolidated Dor-
mitory Management Operations (CDMO)] budgets for and purchases these items using PE XX679F. For
pipeline (student) dormitories, DO budgets for and purchases supplies.
3.8. Repair and Replacement. Charge appliance and furnishings maintenance, repair or replacement as
directed in AFI 65-106.
3.8.6. When available, immediately issue replacement appliances to the customer. When replacement
items are not available, adjust the records and requisition the needed items. Process damaged items for
repair or turn-in to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO). The lodging manager
decides when to process lodging property into the installation recycling center in lieu of transfer to
DRMO.
3.8.9. Limit appliance repair to only items authorized by allowance standards in Attachment 6. Use FH
funds to repair appliances for family housing. Use NAF for repair of items purchased with NAF (AFI
65-106).
5.1.2.2. Personnel who qualify for government housing but elect to live off base and receive a housing
allowance (basic allowance for quarters [BAQ] or living quarters allowance [LQA]). Government civilian
employees must be entitled to LQA to receive government provided furnishings/appliance support. Civil-
ians in Alaska and Hawaii are also authorized use of loaner kits (in accordance with paragraph 8.6.1.)
regardless of LQA entitlement when relocating from outside the local area.
6.4. Management. Management is defined as budgeting for new and replacement appliances and
accounting for items in use. The housing flight manages government-owned appliances in UH (perma-
nent and pipeline) and family housing. The lodging manager manages appliances in VQs and TLFs.
6.5.1. In CONUS, the operations flight is responsible for contract maintenance and repair (M&R) of
appliances in FH, UH and lodging unless good business practices determine the responsibility should be
elsewhere. The BCE competitively sources the appliance M&R program by separate contract, incorporat-
ing into an existing furnishings management contract, or as an addendum to the housing maintenance con-
tract. When adding appliance M&R to the housing maintenance contract, provide separate contract line
item numbers (CLIN) for O&M (PE XXX96F, PEXX679F), NAF, and FH (721.4). . Appliances in
CONUS FH are RPIE. Refer to www.afcesa.af.mil for a statement of work (SOW) template and market-
ing analyses for outsourcing appliance management and M&R.
6.5.2. The operations flight is responsible for providing a QAE and technical assistance. Overseas, the
operations flight is responsible for the M&R and replacement of FH, UH and lodging appliances using the
appropriate funds cite. When including M&R and replacement of UH and lodging in the housing mainte-
nance contract, use separate funds cites for O&M (PE XXX96f, BOS (PE XXX679f), FH (PE 721.4), and
NAF. Do not use housing funds for this purpose. When dormitory and lodging appliances are included
in the housing maintenance contract, the housing flight is responsible for QAE duties, and develops local
procedures to manage appliances in control of the contractor.
