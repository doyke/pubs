Attachment 2—EXERCISE SPECIFIC WRITTEN PROCEDURES/PARTICIPANT BRIEFING 11


1. General. To ensure the safe use of AE during training, strict adherence to this instruction is
required. Safety principles outlined are also applicable to off-base evaluation/ training sites when
not in conflict with host base regulations. 482 FW members will coordinate with host base safety
personnel to ensure local safety regulations are being followed. All personnel who handle, load,
dispose, maintain or transport explosives as part of an exercise or training must receive
Explosive Safety training. In addition, Attachment 2 of this instruction and a Risk Assessment
(RA), which has been approved by the responsible commander, must be completed prior to the
start of any exercise or training that involves AE. The RA must then be coordinated with 482
FW/Safety (482 FW/SEW) prior to implementation of the exercise or training. (See Attachment
2, Exercise Specific Written Procedures/ Participant Briefing).
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. It is the responsibility of all commanders and their designated official’s to ensure that
     live ammunition is not introduced into an exercise where live and blank ammunition (ammo)
     could be commingled or mistaken for each other. (Note: Munitions operations center issues
     blank ammunition and must perform a 100% visual inspection of assets to ensure no live
     rounds are present). Factory sealed blank ammunition containers need not be opened to
     verify no live rounds are present.
     2.2. The squadron Additional Duty Weapons Safety Representative (ADWSR) assigned to
     the unit that is taking part in the exercise or training validates that weapons safety training
     has been provided to exercise personnel and validates facilities, equipment, and work areas
     are complying with weapons safety standards.

   2.3. Exercise Team Chief (ETC), and supervisors must know the safety standards that apply
   to their functional area, monitor for hazards, ensure weapons safety standards are met, report
   mishaps, and enforce the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
   2.4. All assigned personnel are responsible for complying with explosive safety standards,
   instructions, and Technical Orders (TO); identifying hazards, using protective equipment,
   and reporting injury or impaired health conditions to supervisor.
   2.5. A Risk Assessment (RA) must be completed and approved by 482 FW/ Weapons Safety
   (SEW) office prior to any exercise or training involving AE.
   2.6. The responsible commander will approve the RA in writing ensuring personnel not
   normally associated with explosive operations are not exposed to explosive hazards as
   directed by AFMAM 91-201, Para7.27.3.
   2.7. The supervisor in charge or ETC that has been designated by the Commander will:
      2.7.1. Prior to issuing blank ammunition, the ETC or supervisor must have step-by-step
      instructions for issuing, turn-in and controlling all blank ammunition and that all
      containers are properly marked, stored and accounted for (See Attachment 2, Para A8.1,
      Expended Brass and Turn in Procedures).
      2.7.2. Visually inspect all blank ammunition utilized by exercise members prior to use in
      any/all field exercises.
      2.7.3. Supervise the loading of all magazines with blank ammunition. Ensure all
      magazines that are loaded with blank ammo are clearly marked with blue tape so that
      they can be distinguished from live magazine loads.
      2.7.4. Ensure that all magazines containing blank ammunition are properly marked with
      blue tape, accounted for and stored during exercises when not in use. The storage area
      will be maintained in such a way as to ensure that no live ammunition will be allowed to
      mix with blank ammunition. If needed, ammunition will be placed in a metal container
      and marked “Blank Ammo” with blue lettering on the outside of the container.

   and that magazines that contain blank ammo are marked with blue tape. Paint all cans
   containing live ammo red and clearly label them with “LIVE AMMUNITION” statements.
   Letters must be at least 2‖ high and in a contrasting color. When stored in the same facility,
   ensure live and blank ammo are not stored in the same container. Return all unused AE back
   to storage location at the end of the day or after the exercise.
13. Expended brass turn in procedures.
   13.1. All expended AE residue will be retrieved after each event and turned-in at the point of
   issue. Residue will be inspected, separated by type and caliber, handled and stored separately
   from live AE. Use attachment 2, Para A8.1 for turn in procedures and accountability.
14. Reconciliation and certification of expenditures process.
