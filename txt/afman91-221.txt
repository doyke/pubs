                                              Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This Manual, in conjunction with AFI 91-204, provides guidance for
investigating and reporting nuclear, guided missile, explosives and chemical agents, and directed
energy mishaps. The sole purpose of these safety investigations is to prevent future mishaps.
Investigations to gather evidence for claims, litigation, disciplinary and adverse administrative
actions, and for all purposes other than mishap prevention are not covered by this Manual.
     1.1.1. Nuclear Accidents and incidents
        1.1.1.1. Nuclear accidents and incidents will be reported using flagwords only
        (BROKEN ARROW, BENT SPEAR). There is no associated mishap class (i.e. A, B, C,
        D) with a BROKEN ARROW or BENT SPEAR mishap report.
        1.1.1.2. When investigating BENT SPEAR or BROKEN ARROW events follow Class A
        mishap procedures for board composition, mishap reporting timelines and investigation
        procedures in accordance with this manual and AFI 91-204.
     1.1.2. Guided missiles, explosives and chemical agents, and directed energy mishaps will be
     reported and classified IAW AFI 91-204 Class A, B, C, D, and E criteria.
1.2. Mishap Category. Reference Figure 1.1 to determine if the mishap should be reported
IAW this Manual.
1.3. Mishap Severity Classification. Once it is determined that a non-nuclear mishap is
reportable, classify mishap by total direct mishap cost and the severity of injury/occupational
illness. For nuclear mishaps follow guidance in paragraph 1.4.
     1.3.1. When determining the mishap severity classification for nuclear mishaps, be sure to
     reference the appropriate security classification guide and mark the report appropriately.
1.4. Flagwords. Flagwords are used to identify nuclear accidents (BROKEN ARROW),
incidents (BENT SPEAR), and deficiencies (DULL SWORD). Flagword definitions may be
subjective and it is up to the investigator to determine the best flagword to describe the mishap.
If the event status changes after submitting an original report, submit another report using the
new flagword. Upgrade the flagword only when time-critical responses are required. Do NOT
downgrade the flagword of nuclear mishap reports without the concurrence of AFSC/SEW.
Additional Flagwords are contained in AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, cross-reference with
this guidance to ensure you are reporting the correct Flagword.
     1.4.1. NUCFLASH: Includes accidental, unauthorized, or unexplained events that could
     create the risk of war, meeting any of the following criteria:
        1.4.1.1. Accidental, unauthorized, or unexplained actual or possible nuclear detonation

  (e.g., a bomb exploded), include the cost of the item (not including intentionally jettisoned
  items).
  1.5.4. Intentional Functioning. If a weapon or explosive was intentionally functioned, do not
  include the cost of the item.
     1.5.4.1. For test missions where recovery was expected, but not accomplished, include
     the cost of these items to determine classification, unless test objectives were met.
  1.5.5. Parachute-recovered Weapons. Include the repair/replacement costs of all components
  where recovery was expected, but not accomplished, related to abnormal events or clearly
  excessive damage. Abnormal events include torn parachutes, late recovery initiation, failure
  of a parachute to blossom or release, high winds, etc. Excessive damage includes buckling of
  the main fuselage, fire at impact, destruction of the payload section, etc. The cost of expected
  damage to parachute-recovered weapons resulting solely from surface impact during an
  otherwise normal recovery sequence is an operational expense and not reportable. Do not
  include cost of recovery since recovery is normally a mission objective for recoverable
  weapons.

   and refer to it in all related correspondence. Assign local reporting number, and the following
   space specific guidance.
       6.1.7.1. Date of Mishap [eight digits (YYYYMMDD)]. Use the local date, not the Zulu
       or Coordinated Universal Time (CUT) day.
       6.1.7.2. Installation Code [four digits].
           6.1.7.2.1. For mishaps that did not occur on a military base or property, use the base
           of the unit that experienced the loss.
       6.1.7.3. Unit Control Number [four digits](Optional). Use separate sets of four-character
       combinations (three digits and one letter) for unit control numbers. Assign the numbers
       consecutively for each mishap for each fiscal year. MAJCOMs may assign block
       numbers for those disciplines requiring them.
AFMAN91-221 8 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                   21


6.2. Multiple Categories. When reporting multiple categories, refer to appropriate manuals that
implement AFI 91-204 to provide all required information, and include necessary addressees in
the reports.
   6.2.1. The objectives for reporting nuclear, guided missile, explosives and chemical agents,
   and directed energy safety deficiencies are to prevent accidents and incidents, minimize their
   effects if they should occur, and reduce the occurrence of safety deficiencies. The
   requirement for reporting nuclear weapon system safety deficiencies supports the objectives
   of AFI 91-101, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program. The requirements for reporting
   nuclear reactor system and radiological safety deficiencies support the objectives of AFI 40-
   201, Managing Radioactive Materials in the Air Force.
   6.2.2. While the results of safety investigations play a direct role in the mishap prevention
   process, the indiscriminate use of statistical comparisons between units can jeopardize
   accurate reporting and are inappropriate due to the rare nature of mishaps. Do NOT make
   statistical comparisons of different commands or units using mishap reports as a source.
   6.2.3. Because the criteria for the submission of safety deficiency reports are so broad,
   comparing nuclear safety statistics between commands and operating units may NOT provide
   accurate trend information for managerial analysis. Use safety deficiency reports only to
   identify potential problems and corrective measures. Do NOT publish statistical comparisons
   of different commands or units using safety deficiency reports as a source.
6.3. Preparing reports for weapons mishaps.
   6.3.1. Class A and B mishaps require both message/AFSAS and formal reports. Report other
   class mishaps by message/AFSAS.
   6.3.2. MAJCOMs may supplement their addressees to include, any internal organizations
   with a need-to-know. They may use AIGs (Addressee Indicator Group) to add addressees,
   within the command, as recipients of selected safety reports. Do not include addressees
   outside of MAJCOM AIG listings.
       6.3.2.1. Do not use an AL for reports that contain little or no information of worldwide
       mishap prevention potential. Use routine handling procedures for AL addressees.
   6.3.3. Send reports conveying significant safety information peculiar to the nuclear weapon
   system to other Air Force MAJCOMs possessing like systems.
   6.3.4. Whenever possible, mishap reports will be created using the Air Force Safety
   Automated System (AFSAS).
       6.3.5. Consider human factors from both individual human performance, supervisory,
       and organizational influences.
6.4. Preliminary Message.
   6.4.1. Only the first electronically transmitted safety message advising of a mishap is titled
   Preliminary Report. (NOTE: OPREP-3 Reports do not satisfy this requirement.) For Class A
   and B on-duty mishaps, send a fully releasable preliminary report within 8 hours (Table 6.1).
   6.4.2. Include purely factual information only. Ensure no privileged safety information is
   included (nothing based on witness testimony, board analysis, etc.).
 22                                                       AFMAN91-221 8 NOVEMBER 2010


   6.4.3. Send through AFSAS. When AFSAS is not available, use commercial facilities to
   send basic mishap data and follow up with a copy by first class mail.
   6.4.4. Include a narrative description of what happened (but not why), stating the best and
   most complete information available in simple and direct terms. Do not delay the report for
   lack of information. If complete data is not available, provide it in a status report.
6.5. Status Message:
   6.5.1. Follow guidance in AFI 91-204. Additionally, an initial status message must be sent
   within 10 days for Class A and B on-duty mishaps (Table 6.1). The purpose is to relay new
   information discovered since the preliminary message and to identify the investigating
   officer (by name, grade, organization, and position).
   6.5.2. Status messages may be sent at any time to update information prior to final reports
   when awaiting results from deficiency reports, analyses, TOX tests, etc. The purpose is to
   relay the status of the mishap investigation and any new information discovered since the
   initial status report. Findings, causes, and recommendations may be made in a status report, if
   a delay is anticipated in receiving results, but the investigator believes that enough
   information is available to reach a conclusion. In this case, issue a status report no later than
   30 days after the mishap with as much information as is known. Publish a final report when
   the results are known and revise the status report’s findings, causes, and recommendations, if
   required.
   6.5.3. If new information is found and the information makes significant changes to the final
   message, send a message updating findings, causes, or recommendations.
6.6. Final Message. Follow guidance in AFI 91-204. Additionally:
   6.6.1. Use the message format, except as noted.
   6.6.2. Complete the investigation and prepare the final message within the specified time
   limits. The convening authority will release the final message, unless this responsibility is
   delegated to the SIB or single investigator.
   6.6.3. The principles for writing the narrative portion of the final report are the same as for
   the formal report below.
6.7. High Accident Potential (HAP) Reports.
   6.7.1. HAP reports provide information on events and trends that did not cause damage,
   injury, or death, but have the potential to do so. HAP reports are Class E events that do not
   have a dollar cost.
   6.7.2. If a HAP event involves materiel failure, malfunction, or design deficiency, the single
   manager forwards corrective action taken or contemplated to AFSC/SEW, AFMC/SE, and
   the investigating MAJCOM by message within 60 days following the date of the associated
   deficiency report or combined mishap deficiency report. Replies to deficiency reports by the
   agency with engineering responsibility suffice for the ALC action message if the HAP’s
   mishap event number is included.
AFMAN91-221 8 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                      23


6.8. Formal Reports.
   6.8.1. All privileged safety formal reports have two parts: Part 1, Factual Information &
   Releasable Exhibits, and Part 2, Board Conclusions & Protected Exhibits. Follow-up actions
   will be placed in supplemental Status Messages as required by para 6.5.2.
   6.8.2. Authenticating Formal Reports. Type each primary SIB member’s name, grade, and
   position on the last page of the tab containing board analysis and conclusions. Have each
   concurring member, including primary members from other services on Joint Investigations,
   sign above it for authentication of the report or for any changes to the report. If the formal
   SIB report needs to be changed after it is completed and signed by the board, all primary
   members of the SIB shall be physically reconvened.
   6.8.3. Controlling the Formal Report. Once the SIB completes the investigation and finalizes
   the hard copy report, the SIB will send all copies of the formal report to the convening
   authority. The convening authority safety office will control all hard copies of the report until
   the convening authority is briefed on the results of the investigation. Upon approval for
   release, the MAJCOM safety office will control the distribution of the report. MAJCOMs
   may set up different procedures to speed up the distribution process. Publish these procedures
   in the MAJCOM Supplement.
   6.8.4. Forwarding Formal Reports.
      6.8.4.1. The memorandum of transmittal (Figure A1.1) will list all addressees receiving
      copies of (or extracts from or attachments to) the report. Number and account for all
      copies of privileged reports by listing each addressee, including office symbol and copy
      number, in the “Distribution List” attachment to the memorandum of transmittal (for
      example, ACC/SE, Harbor Center, 2 Eaton Street, Suite 402, Hampton VA 23669, copy 4
      of 20). The memorandum of transmittal goes before all Tabs in Part 1 of the report.
      Include a statement signed by the SIB president, certifying the number of copies of the
      report listed are the only copies of the SIB report produced.
      6.8.4.2. Distribution of privileged reports is restricted to those with a need to know in the
      Air Force or Unified Commands. Do not provide copies or extracts to agencies outside
      the Air Force. If an agency outside the Air Force needs a copy of the formal report for
      corrective actions or has statutory jurisdiction, request authorization from AFSC/JA by
      message or memorandum before sending copies to these organizations.
      6.8.4.3. AFSC or MAJCOMs may require additional copies to be sent to their
      headquarters to aid in staffing the report. After completing the command endorsement,
      MAJCOMs must destroy all but the file copy.
      6.8.4.4. Send copies of the formal report to all Air Force agencies or organizations
      tasked in the recommendations. If investigators conclude action needs to be taken by an
      agency outside the convening authority’s command, but cannot specifically identify
      where it must be accomplished, the convening authority’s safety office will:
          6.8.4.4.1. Locate the responsible agency and provide the investigating officer with a
          point of contact, or
          6.8.4.4.2. Accept initial responsibility for the action by being tasked as OPR in the
          formal report. In this case, the convening authority’s safety office should ensure an
 24                                                     AFMAN91-221 8 NOVEMBER 2010


          extra copy of the formal report is prepared and available for forwarding when the
          appropriate action agency and point of contact are determined.
      6.8.4.5. If a Secretariat level or Air Staff office is the action agency for a validated
      recommendation, the MAJCOM safety office will forward a copy of the report that
      agency and in informational copy to AF/SEI. MAJCOM safety offices will also forward
      reports directly to Forward Operating Units (FOAs) or Direct Reporting Units (DRUs).
      6.8.4.6. AFSC may request extra copies of reports for distribution to other agencies.
      Send these copies to AFSC/JA, who will provide them to the proper agency.
      6.8.4.7. Do not produce “information only” copies of formal reports.
      6.8.4.8. The SIB president may keep a complete copy of the formal report (for briefing
      purposes) for 60 days. List this copy on the memorandum of transmittal and return it to
      the MAJCOM safety office for disposition.
      6.8.4.9. Wing-level units or below destroy formal reports upon receipt of the
      Memorandum of Final Evaluation (MOFE) or Letter of Administrative Closure (LOAC).
      Numbered Air Forces and above destroy formal reports upon final close-out of
      recommendations and when no longer needed for mishap prevention purposes. The
      convening authority may retain reports according to AFI 33-364. AFSC/JA must approve
      retention of these reports for other than the convening authority.
6.9. Contents of the Narrative. See AFI 91-204 for information on documenting the
investigation.
6.10. Preparing Formal Mishap Reports:
   6.10.1. Prepare formal reports according to this instruction and AFI 91-204, use continuation
   pages, if needed.
   6.10.2. Prepare the report using the title “(TYPE) Accident/Incident Report.” Paper copies
   will be placed in 3-ring binder on plain, 8.5 by 11 inch white paper, printed on both sides.
   Provide an adequate level of detail by including or condensing all information provided in
   message. Where appropriate, include the photographs referenced in message. Refer to Table
   6.3 for addressees for non-nuclear events. For nuclear events, use Table 6.4
   6.10.3. Air Force mishap messages are subject to limited distribution. Moreover, safety
   reports that include confidential witness statements, findings, conclusions, causes,
   recommendations, analysis or the deliberations of the SIB or single investigating officer are
   privileged. Ensure reports are marked with appropriate warnings in accordance with AFI 91-
   204.
   6.10.4. EXCEPTION: Preliminary mishap messages (“8-hour” reports) are factual only, not
   privileged, and fully releasable, unless controlled for other reasons, such as information
   security.
      6.10.4.1. For classified messages, add the proper security classification marking from
      AFI 31-401, and omit the notation “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.”
      6.10.4.2. Special Markings. Do not stamp unclassified pages in Part 1 that have no
      privileged information with markings indicating special handling requirements or
AFMAN91-221 8 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                   25


     identifying them as “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.” Ensure all documents are marked in
     accordance with AFI 91-204.
6.11. PART 1—FACTUAL INFORMATION & RELEASABLE MATERIAL:
  6.11.1. TAB A: Distribution Letter and Safety Investigator Information. Include one copy of
  the orders appointing the SIB (or investigating officer). The orders must contain the full
  name, rank/ grade, SSAN, organization, and complete official mailing address for each
  appointed person.
  6.11.2. TAB B: USAF Mishap Report (AF Form 711-series)
     6.11.2.1. Submit AF Form 711D, Nuclear Mishap/Incident Report, included in AFI 91-
     204, with formal nuclear mishap reports involving nuclear weapon reportable mishaps, if
     nuclear material is involved. Submit with nuclear reactor system or radiological safety
     reports involving nuclear reactor system or radiological accidents, incidents, and mishaps
     if nuclear power systems, radioactive material, or radioactive sources are involved. See
     AFI 91-204 for completing AF Form 711D.
     6.11.2.2. Submit AF Form 711B, USAF Mishap Report, on each guided missile,
     explosive and chemical agent, and directed energy mishap requiring a formal report.
     Place the form in Part 1 of the report.
  6.11.3. TAB C: Preliminary Message Report. Place the fully releasable preliminary report in
  Tab C.
  6.11.4. TAB D: Maintenance Reports, Records, and Data. Place any maintenance data
  pertaining to the weapon, explosive, or radiological material involved.
  6.11.5. TAB E: Not used.
  6.11.6. TAB F:     Weather and Environmental Records and Data. Use, if contributed to
  mishap.
  6.11.7. TAB G: Personnel Records. Use for maintenance personnel and training records,
  QA reports, and evaluations.
  6.11.8. TAB H: Egress, Impact, and Crashworthiness Analysis. N/A.
  6.11.9. TAB I: Deficiency Reports. Include all Product Quality Deficiency Reports (PQDR)
  submitted in conjunction with the mishap investigation. Include a copy of the submitted
  PQDR report containing the following information: Report Control Number (RCN),
  Cognizant Official, name of part (nomenclature), and part number.
  6.11.10. TAB J: Releasable Technical Reports and Engineering Evaluations. If DoD
  personnel provided written reports, include them here. Do not provide a promise of
  confidentiality to DoD personnel. Include on-scene evaluations submitted by DoD personnel
  in this tab. Factual reports or information provided by a contractor, which the contractor’s
  representative has determined does not require the promise of confidentiality, are placed in
  Tab R, followed by a memorandum of acknowledgment. Joint ALC and contractor factual
  reports should also be placed in Tab R. Any analysis referring to privileged information (e.g.,
  witness testimony, board conclusions, etc.) should be included in an addendum and placed in
  Tab T.
26                                                         AFMAN91-221 8 NOVEMBER 2010


  6.11.11. TAB K: Mission Records and Data. Forms and work orders associated with mishap
  item.
     6.11.11.1. If private property is damaged, the Investigating Officer will draft a statement
     indicating the type of property damage involved (e.g., 20' x 30' x 15' deep crater in NW
     corner of property, 5 acres of grasslands destroyed, etc.) The statement will not contain
     damage cost estimates, but only describe the damage incurred. Additionally, do not state
     the cause of the property damage (e.g., 5 acres of grassland destroyed by post impact
     fire). Statement should be no more than a brief description of the type and extent of
     damage to civilian personnel and property.
  6.11.12. TAB L: Data from On-Board Recorders. N/A.
  6.11.13. TAB M: Data from Ground Radar and Other Sources. N/A.
  6.11.14. TAB N: Transcripts of Voice Communications. These are written transcripts of
  recorded voice communications, e.g., emergency response, 911 calls, etc. Because these
  transcripts are factual data, they often provide a basis for information in the factual summary
  of circumstances.
  6.11.15. TAB O: Any Additional Substantiating Data and Reports. This is supporting data
  not otherwise defined. It includes local operating instructions (OI), directives, non-privileged
  witness statements and other forms. If the SIB cites a brief document (such as a three-page
  local OI), place it within this Tab. Do not mark, highlight, or extract a particular page to
  show the SIB's exact area of interest. (Highlighted pages are placed at Tab T.) For lengthy
  documents, it is sufficient to show a listing of documents or records reviewed by the SIB and
  their effective dates. Films or videotapes depicting the actual mishap sequence or mishap
  scene, but not containing any privileged safety material that are part of the formal report,
  should be located within this Tab. List the tape or film on the index page and give the
  original to the AFI 51-503, Aerospace Accident Investigations (AAIB), or AFI 51-507
  Ground Accident Investigations Board (GAIB). Include any TCTOs or TOs in this Tab.
  However, if the publication is protected under the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22,
  U.S.C.Sec.2751 et seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (Title 50,
  U.S.C., App. 2401 et seq.), then contact the OPR to ascertain whether the material can be
  publicly released (i.e. Part 1). If not publicly releasable and still required for the report, place
  the information in Tab V or W, as required. Regardless, the publication may be released to
  the AIB or GAIB, if any.
  6.11.16. TAB P: Damage & Injury Summaries. This lists the total damage to all government
  property, materiel, and equipment. Provide a detailed statement that includes acquisition,
  replacement or repair costs (as applicable) for all property, material or equipment damaged.
  Include nomenclature and national stock number (NSN), if available. Noting the exact cost of
  nuclear equipment or devices may classify the report.
  6.11.17. TAB Q: AIB or AFI 51-507, Ground Accident Investigation Board, if any,
  Transfer Documents.
  6.11.18. TAB R: Releasable Witness Testimony.
     6.11.18.1. Memorandum for Non-Privileged Written Witness Statements: Refer to
     Figure 6.7.
AFMAN91-221 8 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                  27


     6.11.18.2. Transcripts of complete interviews must contain this advisory. In cases where
     witness testimony is summarized by the interviewer, it must be clear that the witness was
     advised of and understood this advisory. Where a promise of confidentiality has been
     extended, AFI 91-204 provides a sample witness statement format for use with witness
     statements.
     6.11.18.3. Select only meaningful statements and testimony to include in this tab. It is
     not necessary to publish every statement taken from every individual interviewed. Place
     the statements and testimony of each individual together in chronological order with the
     earliest on top to make it easier to compare the individual’s impressions.
     6.11.18.4. Guided missile, directed energy weapon, and nuclear weapon investigations
     are authorized to offer promises of confidentiality to witnesses. A “Promise of
     Confidentiality” is not authorized for testimony made during explosives or weapons
     mishaps. Explosive or weapons mishap investigations other than nuclear weapon, guided
     missile, or directed energy must ask AF/SE for permission before making a promise of
     confidentiality. If a witness or involved contractor will not provide a statement without a
     promise of confidentiality, contact AFSC/SE for special approval to grant confidentiality
     to witnesses. See AFI 91-204 for further discussion on confidentiality and privileged
     witness statements.
  6.11.19. TAB S: Releasable Photographs, Videos and Diagrams. Ensure diagrams are self-
  explanatory. Include only those diagrams that add to the report such as wreckage patterns or
  impact areas. Indicate direction with a northward pointing arrow on each diagram. If
  practical, indicate scale. Ensure the diagrams do not depict the location of human remains.
  Such diagrams should be placed in Part 2, Tab U, to protect the privacy interests of the
  decedent’s family.
6.12. PART 2—CONCLUSIONS AND NON-RELEASABLE MATERIAL:
  6.12.1. TAB T: Investigation Analysis & Conclusions. This is the most important part of the
  report. It draws on all portions of the report to provide a complete picture of what happened.
  It is a thorough analysis of all evidence and the findings, causes, and recommendations. This
  section records the opinions of the SIB, and it either accepts or rejects all scenarios or
  theories in the report. Only in the case of a minority report are there differing findings,
  causes, or recommendations. Life sciences "human factors" recommendations related to
  causal findings will be included with the other SIB recommendations. Place all privileged
  status messages and the final CMR in this Tab. The layout should be as follows:
     6.12.1.1. Executive Summary - Provide a condensed version of the mishap report that
     encapsulates the mishap sequence, analysis, and board’s primary findings, causes and
     recommendations. (This should be two or three pages in length.)
     6.12.1.2. Mishap Sequence.
     6.12.1.3. Investigation and Analysis.
     6.12.1.4. Report Authentication & Minority Reports. Type each primary SIB member’s
     name, grade, and position on the last page of the tab containing board analysis and
     conclusions. Have each concurring member, including primary members from other
     services on Joint Investigations, sign above it for authentication of the report or for any
28                                                       AFMAN91-221 8 NOVEMBER 2010


     changes to the report. If the formal SIB report needs to be changed after it is completed
     and signed by the board, all primary members of the SIB shall be physically reconvened.
  6.12.2. TAB U: Witness Testimony Provided Under a Promise of Confidentiality.
  Investigators take statements from all individuals involved in the mishap or who were
  eyewitnesses to it. A promise of confidentiality may be given to any witness whom the SIB
  determines should be extended such a promise for mishaps involving nuclear or directed
  energy weapons. A promise of confidentiality shall not be given on a blanket basis to every
  potential witness. The promise of confidentiality must be clearly understood by those
  witnesses extended the promise, and they must be given the opportunity to waive any
  confidentiality. Non-privileged statements will be placed in Tab O. Investigators must read
  the following Promise of Confidentiality advisory (Contained in AFI 91-204) to each
  witness, and must read it onto all tape recordings of interviews.
  6.12.3. TAB V: Other Supporting Privileged Products.
  6.12.4. TAB W: Technical Reports and Engineering Evaluations Provided Under a Promise
  of Confidentiality. If a contractor who built, designed, or maintained the equipment provides
  an engineering analysis under a promise of confidentiality, include the evaluation in this tab.
  If possible, include a factual summary in Tab R. Also include memorandums of
  acknowledgment on protection of privileged safety data signed by these contractors when
  their evaluations are included in privileged formal reports.
  6.12.5. TAB X: Privileged Photographs, Videos and Diagrams. Well-defined photos help in
  mishap analysis. Use them to show damage, impact areas, metal fractures, flight path, vehicle
  travel, etc. Only include photographs aiding in understanding the mishap, and reference them
  in the analysis at Tab W. Use of scanned or color copies for reproduction in the formal report
  is preferred over pasting of actual photographs. Do not include photographs of deceased
  personnel in the safety report. Place an index of photographs at Tab X to aid reviewers. Do
  not refer to privileged safety information on the page captions or in comments on the index.
  Staged photographs are placed at Tab T near the related narrative. For example, include
  pictures of models showing flight paths in a midair collision at Tab T. Pointing with a finger
  or other device at a portion of wreckage does not make the photograph staged. Assembling or
  reconstructing damaged parts or aligning parts to show fire patterns or impact marks are
  examples of staged photographs. Depictions of cockpit indications for a given set of
  assumptions made by the SIB or described in witness testimony are staged photographs.
  When investigators include privileged safety information on a transparent overlay, place the
  photograph with the overlay in Tab T and the photograph without the overlay in Tab S. Hold
  all photographs and videotapes taken by the SIB, except those staged for analysis, for use by
  the AIB or GAIB. Place films or videotapes depicting the actual mishap sequence and
  containing privileged safety material that are part of the formal report with this tab. List the
  mishap tape or film on the index page. Video or computer animations or reenactments of a
  mishap prepared for or by the SIB are part of the SIB's analysis of the mishap. Reference
  these video simulations or reenactments on the Tab W index page and include the video
  simulation with the copy of the report sent to AFSC/CC. All other copies of the video
  simulation should be destroyed when no longer needed by the SIB for analysis or briefing.
  AF/SE may authorize use of these SIB video simulations for mishap prevention purposes.
AFMAN91-221 8 NOVEMBER 2010                                                                    29


     6.12.5.1. Whenever findings or recommendations involve deficiencies in, or changes to,
     technical orders, flight manuals, checklists, or directives, include applicable portions of
     the original publications in this tab. The SIB's conclusion that a particular paragraph of a
     document was or was not a mishap factor is privileged. Place highlighted pages or
     publication extracts revealing the deliberative process of the board in Tab T. Include
     copies of submitted AFTO Form 22, Technical Manual (TM) Change Recommendation
     and Reply, or AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, as attachments
     to Tab T.
  6.12.6. TAB Y: Life Sciences and Medical Reports. Narrative descriptions of human factors
  and portions of the Life Sciences and Medical Reports are in Tab T. However, a more
  detailed narrative using extensive medical terminology appears in Tab Y. The medical
  officer is responsible for the completion of this Tab. Tab Y is organized in three sections.
  Section One is the bulk of the SIB’s analyses. As such, it is privileged information. It is
  releasable to all those authorized a copy of the report. Section Two contains 72-hour and 14-
  day histories. Section Three contains protected medical information that is not necessarily
  privileged. It is releasable to the AIB and is included only in the copy of the report that goes
  to the AFSC. The following topics should be discussed.
     6.12.6.1. Section One, Privileged Information
         6.12.6.1.1. Life Science Narrative. This narrative provides context for the life
         sciences factors and non-factors discussed later in the report. It will differ from the
         narrative in Tab T in detail only. Operational details are included to the extent
         necessary to describe life sciences variables. Extensive detail (including medical and
         human factors terminology) is included on medical issues, human performance,
         personal protective equipment, and procedures. As with the narrative in Tab T, begin
         the narrative as early in the mishap sequence as is relevant and stop the narrative
         when all injury and damage is described.
         6.12.6.1.2. Investigation and Analysis of Life Science Factors. Include a discussion
         of “Organizational Influences, Supervision, Preconditions and Acts of Individuals”
         from the latest version of DoD HFACS (Human Factors Analysis and Classification
         System) (reference AFI 91-204, Attachment 5). Also include Rescue variables that
         contributed to the mishap outcome.
         6.12.6.1.3. Analysis of Non-factors Worthy of Discussion. Use this section to
         discuss those things discovered in the course of the investigation which had no effect
         on the current mishap, but have a potential to contribute to a mishap in the future.
         “Typically, do not write a Non Factor Worthy of Discussion for any issue for which
         the SIB will not have an Other Finding of Significance and an Other
         Recommendation of Significance in Tab T”.
         6.12.6.1.4. Discussion of Non-factors. Use this section to discuss those things
         extensively investigated, but which the SIB has determined did not contribute to the
         mishap. Such a detailed discussion of a non-factor is usually done when one expects
         questions about a variable you ruled out as important.
         6.12.6.1.5. Life Science Member/Consultant Reports. When available, place all
         human factors, aerospace physiology, aviation psychology, life support equipment,
 30                                                     AFMAN91-221 8 NOVEMBER 2010


          and other consultant reports here. Remember, unlike the bulk of the Tab Y, the
          consultant report only speaks for the consultants’ point of view. If a consultant was
          assigned to the board, the consultant must submit a written report, and the report must
          be included in Tab Y, even if the consultant report does not agree with the SIB
          findings. If the board chooses to discount or disagree with a significant portion of a
          consultant report this fact may be annotated in the appropriate “Investigation and
          Analysis” section.
      6.12.6.2. Section Two, 72-hour and 14-day Histories. 72-hour and 14-day histories may
      be either privileged or non-privileged. Ensure to obtain, and include either the privileged
      or non-privileged witness statements.
      6.12.6.3. Section Three, Non-privileged Protected Medical Information. This section is
      non-privileged information and is given to the AIB. It is included only in Copy 1, which
      is sent to the AFSC. Simply delete Section Three from all other copies of the final report.
      For the Toxicology reports and medical forms, simply scan and paste in the required
      documentation.
          6.12.6.3.1. Toxicology Reports.     Scan and paste in the reports from relevant
          toxicology tests.
          6.12.6.3.2. Physical Examinations And Medical Condition. Include scanned copies
          of the DD Form 2808, Report of Medical Examination; DD Form 2807-1, Report of
          Medical History; the most recent Physical Health Assessment, the SF 2766; any
          active waivers; and the person’s current profile.
          6.12.6.3.3. Post Mishap Physical Or Autopsy Report. The factual post-mishap
          physicals should be documented on DD Form 2808 or SF 506 and included here.
          Include a summary of injuries (but do not include a detailed discussion of the
          sources/mechanisms of injury – that should appear in the narrative in Section One).
          Also include factual radiology reports and statements of prognosis and prescribed
          medications.
   6.12.7. TAB Z: Investigation Final Products
6.13. Supplement. Follow-up Actions. This part is applicable for only the Convening
Authority’s copy and the AFSC copy one of the formal report.
   6.13.1. Tab 1. Statements of Persons Cited in Findings. Place the original and endorsed
   notification memorandums and any statements provided by persons found causal in a
   privileged safety investigation at this tab.
   6.13.2. Tab 2. Comments to Final Message/Formal Report. Insert copies of required
   comments.
   6.13.3. Tab 3. Memorandum of Final Evaluation (MOFE).
   6.13.4. Tab 4. Investigation Reports from Other Organizations (NTSB, National
   Transportation Safety Board), Law Enforcement, Foreign or other military services). Place
   applicable copies of any available reports that may assist personnel reviewing this mishap at
   a later date.

2. Overseas commands use IMMEDIATE precedence.

3. Use Figure A3.1. format for initial status report. Include new information discovered since
the preliminary report and identify SIB members. Remember to place the safety privilege
statement at the beginning of the message. Include the “For Official Use Only” statement unless
classified—then, use classification markings.

4. For subsequent reports, include information not previously reported in the initial status or
preliminary report. It is not necessary to use the entire Figure A3.1. format for subsequent status
reports. Only add information not previously reported. Use the Figure A3.1. format when
modifying a previously transmitted message or final report.

5. If the investigation will not be complete within the time frame, transmit a 30-day status
message on day 30 and every 30 days until the investigation is complete. Include estimated date
of investigation completion. For extension of due date, send request to the investigating
MAJCOM/DRU/FOA with information copy to AFSC/SEW.

6. Do not delay final reports awaiting testing results. If the results from testing significantly
change the outcome of final report, reconvene the SIB (if necessary) and send a status report
describing the changes. For extension of due date, send request to the investigating
MAJCOM/DRU/FOA with information copy to AFSC/SEW.

Terms
AIR RESERVE COMPONENTS (ARC)—All units, organizations, and members of the ANG
and AFRC (10 U.S.C. 261) on active duty, on active duty for training, or in drill status, and ANG
and AFRC technicians; include ANG and AFRC property and equipment. Military status starts
upon beginning duty for military pay and ends when duty stops. All references to Air Force
military personnel and property also apply to ARC military personnel and property.
AIRCRAFT FLIGHT MISHAP—Any mishap in which there is intent for flight and reportable
damage to a DOD aircraft. Explosives and chemical agents or guided missile mishaps that cause
damage in excess of $20,000 to a DOD aircraft with intent for flight are categorized as aircraft
flight mishaps to avoid dual reporting. This is the only aviation mishap subcategory that
contributes to the flight mishap rate.
BEELINE FADED GIANT—A nuclear reactor system or radiological incident as defined by
the criteria in paragraph 1.4.7
BENT SPEAR—A reporting flagword identifying a nuclear weapon system incident. This
includes mishaps not in the accident category but meeting any of the criteria in paragraph 1.4.4
BROKEN ARROW—A reporting flagword that identifies a nuclear weapon accident that could
NOT create the risk of war, but meets the following criteria: nuclear detonation of a nuclear
weapon; nonnuclear detonation (no nuclear yield) or burning of a nuclear weapon, nuclear
warhead, or nuclear component; radioactive contamination from a nuclear weapon or nuclear
component; jettison of a nuclear weapon or nuclear component; public hazard (actual or
perceived) from a nuclear weapon, nuclear warhead, or nuclear component.
CATASTROPHIC—Occurs when the entire system or a major portion of it is inoperative. For
example failure of the annunciation and display subsystem.
CAUSAL FINDING—Causal findings are those, which, singly or in combination with other
