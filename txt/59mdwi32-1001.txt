This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 32-10, Installations and Facilities. This
Medical Wing Instruction (MDWI) establishes the procedures and provides information to be
followed in the event of a scheduled or emergency utility outage or utility failure at building
4550, Wilford Hall Medical Center. A utility outage or failure is a major loss of a utility
affecting a large section of the building. The utilities affected may include electricity, water,
sewer drainage, natural gas, medical air, oxygen, vacuum, chilled water or steam. This
instruction applies to all personnel assigned, attached, or on contract to the 59 Medical Wing
(MDW). This instruction does not apply to the Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. Ensure that
all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordance with Air Force Records Information Management System Records Disposition
Schedule located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change revises 59 MDWI 32-1001 by updating facility name and contact phone
numbers.
1. Utility System General Information.
   1.1. Normal power for building 4550 is supplied by the Total Energy Plant (TEP) located in
   building 4895. The TEPs primary generators and supplemental City Public Service electrical
 2                                                        59THMDWI32-1001 31 AUGUST 2011


     service meet the daily electrical power requirements for Wilford Hall Medical Center and is
     available through all normal (white) and emergency (red) plugs.
     1.2. Emergency Power (also called “Red Power”), is provided by the standby emergency
     generators located in building 4550 by the dining facility. Emergency Power generation is
     activated and supplied only as a result of significant normal power electrical system failure or
     through deliberately planned outages. The emergency power distribution system is designed
     to meet the electrical support requirements for critical patient areas and life safety systems. It
     is distributed throughout Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center through the red power
     outlets.
     1.3. Under nominal power conditions, all normal and red power outlets plus lighting systems
     are supplied with electrical power.
     1.4. During electrical system failures, scheduled outages, or emergency situations, only red
     outlets and selected overhead lighting are energized. Depending on the extent of scheduled
     outages, some patient care areas may have normal power, while other areas may have red
     power only.
     1.5. Transfer from normal power to “red power” requires a momentary interruption during
     automatic transfer switch activation. The electrical system is designed to transfer power in
     ten (10) seconds or less during system failures or emergencies. During the ten second period,
     there will be no power at any outlet or light system. For scheduled outages, since emergency
     generators are started in advance, only a momentary “blip” will occur during transfer to red
     power.
     1.6. Medical air, vacuum systems, alarm systems, exit route illumination, emergency
     communication systems, exits signs, select elevators, and all red outlets will remain
     operational during electrical system failures and scheduled outages.
     1.7. Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, exhaust fans for isolation
     rooms are not operational during the initial phases of an electrical system failure or
     emergency. Select HVAC systems that provide air conditioning to the Urgent Care Clinic.
     For scheduled outage, free standing cooling units or spot coolers can be provided to other
     select general patient care areas.
     1.8. Elevator service will be limited during a large scale building 4550 electrical failure or
     scheduled power outage. Generally, one passenger elevator in each bank will be transferred
     to red power and become operational. This typically includes:
        1.8.1. One elevator from passenger elevator bank 1, 2, 3, and 4.
        1.8.2. One elevator from freight elevator bank 5 and 6.
        1.8.3. One elevator from passenger elevator bank 7, 8, 9, and 10.
        1.8.4. One elevator from surgical elevator bank 11, 12, and 13.
        1.8.5. The emergency elevator, 17.
Note: Passenger elevators 14 and 15, Magnetic Resonance Imaging elevator 16, and cart lifts
are not operational during electrical outages.

       2.1.2.2. Submit a notice to Public Affairs not later than seven days prior to the
       scheduled outage for publication in the Medical Center Bulletin, Vital Signs, and/or
       through 59 MDW group commanders for outages affecting the entire medical center.
           2.1.2.3. If required, arrange and conduct pre-outage meetings with affected medical
           functions or clinics to discuss systems affected during the outage and mitigation
           action to be taken to continue functioning during the time of the outage.
       2.1.3. Affected 59 MDW functions shall:
           2.1.3.1. Notify their affected subordinate sections of the scheduled outage and
           resolve any scheduling conflicts with 502d/CEW and 59 MLRS/SGSKF. Each will
           immediately notify 502d/CEW (292-7377) during normal duty hours, or
 4                                                       59THMDWI32-1001 31 AUGUST 2011


            502d/CEWIE (EMCS 292-5058) during non-duty hours, of any emergency situation
            that precludes the utility outage.
            2.1.3.2. Implement basic utility system outage response measures to mitigate impacts
