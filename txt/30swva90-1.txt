                                                  and Abuse Programs
   The primary charge of the Inspector General (IG) is to sustain a credible Air Force IG system by
ensuring the existence of responsive complaint investigations, and fraud, waste and abuse (FWA) programs
characterized by objectivity, integrity and impartiality. The IG ensures the concerns of all complainants,
and the best interests of the Air Force are addressed through objective fact-finding.

   The Inspector General Complaints Resolution program is described in AFI 90-301. This instruction tells
you how to submit a complaint, and who you should talk to. You may go to the Inspector General at any
level, but experience has shown that complaints can best be solved by commanders and supervisors. For
this reason, you are encouraged to discuss problems with your supervisor or your commander. No one may
act against you just because you complained. If you think someone has acted against you just because you
complained, tell an inspector or an IG.
