SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: FCF/ACF/OCF/HSTC checklist addition, changes to the Aircraft Maintenance Unit
(AMU) Responsibilities and FCF completion.
1. Functional Check Flight (FCF). FCFs, Operational Check Flights (OCF), Acceptance
Check Flights (ACF) and High Speed Taxi Checks (HSTC) are performed to ensure aircraft are
safe for flight and capable of performing assigned missions. FCFs are not flown when the
airworthiness of the aircraft can be determined by maintenance operational checks prescribed by
associated technical directives.
2. Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMU) Responsibilities. Upon notification of a FCF, OCF,
ACF or HSTC, the owning aircraft maintenance unit will ensure the following steps are
completed:
     2.1. Place FCF/ACF/OCF/HSTC checklist in the front of the AFTO Form 781Aâ€™s,
     Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, and ensures all applicable items are
     completed.   Remove the checklist from the forms after the completion of the
     FCF/ACF/OCF/HSTC. (See Attachment 2 which is also located on the QA SharePoint site)
     2.2. Ensure all aircraft systems are fully operational or will not affect the FCF, OCF, ACF or
     HSTC profile.
     2.3. Refuel the aircraft as required in order to complete the FCF, OCF, ACF or HSTC
     profile.
     2.4. Configure the cargo compartment with a CP-2 rig. Only one 2-man seat at F.S. 267
     (right side) needs to be placed down and locked to the cargo compartment floor to
     accommodate the loadmaster.
     2.5. Prepare the aircraft AFTO Form 781 Series forms binder for review by Quality
     Assurance (QA) FCF Manager. Ensure all AFTO Form 781A pages of the original
     grounding discrepancies are included for the review process.
     2.6. The aircraft forms will be transcribed prior to flight, and maintenance will bring the
     transcribed forms and the active set of forms to the QA FCF Manager for the aircrew
     briefing.
     2.7. The 374th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (374 AMXS) Maintenance Operations
     Officer (MOO) (or designated representative) will notify the QA office as soon as possible,
     but not later than 1100, the day prior to the FCF mission requirement, and coordinate with
     the applicable flying squadron to schedule a FCF-qualified aircrew for the mission.
3. QA FCF Manager Responsibilities. Upon notification of an FCF, ACF or OCF, the FCF
Manager will ensure the following steps are completed:
     3.1. Prepare a FCF Worksheet (a blue-lined AFTO Form 781A, page 1A) for inclusion in the
     aircraft forms. If there is more than one FCF on the same day, use the following job control
     numbers: 5001-5026.
374AWI21-118 19 APRIL 2012                                                                  3


   3.2. Review the aircraft forms for maintenance accuracy and completed documentation.
   Retain the transcribed set of forms until the FCF aircraft is released. Prepare a concise
   statement for the reason of the FCF to be entered in Block 1 of the FCF Worksheet.
   3.3. Prepare a T.O. 1C-130E(H)-6CL-1 and annotate the systems to be checked in Block 4,
   Reason for Check Flight. Consult the applicable maintenance specialist and highlight those
   areas on the checklist applicable to the FCF mission.
   3.4. On the day of the FCF; review the aircraft forms and verify status prior to the AMU
   calling the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) and Command Post to alert the aircrew.
   3.5. Insert the FCF Worksheet page 1A in front of page 1 of the AFTO Form 781A active
   forms and have the highlighted T.O. 1C-130E(H)-6CL-1 checklist ready for the aircrew
   briefing.
   3.6. When the aircrew arrives for the briefing, inform them of the reason for the FCF and
   annotate the action in the QA Database FCF Log. Ensure the aircrew is aware of any open
   discrepancies in the AFTO Form 781A active forms (e.g., in-flight operational checks, in-
   flight negative torque checks).
4. Aircrew Responsibilities. The FCF will be accomplished using the FCF Information File
containing: 374 AWI 21-118; T.O. 1-1-300-WA-1; T.O. 1C-130E(H)-6CF-1; and FCF Area
Map.
   4.1. The flight engineer will sign out the FCF Information File from the QA office (as
   required) for guidance in accomplishing the FCF requirements.
   4.2. Enter FCF-related discrepancies on the FCF Worksheet page 1A. Discrepancies not
   related to the FCF are placed in AFTO Form 781A active forms.
   4.3. The aircraft commander will annotate and complete the appropriate blocks on T.O. 1C-
   130E(H)-6CL-1, AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance, and
   FCF Worksheet with the local time and date the FCF is completed.
   4.4. The flight engineer will complete the highlighted checklist items, and items marked
   with an asterisk (*) symbol as required, by using a check mark for satisfactory, an (X) for
   unsatisfactory, or an (O) for not checked.
5. FCF Completion. Upon completion of the FCF, the QA FCF Manager will meet the FCF
aircrew at Maintenance Debrief Section and review the FCF checklist and aircraft forms to
determine if all requirements have been accomplished. The QA FCF Manager will accomplish
the following steps:
   5.1. Retrieve the FCF Worksheet, T.O. 1C-130E(H)-6CL-1 and the FCF Information
   Handbook from the aircrew.
   5.2. Deliver the FCF Worksheet, copy of all 781A maintenance discrepancies/corrective
   actions pertaining to the check flight, FCF/ACF/OCF/HSTC checklist, and T.O. 1C-
   130E(H)-6CL-1 to the 374th Maintenance Operations Squadron (374 MOS) Plans,
   Scheduling and Documentation (PS&D) Section to be included in the aircraft jacket file as a
   permanent record.
   5.3. If the aircraft fails the FCF and is not released, coordinate with the MOC, 374
   AMXS/MOO (or designated representative) and the respective flying squadron operations
4                                                               374AWI21-118 19 APRIL 2012


    desk to schedule the next flight attempt. A non-release is defined as a termination of the FCF
    sortie and the FCF aircrew returning to the Maintenance Debrief Section.
    5.4. Upon each FCF non-release, a new T.O. 1C-130E(H)-6CL-1 will be accomplished to
    account for the number of attempted FCF flights.
    5.5. When the FCF aircraft is released, the QA FCF Manager will complete all
    documentation in the QA Database FCF Log as required. This will serve as a permanent
    record as well as show deficiency or trend analysis.
