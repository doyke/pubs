This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive 11-2, Aircraft Rules and Procedures. It
establishes procedures for handling of aircraft transporting hazardous cargo. It applies to all units
associated with command and control, parking, maintenance, loading and off-loading, servicing
and guarding of these aircraft. This instruction establishes policies and procedures for
implementing Dover Air Force Base (DAFB) Form 22, Emergency Notification/Hazardous
Cargo, movement. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-
363), Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/. Refer recommended changes

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change revises DOVERAFBI 11-205 by (1) updating the reference to new explosive
site plan (paragraph 1), (2) correcting the reference to AFMAN 24-204 (paragraph 2), and (3)
Deleting Attachment 2 (Aircraft Parking Spot Explosive Weight Limits).

1. Hazardous Cargo On or Off-Loading and Parking Areas. Locations are identified in base
explosive site plan and on map D-8 which designates areas for on or off-loading and aircraft
parking for specific DOD Explosives Class Divisions and quantities of cargo. Use of these areas
depends on size and weight of aircraft, ramp condition and grounding. Map distributed by Wing
Weapons Safety Manager.
     1.1. Aircraft carrying explosive cargo, radioactive material, chemical agents, biological or
     etiological material will park on the appropriate spot designated by explosive site plan. If
     explosive hazard class cannot be determined before arrival, aircraft will park on the hot cargo
     pad spot 3 until such time as Command Post determines proper hazard class division.
     Aircraft will then park according to criteria in explosive site plan.
     1.2. Directives differ as to what constitutes hazardous cargo. For the purpose of this
     regulation, hazardous cargo is defined by AFMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials
     for Military Air Shipments. Aircraft placarding is IAW highest classification/division of
     hazardous cargo on board the aircraft.
