      Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear,
                   Biological, and Chemical Protection


                    Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Protection

     Chapter I discusses NBC protection challenges.

            Preattack, During-Attack, and Postattack Protective Actions

      Chapter II addresses actions that can be taken before, during, and after an NBC
attack. Because operations in an NBC environment can include TIM incidents, this chapter
also addresses suggested protective actions that can be taken in response to a TIM event.

                          Operations In Unique Environments

     Chapter III addresses how weather and terrain affect the need for NBC protection.
Certain weather conditions will greatly influence the use of NBC weapons. Likewise,
different types of terrain will alter the effects of NBC weapons.

                    Mission-Oriented Protective Posture Analysis

     Chapter IV addresses the guidance for determining the appropriate levels of
protection in an NBC environment.

    Sustained Operations in a Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Environment

      Chapter V provides insights into the degradation to be expected from enemy
employment of NBC weapons. The basic goals remain to avoid or minimize the impact of
the contamination and to enhance endurance and task performance. When individuals are
encapsulated in individual protective equipment (IPE), they are subjected to both
physiological and psychological stresses; however, given an understanding of the NBC
environment, its impact, and proper training, individuals can perform assigned tasks
successfully for a considerable period of time.

                                  Individual Protection

     Chapter VI provides an overview of the individual protection capabilities that are
available and/or issued to the armed forces of the US.

                                  Collective Protection

    Chapter VII addresses COLPRO planning considerations. It also discusses COLPRO
capabilities such as fixed-site, transportable, mobile, and Navy COLPRO systems.

                                         Chapter I

       NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, AND CHEMICAL PROTECTION


1.   Background

     This chapter discusses NBC protection fundamentals, protection planning, basic
considerations for protection of the force, NBC preparedness, and the components of NBC
protection.

2.   Basic Fundamentals

     There are several basic fundamentals that impact NBC protective actions. These
actions can include conducting intelligence preparation of the battlespace (IPB), providing
exposure guidance, conducting risk assessment, establishing protection requirements,
conducting protective actions, sustaining protective actions, providing supervision and
evaluation, ensuring warning and dewarning of personnel, and conducting medical
surveillance.

      a.    Conducting IPB. The IPB process must account for both confirmed as well as
plausible but unconfirmed adversary capabilities, plans, and actions. The commander uses
the IPB process to identify and answer priority intelligence requirements (PIRs). The IPB
allows the commander to visualize the area of operation (AO) and discern the adversary’s
probable intent. The commander must take into account the potential adversary’s NBC
capabilities in assessments, estimates, and plans. The NBC staff uses the IPB process (in
coordination with the medical and intelligence sections) and addresses the capabilities and
limitations of the adversary’s NBC weapons and delivery systems; the procedures for
command, control, and release; the indicators of intent to employ NBC weapons; and the
identification of possible TIM in AOs. The NBC staff must understand the adversary’s
intent, weapons capabilities, and weapons effects. The adversary may use weapons
systems that range from artillery or rockets to theater ballistic missiles (TBMs). Delivery
tactics could include overt or covert means (e.g., special operations forces [SOF]), state
sponsored terrorism, or other asymmetric methods.

      b.    Providing Exposure Guidance. Exposure to NBC warfare agents or TIM may
occur through inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, or other percutaneous exposure. Such
exposure may have significant, immediate, or prolonged health effects. Therefore, the goal
is to keep the exposure as low as reasonably achievable. The commander will ensure that
military personnel, Department of Defense (DOD) essential civilians, contractors, and other
essential personnel who support US military operations use appropriate protective
equipment when operating near any detectable NBC agents or TIM, operating where
agents are suspected, or participating in decontamination operations. Exposure to NBC
agents or accidental release of TIM may adversely impact mission performance and result
in disease or nonbattle injuries. As such, risk exposure must be assessed and integrated
into overall military operational risk management. Typical scenarios for potential exposure
to agents could include—


                                                                                          I-1
           •   Downwind hazard from the enemy’s attack.

           •   Collateral damage from the enemy’s NBC or TIM storage facilities or
               transportation systems.

           •   Vapor off-gassing from material or surfaces in previously contaminated
               areas.

           •   Contamination at unit locations from an enemy NBC attack.

           •   Contact hazard from an enemy NBC attack.

           (1) The medical preventive medicine (PVNTMED) and NBC planners provide
essential staff support to the commander on the hazard from TIM and NBC warfare agents.
The PVNTMED planners carefully analyze the medical threat and evaluate the
environmental and occupational health risks in the AO. The NBC planners assess the NBC
threat. Both planners then coordinate with the unit’s intelligence section. After
coordination, the NBC planners recommend protective actions to the commander.

           (2) The exposure guidance furnished will depend on factors that include
sensitivity of exposed individuals, the potential exposure durations, potential agent
concentrations, and the potential combinations of agents to which individuals may be
exposed.

            (3) The sensitivity of individuals and the exposure duration affect the severity
and characteristics of toxic effects that may be experienced by exposed individuals. A short
exposure to an NBC agent or TIM may produce only minimal adverse effects, such as mild
irritation, whereas longer exposure may produce more severe effects, which could interfere
with mission function or result in death. The first indication of exposure to NBC agents or
TIM will likely be noticeable symptoms.

          (4) Exposure frequency and concentration are often critical factors in
estimating the severity and onset of casualty-producing effects from exposure. Exposure
frequency describes how often individual exposures have occurred during a specific time
period. This is important because the human body does not detoxify agents in a timely
manner.

           (5) Additionally, increased physical workload in a deployed military population
may actually increase the probability of occurrence and the severity of casualty-producing
effects. Some factors, such as the breathing rate, increase as workload increases—leading
to an increased intake of NBC agents or TIM.

      c.   Conducting Risk Assessments.

           (1)  Vulnerabilities should be examined through comprehensive risk
assessments. Commanders have multiple means to contain, mitigate, and manage the
consequences of identified risks. In order to preserve combat power and minimize
casualties, commanders should—

                •   Identify potential health hazards.


I-2
                •   Assess the probability of adverse health effects to determine risks.

                •   Develop controls and make risk decisions.

                •   Implement controls.

                •   Supervise operations and evaluate the situation.

           (2) When US, host nation (HN), or other civilian populations or infrastructures
are at risk to an NBC attack, the commander assists the appropriate military and civil
authorities to protect against, mitigate, and manage the consequences of these risks.

            (3) Risk assessment also addresses the hazards posed by TIM, as well as
negligible exposure to NBC agents, including radiological and other environmental
contamination. Negligible levels are defined as below detectable levels of currently fielded
chemical agent point detectors. Because standard military NBC individual protective
equipment (IPE) does not always provide necessary protection, the assessment of the
possible presence of TIM within the AO must be part of the IPB information collection
process. Particular care must be taken in identifying the nature of such hazards. In some
instances, avoiding the hazard may be the most effective or only course of action (COA). In
all circumstances, the unit should act to minimize the immediate and long-term effects of
toxic hazards to health by exposing the smallest number of personnel for the shortest
period of time.

          (4) Control measures can be taken to eliminate or minimize exposure over a
wide range of actions. Example control measures could include representative measures
such as—

                •   Ensuring predeployment vaccination and prophylaxis.

                •   Moving operations (e.g., relocating a base camp).

                •   Managing work schedules and limiting shift duration.

                •   Managing personnel rotation on high-risk missions.

                •   Monitoring and conducting surveillance of potential threat risks.

                •   Ensuring understanding and exercising of unmasking procedures.

               • Briefing commanders and service personnel on potential threats and
safe and appropriate responses.

                •   Enforcing the correct wear of uniforms.

                •   Enforcing health and hygiene standards.

                •   Isolating an operation by means of barriers or enclosures.




                                                                                           I-3
                 • Using pretreatments, prophylaxis, immunizations, and collective
protective shelters (CPSs).

                  •   Shielding a radiation source and/or using time and distance
considerations.

               • Conducting continuous medical surveillance and occupational and
environmental health surveillance.

                  •   Using mission-oriented protective posture (MOPP) gear.

                 • Monitoring weather conditions and considering the increase of
protective levels for forces during periods of high threat and weather conditions that are
favorable for the use of chemical and biological (CB) weapons.

     d.     Establishing Protection Requirements. Commanders direct the establishment of
coordinated NBC protection requirements through the preparation of NBC defense plans.
This kind of action is common across the various components and includes, but is not
limited to, dispersing and networking available detectors, designating NBC warning and
reporting requirements, implementing periodic sampling and analysis, and designating
shelters for applicable personnel. Other NBC defense protection requirements may
include—

            (1) Ensuring interoperability among components exercising important mission
tasks (e.g., warning and reporting).

          (2) Implementing the NBC defense plan as part of an integrated exercise and
adjusting plans as a result.

          (3) Using input from the theater missile defense (TMD) warning system to
ensure connectivity and the rapid dissemination of information.

           (4) Validating existing reach-back capability with regard to key elements, such
as sustaining the force’s capability to operate in an NBC environment (e.g., resupply of
NBC defense equipment and contracted logistics support [CLS] for critical, commercial, off-
the-shelf [COTS] NBC defense equipment).

           (5)    Evacuating suspect NBC samples for laboratory analysis, as required.

           (6)    Testing the warning and reporting system to warn or dewarn selected
units.

           (7)    Conducting waste-handling operations.

      e.   Conducting Protective Actions.

            (1) Leaders and staffs implement protective actions by ensuring that such
actions (e.g., directed MOPP level and dewarning) are integrated into standing operating
procedures (SOPs), written and verbal orders, mission briefings, and staff estimates. The
critical check for this step, with oversight, is to ensure that required actions (controls) are


I-4
converted into clear, simple execution orders. Implementing actions includes coordination
and communication with agencies such as higher, adjacent, and subordinate units and
those executing the mission.

         (2) Leaders also understand the impact of implementing protective actions.
Examples of implementation include—

                •   Conducting rehearsals and war-gaming possible COAs.

                •   Conducting local threat briefings.

                •   Conducting installation-specific NBC defense training for replacement
                    personnel.

                •   Installing and maintaining communications links for military and key
                    civilian organizations.

                •   Assessing personnel, operational, and logistics readiness.

                •   Carrying and maintaining IPE, prophylaxis, water, etc.

     f.    Sustaining Protective Actions. Leaders ensure that actions are taken to equip
and train US military and emergency-essential civilian personnel. Leaders may have to
plan for the protection of dependents and noncombatants, depending on the situation.
Deployable personnel are fitted with appropriate IPE, to include the protective mask.
Sustainment also ensures that adequate supplies (e.g., detection and decontamination kits,
mask filters, and medical provisions) are available and that required maintenance is
conducted.

     g.     Providing Supervision and Evaluation. During mission preparation and
execution, leaders conduct risk assessments to continuously evaluate and assess risk levels
that may yield lessons learned and/or identify new hazards. Leaders supervise mission
rehearsal and execution to ensure that standards and controls are maintained. Techniques
may include spot checks, inspections, situation reports (SITREPs) and brief backs, periodic
monitoring to minimize any exposure to NBC agents or TIM, buddy checks for heat stress,
and close supervision.

     h.   Ensuring Warning and Dewarning of Personnel. The NBC Warning and
Reporting System (NBCWRS) provides the data and information to inform leaders of
important information requirements. Key information requirements that can be derived
from NBCWRS include—

          (1)   Time and place of the attack.

          (2)   Who and what was affected.

          (3)   Impact of the attack.

          (4)   Specific type and extent of the hazard.



                                                                                            I-5
          (5)    Type of weapons and/or munitions employed.

     i.    Conducting Medical Surveillance. Before and during deployment, service
members are informed of significant health threats and corresponding medical prophylaxis,
immunization, and other unit and individual countermeasures for the AO. Additionally,
commanders ensure that deployment health surveillance and readiness documentation are
conducted according to applicable medical directives. For example, the documentation may
include data such as the names of personnel who were exposed, their location and time in
the hazard area and the monitoring results. Further, commanders provide personnel with
appropriate medical support and training, equipment, and supplies to implement unit and
individual countermeasures. For example, predeployment anthrax vaccinations can
provide increased force protection (FP). Once deployed, personnel are provided updates to
health threats and countermeasures based on need and the situations encountered.

3.    Planning

      The armed forces of the US must be prepared to conduct prompt, sustained, and
decisive operations, in NBC environments. An adversary’s NBC capabilities can have an
impact on a commander’s objectives, plans, and supporting actions and, therefore, must be
taken into account at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. The planning process
basically remains the same across the range of military operations, regardless of the level of
war. Nevertheless, specific NBC defense protection considerations may vary considerably
between strategic-, operational-, and tactical-level operations due to differences in the
mission, available resources, and the size of the operational areas.

      a.   Strategic-Level NBC Defense Protection Planning. The strategic-level planning
will address potential adversaries who might have NBC capabilities—such as global
adversaries, regional adversaries, or nonstate actors. A number of these potential
adversaries have, or could rapidly acquire, NBC weapons and other TIM. Other planning
considerations include providing FP (e.g., minimum MOPP level) and exposure level
guidance.

     b.    Operational-Level NBC Protection Planning. At the operational level, planning
could concentrate on characteristics such as the capability of road, rail, air, and sea
transportation networks to support the movement of adversary NBC weapons; zones of
entry into and through the operational area and area of interest (AOI); the impact of large
geographic features such as mountains, large forests, deserts, and archipelagos on NBC
defense operations; and seasonal climatic effects on NBC weapons. Operational-level
planning also further refines protection guidance and integrates the theater-wide warning
and reporting system.

     c.    Tactical-Level NBC Defense Protection Planning. Tactical-level planning focuses
on ensuring that commanders can accomplish their mission-essential tasks in NBC
environments. At the tactical level, the size and location of the battlespace are influenced
by the physical location of the adversary’s land, air, naval, space, and other forces that
could pose a direct threat to the security of friendly forces or the success of their mission.
The extent to which the battlespace environment is analyzed at the tactical level is largely
dependent on the mission and planning time. Tactical-level planning continues to address




I-6
risk management, protective actions, changing conditions, warning and dewarning of
personnel, and medical surveillance.

4.   Protecting the Force

     Protecting the force consists of those actions taken to prevent or mitigate hostile
actions against personnel, resources, facilities, and critical information. These actions
conserve the force’s fighting potential so that it can be decisively applied. In NBC
environments, the commander must take into account a number of unique considerations
that have a significant effect on FP. These include, but are not limited to, the commander’s
intent, training and leader development, psychological operations (PSYOP), force health
protection, protective equipment, and operations security (OPSEC).

     a.    Commander’s Intent. The commander conducts risk assessments and outlines
what his unit must do to succeed with respect to the enemy, the terrain, and the desired
end state. The intent outlines the key tasks that must be performed. Risk is stated in the
commander’s guidance and is addressed in all COAs. Overall, the risk assessment balances
FP and mission accomplishment.

      b.   Training and Leader Development. Rigorous and realistic individual and joint
unit training across the force ensures readiness to fight and win should an adversary
employ NBC weapons. Training, exercises, professional military education, and leadership
development programs should incorporate the principles for operations in NBC
environments and include the realistic consideration of NBC weapons effects on sustained
combat operations.

      c.    Psychological Operations. As a means to minimize the potential for, and mitigate
the effects of, adversary NBC use, PSYOP can decrease an adversary’s perception of the
utility of NBC weapons, contribute to deterring their employment, and enhance efforts to
reduce an adversary’s domestic and international support.

      d.   Force Health Protection. Medical protection of the force against NBC threats
involves integrated preventive, surveillance, and clinical programs. The commander’s plans
should include PVNTMED, joint medical surveillance, medical evacuation, and provisions
for readily available treatments and supplies to counter the physical effects of NBC
exposure.

     e.    Protective Equipment. Sufficient and appropriate equipment (e.g., protective
masks) must be available to protect not only the uniformed force but also the essential
supporting civilian workforces. Individual and unit training is required for proper sizing,
use of, and care for individual and crew-served equipment. Mask fit validation is also
conducted as part of this process.

      f.   Operations Security. In affecting an adversary’s intelligence, information
operations (IO) (including OPSEC) provide forces with a significant measure of protection
by preventing an adversary from acquiring information necessary to successfully target
forces and facilities. Deception, dispersion of forces, communications security (COMSEC),
and effective use of terrain are examples of measures that complement OPSEC.




                                                                                              I-7
5.    Preparedness

     Varied and unpredictable challenges to US interests in the international security
environment require adequate preparedness in peacetime to facilitate rapid transition to
operations.

      a.   Preparedness in the US and Its Territories.

            (1) Commanders of forces and facilities in the US assess threats and
vulnerabilities that may compromise peacetime operations. A number of state and
nonstate adversaries may choose early NBC employment against the US civilian population
and infrastructures as well as military forces and facilities. Therefore, peacetime
preparedness and planning for transition to operations account for the vulnerabilities that,
if exploited by adversaries, could impede execution of mission-essential tasks.

            (2) Peacetime planning, training, equipping, and supporting actions must
include plans to understand threats, minimize vulnerability, and mitigate the effects of
NBC attacks in order to maintain required force preparedness. Commanders coordinate
with civilian authorities and agencies to prevent and, if necessary, mitigate and manage
the consequences of deliberate or accidental NBC employment or similar toxic material
events in the US. Detailed interagency processes guide the armed forces of the US in
providing military support to civil agencies to cope with such events.

     b.   Preparedness in the Theater Operational Area. Peacetime preparedness for
operations in NBC environments includes measures taken by commanders at intermediate
staging bases or in theater operational areas abroad. Force requirements (including
readiness and FP) in any particular combatant command area may require support not only
from the US but also from other combatant commands.

      c.   Preparedness—Using all the Tools (NBC Information Management).

           (1) Commanders require accurate and timely information (e.g., threat data) as
they prepare for operations in an NBC environment. Decisions rely on SA and an
understanding of the significance of the information (e.g., impact of degradation on the
force). Units translate all source information into an understanding of the NBC threat and
the operational environment. Commanders and staff conduct timely risk assessments and
recommend specific COAs for reducing risk and countering specific threats. To maintain
SA, units use information from sources such as the NBCWRS to report suspected and
actual NBC attacks.

           (2) Units obtain relevant data (see Figure I-1, [page I-10]) from multiple
sources (e.g., sensors, detectors, and other reconnaissance and surveillance assets). The
appropriate data (e.g., type of agent, time of detection, weather data, and location) is
processed, extracted, formatted, and forwarded. Commanders and their staffs evaluate the
information to assess its impact on operations. The risk assessment then may lead to
directives/orders to help mitigate the impact of the assessed hazard. Commanders may
direct an integrated series of protective measures (e.g., increased MOPP posture) to
decrease the level of risk (e.g., decrease exposure opportunity), and the plan is revised as
updated information is received.



I-8
          (3) The command and staff conduct preplanning to determine critical data
requirements. The relevant choices are prioritized as PIR and a data collection plan is
prepared. The overall data collection effort shares common characteristics:

                  •   Connectivity between lower, higher, and adjacent units.

                  •   Ability to forward relevant data to multiple echelons of command
simultaneously.

                 • Capability to conduct technical reach back to obtain access to strategic
intelligence, operational, logistical, or technical information to provide information for
operational assessments. Reach back provides the additional capability to enhance
effective use of modeling and simulation to conduct region-specific, expert evaluation of
potential NBC weapons effects as well as toxic industrial chemical, biological, and
radiological releases.

           (4) Units receive, process, and evaluate data received. The data may be
incomplete; therefore, it is assessed and evaluated in light of information from other
sources. The available data is synthesized to assess its operational significance. The
evaluated information may result in no action being taken, or the information received may
be translated into an input that affects the military decision-making process (MDMP).

           (5) The evaluated information is used to support the MDMP. For example, the
process could provide information to support hazard prediction and selected warnings to
affected units.

     d.    Preparedness—Understanding the Environment. Commanders and staffs
understand the impact of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) and/or the
accidental or deliberate use of TIM on FP.

           (1) Chemical weapons can be used to restrict the mobility of maneuver forces,
contaminate air base (AB) or port operations, cause immediate and delayed casualties, and
force an increase in protective measures. Persistent agents are typically used against
deeper targets or those areas not expected to be immediately occupied.




I-10
           (2) Biological weapons can be used to cause large numbers of casualties, and
the area coverage for a biological warfare (BW) weapon can be far greater than for a
chemical attack.

           (3) Nuclear weapons can cause tremendous adverse blast, thermal energy,
radioactive, and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) effects. The initial and residual effects of a
nuclear weapon can cause large numbers of casualties, material damage, and
contamination.

          (4) Potential terrorist use of CBRN weapons also creates tremendous
challenges for commanders. Potentially, a covert incident could occur at any time.

           (5) TIM (through accidental or incidental release or terrorist actions) may also
impact FP. A commander’s situational awareness (SA) extends throughout the AO within
which his forces will operate.

           (6)   The proliferation of TBM increases the range from which an adversary
could strike.

            (7) Secondary threats may also exist during and after some TBM attacks.
TBMs may have warheads that do not separate from the missile body but remain together
until the missile warhead functions or the missile impacts the ground. Even if the warhead
functions or is hit with an antiballistic missile (ABM), the missile components continue on a
ballistic trajectory and impact the ground. In addition to potential explosive or CB hazards,
the missile may impact a building or create a crater. The impact site may contain hazards
from the remaining missile fuel and oxidizer or from the facility or structure the missile hit
(fuel, power lines, munitions, etc.). Personnel in MOPP4 are protected from potential CB
hazards but may not be fully protected from the unused or unburned missile oxidizers and
fuel hazards. Depending on the quantity remaining, the residual fuel and oxidizer (such as
red, fuming nitric acid) present a potential toxic chemical hazard to personnel. These
chemicals may also cause chemical detectors, such as M8 paper, to falsely indicate the
presence of an agent or mask the presence of the actual agent.

6.   Protection Components

     NBC protection is a command responsibility and the commander must direct actions
to ensure continued mission accomplishment. There are broad groups of activity that
comprise protective measures, such as individual protection, reacting to an attack,
COLPRO, and health service support (HSS).

      a.   Individual Protection. Individual protection includes actions taken by individuals
to survive and sustain operations under NBC conditions.

            (1) Background. The commander provides FP guidance in orders and/or
directives. The establishment of protection guidance provides unit personnel and mission-
essential civilian personnel with key information (e.g., individual protection guidance,
training, equipment) to ensure that they are prepared (see Chapter VI and Appendix A for
information and descriptions of individual protection and IPE capabilities, respectively).



                                                                                          I-11
          (2)   Preattack Protection Measures. These protection measures can include—

                •   Providing realistic, integrated training.

                • Using camouflage, concealment, and deception (CCD). CCD measures
cannot protect personnel from the effects of enemy attacks but can hide individuals and
units from enemies threatening an NBC attack.

                 • Being ready to prepare positions. Take actions to make positions more
resistant to the blast effects of conventional or nuclear munitions; to the heat and radiation
of nuclear weapons; and to the contamination from CBRN weapons.

                •   Conducting MOPP analysis (see Appendixes A, B, and C).

                • Being ready to prepare personnel. Under the threat of enemy NBC
attacks, leaders must ensure that individual and collective protection (see Appendix B)
equipment is prepared and readily available.

                •   Remaining mobile.

                • Being ready to take actions, such as placing equipment under overhead
cover such as buildings or aircraft hangars.

                •   Covering supplies and equipment (e.g., use NBC protective covers).

                •   Monitoring unit radiation exposure (see Appendix D).

           (3) MOPP. MOPP balances protection requirements and performance
degradation with mission requirements. The commander has the responsibility for
providing guidance for levels of protection. The higher the MOPP level, the more protection
it provides, but the more it degrades performance. The leader’s MOPP decisions are based
on factors such as the threat, temperature, work rate, hydration requirements, and mission
(see Chapter V).

                 (a) MOPP Analysis. Leaders—generally at shipboard, air operating base,
and brigade/battalion level—establish protection levels based on a risk analysis (RA) of
their unit’s particular situation. The RA finds the balance between reducing the risk of
casualties and accomplishing the mission.

                 (b) Specialized Protective Requirements. Individual protective
requirements (see Appendix E) during TIM threat conditions—such as operations near
damaged industrial resources or other military operations other than war (MOOTW)
situations—may also require the use of other standard protection levels, such as those
specified by the US Environmental Protection Agency Levels A through D (see applicable
service references such as Field Manual [FM] 3-11.21 Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures for Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Aspects of Consequence Management).

     b.   Reacting to an Attack. Personnel take immediate action to reduce the impact of
an NBC attack. Commanders determine the risk they are willing to take depending on the
missions that must be accomplished. They take poststrike actions to restore fighting power


I-12
and prepare to continue the mission. Specific actions vary according to the type of attack
(see Chapter II).

     c.    COLPRO. Collective NBC protection is that protection provided to a group of
individuals in an NBC environment and complements the individual protection provided by
MOPP gear. Under expected NBC contamination conditions, COLPRO is designed to
provide a toxic-free work environment for personnel. Under TIM conditions, COLPRO may
provide limited or uncertain protection for personnel. Alternatively, it may allow personnel
to temporarily remove overgarments. When CPS are used to provide relief from wearing
MOPP, commanders may establish a system for rotation of personnel (see Chapter VII and
Appendix B for more information on COLPRO). When COLPRO is used in support of
medical treatment facilities (MTF), commanders must ensure that contaminated patients
are decontaminated before they are received in the COLPRO area.

     d.    HSS.

          (1) NBC protection must include provisions for adequate HSS. Commanders
are responsible for health maintenance of their personnel to ensure mission
accomplishment in the event of NBC attacks. Planning and training actions must include
health maintenance of the essential civilian workforce members supporting military
operations as well as the integration of military capabilities with those of the local public
health services, including those of the HN for operations abroad.

            (2) Preparations for operations in potential NBC environments include
preexposure immunizations, pretreatments, prophylaxis, and medical barrier materials
(e.g., creams) applicable to the entire force—including multinational, interagency, and
civilian participants. Postexposure measures require prior planning and include the
continuation of preventive measures. In contaminated environments, commanders take
action to ensure continued HSS capabilities, to include providing decontamination support
and security from nonmedical resources.




                                                                                             I-13
                                         Chapter II

PREATTACK, DURING-ATTACK, AND POSTATTACK PROTECTIVE
                      ACTIONS


1.   Background

     This chapter addresses preattack, during-attack, and postattack actions that can be
taken in the event of an NBC attack. Because operations in an NBC environment could also
include TIM incidents, this chapter addresses suggested protective actions that could be
taken in response to a TIM event.

2.   Common Preattack Actions

      Personnel take protective actions before an attack (preattack), during the attack, and
following the attack (postattack). These actions are based on the type of attack and other
factors.

     a.   There are many common preattack actions that can be taken to prepare for
operations in an NBC environment. These actions could include—

           (1) Designating Proposed Decontamination Sites. Commanders designate
proposed decontamination sites utilizing mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and
support available—time available (METT-T); water availability; trafficability; accessibility;
and logistics supportability.

           (2) Assessing NBC Threat, Potential Risk, Likelihood of Attack, and
Vulnerability. Commanders must continuously monitor intelligence assessments,
SITREPS, and other related information to prepare themselves to make an informed
decision on whether or not to implement NBC defense measures upon notification of an
attack. The vulnerability assessment (VA) also provides for identification of TIM storage,
production, transit sites, and pipelines within an AO.

           (3) Implementing Coordinated NBC Defense Plans. Commanders should direct
implementation of the coordinated NBC defense plans developed for their unit. The kinds of
actions to be implemented include, but are not limited to, dispersing available detectors,
distributing IPE, and conducting training. The NBC defense plan may also include
provision for processing of noncombatants in an NBC environment (see Appendix F).

            (4) Preparing to Provide Primary Care for Unit Casualties. Unit commanders
should have their personnel prepare contingency plans for first aid and transport of unit
casualties.

          (5) Determining and Implementing MOPP. Based on the situation,
commanders should determine and implement the appropriate MOPP level and variation if
appropriate.


                                                                                           II-1
Note: See Chapters V and VI and Appendixes A and C for more information that supports
implementing appropriate MOPP levels.

           (6) Minimizing Skin Exposure. Commanders should direct personnel to
minimize skin exposure for protection against hazards (e.g., wearing shirt sleeves down and
closing neck buttons). Although inhalation of an agent is a concern, many agents can enter
the body by penetrating the skin or through skin cuts, cracks, or abrasions.

           (7) Continuing Good Hygiene Sanitation Methods. Commanders should require
their personnel to practice proper hygiene and sanitation methods at all times.

          (8) Deploying and Activating Detectors. Each unit, as part of the NBC defense
plan, should deploy available detectors.

            (9) Designating and Preparing Shelters. The commander should direct and
designate appropriate C2 and rest and relief shelters. Protection from weapons effects, such
as liquid and vapor contamination, blast, shrapnel, and heat, should determine the
suitability of buildings as shelters.

Note: See Chapter VII and Appendix B for information on COLPRO and collective
protective equipment (CPE), respectively.

           (10) Watching for Attack Indicators. All personnel should be alert for signs of
attack. Attack indicators support the IPB process through providing data from NBC
reconnaissance measures. The NBC reconnaissance input can support confirmation or
denial of possible adversary COAs.

            (11) Covering Unprotected, Mission-Essential Equipment. Commanders should
direct units to cover mission-essential equipment to prevent contamination from being
deposited on the equipment. This will reduce the need for decontamination and minimize
the possibility of personnel contaminating themselves if they have to handle the equipment
at a later time.

           (12) Conducting Meteorological Monitoring. Meteorology is an important factor
on the impact of a CB aerosol release (whether overt or covert). If conditions for CB agent
release are possible (e.g., threat indicators are present), commanders may direct search or
surveillance activities or other NBC defense actions.

          (13) Integrating Available Alarm and Warning Systems.

                (a)   Alarm and Detector Systems.

                     • CBRN Capability. CBRN agent alarms/detectors represent
another common critical element for effective defense. Without them, a unit cannot be
alerted and cannot detect contamination. Once in a high-threat area, alarms and/or
detectors must be in use. The alternative is to have the units take protective measures (e.g.,
donning protective gear). This equipment provides units with the capability to detect CBRN
agents.




II-2
                      • Biological Capability. The first signal that a unit has been exposed
to a biological agent may occur when large numbers of personnel become sick. However,
there are specialized biological point detectors that are available (e.g., USN Interim
Biological Agent Detection System [IBADS], DOD biological handheld sampling kits, and
USA Biological Integrated Detection System [BIDS]) for support of the air, land, and
maritime components.

                (b) Warning Signals (Land Force and AB). The basic types of attack
warning signals are sound and visual. Personnel should warn others, using one or more of
these signals. Personnel give the alarm as soon as an attack or a hazard is detected and use
an alarm method that cannot be confused easily with other combat signals or sounds. All
who hear or see the alarm must repeat it swiftly throughout their areas and supplement
the warning with all available communications capability.

                       • Vocal. The spoken word is the first way of informing personnel of
an NBC hazard or attack. The vocal alarm for any CB hazard or attack is the word gas. The
person giving the alarm masks first and then shouts, “Gas!” as loudly as possible. Everyone
hearing this alarm immediately masks and then repeats the alarm. The vocal alarm for the
arrival of radiological contamination in a unit area is the word fallout. The first individual
to detect the arrival of fallout will usually be a radiological monitor operating a radiac
meter at the unit command post (CP). When the radiac meter records an increase in dose
rate to 1 centigray per hour (cGyph) or higher (or other service-determined threshold), the
monitor should immediately alert unit personnel.

                      • Sound. Sound signals reinforce the vocal alarm to warn of the
imminent arrival or the presence of NBC hazards. Sound signals consist of a succession of
short signals—such as the rapid and continuous beating on a metal object or anything that
produces a loud noise. The warning could be made by a succession of short blasts on a
vehicle horn or an interrupted warbling siren sound in situations where vocal alarms or the
sound of beating on metal would be lost because of battlefield noise.

                     • Visual. Standard hand-and-arm signals may be used for NBC
hazards. They consist of putting on the protective mask, extending both arms to the side
horizontally with doubled fists facing up, and moving the fists rapidly up to the head and
back down to the horizontal position.

                     • Visual/Audiovisual. If the automatic chemical agent alarms
(ACAAs) are in operation, detected agents will trigger a visual and auditory alarm unit.
The person who sees or hears an alarm signal from the alarm unit immediately masks and
augments this signal with a vocal signal. Communications personnel who hear the vocal
signal immediately mask and relay the signal over the unit communications nets.
Personnel reinforce this signal with other sounds or visual signals.

                (c) Shipboard Alarms. The shipboard interior communications general
announcing system is integrated with a system of alarm signals such as the general and
chemical alarm. The signals override the microphone control stations and are intended to
notify the crew of imminent danger.




                                                                                             II-3
                     • General Alarm. The general alarm signal is sounded by the officer
of the deck (OOD) to notify the crew of a battle condition. Some ships sound battle stations
(material condition ZEBRA) by the use of a bugle or a boatswain pipe. Others simply pass
the word, “Man your battle stations.” All hands will report to preassigned stations and set
material condition ZEBRA.

                     • Chemical Alarm. The chemical alarm signal is sounded by the
OOD, the damage control officer (DCO), or automatically by the shipboard chemical agent
point detection system when there has been an attack on or in the vicinity of the ship. All
hands exercise protective measures to reduce exposure and injuries.

weather data, water availability, trafficability, accessibility, and logistics support ability.

                   (15) Using Warning Signals for AB/Fixed Sites.

                        (a) Standardized Warning Signals. Commanders use standardized
warning signals to prepare ABs or fixed sites for attacks, warn of attacks in progress,
initiate postattack recovery actions, and return the installation to a normal wartime state
of readiness. Table II-1 covers suggested warning signals and required actions for
installations within the continental United States (CONUS) and in US territories. Table II-
2 (page II-6) provides recommended standardized warning signals and required actions for
overseas bases subject to attack.

II-4
                 (b) Quick Communication. Warning signals quickly communicate the
commanders' intentions; direct personnel and units to take preplanned, time-phased
defense actions; or simply notify everyone to take cover. Signals used to initiate preplanned
actions may be specific to one or more functional areas. Other actions, such as assuming
predesignated MOPP conditions or seeking protective cover or shelter, may apply to most of
the base or the fixed-site population. Although warning signals are primarily designed to
provide air, missile, artillery, and ground attack warning, they may be used to warn of
covert attacks with CB weapons.

                 (c)   Alarm Conditions.

                      • Commanders declare alarm conditions to initiate passive defense
actions in wartime. Unless local or theater requirements dictate otherwise, bases or fixed
sites generally use the warning signals and alarm conditions listed in Table II-2 (page II-6).
Alarm conditions, combined with supplemental instructions through the chain of command,
are the most effective way to establish a defensive posture. When NBC threats are present,
the commander can further direct options that could range from MOPP levels 0 to 4 and
also use variations (e.g., mask only) to provide the minimum level of protection for the
current mission and situation.

                      • Warning signals are used that are compatible with HN, local, or
theater systems. The base or fixed site warning system must provide effective coverage for
all areas. Warning signals are displayed as visual aids in all work centers and common use
areas (such as billeting tents, post offices, latrines, dining facilities, recreation areas, etc.).
Transient and new personnel are briefed on warning signals and protective actions.

                     • Commanders are authorized wide latitude in determining warning
signals. This information may include changes in alarm color codes or audible signals to
accommodate theater or HN requirements and supplemental information to respond to
specific weapons or threats. Standard warning signals should be used to the greatest extent
possible. Regardless of the signals used, commanders are responsible for disseminating the
warning signals information to all assigned, attached, and transient personnel to ensure
that they take correct defensive actions in response to the base warning signals.

  ¹ Wear field gear and personal body armor (if issued) when outdoors or when directed.

  ² Commanders may direct continuation of mission-essential tasks or functions at increased risk.

  ³ This alarm condition may be applied to an entire installation or assigned to one or more defense sectors or zones.


           (16) Analyzing Warning Time Assessments. Commanders analyze the potential
attack warning process to identify limitation and deficiencies. Warning times will vary by
threat and the real-time ability of both theater and installation warning systems to
disseminate warning information. Analyze the warning system performance for each
primary threat (missile, aircraft, ground, etc.). Use the analysis to develop a chain of events
timeline that identifies each primary and secondary warning event from initial event
detection through notification to the lowest unit level. These time lines enable the chain-of-
command to develop and practice preplanned scenarios and quickly adjust strategies to
react to attack situations. For example, installations may receive little (several minutes) or



II-6
no warning of missile or artillery attacks. However, aircraft, cruise missile, and remotely
piloted vehicle attack warning times (due to different flight profiles) may be long enough
(tens of minutes) to allow extensive preplanned actions. Regardless of the warning times,
commanders and their staffs must quickly analyze the available attack information,
evaluate the effect on current operations, and decide on the most effective COAs within the
time available.

            (17) Monitoring status of NBC Equipment and Supplies. Units assess the
logistics supportability of each COA and determine what equipment and supplies (see
Appendix G) are needed.

           (18) Preparing for Contingencies. Units prepare for unexpected situations. The
preparation could include handling instructions for weapons of mass destruction (WMD)
threats using postal mail or packages (see Appendix H).

   b.   Specific preattack, during-attack, and postattack actions (unique to NBC,
COLPRO, and TIM) are discussed in the following paragraphs.

3.   Nuclear Protection

      This paragraph discusses preattack, during-attack, and postattack aspects of
protection that can be accomplished in the event of a nuclear attack. Personnel must make
defensive preparations to protect themselves; the effective use of terrain and shelter is also
very important. Additionally, a nuclear attack can also create EMP effects.

      •   By knowing how terrain affects nuclear weapons, personnel can greatly reduce
the risk of becoming casualties. With training and practice, they can learn to recognize
defensive positions that will give them optimum protection against a nuclear blast.

      •   Hills and Mountains. Reverse slopes of hills and mountains give some nuclear
protection. Heat and light from the fireball of a nuclear blast and the initial radiation tend
to be absorbed by hills and mountains. What is not absorbed deflects above the personnel
because of the slope.

     •    Depressions and Obstructions. The use of gullies, ravines, ditches, natural
depressions, fallen trees, and caves can reduce nuclear casualties. However, predicting the
actual point of a nuclear attack is almost impossible. The best protection remains an area
below ground with some sort of overhead cover.

      •  Obscuration. When the threat of nuclear weapons use is high, smoke can be used
to attenuate the thermal energy effects from nuclear detonations.

      a.   Preattack Actions. Preattack actions are critical because they will increase the
unit’s survivability to the greatest possible extent. These actions range from selecting the
right shelters, fortifying those shelters, and protecting vital equipment to using equipment
to increase survivability. Whenever the tactical situation permits, units prepare defensive
positions. These will vary from individual fighting positions to improved defensive
positions. These actions and good prior planning protect against nuclear effects. One
primary concern should be protection from gamma and neutron radiation. Gamma



                                                                                            II-7
radiation protection requires thick layers of dense or heavy shielding material, such as
lead, iron, or stone. On the other hand, light, hydrogen-based material gives good neutron
radiation protection. Some examples are water, paraffin, and oil.

Note: The balance of the information in paragraphs 2 through 4 applies to land forces. See
NWP 3-20.31 (Revision A), Surface Ship Survivability, for TTP on maritime CBR defense
measures.

Note: See Appendix D for more detailed information on radiological protection—such as
operational exposure guide (OEG), low-level radiation (LLR) exposure, and depleted
uranium (DU).

           (1)   Fighting Positions.

                 (a) Digging in provides improved defense, because earth is a good
shielding material. A well-constructed fighting position gives excellent protection against
initial nuclear effects. It can also reduce residual radiation (fallout). Personnel must harden
their fighting positions against the blast wave as time permits. Lining or revetting fighting
positions can significantly increase survivability and decrease the size of the opening into
the position. Smaller openings allow entry of less initial and residual radiation. However,
many metal surfaces are good thermal reflectors. Cover these surfaces to prevent an
increased danger of burns from the heat of nuclear blasts.

               (b) The smaller the fighting position opening, the better. Most of the
gamma radiation in the bottom of a fighting position enters through the opening. The
smaller opening of a one-person fighting position reduces gamma radiation two to four
times below the amount that a two-person foxhole allows to enter.

                 (c) A deep fighting position gives more radiation protection than a
shallow one. It places a greater thickness of shielding material or earth between the
occupant and the nuclear detonation. Therefore, it prevents less initial radiation from
entering. In a two-person fighting position, radiation reduces by a factor of 2 for each 16
inches of fighting position depth.

                 (d) Thermal radiation can reach personnel in fighting positions by line-of-
sight (LOS) exposure or by reflection off the sides. Use dark, rough materials to cover
potential reflecting surfaces and as protective covers. Examples are wool (such as blankets)
and canvas. Remember that thermal exposure may still burn or char these materials. Avoid
direct contact with them. Do not use rubber or plastic materials alone. These items might
melt and cause burns. Simply covering a position with ordinary metal screening material
blocks the thermal radiation by about 50 percent. Use this screening for thermal protection
without entirely blocking the view through the ports. Personnel must cover exposed
portions, and they must keep low. Keeping low reduces thermal exposure just as it reduces
nuclear radiation exposure.

           (2)   Field-Expedient Overhead Cover.

                 (a) An overhead covering of earth or other material reduces exposure to
thermal and initial nuclear radiation and fallout. Overhead covering helps prevent collapse.
It also provides protection against debris, such as falling rocks.



II-8
                (b) Beware of poorly constructed overhead covers. A cover must be strong
enough to withstand the blast wave. Use U-shaped metal pickets, timbers, or certain
fabrics; and overlay them with sandbags or earth. Ammunition boxes filled with earth also
make good cover. In constructing an effective overhead cover, remember the following:

                     •   Choose dense covering materials.

                     •   Cover in depth.

                     •   Provide strong supports.

                     •   Cover as much of the opening as possible.

                 (c) A vehicle provides expedient overhead cover. A simple and fast
method is to drive a vehicle over the top of a fighting position. A heavy armored vehicle is
better than a wheeled vehicle. As with any type of overhead cover, initial radiation can still
enter the fighting position through the earth sides or the openings in the sides of the
vehicle (between treads, road wheels, and tires). If time allows, use sandbags to cover these
openings. Remember, the vehicle is not a good neutron shield. Also, the blast wave may
violently displace the vehicle and collapse a fighting position.

          (3)   Earth-Shielded Positions.

                (a) Well-constructed fighting positions and bunkers can provide excellent
protection against all effects of a nuclear detonation. Radiation is still an important
concern, though, because of its great penetrating power. Radiation scatters in all directions
after a blast.

                 (b) It is important that as much earth cover as possible be placed between
the individual and the blast. The more earth cover, the better the shielding. Table II-3
(page II-10) illustrates the value of increasing amounts of earth shielding from a
hypothetical, free-in-air dose. An open fighting position gives a protection factor of 8. It
blocks most of the LOS radiation and allows only a fraction of scattered radiation to enter.
Each added 6-inch thickness of overhead earth cover reduces the scattered radiation by a
factor of 2.




                                                                                           II-9

               (c) The flat earth cover of an underground shelter protects much better
than an equivalent thickness of cover on a similar aboveground structure. This is because
the underground LOS thickness is greater.

                 (d) A second layer of sandbags gives more protection to fighting positions.
Each layer of sandbags, if filled with sand or compacted clay, reduces the transmitted
radiation by a factor of 2. Table II-4 shows the advantage of adding layers of sandbags for a
hypothetical, free-in-air dose of 2,400 centigray (cGy).

        Layers (12 Inches)


                 (e) Sand or compacted clay gives better radiation shielding than earth
because it is denser. Each layer of sand- or clay-filled sandbags can give up to 66 percent
more radiation protection than the same thickness of soil or soil-filled sandbags. Table II-4
shows that three layers of sand or clay-filled sandbags give a protection factor of 64 (38
cGy). Generally, heavy sandbags protect better than light ones.

                (f) Neutron radiation can be stopped. Water delays and absorbs neutrons,
but since some gamma radiation is given off in the process, dense shielding is still required.
Damp earth or concrete protects from both forms of radiation. For example, only 12 inches



II-10
of concrete or 24 inches of damp earth reduce neutron radiation exposure by a factor of 10.
Wet sandbags achieve a reduction factor of 2 for every 4-inch layer. Other expedient
neutron-shielding materials include containers of water, fuel, or oil. Remember that
radiation scatters in all directions, and shielding must provide all-around protection.

                (g) Protect sandbags from exposure to thermal radiation. Sandbags can
burn and spill their contents, which can then be moved more easily by the blast wave.
Cover sandbags with a small amount of earth and/or sod to eliminate this problem.
Covering sandbags also enhances camouflage and provides valuable fragmentation
protection.

          (4)   Buildings.

                (a) Certain types of buildings offer excellent shelter from nuclear hazards
and require minimum of time and effort to adapt for use. Choose buildings carefully. The
stronger the structure, the better the protection against blast effects. The strongest are
heavily framed buildings of steel and reinforced concrete. The worst choices are shed-type
industrial buildings with light frames and long beam spans. Even well-constructed frame
houses are stronger than the latter. Ammunition storage bunkers also give exceptional
protection. These are usually large enough for most vehicles and equipment.

                (b) Many European, rural and urban structures can provide good
protection. Many types of pre-World War II European buildings provide good blast and
radiation protection. Examples are farmhouses, churches, and municipal buildings.
Characteristics to look for include the following:

                     • Pre-World War II buildings. These have thick, full-span floor and
ceiling beams; heavy roofing tiles; dense, reinforced walls; and, in most cases, a full
basement.

                       • Full basements constructed of concrete or stone. Make sure that
there is an exit directly to the outside as well as through the upper floors in case of
emergency.

                     •   Thick-walled masonry structures.

                      • Buildings with very little glass. European windows are typically
protected by roll-up or folding shutters. These coverings provide some additional blast and
thermal protection.

                 (c) A shielded building is best. Exterior rows of buildings in closely
arranged groups (towns) shield buildings in the interior. These shielded structures suffer
less blast overpressure and structural damage than exposed structures. However, debris
and rubble problems and fire hazards may increase toward the center of town.
Commanders should consider using shelters located two or three building rows from the
edge of town to avoid serious hindrance to postattack mobility.

               (d) Personnel should move below ground level. The basement, because it
is below ground, provides increased blast protection and much more LOS radiation



                                                                                         II-11
protection than aboveground floors. This additional protection results from the surrounding
earth fill. Add additional radiation protection by placing a layer of earth or sandbags on the
floor above. This additional deadweight will be significant and may require shoring up the
floor. Alternately, more protection can be gained by sandbagging a smaller shelter in the
basement (such as a sturdy table) without increasing the possibility of the entire floor
collapsing. Block windows with sandbags and enhance the radiation protection and
structural strength of any aboveground exterior walls by piling dirt and sandbags against
the walls. Generally speaking, personnel can reduce radiation by a factor of 10 in
basements as compared to levels in aboveground floors.

                 (e) Positions inside the building can make a difference if sufficient time is
available to properly prepare them. On floors aboveground, the center of the building offers
the greatest protection from both initial and residual radiation. Belowground, the corners of
the building give the greatest protection. In either case, the dose to prone personnel would
be about one-half the dose to a standing individual. The lesson here is to seek shelter in an
underground structure and lie in a corner. If an underground shelter is not available, lie in
the center of a shelter under a sturdy table. Other options include lying inside a fireplace,
under a stairway, or in a bathroom where the plumbing and relatively close spacing of walls
might provide increased structural strength.

          (5) Tents. Tents are not a preferred shelter against the effects of nuclear
weapons. A tent does provide some protection from residual nuclear effects (e.g., particulate
fallout).

           (6) Armored Vehicles. Armored vehicles provide good nuclear protection. In
most situations, tanks offer the best vehicular protection available. Lightly armored
vehicles also offer good protection. These vehicles include infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs),
self-propelled artillery, and some heavy engineer equipment. If time is available, this
protection can be improved with any of the following actions:

                 (a) Keep as low as possible inside an armored vehicle. Crew members
normally elevated in a tank turret should get on the floor of the armored vehicle. This
applies to the tank commander, gunner, and loader. Assuming such a low position reduces
the radiation received by a factor of 4.

                (b) Keep all hatches shut. Obviously, an open hatch will expose the crew
unnecessarily to explosion effects. It could subsequently allow the entry of fallout particles
and scattered gamma radiation. Close any other openings, such as the main gun breech.

               (c) Prevent injury while inside an armored vehicle. The blast wave will
throw personnel violently about inside an armored vehicle. Wear a helmet with the
chinstrap secured to help prevent head injuries.

                (d) Secure all loose equipment inside the vehicle. The force of the blast
can throw about unsecured, loose equipment (such as tools, weapons, and helmets) inside
the vehicle and cause injury or death to personnel.

               (e) Dig-in armored vehicles (hull defilade) or place them in trenches or
cuts in roadways. This provides some limited LOS radiation protection and considerable



II-12
blast protection. A hull defilade fighting position or a trench that allows half of the vehicle
sides to be covered can reduce gamma radiation by as much as a factor of 2.

                 (f) Use sandbags as radiation shielding. A single layer of sandbags placed
on top of a tank turret or an armored vehicle hull provides valuable overhead gamma
shielding. Each layer of sandbags reduces the gamma radiation by a factor of 2. Wetting the
sandbags enhances the neutron radiation shielding and protects the sandbags from thermal
damage.

           (7)   Wheeled Vehicles.

                  (a) Avoid using wheeled vehicles as shelter. Generally, wheeled vehicles
provide little or no protection from the effects of nuclear explosions. Worse still, they are
particularly vulnerable to overturning. This exposes drivers and passengers to increased
risks.

                 (b)   Ensure that personnel protect themselves as much as possible inside
the vehicles.

                 (c)   Secure all loose equipment inside the vehicles.

                  (d) Plan for and prepare adequate field shelters immediately adjacent to
facilities that require personnel to continue operations in wheeled vehicles. Parking the
vehicle inside or under a shelter gives some protection to the personnel inside. Existing or
natural structures—such as ammunition bunkers, underpasses, tunnels, and caves—are in
this category.

           (8)   Aircraft Ground Operations.

                 (a) Revetments give little protection against blast overpressure. However,
revetments and barricades protect aircraft from damage by dynamic wind. These also
protect aircraft from other hazards—such as the impact of rocks, sand, and other aircraft or
aircraft debris. The tactical situation may require revetting for protection from
conventional weapons blast and fragmentation damage. Use overhead cover for aircraft if it
is available. Close doors and windows against damaging overpressure.

                (b) Tie-downs can reduce damage from tumbling of the aircraft.
Generally, tie-downs do not produce excessive stress on tie-down points. Aircraft plexiglass
windows shatter into fragments. This can happen at low-blast overpressure (1.5 pounds per
square inch [psi]) when there is no other significant damage. Tape the edges and the
centers of windows. This reduces the extent of fragmentation and the nuisance that
fragments may cause to cockpit operations.

           (9) Electromagnetic Equipment. When enough warning has been given,
commanders must ensure that electronic equipment, such as radios and computers, are
turned off and protected. EMP is the high-energy, short-duration pulse (similar in some
respects to a bolt of lightning) generated by a nuclear detonation. It can induce a current in
any electrical conductor and temporarily disrupt or overload and damage components of
improperly protected or unprotected electronic equipment.



                                                                                            II-13
      b.   During-Attack Actions. Nuclear attack indicators are unmistakable. The bright
flash, enormous explosion, high winds, and mushroom-shaped cloud clearly indicate a
nuclear attack. An enemy attack would normally come without warning. Initial actions
must, therefore, be automatic and instinctive.

           (1) An attack occurring without warning is immediately noticeable. The first
indication will be very intense light. Heat and initial radiation come with the light, and the
blast follows within seconds. Time needed to take protective action will be minimal. If
exposed when a detonation occurs, personnel should do the following:

                 • Drop facedown immediately with feet facing the blast. This will lessen
the possibility of heat/blast injuries to the head, face, and neck. A log, a large rock, or any
depression in the earth’s surface provides some protection.

                •   Close eyes.

               • Protect exposed skin from heat by putting hands and arms under or
near the body and keeping the helmet on.

                •   Remain facedown until the blast wave passes and debris stops falling.

           (2) Personnel should stay calm, check for injury, check weapons and equipment
for damage, and prepare to continue the mission. Personnel in fighting positions can take
additional precautions. The fighting position puts more earth between personnel and the
potential source of radiation. They can curl up on one side, but the best position is on the
back with knees drawn up to the chest. This position may seem vulnerable, but the arms
and legs are more radiation-resistant and will protect the head and trunk. Personnel can
also seek other forms of overhead protection (if available) within a fighting position/shelter
in case the overhead cover/roof collapses. Store bulky equipment, such as packs or radios,
in adjacent pits if they prevent personnel from keeping low in their positions, or place these
items over the face and hands for additional radiation and blast protection.

           (3) Personnel inside shelters should take protective actions. A blast wave can
enter the shelter with great force, and the debris it carries can cause injuries. Lying
facedown on the floor of the shelter offers protection. However, avoid the violent flow of air
from doors or windows. Lying near a wall is safer than standing away from a wall.
Constructing baffles or turns in shelter entrances can prevent overpressure buildups and
the entry of dust and debris.

      c.   Postattack Actions. Protection must not stop when the attack ends. Immediately
after an attack, postattack recovery begins.

          (1) Personnel must check for radioactive contamination and, then, must reduce
the hazard with basic decontamination. Decontamination techniques to reduce radioactive
contamination are to brush, scrape, or flush radiological contamination from surfaces.

          (2) As a minimum, unit personnel cover positions and shelters, and radiac
meter operators begin continuous monitoring. IPE reduces the amount of contaminants
that can enter the lungs and the potential for skin burns from beta and alpha particles.



II-14
           (3) For the commander, poststrike actions include damage assessment and the
restoration of combat power.

           (4) Commanders and NBC personnel must also monitor schedules for pieces of
NBC equipment having filters. Exchange is based on service equipment directives or when
the following conditions are applicable:

                •   Physical damage occurs.

                •   Filters have become waterlogged or wet.

                •   High resistance to airflow is observed.

                •   Directed to exchange filters by higher HQ.

                •   Listed as unserviceable in applicable directives.

     d.    Nuclear Casualties. Blast, thermal radiation, and nuclear radiation all cause
nuclear casualties. Except for radiation casualties, treat nuclear casualties the same as
conventional casualties. Wounds caused by blast are similar to other combat wounds.
Thermal burns are treated as any other type of burn. First aid cannot help radiation
casualties. These casualties must be referred to medical facilities.

4.   Biological Protection

      This section discusses preattack, during-attack, and postattack aspects of protective
actions that must be accomplished in the event of a biological attack. Protection against
biological agents begins long before the actual attack happens. Biological agents can enter
the body through the skin, respiratory tract, and digestive tract. Key preparations begin
with personal health maintenance followed by NBC defensive training, which all personnel
must master.

      a.   Biological Agents. Biological agents can be classified according to their biological
type, operational effects, and physiological action. Operationally, biological agents are best
thought of as either pathogens or toxins.

           • Pathogens. Pathogens are living organisms. As such, they require certain
conditions of temperature, humidity, protection from sunlight, and a susceptible host
population. The biological agent must overcome a host’s natural defenses (during a latent
period) in order to cause illness. The duration period of this incubation could last from
hours to days. Pathogens can be disseminated in wet or dry form or by vectors (e.g.,
mosquitoes). Additionally, some pathogens are contagious and can be spread from
individual to individual; therefore, personnel not in the initial area of attack could become
casualties. Following a large-scale dissemination of a biological agent, an initial disease
outbreak of epidemic proportions might occur.

          • Toxins. Toxins are poisons naturally produced through the activities of living
organisms. Some toxins can now be artificially synthesized (e.g., powder form) and
disseminated in liquid or dry form. Generally, toxins do not cause immediate casualty-


                                                                                            II-15
producing effects, and any casualties will arise hours to days after exposure. Unlike
pathogens, toxins are not contagious (e.g., one person cannot infect another).

           (1) Duration of effectiveness. The effectiveness duration of a biological agent
depends on the characteristics of the agent, environmental factors, and any residual
hazards. Solar (ultraviolet) radiation, relative humidity, wind speed, and temperature
gradient are some of the most important weather factors in determining the effectiveness
duration. As previously mentioned, biological agents can be disseminated as aerosols, liquid
droplets, or dry powders.

           (2) Cause of Casualty-Producing Effects. The primary cause of biological-agent,
casualty-producing effects is through inhalation of an aerosol containing particles.
Additionally, casualties can also be caused by the percutaneous effects of agents such as
mycotoxins. Weather conditions have a tremendous impact on the employment of biological
agents. Pathogenic agents will generally dissipate and decay in the presence of ultraviolet
radiation. Some of the agent-containing particles (e.g., spores) disseminated as an aerosol,
may settle out of suspension onto the ground; however, the impact of any residual hazard
from reaerosolization of spores, such as anthrax, may present a hazard for personnel
operating in a contaminated area for extended periods of time.

            (3) Protective Measures. Protective measures include the use of IPE (e.g., a
well-fitted mask), good hygiene, proper sanitation, and up-to-date immunizations. An
individual’s IPE provides protection against BW agents; however, based on the delayed
casualty-producing effects of BW agents, personnel will not likely know an attack has
occurred. See applicable service publications for information on the prevention and
treatment of biological-agent casualties.

      b.   Preattack Actions. Preparations before an attack can be accomplished long
before a biological attack happens. Personal health maintenance and realistic training are
just two ways in which commanders can minimize their biological casualties. All personnel
and leaders must adhere to the basic principles of good health; this applies especially under
NBC conditions.

            (1) Up-to-Date Immunizations. Immunizations reduce the chances of becoming
biological casualties. Proper immunizations protect against many known disease-producing
biological agents. All personnel should receive basic immunizations. Medical personnel will
periodically screen these records and keep them up to date. If units deploy to areas in which
specific diseases are prevalent, readiness preparation may include providing additional
immunizations for needed protection. This prophylactic inoculation should be part of the
IPB process and should be brought to the commander’s attention.

           (2) Good Hygiene. Protect against the spread of disease by practicing good
health habits. The best defense against biological agents is good personal hygiene, keeping
the body as clean as possible. This means not only washing the face and hands, but all
parts of the body—particularly the feet and exposed skin. Hands need to be cleaned before
meals or anytime bare hands are used to help ingest food and liquid or when smoking.
Shaving may seem unimportant in the field, but it is required to achieve a proper seal of
the mask. This is important because biological agents are usually most effective when
received via the respiratory system or the skin. Small nicks, scratches, and cuts are



II-16
unavoidable in a field situation. Pathogens, either naturally occurring or intentionally
employed as biological agents, enter these breaks in the skin and will cause infections if left
untreated. Personnel should clean any breaks in skin with soap and water followed by first
aid treatment.

           (3) Area Sanitation. Another way to stop the spread of disease is to keep the
area clean. Bury all empty ration packets and residue. Locate, construct, and use field
sanitation facilities properly. Latrine facilities should include soap and water for hand
washing. Latrines need to be cleaned daily. Avoid leaving such facilities open, and make
sure that they are properly filled and marked before moving to help prevent accidental
digging in the areas. Control of insects and rodents is also essential in preventing the
spread of disease. Additional information on field sanitation can be found in service
preventive-medicine (PVNTMED) publications.

           (4) Physical Conditioning. Good physical condition requires maintaining the
body in a well-rested, well-fed, and healthy state. Personnel should get as much exercise
and rest as the situation permits, and they must remember to eat properly. If they stay
healthy, their bodies will be better able to fight off germs. A high level of physical fitness
also reduces the likelihood of heat stress when MOPP gear is worn for extended periods.
Continuous operations will require that personnel learn to sleep in short naps and in
MOPP4. This is also part of the conditioning process. It may also become necessary to eat
smaller portions and at more frequent intervals.

            (5) DOD Insect Repellent System. Proper implementation of the DOD Insect
Repellent System will provide protection from those insects and ticks that may be used as
biological agent vectors.

            (6) NBC Training. Training in an NBC environment is integrated into all areas
of unit training—individual and collective. Personnel learn, practice, and train to perform
individual NBC survival tasks. Leaders are directly responsible for reinforcing these tasks
through continuous training, thereby instilling individual confidence.

      c.    During-Attack Actions. If threat forces attack with biological agents, there may
be little or no warning. This will depend on the IPB assessment. Units automatically
assume MOPP4 to protect themselves against contamination when there are high-
probability indicators of an attack.

             (1) Biological-Attack Indicators. Biological agents may be disseminated as
aerosols, liquid droplets, or dry powder. Attacks with biological agents can be very subtle or
direct, if favorable weather conditions prevail. In nearly all circumstances, an individual
will not know a biological attack has occurred. Symptoms can appear from minutes to days
after an attack has occurred. Indicators may include—

                  •   Mysterious illness (many individuals sick for unknown reasons).

                  •   Large numbers of vectors, such as insects or unusual insects.

                  •   Large numbers of dead or strange-acting (wild and domestic) animals.




                                                                                            II-17
                • Mass casualties with flu-like symptoms—fever, sore throat, skin rash,
mental abnormalities, pneumonia, diarrhea, dysentery, hemorrhaging, or jaundice.

                 •   Artillery shells with less powerful explosions than high-explosive (HE)
rounds.

                 •   Aerial bombs that pop rather than explode.

                 •   Mist or fog sprayed by aircraft or aerosol generators.

                 •   Unexploded bomblets found in the area.

            (2) Immediate Actions. Assuming MOPP provides protection against biological
agents. However, an agent can gain entry through openings such as buttonholes; zipped
areas; stitching; poor sealing at ankles, wrists, and neck; or through minute pores in the
clothing fabric. Some toxins, however, require the same amount of protection as chemical
agents. Since no wide-scale immediate-warning, biological-agent detection device is fielded,
consider any unknown agent cloud as a sign of a biological attack and take the same actions
prescribed for a chemical attack. For COLPRO, personnel must be housed inside a shelter
with an efficient air filter system. Many buildings may be converted into temporary
shelters if cracks are carefully sealed and a CB filter system with a ventilating mechanism
is installed.

     d.    Postattack Actions. Actions after a biological attack include submitting NBC
reports, beginning post attack recovery, and other actions—such as taking samples,
identifying casualties by the symptoms they exhibit, and treating those symptoms. Early
recognition of symptoms and treatment is essential in trying to limit the effects.
Additionally, personnel should decontaminate immediately after an attack by using
decontamination kits or washing with soap and water.

Note: Postexposure chemoprophylaxis is essential for preventing anthrax. See FM 8-284,
Treatment of Biological Warfare Agent Casualties, for details.

           (1) Agent Exposure. It is necessary to isolate individuals showing symptoms of
contagious disease. This isolation helps prevent possible spread to others if the disease is
communicable. Treatment of biological-agent casualties requires medical assistance as soon
as possible. Further, symptoms associated with some toxins mimic other illness or
chemical-casualty symptoms. Agent symptoms may include—

                 •   Dizziness, mental confusion, or double or blurred vision.

                 •   Skin tingling, numbness, paralysis, or convulsions.

                 •   Formation of rashes or blisters.

                 •   Coughing.

                 •   Fever, aching muscles, fatigue, and difficulty in swallowing.

                 •   Nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea.


II-18
                    •    Bleeding from body openings or blood in urine, stool, or sputum (spit).

                    •    Shock (symptoms appear in minutes or hours after the toxin attack).

            (2) Unmasking Procedures. Unless prior warning is received from higher HQ to
mask in advance of the arrival of a biological attack, units will likely not be aware that they
have been exposed to a biological agent. However, if a unit has received prior warning of an
advancing cloud, there are procedures that can be implemented. For example, a biological
agent point detector can indicate (through its air-monitoring capability) when an aerosol
cloud has passed the point detector. Once that occurs, units use devices, such as hand-held
assays, to conduct testing to determine if positive test results are received. The report
information is passed to the NBC center (NBCC). The commander, with the advice from
the intelligence officer/noncommissioned officer (NCO), NBC officer/NCO, and the command
surgeon considers this data as well as data from other sources (e.g., weather, time of day,
threat, etc). Based on the multiple sources of data, the commander considers whether to
reduce protective levels.

          (3) Filter Exchange. When assessing filter exchange criteria several factors
must be considered. Exchange criteria for filters is based on service equipment directives or
when the following conditions are applicable:

                •       Physical damage occurs.

                •       Filters have become waterlogged or wet.

                •       High resistance to airflow is observed.

                •       Directed to exchange filters by higher HQ.

5.   Chemical Protection

      This paragraph discusses preattack, during-attack, and postattack aspects of
protection that must be accomplished in the event of a chemical attack. Protection against
chemical agents begins before an attack. Chemical agents can enter the body through the
skin, eyes, ingestion, and respiratory tract. Leaders conduct defensive planning against
possible chemical-agent attack. Units prepare SOPs that specify their chemical defense
techniques and procedures.

     a.   Background.

            (1) Chemical agents having military significance are categorized as nerve,
blister, blood, incapacitating, or choking agents. These chemical agents kill, seriously
injure, or incapacitate unprotected personnel. Chemical agents are classified according to
their physical states, physiological actions, and uses. The terms “persistent” and
“nonpersistent” describe the duration of chemical agents remaining in a targeted area.

         (2) Agents may exist as vapors, solids, liquids, or gases (depending on the
temperature); and they may cause casualties in multiple physical states. For example, an
agent may be disseminated as a liquid casualty hazard from a delivery vehicle, yet remain a


                                                                                             II-19
vapor hazard if the agent has high volatility or off-gases from a porous surface during high
temperatures. To a certain extent, the state in which an agent exists determines its use,
fate, and effects.

           (3) Personnel can be exposed to chemical warfare (CW) agents through
breathing (inhalation), the skin, and the eyes. The casualty-producing effects of chemical
agents can occur within seconds, minutes, or hours. For example, nerve agents are quick-
acting and can cause casualty-producing effects within minutes. Alternatively, blister
agents can take hours to cause their casualty-producing effects. Drink and food
contaminated by CW agents are also harmful. Other means of exposure are breaching of
the full-protective ensemble (e.g., from a tear caused by a munitions fragment) and/or
transfer from a contaminated surface during processing through a contamination control
area (CCA).

           (4) Personnel could potentially come into contact with casualty-producing
liquid agents prior to the agents absorbing into a nonporous surface. Alternatively, once a
liquid agent absorbs into a porous surface, such as concrete (e.g., during cool evening
temperatures), the agent may off-gas as a vapor during higher daytime temperatures and
also cause chemical-agent symptoms among exposed personnel. Furthermore, there are
other possible situations wherein casualty-producing effects of chemical agents can be
impacted by temperature and type of surface (for example, during cold weather, chemical
agent droplets are absorbed by an individual’s protective clothing, the agent off-gases
during the person’s entry into a shelter for warming, causing the individual to exhibit
chemical agent signs and symptoms).

          (5) Solid and liquid agents may provide an operational hazard for hours, days,
or months depending on the agent, weather conditions, and other factors.

        b.   Preattack Actions.

             (1)   Assess chemical threat, potential risk, and likelihood of attack.

             (2)   Implement coordinated chemical defense plan.

             (3)   Prepare to provide first aid for unit personnel.

             (4)   Determine and implement appropriate MOPP levels.

             (5)   Minimize skin exposure.

             (6)   Continue good hygiene and sanitation methods.

             (7)   Deploy and activate detectors.

             (8)   Designate and prepare shelters.

           (9) Watch for attack indicators (e.g., a chemical cloud, a distinctive odor, and
release of an agent).

             (10) Cover unprotected mission-essential equipment.


II-20
     c.   During-Attack Actions.

          (1) Give Attack Warnings. Detection and warning of the attack are critical to
the implementation of protective measures. The warning signal for the attack directs
personnel to take cover and use protective measures.

           (2) Take Cover. Taking cover protects personnel against blast, shrapnel, heat,
liquid, and particulate contamination. After taking cover, personnel don their masks and
other protective gear, as appropriate.

           (3) Use MOPP4. All personnel should assume MOPP4 (full IPE) in the absence
of any other information and remain in MOPP4 until directed to reduce their MOPP level.
The use of the MOPP ensemble could also be supplemented by the use of protective
clothing—such as wet-weather clothing; an air crewman’s cape; or the suit, contamination
avoidance, and liquid protective (SCALP). (See Appendix A for more information on these
items of IPE.)

     d.   Postattack Actions.

            (1) Begin post attack recovery. If an adversary uses an air-bursting chemical
munition, mission permitting, personnel will avoid outside activities to the maximum
extent possible after an attack during the chemical droplet fall phase. Additionally, the
chemical droplet fall phase could last up to approximately 60 minutes. The length of time
depends on factors such as meteorological data and the weapon’s height of burst. Outside
activities could result in erroneous initial reconnaissance results and unnecessarily
contaminated personnel and equipment.

           (2) Avoid potentially contaminated surfaces/areas. All personnel should
minimize contact with potentially contaminated surfaces until there are indications that
surface contamination is no longer a hazard.

          (3) Obtain and report observations or evidence of an attack. Personnel provide
reconnaissance and assessment information for all types of damage, hazards, and chemical
agents.

           (4) Survey, control, and mitigate health hazards (treat and evaluate
casualties). The HSS provides treatment for casualties according to established medical
protocols.

           (5) Adjust MOPP. Commanders should adjust MOPP to the lowest possible
level consistent with identified hazards.

          (6) Document exposure. Medical staffs should clearly document exposure in the
medical records of those personnel who have been exposed.

           (7) Sample, monitor, and analyze for residual hazard. Once the situation
permits, the detection efforts determine the extent and duration of the residual hazards.




                                                                                          II-21
           (8) Plan and implement decontamination and contamination containment
actions. These actions are planned and implemented to minimize the operational impacts of
contamination.

          (9) Conduct unmasking procedures (all-clear). Commanders should revert to an
appropriate MOPP level based on the current threat in conjunction with the all-clear signal.
Personnel engaged in passive-defense functions should repair and resupply defense
equipment in preparation for follow-on attacks. All personnel should return their IPE to a
ready status in anticipation of the next attack warning.

                (a) Selective Unmasking. Selective unmasking is an operational
precautionary procedure used to support mask removal decisions. The unmasking process
acknowledges detector limitations and requires one or more individuals to unmask for brief
periods while others observe them for agent effects. Do not perform selective unmasking if
agent detectors continue to detect an agent within the area or structure. Also recognize
that the recommended unmasking methodology should meet personnel safety requirements
and that accomplishing unmasking procedures does not guarantee the absence of low-level
exposure.

                 (b) Unmasking Procedures Using the M256-Series Chemical Detector Kit.
An M256-series chemical detector kit does not detect all agents. Therefore, consider also
using unmasking procedures listed below in subparagraph (c), even if the detector is
available. These procedures take approximately 15 minutes. After all tests with the kit,
including a check for liquid contamination, have been performed and the results are
negative, the senior person should select one or two individuals to start the unmasking
procedures. If possible, move to a shady place. Bright, direct sunlight can cause pupils in
the eyes to constrict, giving false signs of nerve agent exposure. The selected individuals
unmask for 5 minutes and then reseal and clear their masks. Observe them for 10 minutes.
If no symptoms appear, the commander/leader considers issuing the all-clear signal for
unmasking. Continue to watch the personnel for possible delayed symptoms. Always have
first aid treatment immediately available in case it is needed.

                 (c) Unmasking Procedures Without the M256-Series Chemical Detector
Kits. If an M256-series kit is not available, the unmasking procedures take at least 35
minutes. Find a shady area. Use M8/M9 paper to check the area for possible liquid
contamination. When a reasonable amount of time has passed after the attack, the senior
person should select one or two individuals. They take a deep breath, hold it, and break the
seal for 15 seconds, keeping their eyes wide open. They then clear and reseal their masks
and are observed for 10 minutes. If no symptoms appear, the selected individuals break the
seal of their mask, take two or three breaths (keeping their eyes wide open), and clear and
reseal their masks. Observe them for 10 minutes. If no symptoms appear, the selected
individuals unmask for 5 minutes and then remask. If no symptoms appear in 10 minutes
after remasking, the commander considers issuing a directive for an all-clear. This process
takes a minimum of 35 minutes. Leaders continue to observe the selected personnel in case
delayed symptoms develop.

                  (d) Personnel Displaying Symptoms. In both cases, if personnel display
symptoms of agent poisoning, ensure that first aid procedures are available and provided. If
an agent is still present, the senior person present must select one of the following options:


II-22
                      •   If possible, move to a new area and retest.

                      • If the mission dictates that movement cannot be conducted,
conduct a retest after 1 hour.

Note: Leaders remain aware that selected chemical agents (e.g., blister agents) may not
result in the onset of symptoms for several hours.

                 (e) Assessing Detector Information. Detector capabilities necessitate that
leaders analyze the situation to determine if it is safe to unmask after the detection
instruments or devices indicate negative results. This need for analysis exists because of
the potential presence of low-level vapors that, through their cumulative effect on the body,
may cause eye damage or more severe effects within minutes or hours. Analysis is required
even if the above-mentioned unmasking procedures are used. NBC personnel should utilize
service directives and materials to assist in this process. The key is the use of risk
assessment to balance force survivability and the mission and to acknowledge that different
agents dissipate at various rates from different surfaces. For example, the hazard time
lines associated with contaminated equipment may exceed those associated with soil and/or
concrete surfaces.

           (10) Chemical Filter Exchange. Filter exchange is another action that is based
on design, physical condition, climatic conditions, and the possible threat agent that could
be employed. Information in the following paragraphs addresses peacetime, transition-to-
war, and wartime exchange criteria.

Note: The information in this section is not meant to supersede other guidance contained in
service-specific TTP or technical publications.

                   (a) Peacetime Filter Exchange. When assessing filter exchange criteria,
several factors must be considered. Commanders and NBC personnel must monitor
replacement schedules for pieces of NBC equipment having filters. Peacetime exchange
criteria for all filters must occur when the following conditions are applicable:

                      •   Physical damage occurs.

                      •   Filters have become waterlogged/wet.

                      •   High resistance to airflow is observed.

                      •   Directed to exchange filters by higher HQ.

                      • Filters are listed as unserviceable in applicable supply bulletins
(SBs), technical orders (TOs), etc. Selected service directives, may indicate specific filter lot
numbers are unserviceable; however, if those filters are not clogged or damaged, they
should still be considered serviceable for peacetime applications.

                (b) Transition to War Filter Exchange. Commanders will determine when
their units should remove their training filters and replace them with filters from unit
contingency stocks. This guidance should be reflected in an SOP or an order. Factors for
filter exchange consideration are unit location, unit readiness/deployability alert status,


                                                                                             II-23
last filter exchange, threat, time availability, and stocks available. For example, a forward
deployed unit commander, based on an enemy chemical capability in the AO, directs (by
SOP) that his unit install its contingency filter set. Alternatively, a CONUS-based unit
commander determines that the basis for installing contingency filters would occur upon an
increase in unit alert status for deployment to an area with an NBC threat. Before
initiating filter exchange, leaders consider the implications for their units. Some
considerations are—

                     •   Mission. What is the unit mission?

                      • Enemy. What is the current NBC threat assessment? Is the unit
likely to be attacked on arrival in the operational area?

                     • Terrain and weather. Where should filters be exchanged—at the
home station, en route, or in the operational area?

                     • Time available. When should filters be exchanged? When will
there be adequate time to exchange filters?

                    •    Troops and support available. Are the right people available to
conduct the exchange?

                 (c) Wartime Filter Exchange. The decision to change filters is driven by
two considerations: the amount of chemical agent the filter has been exposed to and the
time the filter has been exposed to the atmosphere. These separate considerations are
based on the two mechanisms by which the filter provides protection from chemical agents.
For all agents, the filter uses mechanical filtration and absorption as the protection
mechanism. For blood agent cyanogen chloride (CK), the filter uses a chemical reaction. The
chemical reaction mechanism is degraded by prolonged exposure to CK. The absorption
capacity is degraded by exposure over time to air, particularly hot, humid air. Based on
these factors, the following filter change criteria apply:

Note: In an AO with no chemical attacks confirmed and no CK threat, filters should be
changed annually. In an AO with no chemical attacks confirmed but where a CK threat
exists, the filters should be changed according to guidance provided in Table II-5.

Note: Information in this table is applicable to USA units; other services follow directives as
prescribed in applicable TOs and TMs.

                     •   Physical damage occurs.

                     •   Filters have become waterlogged/wet.

                     •   High resistance to airflow observed.

                     •   When directed by higher authority.

                     •   For units that have received chemical attacks, change all filters
every 30 days.

6.      Collective Protection Operations

      COLPRO replaces neither MOPP gear nor the MOPP TTP. For example, the
ventilated-facepiece system enhances MOPP gear protection. Overpressure systems create
an overpressure environment. This changes the impact of the NBC threat and allows the
commander to order lower MOPP levels inside these facilities or systems. Commanders and
personnel should be familiar with several preattack, during-attack, and postattack actions
in the event of an NBC attack to make the use of available COLPRO systems more efficient
and effective.

   a.   Preattack. Before an NBC attack occurs, several actions should make the use of
COLPRO easier.

             (1)   Commanders should—

                    •   Determine the appropriate MOPP levels inside the facilities/systems.

                    •   Accomplish COLPRO planning.

                    •   Ensure that personnel are accounted for and briefed on the threat
situation.

             (2)   Individuals should—

                    •   Assume the appropriate MOPP level.

                    •   Check the protection system for proper operation.

                    •   Know the entry and exit procedures.

                    •   Accomplish the individual protective actions.

             (3)   The shelter attendants should—

                    •   Inspect and maintain the shelter filter system.

                    •   Inspect and maintain the communication system.

                    •   Know the entry and exit procedures.

        b.   During-Attack.

           (1)     Actions that should be taken include suspending or minimizing entry into
the shelter.

             (2)   The shelter attendants should—

                    •   Don masks and alert shelter occupants.

                    •   Aid in securing air lock doors.


II-26
                 •   Prevent unauthorized personnel from entering the shelter.

                • Conduct periodic tests for contamination. If entry from a
contaminated environment is mission-essential, internal monitoring becomes critical and
MOPP4 would be required if suitable CCA (personnel decontamination) activities cannot be
conducted.

                 •   Ensure adherence to prescribed entry and exit procedures.

                 •   Monitor the shelter interior periodically using detector/monitoring
equipment.

                  • Suspend “no mask” operations if a hazardous level of agent is detected
inside. Personnel should assume the appropriate MOPP level and consider whether to
continue to shelter in place or evacuate the shelter.

                • Proceed with unmasking risk assessment when detector/monitoring
equipment no longer indicates the presence of agents.

                 •   Know that further actions during an attack will depend on the type of
COLPRO.

     c.   Postattack Actions.

           (1) Vapor and liquid contamination hazard may remain for some time after an
attack. Personnel also take the following additional actions:

                 •   Ensure that contaminated items are not stowed in CPE.

                 •   Acquire decontamination support if required.

                 • Resupply expendables, such as IPE, mask and shelter filters, and
individual decontamination kits.

                  • Continue entry and exit procedures until 1 hour after detectors
indicate the absence of agent vapors outside the shelter.

                 •   Establish personnel decontamination sites.

                  • Resume preattack actions, but continue periodic monitoring of shelter
interior with detector/monitoring equipment.

          (2)    After an attack, the shelter attendants will—

                 •   Pass the all-clear signal to the shelter occupants when safe to do so.

                 •   Service the filter system, if needed.

                 •   Assist during entry and exit procedures.




                                                                                           II-27
                   •   Continue attendant duties.

7.      Toxic Industrial Material Protection

      US forces frequently operate in environments in which there are TIM, particularly
toxic industrial chemical (TIC) and toxic industrial biological (TIB) material, and/or toxic
industrial radiological (TIR) material. A number of these chemicals could interfere
significantly across the range of military operations. Release of TIC is most dangerous at
night because typical nighttime weather conditions produce high concentrations that
remain close to the ground for extended distances. TIM can have other significant hazards.
TIC are often corrosive and can damage eyes, skin, respiratory tract, and equipment. Many
TIM are flammable, explosive, or react violently with air or water. TIM can have both
short- and long-term health effects, ranging from short-term transient effects to long-term
disability to rapid death. Military protection, detection, and medical countermeasures are
not specifically designed for the hazards from TIM. Often there are no specific antidotes for
TIM. See Appendix E for information on the assessment of protective mask filter
performance against selected TIC.

         Self-protection is the key to successful response efforts. When personnel ensure
their self-protection, they can save lives, minimize the spread of contamination, and protect
property. Subsequently, units would likely isolate the area and deny entry except to
authorized and protected personnel. Personnel must remember that a TIM incident could
be a crime scene. As a potential crime scene, it is very important to preserve the evidence to
aid prosecuting the individual or individuals responsible for the act.

        a.   Preattack Actions.

           (1) General Planning. Before any operation, the response element should
develop an understanding of the potential hazards from TIM in the area of concern.
Further, information collection requirements that can support vulnerability analysis and
assessment during the planning process (deliberate or crisis action) include some of the
following key factors:

                 • Identifying all possible industrial plants, storage sites, and shipment
depots and pipelines.

                   •   Identifying TIM routinely produced, used, or processed in the area.

                 • Assessing the effects of the TIM release as a result of collateral
damage or an accident.

                   •   Assessing whether deliberate TIM release is realistic in this particular
situation.

                  • Identifying local hazard management procedures and civilian agencies
responsible for handling incidents.

                   •   Identifying local hazard identification labeling and placarding
systems.



II-28
                 •   Assessing the need for special detectors and modifications of detectors.

                 • Assessing the need for specialized protection equipment, such as self-
contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) or special, impermeable chemical suits.

           (2) TIM Evacuation Planning. When time and mission allow, evacuation is the
best protective response to a TIM hazard. Plan for in-place protection when evacuation
may cause greater risk than remaining in place. In-place protection may not be an option if
the TIM vapors are flammable, the hazard is persistent, or buildings cannot be closed
tightly.

          (3) Risk Assessment. Selected measures that support risk assessment include
securing key information, assessing risk, and conducting NBC defense actions.

                 (a) Each situation has special problems and considerations. During
planning, attempt to secure pertinent information involving production, storage facilities,
distribution, and transportation of TIM. As a minimum, obtain the type, quantity, and
specific risk from fire, explosion, toxicity, corrosive effects, and/or persistency of gas.
Sources for this information include unit intelligence personnel; appropriate scientific,
civilian industrial and CW treaty experts; safety reports; and materiel safety data sheets
(MSDSs) on the facility; international code markings on storage tanks; and local civilian
authorities who have emergency response procedures and resources.

                 (b) A thorough vulnerability analysis provides an initial estimate of the
threat and is the first step toward mitigating the operational effects of damage or
destruction of a TIM facility. Determining the TIM hazard/threat and possible
countermeasures in an AO is a primary responsibility of the medical and supporting
PVNTMED staff. They are supported by the NBC and civil affairs (CA) staffs.

                (c) Military protection and decontamination equipment was not designed
for handling TIC. For proper handling, protection, and hazard management information,
units seek guidance from their C2 element. Commanders also identify the local civilian
authorities that may have additional emergency response procedures and resources that
can be used.

                (d) Some plants, facilities, storage containers, or transport containers
may be identified by markers. These could take the form of international markers that are
diamond-shaped and contain information that can be used to identify the exact TIM.

                 (e) For firefighting or entering any enclosed space where there has been a
TIM or spill cleanup a SCBA must be used. The individual protective mask (NBC mask)
does not supply sufficient air or protection within the immediate hazard zone. TIM, such as
ammonia, may be present and the lack of oxygen will require the use of SCBA. The military
respirator should be used only for emergency protection against the immediate effects of a
TIM release and while evacuating the immediate hazard zone. Further, military CP suits
are not specifically designed for providing protection against TIC.

              (f) The most important action in case of massive TIC release is
immediate evacuation. The greatest risk from a large-scale TIC release occurs when



                                                                                         II-29
personnel are unable to escape the immediate area and are overcome. For detailed
information on these hazards, see the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health
(NIOSH), Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards; and/or Guide to Chemical Hazards; US
Department of Transportation, Emergency Response Guidebook; and FM 8-500, Hazardous
Materials Injuries: A Handbook for Prehospital Care.

                (g) When planning for operations in areas where TIM may be present, the
combatant and subordinate commanders include consideration of these potential hazards as
part of the IPB process. These hazards could occur from massive deliberate releases,
accidental release from industrial sites, or leaks from storage and transport containers.
Particular emphasis should be placed on those TIM that produces acute effects when
inhaled.

        b.   During-Attack Actions.

             (1)   TIC or TIB.

                   •        Alert higher, adjacent, and subordinate units.

                • Start monitoring with available detection devices, and ensure that
results are reported.

                   •       Assume MOPP4, and move to a safe distance as quickly as possible.

                   •       Establish a security zone around the area.

               • Evacuate casualties. Casualties should be considered as contaminated
and should be contained in one central location. Initiate emergency decontamination of
personnel.

                   •       Identify witnesses for questioning.

                   •       Establish a downwind hazard zone.

             (2)   TIR.

                       •    Take protective action.

                       •    Assess casualties and damage.

                       •    Identify potential locations of TIR materials.

                       •    Begin continuous monitoring and report the arrival of fallout.

                 • Protect personnel and equipment from the effects of fallout and fires
that may be started.

                       •    Report increase, decrease, or peak dose rates. Report the completion of
fallout.



II-30
                   • Receive an NBC 2 nuclear report from higher HQ. Prepare a
simplified fallout prediction and inform the commander.

     c.   Postattack Actions.

          •   Control the situation.

          •   Protect yourself.

          •   Prevent the situation from claiming more casualties.

          •   Rescue, protect, and treat victims.

          •   Decontaminate exposed victims, and minimize the spread of contamination.

          •   Conduct early hazard identification.

          •   Preserve evidence per the SOP.

          •   Follow emergency response SOPs and operation plans (OPLANs).

          •   Coordinate with local, state, federal, and HN agencies as required.




                                                                                    II-31
                                        Chapter III

                 OPERATIONS IN UNIQUE ENVIRONMENTS



1.   Background

      Weather and terrain and how they affect the need for NBC protection must receive
special consideration. Certain weather conditions will greatly influence the use of NBC
weapons. Likewise, different types of terrain will alter the effects of NBC weapons. Also,
the type of operation can directly bear on the need for NBC protection. This chapter
addresses cold weather, desert, jungle, mountain, urban, and littoral operations.

2.   Cold Weather

     Cold weather environments create unique and diverse conditions that must be
overcome to accomplish an assigned mission in an NBC environment.

     a.   Nuclear Defense Considerations.

          (1) Weapons Effects. The winter environment influences the effects of a
nuclear detonation regarding blast, thermal, and radiation effects.

                (a) Blast Effects. At subzero temperatures, the radius of damage to
material targets can increase as much as 20 percent. Tundra, irregular terrain features,
and broken ice caps will break up the pressure wave and, thereby, reduce the effects of this
powerful wave. Blast waves can drastically interfere with movement by breaking up ice
covers and causing thaws, triggering possible avalanches in mountainous areas. Avoid
avalanche-prone areas after the blast. Avalanches can be triggered up to 30 kilometers
away, and may cause massive flooding in valleys due to the instability caused by the blast
effects.

                  (b) Thermal Effects. Ice and snow have a high reflectivity. This may
increase the minimum safe distance (MSD) as much as 50 percent for unwarned personnel.
This reflectivity may increase the number of personnel whose vision is affected by the
brilliant flash or light dazzle, especially at night. Cold temperatures reduce thermal effects
on materials by reducing the possible heat signature. Snow, ice, and even frost coverings on
combustible materials greatly reduce the tendency of materials to catch fire. However, this
thermal effect will dry out exposed tundra areas and grass fires may result. Avoid
avalanche-prone areas after the blast. Avalanches can be triggered up to 30 kilometers
away due to the rapid warming and instability caused by the thermal effects.

                (c) Radiation Effects. The number of passable roadways is limited by
cold-weather conditions, and radiological contamination on roadways may further restrict
resupply and mobility. Seasonal, high winds in the arctic may present problems when
predicting radiological contamination and crossing contaminated areas.




                                                                                             III-1
             (2)   Individual Protective Measures.

                 (a) At low temperatures, land forces operating in a field environment are
particularly vulnerable to the effects produced by a nuclear detonation because of the
difficulty in preparing fighting positions and underground fortifications for protection.
Shelters and fortifications constructed from snow and ice provide some protection and,
wherever possible, should be constructed to take maximum advantage of the additional
protection provided by natural terrain features.

                 (b) Snow and ice, although not as effective as earth in reducing radiation
hazards, are readily available and can be used to provide shielding against radiation
effects. Loose snow falling on a contaminated area will have a half-thickness of about 60
centimeters (24 inches), and 30 centimeters (12 inches) of hard-packed snow will reduce the
original value by half.

Note: Half-thickness is the thickness of material required to reduce the original radiation
level (reading) to half its value.

               (c) Cold weather clothing (white outer shell) provides an advantage of low
absorption properties, thereby reducing the thermal effects.

             (3)   Monitor and Survey Operations.

               (a) High winds will extend contamination zones, creating a problem for
monitor and survey operations. Aerial survey is a practical method in extreme cold weather
areas, depending on the operating altitude and environmental conditions.

                (b) Hot spots or areas of concentrated accumulation of radiological
contamination may occur in areas of heavy snow and snowdrifts. These areas need special
attention during survey operations.

                (c) Radiac instruments (used to detect, survey, and monitor radiological
hazards) should be kept warm until used to ensure maximum efficiency. (Refer to the
appropriate technical publication for operating radiac systems in cold weather
environments.)

          (4) Decontamination Operations. Due to the freezing point of water (32 degrees
Fahrenheit [F]), decontaminate radioactive fallout on vehicles by brushing with brooms or
tree branches. Since radioactive effects (fallout) are removed from the items and not
neutralized, transfer of contamination occurs.

        b.   Biological Defense Considerations.

            (1) Field Behavior of Agents. BW in the arctic is a possibility, and biological
agents are effective in cold weather environments (with few exceptions). Most vectors
(infected insects) will not survive the extreme environmental conditions, and it is more
difficult to aerosolize live biological agents in freezing temperatures. Toxins, on the other
hand, are less susceptible to the cold. At these temperatures spore-forming bacteria and
certain viruses survive and remain dormant. Upon warming, they become an active hazard
to personnel. Temperature inversions that exist over snowfields tend to prolong the


III-2
integrity of an aerosolized biological cloud. Thus, it disperses more slowly and, therefore,
remains a threat for a longer period.

           (2) Individual Protective Measures. Personnel are more susceptible to
biological agents in arctic environments, mainly due to the rapid rate that diseases can
spread in the crowded warming areas and the difficulty in maintaining an adequate intake
of food and water (calorie intake increases due to extreme physical demands), getting
adequate rest, and practicing good hygiene. Enemy forces will be more likely to target food
and water sources due to the difficulty in resupply and the reliance on these assets in cold
weather.

     c.    Chemical Defense Considerations.

           (1) Chemical Agents. In arctic conditions, chemical agents act differently
because of their different physical properties but they are primarily more persistent.

                 (a) Blister Agents. Some forms of blister agents are ineffective as casualty
producers because the ambient temperature could be well below their normal freezing
points. This is not true for all blister agents, some of which can be effective as harassing or
casualty-producing agents.

                (b) Nerve Agents. Low levels of contamination may remain at low
temperatures for hours or days. In severely cold conditions, nerve agents will remain liquid
and can be absorbed through normal, cold-weather clothing. However, it should be noted
that agent data indicates that liquid absorption into soil and concrete was not significantly
affected by temperature and that snow absorbed agents within minutes, to the point that
less than 2 percent of the agent remained as a pickup/transfer hazard.

               (c) Blood and Choking Agents. Blood and choking agents remain
extremely hazardous and nonpersistent throughout the low-temperature ranges.

           (2) Individual Protective Measures. With the addition of chemical protective
clothing, the cold-weather clothing ensemble increases the risk of heat casualties and
degrades unit performance. Leaders will need to capitalize on MOPP analysis, risk
assessment, and METT-T in order to determine the recommended protection requirements.
Grass is more effective as a transfer hazard than snow. As agents transition from a solid to
a vapor state in heated shelters, tents, or vehicles, a hazard can be created. Spring melt-off
may also spread contamination beyond its original boundaries.

                 (a) Protective masks. Always refer to the appropriate technical
publications for the IPE to obtain the proper procedures for wearing the IPE during
operations in cold-weather environments. When donning the protective mask in arctic
conditions, personnel should stop breathing, remove the mask from under the parka,
remove the gloves or mittens (lower the parka hood, and don and clear the mask according
to the direction of the leader). The following additional guidance provides quick tips for
leaders to use as a guide when assisting their personnel before, during, and after operations
in cold-weather environments during NBC events:




                                                                                           III-3
                       • Use neutral or gray eyelens to prevent snow blindness and the
fogging of field protective eyelenses.

                      • Use tape on outserts so that only slits are left, if neutral or gray
outserts are not available.

                     • Fill canteens to three-fourths full to prevent the canteen from
bursting should the water freeze.

                      •   Blow remaining water out of the drinking tube to prevent ice from
forming.

                      •   Exhale steadily and slowly to try to prevent frosting of the
eyelenses.

                     • Wear the mask carrier in a position that permits maximum
mobility (see approved service and technical bulletins).

                     • Use a small towel or cloth to wipe the inside of the mask after
removal to prevent ice formation.

                 (b) Chemical Protective (CP) Clothing. The current CP clothing issued to
the armed forces will not be adversely affected by cold temperatures. Based on METT-T and
risk assessment, leaders will need to establish whether protective clothing is worn as an
outer layer (over extreme cold-weather clothing system [ECWCS]) or as an undergarment
(under ECWCS). The ECWCS will provide only marginal protection in a chemical
environment. Further, CP clothing is neither waterproof nor water-resistant, which will
affect the leader’s assessment during his METT-T evaluation. This consideration will also
impact on how the ensemble is worn (e.g., under the ECWCS with the white parka worn as
an exterior layer). The ECWCS includes a parka, trousers, mittens with inserts, gloves with
inserts, vapor barrier (VB) boots, baliklavas (a hood), a watch cap, and gaiters. The
wearing of the ECWCS also impacts the work/rest cycles assigned by the unit.

                 (c) Chemical Protective Overboots. The CP overboots do not fit over the
cold-weather VB boots. The CP overboots can fit over the ski march boots, but they
interfere with the ski bindings. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 120 ski
binding can cut through an overboot at the toe plate, contaminating the leather boot inside.
During cold weather operations, the VB boots provide adequate protection when worn in
conjunction with CP clothing. The VB boots are double-layered, with an air pocket between
layers and natural rubber.

                  (d) Chemical Protective Gloves. Normal procedures when donning the CP
gloves, are to first put on the cotton liners and then the rubber gloves. During winter
operations in a chemical environment, use the wool glove liners (part of the black leather
glove set) under the butyl rubber gloves to absorb and wipe away perspiration from hand
surfaces. A proper glove fit is required to preclude restricting blood circulation and cold
weather injury. In extreme cold environments, the arctic mittens should be worn over the
rubber gloves to provide warmth. Decontamination of cold-weather mittens (if
contaminated) may be impractical and, hence, considered as a combat loss.



III-4
                 (e) Nerve Agent Antidote Kit (NAAK). Care must be taken when using
the NAAK to ensure that it penetrates through winter clothing to the muscle. NAAKs are
subject to freezing at about the same temperature as water. Therefore, when the
temperature is below freezing, the NAAK should be protected against freezing.
Autoinjectors are normally carried in the protective mask carrier. When the temperature is
below freezing, the injectors should be carried in an inside pocket close to the body. Should
the NAAK become frozen, it can be thawed out and used. Personnel should also ensure that
there is no transfer of contamination when the NAAK is placed into or withdrawn from an
inside pocket.

                 (f) Antidote Treatment, Nerve Agent Autoinjector (ATNAA) System.
Arctic weather affects the ATNAA. When the temperature dips below freezing, the ATNAA
should be protected by removing it from the protective mask carrier and placing it in an
inside pocket close to the body. Keep it as close to body temperature as possible. This
precludes the danger of severe muscle spasms and/or shock from injecting an extremely cold
liquid into a muscle. If the ATNAA is allowed to freeze, it cannot be used until it is thawed.
In addition, protect the ATNAA from freezing during transit, storage, and resupply
operations. Care must be taken when using the ATNAA to ensure that it penetrates
through winter clothing to the muscle.

            (3) Monitor and Survey Operations. Toxic chemicals react differently at
extremely low temperatures. Even during cold temperatures, chemical-agent vapors can
still be present, and the concentration would be below the detector threshold level. Refer to
the appropriate technical publication for equipment operation during cold weather, and
monitor and survey operations.

                 (a) M256Al Chemical-Agent Detector Kit. Arctic weather affects the kit.
When temperature is -15 degrees F (-21 degrees Celsius [C]) or below, the kit can give
inaccurate indications. Solutions in the capsules freeze; and the solutions will not work,
even if they are reheated. In addition, it is difficult (or sometimes impossible) for the heat
tabs to heat the enzyme window to a reaction temperature. Take care to keep the kit at a
temperature above freezing. However, do not place the kit directly on a source of heat, such
as a vehicle heater. If possible, warm it with body heat by placing it inside the parka. A
system of identifying a sample of suspected agent is to collect the suspected agent and place
it on M8 or M9 paper. Once collected, the M8 or M9 paper is warmed and covered in a box
or can with the M256A1 kit. This will heat both the suspected agent and the kit sufficiently
to enable identification with the kit. Personnel can place samples into empty ammunition
cans and apply external heat to cause agent off-gassing. The external heat source may be a
small fire or a heat tab.

                (b) Chemical-Agent Monitor (CAM) and Improved CAM (ICAM). At lower
temperatures, chemical agents such as blister agents, become more persistent or even
freeze, and reduce the amount of vapor present for the CAM or ICAM to detect. Cold
weather also shortens battery life. Refer to the appropriate technical publication for
operating the ICAM/CAM in cold-weather environments.

                 (c) M8 and M9 Detector Paper. M8 and M9 papers are not specifically
limited in the cold, but they can detect only liquid agents. If the specific substance is
thickened or frozen, a sample can be collected with a stick or a scraper and wiped onto a


                                                                                            III-5
sheet of M8 or M9 paper. Place the sample on a heated surface, such as the hood of an
operating vehicle, the top of a power generator, or a burning heat tab under a canteen cup,
to stimulate thawing of the suspected agent so that identification is expedited. Because of
the possibility of off-gassing, this procedure must not be performed inside a heated vehicle
or tent.

          (4) Decontamination Operations. Refer to the appropriate technical and
service publications for decontamination considerations and guidance regarding cold-
weather environments.

                 (a) Equipment Decontamination. The use of water or 5 percent
hypochlorite solution for decontamination will be limited during cold-weather operations
due in part to the freezing point of water (32 degrees F). Alternatively, a dry mix of super
tropical bleach (STB) or high-test hypochlorite (HTH) (two parts STB/HTH to three parts
earth or snow) can be used. This method may require several applications at low
temperatures. Shovel the dry mix onto the contaminated surfaces or place it in sandbags
and dust it onto surfaces. After decontaminating, remove any residual elements of the dry
mix by brushing, scraping, or removing it with uncontaminated earth or snow. These
decontaminants are corrosive to metals and personnel must wear MOPP gear. Additionally,
sorbent decontamination is also limited during cold weather. Sorbent decontamination
systems are based on liquid absorption, and frozen agents cannot be absorbed.

                 (b) Personnel Decontamination. Time factors regarding MOPP exchange
or detailed troop decontamination (DTD) should be expanded with regard to cold-weather
conditions and the addition of the ECWCS. For example, the time required to doff the
ECWCS, the white parka, and the trousers will add more time to the MOPP exchange
process. Additionally, more time will be needed if the VB boots require decontamination.

           (5) COLPRO. For COLPRO, chemical hazards present additional challenges.
Cold-weather operations use heated shelters, and shelters may or may not have COLPRO.
However, fluctuations in pressure may occur when the system is exposed to high winds. In
cold environments, indirect chemical-vapor absorption presents the greatest problem
during shelter entry and exit operations. For this reason, it is important to have a detection
capability in the shelter itself. If an agent is detected, personnel in the shelter will
immediately mask. The personnel inside the shelter will be monitored to identify who
brought in the contamination. Once identification has been made, the personnel exit and
the shelter is then immediately purged. If follow-on detection proves negative, personnel
may resume entry and exit procedures. Additionally, CP systems used as an MTF cannot
be easily evacuated. Therefore, contaminated personnel must not be allowed entry.




III-6
3.   Desert

     Desert operations present many varying problems. Desert daytime temperatures can
vary from 90 to 125 degrees F (32 to 52 degrees C). An unstable temperature gradient
results, and this is not particularly favorable to NBC attacks. However, with nightfall, the
desert cools rapidly, and a stable temperature gradient results. A possibility of night or
early morning attacks must be considered in all planning of desert operations. Additionally,
planners understand that hot temperatures can adversely impact NBC defense
equipment/supplies during transit or storage. For information on specific items, check the
appropriate TOs and TMs.

      a.   Nuclear. Nuclear defense planning is generally much the same in a desert as in
other areas, with exceptions. The lack of vegetation and permanent fixtures, such as forests
and buildings, make it necessary to consider construction of fortifications. Construction
may be difficult because of sand inconsistencies; but sand, in combination with sandbags,
will give additional protection from radiation exposure. Blowing winds and sands can also
produce widespread areas of radiological contamination.

      b.    Biological. Most aerosolized, live biological agents, except for a few, are
ineffective weapons in the high temperatures of desert areas. An exception is spore-forming
biological agents. This is a result of low humidity and the ultraviolet radiation of direct
sunlight. Personnel crossing or occupying desert terrain face little danger from long-term,
live biological contamination except for spore-forming agents; however, because of favorable
night conditions, a covert aerosolized attack could occur. Toxins are resistant to this harsh
environment and could be employed in the same way as chemical agents.

     c.   Chemical.

          (1) Chemical agents can be used in point or on-target attacks. This type of
attack can be used at high temperatures because of rapid agent evaporation. For example,
with a neutral temperature gradient, 90 degrees F (32 degrees C) temperature, and light
wind, sarin (GB) evaporates rapidly.

           (2) Desert soil may be very porous. For example, an attack with an
unthickened liquid agent may occur in support of a predawn attack. Soil soaks up the
agent. When the sun rises, it begins to heat the surface. The agent evaporates and can
create a vapor hazard.

           (3) A nonpersistent agent attack is unlikely during daylight hours. Weather
conditions may rapidly dissipate any agent. Night brings about a reversal of weather
conditions and creates ideal conditions for an attack. At night, agents linger and settle into
low areas, such as fighting positions.

           (4) In planning for defense, plan any strenuous activity for the nighttime
hours. This will reduce the heat stress caused by wearing MOPP gear. Take care to ensure
that sleeping personnel are masked (if appropriate). Also, see that they are checked
periodically to ensure that mask seals are not broken. An attack is more likely to occur at




                                                                                           III-7
night than during the day. Use the buddy system or have the guards check personnel
during their rounds. The unit SOP must address this subject.

4.      Jungle

      Tropical climates require the highest degree of individual discipline and conditioning
to maintain effective NBC defense readiness. Dominating climatic features of jungle areas
are, constant high temperatures, heavy rainfall, and very high humidity. In thick jungle,
there is usually little or no wind, and the canopy blocks much of the sunlight from the
ground. Commanders must expect and plan for a rapid decrease in unit efficiency. They
must also expect heat casualties. In addition, they must ensure that special precautions are
taken to maintain unit NBC defensive equipment in usable condition. The rapid mildew,
dry rot, and rust inherent in jungle areas make this requirement necessary.

     a.    Nuclear. Dense vegetation has little influence on the initial effects of nuclear
detonations, except that the heavy canopy provides some protection against thermal
radiation. The blast wave creates extensive tree blowdown and missile effects. Some falling
particles are retained by the jungle canopy, and reduced radiation hazards may result.
Subsequent rains, however, will wash these particles to the ground. Particles will
concentrate in water collection areas and produce radiation hot spots.

     b.    Biological. Jungles provide excellent conditions for threat use of live biological
agents. Warm temperatures, high humidity, and protection from sunlight all aid the
survivability of disease-causing microorganisms. Low wind speeds and jungle growth limit
downwind hazards. Strict adherence to field sanitation procedures (especially vector and
rodent control), the use of skin and clothing repellents, and the use of permethrin-treated
bed nets are essential in jungles. These procedures will help control the naturally occurring
diseases that abound. Personnel should mask and roll down sleeves to cover exposed skin
and prevent possible contact with live biological agents.

      c.    Chemical. Chemical agents used in jungle areas can cause extreme problems for
friendly forces. Persistent agents delivered by artillery shells and aircraft bombs may
penetrate the canopy before dissemination. These agents can remain effective on jungle
floors for extremely long periods. High temperatures can increase vapor hazards from liquid
agents. Nonpersistent agent vapors hang suspended in the air for extended periods because
of low wind speeds. However, these wind speeds minimize downwind vapor hazards.
Chemical agents employed in jungle areas make MOPP gear necessary for ground
operations. However, high temperatures and humidity combined with the heat-loading
characteristics of MOPP gear increases performance degradation.

5.      Mountains

      Terrain and weather in mountainous areas dictate a requirement for a high degree of
NBC defense preparedness. Rugged terrain limits the employment of large forces. Adjacent
units may not be able to provide mutual support. Also, there may be reduced logistical
support and difficulty in achieving rapid maneuver. In these circumstances, small US units
can impede, harass, or canalize numerically superior threat forces. The intention is to
dissipate threat strength and compel threat forces to fight a decisive battle under



III-8
unfavorable circumstances. Mountain warfare requires friendly units to be almost
completely self-sufficient in NBC protection.

     a.    Nuclear. Nuclear targeting in mountainous areas is easier than in flat terrain.
The reasons are the lack of roads and trails and the slow speed at which personnel must
move. Preparing fighting positions and building other protective shelters are difficult in
rocky or frozen ground. Improvised shelters built of snow, ice, or rocks may be the only
possible protection. Because of rapidly changing wind patterns, radiological contamination
deposit may be very erratic. Hot spots may occur far from the point of detonation, and low
intensity areas may occur very near it. Limited mobility makes radiological surveys on the
ground difficult, and the difficulty of maintaining a constant flight altitude makes air
surveys highly inaccurate. Natural shelters provide some protection from nuclear effects
and radiological contamination. These natural shelters include caves, ravines, and cliffs.
Clear mountain air extends the range of casualty-producing thermal effects. Added clothing
required by cool mountain temperatures, however, reduces casualties from these effects.
Units operating under nuclear warfare conditions should also carefully select positions
where they will not be hit or trapped by avalanches or rock/mud slides.

    b.   Biological. Defense against biological agents does not differ in principle in
mountains from that in flat terrain.

     c.   Chemical. Aerial delivery could be a likely means of chemical munitions
employment in mountain warfare. Personnel should be constantly alert for aerial strikes,
and they should take protective actions immediately. Defense against chemical attacks in
mountains is similar to that in flat terrain; however, the compartmentalization and
micrometeorological effects in mountainous terrain will affect the clouds’ downwind travel.
For example, the wind could be blowing in different directions in adjacent valleys.
Consequently, a chemical strike in one valley may not affect units in an adjoining valley.

6.   Urban Areas

      To plan NBC defense, commanders must be familiar with how urban terrain will
affect their mission in an NBC environment. For example, the TIM density will likely
increase in an urban area, the downwind transport of aerosols will be influenced by the
unique micrometeorological considerations in urban terrain (e.g., increased thermal buildup
and thermal islands), and there will be a larger number of noncombatants.

      a.   Nuclear. Without additional preparation, unreinforced buildings give inadequate
shelter from a nuclear blast. If used correctly, ground floors and basements of steel or
reinforced concrete offer excellent protection from most effects except overpressure.
Personnel should avoid windows because of possible injuries from flying debris and glass.
Personnel also may receive severe burns through openings facing ground zero (GZ). Storm
drains and subway tunnels are readily available in most urban areas. These provide better
protection than ground level buildings. Personnel should not use structures of wood or
other flammable materials because they could burst into flames. Buildings do provide a
measure of protection against radiological contamination; and personnel may travel
through buildings, sewers, and tunnels. However, they should consider the dangers of
collapse because of blast.




                                                                                         III-9
     b.    Biological. Buildings and other urban structures can provide some immediate
protection from direct spray. However, the stable environment of these structures may
increase persistency of biological agents. Toxins are very effective in an urban environment,
and personnel should take the same precautions prescribed for chemical agents. Pound for
pound, biological agents are more toxic than chemical agents, and agent effects are
especially magnified in an enclosed area. Covert operations are particularly well-suited for
urban terrain. Existing water and food supplies are prime targets. Personal hygiene
becomes increasingly important. The urban terrain increases the potential for person-to-
person transmission of contagious biological agents. Commanders must establish and
consistently enforce sanitary and personal hygiene measures, including immunizations.
They must also ensure that personnel drink safe water and must never assume that
hydrant water is safe.

      c.    Chemical. Urban structures can protect against spray attacks, but this exchange
for overhead cover creates other problems. Generally, chemical agents tend to find and stay
in low areas, such as those found in urban locations such as basements, sewers, and
subway tunnels. Personnel should avoid these low areas. Stay times of agents, such as GB,
greatly increase when agents settle in these areas. Once an attack occurs, detection of
chemical contamination becomes very important. Personnel must thoroughly check areas
before attempting to occupy or traverse them. Additionally, chemical-agent concentrations
will generally decrease with an increase in structure height, and personnel on the higher
stories of a tall building should experience lower agent concentrations.

7.       Littoral Environments

      During operations at the sea-land interface, multiple considerations impact NBC
defense operations. For example, land and sea breezes occur almost daily in tropical and
midlatitude regions on the coasts of all islands and continents. This occurs because the land
cools and heats more rapidly than the adjacent water. Therefore, the commander must be
concerned about potential offshore CB agent threat.

      a.    Nuclear. The blast effects from a nuclear detonation can cause significant
damage to military operations ashore and afloat. Additionally, ships could be damaged by
tidal surges caused by such an attack. Reflective surfaces, such as water, can also enhance
weapon thermal effects. Residual contamination can contaminate and hinder critical
logistics over-the-shore (LOTS) operations.

     b.    Biological. During littoral operations, meteorological conditions can be especially
favorable for use of biological agents. Offshore line release of a biological agent can cover
larger areas. Biological-agent surveillance assets monitor for the presence of biological
agents in the littoral environment. Whether the littoral environment is in an extreme
temperate (cold or hot) climatic zone, a biological-agent aerosol can cause casualty-
producing effects.

      c.    Chemical. Blister agents (especially mustards) may cause casualty-producing
effects if personnel encounter them in salt or fresh water. Generally, water will cause some
blister agents to hydrolyze; however, the temperature and relative acidity or basal content
of the water will affect the rate of hydrolysis. Further, littoral operations in tropical areas




III-10
(i.e., high temperatures and humidity) can also enhance the casualty-producing effects of
chemical agents.




                                                                                       III-11
                                            Chapter IV

       MISSION-ORIENTED PROTECTIVE POSTURE ANALYSIS


1.   Background

     This chapter addresses the guidance for determining appropriate levels of protection
in an NBC environment (MOPP analysis) and MOPP levels.

2.   Analysis

      During the preattack phase, NBC personnel consider METT-T, and related
information to provide recommendations on protection requirements. Medical personnel
also provide recommendations to ensure safe and sustained operations under various
climatic conditions. The commander and staff should develop standard responses and COA
for each projected mission. After the attack, NBC personnel will use the information
collected to identify the type of agent used, the likely duration of exposure, and minimum
protection requirements. Leaders know they cannot expect the same work rates in MOPP4
as they achieved in MOPP0. They reevaluate their ability to meet mission requirements
and communicate changes to their forces. Should they neglect to provide additional
resources or adjust task completion times, first-line supervisors may assume the mission is
critical and try to maintain the original time lines. Depending on the task and climate, the
short- and long-range consequences to personnel may range from insignificant (cool or mild)
to catastrophic (hot and dry). MOPP reduction decisions are also among the most difficult to
make because of the many considerations that affect the final decision. Commanders must
evaluate the situation from both the FP and the mission perspectives. Factors include the
criticality of the current mission, potential effects of personnel exposure, and the impact on
the casualty care system. The commander and staff can then determine what follow-on
COAs to employ. Leaders determine the appropriate MOPP level by assessing METT-T
factors and weighing the impact of increased levels of protection (reducing the risk of CB
agent exposure and the increased risk of heat strain as protection levels increase) (see
Table IV-1).

                                   Table IV-1. MOPP Analysis
                    • MOPP analysis considers:
                        • Mission.
                        • Enemy.
                        • Time available.
                        • Troops and support available.
                        • Terrain and weather.
                    •   MOPP analysis provides recommended MOPP levels.




                                                                                          IV-1
     a.     Mission. To support analyzing mission factors, the following questions can be
asked:

            •   What is the mission?

            •   What additional protection (such as COLPRO) is available?

          • How physically and mentally demanding is the mission that must be
performed (i.e., work intensity)?

            •   How quickly must the mission be accomplished?

            •   What is the expected duration of the mission and likely follow-on missions?

            •   Are adequate food and water supplies available?

     b.   Enemy (Threat). The following questions can be asked to support threat
considerations:

            •   Is an attack probable?

            •   Is an attack imminent or in progress?

            •   Is the immediate AO contaminated once the attack is over?

            •   What are the likely targets, threat agents, and warning times?

      c.   Terrain and Weather. To support analyzing terrain and weather factors, the
following questions can be asked:

            •   What is the ambient air temperature? What is the humidity?

            •   What is the wet-bulb, globe temperature (WBGT) index reading for the unit’s
AO?

            •   Is it cloudy, sunny, or windy?

            •   Is the terrain sandy, mountainous, or marshy?

      d.    Troops and Support Available. The following considerations could impact this
factor:

            •   How many personnel are available?

            •   What IPE do the personnel possess?

            •   What is the training status of available personnel?

       e.   Time Available. To support this factor, the following considerations can apply:




IV-2
          •   What is the time of day (or night) for completion of the mission?

          •   How much time is available for completion of the task?

          •   Can completion of the task be delayed?

Note: Guidance for the prevention of heat injury and illness can be based on WBGT
readings. The WBGT reading provides a single measure of the major determinants of
environmental heat stress (e.g., air temperature, wind speed, solar load, and humidity).
Although the WBGT provides an adequate representation of the heat stress under most
conditions, it is not perfect and should be interpreted as approximate guidance. For
instance, it is not optimized for conditions commonly seen in environmental extremes, such
as the desert. Guidance based on the WBGT is appropriate only for personnel who are fully
acclimatized, optimally conditioned, hydrated, and rested. Additionally, WBGT guidelines
do not accurately forecast injury/illness rates under conditions of lower temperatures and
high humidity, such as may be experienced in the early morning hours. Humidity levels
over 75 percent substantially increase the risk of heat injury under all work conditions.

Note: See Appendix C and FM 21-10, Field Hygiene and Sanitation, for detailed
information on human factors effects that can be caused by the wearing of MOPP gear.
Appendix C also provides information on suggested work/rest cycles while wearing MOPP
gear.

      f.   Preattack, During-Attack, Postattack. MOPP analysis points of emphasis will
likely vary during preattack, during-attack, and postattack phases. For example—

          • During preattack preparation, MOPP analysis may focus on enemy intent
and the probability of attack.

           • During an attack, MOPP analysis may focus on the mission and what the
impact of increased protection measures will have on the mission.

         • During postattack situations, MOPP analysis will likely focus on continuing
assessment of the hazard and how long the protection level will need to be sustained.

3.   Guidance

    Leaders apply mission, environmental, and NBC threat information to help determine
what MOPP level is appropriate for the unit’s situation.

      a.   Higher HQ (i.e., wing/corps/group/JTF) provides directives to subordinate
elements that will include a MOPP level. Within the constraints of service directives,
subordinate units apply flexibility and initiative to this guidance to account for local
conditions. Failure to do this exposes units to far greater hazards in the form of heat
casualties, direct fire losses, and mission failures. The following paragraphs provide
instructions for applying the guidance offered by higher HQ. Once MOPP levels are
established by higher HQ, subordinate units may not downgrade from this level except for
the following reasons:




                                                                                       IV-3
          • Units may temporarily reduce MOPP levels, consistent with the risk,to
conduct decontamination operations (such as MOPP gear exchange).

            • Personnel inside enclosures may reduce MOPP level at the discretion of the
section/flight/platoon leader or higher commander. The enclosure need not be airtight but
should be capable of protecting against the initial liquid hazard.

      b.    Land forces may make decisions on increasing or modifying MOPP posture at the
tactical level (i.e., squad and platoon level). Small units (like platoons) frequently conduct
independent operations; therefore, the unit leader’s training and experience are essential to
successful operations under NBC conditions. Directives received by small tactical units
should also indicate a minimum MOPP level and, if needed, a percentage of personnel
masked. In some cases the guidance received by battalion or equivalent will be passed
without change down to team/section/squad level.

4.     Levels

       In confronting an NBC threat, the MOPP analysis process can be used to help develop
protection levels (controls). The MOPP analysis process can be used as a tool to support
determining the appropriate protective posture, estimating unit/personnel effectiveness
(e.g., mission degradation), estimating additional logistics requirements (e.g., water
resupply, and IPE replenishment), and assessing/weighing the tradeoffs between agent
exposures versus degraded performance (e.g., wearing of MOPP4).

       a.   Standard MOPP.

           (1) MOPP Levels. Leaders are familiar with standard MOPP levels;
familiarity with these levels aids in making rapid and educated decisions. Standardized
MOPP levels allow leaders to increase or decrease levels of protection through the use of
techniques such as readily understood prowords. Leaders determine which protective
posture their subordinate units will assume (see Tables IV-2 through IV-6 [pages IV-5
through IV-9]) and then direct their units to assume that MOPP level. Leaders are also
aware that the shipboard application of MOPP level will vary from ground force MOPP (see
Table IV-7 [page IV-10] for the differences). The commander or leader directive also can
include, based on the threat, the percentage of personnel that will mask; for example,
MOPP1, 50 percent masked. The system is flexible, and subordinate leaders can modify
their unit MOPP level to meet mission needs. The following standardized protective
postures assume that personnel are carrying their individual decontamination kit, M8/M9
detector paper, NAAK, and protective masks.

            (2) MOPP Ready (applies to USA/USMC only). Personnel carry their protective
masks with their load-carrying equipment (LCE). Individual MOPP gear is labeled and
stored no farther back than a logistics site (e.g., brigade support area [BSA]) and is ready to
be brought forward to the individual when needed. Pushing MOPP gear forward should not
exceed 2 hours. Units in MOPP ready are highly vulnerable to persistent agent attacks and
will automatically upgrade to MOPP0 when they determine or are notified that NBC
weapons have been used or that the threat exists for NBC weapons use. When a unit is at
MOPP ready, personnel will have field-expedient items, such as wet weather gear,
identified for use in the event of an unanticipated NBC attack. Additionally, USAF



IV-4
personnel stationed in or deployed to NBC medium- and high-threat areas are issued NBC
protective equipment capable of bringing them to the MOPP4 level of protection. Therefore,
when the theater commander declares MOPP ready, USAF personnel will automatically
assume MOPP0 as opposed to MOPP ready.

           (3) MOPP0 (see Table IV-2). IPE is issued to and inspected by the individual
and prepared for use. Personnel carry their protective masks with their LCE. The standard
issue overgarment and other IPE are carried or are readily available. To be considered
readily available, equipment must be carried by each individual, stored within arm’s reach,
or be available within 5 minutes; for example, within the work area, vehicle, or fighting
position. Units in MOPP0 are highly vulnerable to persistent agent attacks and will
automatically upgrade to MOPP1 when they determine or are notified that persistent NBC
weapons have been used or that the threat exists for NBC weapons use. The primary use
for MOPP0 is during periods of increased alert when an enemy has a CB employment
capability, but there is no indication of use in the immediate future. MOPP0 is not
applicable to forces afloat.

                       •    CB threat

                       •    Preattack

                   MOPP0 is used during periods of increased alert when the enemy has
                   CB employment capability but there is no indication of use in the
                   immediate future.




                                                                                        IV-5
          (4) MOPP1 (see Table IV-3). When directed to MOPP1, personnel immediately
don the overgarment. In hot weather, the overgarment jacket can be left open and the
overgarment can be worn directly over underwear and other IPE making up the individual
MOPP gear (e.g., footwear covers, mask, and gloves are readily available or carried). M8 or
M9 paper is attached to the overgarment, (carry the NAAK and decontamination kit or
keep them at hand). MOPP1 provides a great deal of protection against persistent agents.
The primary use for MOPP1 is when a CB attack in theater is possible. Personnel must
remove contact lenses and wear protective mask optical inserts. Leaders also monitor
hydration levels. For forces afloat, MOPP1 means IPE is available.

                                        Table IV-3. MOPP Level 1

                       •    Preattack

                   MOPP1 is generally used when a chemical, and/or biological attack in
                   theater is possible.




IV-6
           (5) MOPP2 (see Table IV-4). Personnel wear and/or put on their footwear
covers, overgarment, and the protective helmet cover. As with MOPP1, the overgarment
jacket may be left open, but trousers remain closed. The mask with mask carrier and gloves
are carried. The primary use for MOPP2 is when a CB attack in theater is possible.
Personnel carry M8 and M9 paper, nerve agent antidotes, and decontamination kits or keep
them at hand. Personnel wear the protective mask optical inserts and maintain hydration
levels. For forces afloat, MOPP2 means that personnel begin carrying masks.

                       •    CB threat
                       •    Preattack

                   MOPP2 is generally used when a chemical, and/or biological attack in
                   theater is likely.




                                                                                          IV-7
           (6) MOPP3 (see Table IV-5). Personnel wear the overgarment, footwear covers,
protective mask, and protective helmet cover. Again, flexibility is built into the system to
allow for personnel relief at MOPP3, particularly in hot weather. Personnel can open the
overgarment jacket and roll the protective mask hood for ventilation, but the trousers
remain closed. The protective gloves are carried. The primary use of MOPP3 is for
personnel operating inside areas where a chemical-agent contact hazard does not exist.
MOPP3 is not appropriate if a contact hazard is present. At MOPP3, forces afloat don
protective suits and boots and activate intermittent countermeasure washdown.

                                              Primary Use

                       •    CB threat
                       •    Postattack

                   MOPP3 is generally used in areas with no contact hazard or
                   operationally significant percutaneous vapor hazard.




IV-8
           (7) MOPP4 (See Table IV-6). Personnel completely encapsulate themselves by
closing their overgarments, adjusting all drawstrings to minimize the likelihood of any
openings, and putting on their protective gloves. MOPP4 is used when the highest degree of
protection is required, or if CB agents are present but the actual hazard is not determined.
As with every other MOPP level, flexibility is built into the system to provide relief to the
individual. Once the hazard is identified and risk assessment measures are employed, the
overgarment may be left open.

Note: During coalition operations, US forces familiarize themselves with the protection
levels used by personnel from other nations.

                        •    During-attack
                        •    During and postattack

                    MOPP4 is used when the highest degree of CB protection is required,
                    or when CB agents are present; but the actual hazard has not been
                    determined.


     b.    MOPP Options. A MOPP option includes mask only. The mask is worn with the
long-sleeve duty uniform (for limited skin protection). The mask-only command may be
given under these situations:

                •   When riot control agents (RCAs) are being employed and no CB threat
exists.

                •   In a downwind vapor hazard of a nonpersistent CB agent.



                                        CAUTION
             Mask only is not normally an appropriate command when blister
             or nerve agents are involved.

        The term “mask” includes any form of respiratory protection against NBC hazards as issued by services.

   ² IPE must be available to soldiers and marines within 2 hours. A second set must be available in 6 hours. MOPP ready does not
   apply to the USAF.

   3
       IPE must be within arm’s reach of personnel.


      c.    Automatic Masking. Automatic masking is the act of immediately masking and
assuming MOPP4 when encountering CB attack indicators. Before CB weapons usage is
confirmed, personnel will don their masks when there is a high probability of a CB attack.
When chemical agents have been employed, commanders at all levels may establish a
modified policy of automatic-masking by designating additional events as automatic
masking criteria. Once this information is disseminated, personnel will mask and assume
MOPP4 automatically whenever one of these events occurs. Automatic-masking criteria
should be used by the commander as a decision tool and is based on NBC IPB, risk
assessment, and METT-T. Subordinate commanders may add automatic masking criteria
at their discretion. High probability CB attack indicators can include—

                •    The sounding of a chemical-agent alarm.

                •    A positive reading on chemical-agent detector paper or a CAM.

                •    Personnel experiencing symptoms of chemical-agent poisoning.

     d.   Identification of Personnel in MOPP. Identifying personnel in MOPP can be
accomplished through various means. Personnel follow the guidance prescribed in service
TMs or TOs. However, one way is to use tape that indicates the individual’s rank and first
and last names. Blood type and religion are optional data entries. When personnel are not
in MOPP, a strip of tape with all the information printed on it can be placed on the


IV-10
individual’s helmet (front and back), mask canister, overgarment bag, or mask carrier.
When overgarments are put on, personnel can pull the tape off the overgarment bag and
place it on their overgarments to further ease identification.

     e.   MOPP System Flexibility.

           (1) MOPP is not a fixed or rigid system. Flexibility is the key to providing
maximum protection with the lowest risk possible, while still allowing mission
accomplishment. Flexibility allows designated commanders to adjust the amount of MOPP
protection required in their particular situations and still maintain combat effectiveness.
Additionally, commanders can place all or part of their units in different MOPP levels (i.e.,
split MOPP) or authorize variations within a given MOPP level. For example, a fixed-site
(e.g., AB or port) or base cluster commander may divide his AO into sectors. Based on
postattack NBC reconnaissance efforts, the commander could direct the use of different
MOPP levels (e.g., split MOPP) in the different sectors. Split MOPP is the concept of
maintaining heightened protective posture (MOPP4) only in those areas that are
contaminated, allowing personnel in uncontaminated areas to continue to operate in a
reduced posture (MOPP2). The reasons behind this idea are to reduce the impact on
personnel and to enhance mission accomplishment.

                 (a) There are challenges in using split MOPP. One of these challenges is
the fact that many individuals may routinely move from one area of an installation to
another in performing their duties. Split MOPP should be done on a zone-by-zone basis. A
base/fixed site could be divided into multiple NBC zones (not to be confused with on-base
sectors).

                (b) Zone borders tend to be natural geographic markers (such as roads
and fences) to help differentiate the zones and ensure zone recognition.

                 (c) When split MOPP is in effect, travel requires personnel to know not
only the zone status of their current area but also the status of the areas they will be
traveling through and their destination. If personnel will be traveling from a clean to a
dirty area, they must be prepared to don MOPP gear at the transition point to the
contaminated zone.

               (d) Zone transition points (e.g., road intersections where clean and dirty
chemical zones meet) may be used, and the fixed-site/base personnel place
stanchions/barricades at these locations when zone transitions are in effect.

              (e) Personnel must plan their routes to minimize contact with
contaminated areas, and they must know where to don MOPP gear if required.

             (f) Units also establish various procedures for managing transzone
movement. For example, personnel may coordinate routes through their unit operations
center.

             (2) When directed, personnel may leave the overgarment jacket open at MOPP
1, 2, 3, or 4, allowing greater ventilation. Personnel may leave the hood open or rolled when
the mask is worn. Commanders will decide which of these variations to use based on the



                                                                                         IV-11
threat, temperature, and unit work intensity. Personnel may also don (based on the
situation) clothing such as the air crewman’s cape, SCALP, or wet-weather gear.

          (3) Personnel wear protective gloves at MOPP1 through 4 when handling
equipment that has been decontaminated. This prevents contact with agents that may have
been absorbed by equipment surfaces.

            (4) Where the hazard is from residual nuclear effects (e.g., fallout), the
commander modifies the MOPP level based on his assessment of the situation and the
criticality of the mission. MOPP gear does not protect against gamma or neutron radiation;
however, wearing MOPP gear can reduce radiological hazards from beta particle burns and
alpha particle ingestion. Primary concerns are to reduce the amount of radioactive
contamination that contacts the skin and to prevent ingestion of radioactive particles.

        f.   Impact of MOPP.

         (1) Personnel wearing MOPP4 will take about one and one-half times longer to
perform most tasks.

           (2) Decision making and precision control (e.g., typing a message or aiming)
are slowed even more than manual tasks. The normal expected completion time should be
multiplied by two and one-half (or more, if personnel have been in MOPP4 for an extended
period or are overheated).

           (3) Well-prepared personnel suffer less stress when in MOPP than personnel
who are less-prepared. Well-prepared personnel are those who are in good physical
condition and have trained extensively in protective gear. Physically fit personnel are more
resistant to physical and mental fatigue and acclimatize more quickly to climatic heat or
the heat associated with MOPP wear than less fit personnel.

           (4) Units that anticipate deployment to regions where the employment of CB
agents is possible should augment physical training (PT) programs and increase their state
of heat acclimatization. To optimize heat acclimatization, personnel should progressively
increase the duration (reaching 2 to 4 hours) and intensity of exercise in the heat over 7 to
14 consecutive days. Finally, when personnel are required to routinely work in MOPP gear,
it is important to practice good hygiene and keep the skin clean to avoid heat rash, which
can dramatically reduce the body’s ability to regulate temperature.

     SUSTAINED OPERATIONS IN A NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, AND
                  CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT


1.    Background

     The modern battlefield and the threat of NBC weapons pose significant challenges to
leaders and their units. Based on those challenges, this chapter addresses the impact of the
NBC environment as it affects the performance of individuals and units. This chapter
provides insights into the degradation to be expected from enemy employment of NBC
weapons and provides suggested guidance for maintaining operational tempo in the NBC
environment. The basic goals remain to avoid or minimize the impact of the contamination
and to enhance endurance and task performance. The NBC environment impacts leaders
and subordinates from different aspects. Leaders provide the necessary command and
control to ensure successful operations, and leaders must train themselves to know what to
expect and to recognize common pitfalls. Subordinates, on the other hand, must focus on
the accomplishment of individual and collective tasks.

2.    Impact of a Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Environment

     When individuals are encapsulated in MOPP ensembles, they are subjected to both
physiological and psychological stresses. However, given an understanding of the NBC
environment, its impact, and proper training, individuals can perform assigned tasks
successfully for a considerable period of time.

      a.    Physiological and Psychological Impact. There are physiological and
psychological factors that are common to military operations and operations in the NBC
environment. A number of these factors can contribute to decreased tolerance due to the
effects of operations in an NBC environment (see Table V-1 [page V-2]). Because these
factors are amplified in an NBC environment, leaders and their subordinates are alert for
those factors that can impact mission operations (see Table V-2 [page V-2]). Leaders are
also aware of psychological issues that can be magnified by an NBC environment (e.g.,
individuals may become depressed or hyperactive) (see Table V-3 [page V-3]). See Chapter
IV for information on how physiological and psychological degradation impacts MOPP
analysis and Appendix C for more detailed information on the stress incurred while
wearing IPE.




                                                                                         V-1
                      Table V-1. Factors That Influence Decreased Tolerance

                                 •   Disease/medication
                                 •   Dehydration
                                 •   Heat/cold
                                 •   MOPP gear
                                 •   Exhaustion
                                 •   Workload
                                 •   Food deprivation
                                 •   Isolation



      b.   Impact on Leaders. A major element of leadership is that the leaders must take
care of themselves as well as their personnel. They are subject to the same degradation that
can befall their personnel. Leader neglect can result in leaders becoming casualties.
Leaders supervise countermeasures such as work/rest cycles, periodic fluid replacement,
and scheduling heavy work rate activities at times other than high temperatures (see Table
V-4). Leaders may also display actions and attitudes that affect their effectiveness (e.g.,
less leader adaptability and/or more leader casualties). To help mitigate this consideration,
confidence is developed during stressful NBC training.

            Table V-2. Common Signs of Physiological and Psychological Degradation

      Physiological Degradation                               Psychological Degradation
        • Nervousness                                           • Forgetfulness
        • Trembling                                             • Inattentiveness
        • Sweating                                              • Decreased confidence
        • Pounding heart                                        • Frustration
        • Dry mouth                                             • Difficulty concentrating
        • Headache                                              • Startled response to noise
        •   Fatigue                                             •   Uncooperative behavior
        •   Nausea


     c.    Impact on Individuals. Just as leaders are impacted by operations in an NBC
environment, there are many stressors (see Table V-5) that impact an individual’s ability to
function in an NBC environment. For example, even though personnel become dehydrated,
they do not feel thirsty; thus, they do not practice forced drinking. MOPP4 can increase
perceptions of respiratory distress and decrease clear thinking. Personnel also may begin to
take dangerous shortcuts and make mistakes while performing tasks. Crews in closed
vehicles in MOPP4 can experience motion sickness. Individuals operating in high elevations
in MOPP4 can experience serious degradation and require up to 4 days to adjust.

           •      Carelessness                             •   Perceived respiratory stress




3.   Impact of a Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Environment on Operations

     Since NBC weapons can be delivered by multiple means, all phases of military
operations could be severely impacted. C2, maneuver, fires, and communications can be
impacted by operations in an NBC environment.

     a.   C2. Because of physical and mental fatigue, leaders performance may be
degraded.

          •       Leadership judgment and response to changing situations are less effective.

           • Tasks dealing with accuracy of reports, coordination of fire plans, and
issuance of OPORDs are degraded.

          • Intelligence-gathering assets, such as scouts, are degraded, resulting in less
timely and less-detailed information to the commander.



                                                                                                          V-3
          • Clarity and conciseness of OPORDs can diminish rapidly with leaders
omitting essential items of information.

             •   Commanders required more time to prepare orders.

             •   Commander’s plans for and control of direct and indirect fires deteriorated
with time.

          • Tactical commanders had a tendency to focus inward and were less aware of
adjacent units.

      b.    Maneuver. Synchronization of tactical maneuver is more difficult in the NBC
environment. Control of units, timing of operations, and the ability to adhere to the scheme
of maneuver can be degraded. Specifically, units can incur additional risks when operating
in an NBC environment. The additional risks (see Table V-6) can manifest themselves in
many ways. For example, units may miss objectives (e.g., get lost) or lose more combat
vehicles to enemy fire, so the ability to control units is degraded. Overall, the vulnerability
of forces can increase the longer a unit operates in MOPP4.

      c.    Fires. The effectiveness of direct and indirect fires can decrease in an NBC
environment. Target detection and acquisition is much more difficult. For example,
personnel conducting target acquisition acquire targets at considerably shorter distances;
land force, combat-fighting vehicles fire fewer rounds; and infantry-fighting vehicles tend to
fight at closer ranges. Further, fewer small-arms engagements occur and less antitank
missile rounds are expended. Other considerations include—

             •   Battle losses increase as units spend longer periods in NBC protection.

             •   The engagement range for direct-fire weapons decreases.

             •   Fratricide engagements increase.

             •   The battle intensity in the attack is considerably lower.

             •   The ability of indirect fire to support the direct-fire battle is degraded.

          • The time to prepare and transmit live-fire requests for voice/digital
transmission increase, and the time to prepare indirect weapons for firing takes longer.

              MOPP4 were not able to perform their
              mission longer than 3 to 6 hours).


     d.    Communications. The effectiveness of communications, both face to face and via
radio, can deteriorate in an NBC environment. Hearing and seeing are degraded. The
specific impact of an NBC environment can include the following:

          •      Voice recognition diminishes, leading to repeated requests for call signs.

          •      Personnel use hand signals more often.

          •      Message length doubles.

          •      Number of radio messages increases.

          •      Longer transmission times increase vulnerability to enemy electronic warfare
                 (EW).

4.   Impact of a Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Environment on Sustainment

     Sustaining combat operations in NBC environments presents major challenges.
Operations will be slowed and task performance, both complex and simple, can be
encumbered by wearing IPE. Degradation can be found in all areas of sustainment, to
include the establishment and operation of logistical sites, movement of supply vehicles,
maintenance, and medical support.

      a.   Preparation. The impact of an NBC environment can result in less dispersal of
forces and camouflage of vehicles. Setup of sites—such as Class III refuel points—takes



                                                                                                                V-5
longer, key safety measures are not as closely followed, and units process fewer supply
requests.

     b.    Movement of Supply Vehicles. Movement times for logistical packages increase.
Drivers experience more fatigue and reduced dexterity, resulting in increased time to
process supplies. Consumption of diesel fuel also increases due to greater distances
traveled. More time is required to move to subsequent battle positions, resulting in overall
slower rates of travel.

      c.   Maintenance. Operations are adversely impacted by poor communications and
incorrect diagnosis while in MOPP4. For example, maintenance teams frequently do not
carry appropriate tools to the work site, on-site repairs take longer, safety measures are not
strictly adhered to, and maintenance is often deferred until MOPP levels are reduced.

     d.    Medical Support. Medical operations degrade due to fatigue and the reduced
dexterity of medical personnel. The times required to conduct activities—such as setting up
medical facilities, conducting triage, measuring patient vital signs, and administering
medications—all increase. Also, surgical procedures cannot be performed in MOPP4.
Therefore, COLPRO is required to continue medical support (surgical procedures) in a
contaminated environment.

5.    Executing Countermeasures

     Military leaders know that all phases of military operations can be degraded by an
NBC environment, but some areas are more degraded than others. If leaders know what to
expect, they can moderate the expected degradation. Comprehending the effect of an NBC
environment on the unit’s mission accomplishment can be achieved through—

      •   Performing mission-essential tasks, such as C², regularly in MOPP4.

     • Conducting target acquisition (TA) and identification for individual and crew-
served weapons.

      •   Exercising communications functions to ensure effective and efficient results.

     • Anticipating additional sustainment requirements—more water consumption,
increased wear and tear on IPE, etc.

      •   Striving for simplicity in plans.

      •   Understanding the impact of MOPP4 on mobility.

     a.    Unit Preparation. Preparation for operation in an NBC environment is critical
to successful operations. Preparation must emphasize individual/crew readiness. It is
important that units focus on the performance of mission tasks under NBC conditions
because it leads to improvements in performance and endurance of individuals and crews.
Individuals learn which tasks can be performed in MOPP with little or no modification and
which tasks require the development of work-arounds or deferment until MOPP can be
reduced.



V-6
     b.  Leader Preparation. Leader preparedness for operations in the NBC
environment is extremely important. For effective leader countermeasures, leaders
should—

           • Observe their personnel to learn and recognize the signs of serious
physiological and psychological degradation.

            •   Use coping strategies to deal with physical and mental aspects of the NBC
battlefield.

            • Focus on the maintenance of high physical standards for all personnel to
facilitate endurance.

           •    Assess unit status continually.

        • Pace themselves and plan for rest and sleep periods, especially as the periods
in MOPP4 extend.

          • Rely on their staff more and allow subordinates more latitude, thus avoiding
the tendency to micromanage.

         • Focus on attention to detail when planning and developing OPORDs and
fragmentary orders (FRAGORDs).

           •    Plan for more efficient use of their time.

      c.    Individual Preparation. Readiness for the individual must focus on ways to
effectively operate in an NBC environment. Individual preparation must include—

           •    Ensuring that NBC protective equipment is properly used and maintained.

          • Understanding the need to drink adequate amounts of fluids and recognizing
the symptoms of dehydration.

           •    Performing tasks in MOPP4 and doing so for extended periods of time.

          • Recognizing the need to develop work-arounds for difficult tasks that must be
accomplished. Individuals will share this information with their buddies and inform their
leaders.

           •    Understanding the physiology and psychology of encapsulation in MOPP4.

           •    Understanding hyperventilation and developing breathing techniques while
masked.

           •    Talking slowly and more clearly through the mask.

           •    Understanding and using work/rest cycles.

           •    Focusing on task completion versus time required.


                                                                                         V-7
     d.   Preparation for Crews, Teams, and Units. Because all tasks are degraded to
some extent, the necessity for teams and units to maintain their unit cohesion and
operational tempo (OPTEMPO) become critical. Key factors that should be considered
include—

          •   Conducting tasks in MOPP4 for extended periods.

          •   Focusing on cross training of teams and crews.

          •   Using work/rest cycles and sleep periods for crew members.

          • Emphasizing that basic survivability functions cannot be ignored, especially
tasks such as cover and concealment.

           • Developing buddy systems to keep a check on individuals within the unit to
detect serious degradation.

          •   Using arm-and-hand signals to facilitate routine communications.

          •   Using a system of individual identification within the unit.

         • Being aware that medical care capabilities are greatly reduced in a
contaminated environment without COLPRO.

                             INDIVIDUAL PROTECTION



1.   Background
      US military forces possess a wide array of the world’s best, mission-oriented,
individual NBC protective equipment. Using this equipment, armed forces of the US are
equipped to conduct prompt, sustained, and decisive operations throughout the spectrum of
conflict in any environment—NBC or otherwise. This chapter provides an overview of the
individual protection capabilities that are available to US forces. See Appendix A for more
detailed information on IPE.
Protecting the force consists of those actions taken to prevent or mitigate hostile actions
against personnel, resources, facilities, and critical information. These actions conserve the
force’s fighting potential so that it can be decisively applied, and sufficient equipment must
be available to protect not only the uniformed force, but also the essential supporting US
and civilian workforce.

2.   Mission-Oriented Protective Posture

      Introduction. The MOPP ensemble protects against NBC contamination. It consists of
the overgarment, mask, hood, overboots, and protective gloves. Before personnel can protect
themselves against NBC hazards, they must first know the purpose of MOPP and the
capabilities of the IPE that is available for their use during tactical operations. The types of
IPE used depend on the protection required, but all fall within two major divisions:
permeable and impermeable. Permeable clothing allows air and moisture to pass through
the fabric. Impermeable clothing does not. An example of permeable protective clothing is
the joint service lightweight integrated suit technology (JSLIST) protective overgarment.
An example of the impermeable protective gear is the SCALP.

     a.    Protective Clothing.

            (1) JSLIST Chemical Protective Overgarment. Over time, the JSLIST
chemical protective overgarment (CPO) will replace its predecessor, the battle dress
overgarment (BDO), as stocks become available. The JSLIST provides protection against
liquid, solid, and/or vapor CB agents and radioactive alpha and beta particles. It is a
lightweight garment and it can be laundered up to six times for personal hygiene. The
JSLIST ensemble will be worn in all environments when under threat of an imminent NBC
attack and after chemical operations have been initiated. See Table VI-1 (page VI-2), for
information on the JSLIST CPO capabilities.




                                                                                            VI-1

* The BDO service is 22 days; however, the commander can authorize increased wear time up to 30 days (at a
slightly increased risk).


            (2) Chemical Protective Undergarment. The chemical protective undergarment
(CPU) is worn under an approved uniform as part of an entire ensemble. The CPU provides
protection against CB agents, agent vapor, liquid droplets, and radioactive alpha and beta
particles. The CPU is not a stand-alone garment. It is worn under the standard duty
uniform, such as the battle dress uniform (BDU). The CPU is not intended to be worn under
the JSLIST or BDO. The CPU is donned when personnel are directed to go from MOPP0 to
MOPP1. When the CPU is used, the protection afforded is equivalent to that provided by a
MOPP3 or 4 ensemble. See Table VI-1 for information on CPU capabilities.

          (3) Battle Dress Overgarment. The BDO provides protection against chemical-
agent vapors, liquid droplets, biological agents, and radioactive alpha and beta particles.
The BDO is normally worn over the duty uniform; however, during high temperatures, it
may be worn over underwear. See Table VI-1 for information on BDO capabilities.

           (4) A/P22P-9A (V) Below-the-Neck Protective Assembly (USN/USMC). The
A/P22P-9A (V) below-the-neck protective assembly provides a protective ensemble that
includes undergarments, footwear covers, gloves, and a cape to protect aircrew personnel
from liquid CB contamination or radioactive particles. See Appendix A for more detailed
information.

           (5) Wet-Weather Clothing. Wet-weather clothing consists of a parka and
overalls. The system is designed to protect against all liquid chemical warfare agents in a
cold and/or wet climate both ashore and aboard ship. The system can be worn over the CP
ensemble for additional protection and to prevent soaking the wearer. See Appendix A for
more information on wet-weather clothing.

          (6) Chemical Protective Suit OG MK III (USN). This overgarment protects the
wearer against all known CB agents that present a percutaneous hazard. The suit consists
of a smock and a separate pair of trousers. This garment will be replaced Navy-wide by the


VI-2
JSLIST. This suit protects against chemical-agent vapors, aerosols, droplets of liquid, and
biological agents. See Table VI-1 for information on its capabilities.

           (7) Chemical Protective Suit, Saratoga (USMC). Like the BDO, the Saratoga
CP suit is an air-permeable, camouflage-patterned overgarment. The Saratoga protects
against chemical-agent vapors, aerosols, droplets, and unknown biological agents and can
be laundered for personnel hygiene purpose. See Table VI-1 for further information on its
capabilities.

            (8) CWU-66/P Aircrew Ensemble (USAF). The CWU-66/P is a one-piece
flightsuit configuration that provides 24-hour protection against CB agents in vapor or
aerosol form. It is less bulky than prior ensembles, offers a reduced thermal load burden,
and is compatible with aircrew life support equipment. This ensemble is permeable. If the
clothing becomes contaminated, the garments are disposed of following doffing procedures.
Contaminated garments cannot be reused or laundered to remove contamination. Tracking
the days of wear for permeable protective clothing is important. Personnel can annotate the
number days of wear by different methods. One way would be to annotate the number of
days of wear on the white clothing tag on the inside of the jacket.

           (9) Suit, Contamination Avoidance, Liquid Protective. The SCALP is an
impermeable, lightweight, inexpensive, disposable ensemble that can provide supplemental
liquid protection when worn over a standard CPO. Operationally, the SCALP is worn by
personnel who may by necessity, be forced to leave COLPRO under chemical attack to
perform some vital maintenance or reconnaissance function. If contaminated by chemicals,
the SCALP can be discarded to reduce reentry time. A secondary use of the SCALP is to
protect decontamination personnel from being soaked during decontamination operations.
See Appendix A for more information on the SCALP.

           (10) Chemical Protective Glove Set. A glove set consists of an outer glove for
protection and an inner glove for perspiration absorption. The outer gloves are made of an
impermeable, black, butyl rubber. The inner gloves are made of thin, white cotton. The
inner gloves can be worn on either hand. When engaged in heavy work or during cold
weather, personnel should wear standard work gloves or black shells over the butyl rubber
gloves to protect them from damage. See Table VI-1 for information on their capabilities
and Appendix A for more detailed information.

           (11) Green Vinyl Overboot (GVO); Black Vinyl Overboot (BVO); and
Multipurpose, Lightweight Overboot (MULO). The GVO, BVO, or MULO can be used to
protect the wearer against NBC agents and environmental effects (rain, mud, or snow). See
Table VI-1 for information on overboot capabilities and Appendix A for more detailed
information.

            (12) Chemical Protective Footwear Cover. The impermeable chemical protective
footwear cover (CPFC) protects feet from CB agents and radioactive alpha and beta
particles. See Table VI-1 for information on CPFC capabilities and Appendix A for more
detailed information.

          (13) Chemical Protective Helmet Cover. The CP helmet cover is intended to
provide the personnel armor system ground troop (PASGT) helmet with protection from CB



                                                                                         VI-3
contamination and radioactive alpha and beta particles. See Appendix A for more
information on the helmet cover.

            (14) Self-Contained, Toxic-Environment Protective Outfit (STEPO). The STEPO
is a totally encapsulating system that provides protection for personnel working in highly
toxic, unknown, or oxygen-deficient environments that are immediately dangerous to life
and health. STEPO protects the wearer against a wide range of industrial chemicals;
petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL); and CW agents. The impermeable STEPO CP suit
provides protection against hazardous liquids, solids, and vapors. STEPO provides a choice
of breathing apparatuses to accommodate the user and mission requirements. The system
also includes a personal cooling system to reduce heat stress and a communication system
to enable communications between team members and support personnel.

      b.   Other Protective Ensembles. Protective masks keep wearers from breathing air
contaminated with NBC warfare agents. Masks are available in these categories: field
protective masks, M40 and MCU-2A/P; combat vehicle mask, M42; aircrew masks, M45,
MBU 19/P, A/P 23P-14A(V) (helicopter only), and A/P 22P-14(V) 1-4 (Marines fixed wing
only); and special-purpose masks. These protective masks are not authorized for use
during industrial chemical spills. Chemicals of that nature normally require a SCBA.
Protective masks are not effective against chemicals such as ammonia or carbon monoxide,
and they are not effective in confined spaces when there is insufficient oxygen to support
life. See Appendix A for descriptive information about protective masks.

           (1) Protective Masks. The fielded masks provide users with respiratory, eye,
and face protection against CB agents and radioactive fallout particles. A properly worn
and fitted protective mask provides a gas-tight face seal, which prevents unfiltered air from
reaching the wearer’s respiratory system.

             (2) Proper Fit. Determining the proper fit for an individual’s protective mask
is critical. A small percentage of service personnel cannot be adequately fitted with the
authorized protective mask. Test systems are available to determine if service personnel
have properly fitted masks. If not, the Army and Air Force will then use the M45 CB mask
to try and properly fit the hard-to-fit service member. If the service member still cannot be
properly fitted with a protective mask, the individual may not be deployable to an AO with
a CB threat. See applicable service TMs, technical bulletins (TBs), and TOs for specific
instructions on hard-to-fit personnel.

          (3) Prescription Mask Inserts. Individuals requiring corrective eyewear must
have prescription mask optical inserts for their protective masks. The optical inserts
require proper placement in the mask to provide maximum clarity and field of vision. See
Appendix I for description of prescription optical inserts for the protective mask.

     c.    Other IPE. Other critical IPE material includes medical items (i.e., skin
exposure reduction paste against chemical warfare agents [SERPACWA], NAAK, etc.),
individual decontamination kits, and chemical detector paper. See Appendix A for
descriptions of these items.

     d.  Radiological Protection. See Appendix D for information on OEG, LLR exposure,
DU, and Appendix J for information on EMP protection considerations.



VI-4
3.   Individual Protection Logistics Considerations

      To meet sustainment requirements for operations under NBC conditions, commanders
must ensure responsiveness to unit requirements. Units (or authorized storage locations)
will stock specific authorized quantities of NBC defense equipment for service member use
as specified in service-specific authorization documents. For example, a forward deployed
unit, such as a carrier battle group or a USMC expeditionary unit, may require both sets of
MOPP gear to be immediately available based on the threat. Conversely, land forces may
require that one set of IPE be carried as part of an individual’s field gear and a second set of
IPE be maintained by the unit logistics base. This is, again, based on the threat. Other
sustainment techniques or procedures are contained in service logistics publications.

       a.   Resupply of additional sets of MOPP gear into combat-configured loads can be
accomplished by methods such as palletizing the needed IPE. The intent of palletizing IPE
is to create a push package that can either be broken down at an arrival location (airfield or
seaport) for immediate issue to units or for further movement forward. The method of
palletizing and movement depends on the types of units and how each performs its mission.

     b.    Logistics planning and push package configurations will vary based on the unit
general deployment plan or contingency mission and the likelihood of an NBC threat in an
AO. All this is integrated and executed through service logistics channels. These items will
be moved based on certain time lines dictated by the OPLAN and on events that may occur
during the operation.

     c.    Other key logistics/sustainment considerations include—

           •   Anticipating resupply and replacement requirements for IPE.

            • Monitoring serviceability for items, such as overgarments, that have specific
shelf lives (i.e., expiration dates).

          • Monitoring serviceability of IPE stockages. Some items, such as
overgarments and/or mask filter canisters, are issued by lot number. Periodic surveillance
by the material developer can result in certain lots being reclassified for training use only.

           •   Tracking days of wear of overgarments (once they are removed from their
bags).

     d.    Operational planners and supporting logisticians coordinate to provide sufficient
quantities of IPE. For example, additional sets of IPE may be issued to designated
mission-essential HN personnel, foreign military, and/or other nongovernment personnel.




                                                                                            VI-5
4.     Toxic Industrial Material Individual Protection

     Background. Military personal protective clothing and equipment and the protective
mask are designed to protect personnel from NBC agents in a combat environment, but
provide only limited protection from some of the TIC. Personnel equipped with standard
military personal protective clothing must not remain in a TIC environment and should
seek a clean area as soon as possible.

      a.   Respiratory Protection. Proper selection and wear of approved IPE can provide
the required respiratory protection. This may be achieved by air purification devices or by
atmosphere-supplying respiratory equipment, such as the SCBA. The air-purifying masks
should never be worn in the presence of unidentified contaminants or in atmospheres
containing less than 19.5 percent oxygen. This limits the use of these devices in some
emergency response operations. The two types of respirators, the SCBA and the supplied-
air respirators (SARs), provide personnel with a source of air that creates a positive
pressure in the facepiece. These respirators permit the individual to operate in low-oxygen
and volatile chemical atmospheres where an air-purifying respirator does not offer enough
protection. The SCBA is most commonly used in emergency operations, and the SAR is used
when extended work times are required. These devices will provide the responder with the
greatest protection against exposures to gases and vapors.

      b.    Individual Protection Levels. There are four levels of protection established by
the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) according to 29 Code of Federal Regulation
(CFR) 1910.120. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has also
adopted these four levels. The level of skin and respiratory protection provided by the
selected CP ensemble determines the protection that is furnished to the responder. The
levels of protection are divided into four categories (Levels A, B, C, and D) and worn
according to guidelines published by OSHA and the National Fire Protection Ageny
(NFPA). Personal protective equipment (PPE) places an increased level of mental and
physiological stress on individuals (e.g., heat stress and respiratory resistance), which must
be carefully monitored and evaluated through all phases of an operation. See Appendix A
for descriptions of protection Levels A through D.

                                         Chapter VII
                            COLLECTIVE PROTECTION


1.   Background

      Protection from NBC weapons is needed when there is a chance of NBC contamination
to individuals or groups of personnel. There are two components of NBC Protection—
individual protection and COLPRO. COLPRO is that protection provided for personnel to
carry out functions without being restricted by protective clothing. Joint Publication (JP) 1-
02, Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, describes COLPRO
as facilities or systems equipped with air filtration devices and air locks to provide
personnel with a toxic-free environment for performing critical work and obtaining rest and
relief in order to sustain combat operations. COLPRO is provided through a facility or the
integral portion of equipment design whereby individuals or groups may be afforded
protection. The term COLPRO applies to buildings, facilities, or ships modified to afford
protection; pieces of equipment (in their entirety or in part); or vehicles designed to provide
NBC protection. COLPRO usage is characterized by the requirement for an individual or
group to execute specific actions, such as donning or doffing equipment, entering a facility,
or closing openings in order to derive the benefits of COLPRO. COLPRO provides a safe
environment for individuals to carry out tactical functions—such as weapons employment,
medical care, C2, and communications—without being restricted by wearing the full set of
NBC protective clothing. This chapter addresses COLPRO planning considerations and the
types of COLPRO; and it discusses fixed-site, transportable, mobile, and Navy COLPRO
systems. See Appendix B for further information on preparing a COLPRO SOP, entry and
exit procedures, and guidance on shelter preparation and operation. See FM 8-10-7, Health
Service Support in a Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Environment, for information on the
employment of CP systems as MTFs.

2.   Planning for Collective Protection
       COLPRO is an important aspect of NBC defense. It does not replace MOPP gear, but
it allows the commander to reduce MOPP levels while in a contaminated environment.
COLPRO supports four primary areas that erode quickly in an NBC environment— task
performance, medical care, personnel rest/relief, and sustained operations. Commanders
understand that COLPRO requires training of personnel in doffing and donning procedures
to enter and exit shelters. Commanders who understand the trade-offs associated with
COLPRO can more accurately plan for the effective and beneficial use of CP systems. To
properly utilize COLPRO, it must be fully integrated into the commander’s overall plan.
Avoiding contaminated areas or displacing from contaminated terrain is desirable, but
neither is always possible. It may be necessary to cross, occupy, or remain in contaminated
terrain. These situations require COLPRO.
     a.   General Planning Considerations.

          (1)     The commander must consider the threat, mission, tactical environment,
and type of COLPRO available in his planning process. The following factors should be
considered in the planning process:



                                                                                          VII-1
                  •   Does the function occupy a location that is considered to be a high-risk
target?

                  •   How long is the facility or area likely to be subject to an NBC hazard?

                  •   Do demands of operations require remaining in the hazard area?

                  •   Can the mission be accomplished in the hazard area without
COLPRO?

          (2)    Regardless of the type of COLPRO, the commander’s planning must
address supply, maintenance, gas and particulate filters, and contaminated-filter disposal.

                   • Supply. Adequate supply planning is a key element in the effective use
of CP systems. Most systems are not supply-intensive; however, the operation of such
systems requires a continuous resupply of consumable and expendable items. Included are
items that provide a means of vulnerability reduction such as rain gear, ponchos, and
plastic bags. These will keep liquid contamination away from the overgarment. Survival
under NBC conditions could depend on these items. Therefore, it is not a question of merely
maintaining special-purpose COLPRO supplies, it is a matter of obtaining needed
quantities of existing supplies. Arrange to have supplies to support extended operations of a
fixed shelter kept inside the shelter, if possible. Plan for the needed supplies, and stockpile
them before an attack. As a minimum, these supplies should include protective clothing,
expedient contamination avoidance items, decontamination kits, detector kits, and filters.
These items will allow shelter users to conduct a protective uniform exchange. Provide
adequate food and water if the shelter will operate for long periods within the contaminated
area. If the shelter requires fuel, ensure that it is requisitioned and stored. If the system
has an external power supply, store fuel outside and away from the shelter. Plan for
supplies to maintain operations inside the shelter.

                   • Maintenance. In most cases, the maintenance of CP systems is
minimal at organizational levels. Most systems have little or no operator maintenance
other than before-, during-, and after-operation checks and services. Operators may need to
reset circuit breakers or perform system start-up procedures. At the unit level,
maintenance is usually limited to troubleshooting and removing and/or replacing major
components or subassemblies. Changing expended or contaminated filters is the most
significant maintenance task. Both the gas and particulate filters require periodic
replacement. (See applicable service technical publications for information on when to
replace filters.)

                  • Gas and Particulate Filters. The useful life of a gas filter decreases as
operating time and exposure increase. As the filter removes contaminants from the air, its
residual capacity decreases. Long exposure to moisture also decreases filter capacity for
removing chemical agents. Gas filter life expectancy varies. It depends on the size and
design of the COLPRO hardware. To determine when to replace a gas filter, the shelter
attendant or another responsible person must maintain a log of the filter unit operation.
Then, personnel should change gas filters according to the TM. In general, new filters can
withstand several chemical attacks. In most cases, missions of 48 to 72 hours can be
accomplished in a contaminated environment without a filter change. Given this capacity,



VII-2
filter change during periodic unit maintenance is often advisable. See applicable service
TOs or TMs for information on defined intervals for changing filters. Within the filter, a
particulate filter collects radiological contamination and other particles from the air. Such
accumulation on the filter does not decrease its filtering efficiency. It does, however,
decrease the airflow because of the increase in resistance. In most cases, this increase in
resistance is very gradual. It is unusual for the airflow resistance to increase to a level that
affects the flow rate appreciably. Personnel should replace this filter at the same time they
replace the gas filter or when the system drops below the minimum overpressure level
specified in the system TM.

                   • Contaminated-Filter Disposal. Filters do not decontaminate or
neutralize contamination; they merely collect and contain it. Therefore, contaminated
filters are hazardous. Replacing and disposing of these filters require care to prevent a
hazard to personnel or a spread of contamination. Commanders should establish detailed
procedures for filter disposal during peacetime and wartime situations according to
applicable TMs/TOs. Some methods of contamination disposal, such as burning, create
additional contamination (see warning below) and do not destroy radiological
contamination. The disposal method selected (e.g., containerization) should minimize any
spread of contamination.

                                           WARNING

          Burning filters contaminated with chemical agents or toxins may produce a
          downwind vapor hazard. Warn units downwind. After burning, cover the
          ashes with the excavated dirt and mark the site with contamination markers.
          Disposal of any filters after normal maintenance in peacetime also requires
          special handling and disposal of these as hazardous waste. This includes
          all masks filters and canisters and CPE filters. Material must be transported,
          stored, treated, and disposed of as such.




     b.    Manpower.

       (1)     Manpower planning for CP systems encompasses several factors.
Commanders estimate these requirements based on multiple factors that may include—

                  • Setup and teardown times. Consider the setup and teardown times.
Actual times will vary with the situation, system, and degree of training. For example, it
takes two persons in MOPP4 approximately 30 minutes to set up the simplified collective
protective equipment (SCPE) and 10 minutes to tear it down.

                 • Entry times. Commanders should estimate entry-processing times for
units based on the estimated time for MOPP gear doffing and patient decontamination.

                  • Shelter security. Commanders must ensure that security is
maintained around any protective shelter. Security requirements depend on the tactical
situation. The type and strength of a security element depends on the type of operation
being conducted, the location on the battlefield, and the personnel available to protect the


                                                                                            VII-3
shelter. Shelters with high entry/exit traffic require attendants. Post attendants at the
shelter entrance to control entry. They should also assist in the external operations of the
shelter. Exact duties during and after an NBC attack should be outlined in the unit SOP.

          (2)    Other requirements, such as communications, are also a routine part of
the commander’s planning. Some of these requirements may be system-specific, while
others may apply to all systems. They may include—

               • Communications. Personnel should use the communication systems to
communicate with others in adjacent fixed or transportable shelters or immediately outside
the shelter.

                   • Latrines. CPSs may include sanitary facilities. If the shelter is in a
permanent structure, use the existing facilities. Consider the location of existing sanitary
facilities when selecting a portion of the building for an individual relief facility. Where
water and sewage facilities are not available, provide covered containers or chemical toilets.

                  • Illumination. Have lights installed if power is available, and provide
battery-operated lights for emergency use. Keep the electric light usage to a minimum to
prevent excessive heat buildup in the shelter. An alternative would be to use cold light
sources such as chemical safety lights. Take blackout precautions where required.

                 • Camouflage. Construct or emplace shelter sites in areas that provide
cover and/or concealment.

                  • Water. Have filled canteens or other water containers placed inside
the shelter. Provide each occupant at least three quarts of drinking water for each day of
anticipated occupancy. Even if piped water is available, maintain an emergency reserve of
drinking water. Additional water may be needed for hygiene.

                  • Warning and Detection. Plan for warning and NBC detection devices
in each protective shelter. These devices serve several purposes. They can detect an NBC
attack and/or determine if the shelter interior is contaminated. These devices also monitor
personnel going through decontamination. In addition, they can warn of shelter system
failure.

      c.    Types of COLPRO. To support COLPRO planning, there are different types of
COLPRO. They are categorized according to their tactical application, interface with
tactical equipment, and mobility. The categories are fixed-site, transportable, and mobile.
Fixed-site COLPRO includes those facilities not intended to be moved; and they are
hardened, semihardened, or unhardened. Transportable shelters can be sited where
needed, can be moved as required, and are generally unhardened. Mobile COLPRO includes
those facilities, either armored or soft-skinned, that may or may not be capable of being
used on the move and may not have integrated air locks or CCAs.




VII-4
3.   Fixed-Site Collective Protection

     Fixed-site COLPRO is generally found at those locations where permanent base
operations exist. At those fixed sites, such as air operations bases, critical functions, such
as C2 must be maintained. Thus, fixed-site COLPRO occupies a critical role in the planning
process and in responding to an NBC attack. (See references such as FM 3-11.34/Marine
Corps Warfighting Publication [MCWP] 3-37.5/Naval Warfare Publication [NWP] 3-11.23/
and Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures Interservice [AFTTP (I)] 3-2.33,
Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for NBC Defense of Theater Fixed Sites,
Ports, and Airfield, for further details on COLPRO for fixed sites.)

      a.   Background. Fixed-site COLPRO is categorized as active or passive, according
to the type of facility and the equipment available. Active protection requires a high-
efficiency air filtration unit and a tightly constructed building or shelter. This system
provides the highest levels of NBC protection for long periods. Figure VII-1 depicts a
typical basic CPS design using overpressure and air locks. With passive applications, the
building or shelter acts as a protective barrier by limiting the exchange of air between
indoors and outdoors. The lesser amount of air that passes (the exchange rate), the greater
the protection afforded.

     b.   Planning Considerations.

            (1)    Commanders should consider a number of factors in planning for the
installation or upgrade of fixed site COLPRO facilities. For example, COLPRO systems
employ a filter unit capable of removing agents from the air being circulated through the
filter and, as a general rule, also employ some type of temperature management system for
the comfort of the personnel in the shelter.

                              Figure VII-1. General Layout for an NBC Shelter




                                                                                               VII-5
           (2)     A building or other facility employed as a CB shelter can be likened to a
leaky boat. The safety afforded depends on the rate of leaks—in this case, leaks of air. The
rate of leaking in relation to its volume is the air exchange rate, which is the rate of
uncontrolled exchange of air between the inside and the outside. This air exchange rate
determines how rapidly airborne contaminants infiltrate the structure from the outside and
how rapidly they are purged from the building once the outside air is no longer
contaminated.

           (3)    Air exchange rates vary, not only from structure to structure but also for
a given structure over time. Some of the variables which influence air exchange rates are—

                   • Wind Velocity and Direction. The air exchange rate increases as wind
speeds increase. Wind produces a pressure difference between the outside and inside,
causing air to infiltrate through the windward side and exfiltrate on the opposite walls.

                  • Inside-Outside Temperature Differences. As the inside-outside
temperature difference increases, the air exchange rate increases. This difference is
manifested in pressure differences on the walls and doors according to height, which
increases the stack effect of agent infiltration.

                  • Ductwork Systems. Openings and crevices around heating,
ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) ductwork provide a major pathway for infiltration,
along with increases in air exchange rates when the system is operating.

                  • Combustion. The combustion process of heating a structure increases
the air exchange from the outside into the structure.

                 • Seasonal Variations. Air exchange rates are highest in the winter and
lowest in the summer. Building materials contract and expand due to moisture and
temperature changes.

                 • Upstairs/Downstairs. Air exchange rates can be higher downstairs
than upstairs, and higher agent concentrations will likely occur on lower floors.

                  • Room Variations. Air exchange rates vary among rooms due to
structure design, construction materials, orientation to the wind, and the location of outside
walls.

           (4)    CW experiments demonstrated that over time, the dosage inside a
building approaches the dosage outside if there is no substantial loss of agent to materials
absorption. A closed building dampens the rapid fluctuations in concentration caused by the
random variability inherent in atmospheric diffusion, protecting occupants from exposure
to high peak concentrations. If the shelter exchange rate remains constant, it will take
longer to purge the contaminant after a cloud has passed than it took for the contaminant
to enter the building. At some point during the cloud or after it passes, the concentration
inside may exceed the contamination level outside. Therefore, the building ventilation
should be turned off prior to the arrival of a cloud (to minimize the intake of the agent) and
activated after the cloud passes (to help rid the structure of any vapor).




VII-6
      c.  Facility Suitability for COLPRO. In general, most facilities can be used for
COLPRO. In some cases, extensive modifications will be required. Prior to the installation
of systems, consideration must be given to the following:

            (1)    Tightness of facilities. The suitability of a building or shelter for positive-
pressure COLPRO is determined by the leakage rate of the building. Ideally, the flow rate
of filtered outside air to achieve a required overpressure should be no more than that
needed for the health and comfort of the occupants (e.g., 20 cubic feet per minute [CFM] per
person). Building tightness can vary greatly with the condition of the building and its
design defects, such as unsealed construction openings, drop ceilings, and false walls. Focus
should be on reducing the air leakage from a building.

           (2)     Methods of tightening the building. When a collectively protected
building is pressurized, its protection envelope must be tightened by closing all intentional
openings (e.g., outside air vents, exhaust vents, windows, and doors). Other openings (e.g.,
cracks, crevices, joints, and penetrations for pipes and cables) must be closed to the
maximum extent feasible. Caulking and weather stripping provide other means to tighten
the structure.

     d.    Protective Entrances. A protective-shelter entrance provides an interface
between the contaminated environment and the protected enclosure. It enables shelter
users to remove contaminated clothing and perform decontamination procedures, providing
them a relatively clean environment before entry into the shelter. See Appendix B for
information on specific types of protective-shelter entrances.

      e.   Shelter Equipment. Generally, significant efforts are required to integrate filter
units with HVAC systems. Often, the least costly approach for hazard reduction is to turn
off the HVAC system and block the supply and return vents to the protected area when the
system is pressurized. Such measures would likely require alternate heating or cooling
methods. See Appendix B for information on shelter equipment that can be used to
establish protective shelters.

     f.    Shelter Equipment Characteristics.

             (1)   Overpressure levels. The minimum overpressure recommended for
stationary COLPRO shelters is 0.1-inches water gauge (iwg) or 25 pascals in entry areas
and 0.2 iwg in the main shelter areas. This standard is based on preventing air infiltration
at ambient wind speeds greater than 15 miles per hour (mph). At 15 mph, the wind
reduces the concentration and dosage of mustard evaporating from the ground by about 98
percent, compared with calm conditions. When preparing buildings and conducting test
measurements, it is advisable to provide for a higher pressurization (0.2 iwg) to ensure 0.1
iwg is still achieved over time, as sealing measures and building structures may
deteriorate.

           (2)   CCA. The CCA and air lock allow people to transition from individual
protection to COLPRO without introducing contaminants into the TFA. Personnel remove
their contaminated outer garments in the CCA before entering the air lock. Permanent or
interior CCAs have a filtered airflow rate sufficient to suppress vapor concentrations from
contaminated garments worn into the CCA. Open-air CCAs have high airflow rates, but



                                                                                             VII-7
the air may not be clean, filtered air. (Figure VII-2 shows a tent used as a CCA and
attached to the air lock.) Vapor sorption or the adherence of agent vapors to surrounding
materials/objects is the primary problem in most CCAs. See Appendix B for procedures on
how to transfer into a TFA.

           (3)    Integration of NBC detectors. The agent vapors in the open-air CCA can
actually adhere to the individual after he doffs the overgarment and before he enters the air
lock. There are four options for detecting and dealing with this problem:

                        •   Halt entry processing if vapor hazards are detected.

                        •   Use a chemical detector to screen/halt the entry of candidates with
desorbing vapor.

                  • Require removal of all garments if interior or exterior monitors detect
vapor, and issue new or temporary garments inside the TFA.

                        •   Combine showers with the previous options.
Note: Using M8 paper to check for contamination prior to shelter entry is undesirable as a
preentry screening tool unless driven by operational requirements.
     g.    Classes of Fixed-Site COLPRO. For fixed-site COLPRO facilities, classes of
protection are defined according to the degree of protection provided and the extent of the
expected hazard. In addition to criteria for classification standards, the expected threat
determines whether a protective system should be designed to operate continuously or on a
standby basis. These classes are—

             •       Class I, pressurized shelters.

             •      Class II, intermediate shelters.

             •      Class III, passive shelters.

        h.       Sheltering in Place.




VII-8
            (1)    Background. Sheltering in place reduces but does not eliminate the risk of
exposure to CB agents. Sheltering is an alternative to evacuation. Sheltering in place has a
role in the commander’s planning process because evacuation for some groups may not be
feasible or possible. Adequate pressurized shelters may not be available. Likewise, the
amount of forewarning of impending agent contamination may not be adequate for
evacuation.

             (2)    Concept. The concept of sheltering in place is to go indoors (to higher
floors, if possible), close all openings to the outside, and attempt to restrict the exchange of
air from the outside to the inside. These preparations should be accomplished before the
arrival of a contaminant cloud. Given adequate warning, additional measures should be
taken, such as sealing openings with plastic sheeting and tape and use of IPE is still
required to minimize the risk of exposure; however, not all personnel in the downwind
hazard area (e.g., civilians) may have the required IPE. The amount of protection afforded
by sheltering in place varies with the air exchange factors previously discussed. Based on
the levels of sealing, there are four levels of sheltering in place:

              •       Normal sheltering. Close all windows and doors, and turn off all
HVAC equipment.

                 • Expedient sheltering. Take rapid measures to enhance protection,
such as taping doors, windows, and electrical outlets and placing rolled, wet towels at the
bases of doors.

               • Enhanced sheltering. Caulk joints, apply weather strips, install storm
windows, and make other modifications to reduce air infiltration.

                  • Pressurized sheltering. Use gas-particulate filter blowers to increase
the inside pressure so that it exceeds the outside pressure and provide filtered air.

          (3)     Expedient Sealing Measures. The procedures of expedient sheltering are
based on an assumption that there are techniques that can be applied with little or no
training and with commonly available materials to reduce the air exchange rate. Selecting
and sealing one room can also provide a higher protection level by reducing the air
exchange rate. Testing has indicated that a room sealed with plastic sheeting and tape
provides 10 times the protection than sealing the entire house.

          (4)     Implementation. The implementation of sheltering in place requires
planning to—

                  •   Ensure that occupants know how to take protective measures.

                  •   Determine that a CB release has occurred.

                  •   Determine areas that may be affected by the release.

                  •   Communicate a timely warning to all people in the affected areas.

                  •   Communicate the appropriate time to vacate in-place shelters.



                                                                                             VII-9
                • Turn off the HVAC systems prior to the arrival of the cloud, and
activate the HVAC systems after the cloud passes.

           (5)    Instructions. Basic guidance for sheltering in place includes three core
steps: close windows and doors, turn off HVAC, and stay indoors and stand by for further
instructions. Table VII-1 provides examples of instructions that can be used for sheltering
in place.

4.       Transportable Collective Protection
      Transportable COLPRO provides the commander with another means of providing a
clean air shelter for use against CBR particles. Transportable COLPRO systems employ the
principle of pressurized, purified air to provide a contamination-free environment in which
to work. The system does not protect against gamma radiation or neutrons. The air
pressure precludes the leakage of contaminated air into the enclosure. Personnel enter and
exit through a protective entrance. The protective entrance is an air lock, which prevents
contamination from entering the enclosure. Transportable COLPRO can be used for rest
and relief, C2, light maintenance, and MTFs.
         a.   Modular COLPRO Equipment.



VII-10
             (1)   Modular (transportable) COLPRO provides commanders with the
flexibility to move COLPRO to sites where it is needed. The system includes an array of
equipment, consisting of gas particulate filter units (GPFUs), protective entrances, and
various installation kits.

           (2)     Modules can be grouped to provide space as dictated by the tactical
situation. Modular COLPRO systems could include wheel or tracked vehicles, expandable
vans, or a series of vans that are linked.

      b.   Transportable Systems. The commander decides whether to use transportable
COLPRO assets. The basis for the decision is the determination that tasks, such as C² relief
from MOPP gear, is mission-essential. When a CP system is used for rest and relief, the
commander must ensure coordination of MOPP gear resupply and security. Shelters used
for personnel relief and medical treatment require a great number of entry and exits. In
addition, personnel must continuously monitor shelter operations. This monitoring ensures
that the system functions properly and that no contaminants have entered the system.

            (1)     M20A1 Simplified COLPRO Equipment. The M20A1 SCPE is an updated
version of the M20. Both systems are still in the inventory. The SCPE provides a clean-air
shelter for use against CW and BW agents and radioactive particles. It is lightweight, is
mobile, and allows unit commanders to convert existing structures into protected command,
control, and operations centers. The SCPE can be used as a temporary rest-and-relief
shelter (e.g., a break area for personnel working in heavy maintenance and supply
operations or medical minimum-care wards at the combat support hospital [CSH]) or as a
C2 center. It provides a contamination-free environment in which 10 persons can work, eat,
and rest without the encumbrance of the IPE. The M20A1 consists of a large, cylindrical-
shaped liner designed to be inflated inside a room or building. A support kit contains a
motor blower for inflation and flexible air ducts to direct the air. The M20A1 can be erected
without the liner using only the protective entrance and blower compartment. A bib section
is available that fits between the protective entrance and the frame of any door; and when
taped down, it seals the entrance from outside contamination.

           (2)     M28 Simplified COLPRO Equipment. The M28 SCPE is a highly
transportable COLPRO system used in conjunction with the tent, extendable, modular,
personnel (TEMPER). The modular system consists of agent-resistant liner sections, a
protective entrance, a tunnel air lock for litter patients, a hermetically sealed NBC filter
canister, a recirculation filter, and a support kit containing a motor blower and ancillary
equipment.

           (3)   TEMPER. This system provides the commander with the flexibility of
tailoring COLPRO to the tactical situation. This modular shelter is available in sections
that can be assembled to provide space as required. The M28 SCPE can be used to provide
the required NBC protection. (Note: The vinyl-coated polyester fabric used in the TEMPER
and most other military tents can cause false positive readings with the ICAM, especially in
newly issued tents.)

       (4)     Chemically Protected Deployable Medical Systems (CP DEPMEDS). The
CP DEPMEDS provides COLPRO to the core components of DEPMEDS CSHs. CP
DEPMEDS will provide a clean, toxic-free, environmentally controlled patient treatment



                                                                                          VII-11
area necessary to sustain medical operations in toxic environments. CP DEPMEDS
accommodates an NBC casualty surge and provides environmental control, while
maintaining the ability to resupply during a 72-hour mission. In addition, CP DEPMEDS
provides NBC-protected water and low-pressure alarms and contains lavatory/latrine
facilities for patients and staff.

           (5)     The Chemical and Biological Protective Shelter (CBPS). The CBPS
provides an environmentally controlled, toxic free work area. The shelter can serve as a
battalion aid station, a clearing station, and a forward surgical team treatment facility in a
contaminated environment. The shelter is transported on a high-mobility, multipurpose,
wheeled vehicle (HMMWV). It has a 300-square-foot tent that are supported by air beams
that are inflated with air to form a semicircular shape that can be rolled and transported.
The vehicle provides power to support system operation.

5.       Mobile Collective Protection
      Mobile CPE provides protection to a group of individuals under NBC conditions. Table
VII-2 depicts the types of mobile COLPRO systems found on vehicles and aircraft.
Personnel in mobile CPE are protected and may operate at the reduced MOPP levels shown
in Table VII-3 (page VII-14). When an attack occurs, those personnel who are not protected
by COLPRO should activate the CP system and assume MOPP4. They must remain at that
level until the shelter interior is purged. Required purge times vary with the interior
shelter volume and the airflow. Check specific technical publications for each system. When
the required purge time passes, personnel should follow unmasking procedures. When the
all-clear signal is given, personnel may resume the modified MOPP levels shown in Table
VII-3 (page VII-14).
     a.    Mobile COLPRO Systems (Air/Land). There are four basic types of air and land
mobile COLPRO systems. The types are classified according to the degree of protection they
provide and the manner in which they are integrated into the host system. They include
ventilated-facepiece, overpressure, hybrid, and total systems.

            (1)     Ventilated-Facepiece Systems. Ventilated-facepiece systems supply
filtered air to the protective-mask canisters. The systems are designed to connect to GPFU
and are rated by their airflow capacity in CFM. The components of these systems are
similar. The filtered, pressurized air supplied to individuals extends MOPP gear
capabilities. It reduces breathing resistance through the masks, and it aids in sweat
evaporation. In addition, it can provide warm air to facepieces in cold weather.

                         cooling.

           (2)     Overpressure System. An overpressure system is an enclosure of
pressurized purified air. Gas and particulate filters remove any NBC contamination from
the air. The air pressure precludes leakage of contaminated air into the enclosure.




                                                                                                               VII-13

  During an engagement, the commander may allow personnel protected for liquid agents to operate temporarily
without protective gloves. This option could slightly increase the potential for casualties. Normally, personnel in
COLPRO facilities will don their protective masks (at least) during an attack until it is verified that the integrity of the
shelter or filtration system was not damaged.
2
 MOPP gear could include the JSLIST. If the JSLIST is worn at the appropriate MOPP level, pull the hood over the
head and secure the mask. Close the slide fastener completely, and secure the hook-and-pile fastener up to the
top of the slide fastener. Place the edge of the hood around the edge of the mask, and secure the hook-and-pile
fastener.

           (3)   Hybrid System. Hybrid systems combine positive pressure and the
ventilated facemask inside the enclosure with the option of using positive pressure, the
ventilated facemask, or both. The positive pressure reduces the amount of vapor
contamination that enters. If contamination enters, the system helps purge the interior of
toxic vapors.

            (4)     Total System. A total system combines overpressure and environmental
control to provide a pressurized, cooled, NBC-protected environment not dependent on
individual protection. Cooling reduces heat stress for personnel operating in extremely hot
and/or humid conditions. MOPP gear significantly increases the potential for heat stress,
making cooling systems desirable. Crew compartment cooling provides air-conditioning to
the compartment, and individual cooling proves effective when used while MOPP gear is
worn. The choice of cooling systems depends on the vehicle type and the primary mission.
The overpressure and cooling systems reduce heat stress casualties; however, they increase
the logistical burden, primarily because of maintenance. Vehicles such as the MlA1 Abrams
main battle tank (MBT) have overpressure systems. In addition to the overpressure system,
the crews are provided a ventilated facepiece. During closed-hatch operations, the system
provides positive pressure and crew cooling. During open-hatch operations, the system
provides cool, filtered air to the ventilated facepiece and the cooling vest. During open-hatch



VII-14
operations, personnel must be masked before exiting the vehicle to prevent any possibility
of chemical agent exposure. Additionally, during open-hatch operations, the system
provides modest overpressure that significantly reduces the amount of contamination
infiltrating the crew compartment. Consequently, the time required to purge contamination
is reduced.

      b.   Risk Assessment. Commanders must carefully plan for both the benefits of
COLPRO and for the additional restrictions and limitations placed on the individuals and
crews by its use. Depending on the type of COLPRO, individuals and crews can work longer
and more comfortably while in COLPRO, thus increasing the efficiency and combat
capability of the individuals or crews. The commander must, however, understand the
restrictions imposed by employing COLPRO and the loss of system efficiency and capability
due to the time and procedures required to employ it. Additionally, the restrictions on
personnel dexterity, vision, and task performance and the time and effort required to enter
and exit from a system in a contaminated environment must be considered. Table VII-4
shows the advantages and disadvantages of various mobile COLPRO systems.

6.       Navy Collective Protection Systems (Surface Ship)

           COLPRO is the use of shipboard equipment and operations to provide a toxic-
free environment. COLPRO aboard surface vessels depends on the type of vessel. In
general, those vessels in which some type of COLPRO is installed will have either portions
of the vessel or the entire vessel adapted for COLPRO.

      a.   Ventilation Systems. All ships have ventilation systems that provide fresh air
throughout the vessel. Ship ventilation systems are effective in stopping large particles but
are ineffective in stopping aerosol and vapor contaminants. The entry of these
contaminants can be minimized by shutting as many closures as possible. One
countermeasure, Circle William, which is the closure of all outside openings, is taken to
prevent contaminants from entering the compartments. Even when countermeasures have
been taken, it is likely that some vapor contaminants will enter the interior of the ship.
Ventilation systems are effective in removing vapor contaminants by exchanging the air
within compartments. This process, called purging, is quite effective. For example, one
change of air will remove one-half of the contaminants. Six changes of air will remove
almost all of the contaminants. For those vessels that have COLPRO systems, all or part of
the vessel will contain the components necessary to provide the COLPRO. The system will
include the areas that have overpressure capability, fans, filters, air locks, and
decontamination stations.

      b.   Shipboard Collective Protection System. The CP system aboard many ships is an
installed ventilation system that sends filtered air to designated zones for protection
against toxic agents. The zones are contiguous spaces, which share common boundaries—
such as hull frames, bulkheads, decks, and accesses. Air locks, pressure locks, and
decontamination stations maintain the integrity of the toxic-free environment and allow
personnel to enter and exit the collective zones. CP systems can provide total or limited
protection. Total protection provides an IPE-free environment. Ships with limited
protection provide protection from liquid chemical agents; however, a mask must be worn
since protection from vapors is not provided. Following a chemical attack, ships with
limited protection must move to a contamination-free area for purging of the compartments.
NWP 3-20.31, Revision A, Surface Ship Survivability provides details on ship COLPRO
employment. The specifics of a particular ship COLPRO system and its operation are
contained in the ship CBR defense bill.

        NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, AND CHEMICAL PROTECTIVE
                         EQUIPMENT


1.   Background

     Appendix A provides additional information that supplements earlier descriptions of
IPE and masks. It describes items such as protective clothing, masks, TIM protective
equipment, decontamination, detection, medical, and other related items (e.g., chemical-
agent monitors/alarms and radiac equipment/dosimeters). For detailed information on the
employment and use of the NBC protective equipment (such as detectors), see the
applicable TTP and service-specific technical publications.

2.   Protective Clothing

      a.   Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology Chemical Protective
Overgarment. The JSLIST (hereafter referred to as the CPO) has a service life of 120 days,
of which 45 days is the maximum wear time. The CPO service life begins when the garment
is removed from the factory vacuum-sealed bag. It can be laundered up to six times for
personal-hygiene purposes and provides 24 hours of protection against liquid, solid, and/or
vapor CB attacks. It also provides protection against radioactive alpha and beta particles.
Wear time for the CPO begins when it is removed from its factory vacuum-sealed bag and
stops when the garment is sealed back into its zipper-locked bag. Donning of the CPO
(regardless of the time) equates to a day of wear. To ensure serviceability, personnel
conduct operator or shipboard preventive maintenance checks and services (PMCS).
Damaged CPO CP ensemble items may be retained only for training purposes. CB
protection provided by the CPO is dangerously degraded if an area of the ensemble is wet
through the inner lining with petroleum products, perspiration, urine, feces, or many
common insect repellents. If the overgarment becomes wet through the inner lining with
any of these materials, replace it as soon as possible. All services use the CPO.

      b.     Chemical Protective Undergarment. The CPU is a two-piece undergarment
consisting of a formfitting undershirt and drawers. The CPU is not removed from its bag
until it is needed for use. When the CPU is removed from its VB bag, its protective qualities
last for a minimum of 15 days. The wear time for the CPU begins when it is removed from
the VB bag. If the original bag is not available, use a replacement bag that, as a minimum,
is water-resistant or water-repellent. The CPU can be laundered once for personal-hygiene
purposes during its 15-day use. It provides protection from CB agents (solid, liquid, and
vapor) for up to a 12-hour period. The CPU also protects against radioactive alpha and beta
particles. When worn under a duty uniform, the CPU has also shown enhanced flash fire
protection capabilities. The CPU is generally used by SOF, explosive ordnance disposal
(EOD), technical escort, and depot personnel.

     c.    Battle Dress Overgarment. The BDO is a camouflage-colored (woodland or
desert), expendable, two-piece overgarment consisting of one coat and one pair of trousers.
The BDO presently comes sealed in a VB bag that protects against rain, moisture, and



                                                                                         A-1
sunlight. The BDO is water-resistant but not waterproof, and it is normally worn as an
outer garment. In extreme cold-weather environments, the BDO should be worn between
layer two (bib overall, cold-weather shirt, and trouser liner) and layer three (coat liner and
field trousers) of the ECWCS. In extreme cold-weather environments, the BDO is sized to
wear over arctic/extreme cold-weather environmental clothing; however, mission
requirements may dictate that the BDO be worn under arctic clothing. When the BDO is
removed from its VB bag and worn, it may be worn up to 22 days. Wear time can be
increased to 30 days, with slight increases in risk, at the discretion of the commander. Wear
time for the BDO begins when it is removed from its sealed VB bag and stops when the
BDO is sealed back in its VB bag. If the original VB bag is not available, return the BDO to
a similar material bag and seal it with common duct tape. Donning the BDO (regardless of
the time) equates to a day of wear. The BDO provides a minimum of 24 hours of protection
against exposure to CB agents (solid, liquid, and vapor) and radioactive alpha and beta
particles. While the BDO is not designed to be decontaminated or reimpregnated for reuse,
the use of the M291 skin decontamination kit (SDK)/M295 decontamination kit, individual
equipment (DKIE) on contaminated ensembles within 15 minutes of the time of exposure to
liquid chemical agents will essentially maintain full protective capabilities of the BDO. The
BDO becomes unserviceable if it is ripped or torn, a fastener is broken or missing, or POL
are spilled or splashed on the garment. Users conduct PMCS for the BDO according to
applicable service technical publications. The BDO is being replaced by the JSLIST
overgarment. All services use the BDO.

Note: If the original VB bag for clothing such as the JSLIST overgarment, CPU, or BDO, is
not available, use a replacement bag that is, as a minimum, is water-resistant or water
repellent.

     d.    A/P22P-9A (V) Below-the-Neck Protective Assembly. The A/P22P-9A (V) below-
the-neck protective assembly consists of the MK-1 flyer underall, cotton undershirt and
cotton drawers, CP socks, disposable footwear covers, aircrewman’s cape, and CP gloves
and glove inserts. The MK-1 flyer underall is a one-piece chemical liner made from nylon
viscose, nonwoven fabric treated with fluorochemical liquid repellent. The inner surface is
coated with activated charcoal. The cotton undershirt and drawers are worn under the
chemical liner to prevent skin irritation from the charcoal lining and to minimize
perspiration contamination of the chemical liner. The CP socks, made of 4-mil polyethylene,
are vapor-agent impermeable and protect feet from CB agents. The disposable footwear
covers are clear plastic, disposable (one-time use only) and are designed to protect feet from
contamination. The aircrewman’s cape is a large, clear, disposable plastic bag, designed to
be worn over the body to protect from liquid contamination. The standard CP gloves and
inserts are made of butyl rubber, 7-mil thick; and the standard white inserts are 100
percent cotton knit. The primary users include the USN and the USMC.

      e.   Wet-Weather Gear (see Figure A-1). Wet-weather gear provides an ensemble for
wear over IPE. Wet-weather gear provides initial protection against liquid CB agents and
radioactive alpha and beta particles in a cold and/or wet climate, both ashore and
shipboard. The wet weather gear is made of green, chloroprene-coated nylon. The jacket
style parka has a slide fastener with moisture barrier flaps, patch pockets, and a
permanently attached hood. All services use wet-weather gear.




A-2
                               Figure A-1. Wet-Weather Gear

     f.    Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Bag (see Figure A-2). The NBC equipment
protective bag is constructed of abrasion-resistant nylon and is designed to consolidate and
transport NBC defense items such as IPE components and decontamination kits. The bag
can no longer hold the entire IPE ensemble because of the change from CP footwear covers
to GVOs/BVOs. The bag comes in one size and has a four-color, woodland camouflage
pattern.




              Figure A-2. Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Equipment Bag

     g.     Suit, Contamination Avoidance and Liquid Protective. The SCALP is a four-
piece ensemble and consists of a jacket, trousers, and two footwear covers. It is designed to
be worn over the CPO (BDO or JSLIST) and CP overboots. The footwear covers have 12-mil
embossed polyethylene soles. The components provide protection from gross liquid
contamination for up to 1 hour. Users include land force elements such as EOD, technical
escorts, or medical units.

      h.   Apron, Toxicological Agent Protective, M2. The apron, toxicological agent
protective (TAP), M2 is intended for personnel whose duties may bring them into contact
with liquid CB agents. For example, those who work with toxic munitions, perform
decontamination in a field environment, handle contaminated clothing and equipment at a
decontamination site, and handle and treat chemical agent casualties could use this item of
clothing.

      i.   Self-Contained, Toxic-Environment Protective Outfit. The STEPO provides a
totally encapsulating protective ensemble for a TIC environment. The system can be
configured in three separate modes of operation, depending on the mission and user
requirements. STEPO includes a CP suit, a choice of breathing apparatuses (4-hour



                                                                                          A-3
rebreather, tethered air supply with emergency SCBA, and standalone 60-minute SCBA), a
battery-powered cooling system, and a hands-free communications system. The STEPO is
worn with the TAP boot, which fits over the integral booties of the STEPO CP suit. The
STEPO is used in extremely hazardous and/or oxygen-deficient environments where contact
with CW agents, POL, missile fuels, and/or TIC can occur. The system provides the wearer
with clean, closed-circuit breathing air and up to 4 hours of OSHA Level A protection. The
CP suit can be used five times after exposure to vapor contamination and decontamination
processes. If the suit is exposed to liquid contamination, it must be decontaminated and
disposed of in accordance with local procedures. The primary users of STEPO are EOD
specialists, technical escort personnel, and civilians engaged in chemical activity/depot
hazardous materials (HAZMAT) operations.

      j.    Chemical Protective Glove Set. The glove sets come in three thicknesses (7, 14,
and 25 mil). The 7-mil glove set is generally used by personnel whose tasks require extreme
tactility and/or sensitivity and who will not expose the gloves to harsh treatment. The 14-
mil glove set is used by personnel such as aviators, vehicle mechanics, and weapon crews
whose tasks require tactility and sensitivity and who will not expose the gloves to harsh
treatment. The more durable, 25-mil glove set is used by personnel who perform close
combat tasks and other types of heavy labor. The glove protects against CB agents and
alpha and beta radioactive particles as long as they remain serviceable. If the 14- and 25-
mil glove sets become contaminated with liquid chemical agents, decontaminate or replace
them within 24 hours after exposure. If the 7-mil glove set becomes contaminated, replace
or decontaminate them within 6 hours after exposure. The contaminated gloves may be
decontaminated with a 5 percent chlorine solution or a 5 percent HTH and water solution.
Primary users include all the services.

     k.     Green Vinyl Overshoe, Black Vinyl Overshoe, and Multipurpose Lightweight
Overboot. The GVO is a plain, olive drab (OD) green, vinyl overshoe with elastic fasteners.
The BVO is very similar to the GVO, except for the color and enlarged tabs on each elastic
fastener. Personnel can wear the GVO or BVO over their combat boots to protect their feet
from contamination by all known agents, vectors, and radiological particles (alpha and
beta) for a maximum of 60 days. Protection continues if the GVO/BVO remains serviceable.
Wearing the GVO/BVO with combat boots provides 24 hours of protection against all known
CB agents following contamination. Decontaminate the GVO/BVO with a 5 percent HTH
and water solution or a 5 percent household bleach and water solution. If signs of
deterioration occur following decontamination, replace the overshoe. The MULO is also
designed to be worn over combat boots, jungle boots, and intermediate cold/wet boots. The
MULO provides 60 days of durability and 24 hours of protection against CB agents. The
primary users include all services.

      l.    Chemical Protective Footwear Cover. The CPFC is impermeable and protects
feet from CB agents, vectors, and radiological dust particles for a minimum of 24 hours, as
long as it remains serviceable. CPFCs can be decontaminated using a 5 percent chlorine
solution. The USN continues to use the CPFC.

     m. Chemical Protective Helmet Cover (see Figure A-3). The chemical protective
helmet cover is a one-piece configuration made of butyl-coated nylon cloth and gathered at
the opening by elastic webbing enclosed in the hem. The cover comes in one size and is OD




A-4
green color. The helmet cover protects the helmet from CB contamination and radioactive
alpha and beta particles. The primary users include USA and USMC units.




                      Figure A-3. Chemical Protective Helmet Cover

      n.   Joint Firefighter Integrated Response Ensemble. The joint firefighter integrated
response ensemble (J-FIRE) configuration consists of a chemical protective overgarment
(JSLIST), a firefighter proximity suit, a hood, a modified structural helmet, CB butyl
rubber gloves with liners, fire-protective gloves, fire-protective boots, a SCBA with a CW
kit, and a carrying bag. The J-FIRE ensemble may contain a proximity glove with built-in
CP features instead of the separate butyl rubber and fire-protective gloves. The primary
users include special-purpose teams such as firefighters.

     o.    NBC Protective Cover. The NBC protective cover is a lightweight cover for use
in preventing liquid contamination of supplies and equipment. The cover also provides a
barrier between covered supplies and liquid agents and radioactive dust. Protection time
against liquid agents is 48 hours. The cover can provide protection for up to 6 weeks
without agent exposure before it begins to break down due to environmental conditions.

3.   Protective Masks

     The field protective masks described in this paragraph are not authorized for use in
TIC environments, because many TIC, such as carbon monoxide, are oxygen-depleting.
These masks are not effective in certain spaces when the oxygen content in the air is too
low. Standard eyeglasses or contact lenses cannot be worn with these masks (except for the
M43). Therefore, individuals must obtain optical inserts for their masks. Proper PMCS is
essential to ensure serviceability.
       a.   Chemical-Biological Mask: Field M40-series. The M40-series CB mask consists of
a silicone rubber facepiece with a binocular eyelens system and an elastic head harness.
Other features include front and side voicemitters (allowing better contact, particularly
when operating communications equipment), a drinking tube, clear and tinted inserts, and
a filter canister with NATO standard threads. The M40A1 mask provides respiratory, eye,
and face protection against CB agents, radioactive fallout particles, and battlefield
contaminants. The canister filter cannot be changed in a contaminated environment; the
mask was not designed for that contingency. Additionally, the M40A1 mask uses a second
skin for additional protection, and also has a quick-doff hood. The primary users include
USA and USMC units, and the mask is selectively used by USN personnel.



                                                                                        A-5
      b.   Chemical-Biological Mask: Combat Vehicle M42A2. The M42A2 CB mask has the
same components as the M40. In addition, the M42A2 CVC mask has a detachable
microphone for wire communications. The canister on the M42A2 mask is attached to the
end of a hose and has an adapter for connection to a GPFU. The M40/M42-series masks
also use the same filter canister with NATO standard threads, both use a second skin for
additional protection, and both have a quick-doff hood. The primary users include USA and
USMC units.

      c.    Chemical-Biological Mask: Aircrew Aviator M45. The M45 aircrew mask
provides respiratory, eye, and face protection. The M45 aircrew mask protects the user
against all known CB agents and radiological particles without the aid of forced-air
ventilation, while maintaining compatibility with rotary-winged aircraft sighting systems
and night vision devices (NVDs). The mask provides a microphone, a drinking tube, close-
fitting eyelenses, front and side voicemitters for face-to-face and phone communications,
and a low-profile canister interoperability hose assembly for both hose and face-mounted
configurations. The mask also comes with a hood and a second skin. The M45 mask is used
to support service personnel who cannot be fitted with the standard M40-series or MCU-
2A/P series protective masks. The primary users include USA and USMC units.

      d.   Chemical-Biological Mask: Aircraft M43. The M43 mask provides the required
CB agent protection and allows for compatability with the AH-64 attack helicopter helmet,
the display sighting system, and the optical relay tube. The mask comes with a portable
blower/filter system that operates on battery or aircraft power to maintain positive pressure
in the facepiece and an inhalation air distribution assembly for regulating the flow of air.
Additionally, the mask provides for external voice or wire communications and a drink tube
assembly. The primary users include USA AH-64 helicopter aviators.

      e.   Chemical-Biological Mask: M48. The M48 CB aircraft mask was developed for
the AH-64 Apache helicopter aviators. It provides face, eye, and respiratory protection
against CB agents and radioactive particles. The M48 mask has a lightweight motor blower
that is mounted on the user during dismounted operations and is mounted to the airframe
during flight operations. The motor blower provides filtered, breathable air that keeps the
head cool and prevents the eyelens from fogging. While wearing the M48 mask,
crewmembers can perform their missions in an NBC environment inside or outside the
aircraft. The M48 will replace the M43 mask, which is worn by Apache helicopter aviators.

     f.    Aircrew Eye/Respiratory Protection (see Figure A-4). The aircrew
eye/respiratory protection (AERP) is a protective mask that enables USAF aircrews to
conduct mission operations in a CB environment. The AERP system includes a protective
hood assembly with a standard MBU-13/P mask, an intercom for ground communications,
and a blower assembly that provides demisting. The blower is stowed during flight
operations on a bracket that is mounted inside the aircraft. It replaces the MBU-13/P
system for aviators. The primary users include USAF units.

                      Figure A-4. Aircrew Eye/Respiratory Protection

      g.    CB Respiratory System (A/P 22P-14[V] Nondevelopmental Item [NDI]). The CB
respiratory system is a self-contained, protective ensemble designed for all forward
deployed rotary wing (Version 1 for USN) and fixed wing (Versions 2 through 4 for USN
and USMC) aircrews. The design incorporates a CB filter, dual air/oxygen supply, a
crossover manifold with a ground flight selector switch to filter air for hood ventilation, and
filtered air for breathing. The A/P 22P-14(V) 1 is for helicopter use and is not compatible
with aircraft with oxygen delivery systems. The A/P 22P-14(V) 2 is used on EA-6B and F-
18A aircraft. The A/P 22 P-14 (V) 3 is used on AV-8B and F-18C/D aircraft, and the A/P
22P-14(V) 4 is used for C130 crews. The primary users include USN and USMC aircrews.

      h.   MCU-2A/P Protective Mask. The MCU-2A/P mask (see Figure A-5 [page A-8])
(with a serviceable canister filter installed) protects the face, eyes, and respiratory tract
from CW and BW agents and radioactive dust particles. A properly worn mask provides
USN and USAF personnel with a gas-tight face seal, which prevents unfiltered air from
reaching the wearer’s respiratory system. An internal microphone may be placed inside the
mask and connected to an external communications system through a connector on the
front voicemitter. The major components of the MCU-2A/P mask include an outlet valve
assembly, an outlet valve cover, a drinking tube, a nosecup, an inlet valve, lens outserts,
and a canister. The accessories for the MCU-2A/P mask include a mask carrier, a protective
hood, mask outserts, and a special canteen drinking cap. The primary user includes USN
and USAF personnel.




                                                                                            A-7
                          Figure A-5. MCU-2A/P Protective Mask

     i.    MCU-2/P Protective Mask. The MCU-2/P-series protective mask is the eye
respiratory protection equipment used shipboard for CBR defense. It has a single filter and
two voicemitters—one on the front of the mask for speaking directly into a telephone or
radio handset and one at the side to allow personnel nearby to hear. The mask has a
drinking tube that connects to a canteen with an M1 canteen cap. The MCU-2/P is being
phased out and replaced by the MCU-2A/P-series protective mask. The primary users
include the USN and USAF.

     j.   M17A1/M17A2-Series Field Protective Mask. The M17A1/M17A2-series CB
mask, with the M6A2 hood, protects against field concentrations of all known CB agents in
vapor or aerosol form. The mask is no longer standard issue for military personnel;
however, it could still be used for issue to civilians during missions such as noncombatant
evacuation operations (NEOs).

      k.   Joint Service General Purpose Mask. The joint service general-purpose mask
(JSGPM) will eventually replace the M40/M42/MCU-2/P-series masks. The JSGPM will
provide face, eye, and respiratory protection from battlefield concentrations of CB agents,
TIM, and radioactive particulate matter. It will also provide improved protection for
selected TIC.

      l.    M41 Protection Assessment Test System (see Figure A-6). The M41 protection
assessment test system (PATS) is designed to check the readiness of protective masks and
to verify that a protective mask, while worn by an individual, is capable of providing the
required fit factor/protection factor (PF). The PATS verifies that the fit of the mask to the
person’s face is acceptable and that there are no critical leaks in the mask system. In
addition to these features, the PATS can also be used to help screen for unserviceable
masks, to assist in determining if PMCS have been conducted properly on critical
components, and to assist in training personnel on the proper wear of the mask. The PATS
is currently used by USA, USMC, and USAF units. Additionally, the PATS requires
periodic calibration, and the calibration is scheduled and coordinated through service
logistics channels.

      m. Mask Leakage Tester, TDA-99M. The TDA-99M is a one-man, portable, unit-
level system that is capable of determining serviceability, checking PMCS adequacy, and
identifying defective components of protective masks. Users include USA, USN, USAF, and
USMC units.

      n.   Voice Communication Adapter. The voice communication adapter (VCA) is a low-
risk program providing additional voice amplification capability to the M40/M42 mask. The
VCA is a joint program between the USA and the USMC.

     o.   Universal Second Skin. The universal second skin is one of the components of a
preplanned product improvement (P3I) in the M40/M42 series mask. The universal second
skin provides liquid agent protection for the mask faceblank material. The primary users
include USA and USMC units.

     p.    NBC Protection Items Stowed in the Carrier, Protective Mask. Each branch of
service will specify what items are to be carried for the protection of their personnel based
on associated missions. Generally, current mask carriers accommodate three NAAKs, M8
detector paper, a technical reference, a mask hood (mounted on the mask in most cases),
mask outserts (mounted on the mask in most cases), a waterproof bag, a canteen cap, and
personal and equipment decontaminating kit (M291 SDK and/or M295 DKIE).

4.   Toxic Industrial Material Protection

     a.    Level A. The Level A protective suit provides the greatest level of skin and
respiratory protection. It consists of a totally encapsulating suit with gloves and boots
attached. A SCBA is worn inside the suit or a supplied-air system is used for respiratory
protection. Two pairs of gloves, latex and chemical-resistant, are worn under the suit
gloves. Chemical-resistant boots are worn over the suit boots. A radio may be worn under
the suit. Optional items, such as hard hats, cooling vests, and kneepads, may be worn. This
ensemble should be worn when the highest level of respiratory, skin, and eye protection is
required.




                                                                                           A-9
      b.   Level B. Level B protection should be considered when the highest level of
respiratory protection is needed, but with a lesser level of skin and eye protection. This
level consists of nonencapsulating, chemical-resistant suits, often called splash suits or rain
suits. Level B comes in several configurations, none of which are vapor-tight. A SCBA is
worn inside or outside the suit, depending on the configuration. Chemical-resistant outer
boots are worn, and three pairs of gloves may be used. Latex inner gloves are worn under
the chemical-resistant gloves. A pair of chemical-resistant outer gloves may cover both of
these for additional protection. Level B is the minimum level recommended for initial site
entry until all hazards have been identified and are being monitored.

      c.   Level C. Level C protection can be selected when the airborne substance is
known and is being monitored. All criteria must be met for the use of air-purifying
respirators (APR), and the proper filters for the known hazard present. Air monitoring
must continue throughout the operation to ensure that Level C protection remains effective
for the environment. An escape mask should be worn in case of a change in conditions that
make the air-purifying respirator ineffective. This escape mask will provide protection to
the responder during movement to the decontamination line without risking exposure. The
Level C ensemble consists of a full facepiece, an air-purifying respirator, and a chemical
agent-resistant suit. A chemical agent-resistant hood, apron, boots, and gloves should also
be worn. The gloves are layered the same as for Level B. Level C protection is similar to
that of MOPP 4 in a chemical weapons environment.

      d.   Level D. The Level D protective ensemble is the work uniform. Level D does not
provide any respiratory or skin protection and should not be used at an incident site that
presents these hazards. The military BDU or coveralls meet the requirements for this level
of protection.

5.     Decontamination Equipment

     a.    M291 Skin Decontamination Kit. The M291 kit consists of a wallet-like carrying
pouch containing six individual decontamination packets, enough to do three complete skin
decontaminations. The kit allows personnel to decontaminate their skin through physical
removal, absorption, or neutralization of toxic agents with no long-term harmful effects.
The kit is used for external use only and may be slightly irritating to eyes or skin.
Personnel must ensure that they keep the decontamination powder out of eyes, cuts, or
wounds and avoid inhalation of the powder. The primary users include all services.

     b.    M295 Decontamination Kit, Individual Equipment. The M295 kit allows
personnel to decontaminate their individual equipment through physical removal and
sorption of chemical agents. (Note: The M295 kit can decontaminate approximately 1,200
square feet.) Decontamination is accomplished through sorption of contamination by both
the kit nonwoven polyester pad and by the decontaminating powder. (Note: It is not
approved for skin decontamination.) Decontaminating the CB protective mask/hood,
gloves, footwear, weapon, helmet, and load-bearing equipment (LBE) preclude agent
transfer during the overgarment exchange and entry or exit procedures. The primary users
include all services.

     c.    Sorbent Decontamination System (SDS) M100. The M100 SDS is intended to
replace the M11s and M13s currently employed in operator spray-down operations


A-10
associated with immediate decontamination. (Note: It is not approved for skin
decontamination.) The system uses powdered sorbent to remove chemical agents from
surfaces. The reactive sorbent is nontoxic and noncorrosive, and it requires no water to
complete its mission. The SDS is designed to operate at temperatures between –25 and 120
degrees F.

      d.    ABC-M11 Portable Decontaminating Apparatus (see Figure A-7). The ABC-M11
portable decontaminating apparatus decontaminates small areas, such as steering wheels
or other equipment-operating areas with which personnel may have contact. It is a steel
container with an aluminum spray head assembly and a nitrogen gas cylinder that provides
the pressure. It is filled with 1 1/3 quarts of DS2 decontaminating solution, which is
sufficient for decontaminating 135 square feet of surface area. The effective spray range is 6
to 8 feet. The primary users include USA and USMC units.

6.     Chemical Detector Paper/Kits

      a.    M8 Chemical Agent Detector Paper. M8 paper is used to detect the presence of
liquid V type nerve, G type nerve, and H type blister agents. When a sheet is brought in
contact with liquid nerve or blister agents, it reacts with chemicals in the paper to produce
agent-specific color changes. The paper is blotted on a suspected liquid agent and observed
for a color change (liquid agent absorption). V type nerve agents turn the paper dark green;
G type nerve agents turn it yellow, and blister agents (H) turn it red. The paper cannot be
used to detect chemical agents in water, vapor, or aerosols. The primary users include all
services.

     b.    M9 Chemical Agent Detector Paper. M9 paper is placed on personnel and
equipment to identify the presence of liquid chemical agent aerosols. It will turn pink, red,
reddish brown, or red-purple when exposed to liquid agents. It can detect (but not identify)
the specific agent. As soon as it indicates the presence of chemical agents, protective action
must be taken. The primary users include all services.

      c.    M256A1 Chemical Agent Detector Kits. The M256A1 is a portable, expendable
item that is capable of detecting and identifying hazardous concentrations of chemical
agents. It is used after a chemical attack to determine if it is safe to unmask or reduce the
protective posture level. It also determines the type of agent present and helps confirm the
presence or absence of hazardous concentrations of an agent. Each kit can be used to test
for blister agents, blood agents, nerve agents, and lewisite. Each test spot or detecting
tablet develops a distinctive color that indicates whether a chemical agent is or is not
present in the air. The primary users include all services.

7.     First Aid Equipment

      a.    Nerve Agent Antidote Kit, Mark I. Nerve agent poisoning requires immediate
first aid treatment. Personnel receive three NAAKs, Mark I, for this purpose. Personnel
may become subject to nerve agent poisoning on the battlefield. Immediate treatment with
the NAAK is required if they are to survive. The NAAK consists of one small autoinjector
containing atropine and a second autoinjector containing pralidoxime chloride. A plastic
clip holds the two injectors together. Store the NAAK in the accessory storage pocket inside
the mask carrier. Protect the NAAK from freezing. See FM 8-285/Navy Medical (NAVMED)
P-5041/Air Force Joint Manual (AFJMAN) 44-149/MCRP 4-11.1A, Treatment of Chemical



A-12
Agent Casualties and Conventional Military Injuries, for more information on the NAAK.
The NAAK can also be issued in a Mark II configuration. The two autoinjectors are issued
without the plastic clip to hold them together.

      b.    Antidote Treatment, Nerve Agent Autoinjector. Nerve agent poisoning requires
immediate first aid treatment. Personnel receive three antidote treatment, nerve agent
autoinjectors (ATNAAs) for this purpose. Because personnel may become subjected to
nerve agent poisoning on the battlefield, immediate treatment with the ATNAA is required
if they are to survive. The ATNAA is a multichambered device that consists of four
components: the autoinjector (with atropine and phosphotriesterase, pralidoxime-2 [2 PAM]
chloride piggybacked in separate chambers), a spring-activated needle, a safety cap, and
carrying case. Store the ATNAA in the accessory storage pocket inside your mask carrier.
Protect the ATNAA from freezing. See FM 8-285/NAVMED P-5041/AFJMAN 44-149/ MCRP
4-11.1A for more information on the ATNAA. (Note: The ATNAA will replace the NAAK
based on shelf life expiration dates for the NAAK.)

       c.  Nerve Agent Pretreatment Pyridostigmine. Nerve agent pretreatment
pyridostigmine (NAPP) is an adjunct to the NAAK/ATNAA. NAPP is an investigational
new drug (IND), which requires presidential approval for use by military personnel. NAAK
pretreatment enhances individual survivability in a nerve agent chemical environment.
Each individual is initially issued one NAPP package. If approval for NAPP use is obtained
by the combatant commander, personnel will begin taking their NAPP tablets when
ordered by their commander based on assessment of possible agent exposure within a few
hours or days. One tablet is to be taken on a continuous basis once every 8 hours until all
21 tablets have been taken or the individual has been directed to discontinue taking the
tablets. NAPPs should be stored/refrigerated in temperatures ranging from 35 to 46 degrees
F. If the medication is removed from the refrigerator for a total of 6 months, it should be
assumed that it has lost its potency and should not be used. See FM 8-285/NAVMED P-
5041/AFJMAN 44-149/ MCRP 4-11.1A for more information on the NAPP.

     d.    Convulsant Antidote for Nerve Agents. The convulsant antidote for nerve agents
(CANA) is similar to existing autoinjectors, but it is modified to hold a 2-milliliter volume of
diazepam. The CANA is a disposable device for intramuscular delivery of diazepam to a
buddy who is incapacitated by nerve agent poisoning. It is administered by buddy aid only
and is an adjunct to the NAAK/ATNAA kit. The CANA is an individually issued item. See
FM 8-285/NAVMED P-5041/AFJMAN 44-149/ MCRP 4-11.1A for more information.

      e.   Skin Exposure Reduction Paste Against Chemical Warfare Agents. The
SERPACWA is a topical skin protectant that will protect personnel from penetration or
absorption of vapor particulate and/or liquid CB agents. SERPACWA will be used on bare
skin in conjunction with MOPP ensembles. SERPACWA does not interfere with sunscreens,
skin or clothing, lip balm, hand lotions, or skin camouflage products. When applied at select
locations on the body (e.g., wrist, neck, ankles, armpits, groin area, and waist), SERPACWA
creates an inert physical barrier to CB agents without compromising normal skin function.
Each service member will be issued three SERPACWA packets. An application from one
packet is intended to last approximately 8 hours. SERPACWA will be applied at the
discretion of the commander. (Note: Personnel do not open their IPE to apply SERPACWA
in an NBC environment.)




                                                                                           A-13
8. Related Equipment (Chemical Monitors, Radiation Detection Instruments and
Biological Detectors)

     Commanders must ensure that the appropriate section/squad/department has
personnel trained to operate and maintain the assigned NBC defense equipment. Operation
and maintenance of individual and unit NBC equipment are both a leadership and
individual responsibility. Not everyone in the unit will be provided these items of NBC
equipment, but any individual may become responsible for them or need to use them. The
items may include chemical agent monitors, radiac sets, and other related items.

                                            Appendix B
 GUIDELINES FOR THE NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, AND CHEMICAL
     PORTION OF A COLLECTIVE PROTECTION STANDING
                 OPERATING PROCEDURE


1.     Background

     This appendix provides sample information that could be used to help prepare a CP
system SOP, support shelter entry/exit procedures, prepare a shelter for operation, and
discuss classes of COLPRO and associated equipment.

2. Suggested Guidelines for Preparation of a Collective Protection System
Standing Operating Procedure

     The information in this paragraph is intended as a guide for units. Each unit should
modify and expand this guidance to develop its own SOP. Each SOP should consider
peculiarities of unit organization, mission, equipment, and environmental situation. An
SOP should delineate operational details of a shelter or a van equipped for CP. For
example, details must include NBC-related duties of a guard (where applicable) and entry
and exit procedures.

       The SOP should consider the following:

            •    Responsibilities.

            •    Type and location of the shelter or van.

            •    Resource estimates (e.g., number of shelter management personnel).

            •    Frequency of and requirements for entries and exits.

            •    Maintenance of the area around the shelter.

            •    Personnel entry procedures.

         • Emergency operation procedures, interior procedures, operating procedures for
shelter attendants, and logistics considerations.

            •    Number of nonshelter personnel assigned to the same site as the shelter or
van.

       a.       Outline Objective and Responsibilities.

           (1) Background. The objective of the shelter plan is to provide the best
available physical protection for personnel. Key elements to a successful personnel shelter
plan include adequate shelters, personnel who are familiar with shelter procedures,



                                                                                              B -1
personnel trained in shelter management, the ability to activate and close shelters at the
appropriate times, the ability to stock shelters with required supplies and equipment, and
the ability to occupy shelters for extended periods.

           (2) Fixed-Site Commander. To implement a successful shelter program, the
commander develops a comprehensive protection program to provide sufficient shelter
spaces for military and emergency-essential civilians (include added-forces projections for
teams and supplies). He also determines the type and quantity of shelters based on the
threat and considers the use of open-air CCAs and toxic-free areas (TFAs).

          (3)   Unit Commander. The commander’s responsibilities include—

               • Implementing instructions and publishing unit and facility
implementing instructions and checklists for shelter operations as required.

                • Planning supply and resupply actions. Logistics planning includes
preparing shelter operations for several consecutive days after fallout peaks or after the
onset of CB contamination. Logistics planning also considers medical requirements.

                • Identifying shelter management team (SMT) requirements. Ensure that
SMT members do not have conflicting duties. Identify and train selected unit personnel
identified for mobilization in shelter management techniques.

                 • Training SMTs. Train personnel to operate, maintain, and perform
inspections and minor troubleshooting of the equipment within the shelter. This should
include filtration, air conditioning and heating, electrical, sanitation, and communications
systems. Personnel should also maintain portable detection devices.

                • Conducting operational planning. Stagger work shifts and rest cycles, as
the mission permits to minimize bottlenecks during shelter processing. Leaders should also
develop shelter floor plan diagrams and oversee the operation of the exposure control
system.

          (4) Fixed-Site NBC Personnel. Fixed-site NBC personnel should plan for
expedient hardening to increase the protective capability of the shelter during contingency
operations. Additionally, they should—

               • Direct the performance of preventive and unit level maintenance on
available CP systems.

                •   Provide potable water to sustain operations.

                • Train SMTs in facility and equipment operation, shelter management,
and shelter equipment use.

          (5) Individuals. Each individual should know the location of their protective
shelter and understand the processing procedures in the shelter.




B-2
     b.    Conduct Shelter Planning. For planning purposes, all military and emergency-
essential civilians will occupy the shelter space during appropriate readiness stages.
Planning factors for shelter operations should include—

         • Providing the minimum shelter team size for emergency operations and rest-
and-relief shelters for CB protection and nuclear fallout. There should be one shelter
supervisor and one monitor per shift.

         •     Allowing one space per two persons assigned to a rest-and-relief shelter.

         • Providing positive overpressure of filtered air in collective protection facilities
to keep CB agents out of the TFA.

         •     Providing outward airflow through the air locks and CCA to minimize hazards.

         •     Considering the use and location of open air CCAs and TFAs.

       c.  Ensure Clean Areas Around the Protective Entrance. Provide procedures in an
SOP to decontaminate the area surrounding the shelter or van entrance if liquid agent is
present. Decontamination methods could include turning over or removing a top layer of
soil, removing snow, or adding a clean layer of soil or sand. A clean surface can also be
obtained by laying down a piece of plastic, cardboard, canvas, plywood, or other material.
Use soap or detergent with water to decontaminate areas such as entrance steps.

      d.    Prepare Personnel Entry Procedures. SOPs should address entry procedures to
ensure the least risk of contamination to personnel and equipment inside the shelter and
the least interference with tactical operations.

             (1)   General SOP Guidance. Guidance could include the following:

                • The shelter attendant uses a detector to check all individuals for
contamination. Unless the absence of contamination can be verified, assume that all
individuals are contaminated and ensure that they perform the specific entry procedures.

                 • Chemical detector paper only detects agents in liquid form, most likely
thickened, liquid agents. Unthickened agents absorb into overgarment materials and
cannot be detected by detector paper. However, agent vapor may desorb from clothing
inside shelters or vans and present vapor hazards.

                • One of the attendant’s main NBC duties is assisting personnel who are
entering the shelter. He must help them decontaminate and remove their contaminated
overgarments. The attendant must check himself periodically for contamination, especially
the gloves.

           (2) Detailed SOP Guidance. Describe the steps required for entry into a shelter.
Give sufficient detail to avoid confusion. Standardize the procedures, and try to ensure that
they are consistent with procedures for larger shelters. Specific instructions for entry into
shelters or vans will vary depending on the system. (See applicable TMs/TOs for specific
information from which entry procedures can be developed.) Detailed guidance could
include the following:


                                                                                            B-3
                • Use a chemical agent detector/detector paper or a radiac meter to check
for the presence of contamination on individuals.

                 • Store contaminated items outside the shelter. Use protective covers,
such as plastic or canvas, near the entrance; and ensure that items are not in the path of
the entrance door.

                 •   Decide whether grossly contaminated individuals need to enter the
shelter.

      e.   Prepare Personnel Exit Procedures. SOPs describe the exit procedures for shelter
occupants. Emphasize the importance of contamination reduction measures. Include the
following in the SOP:

       • Occupants leaving the shelter must put on their MOPP gear if an attack is
imminent, occurring, or has occurred.

         • Occupants may need to leave the shelter temporarily or for brief periods during
an attack. They should carefully avoid contaminating their MOPP gear.

        • One person may be assigned outside duties if a shelter or a van has more than
one occupant. That person should be rotated if possible.

                                              WARNING
           When entries are performed in a contaminated environment, conduct monitoring
           inside the shelter every 15 minutes. If the detector changes color or the CAM
           indicates more then one bar, all individuals should mask until the source of
           contamination is located and removed and/or further tests indicate contamination is
           no longer present.




     f.    Prepare Shelter or Van Emergency Operations SOP. Personnel should
familiarize themselves with the procedures to follow if equipment failure occurs and the
alarm sounds. If an alert is given and the shelter or van is prepared for NBC operations,
the alarm system should alert the occupants to any of several types of equipment failure.
Individuals should handle equipment-related emergencies according to the proper
organizational maintenance manual and unit SOP. The following paragraphs illustrate
examples of potential situations that could occur:

           • Sudden loss of positive pressure in the shelter. Lights and horns on a
component module may signal an alarm. Occupants must put on their masks. An assigned
occupant confirms this signal by checking power, lights, and horn. If the alarms are
confirmed and compartment positive pressure is lost, occupants must remain masked while
the assigned operator pursues the problem. The operator uses the organizational
maintenance manual to locate the problem and if possible, repair it. The operator may not
find the problem readily, or perhaps it cannot be repaired. In either case, the occupants
must dress at the appropriate MOPP level.




B-4
            • Malfunctioning of the gas-particulate filter unit. If the change-filter light
comes on, the occupants must put on their masks. An assigned occupant determines if the
filter is operating. He follows procedures in the organizational maintenance manual. If the
filters need to be replaced, occupants must work in the appropriate MOPP gear until the
filters are replaced, the air is purged, and the detectors indicate that masks can be
removed.



                                           WARNING
                            Never change filters during an NBC attack.


          • Interior contamination by entry of contaminated item or personnel. If the
interior becomes contaminated, the occupants must work in appropriate MOPP gear until
the shelter air flow purges the agent from the air and a detector indicates the agent is no
longer present. Wipe off any unabsorbed liquid agent from the equipment. Use a wet rag if
moisture will not harm the equipment.

     g.    Outline Interior Procedures for Occupants. SOPs describe the step-by-step
monitoring procedures. If the detector indicates the presence of contamination, occupants
must mask immediately and check shelter pressure, door, and power. Replace filters
according to the SOP and the appropriate operational maintenance manual.


                                          WARNING
             Ensure that the undressing area is well-ventilated and remove
             contaminated overgarments from the hot-line area to avoid vapor
             buildup.

     h.    Provide SOP Guidance for Shelter Attendants (Guards). Describe operating
procedures for shelter attendants and nonshelter personnel, including visitors. Shelters or
vans may be collocated with another unit. If so, assign nonshelter personnel as shelter
attendants, when possible. Nonshelter personnel are those not essential to the operation of
shelter or van mission-essential equipment. Consider the following for inclusion in the SOP:

           • The shelter attendant monitors for agent presence once an alert has been
issued, but before the attack. After an attack ceases, the attendant periodically monitors
the outside air.

           • Shelter attendants and nonshelter personnel assist in shelter or van
operations. They perform such tasks as refueling generators, realigning antennas, and
assisting in entry and exist of shelter personnel and visitors.

     i.   Determine Contaminated Equipment/Expendable Supplies Requirements.

           (1) Contaminated Equipment and Clothing. SOPs provide guidance for the
disposal of contaminated equipment and clothing. Contaminated equipment and clothing is
kept out of the way of entering personnel. This helps avoid confusion and the spread of
contamination.


                                                                                             B-5
          (2) Expendable Items. The SOP addresses the storage of supplies for certain
expendable items in protective shelters or vans. These are for use by individuals entering
and leaving the shelter or van and could include—

               • Decontamination materials, such as soap or detergent, bleach, M291
skin decontamination kits, and water.

                • Decontamination equipment, including buckets, rags for wiping, and
brushes for scrubbing.

                •   M256-series detector kits.

                •   Disposable field-expedient items.

                •   MOPP gear.

                •   BDUs in various sizes.

                •   Batteries.

              • Plastic bags, trash cans, and other containers to be used for protecting
uncontaminated items.

3.    Entry and Exit Procedures
      Entry and exit procedures are slow and risky procedures; therefore, the commander
must allow only those personnel who are mission-essential to enter and exit. Entry and exit
procedures for ship COLPRO are covered in detail in the CBR defense bill specific to that
ship. Entry and exit procedures for a vehicle, fixed-site, or mobile shelter are specified in
unit SOPs. Step-by-step instructions for all systems allow for safe transition from
individual to COLPRO and back. Entry and exit operations can become high risk, especially
those involving allied forces with different languages, equipment, and training.
      a.   Background.

           (1)   To illustrate procedures, various MOPP gear ensemble combinations can
be used to depict procedures for entry and exit from a shelter, entry and exit from an
armored vehicle, or entry and exit from a contaminated area. The MOPP gear ensemble
may include—

         • Ground personnel IPE: field protective mask with or without hood (based on
the type of overgarment worn), a mask carrier, a helmet with CP cover, an individual
weapon, an armored vest (if worn), and MOPP gear. (See shelter entry/exit instructions for
personnel wearing BDO or JSLIST.)

         • Combat vehicle and aircrew IPE: tank or aircraft mask with or without hood
(based on the type of overgarment worn), a combat vehicle or aircraft crewman helmet, an
individual weapon, an armored vest (if worn), and MOPP gear. (See shelter entry/exit
instructions for individuals in a combat vehicle, an aircraft, or a hatch vehicular system
without an air lock.)



B-6
            (2) Each ensemble and type of enclosure has certain characteristics that dictate
different steps. Therefore, procedures for a particular option are a composite of general
guidelines for individual and COLPRO. Entry and exit procedures in this appendix
illustrate the necessity to modify procedures based on their application and system
configuration. Procedures presented herein give steps common to all entry and exit
procedures. Actual procedures for a particular system should be more specific. The
procedures should be in the system TM, and they should appear in the unit SOP.

     b.    Collective Protective Shelter with an Air Lock.

           (1) Site Selection. Select a site for shelter erection that is free of liquid
contamination. If setting up a shelter where the external agent concentration produces a
relative chemical hazard reading of less than one bar on the CAM (indication that no agent
is present), entry into the shelter is unlimited. Information on setting up, striking, and
operating the shelter is contained in applicable equipment publications.

           (2) Presence of an Agent. Where the external concentration of an agent
produces a CAM reading of one bar or more, entries should be discontinued unless they are
mission-essential. Personnel entering the shelter follow entry instructions when an
external concentration of an agent is detected or suspected or when liquid contamination is
detected or suspected on their overgarments. Other guidance includes—

                 • Establishing a hot line at least 4 feet from the personnel entry air lock
and 14 feet for a litter air lock. Check the floor area between the hot line and the entrance
for evidence of liquid contamination. Use both visual check and detector/monitoring
equipment.

                 • Decontaminating the area if contamination is present. Cover it with a
plastic sheet or similar impermeable material or find another area, if possible.

               • Removing overgarments in a room or a covered area (if possible) that is
separate from the room in which the entrance is located and establishing a hot line at the
doorway between the two rooms. Keep the room with the air lock as clean as possible.

            (3) Equipment. Do not allow equipment to enter the shelter unless it is known
to be free of contamination. Pre-position decontamination kits, alarms, detector kit
samplers, and a CAM inside the air lock. These components require periodic replenishment,
depending on the frequency of entries. The CAM will require fresh batteries based on TM
guidance.

         (4) Procedures Prior to Entry. If contaminated, all personnel must be
decontaminated before they are permitted entry. Use chemical and radiological detection
equipment to check for the presence of contamination on individuals and their equipment.


                                          WARNING
      If the outer door has been opened, always purge the air lock before opening the inner
      door. When operating in a toxic environment, never open the outer and inner doors
      of the air lock at the same time.



                                                                                              B-7
          (5)   Entry Procedures. Personnel—

                • Remove MOPP gear (except masks), BDUs, and boots outside the air
lock. This procedure reduces the amount of possible contamination entering the air lock.

                •   Ensure that the air lock is empty and the inner door is closed.

                •   Enter the air lock and close the outer door.

                 • Check for contamination after the air lock is purged. If contaminated,
the individual must return to the outside and decontaminate his skin. He then returns to
the air lock and repeats the purge cycle and contamination check. If no contamination is
detected, the protective mask is removed and placed in a plastic bag. The plastic bag is
sealed and labeled. The individual opens the inner air lock door and enters the shelter. The
plastic bag is carried into the shelter with the individual.

          (6)   Exit Procedures. Personnel—

                •   Ensure that the ambulatory air lock is empty and the outer door is
closed.

                •   Enter the air lock and close the inner door.

                •   Put on protective masks and exit through the outer door.

                • Put on BDUs and boots and then assume the established MOPP level
before departing the immediate area of the exit door.


                                              WARNING
                Do not open the outer door until the protective mask has been donned.



      c.   Shelter Entry Instructions for Ground Troop Ensemble (BDO). Personnel can
perform entry steps with or without assistance from a buddy or shelter attendant. However,
personnel can perform some steps more easily and safely with help; therefore, the buddy
system is strongly recommended. Personnel in the ground troop ensemble (BDO) may use
the following 13 steps:

           • Step 1. Use detector paper to determine the areas of gross liquid
contamination on equipment and garments. Give special emphasis to these areas, and use
field-expedient absorbents, such as sand, dirt, or rags, to remove the gross liquid
contamination. Take special care to avoid touching these areas during overgarment doffing.
Note: If a radiological or biological hazard is present, lightly wipe down the overgarment
with hot, soapy water before entering the shelter. This will dampen the overgarment and




B-8
reduce any secondary aerosolization of radiological or biological contamination while
conducting doffing procedures.

            • Step 2. Remove the LCE, mask carrier, and helmet before crossing into the
shelter. If the hood is worn over the LCE, loosen the hood straps. Remove the M291
decontamination kit and the waterproof bag and keep them.

           • Step 3. Untie the ankle cords and open the hook-and-pile fasteners and
zippers of both trouser legs.

          • Step 4. Undo the rear snaps of the jacket. Leave the top snap closed and undo
the remaining two front snaps. Untie the waist cords, but leave the zipper closed.

           • Step 5. Undo the shoulder straps. Remove them from beneath the arms and
reattach them over the shoulder. (Use assistance if necessary.) Loosen the neck cord.
Decontaminate the mask hood with the M291 decontamination kit. The M291
decontamination kit is a single-packet, one-step application. Open the packet, slip the
fingers into the pad strap, and decontaminate the mask and hood thoroughly. The M291
decontamination kit can also be used to decontaminate equipment that needs to be taken
into the shelter.

           • Step 6. Decontaminate the gloves before rolling the hood. (Use assistance if
necessary.) Leave the hood zipper closed. Grasp the hood by the straps and lift the hood off
the shoulders and partially off the head until most of the back of the head is exposed. Roll
the hood. Start at the chin, making sure that the zipper and neck cord are tucked into the
roll, and work around the entire mask until the rolled hood will stay up, off the shoulders.
Roll the hood tightly against the mask without pulling the hood off the back of the head.
Note: If your assistant is also entering the shelter, he also performs steps 1 through 6
before proceeding to step 7.
            • Step 7. Undo the top jacket snap and open the jacket zipper. With one hand,
pull the sleeve band over the hand without loosening the glove (make a fist if necessary).
Remove that arm from the sleeve. Repeat the procedure for the other arm. Place the jacket
away from the entry path.

            • Step 8. Stand against a wall or other support for balance, and unsnap and
unzip the trousers. (Use assistance if necessary.) Pull or have the assistant pull the
trousers over the heels of the chemical overboots/GVOs for removal, or walk the trousers off
by alternately lifting one foot while holding the trouser material to the ground with the
other foot. Leave the overboots or GVOs on, and place the trousers away from the entry
path.
Note: If your assistant, if also entering the shelter, he also performs steps 7 and 8 now
before proceeding to step 9.
            • Step 9. For a van with an air lock, go up the steps and loosen the overboot
laces or GVO clasps. Open the door, remove one overboot or GVO at a time, toss it away
from the steps, and step into the air lock with the exposed field boot. Do not touch exposed
field boots on the exterior platform surface or stairs after removing the overboots or GVOs.



                                                                                            B-9
Note: When operating an air lock system in a contaminated environment, the protective
entrance (PE) and the shelter interior must be monitored with detection equipment.
           • Step 10. Enter the air lock and ensure that the door is closed. When the low-
pressure indicator light in the PE module goes out, rotate the purge time clockwise to its
full extent. Do not set the purge time until after the low-pressure light goes out.

           • Step 11. Decontaminate the gloves again, and then decontaminate the bottom
(rolled portion) of the hood. Wait for completion of the purge cycle. When the timer bell
sounds, loosen the gloves but do not remove them.

           • Step 12. Clear the air lock. A trained operator will use the CAM, if available,
to detect and indicate the relative level of chemical agent vapor hazard present on
personnel, clothing, or equipment as well as the interior of the PE or shelter. When
sampling results are negative, stop breathing (hold your breath), remove the mask and
hood, and place them in the waterproof bag. Remove the gloves and drop them to the floor.
Keep the waterproof bag.


                                                WARNING
        A suspected false-positive reading must be verified with other monitoring equipment, such
        as M8/M9 detector paper and the M256 detector kit before proceeding further.

        • Step 13. Enter the shelter. Continue to hold your breath, enter the shelter, and
then resume breathing.


                                               WARNING
        When entries are performed in a contaminated environment, monitor them every 30
        minutes. If detector/monitoring shows positive, all personnel should mask until the source
        of the contamination is located and removed and/or further tests indicate the
        contamination is no longer a threat.



     d.   Shelter Entry Instructions for Ground Troop Ensemble (JSLIST). Personnel in
the ground troop ensemble (JSLIST) may use the following 13 steps for doffing IPE.

           • Step 1. Use detector paper to determine the areas of gross liquid
contamination on equipment and garments. Give special emphasis to these areas and use
field-expedient absorbents, such as sand, dirt, or rags, to remove the gross liquid
contamination. Take special care to avoid touching these areas during overgarment doffing.
Note: If a radiological or biological hazard is present, lightly wipe down the overgarment
with hot, soapy water before entering the shelter. This will dampen the overgarment and
reduce any secondary aerosolization of radiological or biological contamination while
conducting doffing.
           • Step 2. Remove the LCE, mask carrier, and helmet before crossing into the
shelter. Remove the DKIE and the waterproof bag, and keep them.
Note: If the JSLIST is worn, the mask will not have a hood attached.


B-10
           • Step 3. Unfasten the hook-and-pile fasteners at the wrist and ankles. Untie
the bow in the coat and retention cord (if tied), unfasten the webbing strip snap, and allow
the waist coat retention cord loop to retract. Touching only the outside surfaces of the coat,
loosen the bottom of the coat by pulling the material at the bottom of the coat away from
the body. Locate the trouser suspender snap couplers by feeling the outside of the coat.
After locating the snap couplers, squeeze them to release the suspenders.
Note: Avoid touching the throat area. If the JSLIST is worn, pull the overgarment hood
over the protective mask and secure it.
           • Step 4. (Use an assistant if possible.) Decontaminate the mask using the
M291 decontamination kit. Take special care to decontaminate the eyelens, face blank,
barrel locks, and the front edge of the hood. The individual or assistant, if used, will
decontaminate his gloves. Unfasten the barrel locks and loosen the drawstrings.
Note: Use the M291 to decontaminate any equipment taken into the shelter.
           • Step 5. Unfasten the front closure hook-and-pile tape at the chin down to the
chest, and then pull the slide fastener down to the chest area.

            • Step 6. (Use an assistant if possible.) Grasp the hood by the outside surface
near each barrel lock, lift the hood up off the head, and reverse-roll the hood one time while
pulling it toward the back of the head to remove. If assistance is available, use the
procedures outlined in FM 3-5, NBC Decontamination (MOPP gear exchange) to remove the
hood.
Note: If the assistant is entering the shelter, he perform steps 1 through 6 before
proceeding to step 7.
           • Step 7. Unfasten the front closure hook-and-pile tape and slide the fastener
from the chest down to the bottom of the coat. Grasp the front of the coat and pull the coat
back until it is off the shoulders. Extend the arms behind the back and work them out of
the sleeves. Move the coat away from the entry path.

            • Step 8. Unfasten the hook-and-pile fastener tapes on the waistband of the
trousers. Unfasten the two front closure snaps, and open the fly slide fastener. Grasp the
trousers at the hips and pull them down to the knees (use assistant if possible). Pull or have
the assistant pull the trousers over the heels of the boots for removal, or walk the trousers
off by alternately lifting one foot while holding the trouser material to the ground with the
other foot. Leave boots on and move the trousers away from the entry path.
Note: If the assistant is entering the shelter, he performs steps 7 and 8 before proceeding to
step 9.
           • Step 9. A ground-based shelter with an air lock entry is not applicable to the
Patriot Missile System. For a van with an air lock, go up the steps and unfasten the two
strap buckles on the MULOs or unfasten the clasps on the BVOs/GVOs. Open the door,
remove one MULO or overboot at a time, toss it away from the steps, and step into the air
lock with the exposed combat boot (without the MULO). Do not touch the exposed combat
boots on the exterior platform surface or stairs after removing the MULOs or BVOs/GVOs.
Note: When operating an air lock system in a contaminated environment, the PE and the
shelter interior must be monitored with detection equipment.




                                                                                           B-11
           • Step 10. Enter the air lock, and ensure that the door is closed. When the low-
pressure light in the PE module goes out, rotate the purge time clockwise to its full extent.
Do not set the purge time until after the low-pressure light goes out.

          • Step 11. Decontaminate the gloves again and wait for completion of the purge
cycle. When the timer bell sounds, loosen the gloves but do not remove them.

           • Step 12. A trained operator will use the CAM, if available, to detect and
indicate the relative level of agent vapor hazard present on personnel, clothing, or
equipment as well as the interior of the PE/shelter. When sampling results are negative,
stop breathing (hold your breath), remove the mask, and place it in the waterproof bag.
Remove the gloves and drop them to the floor. Keep the waterproof bag.

               •    Step 13. Enter the shelter, and resume breathing.


                                                  WARNING
               A suspected false-positive reading must be verified with other monitoring
               equipment, such as M8 and/or M9 detector paper and the M256 detector kit before
               proceeding further.


                                                   WARNING
               When entries are performed in a contaminated environment, monitor them every 30
               minutes. If detector/monitoring shows positive, all personnel should mask until the
               source of the contamination is located and removed and/or further tests indicate the
               contamination is no longer a threat.



      e.   Shelter Exit Instructions for Ground Troop Ensemble. Overgarment donning
procedures for exiting the shelter are less time-consuming and risky than doffing
procedures. Whenever possible, ensure that replacement or spare overgarments are pre-
positioned inside the shelter. For systems with a high rate of entry and exit, commanders
must provide periodic resupply of spare overgarments. Personnel should follow these four
steps:

           •       Step 1: Put on clean overgarments, overboots or GVOs, and gloves inside the
shelter.

         • Step 2: Check the compartment control module (CCM)/system control module
(SCM) to ensure that the air lock is unoccupied. Stop breathing and step into the entrance,
bringing the waterproof bag.

Note: The “occupied” (or purge) indicator being off on the CCM or the SCM does not
positively indicate the lack of someone in the entrance.

         • Step 3: Open the waterproof bag, remove the mask by the straps with one
hand, and make sure that the hood is inside out over the front of the mask. Place the mask
to the chin and face, and pull the head harness over the head. Tighten the cheek straps,



B-12
clear and seal the mask, and resume breathing. Unroll the hood, pull it over the head, and
tighten the neck cord.

            •   Step 4: Exit the air lock, and ensure that the PE door is fully closed after
exiting.

      f.    Shelter Entry Instructions for Combat Vehicle or Aircrew Ensemble. Use of the
combat vehicle crewman mask or the aircraft crewman helmet with a different mask
configuration requires differences in removing and handling the hood. The microphone cord
hangs down to the shoulders. It can transfer contamination if not secured to the helmet.
The microphone boom must be tucked in well against the helmet; otherwise, it snags the
hood. In addition, the main power cord extends beyond the hood. If contaminated, it will be
very difficult to decontaminate. To avoid these problems, personnel should use the following
four steps:

         • Step 1. If the vehicle helmet is worn underneath the hood, remove the hood
(from back to front) from the helmet, remove it from around the eye lenses, and then
remove it from the filter hose. If the hood is worn underneath the helmet, remove the
helmet first, and then remove the hood from the mask in the manner described.



                                                 WARNING
           Do not touch the eyelens area or the canister hose. These are difficult to decontaminate
           and are potential transfer hazards.



         • Step 2. With the mask and helmet (if applicable) still on, remove the
overgarment jacket and trousers. Use the same basic procedures outlined for personnel in
the ground troop ensemble, with one exception. When performing the doffing procedure,
bend at the waist to prevent the filter canister and hose from touching the body when the
overgarment is being removed.

         • Step 3. Proceed to the air lock or the hot line. Remove the boots when stepping
into the air lock.

        • Step 4. Just before entering the protective enclosure, remove the mask, helmet,
and gloves. Seal the mask inside the waterproof bag, and enter the enclosure.
Note: For systems without an air lock, remove the mask, helmet, and gloves only after tests
indicate the absence of vapor. Place the mask inside the waterproof bag, and seal the bag.
     g.    Shelter Exit Instructions for Combat Vehicle or Aircrew Ensemble.
Overgarment donning procedures for exiting the shelter are less time-consuming and risky
than doffing procedures. Whenever possible, ensure that replacement or spare
overgarments are pre-positioned inside the shelter. For systems with a high rate of entry
and exit, commanders must provide periodic resupply of spare overgarments. Personnel
should follow these three steps:




                                                                                                      B-13
           •       Step 1. Put on clean overgarments, overboots or GVOs, and gloves inside the
shelter.

         • Step 2. Check to ensure that the air lock is unoccupied. Stop breathing, and
step into the entrance, bringing the waterproof bag.

           •       Step 3. Open the waterproof bag, don the mask, and put on gloves.
Note: For systems without air lock, all personnel don MOPP gear before anyone exits the
protective enclosure. After the exit, those remaining reseal and purge the enclosure. When
vapor contamination drops below detection levels, the remaining personnel can follow
unmasking procedures.
      h.   Shelter Hatch Vehicular System Without an Air Lock. They are for entering and
exiting a combat fighting vehicle in an NBC environment. They can be modified for shelters
without an air lock. Before exiting for mission-essential tasks, personnel should don their
SCALP or expedient protective clothing if available, such as wet-weather gear over their
MOPP gear. When they complete the tasks, they should remove any expedient protective
clothing in a top-to-bottom sequence. They must avoid touching clean overgarments with
the cover exterior. If heavy liquid contamination is present and/or additional overgarments
are available, personnel must perform two doffing procedures—one for the cover and one for
the overgarment. Entry and exit procedures detailed herein assume the following
conditions:

               •    The vehicle exterior is contaminated.

               •    The crew is operating buttoned-up with the NBC overpressure system on.

               •    The crew is wearing all of their protective clothing (except mask and gloves).

               •    The exit is for a mission-essential task, such as corrective maintenance.

               •    The overpressure system remains on throughout the exit and entry cycle.

           • The tactical situation is relatively safe, such as during rearming and/or
refueling operations.

               •    The vehicle is not under fire.

               •    Contact with the enemy is unlikely.

               •    Immediate movement is not anticipated.

           (1) Entry Instructions. The loader on an armored fighting vehicle performs
steps 1 through 8. When the loader completes step 8, other personnel perform step 1 and
then steps 4 through 8. The last individual in must close the hatch. With the hatch closed,
the crew performs steps 9 through 12.

                      •   Step 1. Mount the vehicle over the left, front road wheel.




B-14
                  • Step 2. Decontaminate the hatch and the area around the hatch
(approximately 4 feet in diameter) using the M11 or M13 DAP. Get the water can from the
left bustle rack.

               • Step 3. Flush the decontaminant from the loader’s hatch and
surrounding area after the required stand time.

                • Step 4. Stand next to the loader’s hatch, and remove any field-expedient
protective items or wet-weather gear. Take care not to touch the exterior of any field-
expedient protective clothing items, wet-weather gear, or gloves. Discard the removed items
over the side.

                 • Step 5. Loosen the rain trousers, if worn. Roll them with the clean side
out, while pulling them down to the ankles. Do not allow the contaminated side of field-
expedient protective clothing items, rain gear, or contaminated gloves to touch the
overgarment. Discard the rain trousers over the side.

                 • Step 6. Lift one foot, and remove the boot cover. Discard it over the side
of the vehicle, and place that foot, with exposed boot, inside the decontaminated area.
Repeat this procedure for the other foot.

                •   Step 7. Decontaminate gloves with the personal decontamination kit.

                •   Step 8. Lower yourself into the vehicle.

                •   Step 9. Resume operations as if in a contaminated environment.

                • Step 10. Monitor the interior after a purge cycle and as the tactical
situation permits. A crew member should begin sampling with detector/monitoring
equipment.

                 • Step 11. Proceed with unmasking procedures if detector results are
negative. If no symptoms appear, remove masks and gloves at the vehicle commander’s
order. Operate in the normal overpressure, buttoned-up mode.

               • Step 12. Remain in MOPP gear if the detector results continue to be
positive. Remain protected until the mission is complete and further decontamination can
be performed or until further tests are negative.

          (2)   Exit Instructions. Perform the following steps to safely exit the vehicle:

                •   Step 1. Traverse the turret until the main gun is centered over the front
slope.

                •   Step 2. Put on the mask and protective gloves.

               • Step 3. The loader exits before any other crew member exits. Put on the
SCALP, a field-expedient protective clothing item, or rain gear and boot covers. Carry the
personal decontamination kit, and exit through the loader’s hatch.



                                                                                             B-15
               • Step 4. Remaining personnel move to the loader’s station. Put on the
SCALP, a field-expedient protective clothing item, or rain gear and boot covers. Carry the
personal decontamination kit, and exit through the loader’s hatch. The last person to exit
must carry the decontamination apparatus and close the hatch.

                •   Step 5. The loader determines if the vehicle and surrounding area are
contaminated.
Note: Follow the procedures for detecting the presence of chemical agents. For immediate
detection, the loader uses M8/M9 paper for suspected liquid agents. The vehicle
commander can use detector/monitoring equipment to detect any vapor agents. If the need
to exit the vehicle is urgent, skip this time-consuming step and assume that the area is
contaminated.
                • Step 6. The crew may reduce its MOPP level and perform step 7 if no
contamination is present. If detector/monitoring equipment indicates contamination is
present, decontaminate the loader’s hatch and an area approximately 4 feet in diameter
around it.

                •   Step 7. Perform the task(s) that dictated the exit.

                 i. Open-Air, Toxic-Free Area. Personnel who transition from a
contaminated area to an open-air TFA follow a deliberate process to ensure that there is no
transfer of contamination. Table B-1 outlines the procedures for processing personnel into
an open air TFA.

4.     Wartime Shelter Preparation and Operation

      a.   Shelter Organization and Operation. The commander exercises normal C2 over
forces in shelters to ensure that personnel are available to continue the wartime mission. A
shelter command structure should reflect the typical unit command structure. The same
personnel who perform these functions during peacetime should continue their duties
during wartime shelter operations. The shelter preparation and organization involves
designating SMTs; preparing for collection and warning; understanding preattack, during-
attack, and postattack recovery actions; understanding CCA operations; and making
provisions for IPE disposition. For example—

             •   The owning organization commander is the commander for all organizational
shelters.

            • The owning organization first sergeant is the administrative first sergeant
for all organizational shelters.




B-28
     b.   Shelter Management Teams. SMTs are preidentified by the unit commander for
each shelter and perform the following functions:

           •   Operate the shelter.

           •   Select personnel to perform shelter operational tasks.

           •   Control entry, exit, and internal shelter occupant location.

           •   Monitor for NBC contamination.

            • Brief personnel exiting the shelter into a contaminated environment on the
effects of contamination and the exposure limits.

           •   Perform immediate decontamination.

           •   Establish a CCA and TFA for each shelter, if appropriate.

          • Establish radiological exposure control procedures for each shelter if the
threat warrants.

           •   Detect and measure gamma radiation and CW agents.

           •   Determine if contamination is present inside and immediately outside the
shelter.

     c.    Preattack Actions. Units and SMTs should—

           •   Recall shelter teams and activate shelters.

           •   Improve shelter survivability inside and out.

           • Recall personnel not performing mission-critical tasks to their assigned
shelter at the proper readiness stage.

     d.    During-Attack Actions. SMTs should—

           •   Suspend shelter in and out processing and secure the doors.

           •   Instruct personnel to take whatever cover is available.

           •   Instruct personnel to don IPE items if required.

           •   Monitor overpressure and filtration systems for damage when applicable.

           •   Monitor for contamination.

     e.    Postattack Actions. SMTs should—




                                                                                         B-29
         • Check for damage, unexploded ordnance (UXO), casualties, and
contamination.

             •   Implement radiological exposure control procedures for a nuclear/radiological
hazard.

           • Initiate decontamination procedures for people, supplies, and equipment
entering the shelter.

          • Implement contamination control/avoidance procedures for all personnel
performing outside, mission-essential tasks.

             •   Wear IPE as directed by the commander.

    f.    Shelter Equipment. Each shelter should have a shelter kit. Contents may vary;
however, each kit should have—

            • A first aid kit that is sufficient for the expected number of personnel and
their likely medical needs.

           • A floor plan identifying the preplanned areas and the emergency, utility
shutoff locations.

         • A base grid map with medical facilities, shelters, control centers, and key
phone numbers indicated.

             •   SMT identification devices (e.g., badges or armbands).

           • Operational manuals for the shelter system, support equipment, and
specialized equipment.

             •   Shelter directives and operational checklists to cover all shelter operation
aspects.

      g.  CCA Operations. CCAs can be part of a shelter or they can be in the open air.
CCAs are essential to sustained operations in an NBC environment. They limit the spread
of contamination into a TFA so that personnel can work or obtain rest and relief without
wearing IPE. They also provide a controlled environment in which to safely remove
contaminated IPE. CCA operations include—

             •   Developing procedures and checklists for assistants and signs for processing
personnel.

             •   Obtaining supplies and equipment for stocking and resupply.

         • Covering shelter and CCA supplies and equipment that are susceptible to
contamination under covers.

          • Processing personnel and material through a CCA before entering a
designated TFA.


B-30
         • Decontaminating IPE (except the overgarment) as soon as practical after
contamination occurs.

           •   Considering all exposed IPE as contaminated when liquid contamination is
present.

          • Bagging and removing liquid-contaminated IPE and waste from the CCA as
soon as possible to reduce vapor levels, and bagging and removing trash from shelters.

     h.    IPE Disposition. Process contaminated IPE according to the overgarment TO/TM
instructions. CCA personnel should—

           •   Prepare serviceable protective masks for reuse.

           •   Discard contaminated, permeable IPE.

           •   Retain other equipment not addressed above for reuse.

      i.   Checklist Requirements. In most cases, checklists should be specific enough to
allow an untrained person to accomplish all needed actions. Checklists may address the
following areas—

           •   Casualty Care. Establish a first aid and buddy care capability for the shelter.

          • Security. Secure all entry and exit points when the shelter is operational. Use
only one point for entrance and exit.

           •   Fire Control. Inspect the shelter during each shift to identify potential fire
sources.

           • Supply. Coordinate consumable resupply with the control center responsible
for the consumables.

           •   Subsistence. Provide subsistence.

           • Administrative. Keep an events log of the shelter from activation until
deactivation.

         • Mortuary. (see Joint Pub 4-06, Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for
Mortuary Affairs in Joint Operations).

           •   Sleeping. Plan for and operate a sleeping area for the shelter.

5.   Classes of Site Collective Protection and Associated Protective Equipment

     a.     Classes of Fixed-Site Collective Protection. For fixed-site COLPRO facilities,
classes of protection are defined according to the degree of protection provided.

          (1) Class I, Pressurized Shelters. Class I structures are pressurized, fully
integrated shelters that provide active protection. These systems have high-efficiency air


                                                                                             B-31
filtration and positive-pressure (overpressure) systems. Dampers control ventilation
openings automatically. These facilities require a CCA and a purging air lock to
accommodate mission-required entries and exits. The protection afforded by a pressurized
shelter depends on the filter capacity to remove agents. Class I facilities are divided into
four subclasses:

         • Class I-A, Fully Integrated. Class I-A structures include buildings constructed
tightly enough to integrate COLPRO with maximum efficiency. The CCA can be internal to
the building or it can be located outside.

          • Class I-B, Partially Integrated. Class I-B structures require permanent
modifications, such as ductwork and sealing, to all or part of a facility to provide COLPRO
for its occupants. Heating and cooling must be upgraded. The CCA may be permanently
installed inside or located outside.

         • Class I-C, Expedient. Class I-C structures require that selected portions of the
building be sealed by temporary measures, such as plastic sheeting and tape. In turn,
transportable filter units are temporarily mounted to the building to provide COLPRO.
Heating/cooling may or may not be employed, and a temporary CCA would need to be
established.

         • Class I-D, Secondary Enclosure. Class 1-D enclosures can be used for
temporary protection. The buildings are not suitable for sealing, but they are suitable for
the use of portable internal enclosures or liner systems, such as the M28 or M20A1 CPE.
Such application allows for the use of existing facilities and auxillary heating and cooling
systems.

           (2) Class II, Intermediate Shelters. This class of shelters provides continuous
protection in buildings that have forced ventilation. It protects against CB and/or
radiological agents entering through outside air intakes. Air filtration equipment is applied
to the outside air intakes and the normal rates of introduction of outside air with little or no
overpressure are maintained.

           (3) Class III, Passive Shelters. This class of shelters are unventilated and may
be used for an incident such as a transient release of a TIC. Limited protection is achieved
by closing the building and turning off the HVAC before the cloud arrives.

     b.  Protective Entrances. PEs provide an interface between the contaminated
environment and the protected enclosure. PEs include the following types—

           (1) Protective Entrance Without an Air Lock. In a contaminated environment,
overpressure systems not having a PE (air lock) must prevent contamination from entering
the enclosure. Drills and procedures must be established for this purpose. A system without
an air lock consists of a clean interior shelter area only. During a liquid or vapor chemical
attack, the system must remain closed and personnel must not enter or exit. Opening the
doors allows contamination inside, and personnel must assume a higher MOPP level until
the interior is purged or decontaminated.




B-32
            (2) Protective Entrance With an Air Lock. An air lock prevents contamination
from entering the enclosure. The air lock is pressurized, and contamination is eliminated
through the use of filtered air. Air pressure in the entrance is slightly less than that in the
protective enclosure but slightly more than outside pressure. An air lock is a transition
enclosure—a protected entryway in which personnel wait for a period of 3 to 5 minutes
before entering or exiting the TFA. The main function of the air lock is to prevent direct
vapor transport into the TFA. During the air lock-purging period, the flow of filtered air
through the air lock flushes out airborne contaminants introduced with the opening of the
outer door. The air lock also ensures that TFA overpressure is not compromised during the
entry or exit. Air passing through the air lock purges contaminants that might enter during
entry or exit of personnel or equipment. This air comes from the protective enclosure, the
filter unit, or both. Different PE configurations create variations of the overpressure
category. The variations are those with a single air lock and those with a two-stage air lock.

                 (a) Protective Entrance With Single Air Lock. Many shelters modified for
COLPRO use a single-compartment protective entrance. An example is the M12 protective
entrance (Figure B-1). Using a dedicated filter unit for the air lock helps maintain TFA
integrity. Before entering the air lock from a contaminated area, personnel must remove
their MOPP gear except gloves and masks. Minor exposure to a chemical agent vapor is
possible between the overgarment removal and the entrance into the air lock. Clothing
tends to absorb any chemical agent vapor in the atmosphere during this brief exposure. The
amount of agent absorbed depends on the agent concentration in the atmosphere, the
length of exposure, the type of agent, the type of clothing exposed, and the climatic
conditions. The air purge in the air lock flushes out the contaminated air. It also reduces
the amount of absorbed agent on clothing before the individual enters the protective
shelter. After an individual and/or piece of equipment enters the protective shelter,
monitoring ensures that hazardous levels of the agent are not carried inside.




                            Figure B-1. M12 Protective Entrance

                 (b) Protective Entrance with Two-Stage Air Lock. Adding a CCA to a
single air lock system creates a two-stage air lock (Figure B-2 [page B-34]). Entering




                                                                                          B-33
personnel remove MOPP gear in the CCA. This system affords better control of liquid and
vapor hazards during entry and exit.

                                 Single Air-Lock System

                                 Two Stage Air-Lock System


                             Figure B-2. Collective-Protection
                                 Entrance Configurations

            (3) Integral Protective Entrances. Integral PEs are those that are included in
the manufacturing process for the shelter. Integral PEs are designed to offer improved
accessibility, more convenient storage and transport, and reduced setup time. For example,
the contamination avoidance protective entrance (CAPE) is on every Standardized
Integrated Command Post System (SICPS) shelter fielded. The CAPE helps to minimize
liquid and vapor contamination during limited entry/exit. Occupants must be masked and
the shelter purged following use. There are two types of integral PEs—internal and
external. Integral PEs are smaller than the detachable PEs and require less airflow during
the purge cycle.

         • Internal Integral PE. Deployed internally, the integral PE can remain in its
functional configuration and need not be stowed for transport. Since it is contained within
the shelter, it is much less vulnerable on the battlefield.

          • External Integral PE. The external integral PE is used for shelters that cannot
sacrifice the internal space. The external integral PE must be stowed for transport.

     c.   Establishment of Protective Shelters. There is equipment in the US DOD
inventory that can be used to establish protective shelters. Examples include the fan filter
assembly (FFA) 580; the USAF A/E32C or Army C-100 air conditioner; the field depolyable
environmental control unit (FDECU) with CB hardening kit and M28 CPE blower, a filter,
and air ducts; the chemically/biologically hardened air management plant (CHAMP); and
the M96 modular collective protective equipment (MCPE) filter unit.

           (1) Fan Filter Assembly 580. The FFA 580-filter unit for is a 600 CFM filter.
The FFA 580 employs the modular CPE filter set, which is the most widely used filter set
among the USA, USN, and USAF. This unit provides an option for integrating filtration
with air conditioning, and it has the lowest hardware and operating costs among
transportable filter units employing standard military filters. Where the building would



B-34
require more than the capacity of the FFA 580 unit, the M49 filter unit or a large-capacity,
commercial filter unit built to military specifications should be considered.

          (2) Modification of Environmental Control Units. Short of major modifications
to the HVAC systems, users could modify an existing environmental control unit by adding
a GPFU.




                                                                                        B-35

    HUMAN FACTOR EFFECTS OF MISSION-ORIENTED PROTECTIVE
                         POSTURE



1.       Background

     This appendix provides information on the physiological and psychological stress
incurred while wearing the BDU, BDO, or JSLIST. Once an accurate assessment of the
NBC threat has been made, the key to selecting an appropriate MOPP level lies in
understanding the physiological and psychological stresses placed upon the wearer.
Multiple physiological and psychological factors can impact unit personnel, but there are
countermeasures that can be taken to mitigate the effects.

2.       Physiological Factors

      a.   Heat Stress. Body temperature must be maintained within narrow limits for
optimum physical and mental performance. The body produces more heat during work than
at rest. Normally, the body cools itself by the evaporation of sweat and the radiation of heat
at the skin surface. MOPP gear restricts these heat loss mechanisms because of its high
insulation and low permeability to water vapor. In addition, physical work tasks require
more effort when personnel wear protective clothing because of its added weight and
restricted movement. Work intensity is also a major contributing factor to heat stress that
can be managed by leaders. Military work can be categorized as light, moderate, or heavy.
Table C-1 provides examples of work activities that can be used as guides in estimating the
work intensity for a particular mission or task.

    Representative tasks listed in this table were obtained from FM 21-10/MCRP 4-11.10, Field Hygiene and Sanitation.




                                                                                                                 C-1
           (1) Military personnel wearing CP clothing often experience heat stress. To
prevent such heat stress from resulting in heat stress-related injuries, they follow a
prescribed cycle of work and rest periods. The work/rest cycles are based on the
environment (temperature, humidity, and solar load), the workload of the individual, and
the clothing ensemble being worn. These work/rest cycles are usually described in terms of
minutes of work allowed per hour. The remainder of the hour (after completing the allowed
work) is used for rest to allow heat to dissipate and to allow the individual to cool down.

           (2) Under most conditions, when individuals are wearing heavier garments,
the amount of work allowed per hour is less than the amount of work allowed when wearing
a lighter garment. However, under some conditions, the work allowed per hour is actually
greater when wearing a heavier garment than when wearing a lighter garment.

            (3) When an individual is wearing CP clothing, the primary modes of heat
exchange between the individual and the surroundings are by conduction, evaporation (of
sweat), and solar radiation (if the sun is out). The nature of CP clothing is such that
convective heat transfer (due to the movement of the air) is minimized by the garments and
is not a significant factor. Evaporation will always result in a cooling effect for the
individual if the water vapor can escape from the clothing ensemble. The amount of
evaporative cooling depends on the humidity of the ambient air and upon the rate at which
the water vapor can escape.

           (4) Solar radiation (if present) will always result in adding heat to the
individual. As the sun beats down on the surface of the clothing, the garments will heat up.
Eventually, the heat will be transferred through the clothing layers to the individual. This
heat from the solar radiation will increase the heat stress situation.

           (5) Heat transfer by conduction depends on the skin temperature of the
individual and the ambient air temperature. When the skin temperature is greater than
the ambient temperature, the heat will transfer from the skin to the surrounding air. When
the ambient air temperature is greater than the skin temperature, the heat will transfer
from the surroundings to the skin, heating up the individual.

           (6) In most situations, the total heat lost (by evaporation and conduction [if the
skin is warmer than the ambient air]) is greater than the heat gained (by solar radiation, if
present, and by conduction, if the air is warmer than the skin). Insulation, of course,
reduces the rate at which this heat transfer occurs, but it cannot prevent it entirely. The
greater the insulation, the lower the rate of heat transfer and the greater the heat stress
induced upon the individual. This is the normal, expected situation in which the heavier
garment (i.e., BDO) induces more heat stress than the lighter garment (i.e., JSLIST).

           (7) In some cases, especially under conditions of high ambient temperature or a
solar load, the heat gained from the environment is greater than the heat loss. Insulation
reduces the rate at which this heat transfer occurs. In this case, the heavier garment
protects the individual from the high external heat load better than the lighter garment.
Hence, an individual can actually work longer in the heavier garment (i.e., BDO) than in
the lighter garment (i.e., JSLIST) under such conditions. This is why desert nomads wear
wool to protect themselves from the high external heat load caused by solar radiation and
high ambient air temperatures.


C-2
     b.    Dehydration.

            (1) Impact. Because of higher body temperatures, individuals in MOPP gear
sweat considerably more than usual, often more than 1.5 quarts of water every hour during
work. Water must be consumed to replace lost fluids, or dehydration will follow. Even a
slight degree of dehydration impairs the body’s ability to regulate its temperature and
nullifies the benefits of heat acclimatization and physical fitness. It increases the
susceptibility to heat injury and reduces work capacity, appetite, and alertness. Even in
individuals who are not heat casualties, the combined effects of dehydration, restricted heat
loss from the body, and increased work effort place a severe strain on the body’s functions.
Individuals, therefore, suffer from decrements in mental and physical performance. The
difficulty of drinking in MOPP increases the likelihood of dehydration. Thirst is not an
adequate indicator of dehydration, and individuals will not sense when they are
dehydrated. Individuals will habitually fail to replace body water losses, even when
drinking water is readily available.

           (2) Mitigation Measures. Individuals should drink as much water as possible
before donning the mask. Frequent drinking while working is more effective in
maintaining hydration than waiting until rest periods to drink. The unit chain of command
must take responsibility for enforcing regular and timely fluid replacement in their
personnel.

     c.    Inadequate Nutrition.

           (1) Impact. In addition to bodily requirements for electrolyte (salt) replacement
caused by sustained and excessive sweating, the higher work intensities typical of
operations in MOPP lead to an increased demand for calories. The lack of adequate energy
supplies can lead to decrements in physical and mental performance.

           (2) Mitigation Measures. The method selected to minimize feeding-related
problems depends on the availability of safe, uncontaminated areas, and operational
constraints. In a contaminated area where there is also a vapor hazard, personnel can be
moved into a contamination-free facility or CPS. Since CPSs have limited capacity, small
groups can be rotated through these facilities. In a contaminated area with no COLPRO
available, relocate personnel to a safe area for feeding by rotating small portions of the unit
or by replacing the entire unit. If personnel are in a contaminated area with no detectable
vapor hazard or in a clean area where they are under a constant threat of NBC attack, use
a rotating method to feed about 25 percent at any one time. Take care to prevent
contaminating the food.




                                                                                            C-3
      d.   Miosis.

           (1) Impact. Although MOPP gear may be the most common source of
performance problems during NBC operations, some chemical agents, (primarily the nerve
agents) can produce performance decrements at exposure levels below that which would
cause casualties. The tissues of the eye react to levels of nerve agent vapor that will not
affect other bodily systems. Minute amounts of nerve agent in direct contact with the eyes,
can affect the eyes, causing constriction of the pupil (miosis). Miosis can be expected to
negate or reduce the efficiency of task performance at night, tasks which depend on unaided
night vision. Some examples are aircraft crews, operation of surveillance devices, etc.
Identification of miosis-sensitive critical tasks and protection of critical specialist personnel
should be considered in unit SOPs for operations in a chemical environment.

           (2) Mitigation Measures. The following precautions can be adopted to minimize
the incidence of miosis:

               • Performing miosis-sensitive tasks before there is a risk of encountering
miosis-producing hazards.

                • Masking when in proximity to ground, equipment, or personnel known
to have been recently contaminated with liquid nerve agent.

                 • Decontaminating and/or changing protective clothing as soon as possible
for units or individuals known to have been contaminated by liquid nerve agent.

                • Allowing contaminated personnel to remain masked as long as possible.
If short unmasking periods are permitted, personnel should be widely dispersed in the open
air, and those known to have been contaminated should be segregated.

                • Avoiding bare-hands contact with contaminated surfaces. Protective
gloves should be worn when there is suspicion of contamination and replaced when they
become contaminated. Do not rub eyes.

3.    Psychological Factors

      a.    Psychological Impact. NBC warfare threat adds to an already stressful situation,
because it creates unique fears in personnel and isolates them from their environment.
MOPP4 reduces the ability to see and hear clearly and makes it more difficult to recognize
and communicate with others. This creates or increases feelings of isolation and confusion.
The awkwardness of wearing bulky, impermeable garments, gloves, and boots over BDUs
causes frustration and/or claustrophobia in many personnel. Long periods of reduced
mobility and sensory awareness degrade attention and alertness and create or increase
feelings of alienation. Chemical filters in the protective mask make breathing more
difficult. This, too, may create feelings of claustrophobia or panic. Combat stress can cause
significant numbers of psychiatric casualties. Estimates range from 10 to 30 percent,
depending on the duration and intensity of battle. Psychological stress stems not only from
the death and destruction that characterize combat but also from the challenging


C-4
operational conditions—noise, confusion, and loss of sleep. Challenging operational
conditions that create fatigue and cause changes in diet and personal hygiene cause
physiological stress as well.

      b.    Mitigation Measures. The adverse impact of psychological stress during MOPP
operations can be minimized by the experience and confidence that realistic training in
MOPP gear with protective mask provides. Use of short rest breaks to provide relief from
MOPP, combined with adequate sleep, food, and drink can sustain performance at optimal
levels (six or more hours of uninterrupted sleep per 24-hour period is optimum; 4 hours is
the minimum for a few days of sustained operations). During the period of 0100 to 0700,
leaders must be aware that the body experiences reduced mental concentration, confusion,
nervousness, and lack of clear thinking. Leaders should plan activities to reduce boredom,
fatigue, inattention, and discomfort. These are major contributors to ineffective
performance.

      c.    Other Mitigation Measures. Leaders can minimize the effects of combat stress by
attaining and maintaining a high level of unit cohesion and individual identity. Units must
train together frequently under demanding conditions. If personnel know that they can
overcome adversity together, unit cohesion will be high. Leaders must take a true interest
in the welfare of their personnel and build the confidence necessary to withstand the effects
of stress. Leaders must keep personnel informed about the tactical situation so that the
adverse effects of ambiguity and uncertainty are minimized. Personnel who become
ineffective as a result of combat stress should be given a period of rest and given
reassurance and support by all members of their unit.

4. Chemical Protective Overgarment Work/Rest Cycles and Water Replacement
Guidelines

Note: The term CPO is used inclusively to refer to all CPOs, such as the JSLIST, BDO, and
saratoga.

      a.    The incidence of heat casualties can be reduced if personnel are allowed to lower
their work intensity and/or take more frequent rest breaks. Table C-2 (page C-6) provides
the information necessary to estimate recommended work/rest and water replacement
cycles for various environmental conditions, clothing levels, and work intensities (Table C-1
[page C-1]] provides examples of work intensities for particular missions/tasks). The
work/rest cycle estimates in Table C-2 (page C-6) are based on keeping the risk of heat
casualties below 5 percent.

      b.    In minimizing heat stress, work/rest schedules may be supplemented by
microclimate cooling (MCC) systems in which an air-or liquid-cooled vest could be worn
under the overgarment to draw body heat away from the skin. MCC systems are available
with STEPO and inside certain combat vehicles, but MCC options are not usually available
for dismounted personnel. Even when work/rest schedules and MCC are used, an increased
risk of performance degradation and heat casualties is inevitable when wearing MOPP in
hot weather.

       Wearing all MOPP overgarments (MOPP4) adds 10° F to WBGT index.

       The work/rest time and fluid replacement volumes will sustain performance and hydration for at least 4 hours of
       work in the specified heat category. Individual water needs will vary ±¼ qt/hr.




     c.    Because of higher body temperatures, personnel in MOPP gear sweat
considerably more than usual. Personnel are aware that they need to remain hydrated,
especially following deployment. Leaders ensure that subordinates maintain proper
hydration, especially in areas of climatic extreme (e.g., desert environments) and they
remain alert to any person showing potential heat stress, stroke, or exhaustion symptoms.
Water must be consumed to replace lost fluids, or dehydration will follow.

     d.    The difficulty of drinking in MOPP increases the likelihood of dehydration.
Thirst is not an adequate indicator of dehydration. Personnel will not sense when they are
dehydrated and will fail to replace body water losses, even when drinking water is readily
available. Furthermore, water can be consumed only through the mask drinking tube (no
additives such as electrolyte replacement can be used). The unit chain of command must
take responsibility for enforcing regular and timely fluid replacement in their personnel.

     e.   Individuals should go into MOPP at full hydration and drink frequently while
working. That is more effective in maintaining hydration than waiting until rest periods to
drink.

     f.    All water (and ice cubes) consumed must be from a medically approved source to
prevent waterborne illnesses. Individuals should carry as much water as possible when
separated from medically approved water sources. Plain water is the beverage of choice,
and personnel will be more likely to drink sufficient water if it is palatable. Whenever
possible, provide cool (60 to 70 degrees F) water. It is much better to drink small amounts
of water frequently than to drink large amounts occasionally.

                         RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION



1.   Background

      Radiological protection involves using OEG as a critical factor in protecting the force.
Radiation exposure can create casualties and must be monitored as another critical element
of the commander’s force health protection program. Commanders must ensure that
accurate records are kept for their personnel and that previous exposure is considered when
selecting individuals and units for missions. Total dose exposure is critical from two
different standpoints. Based on radiation exposure, commanders assess unit capabilities
and the ability of that asset to perform its mission. Additionally, the individual cumulative
dose of each individual service member represents, on a composite basis, the unit’s
radiation exposure status (RES) category. Additionally, paragraphs 3 and 4 of this appendix
address LLR exposure and DU considerations.

2.   Operational Exposure Guidance

     a.   Background.

           (1) OEG gives the commander a flexible system of radiation exposure control.
OEG procedures aid in the successful employment of a unit while keeping the exposure of
personnel to a minimum. Radiation exposure must be controlled to the maximum extent
possible consistent with the mission. If exposure control is ignored, unwarranted risks to
units and personnel will occur. Establishing and using OEG helps the commander keep
radiation exposures to a minimum and still accomplish the mission. OEG is the key for
reducing casualties in a radiological environment.

          (2) All radiation, even in small doses, may have some harmful effect on the
body. Therefore, it is best to avoid all radiation exposures. Exposure should be as low as
reasonably achievable (ALARA) to minimize exposures that would exceed established OEG
levels.

           (3) Establishing OEG must be based on a unit’s prior exposure because of the
cumulative effect of radiation exposure. The commander establishes an OEG for each
tactical operation. Maintaining accurate historical OEG records is crucial in tracking
previous exposure levels.

           (4) An OEG must be established for each unit and each operation. It must be
based upon the RES of the unit at that time and on the current and projected operational
situation.

            (5) The effective use of radiation exposure records permits rapid determination
of a unit’s potential to operate in a radiologically contaminated area. Dose criteria have
been established in four categories: RES-0, RES-1, RES-2, and RES-3. Dose criteria are


                                                                                          D-1
shown in Table D-1, for each category. This information is based on the best available
estimates on predicting the effects of radiation exposure based on the RES of the unit at
that time and on the operational situation. The commander can decide which unit to select
for a given mission based on the OEG. Each level of command can use the OEG system to
select the best unit to conduct a mission. The commander is assured that personnel will
receive the least exposure possible. Commanders include OEG guidance in OPORDs and
units use OEG and RES guidance to accomplish the mission while minimizing radiation
exposure. Based on the OEG, a unit can determine the turnback dose (Dtb) and turnback
dose rate (Rtb) for a military operation (such as a radiological survey) by using the
following formula

                                          (OEG) – Previous Exposure
                                  Dtb =
                                                       2

                                          2 X (OEG – Previous Exposure) X Speed
                                  Rtb =
                                                            Distance

                           125 cGy of radiation.                         emergency risk.
 Note: Nuclear RES guidelines specify units in cGy; however, the US Navy is required by the CFR to conduct
 radiation monitoring in classic radiation units, such as R, rad, or rem. 1 cGy = 1 rad.

           (6) If the dosimeter reading indicates a Dtb and the dose rate is still
increasing, the unit should leave the contaminated area immediately by the same route it
used to enter the area. If the dose rate is decreasing, the commander must decide whether
to continue through the contaminated area (then return to the unit by a clean route) or
leave immediately by the same route used to enter the area.

      b.    Risk Criteria. The degree-of-risk concept helps the commander establish an OEG
for a single operation and minimize the number of radiation casualties. By using the RES
categories (Table D-1) of subordinate units and the acceptable degree of risk, the
commander establishes an OEG based on the degree of risk. There are three degrees of risk:
negligible, moderate, and emergency (See Table D-1). Each risk can be applied to radiation



D-2
hazards from enemy weapons, friendly weapons, or both. Degrees of risk are defined in
percentages of casualties or performance degradation. A casualty is defined as an
individual whose performance effectiveness has dropped by 25 percent from normal.
Specific measures of performance depend on the task. Degradation (nuisance) effects can
include vomiting, skin burns, eardrum rupture, and nausea. These symptoms, at low
radiation levels, may take hours to develop. Individuals thus exposed should be able to
function in the important hours after a nuclear attack and after the first set of symptoms
abate. The casualty data presented in this section is based on a 50 percent confidence level
that the unit is at a 75 percent performance decrement.

           (1) Negligible Risk. Negligible risk is the lowest risk category. The dose is less
than 75 cGy for personnel in RES-0 (with no previous exposure); this dose will not cause
any casualties. Personnel receiving a negligible-risk dose should experience no more than
2.5 percent degradation (nuisance) effects. Negligible risk is acceptable when the mission
requires units to operate in a contaminated area. Negligible risk should not be exceeded
unless a significant advantage will be gained.

           (2) Moderate Risk. Moderate risk is the second risk category. The dose is less
than 100 cGy for personnel in RES-0 (with no previous exposure). This dose generally will
not cause casualties. Troops receiving a moderate-risk dose should experience no more than
5 percent nuisance effects. Moderate risk may be acceptable in close support operations.
Moderate risk must not be exceeded if personnel are expected to operate at full efficiency.

            (3) Emergency Risk. Emergency risk is the final risk category. The dose is any
exposure greater than 125 cGy for personnel in RES-0 with no previous exposure. In this
category, not more than 5 percent casualties are expected. Nuisance effects may exceed the
5 percent level. The emergency-risk dose is only acceptable in rare situations, termed
disaster situations. Only the commander can decide when the risk of the disaster situation
outweighs the radiation emergency risk. The risk criteria for RES-1 and RES-2 categories
are based on assumed average exposures for units in RES-1 and RES-2; this should be used
only when the numerical value of the total past cumulative dose of a unit is unknown.
When the cumulative dose within a category is known, subtract the known dose from the
RES-0 criteria for the degree of use of concern. For example, if a unit in RES-1 received a
dose of 30 cGy, it may receive an additional exposure of 30 cGy before exceeding the
moderate risk.

     c.    Low-Level Radiation Guidance. In operational environments such as MOOTW
situations, units are aware of possible LLR exposure (see Table D-2 [page D-4] for LLR
guidance). Commander’s actions follow the same previous guidance: eliminate or minimize
exposure and monitor unit and personnel radiation exposure. (See Table D-3 [page D-6] for
contamination control guidance for missions of 7 or 90 days.)

           1
             The use of the measurement millisieverts (mSv) is preferred in all cases. However, military organizations
           normally only have the capability to measure cGy. If the ability to obtain measurements in mSv is not
           possible, US forces will use cGy. The USN is required by the code of Federal Regulations to conduct
           radiation monitoring in classic radiation units such as R, Rad, or REM. 1cGy = 1 rad.
           2
            All doses should be kept as low as reasonably achievable. This will reduce individual risk as well as retain
           maximum operational flexability for future employment of exposed persons.
           3
               Examples of priority tasks are those that avert danger to persons and prevent damage from spreading.
           4
               Examples of critical tasks are those that save lives.

      d.   Radiation Exposure Records.

          (1) The OEG concept requires that all units maintain radiation exposure
records. Radiation exposure records are maintained at wing, shipboard, brigade, and
regimental levels of command.

           (2) The NBC staff maintains RES records for all assigned and attached units.
The records are based on exposure data received daily or following a mission in a
radiologically contaminated area. The unit SOP indicates specific reporting procedures.
Monthly records are maintained according to the unit SOP.

      e.   Processing Data.

         (1) The data from flight/section/platoon elements is passed to the applicable
NBC control center (NBCCC). Readings from tactical dosimeters (AN/UDR-13, IM93, or
DT236) are averaged on a daily basis, and an informal record is maintained at


D-4
flight/section/platoon level. The IM93, which works on the principle of electrical collection of
ions, is recharged after each report is submitted or every three days, whichever occurs first.
The AN/UDR-13 can record the total dose for a specific period of time. Prior to nuclear
operations, each unit will read 10 percent of the total DT236s weekly to ensure that no
leakage has occurred. After nuclear operations have commenced in the theater of
operations, one third of the DT236s will be read daily. The DT236s have a response time of
24 hours and ±30 percent accuracy. This is due to the process that the DT236 uses to record
radiation levels (Note: The DT236 is part of the AN/PDR-75.)

           (2) The preferred method of recording individual exposure is based on analysis
of each person’s dosimeter; however, situations may occur in which LLR individual
dosimeters are not available for all potentially exposed personnel. In such situations and
when dosimeters become lost or damaged, special advisors should be consulted for
acceptable, alternative methods of assessing and recording individual exposures.

           (3) Wing, ship, brigade, and battalion elements record and maintain the status
on each assigned or attached element. An overall RES status is reported to the commander
and his staff.

3.   Low-Level Radiation

     a.    Background.

          (1) Prior procedures for the management of radiation exposure basically
assume that nuclear hazards will arise following a nuclear exchange; both procedures and
equipment reflect this. There must be concern, however, for the immediate employment of
personnel (survive to operate), their combat capability, and the health effects on
individuals.

            (2) Radiation hazards could emanate from sources other than a nuclear-
weapon burst and in circumstances other than strategic attack (general war), including
MOOTW situations. Although in some circumstances, the radiation exposures could be high
(e.g., greater than 75cGy) and result in short-term medical effects among the exposed
personnel, it is expected that much lower dose levels are more likely to be encountered in
future operations.

           (3) The purpose of this section is to provide guidelines to the commander for
the protection of personnel during military operation in LLR environments, while
maintaining the operational capability of the deployed force.

     b.   Definitions. LLR is radiation resulting from any cause other than the immediate
nuclear radiation and subsequent direct radioactive fallout from the detonation of a nuclear
weapon.

      c.         LLR Characteristics.

           (1) LLR is always present as background radiation; LLR varies considerably
throughout the world and can even vary considerably within a small locality. It complicates
detection quantification and, hence, interpretation of an LLR hazard.

           (2) LLR may be comprised of dispersed radioactive material (in solid, liquid,
gaseous, or vapor form), or it may be in the form of discrete sources. Alpha, beta, gamma,
and neutron radiation may present LLR hazards:

                (a) Alpha radiation has a very limited range in air (centimeters) and is
not able to penetrate clothing or intact skin. Alpha radiation-emitting material represents
no hazard while outside the body; but in sufficient quantity, it can deliver large radiation
doses to individual organs and may become a serious health hazard if ingested or inhaled.

                (b) Beta radiation has a short range in air (meters), is attenuated by
clothing, and can be stopped by relatively thin layers of most solid materials. Beta
radiation-emitting material represents a hazard if inhaled or ingested and may result in




D-6
high skin doses from external exposures that can manifest into beta burns. Most
radioactive materials emit both beta radiation and gamma radiation.

                 (c) Gamma radiation is easy to detect, but it may be absorbed and
diminished in intensity by dense materials (shielding). Gamma radiation-emitting material
is able to deliver radiation doses to the whole body while remaining outside the body.

                (d) Neutron radiation is penetrating but may be diminished by
interacting with low, atomic number materials. Such interactions may result in the
production of gamma radiation, thus producing multiple types of radiation hazards.
Neutron radiation-emitting material is able to deliver radiation doses to the whole body
while remaining outside the body.

     d.   LLR Sources.

          (1) Civil Nuclear Facilities. These facilities may include those for power
generation; research; and for the processing, storage, and disposal of nuclear waste.

            (2) Industrial and Medical Materials. Wide-scale use of radioactive sources
includes the testing of industrial products, medical or diagnostic treatment, equipment
sterilization, and food processing.

           (3) Radiological Dispersal Devices. Radiological dispersal devices (RDDs) are
designed to release radioactive materials into the environment. This can be achieved by
combining nuclear materials with conventional explosives or combustion to produce
radioactive particles or smoke.

          (4) Radioisotopes. LLR exposure may be caused by radioisotopes in highly
occupied positions, such as aerial ports of debarkation (APODs), seaports of debarkation
(SPODs), or personnel staging areas.

           (5) Nuclear-Weapon Release. A nuclear-weapon release is the spread of fallout
or rainout resulting from the distant (outside the AO) or earlier use (within the AO) of
nuclear weapons.

          (6) Military Commodities. Some military munitions (e.g., DU) and equipment
contain radioactive material, which may present a radiation hazard if disrupted.

     e.   Risk Management.

           (1) Radiation exposure control measures will reflect the need to balance the
duty of care for individuals (recognizing immediate potential hazards, and the risks of long-
term health effects) against the achievement of a military task that might involve life-
threatening activities. Consequently, when planning or implementing operations where
LLR may be or become a factor for consideration, commanders must be capable of making
informed and balanced judgments between their operational obligations at the time and
their duty-of-care responsibilities. Furthermore, the over-riding principal governing all
exposure to radiation is keeping such exposure as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA).




                                                                                           D-7
           (2) Tables D-2 and D-3 (pages D-4 and D-6) provide LLR exposure guidance
and contamination control guidance for commanders. They show radiation exposure
categories and associated doses and recommends actions appropriate to mitigating the risk
to individuals. Although the dose contributed by ingestion or inhalation of radioactive
material (known as internal dose), by partial body irradiations from gamma rays, and by
skin irradiations from beta particles cannot be accurately measured in the field, it can be
estimated for operational purposes. Depending on the type of radioactive material and its
dispersed form, the radiation dose to the tissues and organs can be much larger than the
external dose recorded on a dosimeter. Consequently, respiratory and skin protection must
be considered whenever the hazard analysis establishes that there is a potential risk for
exceeding exposure guidance standards.

          (3) Military operations may require that national peacetime regulations
governing exposure be exceeded. This may be the case particularly in humanitarian, life-
saving and/or emergency situations. All exposure to radiation must be justified by necessity
and subject to controls that maintain ALARA doses. Some of the controls are as follows:

                •   Inform the local civil authorities.

                •   Call for a special monitoring team.

                • Make an estimate and plan of the control measures necessary to contain
the LLR hazard. This should include adherence to the commander’s OEG limit, further
evacuation of the hazard area (if required), and controlled access.

               • Conduct a survey, and confirm the extent of the LLR hazard if LLR
detection equipment and trained personnel are available.

                • Monitor the exposure of personnel who must remain within the hazard
area for operational reasons. These measures will be the responsibility of the commander.

                • Ensure that dosimeters are issued if available. Forces should adopt
respiratory and skin protection measures until analysis establishes that no potential risk
for exceeding internal or skin exposure guidance standards exist.

               • Prevent further access into the defined hazard area and consider OEG
guidance and/or decontamination sites as necessary.

                •   Ensure that food and water from the area is uncontaminated if it is to
be used.

               • Review procedures for limiting the resuspension of ground
contamination if appropriate.

     f.    Contamination Control Considerations. Planning for contamination control can
include the following considerations:

          • Confirmation of the authorized dose limits and the adequacy of exposure
control measures for forces remaining within the hazard area for operational reasons.



D-8
Where dosimeters have not been issued, the level of dose and exposure time will have to be
estimated and recorded.

          • Decontamination in order to render the personnel and equipment leaving the
hazard area safe (specialist advice and monitoring equipment may be required depending
on the nature of the contamination).

           • Reconnaissance and survey to confirm and mark the area, nature, and
intensity of the hazard. Monitoring should continue until operations in that area are
concluded.

     g.   LLR Planning. After assessment, LLR planning addresses the following
considerations:

           • The nature and potential extent of any identified risks including a
description of the possible accident or incident scenarios.

           • Identification of what RADIAC detection equipment is immediately available
in the area of operation and, therefore, what LLR hazard can be detected.

           • The immediate and control actions (including advisory dose limits and the
circumstances and authority required to exceed each incremental dose limit) appropriate to
current local conditions.

         • The issue of available equipment (including dosimeters, spectrometer,
decontamination, and medical measures).

          • The means of assessing national technical advice and support to extend the
detection/monitoring capabilities in the AO.

          • Arrangements for obtaining specialist personnel and equipment, such as
coordinating for teams that are prepared to sample and identify radiological agents.

          •   The informing and training of personnel.

     h.    LLR Hazard Avoidance Considerations. When in the AO, commanders should
avoid exposing their personnel to LLR hazards by taking the following measures:

          •   Obtain information regarding potential hazard areas.

           • Be aware of HN nuclear facilities and other possible radioactive sources and
respect their installation control measures.

          •   Restrict and closely control entry to areas marked by radiological warning
signs.

          • Ensure troops do not tamper with containers marked with radiological
warning signs.




                                                                                           D-9
          • Treat all suspect waste dumps and potential hazard sites with care until
proven clear.

      i.   LLR Protection Considerations (Initial Actions). When a hazard is identified, the
following actions should be taken:

            • Evacuate military personnel (if the situation permits) from the area of
release if it is confined (e.g., inside a hospital). Otherwise, evacuate the area to a radius as
determined by on-scene personnel, taking into account the current military situation. As an
immediate guide, evacuation can be to distances where operationally significant radiation
levels (10 times the natural background readings at 1 meter above the ground) no longer
exist. In the absence of any specific guidance or when under unusual or unforseen
constraints, evacuation to a radial distance of 1 kilometer from the suspected radiation
release point may be employed.

            •   Report the hazard verbally and by using NBC reports.

            • Identify the need and the means to report the hazard, including the warning
of other forces and the HN.

           • Provide specialists to establish the exact nature of the LLR hazard, the
extent of the contamination, and the long-term plan of action.

     j.   LLR Force Health Protection Considerations. Force health protection
considerations include the following actions:

          • Record LLR exposure on personal medical records for long-term health
monitoring. This will involve the medical chain.

            •   Continue to accurately monitor LLR dose rates.

            • Contain and secure the hazard. Obtain samples for detailed analysis and
identification.

          • Conduct long-term health monitoring for those personnel who have been
exposed to radiation on completion of the operation. Postoperation assessment of internal
doses may also be required.

       k.   LLR Psychological Casualties.

           (1) Psychological casualties would seem to be insignificant compared to the
casualties from physical trauma, but they can dramatically alter the outcome of an
operation. The neuropsychiatric casualties of World War II were the largest single cause of
lost military strength in that war. Complicating matters further, psychological stress can
mimic the early symptoms and signs of acute radiation injury. Gastrointestinal symptoms
(nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), fatigue, and headaches were frequent symptoms during
episodes of battle fatigue in World War II. In an RDD or a nuclear incident scenario,
psychological stress is also a factor. Even if neuropsychiatric trauma does not produce a
casualty, it can degrade the performance of normal duties. Slightly altered reaction times,
inattention, or motivation have important consequences across the entire spectrum of


D-10
military operations. Regardless of the situation, it must be emphasized that the most
extreme psychological damage occurs when physiological symptoms from an unknown toxic
exposure become manifest.

           (2) An RDD or a nuclear incident would likely produce acute anxiety effects,
including psychosomatic effects such as nausea and vomiting. Symptoms of acute radiation
sickness in just a few personnel might trigger an outbreak of similar symptoms in the unit
and/or in the civilian populace.

            (3) Exposure or perceived exposure to radiation can be expected to increase the
number of psychological stress casualties. The number of casualties will also depend on the
level of leadership, cohesiveness, and morale in the unit. Long-term chronic psychological
stress patterns could be expected to arise from the uncertainty about the effects of exposure
to radiation. Some of the potential effects include phobias, depression, and posttraumatic
stress disorder.

            (4) The most frequent psychological effect after disasters is a temporary
emotional disruption where people are stunned or dazed; this transient response may last
minutes or days. Typically, such individuals will be able to respond to strong leadership
and direction. Another psychological response is to become more efficient in the face of
danger; this is more likely in well-trained units with high morale. A third type of response
is that of a psychological casualty, where the transient emotional disruption continues and
is more severe. Reactions include stunned, mute behavior; tearful helplessness; apathy;
inappropriate activity; and preoccupation with somatic symptoms (often of emotional
origin).

           (5) The most stressful effects of a fallout field or contaminated area are likely
to be the uncertainties of the levels of radiation present, the lack of defined boundaries of
the area, and the perceived acute and chronic effects of radiation.

           (6) Even in the absence of actual exposure, thoughts that one has been exposed
to radiation may cause fear and anxiety.

          (7) The treatment of psychological stress resulting from actual or perceived
exposure to radiation is the same as that for battle fatigue. The principles of proximity,
immediacy, expectancy, and simplicity are the cornerstones of treatment.

            (8) Prevention, when possible, is always preferred to treatment. Prior to
deployment to an area where nuclear and radiological hazards are present, medical
personnel can implement programs on behalf of line commanders that instruct their units
about radiation and its effects. In general, personnel who are psychologically prepared for
specific stresses are better able to endure them and will suffer fewer and less severe
adverse reactions. This same principle is widely used in preparing troops to cope with
MOPP gear, chemical agent exposure, and other adverse environments. Postexposure
training will be much less effective.




                                                                                             D-11
4.     Depleted Uranium

    a.   Background. DU is an extremely dense metal used in munitions to penetrate
heavy armor or as protective shielding (armor packages).

     b.   Exposure. DU exposure and incidents may occur anytime there is damage to the
DU armor package—a vehicle is hit with DU munitions, DU munitions are damaged, or
equipment components containing DU are damaged. The DU armor can be damaged during
vehicle maneuvers, on-board fires, maintenance activities, or ballistic impacts. DU
munition problems may occur as an occupational exposure during storage, transportation,
combat, testing, or manufacturing. DU contamination may be present on the ground in
areas where equipment was destroyed or damaged.

     c.     Contamination. DU contamination may include DU oxides (dust), contaminated
shrapnel, munitions components, or armor components. DU primarily emits alpha
particles; however, beta, gamma, and X-ray ionizing radiation are also emitted. DU
contamination can be inhaled, ingested, injected, or absorbed through open cuts or wounds.
DU contamination does not pose an immediate health risk. Consequently, contamination
should be removed from personnel or vehicle surfaces when directed by the unit commander
based on METT-T. See Table D-4 for information on recommended maximum-permissible
contamination levels.

      d.   Presence of DU. Visual signs that DU contamination is present immediately
after a high-heat event (impact and/or fire) include heavy, dull black dust or small round
holes. DU fragments or residues that have weathered in the environment may exhibit a
green or yellow appearance. DU contamination can only be verified with a radiac meter. An
AN/VDR-2 or AN/PDR-77 with an alpha probe or beta (flat pancake) probe is used to detect
and measure DU contamination. Care should be taken when surveying with the alpha
probe to prevent puncturing the probe window, which renders the probe useless.

     e.   Protection. When working on or within DU-contaminated equipment, personnel
must wear gloves, use respiratory protection (e.g., painter mask, bandana, surgical mask),
and wear coveralls or roll down their sleeves and blouse their trousers as directed by unit
chemical or medical personnel.

      f.   Procedures. General procedures to follow when working around DU include the
following:

           •   Use a radiac meter to determine if DU-contamination is present.

         • Provide protection, including appropriate clothing, for workers as directed by
unit NBC or medical personnel.

           •   Identify what is to be decontaminated.

           •   Obtain necessary equipment and materials.

            • Brush, wash, or wipe off contamination with a damp cloth. Use a high-
efficiency, particulate air (HEPA) vacuum cleaner if available.


D-12
            •    Work from the outside to the inside of the contaminated area.

            •    Cover fixed contamination with tape, paint, paper, plastic, or other disposable
material.

          • Use the standard, double-bag and-tag process for hazardous waste. The only
contaminated waste generated by DU will be the vacuum cleaner bags after use on multiple
vehicles.

                TOXIC INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS-
     AN ASSESSMENT OF NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, AND CHEMICAL
                    FILTER PERFORMANCE


1.    Background

      This appendix provides information and data on the assessment of NBC filter
performance as they relate to protection against selected TICs. The filter performance data
only provides supporting technical information for NBC planners. The TIC protection
actions described in Chapter II remain as the primary basis for a response to an incident or
accident. The most important action in case of massive TIM release is immediate
evacuation outside the path of the hazard. The greatest risk from a large-scale, toxic-
chemical release occurs when personnel receive little or no warning, are unable to escape
the immediate area, and are overcome by vapors. Military respirators and protective
clothing may provide only limited protection against TIC. Units use the US Department of
Transportation, Emergency Response Guidebook, and FM 8-500, Hazardous Materials
Injuries; a Handbook for Prehospital Care, to identify protection requirements for specific
material. The protective mask and ensemble and military standard COLPRO filters will
likely provide only limited protection.

      Important considerations are required when assessing potential TIM releases and
protection, detection, and documentation capabilities and limitations available to forces
using military NBC defense equipment. During TIM releases, the local military response
should be local area evacuation (directly out of the downwind hazard plume,
perpendicularly to the downwind direction, and uphill if possible). Individual military
protective equipment use in unknown TIM release areas is only appropriate as an
emergency escape means. Fixed TIM sites allow for friendly force preplanning to avoid
positioning resources in potential TIM release hazard areas. Mobile TIM transport means
could cause TIM release events (with little notice) that could occur unexpectedly with
dangerous, unknown combinations of substances that may be toxic, flammable, and/or
water-reactive.

2.    Filter System Operations

       a.   This assessment applies to multiple sets of NBC filters (e.g., C2A1 canister,
M12A2 gas filter, M18 gas filter, M49 gas filter, M48 gas filter, M23 Filter. 200 CFM filter,
and Advanced, Integrated Collective Protection System [AICPS] filter). The fact that US
NBC filters are designed to process equivalent amounts of chemicals per quantity of
activated carbon enables the performance of specific filters to be estimated from a single
filter configuration.

     b.   NBC filtration systems consist of a particulate filter to remove liquid and solid
phase toxic particulate materials followed by a vapor filter to remove vapor phase toxic
chemicals. The vapor filter consists of activated carbon, which has been impregnated with



                                                                                          E-1
reactive materials. This impregnated and activated carbon filters vapors by two
mechanisms—physical adsorption in the pores of the activated carbon and chemical
reaction with the impregnants. Low-vapor pressure chemicals, such as nerve and mustard
agents, are removed very effectively by physical adsorption alone in the microporous
structure of the carbon. Relatively high-vapor pressure agents, such as the blood agents
(cyanogen chloride and hydrogen cyanide), are not strongly, physically adsorbed and will
quickly penetrate a nonreactive activated carbon. Thus, specific reactive chemicals have
been identified which chemically decompose those high-vapor pressure agents. These
reactive chemicals are impregnated on the activated carbon so as to provide effective
filtration of all chemical warfare agents.

     c.    CW agent vapor filters contain the reactive adsorbent ASC carbon (ASC is not an
acronym; but it is a specific designator for activated carbon that has been impregnated with
type ASC solution, which is a mixture of copper, chromium and silver) or they contain
ASZM-TEDA (copper-silver-zinc-molybdenum-triethylenediamine) carbon (a chromium-free
carbon). The protection provided by these two sorbents against CW agents is nearly
equivalent. Both ASC carbon and ASZM-TEDA carbon were developed specifically to filter
CW agent vapors. However, the adsorbents are also effective in filtering a wide variety of
industrial chemical vapors, particularly those that are strongly adsorbed.
3.    Filter Assessment
     a.   Historically, CW agents have consisted primarily of analogs of nerve, mustard,
cyanide, and arsine—as well as a number of industrial-type chemicals, such as chlorine,
phosgene, and chloropicrin. Of the tens of thousands of TIC produced worldwide, there are
many that present an aerosol hazard and are produced in large quantities. A trinational
group (the US, Canada, and the United Kingdom) researched the broad issue of industrial-
based chemicals, and the study effort resulted in the identification of selected TIC that are
widely produced, stored, and transported; easily vaporized; and highly toxic (see Table E-1).
The selected chemicals were prioritized into three hazard index rankings as provided by an
international task force: 21 high, 41 medium, and 36 low-hazard vapors and gases.

     b.    The listing of the TIC (Table E-1) represents a broad range of physical and
chemical properties. Chemical families consist of halides (fluoride, chloride, bromide, and
iodide), cyanides, cyanates, amines, oxides of carbon and nitrogen, ketones, aldehydes,
esters, phosphates, thiols, and heavy metals (lead and titanium). This information shows


                                                                                                           E-3
that about 75 percent of the chemicals have a vapor pressure above 10 mm mercury, a state
at which the strength of physical adsorption is reduced more rapidly on activated carbon
and is a greater concern with respect to desorption.

       c.   Table E-1 provides, in summary form, assessment results of the protection
afforded by NBC filters to the selected TICs. The filter assessment indicated that many of
the TIC could be effectively removed by the filter (effective), minimally removed by the
filter (poor), or partially removed by the filter (marginal). However, variables, such as being
near the explosive and meteorological conditions, could affect the assessment. Several of the
TICs were effectively removed by NBC filters; however, almost equal numbers were
assessed as performing poorly (P) or marginally (M).

     d.    Table E-1 provides data to only support unit planning. For example, this data
could be used to support risk assessments based on IPB evaluations (e.g., types of TIC
found in an AOI) furnished by the intelligence officer or the staff surgeon. However,
military units (except for special-purpose units like EOD or HAZMAT response teams) lack
the capability to detect most TIC; the unit response to TIC incidents/accidents remains as
described in Chapter II.
Note: This summary only addresses several of the TIC that represent an aerosol hazard and
are produced in large quantities. There are many other TIC that present other hazards
such as flammability and oxygen depletion, etc. Consult the technical references for specific
information on TIC hazards, safety considerations, and other applicable emergency
response guidelines.

              NONCOMBATANT EVACUATION OPERATIONS


1.   Background

     This appendix provides an overview of NEOs and provides information that could be
used to support military unit planning and noncombatant evacuees (NCEs). The primary
focus of an NEO is to move NCEs safely and quickly away from danger.

(Note: The information provided in this appendix is very general. Specific details will vary
depending on individual situations, and detailed prior planning by commanders will help
support successful mission execution.)

2.   Planning

     Military planners recognize the importance of NEO and its direct link to successful
mission accomplishment. Military planners involved in the NEO planning and execution
consider several aspects affecting its potential implementation:
     •   All American citizens should be treated equally.
     • US citizens have evacuation priority, but NEO execution may also involve support
to NCE who are not US citizens. Other nations are expected to request evacuation support
from the US Department of State (DOS). Upon DOS approval, third-country nationals
(TCNs) from countries who have been authorized assistance will be included in the NEO
processing.

      • NEO support planning covers the response to any crisis that could lead to a
decision to direct an ordered evacuation.

3.   Stages of Noncombatant Evacuation Operations

There are five stages of an NEO—alert, assembly, relocation, evacuation, and repatriation.

     a.    Alert. NCEs will be notified of an impending crisis that may require relocation or
evacuation and be provided appropriate instructions from commanders through their
installation NEO representatives.

     b.    Assembly. Following instructions to assemble, NCEs will move to an evacuation
control center (ECC). Some NCEs may be instructed to remain in their quarters or existing
shelters to minimize the risk and ensure a manageable flow into the evacuation system.

      c.   Relocation. The movement of NCEs to another location is called relocation.
Relocation will be conducted to move NCEs from ECCs to sites of greater relative safety
called relocation centers (RCs) or APODs where they will board transportation.




                                                                                           F-1
     d.   Evacuation. The movement of NCEs from an area to a safe haven is called
evacuation.

      e.   Repatriation. Upon arrival in CONUS, NCEs are repatriated.



4. Noncombatant Evacuation Operations in a Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical
Environment

     This paragraph outlines some of the hazards that could face NEO personnel in a
contaminated environment and describes individual survivability methods (with and
without specialized equipment).

a.   Planning Considerations. The following planning considerations may apply; however,
each NEO situation will be different:

           (1) Most airlift NEO evacuations may take place during retrograde time-
phased, force and deployment operations (e.g., military forces and equipment brought to the
APOD will be downloaded from the aircraft, the NEO passengers and equipment will be
loaded as necessary, and the aircraft will depart for a location outside of the immediate
threat area).

           (2)   Some NEO personnel may be present at APODs during attack situations.

           (3) Most NEO personnel will probably not have respiratory protection and/or
protective overgarments.

       b.  Transforming Living Quarters or Other Facilities into NBC Collective Protective
Shelters. Certain key things must be understood about the nature of NBC agents and their
interaction with the environment when planning the transformation of facilities into
protective shelters for NEO personnel. In most cases, hazardous CB agent vapors will
remain relatively low to the ground. Consequently, shelters established on the second or
third floors of buildings will typically be safer from CB agents than locations on the ground
floor.

           (1) When transforming areas into CPSs, consider the following factors and
select the area based on—

               • Size requirements (the number of people expected to use the shelter and
the expected duration of stay).

                 •   Access to a telephone.

                 •   Access to running water, cooking facilities, etc.

                 •   The distance above ground level (the higher the better).

                 •   The distance from nearest vegetation (the farther the better).



F-2
               • The realistic number of VBs that can be constructed between the shelter
area and ground level.

                   • The number and location of agent access points to the inside of the
facility (e.g., doors, windows, fireplaces, external air vents).

           (2)   Additionally, consider taking the following actions when preparing the CPS.

                  (a) Cover and seal with tape all direct access points to the inside of the
facility (fireplaces, external air vents, etc.).

                 (b) Select one entry/exit point for the facility. If possible, use the
entry/exit point that has the most concrete or asphalt (minimum soil or vegetation)
immediately around it. Lock all other doors. Leave the keys in the doors in case an
emergency escape is necessary.

                 (c) Create a decontamination station just inside the entry/exit door. This
station may include bleach in containers (troughs) (for personnel to step into) and hand
buckets (for glove and/or hand decontamination). The entry/exit door should also have a
container for contaminated-item disposal and a sharp knife or pair of scissors for cutting off
contaminated clothing.

               (d) Minimize splintering by taping windows and boarding them with
plywood, cardboard, or some other suitable material.

                (e) Use a substance, such as duct tape, to seal all potential agent access
areas (doors, windows, openings around window air conditioners, etc.).

                (f) Create artificial VBs by taping large, plastic sheets to the walls inside
hallways, the top and bottom of stairwells, etc.

                (g) Construct a personnel safety zone in the center of the living area
(location where personnel will remain during attack situations). Accomplish this by—

                     • Creating a physical barrier between the personnel safety zone and
the outside building wall by moving furniture (dressers, chairs, bookcases, etc.) around the
safety zone.

                      • Erecting a tent or similar structure in the safety zone. This
structure will serve as the final protective layer during an attack situation. The object is to
prevent physical contact with contamination if an explosion breaches the outer wall.

                (h) Turn off the air conditioners/heating systems, or ensure that they can
be turned off within seconds if an attack warning is received.

                  (i) Determine the suitability of air supply in the living area (amount and
staleness). When the shelter is known to be in an uncontaminated area, unseal an access
point, let fresh air in, and reseal the access point if necessary.

                 (j)   Ensure that the following items are accessible:


                                                                                               F-3
                     • Decontamination buckets and materials (to include knife/scissors
and containers for contaminated-waste disposal.

                       • Food and water supplies. Personnel should have enough food and
water to last at least 72 hours without requiring electric or gas cooking facilities.

                     •   Fire extinguisher.

                     •   Light sources (preferably flashlights with a supply of batteries).

                     •   Clothing.

      c.   Protection Afforded by Various Clothing Items. It is important to realize that
clothing items other than specialized protective equipment will provide a degree of
protection against agent contamination and exposure. The following are recommended
clothing items to include levels and layers to aid in protection:

           (1) During Attack. In order to maximize protection, NEO personnel should
have at least two layers of clothing (in addition to underwear) on at the time of attack. This
configuration would allow the removal of contaminated outer garments while still retaining
a degree of protection from contact with the agent or its vapors. Specifically, NEO personnel
should adhere to the following concepts:

                •   The acquisition of respiratory protection is the utmost priority.

                • Military issue protective masks should be used. If they are not
available, personnel should acquire commercially available carbon filter, vapor protection
masks (e.g., paint or pesticide delivery masks). Dust or surgical masks are not appropriate.
If commercial masks are not available, personnel should fashion a close-knit material
around their noses and mouths. The material should be wetted with water.

                 • The inner clothing layer should cover as much of the body as possible
(e.g., long pants and shirts versus shorts and T-shirts).

                 • The inner clothing layer should consist of dense, tightly-woven fabrics
(e.g., denim versus cotton-knitted materials).

                •   The outer clothing layer should be water-resistant (e.g., poncho or
raincoat).

                • The outer clothing layer should have minimal seams, zippers, and
buttons. Each of these areas represents a weak spot compared to the rest of the garment.

                • A hood or hat should be worn to provide protection for the head area.
The same concepts (dense, tightly-woven fabric) used for clothing also apply to the best
choice of material for a hood or hat.

                •   Gloves should be worn.




F-4
                • Heavy boots (covering the ankle) are the best choice. If available, outer,
heavy rubber, rain boots should be worn over inner shoes. The inner shoes should have
rubber or hard-leather soles.

                  • Garment openings (in between buttons or snaps, sleeve openings, etc.)
should be taped shut. The garments should be taped over the top (cuff) of the gloves and the
top of the boots.

           (4) During Transport from Shelter to Passenger Waiting Area/Aircraft. The
same concepts expressed in paragraph c (1) apply here. The exception is that personnel
should wear three layers of clothing over their underwear versus two. Two layers should be
water-resistant (poncho or rain suit count as a layer) and worn over an inner layer of dense
fabric because personnel may be contaminated during the transportation process (either
contact or vapor absorption) from their shelter to the passenger waiting area.

            (5) Recommended Clothing Preparation Activities. During the preattack stage,
NEO personnel should double-bag each set of clothing that offers protective capabilities but
is not being worn and seal the closure with tape or a knot. This will prevent the inadvertent
loss of clothing as a result of contamination breaching the shelter area.

     d.   Decontamination Operations.

           (1) Given the possibility that NEO personnel may not have access to
specialized decontamination kits or equipment, they must be able to use readily obtainable
items to accomplish required decontamination operations. Further, it is important that
NEO personnel understand the basic tenants associated with contamination control
operations. Specifically—

                • Know that contamination avoidance is the best defense. Protecting
personnel or materials by providing cover (layers of clothing, double bagging, etc.) that
prevents direct contact with the agent is the single most important factor.

               • Recognize and understand the hazard. Personnel must be able to
distinguish what chemical contamination looks like and where it is likely to be.

                • Decontaminate exposed skin areas immediately (within seconds).
Rapidly (within minutes) decontaminate clothing items, remembering that removal is an
effective decontamination method.

                 • Keep as much distance between themselves and the contamination as
possible. Use standoff decontamination systems, such as a mop, whenever possible. Never
directly touch the contamination with exposed skin.

                • Clean gloves routinely by dipping them in decontamination buckets
containing a 5 percent solution of chlorine (undiluted household bleach) and rinsing them
with clear water (just a couple of seconds in each).




                                                                                            F-5
              • Use military detectors, if available, to assess the effectiveness of
decontamination operations. Recognize that a vapor hazard, however small, may still exist
even though M8 or M9 detection paper readings are negative.

               • Remove the hazard, if possible. For example, if a chair was the only
thing contaminated in a room (due to a breach through a broken window for instance), the
best option might be to remove the chair.

          (2) Decontamination Methods. NEO personnel may use the following items to
achieve reasonable decontamination results:

                      (a)    Chlorine Solutions. A 5 percent chlorine solution (bleach) is an
exceptionally effective decontaminating agent for material. Directly apply the chlorine
solutions (undiluted household bleach) to the surface and rinse it with clear water.
Scrubbing the area is generally not necessary. Use a chlorine solution in buckets and
troughs for glove/boot decontamination operations.

                      (b)    Miscellaneous Items. Personnel can use rags, paper towels,
dirt, sawdust, or any other absorbent material to remove chemical contamination.

       e.   Attack Response Actions for NEO Personnel.

            (1)   Preattack.

                  •   Seek shelter by moving to the designated shelters.

                • Protect unused food, clothing, and water supplies. Accomplish this by
sealing the items in appropriate containers, double-bagging, etc.

                  •   Remain prepared according to the guidelines contained in paragraph c
(1).

            (2)   During Attack.

                  •   Take cover in the central shelter area.

                • Decontaminate clothing and/or skin immediately if contamination
enters the shelter area.

            (3)   Postattack.

                  •   Remain calm. Check individuals for contamination, and decontaminate,
as necessary.

               • Check the shelter area for contamination. Assess the situation and
decontaminate or relocate as necessary.

                  •   Seek medical attention as required.




F-6
               • Verify the integrity and contamination status of the entire shelter
system. Do not venture outside. Reseal and/or repair items as necessary.

 NUCLEAR, BIOLOGICAL, AND CHEMICAL DEFENSE EQUIPMENT
                         DATA
        The information in this appendix provides national stock numbers (NSNs) for
selected items of NBC defense equipment (see Table G-1 [page G-2]). The information in the
table is extracted from the Federal Logistics (FED LOG) data dated 1 October 2001. The
basis of issue (BOI) will depend on service-specific authorization documents. FED LOG
data changes periodically; therefore, NSNs and item descriptions must be checked
according to applicable service logistics directives. Table G-1 (page G-2) serves only as a
guide.

                                         Appendix H

     WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION THREATS USING POSTAL
                      MAIL/PACKAGES




1.    Background

      This appendix provides guidance on steps to take when and if a suspect letter/package
is received opened or unopened. Recent criminal and/or terrorist events/threats involving
the mail system have prompted personnel to be alert for and recognize suspicious parcels
and letters as a FP initiative. Becoming familiar with the characteristics of suspect parcels
can help avert a tragedy.

2.    Possible Indicators and Characteristics of Suspect Mail/Packages

     Any suspicious looking package or letter should be considered a potential bomb/hazard
and should be treated accordingly. Possible indicators may include—

      •   Inaccurate addressee name or title.

      •   Fictitious or unavailable return address.

      •   No return address.

      •   Handwritten or poorly-typed address.

     • Distorted handwriting or name and address prepared with homemade labels or
cut-and-paste lettering.

      •   Misspelled common words.

      •   Restrictive markings such as “personal” or “confidential.”

      •   Protruding wires, aluminum foil, or oil stains.

      •   Excessive weight or a feeling of powdery substance or liquid on the package.

      •   Peculiar smell emitting from the package.

      •   Cancelled postmark being from a different location than the return address.

      •   Excessive postage.

      •   Rigidness, unevenness, or lopsidedness.




                                                                                          H-1
     • Unprofessional wrapping with several combinations of tape used to secure the
package. May be endorsed “Fragile—Handle With Care” or “Rush—Do Not Delay.”

      •    Irregular shape, soft spots, or bulges.

      •    Sloshing sound.

      •    Pressure or resistance being felt when removing contents.

3.    Handling Instructions

      a.    Suspicious, unopened letter/package.

            (1)   Do not open the letter/package.

           (2)    Isolate and contain the letter/package immediately. Do not touch, shake, or
tear it open.

          (3) Leave the room, and close the door or section off the area to prevent others
from entering.

          (4) Contact the supervisor, law enforcement officials, and the specialists for
help and to report the location and description of the letter/package.

           (5) Wash your hands with soap and water if contact with the outside of the
letter/package is made.

           (6) Start a list of names and telephone numbers of all persons who have
handled the letter/package. Give the list to law enforcement officials for follow-up
investigations and advice.

            (7)   Wait for help to arrive.

      b.    Opened letter/package that contains a powdery substance.

          (1) If the letter has already been opened and powder spills out, do not clean it
up or brush it off clothing. Do not disturb the package any further. Do not pass the
package around. Keep others away from the area.

           (2) Cover the letter/package with cloth, plastic, paper, or a container, if
conditions permit, to limit and/or contain aerosolization of the powder. (This must be
performed with resources located in the immediate vicinity without leaving the room and in
less than a minute, so improvise. If the letter/package cannot be covered, exit the area
immediately.)

           (3) Leave the contaminated area, go to a clean isolated area, and close off the
area to limit access to the package. Lock the room, and/or leave a guard outside. Place a
sign explaining the emergency, and restrict access/entrance into the contaminated area.




H-2
          (4)   Keep your hands away from your face to avoid contaminating eyes, nose, or
mouth.

           (5) Wash hands with soap and water and flush eyes with water immediately
(without leaving the area).

           (6) Shut down the building ventilation system, and turn off fans and
equipment that are circulating air around the workspace if possible. This will minimize
aerosolization of the substance.

          (7) Notify the supervisor, law enforcement officials, and other emergency
response personnel.

          (8)   Notify local, county, and state health officials.

          (9)   Ensure that all persons who have handled the letter/package wash their
hands.

          (10) Start a list of names and telephone numbers of all personnel who have
handled the letter/package.

            (11) Give potentially exposed persons information about the signs and
symptoms of illness associated with the biological agent and who to contact and where to go
if illness develops.

            (12) Place all clothing items worn when in contact with the letter/package into
plastic bags. Keep the bags with you at all times to maintain the chain of custody and
control of the contaminated clothing and to limit the spread of contamination. Turn the
bags over to law enforcement officials for necessary disposition and medical analysis.

           (13) Shower with soap and water as soon as possible (ensure that all exposed
skin is washed and rinsed to remove contamination, and rinse your eyes with clear water).
Do not use bleach or disinfectant on skin.

     c.   Suspected improvised explosive device (IED) that arrives in a letter or package.

         (1) Do not touch, shake, or tear open the letter/package. Evacuate the area
immediately. If the mail is opened, do not touch, shake, drop, or handle it any further.

          (2)   Restrict access to the area.

          (3) Call law enforcement officials. Remain in the general area to await first
responder, law enforcement, and supervisory personnel.

     d.   Individual and response team actions.

           (1) Actions taken by mail personnel when handling opened and unopened
suspicious letters/packages are similar to those described earlier; however, mail room
personnel may don the following protective gear prior to handling packages to reduce/limit
the exposure to CB hazards:


                                                                                           H-3
                •   Respirator of a specified type (dust masks).

                •   Gloves (latex or approved).

                •   Long-sleeved clothing.

                •   Disposable aprons.

                •   Eye goggles.

          (2) Actions taken by responding teams when notified of an incident involving a
suspected package containing hazardous materials may include the following:

                (a) Arrive on the scene with appropriate protective gear, decontamination
supplies, water, plastic bags, and coveralls (for affected personnel needing fresh clothing).

                (b) Secure the area to minimize the spread of contamination, protect the
crime scene (for later evidence collection), decontaminate those persons affected, and
remove them for medical treatment.

                (c) Assist affected persons. Decontamination procedures for affected
persons will vary depending on the degree of exposure. All persons in the room are at risk.
The person who opened the package and any others who came in contact with the package
after it was opened are at greatest risk. Assist affected persons by ensuring that they—

                     • Wet down their clothing with water or diluted bleach to reduce the
risk of secondary aerosols.

                      •   Remove their clothing and personal items and place them in
marked bags.

                      •   Wash their hands.

                      •   Change into fresh clothing.

                    • Wash thoroughly with soap and water, if a shower is available,
shampoo hair, and change into fresh clothing.

                  (d) If a shower is not available, change into fresh clothing to mitigate the
possibility of transfer of contamination; and then transport personnel to established
decontamination and treatment facilities. Upon completion of showers and
decontamination, personnel will change into fresh clothing.

                (e) Give potentially exposed personnel information about the signs and
symptoms of illness associated with the hazard and who to contact and where to go if illness
develops.




H-4
4.    Reach-Back Capability

     In response to a report of a suspected letter/package, the technical reach-back
capability is available if technical issues exceed on-site, local, subject matter experts (SME)
capabilities (see Table H-1). Reach back should be conducted using established local
protocols and SOPs. Local information management protocols and the chain of command
must be followed prior to using any of the listed hot-line numbers.

                                         Appendix I
        PROTECTIVE MASK PRESCRIPTION OPTICAL INSERTS



1.   Background

      Over 40 percent of military service members wear prescription eyewear. Those
individuals who have a visual acuity of less than 20/40 (20/20 is required for some
professions, such as pilots) with their eyewear removed are required to use prescription
inserts when using their masks (Army Regulation [AR] 40-63/NAVMEDCOMINST
6810.1/Air Force Reserve [AFR] 163-7), Ophthalmic Services, 1 January 1986. This
appendix describes the prescription optical inserts for protective masks currently in use,
the insert installation instructions, and the insert procurement information.

2.   M40/M42 Series

    The M40 is the general-purpose mask for USA and USMC infantry and civilian
workers replacing the M9, M17, and M25 mask series. Sizes for the mask are small,
medium, and large.

      a.   Optical Inserts, Ground Use. The inserts are nickel silver metal with temple
rings that insert into the eye ring of the mask. The front is a 44-mm eye size for the optical
correction, a 74-mm frame size, and a spring-hinged bridge. The temples swivel forward of
the frame front to spring-fit into the mask eye ring.

            (1) Installation. Hold the insert temples by the plastic tabs, and swivel them
in front of the frame front. Insert the lower section of one temple in the lower groove of the
mask eye ring just behind the mask lens, and continue around the entire temple until it
springs into place. Repeat for the other side.

          (2) Procurement. The insert is ordered from the military optical laboratories
through the military eye clinic.

Note: The ophthalmic laboratories are in the process of changing the ground use masks to
the same insert system as the aviation version. See the following paragraphs for insert
description, installation, and procurement instructions for the aviation type insert.

     b.    Optical Inserts, Aviation Use. The prescription lenses are mounted in the
prescription lens carrier (PLC) frame. The PLC is attached to the black, plastic mount

      ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE PROTECTION CONSIDERATIONS




1.   Background

     The EMP resulting from a nuclear weapon detonation can adversely affect
unhardened electrical devices. When the detonation is well above the earth, EMP can cover
the entire battlespace. The same detonation on or near the earth causes more intense, but
more localized EMP. For these reasons, equipment supporting critical missions must, as a
minimum, survive high altitude EMP effects. Such equipment survivability can be
achieved by hardening the equipment or by using other mitigation techniques.

2.   Electromagnetic Pulse

      Electromagnetic pulse is a nuclear weapons effect that can have an adverse impact on
electrical and electronic equipment. Although it represents roughly 1 percent of the total
energy produced by a nuclear burst, EMP can destroy or cause serious damage to electronic
equipment through electrical-current surges. Digital electronics can also suffer upset
conditions that are also serious. Unfortunately, standard devices that protect equipment
against lightning do not necessarily provide protection against EMP. Units must ensure
that OPLANs include mitigation techniques to reduce EMP effects on operations.


3.   Electromagnetic Pulse Mitigation Techniques

      a.   EMP mitigation procedures use hardened equipment and/or unhardened
equipment. Correct maintenance and operational procedures help ensure that the
hardness of built-in equipment remains intact. Improper maintenance can readily reduce
or eliminate EMP hardening. Unhardened equipment relies on operator mitigation to
reduce EMP coupling to levels below upset or damage.

           (1) Exercise caution when adding components to already hardened equipment,
such as placing new systems in a hardened van or mobile shelter.

           (2) As a general rule, making an addition to stand-alone equipment that does
not have wires or connectors running outside the protected enclosure does not interfere
with the EMP hardening of the shelter. However, any addition of new connectors (such as
running a telephone wire or extra air-conditioning or ventilation hoses into a shelter) that
does not go through an approved surge arrestor and penetration shield or connector can
adversely affect the hardness of the protected area. The addition of more sensitive
electrons inside the protected enclosure can also affect hardness.

     b.   Many EMP hardening designs create shields between the electronic equipment
and external EMP environments. Any cable or other penetration in a hardened system that



                                                                                          J-1
creates a hole or gap in the shield can degrade system survivability. Gaps, seals, and
closures should be intact and fully engaged. Necessary maintenance or modifications made
to systems should attempt to reseal and restore any breaks in the shielding.

      c.   When possible, EMP effects can be mitigated by having approved nonelectronic
or alternative electronic procedures, backup systems, and backup copies of critical
electronic data available for use. Multiple electronic systems of similar function can
provide alternate or backup systems to supplement the functionality of potentially
vulnerable high- and ultra-high frequency radios. Full restoration of EMP-damaged or
disrupted computer information systems requires that replacement or repaired systems
have operationally critical data from backups for immediate installation. Stored, backup
CISs can provide replacement hardware. Frequent backups of critical operational data in
durable media formats further provide the data needed to resume any disrupted operations.

      d.   Other mitigation measures can include—

           •   Making maximum use of the least vulnerable equipment when possible.

           •   Providing redundant, multiple-mode communication links between positions.

          • Preplanning and training to use backup and alternate communications
networks. When possible, establish two or more communications paths and have a
contingency plan to reestablish communications.

            • Maintaining a stock of critical spare parts. In some cases, EMP damage may
affect only one part of a system, which if replaced, will allow the device to function as
before. Fuses are particularly important; therefore, personnel need to know the location of
all fuses in their equipment and maintain and keep spares on hand. Critical spares and
parts should be sealed in their original, electrostatic discharge (ESD) containers or bags
until needed for use.

            • Integrating EMP concerns into safety plans and drills. For example,
personnel need to practice the skills needed to extinguish sudden, multiple, EMP-induced
electrical fires inside shelters and enclosures and have appropriate life-support and fire-
fighting equipment at hand.

      e.   Components, such as antennas and other metallic surfaces can be EMP-
concentrating items. Potential antennas include such objects as gun tubes, heating and
ventilation ducts, water pipes, fuel pipelines, conduits, grounding rods and wires,
commercial phone and power lines, missiles, guy wires, fences, railroad tracks, and power
lines from generators.

          (1) When possible, personnel should disconnect and collapse collectors or
antennas. Simply turning off the equipment is not sufficient; damaging energy can still
enter through antennas.

          (2) Where possible, personnel should avoid use of the most vulnerable
antennas, which include long wires or rods, wide-angle doublets, and omnidirectional
antennas. Less vulnerable antennas include those with smaller radiating elements.



J-2
            (3) Additionally, personnel should avoid the creating loops in wire and other
antennas or collectors. Loops act as magnetic dipole antennas, allowing EMP energy to
affect the systems connected to them. Operators and supervisors should also recognize the
different types of systems that might be linked in loops that are not immediately obvious.
For example, a phone line may run from a van to a switchboard; the switchboard may be
linked by wire to a CP, the CP may have a power line connection to a generator, and the
same generator may have a power line to the van, thus resulting in an effective loop
antenna or collector.

           (4)    Laying cables on the ground or shallow burial of cables for physical
protection is recommended when practical for EMP mitigation purposes. Cables strung in
the air can pick up more EMP energy than cables on the earth’s surface. Only very deeply
buried cables (10 feet or more) have significant EMP protection, but they are often not
worth the construction effort.

     f.   Dispersed operations, to include the use of remotes, increase survivability by
reducing a unit’s single-point signatures and increasing the number of targets an enemy
must find and engage.

      g.    Mitigation measures also include procedures for damage assessment, repair, and
testing of equipment. In a unit that has been subjected to EMP effects, electronic
equipment may be functionally damaged, operationally upset, or unaffected, depending on
the shielding and effectiveness of EMP mitigation postures.

          (1) Even though electronic equipment has suffered functional damage from
EMP, repairs may include operator maintenance procedures such as resetting circuit
breakers or replacing fuses.

           (2) Mission-critical computers can also be affected by EMP at levels that are
far lower than the intensities required to inflict functional damage. The effects may only be
revealed when it becomes evident that critical information is incorrect or unavailable. An
effective practice would be to assume that the computer memory has been upset and have
the operators automatically reload backup files.

           (3) Consistent with command priorities, all electronic equipment should be
tested and inspected for operational upset and/or functional damage. This includes items
that have been shielded or hardened against EMP effects. In some cases, upset or
functional damage may not be immediately evident.
