SUBJECT: Air Force Guidance Memorandum to AFI 91-111, Safety Rules for US Strategic
Bomber Aircraft

      By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this is an Air Force Guidance Memorandum
    immediately implementing changes to AFI 91-111, Safety Rules for US Strategic Bomber
    Aircraft. Compliance with this Memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its direction is
    inconsistent with other Air Force publications, the information herein prevails, in accordance
    with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.

    Add the following paragraphs:

       5.7. Unimpeded fragment throw between conventional general purpose bombs and
       nuclear weapons is a significant concern.
       5.7.1. Ensure a minimum unimpeded line-of-sight (See AFMAN91-201 Para.
       12.21.1.1.1) separation distance of 850 feet between nuclear weapons and conventional
       general purpose bombs. Munitions in transit are exempt. If a separation of 850 feet
       cannot be maintained, place significant barricades (such as Massive Modular Blocks)
       to prevent free-field fragment impact to nuclear weapon(s) and ensure fragment
       velocities are below weapon threshold levels as defined by Air Force Safety Center.

      This memorandum becomes void after one-year has elapsed from the date of this
    memorandum, or upon publication of an Interim Change or rewrite of the affected publication,
    whichever is earlier.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Clarified verbiage to ensure differentiation between nuclear and non-nuclear munitions. Clarified
the status of strategic bomber aircraft to a critical component when operationally coded
components are installed (paragraph 10). Moved instructions regarding ground operations from
paragraph 15 to paragraph 17 for consistency. Clarified procedures for Command Disable during
flying operations involving carriage of nuclear weapons in a strike configuration. Administrative
changes for ease of reading and clarification. Updated applicable references.

Section A—Authority, Limitations, and Responsibilities

1. Secretary of Defense Direction: The Secretary of Defense has directed the Secretary of the
Air Force to implement the rules.
2. Temporary Limitations. The Air Force may impose restrictions that are more strict than
those contained in safety rules, but may not unilaterally change the safety rules.
3. Functional Responsibilities.
     3.1. The Commander, Air Force Safety Center:
        3.1.1. Ensures that the safety rules work, providing maximum safety consistent with
        operational requirements.
        3.1.2. Ensures that units follow the safety rules
     3.2. Using Major Commands (MAJCOM):
        3.2.1. Ensure that their units follow the safety rules.
        3.2.2. Ensure that all safety standards and procedures agree with the approved safety
        rules.
        3.2.3. Inspect for compliance.
     3.3. Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) ensures that its manuals, checklists, and
     technical orders do not conflict with the safety rules.

Section B—Safety Rules

4. General Guidance. Per DoD 3150.2-M, DoD Nuclear Weapon System Safety Program
Manual, general safety rules apply to all nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon systems. General
safety rules primarily apply safety policy and shall be included as part of the Air Force's safety
rules package. Safety rules always apply, even during war.
     4.1. Nuclear weapons shall not be intentionally exposed to abnormal environments except in
     an emergency.
     4.2. Nuclear weapons shall not be used for training or for troubleshooting (i.e., to confirm
     the existence of a fault, aid in fault isolation, or verify that a fault has been corrected except
     as explicitly allowed by a specific safety rule.)
     4.3. Nuclear weapons may be used for exercises except when explicitly prohibited by
     specific safety rules.
AFI91-111 26 October 2011                                                                             3


   4.4. Only certified procedures, personnel, equipment, facilities, and organizations,
   authorized by the appropriate level of authority, shall be employed to conduct nuclear
   weapon system operations.
   4.5. The total number of personnel performing nuclear weapon system operations shall be
   held to the minimum consistent with the operations performed.
   4.6. At least two authorized persons must be present during any operation with a nuclear
   weapon, except when authorized by a specific safety rule; i.e., alert fly. They must be able to
   detect incorrect or unauthorized procedures in the task being performed. They must also have
   knowledge of and understand applicable safety and security requirements.
   4.7. Personnel that have physical access to nuclear weapons must be qualified under the
   PRP, in accordance with DoD Instruction 5210.42, Nuclear Weapon Personnel Reliability
   Program (PRP).
   4.8. Physical security will be maintained, in accordance with DoD Directive S-5210.41,
   Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons.
   4.9. Nuclear weapons will be transported as determined by the Combatant Commander or
   the Military Department, in accordance with DoD Instruction 4540.05, Logistic
   Transportation of Nuclear Weapons. Additionally, the following safety guidance applies:
       4.9.1. Movement(s) will be kept to a minimum consistent with operational requirements.
       4.9.2. Custody and accountability transfers during logistic movements shall be by courier
       receipt system to ensure positive control.
   4.10. Permissive Action Link (PAL) operations shall be in accordance with plans and
   procedures prescribed by the applicable Combatant Command and technical publications.
   4.11. Verification that a nuclear warhead is not present in a test assembly must be made
   utilizing nonnuclear assurance procedures at the last practical opportunity agreed upon by the
   Department of Defense and/or DOE before the conduct of an operational test.
   4.12. Deviations from safety rules are permitted in an emergency, except as follows:
       4.12.1. Nuclear weapons shall not be expended unless a valid, properly authenticated
       nuclear control order conveying release or expenditure authority is received. U.S. custody
       must be maintained until receipt of a valid nuclear control order that permits transferring
       U.S. nuclear weapons to non-U.S. delivery forces.
       4.12.2. Jettisoning of nuclear weapons is permitted in the event of an emergency, and is
       to be accomplished according to plans and procedures prescribed for the area of
       operations.
NOTE: DoD Directive 3150.2, DoD Nuclear Weapon System Safety Program, defines an
emergency as "an unexpected occurrence or set of circumstances in which personnel or
equipment unavailability, due to accident, natural event, or combat, may demand immediate
action that may require extraordinary measures to protect, handle, service, transport, jettison, or
employ a nuclear weapon."

5. Specific Guidance.
 4                                                                AFI91-111 26 October 2011

     6.2. Ensure procedures are implemented to clearly differentiate AGM-86B missile(s) that
     have a nuclear warhead installed from those that do not.
     6.3. Ensure procedures are implemented to clearly differentiate a warhead shipping and
     storage container that has a nuclear warhead from one that does not.
7. Nonnuclear Assurance. Verification that a nuclear warhead is not present in a test assembly
must be made using nonnuclear assurance procedures at the last practical opportunity agreed on
by the DoD and/or DOE before an operational test. This applies to test assemblies which:
