                                        SCHEDULING

6.1. Scheduling Practices. Adherence to safe operating procedures is mandatory and has prime
consideration in the planning, scheduling, briefing, and conduct of all activities. Development of
a comprehensive scheduling plan to manage personnel resources is critical for efficient
operations.
6.2. Alcohol Consumption. TF personnel are prohibited from consuming alcoholic beverages
12 hours prior to the pre-departure briefing for their alert duty.
   6.2.1. Possessing or consuming alcoholic beverages is prohibited within the confines of any
   MAF or LF.
6.3. Crew Rest. The purpose of crew rest is to ensure the crew member is adequately rested
before performing alert duties. Crew rest is free time, which includes time for meals,
transportation and sleep.
   6.3.1. Crew rest is mandatory prior to alert duties. MCCs must be given the opportunity for
   12 hours of crew rest immediately prior to the pre-departure briefing time.
6.4. Alert Construct and Requirements. MAF 01A is manned 24 hours a day from start-up to
execution.
   6.4.1. The MCCC is responsible for the crew and all alert related duties at the
   commencement of the pre-departure briefing until all materials are transferred to the
   appropriate agencies upon return to Building 6601.
   6.4.2. An alert period starts when the MCC assumes command of the flight area and ends
   when they are relieved by another crew.
   6.4.3. Only Combat Mission Ready (CMR) certified crews consisting of at least one MCCC,
   will perform alert duty at an operational LCC. Crew members becoming CMR restricted at
   their home units will not have an impact on their ability to perform alert duties in support of
   operational test launches.
       6.4.3.1. MCCCs and DMCCCs are normally paired together to form a crew; however,
       two certified MCCCs may be paired together to form a dual qualified CMR crew.
       6.4.3.2. 576 FLTS operators manning an LCC for test purposes will be mission certified
       in accordance with AFGSCI 13-5301v1, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) and
       Weapon System Testing Personnel Training.
6.5. Alert Credit. Duty shifts will not count towards an MCCs CMR alert currency
requirements.
6.6. Alert Rotation. MCCs can expect to see a routine schedule rotation to allow for time off
and crew rest requirements.
