       What to do During a Tornadoâ€¦
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the event of a tornado for building 1700 take shelter in the
stairwells or the downstairs conference room as the primary
area and the first floor restrooms as the secondary shelter
area. For shelter in the conference room go to the center of
the room away from the corners, doors, and outside walls.
Put as many walls as possible between you and the outside.
Get under a sturdy table and use your arms to protect your
head and neck. Do not open windows.
