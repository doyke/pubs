     property managers, and the capital asset management element (CEACH), based on demand
     and need.
     1.2. The RPP consists of two options, the RPP below Market and the RPP Plus from which
     selected property managers/landlords will choose to list their rental properties.
        1.2.1. The RPP below Market option offers rent at a reduced rate and basic cable by
        exception. With this option, utilities are paid separately unless otherwise stated in the
        memorandum of understanding (MOU).
        1.2.2. The RPP Plus option includes utilities with a maximum usage cap, and basic cable
        by exception.
     1.3. Fees such as background or credit checks will not be charged to qualified members who
     apply for tenancy in participating rental properties. There will be no out-of pocket move-in
     expenses such as deposits for security, cleaning, or damages assessed to tenants. Some rental

   units may have free storage and others may charge an additional fee. Additional fees will be
   at market rates.
   1.4. Rental payments will be made by means of military allotments through the CEACH
   Office to start, change and stop transactions.
   1.5. The Alaska Landlord Tenant Act (ALTA) and the MOU between each property and
   CEACH office will govern the RPP.
   1.6. The RPP will be made available to local rental properties who successfully meet the
   selection process guidelines.
   1.7. The CEACH office will not assume or be held liable in any manner for damages or
   monetary obligations incurred by participating tenants. As such the government will not
   reimburse the property managers/landlords in any way.
2. Eligibility:
   2.1. To be eligible members must be active duty, currently assigned to JBER, have at least
   one year remaining on the assignment and must initiate an allotment through the finance
   office for landlord payment. Members with less than one year remaining on their assignment
   may be eligible in the RPP on a case-by-case basis only if agreed upon by property
   managers/landlords. CEACH representatives validate member eligibility for the RPP
   program.
   2.2. Unaccompanied personnel, Air Force E4 and below, with less than 3 years in the
   service, or Army E5 and below must provide an Exception to Policy letter authorizing them
   to reside off-base to the CEACH office representative in order to qualify for the RPP
   program.
3. Applications/Leases/Allotments:
   3.1. Prior to entry into the RPP, eligible members must complete an RPP application (see
   Attachment 2, this instruction) containing member contact data, projected date estimated
   return overseas (DEROS), number of dependents/ roommates, and acceptance of the RPP
   terms.
   3.2. Members must visit the CEACH Office to apply for the RPP program. Members will be
   provided an RPP application that must be signed by both the member and the CEACH
   representative identifying all participating rental properties and allotment process
   responsibilities.
   3.3. Members may then begin the process of selecting a participating RPP rental property.
   The member must provide the selected property managers/landlords the RPP application to
   validate entitlement of the program to the landlord who will complete the appropriate section
   identified for their use. The lease must then be signed by both the member and the property
   manager/landlord. Under the RPP leases are established for one year. Leases for periods of
   less than one year may be accepted at the discretion of the property manager/landlord.
   3.4. Upon obtaining signatures, members are required to return both the application and
   signed and dated lease to the CEACH office so that allotment actions can be conducted. The
   CEACH Office will maintain a copy of the RPP application, signed lease, and allotment
   action on file until the lease is terminated.

        3.4.1. In the event that the lease is renewed a copy of the new lease must be provided to
        the CEACH Office to be placed on file. Changes to allotments will be adjusted to reflect
        the new lease amounts, as required.
        3.4.2. It’s the member’s responsibility to ensure the allotment action is successful and
        the property managers/landlords receive payment on time.
        3.4.3. Members must complete the required steps noted above regarding the “application
        procedures” in order to participate in the RPP program. If occupancy occurs prior to
        accomplishing the required application procedures the member will pay rent at the market
        rate to include all deposits and background search, and personal history fees.
     3.5. The tenant must provide copy of the allotment application and first month's rent
     (cashiers check or money order) to the property managers/landlords prior to occupancy.
4. Responsibilities:
     4.1. The CEACH Office is responsible for establishing guidelines, as well as monitoring,
     managing, and implementing the RPP program. This is accomplished by negotiating an
     MOU with each participating property manager/landlord. CEACH is responsible for
     reviewing rental prices and program options annually. CEACH will maintain a database of
     properties in the program that identifies individual properties, name of member, rank,
     apartment number, duty phone, price, move in date and DEROS.
        4.1.1. New Property Inspections. CEACH is responsible for ensuring properties being
        considered for selection into the RPP program be in good condition, modern, clean, and
        located in safe neighborhoods.
            4.1.1.1. Prospective property managers/landlords with multi-complexes must be able
            to provide at least five like rental units within a four-month period.
            4.1.1.2. RPP Rental Property Acceptance Inspection Process:
               4.1.1.2.1. Once a rental property meets the basic requirements an inspection team
               comprised of between three to eight members (company grade officers, first
               sergeants, noncommissioned officers, and a housing representative) is assigned to
               evaluate selection for final approval into the RPP.
               4.1.1.2.2. The inspection team is assembled and schedules the task of completing
               an RPP Property Inspection Checklist (see Attachment 3, this instruction)
               evaluation. Determinations of the inspection are forwarded to the rental property
               managers/landlords. If the property fails the selection process the property
               managers/landlords must correct deficiencies before another inspection is
               rescheduled. If the property is selected a CEACH representative will review RPP
               policies and procedures and negotiate with the property managers/landlords to set
               rental rates and obtain an MOU. A company code is then obtained from the
               military finance office to allow for expedient processing of allotment actions.
               4.1.1.2.3. Rental inspections may be conducted by CEACH office representatives
               as frequently as necessary to ensure that standards are being maintained using the
               facility inspection checklist (see Attachment 4, this instruction).
673ABWI32-6007 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                                   5


       4.1.2. RPP Property Listings. CEACH is responsible for maintaining RPP property
       listings containing current participating rental properties, options offered, contact phone
       numbers, addresses, and an area map identifying rental locations that will be made
       available for member reference at the CEACH storefront offices.
   4.2. Members are responsible for abiding by terms of the RPP agreement. It’s the member’s
   responsibility to ensure their rent is paid in full, their apartment is cleaned and cleared, and
   their allotment is stopped at the end of the lease agreement.
       4.2.1. Failure to abide by the terms of the RPP agreement may result in suspension or
       revocation of eligibility to participate in the program.
       4.2.2. Members that are issued a notice to vacate from property managers/landlords are
       responsible for notifying the CEACH Office IMMEDIATELY, and will no longer be
       eligible to participate in the RPP.
   4.3. Property managers/landlords are responsible for acquiring a new RPP MOU (see
   Attachment 5, this instruction) with the CEACH Office annually as a requirement to remain
   in the RPP.
5. Complaints Resolution:
   5.1. In the case of a grievance tenants should first attempt to contact their property
   managers/landlords to resolve their differences. In the event that a resolution cannot be
   reached members should then contact the CEACH office for mediation. Complaints will be
   remedied in accordance with the Alaska Landlord Tenant Act (ALTA) and must be
   submitted formally, in writing, before review by the CEACH Office. If the complaint is
   found to be valid a copy will be forwarded to property managers/landlords as the
   circumstances dictate. If a resolution is still not reached then legal assistance is advised.
   5.2. Valid complaints made against property managers/landlords are resolved within time
   limits outlined in the ALTA.
   5.3. All formal complaints will be maintained on file in the CEACH Office and reviewed
   prior to renewal of all annual MOU agreements.
6. Termination of a Property. Properties not conforming to or not maintained within the
CEAC housing standards will be removed from the RPP. Prior to removal, the property
manager/landlord will be provided written notice of the deficiencies and a 30-day opportunity to
cure the deficiencies. Properties may also be terminated by either party upon 90 days written
notice to the other party.
7. Termination of a Lease:
   7.1. Notice of Lease Termination. Members must provide property managers/landlords a
   written notice to terminate tenancy at least 30 days (one full rental month) prior to the rental
   due date. To cancel an allotment, the member must provide CEAC a copy of the notice to
   terminate signed by the property manager/landlord indicating the final move out status. If
   termination is due to permanent change of station (PCS), deployment or temporary duty
   (TDY) assignment the member must provide a copy of orders to the landlord as validation.
   7.2. Termination of Lease Due to Military Orders. Under the Service members Civil
   Relief Act the rent liability for members receiving PCS, separation/retirement orders, or TDY
6                                                       673ABWI32-6007 10 OCTOBER 2012


    orders in excess of 3 months may not exceed 30 days from the next rent due date providing
    the member gave property managers/landlords a written 30-day notice to terminate to the
    property along with a copy of the military orders. In many circumstances military orders are
    not made available to the member until several days prior to the date of departure. If a
    member has not yet been issued official orders but has received notice of pending PCS,
    separation/retirement, or TDY orders they may choose to provide property
    managers/landlords a written 30-day notice of termination from the next rental due date prior
    to the pending departure. The member is, however then obligated to the date provided on the
    notice to terminate. Any notice to terminate in advance of the final date on the lease
    agreement requires the tenant be responsible under the terms of their agreement until that
    date unless the unit is reoccupied.           In accordance with the ALTA, property
    managers/landlords must refund any remaining rent to the tenant within 14 days from the
    date the unit is reoccupied.
    7.3. Prefinal Inspection. It’s highly recommended that the member request a walk through
    inspection prior to the actual final date in order to assess any damages that may exist.
    7.4. Rental Cleaning. Members are responsible for cleaning the rental, returning the keys
    and garage door openers, and ensuring all rental payment obligations are paid in full. The
    rental must be returned to the property manager/landlord in the same degree of cleanliness in
    which it was received minus normal wear and tear. Carpet and walls must be cleaned in
    accordance with the ALTA. Charges may not be accessed by the lessor for normal non-
    abusive living. Members may be held responsible for any found conditions resulting from
    accident, neglect, or abuse which require repairs or treatments such as, but not limited to
    enzyme, damage to subfloor, or carpet replacement.
    7.5. Fees, Charges, and Payments. Under the ALTA, property managers/landlords must
    return any deposits (including pet deposits) and/or over paid rent to the member (less
    deduction for damages and cleaning) within 14 days of the move-out date. When property
    managers/landlords assess member damages they must provide the member a written list of
    damages and charges within 14 days from the move-out date. Unless members protest the
    charges, the member is required to reimburse the landlord for these charges within seven
    days of notification. If there is substantial damage, it is recommended that the
    landlord/property manager notify CEACH immediately. When members fail to stop
    allotments or their accounts are overpaid it is the property managers/landlords responsibility
    to reimburse the member. Property managers/ landlords are required to contact members and
    return the overpayment back to them. If the member failed to stop the allotment property
    managers/landlords should attempt to make contact with the member and return the funds. If
    property managers/landlords cannot contact the member or the member has failed to stop the
    allotment after being notified that the allotment is still active they need to send the funds
    back to the appropriate finance office and notify CEACH. This will not only return funds to
    members but it will also stop their allotment.
    7.6. Lease Options upon Expiration. In accordance with the ALTA leases will be month-
    to-month after the 12-month lease expires; however, property managers/landlords may
    require members to sign a new lease at that time. If members decide not to renew their lease,
    a 30-day notice is required to terminate the conditions of the existing lease obligation. Any
    new leases will be based on the current RPP MOU. If members renew an existing lease
673ABWI32-6007 10 OCTOBER 2012                                                                   7


   agreement they must provide a copy of the new agreement to CEACH and process a change
   allotment action at that time if there are any changes to the monthly rent amount.
8. Breaking a Lease. Members breaking a lease are subject to provisions of the ALTA.
Members are liable for the rent from the date of lease breaking until the rental unit is re-rented,
or until the terms of the lease are fulfilled as well as any damages that may have been incurred.
Damages may include advertising, physical damages and/or cleaning. Some property
managers/landlords may permit a buyout.
9. Eviction. Abuse of the RPP or failure to abide by the terms of the lease may result in
suspension or revocation of eligibility to participate in the program and possible eviction from
the property. Members issued a notice to vacate will be immediately suspended from
participating in the RPP. If eviction actions are taken the CEACH Office must be notified
IMMEDIATELY.
10. Information Collections. No information collections are required by this publication.

                  RENTAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM APPLICATION

Figure A2.1. Rental Partnership Program Application JBER
1. General. Under this program the initial lease will be for a period of 12 months unless
otherwise agreed upon by both parties in writing. Failure to abide by the Rental Partnership
Program rules may result in suspension or revocation of eligibility. While under this program
the Alaska Landlord and Tenant Act (ALTA) provisions still applies.
2. Allotment. Initiating an allotment for landlord payment is a perquisite for eligibility under
this program. As a condition for waiver of the security deposit and other benefits, the member
must execute an allotment through the Capital Asset Management Office so that the rental
payments are made directly to the landlord. Failure to initiate an allotment prior to move-in will
result in conversion to non Rental Partnership Program status. As such, market price rates,
deposits, and utilities will be incurred and costs will become the responsibility of the member.
3. Pre-Allotment Rental Payment. Any rent due prior to successful receipt of payroll
allotment to the property manager/landlord will be the responsibility of the member. Any such
payment(s) will be made directly to the property manager/landlord by certified funds (money
order or cashier's check).
4. Termination. Member must provide the landlord a written notice to terminate tenancy at
least 30 days (one full rental month) prior to the rental due date. To cancel an allotment the
member must provide the Capital Asset Management Office a copy of the notice to terminate
signed by the landlord indicating the final move out date. If termination is due to PCS,
deployment or TDY assignment the member must provide a copy of orders to the landlord as
validation. Upon termination member is responsible for any and all outstanding bills.
5. Damages. Damages beyond normal wear and tear must be paid to the property
manager/landlord within 7 days after receiving the itemized bill.
6. Military Clause. In the event that the military member receives PCS, separation, retirement,
or TDY orders of 90 days or more, the lease may be terminated with a copy of the orders and a
written 30-day notice of termination.
