  Activities. HHQ stan/eval staff members may coordinate directly with the unit for informal
  visits.
  2.5.2. (Added-AETC) Formal Inspections. Formal visits ensure subordinate units are in
  compliance with HHQ guidance and Air Force Instructions. The NAF/DO(A3) or his or her
  designated representative will function as the stan/eval chief for all formal inspections and
  will coordinate with the OG/CC for all flying by the HHQ stan/eval staff aircrew members.
  See Attachment 8 (Added) of this supplement for information on formal visits, which are
  designated as aircrew stan/eval visits (ASEV).
     2.5.2.1. (Added-AETC) SAVs. When requested by the unit or at the discretion of the
     NAF/CC, NAFs will provide SAVs to units during off years of the Aircrew Stan/Eval
     visit (ASEV). Normally, SAVs are conducted to solve specific problems or exchange
     information, but may cover any operational area the unit desires. SAVs are not a pre-
     inspection inspection and normally are not conducted within the 6 months prior to a
     formal stan/eval inspection.
     2.5.2.2. (Added-AETC) Aircrew Stan/Eval Visits (ASEV). An ASEV is a formal
     visit to inspect instructor qualification and training and stan/eval programs. See
     Attachment 8 (Added) of this supplement for information on ASEVs. The appropriate
     NAF/DO(A3) is the waiver authority for the ASEV program.
  2.5.3. (Added-AETC) Informal Visits. The purpose of informal visits is to maintain
  aircraft currency and provide feedback and crosstalk to the units. HHQ stan/eval flight
  examiners (SEFE) may perform instructor or evaluator duties (if qualified) during these
  visits. NAF SEFEs may perform evaluator duties on permanent party or formal training unit
  (FTU) students and instructors. On request, in-brief and out-brief the OG/CC, SQ/CC, or
  squadron operations officer (SQ/DO).

                UNIT STAN/EVAL FUNCTIONS AND ORGANIZATION

3.1. Scope. For purposes of this instruction, "unit" includes levels of organization under HHQs
required to establish a Stan/Eval function. Most units are composed of an Operations Group
(OG) and flying squadrons/detachments (henceforth in this AFI, "squadron" will be used
synonymously with "detachment"). Where there is no parent OG, squadrons will assume duties
listed for OGs.
3.2. Operations Group. The conduct of the unit level Stan/Eval program is directed by the
OG/CC.
   3.2.1. OG/CC Responsibilities.
       3.2.1.1. Provide manpower to the unit Stan/Eval function to execute the duties directed
       by this AFI.
       3.2.1.2. Designate OG Stan/Eval (OGV) flight examiners (see paragraph 4.2.3).
       3.2.1.3. Provide the means to procure the necessary materials for mission planning, pre-
       flight briefings, and flying supervision.
       3.2.1.4. Provide a suitable Stan/Eval testing area.
       3.2.1.5. Direct supplementary evaluations (see Chapter 9).
       3.2.1.6. Chair the SEB.
       3.2.1.7. Establish procedures to implement MAJCOM-mandated Stan/Eval software.
   3.2.2. OGV Functions.
       3.2.2.1. At the OGV level, emphasis is on overall unit standardization. Under direction
       of the Chief of OGV, flight examiners will ensure standardization among squadron
       Stan/Eval functions and squadron-assigned flight examiners.
       3.2.2.2. Establish procedures for review and quality control of AF Forms 8, Certificate of
       Aircrew Qualification, and (if applicable) AF Forms 8a, Certificate of Aircrew
       Qualification (Multiple Aircraft).
       3.2.2.2. (COLUMBUSAFB) Each squadron DOV will implement a routing system for
       AF Forms 8, ensuring that all are routed through 14 OG/OGV to be reviewed for quality
       control purposes before being finalized.
       3.2.2.3. Establish procedures to maintain and review unit Flight Evaluation Folders
       (FEFs). If not maintained by the squadron Stan/Eval function, maintain unit FEFs.
       3.2.2.3. (COLUMBUSAFB) Squadrons will accomplish an initial review of the flight
       evaluation folder (FEF) for newly assigned aircrew and an annual review every 12
       months. Each squadron DOV will maintain FEFs in a locked cabinet and IAW AFI11-
       202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, Chapter 7.
       3.2.2.4. Establish procedures for requisite Aircrew Exams (see Chapter 6).
       3.2.2.4. (COLUMBUSAFB) See Chapter 6.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012                                            17


     3.2.2.5. Establish and maintain a trend program.
     3.2.2.5. (COLUMBUSAFB) Each squadron will track missed questions on all
     evaluation requisite and periodic tests. Trends will be identified when any question is
     missed by three or more individuals per quarter or on 15% of the tests taken whichever is
     greater. A trend area will also be identified when the total questions missed from any
     specific subject area (i.e. filing requirements, holding procedures, fuel planning,
     departure procedures, particular aircraft system, local area procedures, etc—squadron
     DOV discretion) exceeds 15% of the total questions missed during the quarter. OGV will
     manage the trend program. The respective squadron DOV function will act as the office
     of primary responsibility (OPR) for all stan/eval board (SEB) identified trends. Office of
     collateral responsibility (OCR) for SEB identified trends is 14 OG/OGV. For flight and
     ground evaluation trends, downgrade items will be considered a trend when an item
     occurs three times or on 15% of total like evaluations in one quarter, whichever is higher
     (a like evaluation is one in which a specific downgrade can occur). Emergency
     procedures and general knowledge areas will be grouped as one downgrade item for
     trending purposes.
        3.2.2.5.1. Scope will include trend analysis of all evaluations.
        3.2.2.5.2. For units with more than one type of MDS and/or crew positions, combine
        discrepancies common to all MDSs/crew positions to determine trends (e.g.,
        instrument procedures).
        3.2.2.5.3. For Formal Training Units (FTUs) and Combat Crew Training Squadrons
        (CCTSs), maintain separate trend data for students and instructors.
        3.2.2.5.4. When trends are noted, recommend corrective action and assign an
        OPR/Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR).
        3.2.2.5.5. Report trends and status to the OG/CC during the SEB until closed (see
        Attachment 2). Maintain an archive of trend data for at least one year from the date
        the trend was identified.
     3.2.2.6. Conduct supplementary evaluations as directed by the OG/CC.
     3.2.2.7. Conduct SEBs and document IAW Attachment 2 and MAJCOM supplement.
     3.2.2.7. (AETC) Conduct stan/eval boards (SEB) as follows:
     3.2.2.7. (COLUMBUSAFB) OGV is responsible for developing, scheduling, and
     convening the SEB. OGV will maintain a close liaison with the air traffic control chief
     of standardization and evaluation (ATC S/E) and CSI. ATC S/E and CSI will provide
     OGV with all required evaluation results and data as requested for the SEB.
        3.2.2.7.1. (Added-AETC) At a minimum, conduct SEBs semiannually on a fiscal
        year basis. AFRC units will forward SEB data for assigned aircrews on a calendar
        year basis. Compile SEB data for students on a fiscal year basis.
        3.2.2.7.2. (Added-AETC) In addition to the OG/CC, other members of the SEB
        include all OGV SEFEs, SQ/CCs, DOs, squadron and attached SEFEs, and a
        simulator instructor (SI) if available. Additional members may be designated in a unit
        supplement.

   evaluate those mission/skill sets in which they maintain qualification and/or certification.
   EXCEPTION: SPOT evaluations and where specifically authorized in AFI11-2MDS, Vol 2.
      4.3.3.1. Waiver authority for flight examiners to evaluate mission/skill sets in which they
      are not certified is the OG/CC. For senior flight examiners (see paragraph 4.4), waiver
      authority is the next commander in their flying chain of command
   4.3.4. Will not administer evaluations outside of their MAJCOM unless specifically
   requested by the MAJCOM Stan/Eval organization of the examinee and approved by the
   MAJCOM Stan/Eval organization of the examiner. MAJCOMs may establish procedures in
   their supplement for flight examiners to administer evaluations outside of NAFs/units within
   their own MAJCOM (see also paragraph 2.3.5).
   4.3.4. (AETC) SEFEs may give evaluations outside their squadron (within the same group)
   with the concurrence of both SQ/CCs. Evaluations conducted outside the group require
   concurrence of the OG/CCs or their equivalents.
   4.3.5. Conduct a thorough pre-mission briefing and post-mission debriefing for the examinee
   and applicable aircrew members on all aspects of the evaluation.
   4.3.5. (COLUMBUSAFB) FEs should reference Attachment 13 for briefing and debriefing

   any remarks, restrictions, or recommendations to be entered on the AF Form 8, Certificate of
   Aircrew Qualification.
   4.3.7. As soon as possible, notify the examinee’s squadron commander (or available
   supervision if the squadron commander cannot be reached) whenever Qualification Level 2
   or 3 (Q2 or Q3) performance is observed (see paragraph 5.3.3).
   4.3.7. (COLUMBUSAFB) FEs will notify SQ/CC or SQ/DO and 14 OG/OGV of all Q-
   2/Q-3 performance prior to the debrief. SQ/CC or designated representative will attend the
   debrief. SQ/CC or 14 OG/OGV will notify OG/CC.
   4.3.8. (Added-AETC) Use a pyramid evaluation system for all periodic evaluations (not
   required for evaluations required by a formal course of training), which requires higher

    echelon SEFEs to administer evaluations to lower echelon SEFEs and disallows any SEFE
    from evaluating his or her rater (See Table 4.1. [Added]). In addition:
       4.3.8.1. (Added-AETC) If there is no representation for a specific aircrew position at
       the NAF, the next lower echelon SEFE becomes the top of the pyramid, no waiver is
       required. Individuals at the top of the pyramid may be evaluated by any certified SEFE.
       4.3.8.2. (Added-AETC) Additional duty flight examiners will not administer
       evaluations to other flight examiners. An additional duty flight examiner is defined as one
       who is not occupying the following positions: SQ/CC, DO, and DOV; OG/CC, CD and
       OGV; WG/CC; and NAF and (or) MAJCOM stan/eval (or equivalent). Exception:
       Individuals at the top of the pyramid may be evaluated by any certified SEFE.
       4.3.8.3. (Added-AETC) When a pyramid evaluation is not practical, request a waiver
       from the 19 AF/DO. Document the waiver in the comments section of the individual’s
       AF Form 8.
       4.3.8.4. (Added-AETC) The pyramid evaluation system does not apply to the EPE or
       the rear cockpit pilot (RCP) evaluation.
       4.3.8.5. (Added-AETC) At Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola, the government flight
       representative is an OGV equivalent.
       4.3.8.6. (Added-AETC) SEFEs augmenting HHQ inspection teams are considered NAF
       or HHQ equivalent for AF Form 8 routing purposes.
       4.3.8.7. (Added-AETC) Normally, SEFEs will not evaluate personnel they have
       recommended for upgrade or primarily instructed during the final phase of training.
       4.3.8.8. (Added-AETC) The 19th AF/DO is the final approving officer for all AF
       Forms 8 completed for the two FTG/CCs and the TRG/CC who report directly to 19
       AF/CC.
       4.3.8.9. (Added-AETC) For cases not specifically addressed, use row 17 or 18, or use
       the routing most consistent with the pattern established above. The intent is always for
       the final approving officer to be the examinee's rater, or the next appropriate individual in
       the examinee's chain-of-command. Request clarification from 19AF/DO as necessary.
       4.3.8.10. (Added-AETC) Items having more than one row (e.g., Item 2, SQ Assigned)
       indicate different alternatives or options for a given examinee.

                      AIRCREW QUALIFICATION EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Aircrew Stan/Eval Program utilizes aircrew qualification evaluations to
ensure qualification of aircrew members and supplementary evaluations to ensure
standardization of operations.
   5.1.1. To promote efficient use of flying resources, accomplish aircrew qualification
   evaluations concurrently, whenever practical.
   5.1.2. Evaluations in multiple crew positions will be addressed in MAJCOM supplements.
   For specialized aircrew, see Chapter 8. For guidance on supplementary evaluations, see
   Chapter 9.
   5.1.2. (AETC) Examinees will not be evaluated in multiple crew positions.
5.2. Categories. Aircrew qualification evaluations are divided into five categories
(Qualification (QUAL), Instrument (INSTM), Mission (MSN), Instructor (INSTR), and SPOT)
each consisting of two structured phases, ground and flight. (EXCEPTION: SPOT evaluations
may consist of either a ground or flight phase.) Each phase requires the completion of requisite
tasks (see paragraph 5.5). (EXCEPTION: a SPOT evaluation has no requisite tasks.)
   5.2.1. QUAL Evaluations.
       5.2.1.1. Purpose. Ensure basic qualification in an MDS and/or crew position.
       5.2.1.2. Execution. All aircrew will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in their
       primary assigned aircraft/crew position as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS, Vol
       2. QUAL evaluations may be combined with INSTM and/or MSN evaluations IAW AFI
       11-2MDS, Vol 2. See Chapter 8 for specialized aircrew.
   5.2.2. INSTM Evaluations.
       5.2.2.1. Purpose. Obtain/maintain instrument qualification in order to operate under
       Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)
       5.2.2.2. Execution. All USAF pilots (and other pilots flying operationally with the
       USAF, e.g., exchange pilots) will obtain/maintain instrument qualification by
       successfully completing a periodic INSTM evaluation.
           5.2.2.2.1. EXCEPTION: Indoctrination flyers who fly under the provisions of AFI
           11-401, Aviation Management; USAF Test Pilot School students; TG-series aircraft
           pilots; T-41/51/52 pilots.
           5.2.2.2.2. Pilots assigned to excepted aircraft who may also be assigned to other
           aircraft that are not excepted will maintain instrument qualification, but will take their
           INSTM checkride in the non-excepted aircraft.
           5.2.2.2.3. A pilot with a revoked or expired instrument qualification will not fly
           under IFR except under supervised status in a training program leading to
           requalification. (Does not apply to pilots in excepted situations listed above.)
   5.2.3. MSN Evaluations.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012                                               27


     5.2.3.1. Purpose. To ensure qualification to employ the aircrew’s assigned weapon
     system/crew position in the accomplishment of the unit’s operational or Designated
     Operational Capability (DOC) statements mission(s).
     5.2.3.2. Execution. All aircrew members maintaining Mission Ready (MR)/Combat
     Mission Ready (CMR) or Basic Mission Capable (BMC) status (IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1,
     Aircrew Training) will complete a periodic MSN evaluation as specified in the applicable
     AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
     5.2.3.2. (AETC) Unless specifically waived in the MDS-specific volume 2, a MSN
     evaluation is required for all aircrew members maintaining Mission Ready (MR)/Combat
     Mission Ready (CMR) or Basic Mission Capable (BMC) status.
        5.2.3.2.1. EXCEPTION: The requirement for a MSN evaluation may be waived for
        those aircraft where performance of normal operational, test, and training sorties
        involves tasks covered during the accomplishment of an INSTM and/or QUAL
        evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Document waiver via memorandum
        for record (MFR) to be included in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2. HQ
        USAF/A3O-A approval is not required for such waivers. Specify approval
        procedures in MAJCOM supplements to this instruction or in the applicable AFI 11-
        2MDS Vol 2.
        5.2.3.2.2. The MSN evaluation should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required
        in fulfillment of the aircraft’s operational or DOC statement missions.
  5.2.4. INSTR Evaluations.
     5.2.4.1. Purpose. To qualify aircrew as instructors in their weapon system/crew position
     by focusing primarily on the examinees instructional ability.
     5.2.4.2. Execution. Aircrew members obtaining/regaining instructor qualification in a
     weapon system/crew position must complete evaluations of instructional capability in
     that weapon system/crew position. Guidance for specialized, universal, and/or multiple
     qualified aircrew will be specified in MAJCOM Supplements and/or AFI 11-2MDS Vol
     2. EXCEPTION: For units undergoing aircraft conversion, when a complement of
     current and qualified Air Force instructors does not exist to accomplish initial unit
     instructor qualification, with MAJCOM/A3 approval and Lead MAJCOM/A3
     coordination the OG/CC may establish an Initial cadre (minimum required for initial
     conversion) of flight instructors who do not require an INIT INSTR evaluation. Initial
     cadre must be current and qualified instructors in a US Air Force aircraft who will remain
     in the same crew position on the new aircraft. OG/CCs will notify MAJCOMs and
     provide initial cadre list for each crew position with current qualification and total flight
     and instructor hours. OG/CCs will use discretion when establishing initial cadre
     instructors and consider availability of suitable instructor courses. See also paragraph
     5.13.
     5.2.4.2. (AETC) Submit initial cadre requests to AETC/A2/3/10 through 19 AF/DO.
        5.2.4.2.1. Accomplish INIT INSTR evaluations on actual instructional missions
        whenever possible. When students are not available or mission/crew composition
28                       AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012


         requirements prevent inclusion of students, another crewmember or the evaluator will
         serve as the student.
         5.2.4.2.2. Evaluations of instructor qualification will be conducted during all
         subsequent periodic evaluations.
         5.2.4.2.3. Instructors who expire on their INSTM, QUAL, and/or MSN checkrides
         evaluations are not qualified to instruct in those areas (e.g. if an IP expires on his/her
         MSN zone, he/she may still instruct in INSTM/QUAL-related areas as specified in
         AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2).
  5.2.5. SPOT Evaluations –Flight or Ground (Optional).
     5.2.5.1. Purpose. Evaluate a specific event or requirement without intending to satisfy
     the requirements of a periodic evaluation and/or an initial INSTR evaluation.
     5.2.5.2. Execution. A SPOT has no specific requisites, unless specified in MAJCOM
     supplements, but may be No Notice IAW paragraph 5.2.6.3.
         5.2.5.2.1. An examinee may utilize a SPOT evaluation to update a
         QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the
         evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph 5.8 (document on
         the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5).
            5.2.5.2.1.1. OG/CCs may authorize additional flights in order to help the aircrew
            accomplish periodic requirements (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph
            7.3.7.3.5).
            5.2.5.2.1.2. When the flight examiner administering a SPOT evaluation is not
            qualified in the MDS (e.g. a Senior flight examiner), the evaluation will not be
            credited towards a periodic evaluation.
     5.2.5.3. Any qualifying event and/or evaluations not listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through
     5.2.4 will be documented as a SPOT evaluation.
  5.2.6. Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, when applicable, to further describe
  the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1 through 5.2.5:
     5.2.6.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type, to include instructor
     qualification, in a specific weapon system/crew position (e.g., INIT QUAL/INSTM, INIT
     MSN, INIT INSTR).
     5.2.6.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
     qualification due to:
         5.2.6.2.1. Expiration of a required periodic evaluation. The recheck will be IAW the
         guidance for that periodic evaluation.
         5.2.6.2.2. Loss of currency that requires a requal evaluation (IAW AFI11-2MDS Vol
         1). In this case RQ SPOT will be used for documentation (see paragraph 7.3.5.2.2).
         The recheck profile will be as directed by the SQ/CC and will include, as a minimum,
         those items for which the individual is non-current.
         5.2.6.2.3. A flight recheck following a failed periodic evaluation. The recheck will be
         IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.6.1.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012                                              29


        5.2.6.2.4. Loss of qualification due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
        paragraph 5.9). The recheck profile will be as directed by the commander on the AF
        Form 8/8a (see paragraph 7.4).
        5.2.6.2.5. The RQ prefix will not be used under the following circumstances:
            5.2.6.2.5.1. If the expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure to
            complete one or more of the ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.5.1), but the
            flight evaluation has successfully been completed within the eligibility period and
            the OG/CC determines that qualification will be re-established by completion of
            the ground requisites without re-accomplishment of the flight evaluation.
            5.2.6.2.5.2. To prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
            qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
     5.2.6.3. No-Notice (N/N).
     5.2.6.3. (AETC) NAF SEFEs will conduct no-notice evaluations as directed by the
     NAF/DO(A3). Each subsequent level of command (OG and SQ) will institute a no-
     notice, in-flight evaluation program. Specific program goals are at the discretion of the
     OG/CC and SQ/CC; however, to ensure the program is used effectively, the unit must use
     discretion in the selection of crewmembers and missions being evaluated. Distribute no-
     notice evaluations (quality of force) proportionately among aircrew positions, weapons
     systems, and type evaluation. Publish requirements for the local unit’s no-notice program
     in the unit supplement.
     5.2.6.3. (COLUMBUSAFB) OGV will submit an annual No-Notice (N/N) quality of
     force plan to the OG/CC for approval by 15 Jan. At a minimum, the OGV annual plan
     should include at least one N/N per quarter and a sample of each category of check ride.
     Squadrons will institute an N/N program separate from OGV and include the data for the
     SEB. Squadrons will provide OGV their N/N plan on an annual basis NLT 15 Jan and
     will update OGV as required.
        5.2.6.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of
        daily aircrew performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
        5.2.6.3.2. A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified of the
        evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. “Normal
        preparation” will be as defined in the MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        5.2.6.3.2. (COLUMBUSAFB) FEs will coordinate with SQ/CCs or SQ/DOs in
        advance before informing examinees of an N/N evaluation. For reserve associate
        N/N check rides, coordinate with reserve flight commander to ensure AFRC
        leadership is aware of the check ride. “Normal Preparation” is at the discretion of the
        SQ/CC, normally the day prior. Examinee will be notified by SQ/CC or designated
        representative.
     5.2.6.4. Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase requisite is conducted
     in a simulator and/or suitable ATD as defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
     5.2.6.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation
     (e.g., N/N SIM SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined
 30                       AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012


      evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes (if not obvious by the context of the
      evaluation) will be explained on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.
5.3. Grading System.
   5.3.1. A two step grading system is used to evaluate and document aircrew performance.
   5.3.1. (COLUMBUSAFB) As a guide, FEs will use COLUMBUSAFB Form 39, flight
   evaluation checklist, to document the emergency procedures evaluation (EPE) or check ride.
   Be specific about flap settings for traffic pattern stalls, the type of single-engine approach
   flown, and the key the emergency landing pattern (ELP) was flown from.
      5.3.1.1. In the first step, individual grades are assigned to each evaluation requisite to
      include the grading of areas/subareas of aircrew performance against established
      evaluation criteria (see paragraph 5.4). Performance less than fully qualified must be
      documented.
      5.3.1.2. In the second step, an overall qualification level is assigned based on a
      compilation of all individual requisite grades (see paragraph 5.3.3.4).
   5.3.2. Performance Areas/Subareas.
      5.3.2.1. Areas/subareas will have a two-tier (Q/U) or three-tier (Q/Q-/U) grading system.
      Discrepancies will be documented against the established areas/subareas.
          5.3.2.1.1. Q indicates the examinee demonstrated both a satisfactory knowledge of
          all required information and performed aircrew duties within the prescribed
          tolerances.
          5.3.2.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea
          tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight
          examiner. Deviations must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances, jeopardize flight
          safety, or be a breach of flight discipline.
          5.3.2.1.3. U indicates that performance was outside allowable parameters thereby
          compromising flight safety, that deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances
          adversely affected mission accomplishment, and/or evaluated performance
          constituted a breach of flight discipline. An examinee receiving an area/subarea grade
          of U requires debriefing and/or additional training, as determined by the flight
          examiner.
      5.3.2.2. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or U require remedial action that includes
      either debriefing discrepancies and/or assignment of additional training.
          5.3.2.2.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of
          the evaluation wherein the flight examiner provides instruction concerning the
          discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or
          proficiency.
          5.3.2.2.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by the flight examiner to
          remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
              5.3.2.2.2.1. May include self-study, ground instruction, use of a simulator/ATD
              or flying.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012                                              31


             5.3.2.2.2.2. Will be complete by the last day of the third month following the date
             of the discrepancy (e.g., for an evaluation on 21 Jan 12, additional training must
             be accomplished by 30 Apr 12).
             5.3.2.2.2.2. (AETC) For students enrolled in an AETC syllabus, enter a date not
             to exceed the last day of the second month following the event requiring
             additional training (for example, 26 Jan 06, Flight Evaluation 31 Mar 06, due
             date).
             5.3.2.2.2.3. If an aircrew member exceeds the allotted time for completion of
             additional training, the SQ/CC will review the situation and direct appropriate
             action. Document the circumstances with an MFR to be included in the AF Form
             8/8a (see paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
             5.3.2.2.2.4. Document additional training on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs
             7.3.5.6 and 7.3.7.3.4.
     5.3.2.3. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as “required” in the
     general and specific evaluation sections of the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
     5.3.2.4. In addition to required areas/subareas, the flight examiner will grade any
     area/subarea observed during an evaluation if performance in that area/subarea impacts
     the specific evaluation accomplished or overall flight safety.
     5.3.2.5. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft conditions.
     5.3.2.6. Minor momentary deviations are acceptable, provided the examinee applies
     prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider
     cumulative deviations when determining the overall area/subarea grade.
     5.3.2.7. The flight examiner may further identify any area/sub-area as “Commendable”
     if, in the examiner’s determination, the aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional
     skill and knowledge. Document IAW paragraph 7.3.7.3.5.2.
     5.3.2.8. (Added-AETC) During senior officer initial and recurring evaluations leading
     to qualification to fly a mobility aircraft (for example, C-17, C-130, C-130J, KC-135, and
     C-21) in a supervised status, flight examiners will grade aircrew members on their ability
     to meet AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 performance standards while receiving verbal instruction.
  5.3.3. Qualification Levels. Qualification levels are assigned both to individual evaluations
  (i.e. flight evals and EPEs) as well as overall performance. Individual evaluations are graded
  as a compilation of all area/sub-area grades. Overall performance is graded as a compilation
  of all requisite tasks associated with the required evaluation. Both individual and overall
  grades are based on the following.
     5.3.3.1. Q1. The aircrew member demonstrated desired performance and knowledge of
     procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in the grading criteria.
     This will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted, but may be awarded when
     discrepancies are noted if:
         5.3.3.1.1. No U grades were awarded for any discrepancy area/sub-area.
         5.3.3.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies preclude
         awarding of an overall Q1.
32                       AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012


        5.3.3.1.3. All areas/sub-areas graded as Q- during the evaluation were cleared during
        the debrief of that evaluation.
     5.3.3.2. Q2. The aircrew member demonstrated the ability to perform duties safely, but:
        5.3.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training was
        assigned.
        5.3.3.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
        5.3.3.2.2. (AETC) When a non-critical area/subarea is graded U, serious
        consideration should be given to assigning an overall grade of Q-3. When two or
        more non-critical areas/subareas are graded U, the overall grade will be Q-3.
        5.3.3.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q2 may be given if there is
        justification based on Q- performance in one or several areas/subareas.
     5.3.3.3. Q3. The aircrew member demonstrated an unacceptable level of safety,
     performance or knowledge.
        5.3.3.3.1. Any critical area graded U requires an overall Q3 (applicable to both flight
        evaluations and EPEs).
        5.3.3.3.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, a Q3 may be given if there is
        justification based on Q-/U performance in one or several non-critical areas/subareas.
     5.3.3.4. Assigning the overall qualification level.
        5.3.3.4.1. The flight-phase flight examiner is the examiner responsible for assigning
        the overall qualification level.
        5.3.3.4.2. An overall grade of Q1 or Q2 will be given only after all evaluation
        requirements (to include requisite examinations) have been completed and given due
        consideration.
        5.3.3.4.3. An overall grade of Q3 may be awarded at any time.
        5.3.3.4.4. While AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may dictate the highest grade for a flight or
        EPE based on area and subarea performance, flight examiner judgment will
        always be the determining factor in deciding the overall grade.
     5.3.3.5. Exceptionally Qualified (EQ) Designation. An EQ may be given, but will
     only be applied to the overall grade - not to separate requisites. Document on the AF
     Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.2. An EQ may be given when:
     5.3.3.5. (COLUMBUSAFB) The exceptionally qualified (EQ) designation should be
     reserved for crewmembers whose performance far exceeds normal requirements.
     Consideration should be given to the complexity of the EPE, the profile, the ability to
     take advantage of situations arising throughout the sortie, and the skill level demonstrated
     by the crewmember's actions.
        5.3.3.5.1. The aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in
        all phases of the evaluation;
        5.3.3.5.2. The aircrew member has not failed any requisite and;
        5.3.3.5.3. The aircrew member received a Q on all areas/subareas evaluated.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012                                              33


5.4. Evaluation Criteria.
   5.4.1. Lead MAJCOMs, in coordination with the applicable user MAJCOMs, will establish
   and maintain standardized INSTM, MSN, QUAL, and INSTR evaluation criteria in the
   appropriate AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Lead MAJCOMs will coordinate with the program
   managers of any command-mandated software on any updates of eval criteria to aid in the
   expeditious revision of eval criteria files. Lead MAJCOMs are also responsible for
   coordinating the establishment of the following:
   5.4.1. (AETC) Contractors may use AETC Form 610Q, Contractor Instructor Evaluation
   Record, as an evaluation worksheet and to identify evaluation criteria.
       5.4.1.1. Areas/subareas including the identification of critical areas and those areas
       required for evaluation completion. These areas/subareas will be arranged into general
       and specific evaluation areas.
          5.4.1.1.1. Critical areas are those areas that, upon failure, would most adversely
          affect the qualification of an aircrew member. Critical areas will include, but are not
          limited to, Airmanship, Safety, and Flight Discipline.
       5.4.1.2. An area containing criteria for Publications Checks. This is required for QUAL
       evaluations and may be accomplished on other evaluations.
          5.4.1.2.1. Each aircrew member is responsible for maintaining required flight
          publications as outlined in applicable AFI11-2MDS volumes.
          5.4.1.2.2. Q performance requires individual flight publications be current and
          properly posted. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew
          members are still responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications
          required for the mission.
       5.4.1.3. An area containing criteria for Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM)
       IAW AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, and
       MAJCOM supplements (as applicable).
       5.4.1.4. Criteria to ensure operations comply with National Airspace System (NAS) rules
       and procedures or applicable Host Nation requirements for evaluations administered
       outside of the NAS.
5.5. Requisites. These include both ground and flight phase items. The ground phase, when
required, includes a series of examinations (see Chapter 6) as well as evaluation of aircrew
performance in a controlled emergency procedures environment (i.e. EPEs, see paragraph
5.5.1.2). The flight phase includes an in-flight and/or simulator evaluation of aircrew
performance.
   5.5.1. Ground Phase Requisites.
       5.5.1.1. Ground phase requisites for each evaluation include the following.
          5.5.1.1.1. QUAL: Open book examination, closed book examination,
          Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) examination / EPE (if applicable).
          5.5.1.1.2. INSTM: Instrument examination
          5.5.1.1.3. MSN: As specified in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
34                       AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012


     5.5.1.2. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPEs).
         5.5.1.2.1. Purpose. Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of MDS-Specific EPs
         and systems for all QUAL evaluations; evaluate mission-specific EPs and tactical
         systems knowledge during MSN evaluations.
         5.5.1.2.2. Execution. AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 will specify contents of EPEs, areas to be
         evaluated, grading criteria, and whether EPEs may be done in-flight, in a
         simulator/ATD, or verbally.
            5.5.1.2.2.1. Only one EPE needs to be accomplished for each combined
            evaluation (i.e., one EPE for a QUAL/MSN or INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluation).
            5.5.1.2.2.2. A single EPE may be used for separate evaluations (e.g. a MSN and
            INSTM/QUAL eval) as long as the combined EPE is of a scope and duration to
            cover required areas and is conducted within the requisite zone for each
            evaluation (see paragraph 5.8).
         5.5.1.2.3. Grading. Q1 performance for EPEs requires taking the proper action in
         the correct sequence, not a verbatim response. Each aircrew member is responsible
         for the Boldface/CAPs applicable to their crew position.
         5.5.1.2.4. Additional Training. For an EPE requiring additional training, the flight
         examiner will indicate if the additional training must be accomplished before the next
         unsupervised flight (see also paragraph 5.3.2.2.2). Document IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.6
         and 7.3.7.3.4.
         5.5.1.2.4. (AETC) All additional training items for an EPE must be completed
         before accomplishing the flight phase of the evaluation.
         5.5.1.2.5. Boldface/CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a Boldface/CAP
         situation during an EPE requires an EPE grade of 3 (unqualified). Under these
         circumstances, the examinee will not fly again until a successful reevaluation is
         accomplished (either written, verbally, or in a simulator/ATD as determined by the
         flight examiner)
         5.5.1.2.6. Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an EPE grade of 3
         (unqualified) will be placed on supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7.
  5.5.2. Flight Phase Requisites. The flight phase for aircrew evaluations include execution
  in the weapon system and/or a suitable simulator/ATD (unless restricted by AFI 11-2MDS
  Vol 2).
     5.5.2.1. The profile used to fulfill the flight phase requisite must incorporate all
     appropriate requirements set in the applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2, and allow accurate
     measure of the proficiency of the examinee.
     5.5.2.1. (AETC) If the lead command has not established specific criteria in the AFI 11-
     2MDS Vol 2, units will define specific evaluation criteria and areas in the unit
     supplement.
     5.5.2.2. Evaluation profiles will be realistic, reflect unit tasking, be consistent with daily
     training missions, and incorporate current tactics applicable to the unit mission.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012                                                 35


   5.5.3. Requisite Completion.
       5.5.3.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in
       the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the eligibility period of the
       current evaluation (see paragraph 5.8). The OG/CC may waive this requirement on a
       case-by-case basis (document on the Form 8/8a IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
       5.5.3.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations accomplished outside
       the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period
       beginning with the month in which the first ground requisite or flight evaluation was
       administered, whichever occurs first. EXCEPTION: For extended evaluations (IAW
       paragraph 5.8.3.2), requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-month
       eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration date.
       5.5.3.3. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements of combined
       evaluations as defined in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2.
       5.5.3.4. Requisites from a completed evaluation may be used for subsequent evaluations
       provided they cover all required areas and are within the requisite zone for each
       evaluation.
       5.5.3.5. For aircrew possessing instrument qualifications in multiple aircraft, one
       instrument exam may count for separate evaluations provided the instrument exam occurs
       within the zone for each evaluation IAW the paragraphs above.
       5.5.3.6. (Added-AETC) For initial and requalification evaluations, all ground phase
       requisite items must be completed prior to the flight phase of the evaluation.
5.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation.
   5.6.1. Recheck. If an aircrew member fails a flight evaluation, a successful flight or ground
   recheck must be completed by the end of the third month after the date of the first failure,
   (e.g. for an evaluation on 20 Jun 12, complete the recheck by 30 Sep 12).
       5.6.1.1. OG/CCs may approve waivers to the three-month time limit on a case-by-case
       basis.
          5.6.1.1.1. Document the waiver(s) with an MFR to be included in the AF Form 8/8a
          IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
       5.6.1.2. Commanders will determine the number of flights to be allowed during this
       period, based on the individual’s experience level, present qualifications and hours of
       training required.
       5.6.1.3. The flight examiner that administered the original check will not normally
       administer the recheck.
       5.6.1.4. A recheck is successfully completed when the aircrew member performs to Q or
       Q-/debriefed criteria for each area graded U.
       5.6.1.5. Ground rechecks may be directed when the flight examiner deems a flight
       recheck unnecessary, but are accomplished subsequent to the debriefing of a Q3
       evaluation (document IAW paragraph 7.3.9.2).
36                       AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012


     5.6.1.6. Requisites that were valid for a failed evaluation per paragraph 5.5.3.1 or 5.5.3.2
     remain valid, IAW the paragraphs above.
  5.6.2. Status Downgrade. Aircrew members receiving a Q3 INSTM, QUAL and/or MSN
  evaluation are non-mission ready (NMR)/non-combat mission ready (N-CMR)/non-basic
  mission capable(N-BMC)/non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ) IAW AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1.
  For instructor evaluations, aircrew status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC) need not be downgraded if
  the discrepancies were only in instructor areas/subareas.
  5.6.3. Restrictions. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the
  judgment of the flight examiner, flight restrictions will be imposed on the examinee until
  successful completion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck.
     5.6.3.1. Restrictions should address the specific phase of flight and/or operation that
     requires supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
         5.6.3.1.1. QUAL Evaluation: Place the examinee on supervised status (see
         paragraph 5.7) in the aircraft in which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the
         opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft. For
         specialized, universal, and/or multiple qualified aircrew maintaining qualification for
         similar duty in multiple aircraft, AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 may direct supervised status in
         all aircraft in which the individual maintains qualification.
         5.6.3.1.2. INSTM Evaluation: Restrictions apply to all aircraft in which the
         examinee is required to maintain instrument qualification.
         5.6.3.1.3. MSN       Evaluation:     The      examinee      may      perform    basic
         qualification/instrument tasks unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on
         supervised status for mission tasks.
         5.6.3.1.4. INSTR Evaluation (or any evaluation where instructor qualifications are
         being evaluated): Instructors receiving an unsatisfactory grade in any instructor
         area(s) will not perform instructor duties until a successful recheck is completed.
     5.6.3.2. Restrict aircrew receiving a Q3 on any evaluation until a successful recheck is
     completed (see paragraph 5.6.1).
     5.6.3.3. If defined in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1 and/or Vol 2, formal schoolhouses will include
     restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a for any core item not accomplished due to training
     limitations, regardless if the method of qualification is by evaluation or instructor
     certification. Under no circumstance will aircrew perform core items in which they are
     not qualified unless under the direct supervision of an instructor. In this case, MDS-
     specific guidance will set the time requirement for completion of additional training.
     5.6.3.4. Document restrictions on the AF Form 8/8a IAW paragraphs 7.3.5.7 and 7.3.7.1.
     5.6.3.5. (Added-AETC) An initial qualification examinee who is graded Q-2 with
     additional training required will not fly as a qualified crewmember until additional
     training is completed. Complete additional training prior to a student’s release from
     formal schooling. Instructors or examiners will administer additional training.
     5.6.3.6. (Added-AETC) An IP graded Q-2 on any evaluation will not perform instructor
     or examiner duties until additional training is completed.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012                                                37


5.7. Supervised Status.
   5.7.1. If unsatisfactory performance or restrictions require an examinee be placed on
   supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated supervisor) will be
   determined by the SQ/CC and/or as specified in AFI11-2MDS Vol 1.
   5.7.2. Supervision will only be accomplished by instructors or designated supervisors.
5.8. Timing of Aircrew Qualification Evaluations.
   5.8.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 17th
   month following the month in which the flight phase was successfully flown (e.g. a periodic
   evaluation in which the flight phase was completed on 9 Oct 10 expires on 31 Mar 12.).
   5.8.2. Eligibility Period. Periodic evaluations will be scheduled in the eligibility period,
   defined as the six-month period prior to the expiration date.
   5.8.3. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. On a case-by-case basis, periodic evaluations may be
   scheduled before or after the eligibility period according to the following criteria:
      5.8.3.1. Evaluations Conducted Prior to the Eligibility Period. SQ/CCs may
      authorize individuals to complete periodic evaluations prior to the eligibility period
      (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
      5.8.3.2. Extended Evaluations.
          5.8.3.2.1. HHQ-Extended Evaluations. HQ USAF/A3O-A may authorize blanket
          or group extensions on an as-required basis. Requests for extensions at MAJCOM or
          subordinate levels will be submitted IAW paragraph 1.3.2.
          5.8.3.2.2. MAJCOM-Extended           Evaluations. MAJCOM/A3s       may     extend
          evaluation expiration dates for individual aircrew members on a case-by-case basis
          IAW paragraph 1.3.1. Provide guidance for MAJCOM extensions in MAJCOM
          supplements to this instruction.
          5.8.3.2.3. SQ/CC-Extended Evaluations. SQ/CCs may extend the expiration date
          of periodic evaluations up to three months for the reasons listed below (document
          IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2). Extensions will be on a case-by-case basis and this
          paragraph is not authority to grant blanket extensions. For individual extensions
          longer than three months, see paragraph 5.8.3.2.2. For group or blanket extensions,
          see paragraph 5.8.3.2.1. Requisites not completed during the original eligibility
          period must be completed prior to the extended expiration date.
              5.8.3.2.3.1. PCS/PCA to a non-flying assignment.
              5.8.3.2.3.2. Departing PCS or TDY for retraining in another aircraft type.
              5.8.3.2.3.3. Undergoing unit aircraft conversion, as directed by MAJCOM.
              5.8.3.2.3.4. Removal from active flying status (e.g. separation or retirement).
              5.8.3.2.3.5. Participation in real world operations (to include operations other
              than war, alert, etc.) who are not able to complete the required flight evaluation(s)
              before or during deployment.
      5.8.3.3. Non-Standard Approval Authority
 38                        AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012


           5.8.3.3.1. For SQ/CCs and above (e.g. OG/CCs, WG/CCs, etc.), the approval
           authority is the next commander in the examinee’s flying chain of command.
           5.8.3.3.2. In all other cases, if the flying chain of command differs from
           administrative chain of command (e.g. HHQ attached flyers), approvals will be by the
           attached unit/CC with the concurrence of the examinee’s immediate administrative
           supervisor.
           5.8.3.3.3. For individuals not assigned to a MAJCOM, AF/A3O-A is the approval
           authority.
   5.8.4. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an aircrew
   member fails to complete an evaluation (either ground phase or flight phase) within the
   eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.2) or within the
   period for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation (see paragraph 5.8.3), the aircrew
   member loses the qualification covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph
   5.6.3 apply.
       5.8.4.1. Qualification may be re-established by accomplishing a complete requalification
       evaluation (to include requisites) or by completion of the delinquent evaluation.
       5.8.4.2. OG/CCs may waive the re-accomplishment of completed requisites on a case-
       by-case basis (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
5.9. Commander-Directed Downgrade. Any commander (squadron or above) may direct a
downgrade (Q-/U) in a specific area/sub-area without unqualifying an individual. Additionally, a
commander may direct a downgrade that either removes a qualification (e.g. IP to MP) or
completely unqualifies an individual (e.g. MP to UP). Downgrades may be directed without
administering an evaluation using the following guidance:
   5.9.1. For flying-related cases, use for cause only (e.g., breach of flying discipline, flight
   safety, etc.). Incidents do not have to be directly observed by an examiner, but may be
   recommended by an examiner from any MDS/aircrew specialty.
   5.9.2. For non-flying-related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of,
   administrative or judicial actions (e.g. Letter of Counseling, Article 15, etc.). (Consult with
   the supporting SJA office for legal advice in these cases.) Use in cases where such incidences
   directly affect the commander’s confidence in the aircrew member’s ability to safely operate
   the aircraft and/or equipment (e.g. lapse in judgment significant enough to cast doubt on the
   aircrew’s decision-making abilities in the aircraft).
   5.9.3. For downgrades that either remove qualifications or completely unqualify an
   individual, the affected aircrew will cease acting in the qualification(s) from which they have
   been downgraded effective with the date the commander initiated the downgrade.
   5.9.4. Commander Directed Downgrades will be documented IAW paragraph 7.4.
5.10. Multiple Qualification. Multiple qualification guidance applies to aircrew members who
maintain qualification in two or more MDS aircraft. For Universal Qualification see paragraph
5.11.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012                                               39


   5.10.1. When differences between aircraft in the same MDS are great enough, the lead
   MAJCOM, in coordination with using MAJCOMs, will identify requirements for separate
   qualification requirements.
   5.10.2. When separate qualifications are not required, document certification in different
   MDS series using AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. In lieu of the AF Form
   4348, MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification document signed by an authorized
   official.
   5.10.2. (AETC) In addition to documenting certification on the AF Form 4348, units will
   document aircrew certifications on the unit letter of Xs according to AETC supplement to
   AFI 11-202, Volume 1, Aircrew Training.
   5.10.3. Documentation. Document MAJCOM authority for multiple qualification,
   including a list of aircraft in which qualification will be maintained IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
   See AFI 11-202, Vol 1.
   5.10.4. Instrument Evaluation. Pilots need only complete an INSTM evaluation, to
   include requisites, in one of the aircraft in which they maintain qualification as specified by
   the authorizing MAJCOM unless additional INSTM evaluation requirements are directed by
   the MAJCOM in its supplement to this instruction.
   5.10.5. QUAL and MSN Evaluations. All aircrew require a QUAL evaluation, and, if
   applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in each MDS aircraft they maintain
   qualification according to applicable AFI MDS Vol 2, or AFI 16-1202 Vol 2.
   5.10.6. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. A Q3 on an INSTM evaluation results in a
   downgrade in all aircraft flown in which instrument qualification is required. A downgrade
   resulting from a Q3 in a QUAL or MSN evaluation applies only to the aircraft for which the
   evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the discrepancy is
   applicable to additional aircraft.
5.11. Universal Qualification. Universal qualification guidance applies to specialized aircrew
who maintain qualification in two or more MDS where qualification is attained/maintained via a
minimum of a ground phase examination. A flight phase evaluation, when required, may be
accomplished on any of the aircraft in which the aircrew member is either gaining or maintaining
qualification.
5.11. (AETC)Universal qualification eligibility will be according to MDS-specific volumes
1 and 2.
   5.11.1. Applicability. Specialized aircrew may gain/maintain aircraft qualifications IAW
   Universal Qualification guidance. MAJCOMs will identify Universal Qualified crewmember
   eligibility in the MAJCOM supplement to this AFI.
   5.11.2. Documentation. See Chapter 7 or Chapter 8, as applicable.
   5.11.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew qualifications maintained
   under Universal Qualification guidance are considered a QUAL evaluation. A MSN
   evaluation may be directed by applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 and/or MAJCOM supplement
   to this Instruction. MSN evaluations, when required, will include a flight phase evaluation in
   one MDS that the Specialized Aircrew member maintains qualification.

   5.11.4. Failure to Pass a Requisite/Flight Evaluation. Failure of universally qualified
   aircrew members to pass a ground requisite or flight phase evaluation results in loss of
   applicable aircraft qualification, IAW MAJCOM supplement and AFI MDS Vol 2.
5.12. Aircrew Flying in Non-USAF Aircraft and with Non-USAF Units. Aircrew members
authorized to perform duties in non-USAF aircraft IAW AFI 11-401, or on duty with or attached
to non-USAF units for flying, abide by host service or host country guidance, except for the
requirement to maintain a current physical and review their flight records according to AFI 11-
202, Vol 1 and AFI 11-401.
   5.12.1. Aircrew flying with non-USAF units (i.e. Exchange) do not need to abide by USAF
   guidance, including this AFI and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2. Therefore, when they return to USAF
   units, they must complete applicable requisites and be evaluated for any periodic USAF
   evaluations that expired during their tour. The restrictions in paragraph 5.6.3 of this
   instruction apply to such individuals until successful evaluations are completed.
   5.12.2. MAJCOM/A3s may approve exceptions to requirements for returning Exchange
   aircrew members to complete applicable requisites and expired USAF evaluations, if they
   determine non-USAF evaluations are equivalent to applicable AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2
   evaluations (document IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2).
   5.12.3. USAF units that use non-USAF aircraft to execute a USAF flying program will
   comply with current USAF guidance, unless when excepted by proper authority. See AFI 11-
   401 for definitions of USAF and US Government aircraft.
5.13. Initial Cadre.
   5.13.1. Aircrew members who are appointed by their MAJCOMs as initial cadre either for a
   new mission set requiring a MSN qualification or for a new MDS where no flight examiner
   currently exists will comply with the intent of this instruction.
   5.13.2. See paragraph 7.5 for guidance on Form 8/8a documentation.
   5.13.3. MAJCOMs will indicate through MFR which aircrew are appointed as initial cadre
   and include in the FEF IAW paragraph 7.8.3.2.2.
   5.13.4. Tailor recurring evaluations to program requirements and aircraft capabilities.
   Simulators may be used to satisfy recurring evaluation requirements.
   5.13.5. Pilots in these programs will maintain an instrument qualification (see paragraph
   5.2.2). Maintenance of the instrument qualification, if not practical due to the developing
   capabilities of the new mission set and/or MDS, will be accomplished in aircraft possessing
   similar flying qualities/instrumentation as stipulated in the MAJCOM supplement/AFI 11-
   MDS Vol 2/MOU.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012                                             41

                         AIRCREW EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The aircrew examination program measures aircrew member knowledge of
normal/emergency procedures, threats, and other information essential for the safe and effective
operation of their assigned weapon system through the administration of written or computer-
based examinations.
6.2. Scope. This chapter applies to rated (pilots, Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) pilots,
navigators, combat systems operators, and air battle managers), CEA, non-rated X-prefix AE
aircrew and RPA sensor operators. For Flight Surgeons (rated), Combat Camera, and non-rated
aircrew (K-, Q-, or other X-prefix Air Force Specialty Code) that only require an examination to
establish qualification, see Chapter 8. The examination program in this chapter includes
requisite examinations for periodic evaluations and unit periodic examinations. Requisite
examinations include qualification open book and closed book examinations, instrument
examinations and Boldface/CAPs examinations as described in paragraph 5.5.1.1.
6.3. Administrative Procedures.
   6.3.1. Program Documentation. Units will document the unit-level aircrew examination
   program.
   6.3.2. Computer-Based Examinations. MAJCOM directed Stan/Eval software may fulfill
   the requirement for exams as outlined in this instruction.
   6.3.3. Retention of Examination Records. Retain graded exam answer sheets/computer
   records until the AF Form 8/8a is completed.
   6.3.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) OGV will manage the aircrew examination program.
   Squadron DOV will administer examinations through PEX or TIMS when authorized. The
   open and closed book exams will not be issued simultaneously. The closed book exam must
   be completed in one sitting. Any paper answer sheets will be destroyed after the AF Form 8
   is final and on file in the IP’s FEF.
6.4. Exam Sources.
   6.4.1. Open Book Exams. Open book questions will come from publications containing
   information pertinent to the operation of applicable aircraft and performance of the assigned
   mission.
       6.4.1.1. The open book subject areas and the publications used to generate the exam will
       be made available to aircrew during testing. Electronic publications may be used as
       references for open book examinations.
       6.4.1.2. Each unit will develop an open book Secure Question Bank (SQB) that serves as
       the source for the open book exam. Do not distribute the SQB to unit aircrews and
       safeguard it in the same manner as any other required Stan/Eval exam.
       6.4.1.2. (AETC) Published MQFs will not be used to develop open-book examinations.
       The open-book examination will consist of a minimum of 50 questions to a maximum of
       100 questions. However, if they are developed, Units will forward one copy of each SQB,
42                       AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012


     along with one copy of the open-book examination and all subsequent changes, to the
     NAF/DO(A3) within 10 workdays of SQB publication.
  6.4.2. Closed Book Exams. Questions will come from MQFs.
  6.4.2. (AETC) Closed-book examinations will have a minimum of 25 questions and a
  maximum of 50 questions.
     6.4.2.1. MDS/crew position-specific MQFs. Lead MAJCOMs will ensure MDS/crew-
     specific MQFs are available for using MAJCOM use and distribution to applicable
     aircrew.
     6.4.2.1. (AETC) 19 AF/DO will publish separate master question banks (MQB) for
     each AETC lead-command aircraft. The OGV will develop wing MQFs from 19 AF
     MQBs. Each aircraft MQF should consist of 300 questions.
         6.4.2.1.1. Units may edit MQFs to accommodate local testing procedures,
         administrative errors and reflect recent changes to systems and/or operational
         procedures; however, subject matter may not be changed.
         6.4.2.1.2. Units will forward edits of MQF questions to the appropriate MAJCOM.
         Lead MAJCOMs will review MQFs annually and distribute changes to MQFs as
         necessary.
         6.4.2.1.2. (AETC) HQ AETC/A3 delegates the annual review of lead-command
         aircraft MQFs (and distribution of MQF changes) to the 19 AF/DO. Units will
         forward edits of lead-command aircraft MQF questions to the 19 AF/DO. Where
         AETC is not the lead command, units will forward edits of MQF questions through
         the NAF/DO(A3) to the lead command.
     6.4.2.2. Local Procedures MQF. Units may develop and distribute a local procedures
     MQF to augment MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
     6.4.2.2. (AETC) Units will develop, maintain, and distribute local procedures MQFs.
     HHQ approval is not required. Forward copies to the NAF/DO(A3) within 10 workdays
     of publication. Local procedures MQFs may be combined with MDS-specific MQFs.
     6.4.2.2. (COLUMBUSAFB) OGV will develop and maintain the local procedures
     MQF. CSI can use the MDS MQF or develop a CSI specific MQF.
  6.4.3. Instrument Exams. Reference AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Program.
  Units will ensure that only those questions relevant to the weapons system(s) and instrument
  procedures within their unit are included in the available questions from which aircrew will
  test.
  6.4.4. Exam Question Review. The MAJCOM, NAF, and OG Stan/Eval functions will
  review all MDS/crew position-specific MQFs, SQBs, and prepared exams (if used) annually
  and after any changes in source documents. If a complete review was accomplished due to a
  source document change it may be annotated as the annual review. Units will document
  procedures for the exam reviews in their supplement to this instruction.
  6.4.4. (COLUMBUSAFB) Squadron DOVs will notify OGV of any outdated questions to
  forward to AETC/A3VU. OGV will review all MDS MQFs, SQBs, and prepared exams
  annually or as required for source document changes. The date in Patriot Excalibur (PEX) or
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012                                              43


   training information management system (TIMS) will be used for the annual review date or it
   will be annotated by the OPR if PEX/TIMS does not track the updates.
6.5. End-of-Course Exams. FTUs administering USAF Formal School courses listed in the Air
Force      Education     and    Training    Course     Announcement        (ETCA)    database
(https://etca.randolph.af.mil/) may use end-of-course (EOC) exams to fulfill the requirements
of the open book, closed book and Boldface/CAPS (if applicable) requisite exams.
   6.5.1. The Stan/Eval agencies of the MAJCOM responsible for training will coordinate with
   the MDS lead MAJCOM to ensure the EOC exam meets the requirements of this instruction
   and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2 before awarding credit for requisite completion.
   6.5.1. (AETC) Units will ensure all end-of-course examinations meet open-book and
   closed-book requisite examination requirements of the basic AFI and AFI 11-2MDS Vol 2
   and send a copy to the syllabus OPR. The syllabus OPR will forward all EOC exams to
   AETC/A3FV for coordination with the lead MAJCOM. When EOC exams are randomly
   generated from a question bank, the question bank must be coordinated. Ensure all
   appropriate security measures are met when transmitting exams. Units will complete a
   review annually and within 30 days of publication changes. Procedures will be outlined in a
   unit supplement.
   6.5.2. EOC exam questions do not need to incorporate MDS/crew position-specific MQFs.
   All questions must reflect the latest changes to all systems and/or operational procedures and
   not conflict with any MQFs.
   6.5.3. All EOC exams that fulfill the requirements of requisite exams will be graded
   according to paragraph 6.8 and entered on the AF Form 8/8a according to paragraph 7.3.5.1.
6.6. Exam Management. With the exception of written Boldface/CAPs exams, units will either
maintain prepared exams for each crew position or generate a unique exam for each aircrew
member.
   6.6.1. If prepared exams are maintained for each crew position:
       6.6.1.1. Units are required to develop and control a minimum of two exams for each
       crew position.
       6.6.1.1. (COLUMBUSAFB) OGV will develop a minimum of two open and closed
       book examinations for each crew position. CSI will develop the tests for CSI. CSI can
       use the existing MDS tests and remove any questions that do not apply to CSI, and they
       may add CSI specific questions. CSI can also develop their own tests from appropriate
       MQFs and SQBs if available and desired.
       6.6.1.2. Units having ten or fewer members per crew position require only one exam.
       6.6.1.3. When different crew positions are responsible for the same information, units are
       not required to maintain separate exams for each crew position.
       6.6.1.4. Change a minimum of 50 percent of the questions on each prepared exam each
       calendar year.
   6.6.2. If a unique exam is generated for each aircrew member:
       6.6.2.1. Units may use MAJCOM-approved software for exam creation.
 44                       AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012


       6.6.2.1. (AETC) NAF/DO(A3) must approve software used for test creation.
       6.6.2.2. Requisite exam databases will contain at least twice the number of questions
       required for each exam (e.g. if a 50-question exam is generated, there must be at least 100
       questions in the exam database).
   6.6.3. When published guidance changes, the associated prepared exam or exam database
   (depending on method used) will be updated as soon as possible upon receipt.
6.7. Exam Security. Stan/Eval personnel will maintain positive control of all requisite exams,
applicable answer sheets, and associated computer-based media.
6.8. Grading.
   6.8.1. Boldface/CAPs. Grade Boldface/CAPs exams on the two-tier grading system (i.e.
   Q/U). Satisfactory performance requires writing the proper actions in the correct sequence,
   not necessarily a verbatim response. The minimum passing grade is 100 percent.
   6.8.2. Written or Computer-Based Examinations. Grade written or computer based
   examinations as a percentage of correct answers. The minimum passing grade is 85 percent.
   All questions missed will be reviewed immediately following the exam.
   6.8.2. (COLUMBUSAFB) Pilots (UP/FP/MP/IP) will not complete a requisite test unless a
   squadron DOV or OGV member is present to grade it at the time of completion. If squadron
   DOV or OGV is no longer able to monitor the testing area, the examinee’s test and answer
   key will be collected and filed, or computerized testing module closed and logged out until
   monitored testing can be resumed.
   6.8.3. Units will grade all requisite and/or Boldface/CAPs exams prior to the aircrew
   member’s next flight.
   6.8.4. (Added-AETC) Boldface steps will be written as depicted in flight manual.
   Abbreviations or contractions of procedures or actions are not allowed unless they are used in
   the flight manual. Minor spelling errors are acceptable as long as the intent is clear and the
   meaning of the action is not changed. For example, “propellor” (instead of “propeller”)
   would be acceptable, but “throttle” (instead of “throttles”) would not be acceptable because
   the meaning is changed. Units may supply a preformatted answer sheet that includes boldface
   titles, step numbers, etc.
   6.8.5. (Added-AETC) Critical action procedures (CAP) answers must contain all
   procedures in the proper sequence. Abbreviations are allowed.
6.9. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam.
   6.9.1. Reexamination Policy. An aircrew member failing a requisite examination must be
   afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. For other than Boldface/CAPs, the
   aircrew member will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
   6.9.1. (COLUMBUSAFB) Notify OG/OGV of all failed tests. The flight evaluation will
   not be completed until all failed exams have been successfully re-accomplished.
   6.9.2. Reexamination Period. Aircrew members who fail a requisite exam must complete a
   successful reexam by the end of the third month following the date of the first failure, or the
   end of their eligibility period, whichever occurs first. Waiver authority to extend the time
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012                                                 45


   allowed to successfully complete the reexam is the OG/CC (document IAW paragraph
   7.8.3.2.2).
   6.9.3. Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction. Aircrew members failing a
   Boldface/CAPs exam will not fly as aircrew members until a successful Boldface/CAPs
   reexam is accomplished.
   6.9.4. Supervised Status.
       6.9.4.1. Place aircrew members who fail a requisite open/closed book or instrument
       exam in supervised status IAW paragraph 5.7 until successful retesting is completed.
       6.9.4.2. For aircrew members who maintain multiple qualifications, supervised status
       resulting from failure of either an open or closed book examination applies only to the
       aircraft for which the examination was administered. Failure of the instrument exam
       results in the examinee being placed in supervised status in all aircraft in which
       instrument qualification is required.
6.10. Unit Periodic Examinations (Optional). If used, MAJCOMs and/or units will include
guidance in their supplements to include procedures for failed exams.
6.10. (AETC)Unit Periodic Examinations. (Not applicable to ARC) Each unit stan/eval will
conduct and document periodic testing at least semiannually. The MQF will not be used to
develop questions. For other than Boldface/CAPs, periodic exams will be corrected to 100%
prior to the next flight.
6.10. (COLUMBUSAFB)Squadron DOV will develop and administer semi-annual tests in
January and July. These tests will consist of a minimum of 25 questions. Tests may be open
or closed book at the discretion of the SQ/CC. All tests will be approved by OGV prior to
administration. Minimum passing score on the semiannual test is 85% -- corrected to 100%.
Failed tests must be re-administered within 30 calendar days. Squadron DOV will track results
of all tests and keep on file for 1 year. Only pilots assigned or attached to the unit on the day of
the test need to take the test. New pilots who arrive after the date of the test will take the next
scheduled test.
   6.10.1. Each group/squadron Stan/Eval function may conduct periodic testing for all aircrew.
   The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional knowledge beyond the scope of requisite
   exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge, tactical/threat knowledge, and/or
   operational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge deficiencies exist within the unit.
   6.10.2. Administration of the exam is at the discretion of the MAJCOM and/or unit.
   6.10.3. Periodic exams will not count as a requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy
   the requirement for a periodic exam.
   6.10.4. (Added-AETC) Monthly Boldface/CAPS Requirement. At a minimum, all
   aircrew will successfully complete a boldface/CAPS examination prior to the first flight of
   the month. (Exception: For units utilizing programs with a 30-day rolling window,
   Boldface/CAPS must be accomplished within the last 30 days.) All aircrew will be placed in
   a no-fly status in the unit Go/No-go until successful completion.

                                           Chapter 7

                                     DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the aircrew qualification evaluation program requires accurate
documentation. The qualifications for which an aircrew member is to be evaluated are
determined from the unit certification document. This chapter provides documentation guidance
for members that require an in-flight evaluation to establish qualification. See Chapter 8 for
documentation guidance pertaining to flight surgeons, combat camera, and non-rated aircrew that
only require an examination to establish qualification.
   7.1.1. The results of aircrew evaluations are recorded on the AF Form 8/8a. The
   chronological history of evaluations for an aircrew member is recorded on an AF Form 942,
   Record of Evaluation. These AF forms are maintained in the FEF.
   7.1.1. (AETC) 306 FTG units may use locally developed flight evaluation worksheets
   (paragraph 7.3.8.1.) as the official flight evaluation certificate for United States Air Force
   Academy (USAFA) cadets. Keep these forms in the examinee’s training folder or other unit-
   designated location and give them to the member when they leave the Academy.
   7.1.2. In all instances of documentation, use of electronic forms is authorized, to include use
   of electronic signatures and wholly electronic FEFs IAW MAJCOM supplement guidance. In
   all instances, computer-generated forms must mirror AF forms as published on the USAF E-
   Publishing web site.
7.2. Qualifications versus Certifications. Qualifications are attained through evaluations and
documented on the AF Form 8/8a, as applicable. Certifications are attained through methods
other than evaluation (e.g. commander certifications, flight lead upgrades, etc.) and may be
documented on an AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications or on a unit certification
document signed by an authorized official.
7.2. (AETC) Qualifications versus Certifications. Units will document aircrew certifications
on an AF Form 4348 and the unit letter of Xs in accordance with the AETC supplement to AFI
11-202, Volume 1. Exception: ARC units need not use AF Form 4348.
7.3. AF Form 8/8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   7.3.1. Purpose. The AF Form 8/8a is the source document used to record and verify the
   qualification of an aircrew member.
       7.3.1.1. Use the AF Form 8 to record aircrew qualification in a single aircraft.
       7.3.1.2. Use of the AF Form 8a is optional for aircrew maintaining qualification in
       multiple aircraft and/or multiple series qualification in the same MDS or are Universal
       Qualified.
       7.3.1.3. Completion of an AF Form 8/8a is accomplished by four individuals: the flight
       examiner, a Reviewing Officer, a Final Approving Officer, and the examinee.
   7.3.2. General Data Entry. See Attachment 3 for sample AF Forms 8, Attachment 4 for
   sample AF Forms 8a.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012                                                47


     7.3.2.1. In all instances of data entry, if an electronic form is used, the format required by
     the electronic form will be used (see also paragraph 7.1.2).
     7.3.2.2. For date fields use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-digit year format
     (e.g. 24 Jun 12).
     7.3.2.3. The “Eligibility Period” and “Expiration Date of Qualification” blocks will use a
     three-letter month and two-digit year format (Jun 12).
     7.3.2.4. Except where specifically noted otherwise (i.e. annotating the type evaluation,
     “INSTR”), use upper and lower case letters.
     7.3.2.5. Requirements for font, indentation, and justification (right, left or centered) of
     data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format standards as
     desired.
  7.3.3. Date Completed.
     7.3.3.1. Use the latest completion date of the evaluation requisites (ground or flight
     phase) or the additional training if assigned.
     7.3.3.2. (Form 8a) Use the latest completion date of all MDS listed.
  7.3.4. - Examinee Identification.
     7.3.4.1. Name, Rank (USAF-standard abbreviated or non-abbreviated rank is acceptable)
     and last four of Social Security Number (SSN).

         7.3.4.2.1. Enter the unit designation and location where the examinee is
         assigned/attached for flying (actual unit/office symbol will be annotated IAW
         paragraph 7.3.6.4).
         7.3.4.2.1. (AETC) Enter the unit designation and location where the examinee is
         assigned.
         7.3.4.2.2. For FTU courses in which an evaluation is administered, the organization
         and location will reflect the FTU organization/location.
     7.3.4.3. Aircraft/Crew Position.
         7.3.4.3.1. Enter the MDS in which the evaluation was given
         7.3.4.3.2. (Form 8a) Enter the aircraft MDS in which the flight phase evaluation
         was given. When no flight phase evaluation was accomplished or when aircrew are
         qualified in two or more aircraft IAW Universal Qualification guidelines, enter the
         primary aircraft MDS.
         7.3.4.3.3. Enter the examinee’s highest qualification reflecting the intention of the
         evaluation in that particular MDS. Note: Examiner (e.g. EP, EF, etc.) is not a
         qualification, it is a certification, and should only be entered when the flight examiner
         is receiving a SPOT Flight Examiner Objectivity evaluation IAW MAJCOM
         supplements.

        paragraph 5.3.3 by placing a “1” (for Q1) or “2” (for Q2) in the qualified block or a
        “3” (for Q3) in the unqualified block.
        7.3.5.3.2. Combined evaluations (e.g., INSTM/QUAL, INSTM/QUAL/MSN, etc.)
        require only one grade if all evaluations were awarded the same overall level.
            7.3.5.3.2.1. If the overall level varies for each type of evaluation accomplished,
            indicate the qualification level for each part separately (e.g., “INSTM: 1” and
            “QUAL: 2” in the qualified block or “INSTM/MSN: 1” in the qualified block and
            “QUAL: 3” in the unqualified block).
        7.3.5.3.3. (Form 8a) Place a 1, 2, or 3 in the Qual Level block next to the applicable

        7.3.5.4.3. Combined evaluations require only one date if all parts of the evaluation
        were successfully completed and/or “N/A” if all parts were assigned an unqualified
        grade.
            7.3.5.4.3.1. For combined evaluations where one component is successfully
            completed and/or one component is assigned an unqualified grade, indicate by
            assigning a new expiration date for those portions completed successfully, and
            “N/A” for those portions awarded an unqualified grade (e.g., QUAL 1 and
            INSTM 3, then enter “QUAL-Jul 12” under Qualified and “INSTM-N/A” under
            Unqualified).

     7.3.6.2. Reviewing and Final Approving Officers.
        7.3.6.2.1. (Form 8a) A Reviewing Officer is not required for non-rated aircrew with
        only ground phase examination requisites for qualification.
        7.3.6.2.2. The Reviewing and Final Approving Officers (those officers holding these
        positions, or acting in their stead during the period of the signature process -- not
        necessarily the date of the evaluation) will review the content of the AF Form 8/8a
        and the flight examiner’s overall assessment, ensure all required additional training is
        adequate to correct the noted deficiencies and is complete, and will place an “X” in
        the “Concur” block.
            7.3.6.2.2.1. If either or both officers do not agree with any portion of the Form
            8/8a, the overall grade will not be changed, but the dissenting officer will place an
            “X” in the “Do Not Concur” block on his/her line of the AF Form 8/8a.
            7.3.6.2.2.2. If “Do Not Concur” is marked, the non-concurring officer(s) will
            provide justification (e.g. reason for non-concurrence, suggested modifications to
            additional training as recommended by the flight examiner, etc.) IAW paragraph
            7.3.7.4 and/or paragraph 7.3.7.5.

        examiner, but prior to the Final Approval Officer.
        7.3.6.2.4. The Final Approval Officer will sign and date the AF Form 8/8a after the
        Reviewing Officer but prior to the examinee. As applicable, the Final Approving
        Officer may recommend or give a commander-directed downgrade IAW paragraph
        5.9 if further action is warranted.
        7.3.6.2.5. MAJCOMs will specify in the MAJCOM supplement who the reviewing
        and final approving officers will be for evaluations other than formal course
        evaluations accomplished at an FTU. The same individual will not sign as both the
        Reviewing and Final Approving Officer.
        7.3.6.2.5. (AETC) SEFEs will use Table 4.1. (Added), this supplement, to determine
        an examinee’s reviewing and final approving officer and additional reviewers.
        7.3.6.2.6. For evaluations completed at formal course FTU locations, the reviewing
        and final approving officers will be assigned to the FTU.
     7.3.6.3. Organization Block Format. The format and content of data for the
     Organization block for the flight examiner and reviewing and final approving officers
     will be as follows:
        7.3.6.3.1. Flight examiner. Annotate unit/organization and office symbol of the
        flight examiner that completed the evaluation (e.g., 526 ARS/DOT, 12AF/OV,

      documenting certifications by assigned flying unit and primary MDS. For aircrew
      members with aircraft certifications in multiple MDS aircraft which do not require
      qualification in each aircraft (e.g. F-16C and F-16CM), only one AF Form 4348 is
      required; specify the primary mission MDS designation.
      7.6.1.2. Unit Stan/Eval will document all initial, downgrade and re-certifications for
      aircrew assigned/attached to their flying unit to indicate a chronological history of
      certifications of aircrew while assigned/attached to their flying unit.
      7.6.1.3. During the initial review of individual FEF, also review previous AF Form 4348
      entries to determine all applicable certifications of new assigned/attached aircrew
      member. Then, document applicable aircrew certifications accepted by the gaining flying
      unit commander on a new AF Form 4348.
      7.6.1.4. The OGV/squadron Stan/Eval Chief or other individual designated by the
      SQ/CC will sign a one line entry below all other entries verifying that above certification
      transcriptions are accurate.
      7.6.1.5. Do not use AF Form 4348 to document one-time training/new equipment unless
      directed by MAJCOM.
      7.6.1.6. Appropriate guidance that may require aircrew certification using AF Form 4348
      entry include MAJCOM and/or supplement; AFI11-2MDS Vol 1; AFI11-2MDS Vol 3.

     7.6.2.1. Complete individual identification block with last name, first name, middle
     initial, any titles (e.g., Jr. or II), last four of SSN, unit MDS and unit (assigned/attached
     for flying) organization/location.
     7.6.2.2. Use one line for each certification.
     7.6.2.3. Enter each certification in chronological order based on the date the action is
     completed.
     7.6.2.4. For date fields in the AF Form 4348, use a two-digit day, three-letter month and
     two-digit year format, or as required for electronic forms.
  7.6.3. Certification.
     7.6.3.1. Certified Event Title. Enter each certification title on the top block on the AF
     Form 4348.
     7.6.3.2. Enter the instructor’s rank, name and organization who completed applicable
     training for the certified event below the event title of the Certified Event block for the
     MDS under which the certification is given.
     7.6.3.3. Date Certified. Enter the effective date of certification.
     7.6.3.4. For certifications attained as part of a FTU, the date will match the date of the
     applicable AF Form 8/8a, or enter the date of completion or graduation from FTU if no
     AF Form 8/8a is issued.
     7.6.3.5. Certification Official/Organization. MAJCOM Supplement will specify AF
     Form 4348 certifying officials. The Certifying Official will sign above their typed name,
     rank, organization and office symbol.
     7.6.3.5. (AETC) Except where otherwise specified, the SQ/CC will sign the AF Form
     4348 as the certifying official. This authority may be delegated no lower than the SQ/DO.
     7.6.3.6. The Certifying Official is the person authorized by governing directives to
     approve or certify an aircrew member for a specific position or event.
     7.6.3.7. If a certification is given with restrictions, state the restrictions on the AF Form
     4348 in the Remarks block.
  7.6.4. Decertification. Decertification of events fall into two categories: Decertification for
  Cause (with prejudice) and Discretionary Decertification (without prejudice).
     7.6.4.1. Decertification for Cause. Used for observed substandard performance.
         7.6.4.1.1. This action is normally associated with Commander-Directed Downgrade,
         but also applies to commander-directed decertification of evaluators (resulting from
         substandard performance).
         7.6.4.1.2. To document Decertification for Cause, place an “X” in the appropriate
         box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
         organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
         Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7 for example.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012                                             61


     7.6.4.2. Discretionary Decertification. An administrative action not based on
     performance.
         7.6.4.2.1. Such decertification is warranted when loss of currency or certification
         occurs that will not be regained IAW AFI11-2 Vol 1, when instructor certified events
         become core mission events, or when a higher certification is obtained making the
         previous entry obsolete. Discretionary Decertification is also applicable for
         decertification of flight examiners as a result of reasons other than substandard
         performance.
         7.6.4.2.2. To document Discretionary Decertification, place an “X” in the appropriate
         box; enter date of decertification under Decertification Date block; enter name, rank,
         organization and office symbol and signature of the decertifying official under
         Decertifying Official/Organization block; see Attachment 7. Note: For decertification
         due to loss of currency with no requirement for re-certification, the effective date of
         decertification will be the date of certification loss.
         7.6.4.2.3. For events that have changed in name only (e.g., In-Flight Refueling to Air
         Refueling) no action is necessary. If desired for clarity: annotate “Renamed (new
         title)” under Remarks.
         7.6.4.2.4. For members who change MDS while assigned/attached to the same
         Stan/Eval organization, prepare a new AF Form 4348 indicating the new MDS and
         transcribe all events which apply to the new MDS IAW paragraph 7.6.1.3.
  7.6.5. Unusual Circumstances. When unusual circumstances require additional
  information for an AF Form 4348 entry, use additional lines as necessary or reaccomplish the
  AF Form 4348.
  7.6.6. Computer Generated AF Forms 4348. Units may use a computer-generated AF
  Form 4348 to make new entries or corrections as long as cumulative hard copy entries are
  maintained. Computer-generated AF forms must mirror AF forms published on the Air Force
  e-Publishing web site.
     7.6.6.1. A computer-generated AF Form 4348 must be signed IAW guidance in this
     section. The signature on a computer-generated AF Form 4348 certifies:
         7.6.6.1.1. New or rescinded certification attained while assigned/attached to unit of
         certifying official.
         7.6.6.1.2. All cumulative entries were maintained; that they were signed or had
         proper documentation; or were carried forward from a previously signed computer-
         generated AF Form 4348.
  7.6.7. Unit Supplement. Describe unit AF Form 4348 procedures/program. Include a list of
  certifications applicable to the unit with appropriate source documents and designated
  certifying officials. Document procedures to ensure certifications reflected on AF Form 4348
  are also included in ARMS. Annotate if someone other than the Chief of OGV/squadron
  Stan/Eval has been authorized by the SQ/CC to sign the last line of an AF Form 4348 to
  signify transcription accuracy.
  7.6.7. (COLUMBUSAFB) AF Form 4348 will be completed and kept in the members
  training folder. Applicable certifications will be documented in aviation resource
 62                       AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012


   management systems (ARMS) by filling out a AF Form 4324, Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew
   Qualification Worksheet and submitting it to SARMs. All AF Form 4324s will be
   maintained within the individuals training folder. The squadron chief of training, runway
   supervisor unit training and standardization officer (RSUTSO), or runway supervisor training
   unit training officer (RSUTO), when applicable, are authorized to sign the last line of an AF
   Form 4348 to signify transcription accuracy.

         7.8.3.2.1. AF Forms 8/8a. File AF Forms 8/8a in chronological order with the most
         recent on top. Individuals who maintain qualification in two or more MDSs or two or
         more crew positions in the same MDS will file AF Forms 8/8a in chronological order
         – without consideration of MDS or crew position.
         7.8.3.2.2. MFRs.
            7.8.3.2.2.1. MFRs documenting waivers, extensions, and/or unusual
            circumstances to potentially be included in an AF Form 8/8a are filed on top of
            the affected AF Form 8/8a.
                7.8.3.2.2.1.1. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the
                applicable AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks paragraph D, Additional
                Comments, when action is complete.
                7.8.3.2.2.1.2. Once MFR information is incorporated onto the AF Form 8/8a,
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012                                            67


                remove the MFR from the FEF.
            7.8.3.2.2.2. Expiration Date Extensions (see also paragraph 5.8.3.2).
                7.8.3.2.2.2.1. On the expiration date extension MFR specify extension
                authority, the new expiration date, and a brief description of the extension.
                7.8.3.2.2.2.2. MFRs will be dated prior to the expiration date of any affected
                periodic evaluation.
            7.8.3.2.2.3. Permanent MFRs. MFRs become a permanent part of the FEF only
            when a Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by
            a later Form 8 (see paragraph 7.8.6.1) or an unusual circumstance cannot be
            documented any other way.
  7.8.4. Hard-Copy Folders.
     7.8.4.1. Folders must be letter size, able to separate contents into two sections and
     constructed of heavy stock (recommend press board folder or equivalent).
     7.8.4.2. Standard 2 ¾-inch metal fasteners may be used.
     7.8.4.3. Affix a label bearing the individual’s name and last four of SSN to the inside
     back cover so that the folder may be identified when filed. Include additional information
     on the label if required by MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
     7.8.4.4. Folders must bear the “For Official Use Only” label/stamp on both sides of the
     FEF.
  7.8.5. Review of FEF. Document the procedures on how to accomplish an initial review
  and how to implement the periodic review of FEFs.
     7.8.5.1. Initial Review. The flying unit will review the FEF for all newly assigned
     aircrew members to verify their qualification(s) (and certifications on AF Form 4348 if
     used) prior to their first flight.
        7.8.5.1.1. The reviewing organization is responsible for establishing the qualification
        of the aircrew member as determined from the latest applicable documentation in
        Sections I and II of the FEF.
        7.8.5.1.2. Following the initial review, the unit maintaining the FEF is responsible
        only for documentation subsequently placed in the FEF.
        7.8.5.1.3. If the FEF of HHQ personnel on active flying status is maintained by the
        Stan/Eval function at the unit/squadron to which they are attached to fly, the
        Stan/Eval function of that unit/squadron will also review the FEF prior to their first
        flight.
     7.8.5.2. Posting Review.
        7.8.5.2.1. The Stan/Eval function will review each AF Form 8/8a and AF Forms
        4348 (if used) when they are placed in the FEF to ensure accuracy and completeness.
        7.8.5.2.2. The Form 8/8a review will confirm that the eligibility period and
        qualification as documented are correct, all required flight evaluation events and
68                      AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012

        signature and to ensure all previous entries are accurate and accounted for.
        7.8.5.2.4. Document the posting review IAW unit or MAJCOM supplement.
        7.8.5.2.4. (AETC) The stan/eval function will annually review all assigned and
        attached aircrew members’ FEFs. Unit supplement will establish procedures for
        documenting FEF reviews. Note: FEFs of nonpermanent party aircrew members do
        not need to be reviewed.
        7.8.5.2.4. (COLUMBUSAFB) Document the annual review on the AF Form 942
        IAW Attachment 10.
     7.8.5.3. Periodic Review.
        7.8.5.3.1. The Stan/Eval function will review all applicable FEFs to confirm
        expiration dates used to track required aircrew qualification evaluations are the same
        as those listed in the FEFs. Periodic review of FEFs for personnel in inactive status is
        not required.
        7.8.5.3.2. The interval between reviews will not exceed the standard qualification
        period window unless a more restrictive review period is established by the
        MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        7.8.5.3.3. Document the periodic review IAW MAJCOM and/or unit supplement.
        7.8.5.3.3. (AETC) The stan/eval function will annually review all assigned and
        attached aircrew members’ FEFs. Unit supplement will establish procedures for
        documenting FEF reviews. Note: FEFs of nonpermanent party aircrew members do
        not need to be reviewed.
        7.8.5.3.3. (COLUMBUSAFB) Document the periodic review on the AF Form 942
        IAW Attachment 10.
  7.8.6. FEF Discrepancies. FEF Discrepancies include those of the AF Forms 8/8a, AF
  Forms 4348 (if used), AF Form 942, and any MAJCOM-directed documentation.
     7.8.6.1. Major Discrepancies. Discrepancies that affect the qualification of the affected
     aircrew member.
        7.8.6.1.1. Major discrepancies are documented on a permanent MFR filed in Section
        I or II immediately above the affected AF Forms 8/8a and/or 4348 (if used), or in
        chronological order for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a and/or 4348
        (if used).
        7.8.6.1.2. MFRs documenting similar major discrepancies found on multiple AF
        Forms 8/8a will be filed on top of the latest affected AF Form 8/8a.
     7.8.6.2. Minor Discrepancies. Discrepancies that do not affect the qualification (and/or
     certifications if using the AF Form 4348) of the affected aircrew member (e.g. typos,
     formatting and misspellings).
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012                                             69


        7.8.6.2.1. Minor discrepancies are documented on a non-permanent record as defined
        by the MAJCOM or unit supplement to this instruction and need not reside in the
        FEF.
        7.8.6.2.1. (AETC) Unit supplement will establish procedures for documenting
        minor discrepancies.
        7.8.6.2.1. (COLUMBUSAFB) Each squadron DOV will develop a non-permanent
        record of minor discrepancies to ensure standardization of AF Forms 8, AF Forms
        942, and aircrew member FEFs. Each squadron DOV will place the non-permanent
        record of minor discrepancies on the bottom of the left hand side of the FEF.
     7.8.6.3. Corrections.
        7.8.6.3.1. AF Form 8/8a. As a source document, the AF Form 8/8a may be
        corrected by use of white-out or pen and ink alteration of the original document
        provided the flight examiner signing Section III of the form initials the correction. If
        the original FE is not available then document the discrepancy IAW paragraphs
        7.8.6.1 or 7.8.6.2. When the original FE is not available, OGV Chiefs may also
        correct minor discrepancies as prescribed in MAJCOM supplements.
        7.8.6.3.2. AF Form 942. AF Forms 942, not being source documents, may be altered
        without restriction to reflect the assignment of the affected aircrew member and the
        contents of the FEF.
        7.8.6.3.3. AF Form 4348 (if used). AF Forms 4348 may be corrected by use of
        white-out or pen and ink alteration of the original document provided the certifying
        official signing that line of the AF Form 4348 initials the correction. For significant
        corrections that alter the certification’s intent, make a new AF Form 4348 entry.
        7.8.6.3.4. Electronic Corrections. If the system used to store the record does not
        allow corrections to be made, then document the discrepancy IAW paragraph 7.8.6.1
        and/or paragraph 7.8.6.2.
  7.8.7. Transfer of FEF.
     7.8.7.1. Retention of Records. Retain all records in the FEF until reviewed by the
     gaining unit. After review, return to the individual those forms not retained in the FEF.
     7.8.7.2. Formal Training Graduates. For Formal Training School graduates reporting
     directly to an overseas command for a short tour, retain formal training school records for
     transfer to the subsequent gaining unit.
     7.8.7.3. PCS of Individual. Aircrew members will normally hand-carry their FEF along
     with their FRF to the gaining organization.
        7.8.7.3.1. When circumstances prevent this, the losing organization will mail the
        folder to the gaining unit via registered mail.
        7.8.7.3.2. Mail any records not included in the FEF to the gaining organization with
        clear identification of the individual concerned.
        7.8.7.3.3. When mailing an FEF or any of its contents, retain a copy (hard or soft
        copy is acceptable) until the gaining organization has received the original FEF.

                                          Chapter 8

                                SPECIALIZED AIRCREW

8.1. Purpose. This chapter provides additional guidance pertaining to flight surgeons, Combat
Camera, and non-rated aircrew that only require an examination to establish qualification.
   8.1.1. Initial and periodic qualification consists of a written (open or closed book)
   examination; a flight evaluation is not required. Upon completion of the examination,
   members will be qualified in all USAF aircraft (universal qualification).
   8.1.2. MAJCOMs and subordinate units may direct additional general and/or MDS-Specific
   qualification requirements.
   8.1.2. (AETC) Flight surgeons will complete requirements listed in MDS-specific volumes
   1 for all aircraft in which they will be qualified.
   8.1.3. Qualification requirements will be documented on an AF Form 1522, ARMS
   Additional Training Accomplishment Report, and stored in ARMS in the Formal Training
   module with currency tracked in the Training module. No AF Form 8/8a or FEF is required;
   however, the Stan/Eval function of the unit to which specialized aircrew are
   assigned/attached for flying will verify that ARMS information is logged appropriately.
   When MAJCOMs or subordinate units require a flight phase, or if directed by the applicable
   MDS-Specific Volume 2, document IAW Chapter 7 (to include creating an FEF).
8.2. Evaluations. Initial, periodic, and MDS-Specific (if required) examinations are considered
QUAL evaluations. Other examinations are not required by this AFI, but may be prescribed in
MAJCOM and subordinate unit supplements.
   8.2.1. Flight Surgeons. Test questions will be randomly generated from a test bank
   maintained by AFMOA/SG3P.
   8.2.2. Combat Camera. Test questions will be randomly generated from a test bank
   maintained by the Combat Camera career field manager (CFM), in coordination with HQ
   USAF/A3O-AT and using commands.
   8.2.3. Non-Rated Aircrew Members. Test questions will come from the lead MAJCOM
   Master Question Files (MQFs).

                                           Chapter 9

       ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS (FCIF, SII, GO/NO-GO, SUPPLEMENTARY
                          EVALUATIONS)

9.1. FCIF.
   9.1.1. Units will establish and maintain a library consisting of a current read file and
   publications. This library will consist of a minimum of four volumes as listed in Table 9.1 in
   either hardcopy or electronic format.
   9.1.1. (COLUMBUSAFB) OGV maintains an electronic FCIF publications library for the
   OG. Each flying squadron maintains a master FCIF file for its respective aircraft in a readily
   accessible location within the squadron by the duty desk. A back up of all files will be
   maintained and kept current on each Squadrons external hard-drive provided by OGV.
   9.1.2. FCIFs may be issued to alert crewmembers to publications changes for TOs or AFIs
   that affect aircraft operations, but actual publication changes must be accomplished IAW
   established procedural guidance, to include AFI 33-360 (as applicable) and TO 00-5-1.
   9.1.3. Required Volumes. Volume I is a table of contents for all volumes and current read
   file items, Volumes II through IV are made up of publications and flight manuals, and
   Volume V (optional) is reserved for flight safety information. If units choose hardcopy
   format and the contents of any volume exceed the capacity of its binder, use an additional
   binder and identify the first and subsequent binders by a letter of sequence (e.g., IIIA, IIIB).
   Label binders on the spine indicating Volume and Title as follows:
   9.1.3. (AETC) Rules for establishing and maintaining flight crew information file (FCIF)
   volumes are as follows:
      9.1.3.1. (Added-AETC) At a minimum, each flying squadron will maintain an FCIF
      functional publication library and appoint, in writing, an FCIF monitor to ensure proper
      maintenance as directed by this supplement. The OG/OGV is responsible for FCIF
      standardization for subordinate flying organizations and is the focal point for any data to
      be entered in the FCIF. The OG/OGV may maintain a web-based FCIF resource, but is
      still required to notify subordinate units of new items. To avoid overwhelming
      crewmembers with unnecessary details, prominent points should be extracted from
      lengthy documents or highlighted if inclusion in Volume I, is necessary. Above the
      OG/OGV level, HQ AETC/A3F is the focal point for FCIF information. HQ AFRC/A3V
      is the focal point for AFRC units.
      9.1.3.2. (Added-AETC) The stan/eval office of the unit maintaining the FCIF volumes
      will prepare an AETC Form 1138, Flight Crew Information File Record of Review, for
      each assigned or attached crewmember, to include students. Local forms developed as a
      substitute for the AETC Form 1138 must be approved by HQ AETC/A3FV before use.
      An electronic database or other signoff record may be used in lieu of the AETC Form
      1138 as long as it captures the same information. Note: Throughout this publication, the
      term “FCIF signoff record” includes the AETC Form 1138, a locally proposed substitute
      and an electronic method.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012                                              73


     9.1.3.3. (Added-AETC) Annotate reviews of the appropriate FCIF volumes on the
     FCIF signoff record. Initial reviews will be accomplished prior to an individual’s first
     flight. An annual review will also be accomplished prior to the first flight at the
     beginning of each calendar year. The first line entry on a new FCIF signoff record will be
     the latest FCIF item current on the date of review. Crewmembers will enter the index
     number for the latest items and then initial and date the FCIF signoff record. Prior to each
     flight, update the FCIF signoff record if new material was added since the last review.
     Key staff personnel without a unit-maintained FCIF signoff record and crewmembers not
     assigned or attached to that unit will annotate the FCIF number and initial next to their
     name on the original copy of the flight authorization. The unit’s go/no-go program will
     track compliance with this paragraph. Electronic signoff methods must have controls in
     place to ensure go/no-go requirements are met.
     9.1.3.4. (Added-AETC) Aircrew members authorized to join a mission en route may
     participate as primary aircrew members if they receive an FCIF update from a qualified
     and current crewmember (preferably a counterpart) on that mission.
     9.1.3.5. (Added-AETC) Brief applicable FCIF items prior to flight.

   9.1.4. Current Read File. Volume I consists of a minimum of two parts to include an Index
   (Part A) and Current Read Files (Parts B and C (Note: Part C is optional)). MAJCOMs may
   add additional components to Volume I as appropriate.
   9.1.4. (AETC) Current Read File. In addition to Part A and Part B, units will also
   maintain Part C.
      9.1.4.1. Part A is a table of contents listing all material contained in FCIF Volumes I
      through V.
      9.1.4.1. (AETC) Part A will contain the appointment memorandum for the FCIF
      monitor.
      9.1.4.2. Part B is the Current Read File of FCIF messages. Messages contain information
      temporary in nature, directly pertinent to the safe conduct of flight, and must be read
      before flight. FCIFs that contain aircraft-related information will be forwarded to all
      using MAJCOMs.
      9.1.4.2. (AETC) AETC aircrews tasked with operational missions will review the
      tasking MAJCOM’s Part B read file.
      9.1.4.3. Part C is the Current Read File that contains information temporary in nature but
      not related to the safe conduct of flight and not required to be read before flight.
      9.1.4.3. (AETC) Part C, General Information, will be maintained and include current
      operational and mission guidance of a nonsafety flight nature. Note: Part C guidance is
      not part of the flight go/no-go program. Units will implement procedures to ensure
      aircrews read and acknowledge items in Part C in a timely manner. Command-level Part
      C items may be upgraded to Part B by local units.
          9.1.4.3.1. (Added-AETC) At the OG/CC’s discretion, Part C may include a flight
          crew bulletin (FCB), which contains items of interest extracted from publications,
          directives, messages, etc., not normally available to crewmembers. The FCB may also
          include consolidated Part C items for long-term reference. Active Part B items may
          not be published in the FCB. However, expired or rescinded Part B items may be
          continued in the FCB when the item, although no longer a safety-of-flight issue,
          remains useful and valid in the judgment of the OG/CC or OGV. If FCBs are used,
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012                                              75


         publish, at a minimum, on a semiannual basis. FCB items will cite the authority for
         inclusion. Structure and format of the FCB will be defined in the unit supplement.
      9.1.4.4. Squadrons with both primary crewmembers and mission crewmembers may use
      separate sections in Volume I for mission crewmembers. In addition, these squadrons are
      exempt from the requirement to maintain mission crewmember checklist and aircrew aids
      in the FCIF volumes.
      9.1.4.5. Refer to Attachment 7 for a sample FCIF format.
      9.1.4.6. (Added-AETC) Use AETC Form 446, Flight Crew Information File, as the
      first page for each Part B or C entry. The entry may include attachments or continuation
      sheets.
      9.1.4.7. (Added-AETC) Conduct quarterly reviews of Part B, and C read files. Begin
      Part B and C with a numerical index of current information that includes the assigned HQ
      AETC or OG/OGV control number, date distributed, latest review date, title, OPR, date
      rescinded, and disposition. The review date may be left blank for newly filed items that
      have not been subject to review. File items in Part B and C in reverse numerical sequence
      with the latest item on top. Maintain command-level items until rescinded by the issuing
      agency. Maintain rescinded items in a separate file for 6 months according to the AF
      RDS located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/ and continue to
      reference them on the index until the end of the quarter following the quarter in which the
      item was rescinded. Cross-reference classified entries to the location where the item is
      maintained.
   9.1.5. Publications Library. Volumes II through IV will consist of an FCIF Functional
   Publications Library according to MAJCOM directives. See AFI 33-360 for basic library
   requirements.
      9.1.5.1. All publications in the library will be current and complete. MAJCOMs may
      authorize units to withhold posting of information that does not apply based on aircraft
      configuration.
      9.1.5.2. Units will establish and maintain a table of contents for the publications library
      containing, as a minimum, a listing of basic publications numbers and short titles.
      Publication dates, supplements and changes are not required.
      9.1.5.2. (COLUMBUSAFB) In addition to the publications listed in AFI11-
      202V2_AETCSUP, units will maintain, as a minimum, a table of contents of the
      directives shown in Table 9.2. Squadron publications officers will maintain one paper set
      of required MDS technical orders, MDS technical order checklist(s) and an in-flight
      guide. Squadrons will ensure that all IPs and students have access to, as a minimum, the
      publications listed in the master FCIF file in AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP, and this
      supplement. Each IP and student will maintain their own technical order checklist(s) and

9.2. Flight Related SII.
     9.2.1. Flight Related SIIs are items of emphasis relating to existing procedure(s) designed to
     mitigate or eliminate specific risks or trends.
        9.2.1.1. SIIs do not add to or amend established procedures (reference guidance on
        issuing FCIFs in paragraph 9.1, above).
        9.2.1.2. SIIs will be based on analysis of risks and trends from a variety of sources to
        include Safety Investigation Board (SIB) findings/recommendations, safety related
        incidences, trend analysis, deployed area of operations and potential problems with
        equipment/procedures.
     9.2.2. SII(s) will be issued through the same process used to release FCIFs with the
     following elements:
        9.2.2.1. Specific MDS applicability
        9.2.2.2. References (document, SIB, etc)
        9.2.2.3. Risk factors and trend details
        9.2.2.4. Specific emphasis actions to reduce/eliminate the risk or trend that generated the
        SII.

        9.2.2.6. SME/POC for further information
     9.2.3. SII(s) will be of limited duration (generally not to exceed 90 days).
     9.2.4. SII(s) may be issued/rescinded from the HAF, MAJCOM, NAF or unit level. If issued
     from agencies outside the MAJCOMs (e.g. HAF, HQ AFFSA, but not subordinate NAFs or
     units), the lead MAJCOM stan/eval function will coordinate the intent and verbiage of the
     SII with other MAJCOM stan/eval functions in order to determine the level of applicability
     within the individual MAJCOMs prior to release.
     9.2.4. (AETC) NAF/DO(A3) will issue and rescind NAF SIIs.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012                                                79


   9.2.5. Units will place all applicable SIIs into the FCIF, Current Read File, Part B, for
   dissemination to crewmembers.
   9.2.6. All current MDS-Specific and CRM/ORM related SII(s) will be briefed during flight
   briefings for the duration of the SII(s). Mission-specific SII(s) need only be briefed on those
   missions for which the SII is relevant.
9.3. Go/No-Go Procedures. Units will establish a positive control system that ensures aircrew
members have completed all ground training and Stan/Eval items required for flight. Units will
provide guidance on this system in the unit supplement.
9.3. (COLUMBUSAFB)Prior to step, Ops Sup, duty officer, or squadron aviation resource
management (SARM) personnel will verify each aircrew is current for all missions and events
they will accomplish using ARMS or TIMS go-no-go (GNG) display as applicable. If an aircrew
is non-current according to the GNG display, aircrew will verify using source documentation that
the mission or event was accomplished. Ops Sups will check currency-based ground duties, such
as RSU, SOF and Ops Sup, prior to the crews accomplishing the duty. For off-station sorties,
prior to departure, all aircrew will ensure currencies will not expire before the completion of the
temporary duty (TDY). Weekend Ops Sups will immediately notify command post of any GNG
requirements affecting off-station aircrew during their TDY. The Ops Sup will leave a message
with command post and try to call the affected crews using their contact information in the 14
FTW cross country tracker. While off-station, aircrew will contact the Ops Sup or command
post to check for any messages regarding GNG.
9.3. (AETC) Go/No-Go Procedures. The OGV will develop procedures required for the
go/no-go program and ensure the information is available to, and reviewed by, aircrews away
from their home station.
   9.3.1. As a minimum, the Go/No Go system will monitor:
       9.3.1.1. Form 8/8a qualification or appropriate ARMS products.
       9.3.1.1. (COLUMBUSAFB) The primary means of monitoring this currency will be
       TIMS. The backup system will be ARMS products, LOXs, or individual FEFs.
       9.3.1.2. Ground and flight currency items required for flight IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 1,
       AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1, and AFI 11-421 Aviation Resource Management.
       9.3.1.2. (COLUMBUSAFB) The primary means of monitoring this currency will be
       TIMS. Backup system will be ARMS products, individual training summaries, or a
       signed AF Form 1522.
           9.3.1.2.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Aircrew will complete a boldface on the first
           day (or flight day) of the month. IPs and students can complete their boldface using
           TIMS.
       9.3.1.3. Examination items required for flight from this AFI and applicable supplements
       (see Chapter 6).
       9.3.1.3. (COLUMBUSAFB) The primary means of monitoring this currency will be
       TIMS.
           9.3.1.3.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The instrument refresher program is a
           grounding item for all 14 OG aircrew.

     9.3.1.4. Any Duty Not Involving Flying (DNIF) status.
        9.3.1.4.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) When a student or pilot goes on or off DNIF
        status, the flight surgeon will complete AF Form 1042. One copy of the AF Form
        1042 will be handed to the individual, one placed in the patient’s record, and another
        copy will go to flight surgeon office (FSO) administration. The flight surgeon’s
        office will fax or email all AF Forms 1042 after sick call is completed (approximately
        0900L and 1500L) to the host aviation resource management (HARM) office. The
        HARM office will update DNIF status in ARMS once they receive the AF Form
        1042, and they will file the AF Forms 1042 as required. For students, the flight
        surgeon will complete a AF Form 4293, Student Activity Record for on or off status in
        TIMS as required. The FSO will also update the DNIF duty status in TIMS for all
        students. For permanent party pilots the HARM office will ensure the squadron
        SARM office is notified and DNIF status updated in TIMS.

9.4. Supplementary Evaluations.
9.4. (AETC)Supplementary Evaluations. The unit supplementary evaluation program will be
defined in a unit supplement. Areas subject to supplementary evaluations are, at a minimum, unit
operational procedures, training programs and SEFE quality force. The effectiveness of these
programs and others, as defined by the unit commander, is the primary objective of
supplementary evaluations.
9.4. (COLUMBUSAFB)OGV will conduct a supplementary evaluation, as directed by the
OG/CC. Emphasis will be on ensuring compliance to command, NAF, wing, group, and
squadron directives. Following the inspection, a formal out brief will be conducted with the
OG/CC and unit commander. OGV will write the inspection report and distribute it to all
applicable OG units. The inspected unit will reply to all findings within 30 days. OGV will
conduct a follow-up inspection of all observations and findings 45-60 days after the inspection.
OGV may also conduct informal inspections of OG units and debrief OG/CC on the results.
   9.4.1. Purpose. Supplementary evaluations are administrative tools used by a commander to
   ensure standardization of operations and to identify and evaluate implemented solutions to
   operational problems, such as negative checkride trends. The form and content of a
   supplementary evaluation is at the discretion of the commander directing it.
   9.4.2. Supplementary evaluations are not aircrew qualification evaluations.
   9.4.3. The commander directing the supplementary evaluation will determine the areas to be
   evaluated. The Stan/Eval function directly under the commander directing the supplementary
   evaluation will determine the method of evaluation, is responsible for administrative
   management of data collection, and will report results as directed by the commander.
   9.4.4. Individuals other than flight examiners, as determined by the commander directing the
   supplementary evaluation, may participate in its conduct.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012                                                83


   9.4.5. Supplementary evaluations may be administered in conjunction with a flight
   evaluation. If conducted in-flight, supplementary evaluations will not be all-encompassing,
   result in the assignment of an overall grade or be documented on an AF Form 8/8a.
   9.4.6. At a minimum, supplementary evaluations results will be documented in SEB minutes
   (see Attachment 2).
   9.4.7. (Added-AETC) SEFE Objectivity Evaluations (optional). As required, conduct an
   evaluation of the objectivity and skill of a lower echelon flight examiner in administering an
   evaluation. Overall rating for this type of an evaluation is either qualified (1) or unqualified
   (3). Use the grading criteria in Attachment 9 (Added) as follows:
       9.4.7.1. (Added-AETC) A qualified rating (1) indicates that the flight examiner
       examinee complied with HHQ and local stan/eval directives, properly briefed and
       debriefed the examinee, correctly identified discrepancies, awarded the correct grade for
       each evaluated area, awarded the appropriate overall grade and, if required, assigned
       appropriate additional training.
       9.4.7.2. (Added-AETC) An unqualified rating (3) is awarded when, in the higher level
       flight examiner's judgment, the lower level flight examiner failed to satisfy the
       requirements of paragraph 9.4.7.1. (Added). The unit SQ/CC or OG/CC, as applicable,
       determines the flight examiner certification status of the SEFE receiving an unqualified
       objectivity evaluation. If decertified, document the decertification on the SEFE’s AF
       Form 4348. (Exception: ARC units need not use AF Form 4348.) If the failure requires
       downgrading the SEFE from IP status, use the commander-directed downgrade
       procedures.

A8.3. Rating System:
   A8.3.1. Stan/eval programs will receive a five-tier rating according to AFI 90-201, Inspector
   General Activities. Only members of the MAJCOM or NAF stan/eval chain of command
   may assess ratings to items inspected by this attachment. The overall grade for the squadron
   program will not be higher than Satisfactory if any squadron program is rated Unsatisfactory.
   The overall grade for the OGV program will not be higher than Satisfactory if any OGV
   program is rated Unsatisfactory. SEFE manning at the OGV and squadron level will be
   evaluated on a two-tier rating (Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory).
   A8.3.2. Except where noted in paragraph A8.3.1. (Added), ratings are based on a five-tier
   rating as follows:
       A8.3.2.1. Outstanding (O). Performance or operation far exceeds mission
       requirements. Procedures and activities are carried out in a far superior manner.
       Resources and programs are very efficiently managed and are of exceptional merit. Few,
       if any, deficiencies exist.
       A8.3.2.2. Excellent (E). Performance or operation exceeds mission requirements.
       Procedures and activities are carried out in a superior manner. Resources and programs
       are very efficiently managed and relatively free of deficiencies.
       A8.3.2.3. Satisfactory (S). Performance or operation meets mission requirements.
       Procedures and activities are carried out in an effective and competent manner. Resources
       and programs are efficiently managed. Minor deficiencies may exist, but do not impede
       or limit mission accomplishment.
       A8.3.2.4. Marginal (M). Performance or operation does not meet some mission
       requirements. Procedures and activities are not carried out in an efficient manner.
       Resources and programs are not efficiently managed. Deficiencies exist that impede or
       limit mission accomplishment.
       A8.3.2.5. Unsatisfactory (U). Performance or operation does not meet mission
       requirements. Procedures and activities are not carried out in an adequate manner.
       Resources and programs are not adequately managed. Significant deficiencies exist that
       prevent or seriously limit mission accomplishment or endanger personnel or resources.
A8.4. Flying-Related SIIs. SIIs are established to focus attention on operations- related areas
and will be evaluated during formal visits. Compliance will be evaluated on a two-tier rating
(Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory).
A8.5. Evaluating Leadership and Representative Sample. All commanders, to include WG,
OG, and SQ level, will receive evaluations along with a representative sample of supervisors,
instructors, and line aircrews. Crewmembers maintaining multiple currencies will be subject to
evaluations in either an aircraft or a crew position.
A8.6. Trend Analysis. ASEV teams will not report trends. Discrepancies noted will be
reported to the unit's OGV for trend analysis.
A8.7. Team Chief Responsibilities. Each team chief will:
   A8.7.1. Formally in-brief the OG/CC and staff.
AFI11-202V2_AETCSUP_COLUMBUSAFBSUP_I 7 JUNE 2012                                            109


  A8.7.2. Plan the number and types of evaluations to be conducted as well as which
  individuals will be evaluated. (Note: A cross-section of supervisors and experienced and
  inexperienced crewmembers will be evaluated.) In addition:
     A8.7.2.1. To support the formal evaluations, selected crewmembers may be designated
     to augment the NAF stan/eval inspection team. Their duties will be limited to
     administering permanent party evaluations under NAF supervision or oversight.
     A8.7.2.2. Evaluations may include scheduled, no-notice, spot, and supplementary (SEFE
     objectivity). Most evaluations will include a ground and flight evaluation. As soon as
     practical following the evaluations, crewmembers and the squadron commander or
     designated representative will be debriefed on their status (qualified or unqualified) and
     advised of any required additional training.
     A8.7.2.3. The full flight evaluation profile should be planned by the examinee unless the
     profile is a student training sortie. In that event, the student may plan the sortie. These
     evaluations will constitute an evaluation of the examinee and the unit's flight evaluation
     profiles.
     A8.7.2.4. Evaluations will be administered to individuals by notifying the unit at an
     appropriate time (if the individual is already scheduled) or by requesting an individual be
     added to the next day’s schedule for this purpose.
     A8.7.2.5. Administrative support for all flight evaluations will be provided by the
     operations group (the flight for the 36 RQF).
     A8.7.2.6. Aircrew testing will be conducted for all qualified crewmembers. The test will
     normally consist of a total of 50 questions, with 30 questions coming from the MQF and
     20 questions covering general knowledge and aircraft operational limits. In addition,
     permanent party aircrew members will complete a boldface or CAP test.
         A8.7.2.6.1. The minimum passing grade for the combined MQF, general knowledge,
         and operational limits test is 85 percent and 100 percent for the boldface or CAP test.
         A8.7.2.6.2. Aircrew test or examination failures will result in grounding until the
         crewmember passes a re-examination. The examinee must be afforded adequate study
         time prior to reexamination.

                                    FEF PROCEDURES

A10.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) The format of the entries on the AF Form 942 may vary
depending on the version of the form used. Units are expected to use new forms as they become
available. For example, the date completed block on AF Form 942 EF-V3 must be completed
with YYYYMMDD for the software to support it. Consequently, the entry does not match the
example given in the basic instruction but it is still acceptable. If data is transcribed to an
electronic version of the AF Form 942, it must be done accurately—thus no requirement to
archive old hard-copies.
A10.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Units will accomplish an initial review of the FEF for
newly assigned aircrew. This review will satisfy the requirements of an annual review and the
member’s FEF must be reviewed again within 12 months. Completion of the initial review will
be documented by entering “Assigned 14 FTW” on the appropriate line of the AF Form 942 with
a date completed. Subsequent annual reviews will be documented by “Annual Review” being
entered.
A10.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) When receiving an FEF from PIT, ensure the INIT QUAL
evaluation or any RQ evaluations, the INIT INSTR/MSN evaluation, and the one line MAJCOM
change entry (when appropriate) are entered prior to entering “Assigned 14 FTW” on the AF
Form 942.

The following are useful when describing the “EFFECT” of the error:
asymmetrical/unsymmetrical (maneuver)
delayed (entry)
fast (final approach)
firm (touchdown)
rushed (descent)
unnecessary (acceleration)

Table A13.5. (Added) Q- write-ups.
EXAMPLES OF WRITE-UPS FOR Q- PERFORMANCE
ILS                 Inattention to heading resulted in significant course deviations
                    A substantial delay in making the decision to eject unnecessarily
EMERGENCY           prolonged an emergency situation
PROCEDURES          A substantial delay in securing an engine after an in-flight failure
                    prolonged an emergency situation
                    Shallow descent on final resulted in late arrival to the minimum
                    descent altitude (MDA) and difficulty complying with landing
VOR/TACAN
                    instructions. (Cause with compound effects shows limited
                    proficiency.)
NO FLAP
                    A very early power reduction and incomplete flare resulted in a
PATTERN/LANDING
                    firm touchdown. (Multiple causes show limited proficiency.)
(OVHD)
NO FLAP             High power setting and steep glide path resulted in a fast
PATTERN/LANDING     threshold speed and a long touchdown. (Multiple causes show
(ST-IN)             limited proficiency.)
                    Poor checklist discipline resulted in significant delays
                    accomplishing the before landing check, the 1600-1700 lbs fuel
INFLIGHT CHECKS     check, and the operations check. (Compound effects show
                    limited proficiency.)
                    Poor checklist usage resulted in deleting several cleanup items.

                           landing check. (Compound effects show limited proficiency.)
                           Incomplete reference to published approach minimums resulted
LOCALIZER                  in a level off at an inappropriate altitude. (The navigation
                           equipment permitted a lower MDA.)

Note:
1. Maneuvers in the profiles count toward the required maneuvers. For example, if your profile
has a non-precision single-engine approach required, you do not have to do another non-
precision approach. A missed approach or SE missed approach will count as the requirement for
both (only perform one missed approach).
2. Traffic pattern stall – at a minimum, perform a turning and a landing attitude stall.
3. Instruction during instrument maneuvers is not mandatory; however instruction is required on

other transition maneuvers. The evaluator may fly non-instrument maneuvers to evaluate
grading practices.
4. The evaluator can change the profile at their discretion to meet operational constraints.
However, all required maneuvers must normally be accomplished to complete the evaluation.
Specific evaluation criteria for T-1 instructors can be found in AFI11-2T-1V2.

A17.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Squadron Quality of Force (QOF) Program.
  A17.1.1. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) 50 FTS will support the 14 OGV QOF program by
  sampling all IP experience levels and positions. The 50 FTS QOF program will ensure that
  all levels of IP experience will be sampled through the following plan.
  A17.1.2. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) A goal of 4 (1 per quarter) QOF evaluations will be
  conducted each year by the SQ/CC and/or the SQ/DO. These evaluations will be aligned
  with the 50 FTS/DOV snapshot program and will target the following IPs to ensure a cross-
  section of experience levels: 1 squadron supervisor, 1 first assignment IP (FAIP), 1 line IP
  with major weapon system (MWS) experience, and 1 reservist IP. Additionally, these
  evaluations should be split evenly between MSN and INSTM/QUAL type sorties.
  A17.1.3. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) In addition to this yearly plan, each newly assigned
  IP may be identified for a future QOF evaluation through the review of training records,
  flying records, mission qualification training (MQT), and/or supervisory flights by squadron
  supervisors.
  A17.1.4. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) Additionally, the 50 FTS QOF program will attempt
  to target any IP for-cause.
  A17.1.5. (Added-COLUMBUSAFB) 50 FTS/DOV will track, schedule, and coordinate the
  50 FTS QOF program with the SQ/CC to ensure these goals are accomplished.
