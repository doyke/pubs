        2.3.1.4. Status of Shelter in Place program.
        2.3.1.5. Meeting with the unit commander will be documented on the unit quarterly
        report.
     2.3.2. Unit EM Representatives will maintain the following documents and review them
     annually and upon changes, revisions, or updates. Paper or electronic copy of publications
     and documents is an acceptable format and the utilization of a cross reference sheet is
     acceptable; however, the cross reference sheet must reference a location within the office
     such as a book case, compact disk or other location that does not require on-line access.
        2.3.2.1. AFI 10-2501, AFMAN 10-2502, AFMAN 10-2602.
        2.3.2.2. The 45 SW CEMP 10-2, Vol 1 (PAFB and/or CCAFS as appropriate).
        2.3.2.3. EM information program pamphlets and/or handouts for managing unit EM
        program to include the following:
            2.3.2.3.1. The 45 SW SIP Guide.
            2.3.2.3.2. The 45 SW Hurricane Guide.
            2.3.2.3.3. The 45 CES/CEX Quarterly Newsletter.
            2.3.2.3.4. The 45 SW Family Disaster Planning Guide.
     2.3.3. Unit EM Quarterly Report. Unit EM Representatives will submit reports quarterly.
     The format will be provided by 45 CES/CEX. Reports are due by the 10th of Jan, Apr, Jul,
     and Oct and will reflect the status of the unit EM Program as of the last day of the quarter.
     The unit commander or staff agency chief will sign the report. Quarterly Reports will take
     the place of all EM appointment letters. When significant changes occur within a unit an
     Interim report should be prepared and the word ―Interim‖ will be placed in the reporting
     period block. An Interim report should still be a complete report.
2.4. Unit Implementing Checklists. Units assigned to the 45 SW will develop and maintain
checklists to support emergency responses as specified in 45 SW Comprehensive Emergency
Management Plan 10-2, Volume 1, and this instruction. Checklists will be reviewed and
reaccomplished within 30 days after a new 45 SW CEMP 10-2, Volume 1, is published.
45 CES/CEX will review these checklists prior to implementation. Unit EM Representatives
will ensure functional experts review checklists at least annually and upon changes in unit
tasking or source documents. Unit EM Representatives will document the review dates and
forward a copy of the review, to include any changes to 45 CES/CEX.
2.5. Unit Information Program. The purpose of a unit information program is to ensure all
unit personnel receive current EM information. Unit personnel with family members are
responsible to inform their families on local conditions and other information to react to
emergencies or disasters that might affect the family if the military spouse is not available. The
Readiness and Emergency Management office distributes information and the Unit EM
Representatives can supplement the information to address unit specific requirements. Units will
do the following:
     2.5.1. Provide a unit EM briefing within 30 days of members’ assignment to the unit.
     2.5.2. Brief the following topics annually using briefings or read files:

   2.5.3. Document all training conducted and maintain in the Unit EM Quarterly Report in the
   appropriate block (e.g., information presented, date, and number of personnel trained and
   dissemination method).
2.6. Unit Control Centers. Unit Control Centers (UCCs) support EM operations and are
responsible for dispatching and controlling unit resources during contingency operations. UCCs
are required for all organizations tasked to provide EOC representation and will be activated
when the EOC is recalled. UCCs must remain in 24-hour operation until termination of the
emergency or until released by the Installation Commander. Each control center must have a
primary and alternate location identified with telephone numbers and provide 45 CES/CEX with
this information.
   2.6.1. Unit Control Centers will maintain the following:
       2.6.1.1. Unit specific checklists that address unit operations during major accidents,
       natural disasters, and terrorist incidents involving CBRNE, shelter in place, relocation
       plus activation and deactivation of the unit control center.
       2.6.1.2. Communications capabilities necessary to support tasked mission requirements
       (e.g., cell phone, radio, etc.). All 45 SW units will also maintain the ability to log into the
       wing contingency software (currently Shark C2).
       2.6.1.3. Listing of unit facilities, with primary and alternate phone numbers of personnel
       to be notified for each main occupied facility or a method of notifying all unit personnel.
       This will also be used during shelter in place operations.
       2.6.1.4. Recall Rosters of key personnel and specialized teams. EOC and specialized
       team rosters will be separate from the squadron recall or other rosters.
       2.6.1.5. Procedures to activate emergency power and lighting.
       2.6.1.6. Log of Events, to record information and response actions.
       2.6.1.7. Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) maps with unit work centers, unit
       control centers, and shelters highlighted. Maps will be obtained from 45 CES/CEX.
       2.6.1.8. Highway and Road Maps or Topographical Maps of the state and local area.
2.7. Unit Emergency Management Binder. All units identified in Table 2.1 will prepare a unit
Emergency Management Continuity Binder using Table 2.2 (below) as a guideline.

                                           Chapter 5

                          DISASTER RESPONSE FORCE TEAMS

5.1. Purpose. Disaster Response Force (DRF) teams are formed from existing base resources to
support disaster and contingency operations. 45 SW is responsible for supporting all Air Force
resources in areas of Florida that may be up to and exceed a 150-mile radius depending on the
situation and the neighboring installation capabilities. Predefined response areas are outlined in
45 SW CEMP 10-2, Volume I and have been coordinated with MacDill AFB and Homestead
ARB; however, a response could be in support of, or in lieu of, a response from the closest
military installation as directed by higher authority.
5.2. Specialized DRF Teams.
   5.2.1. Contamination Control Teams (CCT). These teams support in-garrison peacetime
   CBRN incident requirements.
   5.2.2. Readiness Support Team (RST). The RST augments the Readiness and Emergency
   Management office. RST members work with the R & EM office and perform selected and
   critical operational tasks where staffing is insufficient. RST operations will include, but are
   not limited to, performing CBRNE monitoring, contamination control station (CCS)
   operations, CBRN control center tasks, Emergency Operations Center support and
   responding to a full spectrum of incidents/accident/disasters to include exercises and training.
   Units tasked to appoint personnel to the RST must ensure personnel appointed meet the
   following minimum requirements:
       5.2.2.1. Every effort will be made to prevent RST members from having any conflicting
       duties that would restrict emergency response duties. Since Resource Augmentation
       Duty (READY) personnel can be assigned or subject to a deployable unit type code, they
       may not be available to respond to RST. Every effort should be made to ensure they are
       available.
       5.2.2.2. Personnel assigned to the RST will not be replaced for reasons other than PCS,
       retirement, separation, or medical disqualification without sufficient justification signed
       by the unit commander. The tasked unit will fill the projected vacancy within 30 days of
       notification.
       5.2.2.3. Personnel assigned to the RST will respond to the R & EM office, Bldg 710,
       when recalled. Response time will be 30 minutes during duty hours and 90 minutes
       during off duty hours.
   5.2.3. Emergency Operations Center (EOC). The EOC is a peacetime disaster command,
   control, and communications element that provides functional support and expertise to an
   Incident Commander (IC). It coordinates operations and support requirements with the base
   and provides liaison with civil authorities and response elements, directs and coordinates the
   activities of organizational resources, coordinates functional support with their unit control
   center, coordinates with civilian counterparts, advises the IC and provides timely updates to
   45 SW Leadership on the Crisis Action Team.
   5.2.4. Shelter Management Teams (SMT). SMTs will be used to protect personnel during
   major accidents natural disasters, or terrorist use of CBRNE agents. Shelter Management
45SWI10-2501     24 FEBRUARY 2011                                                            15


   Teams are under the control of unit commanders but will receive training as requested or
   required by the R & EM office. All primary occupancy facilities in the 45 SW should have
   personnel familiar with Shelter in Place procedures.
   5.2.5. Hurricane Recovery Team (HRT). The HRT is formed from organizations
   throughout the 45 SW. Both PAFB and CCAFS will have a HRT formed every year prior to
   the onset of the official hurricane season (1 June – 30 November). The purpose of the HRT
   is to provide an initial survey of the base after a hurricane and to begin restoration of
   essential base functions such as water, sewer, electric and other necessary functions.
   5.2.6. Hurricane Evacuation Site Staff (HESS). The HESS is a specialized version of a
   SMT which deploys to the designated Hurricane Evacuation Site (currently Space Coast
   Junior Senior High School in Port Saint John) to receive students from the Defense Equal
   Opportunity Management Institute and any other 45 SW personnel and their dependents who
   have no other evacuation options. The HESS Commander is appointed by the 45 SW Vice
   Commander. The HESS commander will in turn ensure HESS team members are formed
   and trained prior to 1 June ever year.
5.3. Policy.
   5.3.1. Unit commanders/staff agency chiefs will appoint specialized team members using the
   Unit Emergency Management Quarterly Report.
       5.3.1.1. Team members will meet all requirements and will be trained IAW prescribed
       directives.
       5.3.1.2. Team duties will become the appointee’s primary duty during training, exercises,
       contingencies and emergencies.
       5.3.1.3. SMT, CCT and RST members, tasked from outside the owner unit, will be
       identified through the Augmentation Program IAW AFI 10-217, Resource Augmentation
       Duty Program.
       5.3.1.4. Unit commanders or staff agency chiefs will make every effort to ensure
       personnel assigned to DRF duties do not have any conflicting wartime or contingency
       duties.
       5.3.1.5. Personnel assigned to DRF teams should not be routinely replaced or reassigned.
       Once a trained member is identified for PCS, retirement or separation, a replacement
       must be identified as soon as possible, but not later than 60 days prior to the trained
       member’s PCS, retirement or separation date.
5.4. Team Composition.
   5.4.1. Contamination Control Teams. Teams will be staffed for 24-hour operations. As a
   minimum, each team will consist of a primary and alternate team chief. These team chiefs
   will be trained in decontamination principles and procedures by 45 CES/CEX. The tasked
   unit commanders will determine the number of team members necessary. Team chiefs will
   train all additional team members.
   5.4.2. Emergency Operations Center. Primary and alternate EOC representatives will be
   assigned by the organization commander, will be functional experts and will be delegated
   with the same authority as the organization commander or staff agency chief.

  5.4.3. Readiness Support Team (RST). The READY Program will identify wing
  personnel to perform RST duties. RST members will be trained and equipped by the R &
  EM Flight.
  5.4.4. Shelter Management Teams (SMTs). Minimum team size for emergency operations
  is one shelter supervisor and one assistant per shift.
  5.4.5. Hurricane Recovery Team (HRT). For Patrick AFB the members of the HRT are
  listed in Tab D to Appendix 6 to Annex B of the 45 SW CEMP 10-2, Volume 1, PAFB. For
  CCAFS the members of the HRT are listed in Tab B to Appendix 6 to Annex B of the 45 SW
  CEMP 10-2, Volume 1, CCAFS.
  5.4.6. Hurricane Evacuation Site Staff (HESS). HESS members are listed in Tab E to
  Appendix 6 to Annex B of the CEMP 10-2 Volume 1, PAFB.
