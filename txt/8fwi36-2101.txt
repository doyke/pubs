This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-21, Utilization and
Classification of Air Force Military Personnel. This instruction outlines military personnel
strength accounting methods and procedures for 8th Fighter Wing base-wide recalls. It
establishes policies and principles for recalls and personnel strength accounting. It contains rules
and procedures for computing and reporting personnel strength, recalling individuals on leave or
TDY, and documenting duty status changes. It implements procedures for the use of the Theater
Battle Management Core System (TBMCS). It also utilizes the 8 FW IMT 6, Personnel
Accountability Worksheet. Refer recommended changes and questions about this instruction to
the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication. Route the AF Form 847 from the appropriate units, to the OPR (8 FSS/FSOXI).
Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of
in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims.          This instruction is applicable to all
personnel assigned, attached or associated units to the 8th Fighter Wing, Kunsan Air Base,
Republic of Korea.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This is especially true
with the recent merger of 8 MSS and 8 SVS into a 8th Force Support Squadron or 8 FSS. All
previous references to 8 MSS will now be to 8 FSS. Additionally, with the dissolution of
Commander’s Support Staffs and the termination of use of PC-III, all duty status and leave info
2                                                               8FWI36-2101 25 AUGUST 2009


will now be retrieved via the Base Level Service Delivery Model, or BLSDM. All other changes
are related to nomenclature only, i.e., Survival Recovery Center to Emergency Operations Center
(EOC), etc.
1. Responsibilities.
    1.1. The 8th Fighter Wing Command Post (8 FW/CP) will initiate a base-wide recall IAW 8
    FWI 10-401, Pyramid Recall System (PRS), when directed by the 8th Fighter Wing
    Commander (8 FW/CC) or his/her designated alternate. The following commanders are
    identified as 8 FW/CC alternates: 8th Fighter Wing Vice Commander (8 FW/CV), 8th
    Operations Group Commander (8 OG/CC), 8th Maintenance Group Commander (8
    MXG/CC), 8th Mission Support Group Commander (8 MSG/CC), or 8th Medical Group
    Commander (8 MDG/CC).
    1.2. Upon initiation of a recall, commanders should state the minimum amount of
    information necessary to expedite the notification process. Explanations concerning the
    purpose of the recall should not be provided to those being recalled.
       1.2.1. The pyramid recall approach is the primary means to contact unit personnel.
       Personnel who cannot be contacted are reported as ―not contacted.‖ Contact will
       continue with the next individual in the chain until all personnel are notified of the recall.
2. Procedures.
    2.1. Telephone Standby Procedures:
       2.1.1. Telephone standby is used to improve the overall alert posture and response time
       of the 8 FW. Telephone standby procedures are initiated at the direction of the 8 FW/CC
       or 8 FW/CV. Personnel on leave or TDY are not placed on telephone standby unless
       directed by the appropriate authority.
       2.1.2. Unit Control Centers (UCC) will classify personnel who cannot be reasonably
       contacted during a recall as being in a ―not contacted‖ status.
    2.2. Communication Outage (Comm-Out) Recall Procedures:
       2.2.1. The possible loss of all normal communication during a natural disaster,
       equipment failure, or sabotage necessitates preparing another means for recalling
       personnel under comm-out conditions. Since the nature of the comm-out may not be
       readily available, the worst-case scenario should always be assumed.
       2.2.2. Squadrons should consider the following when developing comm-out procedures:
       Notification system should be based on geographic location. Emphasize early
       notification of key personnel. Identify a method to contact the largest number of
       personnel, in the shortest amount of time, versus the need for obtaining capability in
       critical areas. Latest versions of hard copy recall rosters with comm-out recall
       procedures outlined will work well for this process.
       2.2.3. The 8 FW leadership will direct use of all means available. Depending on
       availability, examples could include: ―Giant Voice‖ (public address system) or
       loudspeaker-equipped vehicles, radio and television announcements (Commander’s
       Access Channel), sending 8th Security Forces Squadron (8 SFS), 8th Civil Engineer
8FWI36-2101 25 AUGUST 2009                                                                 3


     Squadron, Fire Department (8 CES/CEF) or 8th Medical Group (8 MDG) personnel to all
     residents to notify individuals.
     2.2.4. Each organization will develop a ―runner‖ system (messenger) for intra-base
     communications.
  2.3. At a minimum, all unit commanders will:
     2.3.1. Ensure their units develop and maintain two recall systems (telephone and comm-
     out), or one recall system that meets the requirements of both telephone and comm-out
     recalls. The Command Post (8 FW/CP) currently views rosters and when directed will
     retrieve and print record copies of rosters.
     2.3.2. Ensure individuals who depart TDY, are placed on quarters, are placed in
     confinement, etc., have their duty status properly updated.
     2.3.3. Provide the UCC’s with unit personnel strength figures IAW senior staff directive
     and this instruction.
  2.4. At a minimum, individuals will:
     2.4.1. Become thoroughly familiar with the unit’s standby procedures and recall systems.
     2.4.2. Inform supervisors when they leave the Kunsan area, as well as provide them with
     contact numbers at all times.
     2.4.3. Respond immediately IAW instructions passed for recalls.
  2.5. Upon implementation of a base-wide recall, the Emergency Operations Center will
  notify the UCCs with:
     2.5.1. The time the exercise/contingency started.
     2.5.2. The name of the exercise/contingency.
     2.5.3. The exact time strength figures need to be updated in TBMCS.
  2.6. Upon implementation of a base-wide recall, the Installation Personnel Readiness
  Section (IPR) will accomplish the following:
     2.6.1. Review all leave and TDY recall messages.
     2.6.2. Obtain and verify the ―other status‖ report from each UCC Recall Checklist (See
     Attachment 5).
     2.6.3. Request replacement personnel so commanders will have the required forces to
     accomplish their wartime mission.
     2.6.4. Replacement requests are processed on an as-needed basis. The IPR requests
     necessary replacements upon direction by the EOC. Requested replacement messages
     should match the duty Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) and Special Experience
     Identifier (SEI) of the deceased or aeromedically evacuated person. Replacement
     messages should not be accomplished to backfill personnel working out of the duty
     AFSC (e.g., Augmentee Duty).

       2.6.5. At a minimum, replacement request messages are sent to HQ PACAF/A1.
       Informational copies of the message are sent to 7AF/A1 and each affected unit
       commander.
    2.7. Upon implementation of a base-wide recall, each strength accountability monitor
    will accomplish the following:
       2.7.1. Maintain accountability of all personnel assigned to the unit using the 8 FW Form
       6, Personnel Accountability Worksheet and the UCC Strength Reporting Checklist (See
       Attachment 6).
       2.7.2. Establish contact with their EOC representative upon arrival at the UCC.

       2.7.3. Provide ―other‖ status report to the IPR located in Bldg 817 no later than
       STARTEX +3 hours (See Attachment 3). Report may be sent electronically if necessary
       and possible. An electronic template is available in TBMCS.
       2.7.4. Accomplish ―Other – Unauthorized Absence‖ report (See Attachment 4) when a
       commander deems a individual to be in an unauthorized absence status IAW AFI 36-
       2911, Desertion and Unauthorized Absence. Report may be sent electronically to IPR if
       necessary and possible. An electronic template is available in TBMCS.
       2.7.5. Report strength accountability numbers in TBMCS no later than 60+, 120+ and
       180+minutes until there is 100% accountability of 8 FW personnel. If 100%
       accountability is not reached after 180+ minutes, units will report their numbers using the
       8 FW Form 6 directly to their EOC representative. Once a unit obtains 100%
       accountability, contact the EOC immediately.
       2.7.6. In the event of comm-out, complete the 8 FW Form 6 and send a copy with a
       runner to the EOC.
       2.7.7. Squadrons will make every effort to locate personnel in ―not contacted‖ status
       (See paragraph 1.2.1) during the recall, such as contacting friends, co-workers,
       roommate/suite mate, town patrol or Office of Special Investigation (OSI). If the
       individual is not located and the commander deems it necessary, he/she can place the
       individual in an appropriate duty status commensurate with guidance outlined in AFI 36-
       2911.
    2.8. When directed, strength accountability monitors will use the following methods to
    recall personnel on leave or TDY:
8FWI36-2101 25 AUGUST 2009                                                                    5


      2.8.1. LEAVE: Units will use the telephone to recall personnel. When recalling
      personnel, state the following: ―This is an 8 FW/CC directed recall; you are to
      immediately return to your duty section by the quickest means possible.‖
          2.8.1.1. Units unable to contact members on leave will send a message (See
          Attachment 2) to the military installation closest to the individual’s leave address.
          The message will include the member’s leave address and telephone number and the
          unit fund cite to pay for a telegram. Messages prepared for exercises must include the
          following statement in the ―Special Instructions‖ block: ―DO NOT TRANSMIT.
          THIS IS AN EXERCISE MESSAGE.‖
      2.8.2. TDY: Units will send a message (See Attachment 2) to the commander of the unit
      where the individual is TDY. Messages prepared for exercises must include the

     A5.1.7. Step 7: Using the 8 FW Form 6, use the BRAVO block to update the LV numbers
     in TBMCS, use the CHARLIE block to update the TDY numbers, leave the SIM block at 0,
     use the DELTA block to update the DEAD numbers, use the ECHO block to update the
     HOSP numbers, use the FOXTROT block to update the MISS numbers.
     A5.1.8. Step 8: Click on Confirm (This is going to bring you back to the Personnel View).
     A5.1.9. Step 9: On the navigation bar under your squadron, click on Recall (This will bring
     up the Recall View).
     A5.1.10. Step 10: If the Recall View does have a recall initiated by the 8 FW (i.e., the
     originator bar must state 8 FW:US) click on the UPDATE box (It is possible that your page
     needs to refresh) if you still do not have a recall initiated by the 8 FW, STOP. DO NOT
     PROCEED TO STEP 11 UNTIL THE RECALL INFORMATION IS POPULATED BY
     THE 8 FW. (In the meantime continue to manually track the number of personnel signing in
     to the unit).
     A5.1.11. Step 11: Click on the edit button (yellow pencil) in the Recall Area of TBMCS,
     this will bring up the numbers you entered in the Personnel Area of TBMCS.
     A5.1.12. Step 12: You will see the following columns ASNG, AUTH, LEAVE, TDY, E/D,
     DEAD, HOSP, MIS, NCOM (Add the numbers in the LEAVE, TDY, E/D, DEAD, HOSP,
     MIS, NCOM columns plus the number of personnel that have signed in to your squadron and
     enter the total of these numbers in the 60+block) and click on confirm (This is going to bring
     you back to the Recall View).

   A5.1.13. Step 13: Repeat steps 4 – 12 as changes occur (DO NOT SKIP ANY STEPS,
   AND ACCOMPLISH ALL ACTIONS IN EACH STEP FOR THE 120+BLOCK AND THE
   180+BLOCK) (i.e., After the 60+minute mark passes, you would continue to repeat steps 4-
   12 and update your numbers in the 120+block, after the 120+minute mark passes you would
   continue to repeat steps 4-12 and update your numbers in the 180+block).

Table A5.1. UCCs.
Notes:

1. UCCs should be one of the first personnel recalled (UCCs must stand up quickly).

2. When standing up a UCC, immediately pull duty status information from BLSDM.
        a. Manually track personnel using the 8 FW Form 6 and sign in rosters, until the ―recall‖
section of TBMCS has been populated by the 8 FW.

3. Remember that there are two sections in TBMCS that you are required to update:
PERSONNEL and RECALL.

         a. ―Personnel‖ is always updated first.

         b. NEVER change authorized or assigned numbers.

                (1). Manpower updates authorized number; MPE/IPR updates assigned.

                (2). If you need to dispute assigned numbers, please call the IPR at 782-5550.

The goal is to reach 100% accountability (“recall” section of TBMCS) within three hours of
the start of the Recall. A system change request is pending to allow UCCs to update
numbers after the 3rd hour.

       c. ―Personnel‖ percentage is a reflection of how many personnel are ―present for duty.‖
This percentage is normally below 100% and will rarely be at 100%, due to TDYs and leave.

4. Before the next recall, ensure that your TBMCS log-in and password work correctly. If not,
please contact the TBMCS office at 782-5222. If problems occur, entering data once the recall
has begun, call the IPR at 782-5550 or the EOC at 782-6052.

                                         Attachment 6
           UNIT CONTROL CENTER STRENGTH REPORTING CHECKLIST

A6.1. Personnel strength accountability does not end with the recall process, personnel must be
continually tracked throughout the entire exercise. Personnel strength changes with the
simulated deployment of personnel, arrival of follow on forces, and casualties (injured and
deceased). The UCC is responsible for reporting timely, accurate personnel strength in TBMCS.
     A6.1.1. Monitor the below personnel strength columns and change as appropriate:
        A6.1.1.1. Leave – Initial entry of personnel on leave at the time of the recall.      If
        personnel depart for leave after the recall, update the data as appropriate.
        A6.1.1.2. TDY – Initial entry of personnel TDY at the time of the recall. If personnel
        depart for a training, medical, or CONUS TDY (not deployment), update the data as
        appropriate. Deployed forces are updated in the ―SIM‖ column.
        A6.1.1.3. SIM – Enter the number of simulated deployed forces in this block. UDRMs
        are responsible for reporting how many personnel deploy through the Deployment
        Processing Line to the UCC. Enter this data as appropriate. (Example: 8 FSS deploys a
        two-man PERSCO team to another peninsula location…these two personnel should be
        entered into the SIM area upon departing).
           A6.1.1.3.1. Ensure to meet with your UDRM to set up reporting procedures.
        A6.1.1.4. Other – Automatic update of number of personnel in the ―DEAD‖ + ―HOSP‖ +
        ―MISS‖ + ―SIM‖ personnel
        A6.1.1.5. Dead – Update personnel as reported. Report the rank/name/squadron/AFSC
        to your unit EOC representative and IPR. Remember to request replacement action
        information. (Reference paragraph 2.6.4.1. of this instruction)
        A6.1.1.6. Hosp – Update the number of personnel who are hospitalized. Once the
        member is returned to duty, you would delete them from the numbers. Report the
        rank/name/squadron/AFSC to the appropriate EOC representative and IPR. Remember
        to request replacement action information. (Reference paragraph 2.6.4.1 of this
        instruction)
        A6.1.1.7. Miss – Enter the number of personnel missing. (Example: You report to the
        EOC that a member did not show up for their shift or did not return from lunch. While
        searching for that member, you should update their status in the missing column. Delete
        them from the numbers once the member has been returned to duty). Report the
        rank/name/squadron/AFSC to your unit EOC representative and IPR.
        A6.1.1.8. Deployed – This column can be found directly under the base column. This
        column is used to report the number of follow-on forces your squadron receives.
        UDRMs report the number of personnel they receive each chalk to the UCC. Place the
        information into the ―asgn‖ column. (Chalk 1: 8 FSS receives 10 personnel – enter 10;
        Chalk 4: 8 FSS receives 17 personnel – enter 27; chalk 10: 8 FSS receives 15 – enter 42,
        etc.)
           A6.1.1.8.1. Ensure to meet with your UDRM to set up reporting procedures.
8FWI36-2101 25 AUGUST 2009                                                                13


   A6.1.2. As personnel status changes occur, update them immediately. The most
   common changes will occur as a result of an attack. Once the teams are released to assess
   the damages, they immediately report the data to the UCC (Building number on fire, 5 dead,
   3 injured). Enter this data as soon as possible in TBMCS. The other common change will
   occur with the acceptance of follow on forces.
A6.2. Remember, the EOC uses personnel reporting to view the wing’s strength to make
important wartime decisions. Accurate timely reporting is the key!
