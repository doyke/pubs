SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

This publication is revised to change paragraphs 1.3. and 2.2.1., time requirement of 62 days to 60 days.
A bar ( | ) indicates revisions from the previous edition.


1. Policy.
   1.1. The Air Force recommends the purchase of equipment over leasing or renting because it is gen-
   erally less costly.
   1.2. However, there are times when leasing or renting may have advantages, for example, when:
       1.2.1. Equipment is needed only for a short period of time.
       1.2.2. An evaluation period is needed to find out whether the equipment is properly suited for its
       intended use.
       1.2.3. Technology is changing so rapidly that the model will be obsolete before the equipment can
       be fully amortized.
       1.2.4. The equipment is extremely expensive.
       1.2.5. The equipment is unavailable for purchase.
2                                                                   HILLAFBI65-502 23 APRIL 1996


       1.2.6. The equipment is required but purchase funds are unavailable.
    1.3. Validate that a requirement exists for the proposed equipment. Before equipment is leased, an
    OO-ALC Form 16, Lease Versus Buy Analysis, must be completed. OO-ALC Form 16 will accom-
    pany all requests, except for those with a requirement of less than or equal to 60 days where no future
    need exists for this or similar equipment. OO-ALC Form 16 will be completed when initiating,
    reviewing or extending a lease or rental contract. OO-ALC Form 16 will accompany the request (AF
    Form 9, Request for Purchase; AF Form 601, Equipment Action Request; etc.).
    1.4. Complete OO-ALC Form 16 for any lease of one or more assets that has a total fair market value
    exceeding $1 million according to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular Number
    A-104 and not this instruction.

2. Responsibilities.
    2.1. Cost Analysis Team in the Appropriated Funds Management Branch (OO-ALC/OO-ALC/
    FMBA) will:
       2.1.1. Develop and revise, as necessary, the procedures and format for accomplishing Lease Ver-
       sus Buy Analysis.
       2.1.2. Upon request, provide assistance to base personnel in accomplishing Lease Versus Buy
       Analysis.
       2.1.3. Provide assistance, upon request, to Operational Contracting Division (OO-ALC/PKO) in
       reviewing OO-ALC Form 16.
       2.1.4. Verify OO-ALC Form 16 for lease requirements whose total monthly lease cost (monthly
       lease cost plus maintenance cost) exceeds $500.
    2.2. OO-ALC/PKO will:
       2.2.1. Return any arriving purchase request (PR) package for a lease greater than 60 days when
       such PR is not accompanied by OO-ALC Form 16.
       2.2.2. Review all OO-ALC Forms 16 to ensure that they are complete and accomplished in accor-
       dance with this instruction. Questions concerning the quality and application of the Lease Versus
       Buy Analysis should be addressed to OO-ALC/FMBA.
       2.2.3. Maintain OO-ALC Form 16 on file with the lease request.
    2.3. The appropriate office of primary responsibility (OPR) must confirm that a valid requirement
    exists for the equipment. Listed below are types of equipment and their respective approval offices.
       2.3.1. Vehicles: Transportation Division (75 ABW/LGT) or 75 Range Squadron Commander (75
       RANS/CC) for Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR).

      2.3.7. Safety: Ground Safety Division (OO-ALC/SEG).
   2.4. Organizations or units requesting the leasing of equipment covered by this instruction will pre-
   pare an OO-ALC Form 16, for each request to initiate, renew, or extend a lease. Organizations or units
   requesting the leasing of equipment must accomplish and document a safety compliance assessment
   (MIL STD 882B, Task 210) to verify compliance with appropriate military, federal, national and
   industry codes, and to evaluate the safety risk being assumed prior to operation of the equipment.
   2.5. Unit commanders, directors and chiefs of staff offices act as the approval requester. It is their
   responsibility to ensure the leasing of the equipment is in the best interest of the Air Force. This
   approval authority cannot be delegated below division chief or squadron commander level.

3. Procedures.
   3.1. Organizations or units having a requirement to initiate, renew, or extend a lease for equipment
   covered by this instruction must justify the leasing of the equipment with an OO-ALC Form 16.
   Attachment 1 provides detailed guidance on how to complete OO-ALC Form 16.
   3.2. The OO-ALC Form 16 must be approved by the appropriate authority (see paragraph 2.5.) before
   being released with the lease request for processing. If the total monthly lease cost monthly lease cost
   plus maintenance cost) exceeds $500, the OO-ALC Form 16, will be verified by OO-ALC/FMBA
   prior to release of lease request and Lease Versus Buy Analysis for normal lease processing.
   3.3. Review actions of 75 ABW/LGT, 75 SPS/SPA, 75 MSS/IMC, 75 CS, 75 SPS/SPA, OO-ALC/
   SEG, and OO-ALC/PKO on Lease Versus Buy Analysis that are accomplished during the normal pro-
   cessing of lease request.
   3.4. The completed OO-ALC Form 16 will be included with the lease request (AF Form 9, AF Form
   601, and so forth) when the lease request is forwarded through channels for processing.
