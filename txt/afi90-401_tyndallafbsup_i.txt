SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This is the second publication of AFI 90-401. The initial publication superseded AFR 11-7, 22
December 1983, eliminating the requirement to file reports for congressional committee
investigations, hearings, or visits. This revision establishes the Office of Legislative Liaison,
Congressional Action Division, SAF/LLX, as the OPR to provide support to wing commanders
during visits with members of Congress and their staffs. SAF/LLX will provide support to wing
commanders in coordination with the Office of Budget and Appropriations Liaison, SAF/FML,
as appropriate. Paragraphs 3.2 and 4.1 are modified, and paragraph 4.9 is added. Additionally,
paragraph 1.4 is consolidated into paragraph 1.2, and existing paragraphs 1.5 through 1.8 are
redesignated as paragraphs 1.4 through 1.7.
1. Releasing Information:
1. (TYNDALLAFB)Releasing Information: CONGRESSIONAL VISITATION: All 325
FW units immediately notify Protocol (325 FW/CCP) of requests by members of Congress or
congressional staff members to visit Tyndall AFB. After notifying the Wing Commander or
Vice Commander (325 FW/CC/CV), 325 FW/CCP notifies the AETC Command Action Group
(HQ AETC/CCX) of the request via AETC Form 88. The 325 FW/CC or CV will appoint a
Project Officer to serve as the POC for the visit. The POC will provide 325 FW/CCP with a
proposed itinerary and an outline of potential issues. 325 FW/CCP will provide HQ AETC/CCX
a copy of the itinerary and outline of potential issues, as required by AETCI 90-402 and also
notifies Command Post (325 FW/CP). The POC will notify 325 FW/CCP, who will in turn
notify 325 FW/CP and HQ AETC/CCX of any changes to itinerary.
     1.1. Congressional Inquiries. Air Force policy is to cooperate fully with the Congress, and
     to give full and timely responses to congressional inquiries.
AFI90-401_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011                                                    3


  1.1. (TYNDALLAFB) The visit POC will provide 325 FW/CCP with a synopsis of the
  outcome and any issues discussed. 325 FW/CCP will forward to AETC/CCX the synopsis
  and issues discussed of potential interest to the AETC/CC or CV, regardless of whether
  SAF/LL or SAF/FML escorted the visit.
  1.2. Classified Information. Air Force personnel must properly safeguard information
  classified in the interests of national defense (according to DoD 5200.1-R, Information
  Security Program Regulation, June 1986, with Change 1 and AFI 31-401, Information
  Security Program Management [formerly AFRs 205-1 and 205-43]). We may disclose
  classified information to the Congress only with the consent of the Secretary of the Air Force
  IAW the aforementioned regulations. The Secretary has designated the Office of Security
  Review (SAF/PAS) as the approval authority for release of classified information to the
  Congress. Refer congressional requests for classified information to SAF/PAS through
  SAF/LL or SAF/FML. Also, Air Force officials must not disclose classified information to
  the Congress for release to a congressional constituent. The only exception is declassified
  and releasable information the constituent could receive under AFI 37-131 (converting to AF
  Supplement to DoD 5400.7-R).
  1.3. "For Official Use Only" Information. According to AFI 37-131, Air Force Freedom
  of Information Act Program (converting to AF Supplement to DoD 5400.7-R), Air Force
  officials may generally not disclose For Official Use Only (FOUO) information to the public
  that falls within exemptions 2 through 9 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
  However, the Air Force may release such information to chairpersons or ranking minority
  members of congressional committees or subcommittees if the information relates to matters
  within their jurisdiction. An Air Force official who decides the information should not be
  released to the congressional committee must staff the congressional request for information
  with a recommendation to the Secretary of the Air Force through SAF/LL.
  1.4. Privacy Act Information. Air Force officials must protect personal information about
  military and civilian employees according to the guidelines of the Privacy Act. Without an
  individual’s written consent to release information, Air Force officials may provide only
  general information according to the provisions of AFI 37-132, Air Force Privacy Act
  Program (converting to AFI 33-332) which sets forth the Privacy Act procedures. The Air
  Force may, however, disclose an individual’s records without the individual’s consent when
  requested by a chairperson or ranking minority member of a congressional committee or
  subcommittee if the information relates to matters within their jurisdiction. When making
  such a disclosure, the Air Force should tell the committee or subcommittee members about
  any sensitive information and the need to safeguard it.
  1.5. Information from Air Force People. Air Force personnel have the legal right to
  petition, furnish information to, or communicate with the Congress (Title 5, United States
  Code, Section 7102 and Title 10, United States Code, Section 1034).
  1.6. Locally Sensitive Information. Information on changes in the status of Air Force
  units, installations, and industrial facilities may have an impact on states and congressional
  districts. Therefore, Air Force officials must not release such information without approval
  from the Secretary of the Air Force. Refer congressional requests for such information to the
  Office of the Secretary of the Air Force through SAF/LL or SAF/FML.

     1.7. Congressional Security Clearances. Senators and Representatives have Top Secret
     clearances. The Air Force allows members on special committees to see all documents
     relevant to the committee. To verify the security clearance of congressional staff members,
     contact the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Legislative Affairs Security Office
     (OSD/LA).
2. Congressional Visits:
2. (TYNDALLAFB)Congressional Visits: CONGRESSIONAL OR HIGH LEVEL
INQUIRIES: Immediately notify the Wing Inspector General’s office (325 FW/IG) of all
incoming congressional and high- level inquiries. NOTE: This includes requests for information
from other organizations (HQ AETC Staff, USAF/DPFM, AFPC/DSXI, etc.) responding to a
congressional or high- level inquiry involving a 325 FW issue.
     2.1. Members of Congress and their staffs may need to visit Air Force activities. The Air
     Force fully supports and encourages these visits.
     2.1. (TYNDALLAFB) Upon receipt, 325 FW/IG will task the appropriate agency via
     telephone and email. Tasking email will contain a suspense back to the 325 FW/IG. NOTE:
     Only the 325 FW/IG coordinates with the tasking organization for a change in suspense date.
     2.2. With Secretary of the Air Force approval, the Air Force may provide transportation for
     congressional visits.
     2.2. (TYNDALLAFB) 325 FW/IG will email courtesy copies of the inquiry to the required
     AETC agencies. If the inquiry is direct from a Congressman’s office (by-passes AF
     channels), the inquiry will be forwarded to SAF/LLI. SAF/LLI will determine whether the
     inquiry will be placed in Air Force channels or the whether the wing will answer directly.
     2.3. Restrictions on congressional visits apply during election years and to political
     activities. Contact SAF/LL or the Office of Public Affairs (SAF/PA) about these restrictions.
     2.3. (TYNDALLAFB) The 325 FW/IG will ensure congressional complaints are properly
     documented in the Automated Complaints Tracking System (ACTS III).
     2.4. (Added-TYNDALLAFB) Congressional inquiries are sensitive issues; the privacy and
     rights of affected individuals must be protected at all times. Any written or printed materials
     must be safeguarded and discussions limited to those with a need-to-know. The 325 FW/IG
     will provide a distinctive folder coversheet for transporting congressional packages that can
     not be transmitted electronically. All written correspondence relating to a congressional
     package should be labeled “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.” For electronically transmitted
     packages, ensure that all addresses are authorized to receive the package and that the subject
     line reads – “FOUO: SENSITIVE CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRY: Senator [Congressman]
     Smith, 15 Feb 07.” NOTE: Do not identify the name of the affected individual(s) on the e-
     mail subject line. Ensure you use the appropriate FOUO statement in accordance with the
     information in the content of the message.
     2.5. (Added-TYNDALLAFB) Assigned OPRs will prepare an in-depth response accurately
     answering all questions or concerns in official memo format. The 325 FW/CC or CV will
     approve/sign all replies to congressional or high- level inquiries. For questions on the
     response format, contact the 325 FW/IG.
AFI90-401_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011                                                     5


   2.6. (Added-TYNDALLAFB) Route all response packages electronically. Routing will
   use an AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet, in accordance with sample in Attachment 1.
   After all the coordination is complete, the 325 FW/IG will hand carry the package to the 325
   FW/CCE. The 325 FW/CCE will in-turn coordinate with 325 FW/CV and CC for approval
   and signature.
   2.7. (Added-TYNDALLAFB) Following 325 FW/CC or CV approval, the 325 FW/CCE
   will notify 325 FW/IG. The 325 FW/IG will then e- mail the approved response to the
   tasking agency with a courtesy copy to the wing OPR. The 325 FW/IG will ensure the
   response is documented and the case file is closed in ACTS III.
   2.8. (Added-TYNDALLAFB) OPRs must meet the assigned suspense date. If a final reply
   will not be forwarded by the established suspense date, immediately notify the 325 FW/IG.

     documents related to congressional investigations when there are legal issues involved
     such as the Privacy Act and claims of privilege.
     4.5.6. If a committee notes any deficiencies in Air Force operations or procedures during
     its field investigation and if the Air Force can take immediate corrective action, do so and
     advise the committee and either SAF/LL or SAF/FML.
  4.6. Congressional Itinerary Changes:
     4.6.1. A commander or escort officer who learns of a change in congressional itinerary
     must coordinate with facilities scheduled for later visits to avoid unannounced arrivals.
     4.6.2. The escort officer coordinates each schedule change with SAF/LL or SAF/FML
     and with all affected activities. All Air Force personnel must give the officer full
     cooperation.
     4.6.3. For unescorted trips, the host commander notifies SAF/LL or SAF/FML of
     itinerary changes and any new or changed requests. Coordinate directly with facilities
     scheduled later in the itinerary regarding briefings, transportation, quarters, or other
     support.
  4.7. Photography During Congressional Visits:
     4.7.1. When the Air Force takes photographs during a congressional visit, the host field
     organization must send copies of black and white, 5 by 7- inch glossy prints, with
     captions, to SAF/LL or SAF/FML within 72 hours after they are developed. For color
     photographs, send a first- generation transparency.
     4.7.2. Original negatives of congressional visits are nonrecord photography. Destroy
     them with the permission of the local commander. The Air Force may arrange for
     processing prints of congressional visits through Air Force-sponsored, government-
     owned, or commercially operated plants.
  4.8. Congressional Committee Investigation or Visit:
     4.8.1. If SAF/LL or SAF/FML personnel do not escort members of the Congress or their
     staffs, field commanders should inform SAF/LL or SAF/FML about the outcome of the
     visit or investigation. Field commanders should also provide information to other
     interested echelons at their discretion.
     4.8.2. Convey the following information to SAF/LL or SAF/FML: the site and length of
     the visit, names of visiting Members of Congress and staff representatives, deficiencies
     disclosed by the visit, requests for information, and corrective action.

  4.9. Wing Commander Visits With Congressional Delegations:
     4.9.1. USAF Wing Commanders are required to visit Capitol Hill annually to meet with
     their congressional and home state delegations. Commanders should contact SAF/LLX
     (DSN 225-1000) to arrange these meetings and provide escort.
