1. General. The items listed do not constitute the order or limit the scope of the
inspection/assessment. As a minimum, units should use these directives in conjunction with the
annual Unit Self-Assessment. The objective is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of
required capabilities. Units can supplement this publication to add internal compliance items.
This directive may be used in whole or in part by HHQ during visits or exercises. Users may add
any items(s), which, in the exercise of good judgment, requires examination.
   1.1. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCO). Items defined by the AF ISR Agency staff as
   key result areas for successful mission accomplishment include, but are not limited to, items
 2                                                       AFISRACL90-212 16 FEBRUARY 2012


      where non-compliance could result in serious injury, loss of life, excessive cost, or litigation.
      Critical Compliance Objectives are shown in BOLD AND ALL CAPS FORMAT (Table
      1.1).
      1.2. Core Compliance Items (CCI). Areas that require special vigilance and are important
      to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed "Critical." Non-compliance would
      result in some negative impact on mission performance or could result in injury, unnecessary
      cost, or possible litigation. Core Compliance Items are shown in ALL CAPS FORMAT
      (Table 1.1).
      1.3. General Compliance Items (GCI). Areas deemed fundamental to successful overall
      performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in minimal impact on mission
      accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury, increased cost, or possible litigation.
      General Compliance Items are shown in sentence case format (Table 1.1).
