This instruction implements and expands on the guidance in AFPD 21-1, Air and Space
Maintenance and AFI 21-101, AFRC Sup1, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management,
establishing procedures and assigning responsibilities for 934 Maintenance and Operations
personnel that discover a hot brake condition. Ensure that all records created as a result of
process prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force manual
(AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force
Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcssaf61a/afrims/afrims/. Refer recommended changes and

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The changes to this instruction include updated procedures.        This instruction has been
substantially revised and must be reviewed in its entirety.
1. Responsibilities: Supervisors at all levels within the Maintenance Group are responsible for
ensuring compliance with this instruction.
2. Procedures:
   2.1. Preparation. Aircrew will follow procedures in the Technical Order (TO) 1C-130(K)H-1
   for ground evacuation.
 2                                                          934AWI21-117 6 NOVEMBER 2013


        2.1.1. If the flight crew suspects or is otherwise informed of hot brakes during taxi
        operations, they should follow applicable emergency guidance or procedures.
        2.1.2. If the ground crew discovers an aircraft has hot brakes upon arrival, place chocks
        around nose landing gear tires, ensure brakes are released to facilitate cooling, and
        evacuate the area immediately. If there is an aircraft in an adjacent spot, (hot brake side)
        the adjacent aircraft should be towed clear of the hazard.
        2.1.3. Notify 934TH Maintenance Operations Control (MOC) to proceed with applicable
        Hot Brakes Checklist, and follow remaining procedures in this instruction as applicable.
     2.2. On arrival, the Metropolitan Airport Commission (MAC) fire department will verify the
     hot brake condition. If MAC fire is unable to verify a hot brake condition, the brakes will be
     considered hot. Personnel will evacuate the area within a 300 foot radius of the aircraft as a
     minimum. MAC Fire or a designated on-scene commander (OSC), and/or maintenance
     supervision will notify maintenance personnel when to approach aircraft.
        Warning: The area on either side (inboard and outboard) of an overheated wheel must be
clear of personnel and equipment for at least 300 feet. Due to the possibility of a wheel
explosion, all personnel must remain clear of the aircraft for at least 30 minutes or until after the
brakes have sufficiently cooled. Under no circumstances approach the aircraft without
permission from MAC fire and concurrence of designated maintenance supervisor or other
designated OSC.
        2.2.1. Once the aircraft engines are shut down, maintenance must wait 30 minutes after
        the brakes have sufficiently cooled before any maintenance action is performed.
        Maintenance will consist of a qualified tow crew with tow bar and vehicle.
        2.2.2. Repair and Reclamation Section personnel to determine serviceability of wheels
        and brakes IAW TO 4B-l-l, Use of Landing Gear Wheel Brakes and Wheels during
        Ground Operations and TO 4W-1-4-1013, Overhaul with Part Breakdown for Main
        Landing Gear Wheel.
        2.2.3. Approach from forward or aft of the landing gear after brakes have sufficiently
        cooled; to inspect brakes, wheels, and tires; ensuring that all components are safe to tow.
        Crew chiefs or other qualified maintenance personnel may then tow the aircraft as
        required.
3. Documentation:
     3.1. The following documentation will be annotated in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance
     Discrepancy and Work Document:
        3.1.1. Document the initial discrepancy of hot brake(s), detailing the specific gear and
        brake affected, under a Red X symbol.
        3.1.2. Ensure PS&D is notified to schedule Hot Brake(s) and Tire inspection, WUC:
        1342Q & 13720 IAW 1C-130A-6 & 4T-1-3.
