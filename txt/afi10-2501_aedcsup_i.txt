This instruction implements Air Force Policy Document (AFPD) 10-2, Readiness; AFPD 10-25,
Emergency Management; AFPD 10-26, Counter-Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and
Nuclear Operations; AFPD 10-8, Homeland Security; Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 2-
1.8, Counter Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Operations; and portions of AFDD 2-4.1, Force
Protection. It also aligns the Air Force with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 (HSPD-
5), the National Incident Management System (NIMS), and the National Response Framework
(NRF), formerly known as the National Response Plan (NRP). This instruction also implements
the Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) based on the NIMS methodology and
aligns Air Force EM planning and response with the NRF as directed by HSPD-5. This
instruction defines the Air Force EM program as a cross-functional program that integrates
procedures and standards for planning; logistical requirements; emergency response actions;
emergency response guidelines; exercises and evaluations; personnel training; detection,
identification, and warning; notification; and enemy attack actions.              It establishes

responsibilities, procedures, and standards for Air Force mitigation and emergency response to
physical threats resulting from major accidents; natural disasters; conventional attacks (including
those using High-Yield Explosives); and terrorist use of CBRN materials. This instruction
includes domestic and foreign guidance. (NOTE: HQ Pacific Air Forces [PACAF] will
determine whether domestic or foreign guidance applies to Alaska and Hawaii.) Its prescribed
planning process helps commanders achieve unity of effort, allocate and use resources
effectively, and identify shortfalls in their response capabilities. See Attachment 1 for
definitions of acronyms, abbreviations, and terms used in this instruction. Consult cited policy
directives, instructions, manuals, and their supplements for specific policies, procedures, and
requirements. This publication applies to Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air
National Guard (ANG) units. Send recommended changes and major command (MAJCOM)

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

These changes have not been integrated into the basic publication. The reader must use this
interim change (IC) in conjunction with the publication and these changes take precedence. This
IC updates the Emergency Management Working Group to include the Hazardous Materials
(HAZMAT) Emergency Planning Team as a sub-working group, its suggested membership and
scope of responsibility. This change outlines the three ways the Air National Guard and Air
Force Reserve Command units can obtain the CBRNE Defense Awareness Course. Security
Forces can use their Standardization Evaluation Qualifications in lieu of the Unit Control Center
training in Chapter 6. It also changes exercise requirements for the Emergency Management
Program. The intent of the change is to allow MAJCOMs and installations to exercise risk
management in their approach to EM exercises.

                                           Chapter 1

             AIR FORCE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) PROGRAM

1.1. General Information. This instruction implements Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD)
2-1.8, Counter Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Operations; Air Force Policy Document
(AFPD) 10-2, Readiness; AFPD 10-25, Full-Spectrum Threat Response (to be renamed
Emergency Management); AFPD 10-26, Counter-Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical
Operational Preparedness (to be renamed Counter-Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and
Nuclear Operations); AFPD 10-8, Homeland Security; and portions of AFDD 2-4.1, Force
Protection. It also aligns the Air Force with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 5 (HSPD-
5), the National Incident Management System (NIMS), and the National Response Plan (NRP).
This instruction also implements the Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) based on
the NIMS methodology and aligns Air Force EM planning and response with the NRP as
directed by HSPD-5. The AFIMS provides scalable and flexible response to organize field-level
operations for a broad spectrum of emergencies. The EM program addresses the impacts of
major accidents, natural disasters, conventional attacks, and terrorist attacks. Commanders can
achieve unity of effort, use resources effectively, and identify shortfalls using the AFIMS
planning process and this instruction. AFIMS is defined in Attachment 1.
1.2. Purpose. This instruction provides the staff and key agencies of higher headquarters,
installations, and unit commanders with the policies, guidance, structure, and roles and
responsibilities to prepare for, prevent, respond to, recover from, and mitigate threats to their
mission. This instruction also includes guidance to plan, conduct, and evaluate Air Force EM
exercises.
 NOTE: For differentiation purposes, the terms "CBRN" and "CBRNE" are defined below and
 in Attachment 1.
 CBRN. Operations that include chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear materials, either
 individually or in combination. Collectively known as weapons of mass destruction
 (WMD), CBRN replaces "Nuclear, biological, or chemical (NBC)" when used in reference
 to operations or incidents limited to WMD issues. Toxic Industrial Chemicals or Toxic
 Industrial Materials (TIC/TIM) and Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) are considered part of
 the "C" in "CBRN".
 CBRNE. Operations or incidents involving chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and
 high-yield explosives, or materials, either individually or in combination. "CBRNE" is used
 whenever reference is not being made to "NBC-only" operations or incidents.
1.3. Mission. The primary missions of the Air Force EM program are to save lives; minimize
the loss or degradation of resources; and continue, sustain, and restore operational capability in
an all-hazards physical threat environment at Air Force installations worldwide. The ancillary
missions of the Air Force EM program are to support homeland defense and civil support
operations and to provide support to civil and host nation authorities IAW DOD directives and
through the appropriate Combatant Command (COCOM). The Air Force EM program addresses
the physical threats listed in paragraph 1.1, occurring either individually or in combination.
AFIMS phases of incident management include prevention, preparation, response, recovery, and
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                              9


mitigation. The Air Force EM program examines potential emergencies and disasters based on
the risks posed by likely hazards; develops and implements programs aimed toward reducing the
impact of these events on the installation; prepares for risks that cannot be eliminated; and
prescribes actions required to deal with consequences of actual events and to recover from those
events.
1.4. Program Policy. The Air Force will establish a single integrated EM program to mitigate
the effects of major accidents; natural disasters; conventional attacks (including those using high-
yield explosives); and terrorist use of CBRN materials on Air Force personnel, resources, and
operations. The Air Force EM program will develop and implement measures for, and manage
activities related to, emergency preparedness, incident management, passive defense (including
response and recovery operations) and consequence management. The Air Force Civil Engineer
(AF/A7C) is the office of primary responsibility (OPR) for the Air Force EM program. Chapter
3 lists responsibilities of organizations that manage other program elements. The Air Force EM
program is established IAW this instruction.
   1.4.1. When compliance with this publication is impractical due to unique local or
   MAJCOM situations, request a waiver from AF/A7CX. An approved waiver remains in
   effect until the approving official cancels it in writing or this instruction is revised. When the
   OPR revises this publication, the waiver requester must renew the waiver. Until a waiver is
   approved by AF/A7CX, the MAJCOM or installation must make every effort to comply with
   this publication. The instruction OPR must maintain a copy of all waiver requests with the
   instruction record set.
   1.4.1. (AEDC) All requests for waivers will be submitted to the Operating Contractor’s
   Emergency Management (EM) Office. EM will coordinate with the 704th Civil Engineer
   Squadron Commander (704 CES/CC) in his/her capacity as Chairperson for the Emergency
   Management Working Group (EMWG). 704 CES/CC will present all waiver requests to the
   Readiness Board (RB) and Readiness Council (RC) for final approval and submit to
   AF/A7CX through AFMC/A7OX.
   1.4.2. MAJCOM and other agency supplements to this publication should be forwarded to
   HQ AFCESA/CEXR. Supplements cannot be less restrictive than the basic publication;
   however, if needed, they can be more restrictive. Waivers to supplemental guidance will be
   handled by the agency that developed the supplement.
1.5. Major Program Elements. Major program elements of the Air Force EM program include
warning and reporting, command and control (C2), planning, equipping, organizing, training,
exercising, evaluating, response operations and incident management.
1.6. Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Support.
1.6. (AEDC)In lieu of a Civil Engineer (CE) Readiness Flight , the Operating Contractor’s
EM Office is responsible for all peacetime planning and emergency response operations at
Arnold Air Force Base (AAFB). The Operating Contractor’s EM Office is responsible for
developing and maintaining the base’s EM Program. 704 CES/CC is the EM Program Manager
and assigns a performance evaluator to oversee the Emergency Management Program.
   1.6.1. Each Air Force unit must participate in the Air Force’s EM program and meet the Air
   Force’s EM program requirements in this and other governing instructions. The host Air
   Force installation will provide support to all assigned, attached, and tenant units, including
10                                         AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011


  Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) units, located on and
  off the installation. AFRC and ANG tenant units will be incorporated into the host
  installation’s Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2. The Readiness
  and Emergency Management Flight on the host installation is the Installation Commander’s
  Air Force EM program OPR and is the Installation Office of Emergency Management. As
  such, the intention of this AFI is that the Readiness and Emergency Management Flight
  under the Base Civil Engineer is the only Emergency Management Flight on an installation.
  The EM program must address the objectives and program elements related to all-hazard
  threats. Contract and civilian Readiness and Emergency Management Flights are waived
  from implementing the tasks in Table A3.3 until 31 July 2008. Contracted Readiness and
  Emergency Management Flights will need to amend their contracts to incorporate all the
  tasks in Table A3.3 by 30 August 2008. Readiness and Emergency Management Flights with
  civilian bargaining unit employees that are required to change workplace requirements and
  assume emergency response roles require bargaining. Bargained requirements will then be
  formalized by designating manpower positions with ―emergency responder‖ codes and
  updated job descriptions.
  1.6.2. MAJCOMs will determine the host installation for each Geographically Separated
  Unit (GSU) and provide guidance to train and equip its units in compliance with the EM
  program. Guidance may include supplementing this instruction and will include conducting
  Staff Assistance Visits (SAV). Air Force units located on other services’ installations will
  integrate into the host service’s EM program or equivalent.
  1.6.2. (AEDC) The EM Office will develop and implement an annual Unit Staff Assistance
  Visit (SAV) Program.
  1.6.3. Military resources may be used to help local authorities when necessary to save lives,
  prevent human suffering, or mitigate great property damage. See AFI 10-802, Military
  Support to Civil Authorities.
  1.6.4. Commanders at foreign locations will follow Department of State (DOS), theater, and
  MAJCOM guidance when assisting local authorities. Commanders at United States territories
  and US possessions will follow Department of the Interior (DOI), theater, and MAJCOM
  guidance when assisting local authorities. MAJCOMs will coordinate with the DOI to
  determine appropriate response protocols at US territory and US possession locations. These
  response protocols will be published in supplements to this instruction. (NOTE: HQ Pacific
  Air Forces [PACAF] will determine which guidance applies to Alaska and Hawaii.)
  1.6.5. The Air Force, under DOD direction, supports the EM programs of Federal agencies,
  as specified in the NRP and interagency agreements.
  1.6.6. Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Compliance with the NIMS. The
  Air Force revised the Full Spectrum Threat Response (FSTR) organizational construct and
  nomenclature as the Air Force EM program to be consistent with the NIMS and the NRP
  without compromising Air Force operational missions or disrupting military command
  authority. The Air Force uses the same structure for peace or war, at domestic and foreign
  locations. (See note in paragraph 1.6.4) To implement this change, standard NIMS
  terminology has replaced Air Force-specific terms. See Table 1.1, List of Cross-Referenced
  Terms.

1.7. Relationship to the National Response Plan (NRP) and National Incident Management
System (NIMS). On February 28, 2003, the President issued HSPD-5, which directs the
Secretary of Homeland Security to develop and administer the NIMS. This system provides a
consistent, nationwide approach for Federal, State, and local governments to work effectively
and efficiently together to prepare for, prevent, respond to, recover from, and mitigate domestic
incidents, regardless of cause, size, or complexity.
   1.7.1. The NIMS uses a systems approach to integrate the best existing processes and
   methods into a unified national framework for incident management. This framework forms
   the basis for interoperability and compatibility that will subsequently enable a diverse set of
   public and private organizations to conduct well-integrated and effective incident
   management operations. The NIMS provides interoperability and compatibility among
   various preparedness agencies through a core set of concepts, principles, terminology, and
   technologies. This core set includes:
       1.7.1.1. The Incident Command System (ICS).
       1.7.1.2. Multiagency Coordination System (MCS).
       1.7.1.3. Unified commands, as defined by the NRP and the NIMS rather than as defined
       by DOD.
       1.7.1.4. Training, qualifications, and certification.
       1.7.1.5. Resource identification and management, including systems for classifying types
       of resources.
       1.7.1.6. Incident information collecting, tracking, and reporting.
       1.7.1.7. Incident resources collecting, tracking, and reporting.
   1.7.2. The Air Force uses the NRP structure to implement the AFIMS. The NRP was
   developed to establish a comprehensive, national, all-hazards approach to incident
   management across a spectrum of activities. The NRP outlines how the Federal government
   implements the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as
   amended, (usually referred to as the Stafford Act) to assist State, local, and tribal
   governments when a major disaster or emergency overwhelms their ability to save lives;
   protect public health, safety, and property and restore their communities. The NRP and its
   resultant organizational structure are used by the Air Force to integrate its incident response
   with civilian responses. In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
   developed the NIMS Implementation Template for use by Federal departments and agencies
   to help them incorporate the NIMS into their emergency response plans, procedures, and
   policies. The template is available on the FEMA web site.
   1.7.3. The NRP requires an ICS designed to enable effective and efficient domestic incident
   management by integrating a combination of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures,
   and communications operating within a common organizational structure. ICS is used at all
   levels of government—Federal, State, local, and tribal—as well as by many private-sector
   organizations.
       1.7.3.1. The ICS is one of two methods used to provide a common operating picture
       (COP). The ICS provides the communications, intelligence sharing and information
       sharing for incident management. The COP provides the framework necessary to:
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                     13


        1.7.3.1.1. Formulate and disseminate indications and warnings.
        1.7.3.1.2. Formulate, execute, and communicate operational decisions at an incident
        site, as well as between incident management entities across jurisdictions and
        functional agencies.
        1.7.3.1.3. Prepare for potential requirements and request support for incident
        management activities.
        1.7.3.1.4. Develop and maintain overall awareness and understanding of an incident
        within and across jurisdictions.
     1.7.3.2. Information management is the second of the two methods used to provide a
     COP. In addition, the Air Force GeoBase Program provides situational awareness,
     supports C2, provides the capability to develop plumes and cordons, places information
     on a map that can be displayed and provides a tool kit that supports emergency response.

                                          Chapter 2

      AIR FORCE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) PROGRAM STRUCTURE

2.1. Purpose. This chapter discusses the organization of the Air Force EM program at all levels
of command. The Air Force EM program structure establishes a clear progression of
coordination and communication from installation level to MAJCOM level to Air Force level.
See Figure 2.1, Air Force Emergency Management Program. This structure has the following
two elements at each command level:
   2.1.1. A strategic planning and management staff to maintain an EM program.
   2.1.2. A tactical response structure to manage or conduct contingency response operations.

Figure 2.1. Air Force Emergency Management Program.
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                      15


2.2. Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Structure. The Air Force EM
program structure includes a strategic planning and management staff and a tactical response
element.
   2.2.1. At Air Force (AF) level, the EM planning and management structure is supported by
   and supports the Air Force Civil Engineer (AF/A7C), the AF Counter-CBRN (C-CBRN)
   Council; the AF C-CBRN Policy Working Group (PWG); the AF C-CBRN Education,
   Training, Exercise (ETE) Working Group; the AF Force Protection Steering Group (FPSG);
   and the AF Force Protection Working Group (FPWG). See Figure 2.2, Air Force Emergency
   Management Program Structural Relationships – Air Force Level. The HQ Air Force Civil
   Engineer Support Agency (HQ AFCESA/CEX) provides primary support to AF/A7C for the
   Air Force EM program.

Figure 2.2. Air Force Emergency Management Program Structural Relationships – Air
Force Level




       2.2.1.1. The AF C-CBRN Council is chartered by the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air
       Force and chaired by the Director of Strategic Security (AF/A3S). The Council meets
       quarterly or as directed by the Chair to address Air Force-wide issues to counter CBRN
       threats. The C-CBRN Council:
          2.2.1.1.1. Oversees Air Force C-CBRN policy and guidance measures to organize,
          train, and equip forces IAW the National Security Strategy, National Strategy to
          Combat WMD, Quadrennial Defense Review, Strategic Planning Guidance, and other
          policy documents.
          2.2.1.1.2. Addresses Air Force actions to counter CBRN threats through proliferation
          prevention, counterforce, active defense, passive defense, and consequence
          management.
          2.2.1.1.3. Oversees Air Force CBRN issues to maximize warfighting capabilities and
          support lead Federal agencies.
          2.2.1.1.4. Responds to C-CBRN issues presented by its members.
          2.2.1.1.5. Coordinates with the Force Protection Steering Group to prevent
          duplication of effort.
16                                         AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011


     2.2.1.2. The AF C-CBRN PWG is chartered and directed by the AF C-CBRN Council to
     carry out Council taskings, monitor cross-functional Air Force C-CBRN policy
     initiatives, and report its activities at Council meetings. The PWG may establish study
     teams and assign research and analysis actions. The AF Deputy Director for
     Counterproliferation (AF/A3SC) chairs the C-CBRN PWG. The C-CBRN PWG
     coordinates with the Force Protection Working Group (FPWG) to prevent duplication of
     effort.
     2.2.1.3. The AF C-CBRN ETE WG is chartered and directed by the AF C-CBRN
     Council to provide individuals with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to enable
     operations in a CBRN environment. The AF C-CBRN ETE WG may establish study
     teams relevant to education, training, and exercise responsibilities. The AF/A3SC chairs
     the AF C-CBRN ETE WG with HQ AETC as co-chair.
  2.2.2. In support of Air Force operations and as the Air Force lead for Agile Combat Support
  (ACS), the Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics, Installations, and Mission Support (AF/A4/7)
  provides policy direction and oversight of the Air Force disaster response force (DRF)
  capabilities for response, recovery, and sustainment of operations. When directed, the Air
  Staff will assist installations through the Air Force Operations Center (AFOC) to provide
  guidance and supplemental resources for any incident involving Air Force resources. The
  AFOC is the Air Force 24-hour point of contact for EM and Defense Support of Civil
  Authorities (DSCA) operations. See AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, for AFOC and
  MAJCOM Operations Centers contact information.
2.3. Major Command (MAJCOM) Emergency Management (EM) Program Structure.
  2.3.1. The Air Force EM planning and management structure at MAJCOM headquarters is
  supported by and supports the MAJCOM CE, the Force Protection Executive Council
  (FPEC), FPWG, the Emergency Management Working Group (EMWG), the C-CBRNE
  Working Group (WG), and headquarters staff such as CE Readiness, Fire Emergency
  Services (FES), Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), Medical (SG), and Security Forces
  (SF). See Figure 2.3, Air Force Emergency Management Program Structural Relationships –
  MAJCOM Level. MAJCOMs may deviate from the specified structure based upon their
  missions and command structure.
     2.3.1.1. The MAJCOM C-CBRNE WG (also called CPWG) is a collaborative, cross-
     functional group that provides advice and consultation to the MAJCOM leadership on Air
     Force C-CBRNE operations-related issues. The MAJCOM C-CBRNE WG is chaired by
     the MAJCOM/A3 or A5 at the discretion of the MAJCOM/CV (or can be chaired by the
     CV directly). The C-CBRNE WG coordinates with the FPEC to prevent duplication of
     effort.
     2.3.1.2. The MAJCOM FPEC (not shown in Figure 2.3) is an executive-level group with
     MAJCOM-level responsibilities similar to those of the AF FPSG. See AFI 10-245.
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                       17


Figure 2.3. Air Force Emergency Management Program Structural Relationships – Major
Command Level




NOTE: This diagram shows the relationship between specific working groups, rather than all
working groups at a MAJCOM.
      2.3.1.3. The MAJCOM EMWG addresses MAJCOM-wide cross-functional issues that
      affect the readiness and FP status and capabilities of the MAJCOM and addresses
      peacetime major accidents and natural disasters. The MAJCOM/A7C chairs the
      MAJCOM EMWG. The EMWG meets at least semiannually. The EMWG reviews
      AFIMS and EM training issues; monitors installation’s EM operational plans and
      exercises; reviews readiness issues IAW AFPDs 10-2 and 10-4; reviews SAV, exercise
      and IG trends; monitors AFIMS and CBRNE defense equipment shortfalls; coordinates
      new AFIMS tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) and initiatives; and reviews
      CBRNE defense training. MAJCOM EMWG representatives should be the subject matter
      action officers. Issues that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM level will be raised to the
      AF/A7C. Typical minimum MAJCOM EMWG membership includes:

          Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) A7
          Readiness                               Logistics
          Communications                          Operations
          Contracting                             Personnel
          Explosive Ordnance Disposal             Plans and Programs Fire
          Emergency Services                      Public Affairs History    Safety
          Inspector General                       Security Forces

          Judge Advocate                          Surgeon General


      2.3.1.4. The MAJCOM FPWG is required IAW AFI 10-245 to support the FPEC on FP
      enterprise management. The FPWG works FP issues assigned by the FPEC or proposed
      and agreed upon by the members. Members develop courses of action and recommend
      changes in policy and guidance for programs and activities effecting FP. The MAJCOM
      FPWG coordinates efforts with the MAJCOM EMWG to prevent duplication of effort.
 18                                       AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011


      The MAJCOM/A7S chairs the MAJCOM FPWG. The MAJCOM FPWG is an action
      officer group that meets to work FP issues.
      2.3.1.5. The MAJCOM Threat Working Group (TWG) provides situation-driven threat
      assessments. The fluid nature of the threat requires that the MAJCOM TWG have direct
      access to the MAJCOM commander. The MAJCOM TWG also advises the MAJCOM
      FPWG and the MAJCOM EMWG as needed.
   2.3.2. At MAJCOM level, the response elements includes the MAJCOM Command Center,
   Installation Control Center (ICC), EOC, and specialized teams such as the MAJCOM
   Response Task Forces (RTF). MAJCOMs activate their Commander’s Senior Staff when
   requested by Air Staff or the MAJCOM commander. The MAJCOM Commander’s Senior
   Staff assists the Air Staff or installations in response efforts.
2.4. Installation Emergency Management (EM) Program Structure.
   2.4.1. The installation planning and management structure is supported by or supports the
   installation Civil Engineer, the FPEC, EMWG, FPWG, TWG, the CE Readiness Flight, EM
   aspects of the installation exercise evaluation program and unit EM Representatives. See
   Figure 2.4, Air Force Emergency Management Program Structural Relationships –
   Installation Level.

Figure 2.4. Air Force Emergency Management Program Structural Relationships –
Installation




NOTE: This diagram shows the relationship between specific working groups, rather than all
working groups on an installation.
      2.4.1.1. The Installation Force Protection Executive Committee (FPEC) (not shown in
      Figure 2.4) is chaired by the Installation Commander. The FPEC receives advice and
      support from the EMWG and the FPWG. See Figure 2.4, Air Force EM Program
      Structural Relationships – Installation Level. MAJCOMs may direct specific deviations
      based upon the installation’s mission and command structure.
      2.4.1.2. The Installation EMWG is chaired by the Mission Support Group (MSG)
      Commander. The chairperson appoints members and establishes working subgroups.
      Representatives from civilian agencies may be invited to discuss functional issues. The
      EMWG coordinates with the EET to review EM program training status; schedule and
      design EM exercises; monitor CEMP 10-2 updates; monitor mutual aid agreement
      (MAA) updates; review SAV and exercise trends; monitor AFIMs and CBRNE defense
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                        19


     equipment shortfalls; coordinate new AFIMS TTP and initiatives; review the installation
     augmentation program IAW AFPAM 10-243, Augmentation Duty; and facilitate
     computer-based training equipment for the base populace. The EMWG coordinates with
     the FPWG to prevent duplication of effort. The EMWG will determine which specialized
     teams are required to support the installation EM program and what each team’s
     composition will be. The EMWG also reviews installation-wide programs for the ability
     to achieve EM program objectives. As a minimum the EMWG will have a subgroup for
     the Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Emergency Planning Team. The purpose of this
     team will be to address training, equipment and response options and standards for
     HAZMAT incidents, and if tasked to CBRN events. The CE Asset Management Flight
     Chief will chair the HAZMAT Emergency Planning Team. This team will meet as
     necessary or as tasked. Typical minimum members for the HAZMAT Emergency
     Planning Team are asterisked (*) below. The EMWG meets semiannually unless the
     chairperson requires meetings more frequently. Typical minimum Installation EMWG
     members include:
              Air Force Office of Special Investigations    * Logistics Readiness Squadron
              Air Reserve Component tenants                 * Medical representatives

              representative
              Judge Advocate                                * Maintenance Group
              representative
     2.4.1.2. (AEDC) Contractor membership on the EMWG will be determined jointly by
     the Contractor’s Support Services Director and 704 CES/CC. EMWG members will be
     appointed in writing and the letter of appointment will be maintained by the Operating
     Contractor’s EM office.
     2.4.1.3. The Installation FPWG is the commander’s cross-functional working group
     formed IAW AFI 10-245 and made up of wing and tenant units. Working group members
     coordinate and provide deliberate planning for AT and FP issues.
     2.4.1.4. The Installation TWG is required IAW AFI 10-245 as an antiterrorism and force
     protection advisory body for the commander. Key functions include analyzing threats and
20                                          AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011


     providing recommendations to commanders concerning potential FPCON changes, AT
     and other measures based upon potential threats to facilities or personnel.
  2.4.2. At installation level, the DRF is the structure for response. The DRF includes the
  ICC/CAT, Command Post, Emergency Communications Center (ECC), EOC, Incident
  Commander, First Responders (see paragraph 2.4.2.6), Emergency Responders (see
  paragraph 2.4.2.7), Unit Control Centers (UCC), ESFs, and specialized teams. These terms
  are defined in Attachment 1.
  2.4.2. (AEDC) The Crisis Action Team (CAT) and Emergency Operations Center (EOC)
  are teams established to provide additional command and control. Team members shall be
  appointed in writing and will be scheduled for initial training within 30 days of appointment.
  The Operating Contractor’s Operations Center is tasked to train the CAT. The Operating
  Contractor’s EM Office is tasked to train the EOC. Refresher training will be accomplished
  annually and may be credited through classroom instruction, participation in an exercise, or
  an actual emergency.
     2.4.2.1. The ICC directs strategic actions supporting the installation's mission. The
     command post is part of the ICC, which functions as the essential C2 node. The ICC
     provides a communication link with higher headquarters and with civilian agencies. As
     the focal point for installation-wide warning and notification and operation, the ICC
     communicates directions and information and also recommends courses of action
     concerning the incident. The ICC controls the Commander’s Senior Staff, EOC, and
     UCCs. The Installation Commander serves as the senior leader of the ICC.
     2.4.2.2. The Commander’s Senior Staff is a limited staff formed when the crisis
     resolution does not require formation of the entire ICC. It is activated for a specific
     incident to command, control, and coordinate the required support. The size and
     composition of the Commander’s Senior Staff is scalable to support the Installation
     Commander’s requirements. It usually requires a team chief and functional experts to
     respond to a specific situation. See Attachment 1 for a more complete definition.
     2.4.2.3. The ECC includes a central dispatch capability or its interim equivalent for the
     installation. It should include the minimum functions of Fire Alarm Communications
     Center (FACC), SF Desk, and Medical dispatch (when applicable). The ECC may be
     virtual until a central facility can be established. The central dispatch capability is a goal
     that installations must work towards while using current assets. The interim virtually-
     consolidated configurations are considered to be in compliance with this guidance until
     the central dispatch capability can be achieved. Existing resources should be used as
     backup capabilities once physical consolidation occurs.
     2.4.2.4. The EOC is the C2 support elements that directs, monitors, and supports the
     installation’s actions before, during, and after an incident. The EOC is activated and
     recalled as necessary by the Installation Commander. The EOC updates the ICC with
     ongoing incident status and seeks support through the ICC when on-scene requirements
     surpass the installation’s inherent capability and the installation’s cumulative capabilities
     acquired through MAAs. EOCs may also support MCS and joint information activities.
     See Figure 2.5, On-Base and Off-Base Emergency Management Comparison. Core
     functions of the EOC must include the following:
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                      21


       2.4.2.4. (AEDC) The primary EOC location is the A&E, bldg No. 100, Room A-101D.
       The secondary EOC location is located in the Large DO Conference Room bldg
       No.1099.
          2.4.2.4.1. Coordination.
          2.4.2.4.2. Communications, including exchanging data with First and Emergency
          Responders, the Mobile Communications Center (MCC) or the Mobile Emergency
          Operations Center (MEOC).
          2.4.2.4.3. Resource dispatch and tracking.
          2.4.2.4.4. Information collection, analysis, and dissemination.

Figure 2.5. On-Base and Off-Base Emergency Management Comparison.




NOTE: The Secretary of State coordinates international activities related to the prevention,
preparation, response, recovery, and mitigation for domestic incidents and to protect United
States citizens and United States interests overseas.
       2.4.2.5. The Incident Commander (IC) is a trained and experienced responder who
       provides on-scene tactical control using subject matter experts (SME) and support from
       other functionals. Normally, ICs are SMEs from the Fire, Medical, or SF response
       elements. The IC will use the AFIMS to manage the incident.
          2.4.2.5.1. Depending upon the situation, other personnel may function as ICs if they
          have completed Incident Command System (ICS) training IAW Chapter 6 and meet
          DOD and Federal certification standards for the specific type of incident. For
22                                         AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011


        example, the IC must meet Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 6055.6, DOD
        Fire and Emergency Services Program and Department of Defense Manual (DODM)
        6055.6, DOD Fire and Emergency Services Certification Program, requirements for
        HAZMAT and suspected CBRNE responses. FES personnel serve as IC for EOD
        incidents during peacetime and terrorist response incidents after SF have contained or
        neutralized any hostile forces.
        2.4.2.5.2. Federal certification standards for ICs do not currently exist for some
        incidents such as biological disease outbreaks. When no certification standard exists,
        the Installation Commander may appoint the appropriate SME as IC. For example,
        the Public Health Emergency Officer (PHEO) could be the IC for a biological
        incident. As the NIMS Integration Center develops qualification and certification
        standards, guidelines, and protocols, the Air Force will adopt them and ensure SMEs
        are adequately trained.
     2.4.2.6. First Responders, as defined by AFIMS, are members of the DRF elements that
     deploys immediately to the disaster scene to provide initial C2, to save lives, and to
     suppress and control hazards. Firefighters, law enforcement and security personnel, key
     emergency medical personnel provide the initial, immediate response to major accidents,
     natural disasters, and CBRNE incidents. All First Responders are Emergency
     Responders, but not all Emergency Responders are First Responders. First Responder
     duties have priority over other assigned duties.
     2.4.2.7. Emergency Responders, as defined by AFIMS, are members of the DRF
     response elements that deploy after the First Responders to expand C2 and provide
     additional support. Emergency Responders include follow-on firefighters, law
     enforcement personnel, security personnel, and emergency medical technicians, as well
     as EM and operations personnel, EOD personnel, physicians, nurses, medical treatment
     providers at medical treatment facilities, CE Readiness personnel, public health officers,
     bioenvironmental engineering, mortuary affairs personnel, and other specialized team
     members. Emergency Responder duties have priority over other assigned duties.
     Emergency Responders are not assigned as augmentees or to additional duties that will
     conflict with their emergency duties.
     2.4.2.8. The Emergency Support Functions (ESF) capabilities are grouped into an
     organizational structure that provides support, resources, program implementation, and
     services that are most likely to be needed during an incident. Installation ESFs serve as
     the primary operational-level mechanism. Personnel assigned to direct ESFs must be
     highly knowledgeable with decision-making authority for their function. See Attachment
     2, Emergency Support Functions for more information. The ESF Annexes of the NRP
     provide additional discussion on roles and responsibilities of ESF coordinators, primary
     agencies, and support agencies.
     2.4.2.9. The EOC Director is the MSG Commander or other senior representative
     designated by the Installation Commander. The EOC Director provides oversight for the
     Installation Commander to support and control emergency response to incidents. The
     EOC Director can support multiple ICs simultaneously, while providing senior officer
     level C2 for sustained response and recovery operations. If senior military authority or
     assessment is required on scene, the EOC Director or designate can move from the EOC
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                        23


     to the incident site. Before leaving the EOC, the EOC Director must appoint and brief a
     replacement. The replacement must meet the same training requirements as the EOC
     Director (see Chapter 6). On scene, the Incident Commander maintains legal authority
     and tactical control, including establishing a National Defense Area (NDA) with the
     advice of the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA). The EOC Director serves as the senior military
     representative to maintain military command authority over military resources as required
     by law.
     2.4.2.10. UCCs provide mission support to the Incident Commander as directed by the

       understand that when the RST is recalled, RST becomes an RST member’s primary duty.
       3.12.1.2. Shelter Management Team (SMT). The SMT is comprised of two elements,
       unit personnel assigned and trained to perform management duties and sheltered
       personnel identified by the shelter supervisor to augment trained personnel.
       3.12.1.3. Contamination Control Teams (CCT). These teams are comprised of unit
       personnel who perform contamination control measures specific to the incident. Unit
       personnel fill all CCT positions. Units that must have threat-based CCTs include
       Transportation, Maintenance, Munitions, Medical, and Civil Engineers.
       3.12.1.4. Post Attack Reconnaissance (PAR) Team. PAR teams are organized, trained
       and equipped by the unit. The minimum size for a PAR team is two people so one person
       can watch for hazards, provide security and call for assistance if needed.

                                            Chapter 4

     AIR FORCE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) PROGRAM PLANNING,
                      THREATS AND RESPONSE

4.1. Purpose. This chapter provides an overview of the AFIMS phases of incident
management. It discusses general information concerning the major EM threats, delineates
policy for each type of incident and summarizes the phases of incident management as they
apply to that type of incident.
4.2. General. The primary objective of EM program planning is to support Air Force plans by
minimizing effects caused by all-hazards incidents. EM program planning addresses a wide
range of threats for the Air Force. The Air Force EM program implements the AFIMS based on
NIMS methodology and includes the NRP standardized phases of incident management:
prevention, preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation. These phases of incident
management are discussed in paragraph 4.5.
   4.2.1. Installations, including tenant units, will tailor their response capability to the
   installation’s mission and threat assessment. Commanders must stress both planning and
   response to provide unity of effort, allocate resources efficiently and identify shortfalls early.
   Force survivability and mission continuation are the highest priorities for planning.
   4.2.2. The planning goals listed below are not in priority order:
      4.2.2.1. Decentralize vital operations and mission-critical resources.
      4.2.2.2. Disperse, shelter, or cover response and recovery resources.
      4.2.2.3. Relocate, evacuate, or shelter all personnel affected or potentially affected by the
      incident.
      4.2.2.4. Provide IPE for FP and PPE for incident response and recovery.
      4.2.2.5. Improve protection for buildings used as shelters.
      4.2.2.6. Develop MAAs with civilian and host nation authorities.
      4.2.2.7. Provide information, notification and warning systems.
      4.2.2.8. Implement CBRNE detection, risk assessment, avoidance, control, plotting,
      predicting, warning and reporting measures.
      4.2.2.9. Provide information flow between C2 elements and the general installation
      populace.
      4.2.2.10. Provide recovery actions from effects of EM incidents.
      4.2.2.11. Provide survivable, interoperable communications.
      4.2.2.12. Ensure seamless operations with other Federal agencies in response to
      Catastrophic Events or Incidents of National Significance as defined by DODD 3025.15,
      NIMS and the NRP. Ensure plans support other Federal agencies during Incidents of
      National Significance.
 48                                          AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011


   4.2.3. Planning is based upon a threat assessment that enables commanders to identify
   minimum standards to train, organize, equip and protect forces. The CBRNE threat areas are
   shown in Table 4.1, Worldwide CBRNE Threat Area Table. This table was based upon the
   Threat Compendium: Worldwide Threat to Airbases and developed under the guidance of
   AF/A7CXR with support from HQ AFCESA/CEX, in coordination with MAJCOM Civil
   Engineers and cannot be changed without AF/A7CXR approval. The table is provided to
   assist with equipment planning and budgeting only. See Chapter 6 for training requirements.
   Installations must evaluate the current operations, intelligence reports, and risk assessments
   to determine the current local threat. CBRNE High, Medium, and Low Threat Areas are
   defined in Attachment 1.

Table 4.1. Worldwide Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield
Explosive (CBRNE) Threat Area Table.
         CBRNE Threat Area                 Geographical Location
      1. High Threat Area (HTA)            Bahrain, Balkans Region, Diego Garcia, Egypt, Greece,
                                           India, Israel, Jordan, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
                                           Pakistan, Qatar, Republic of China (Taiwan), Republic of
                                           Korea, Somalia, Singapore, Sudan, Thailand, Turkey, and
                                           United Arab Emirates
      2. Medium Threat Area (MTA)          Germany, Italy, Japan, and Yemen
      3. Low Threat Area (LTA)             All locations not listed as a high or medium threat area
NOTE: See the Threat Compendium: Worldwide Threat to Airbases for further threat-related
information.
   4.2.4. The nature of conventional and asymmetrical CBRNE weapons and their delivery
   systems makes positive identification of the type of attack difficult until after the attack has
   occurred. Commanders should tailor their forces and employ threat-specific countermeasures
   that mitigate risk to resources and personnel necessary to sustain operations. Intelligence and
   counterintelligence activities support EM by assessing enemy order of battle, means of
   delivery, weapons type, or agent fill and the conditions under which hostile forces may
   employ these weapons.
4.3. Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2. The installation CEMP
10-2 provides comprehensive guidance for emergency response to physical threats resulting from
major accidents, natural disasters, conventional attacks, terrorist attack, and CBRN attacks. As
such it is intended to be a separate installation plan and will not be combined with other plans
until HQ USAF develops and fields a template and provides implementation guidance. All
installations must develop a CEMP 10-2 using the AF template to address the physical threats to
their base. During deployments, commanders may need to use other plans, such as the
Expeditionary Support Plan (ESP) prepared IAW AFI 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary
Site Planning, to provide EM-specific execution tasks until a CEMP 10-2 is developed.
Sufficient resources may not be available early in a deployment to implement a comprehensive
EM program. The CEMP 10-2 should be coordinated with OPRs of other installation plans such
as the AT Plan 31-101, Base Defense Plan, MCRP, ESP and Installation Deployment Plan. The
CEMP 10-2 must be coordinated through all tasked agencies and should be coordinated with all
units/agencies on the installation. Any conflicts with other plans must be resolved before
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                              49


publication. Readiness and Emergency Management Flights will provide an information copy of
the CEMP 10-2, unless it is classified, to local civilian agencies as part of their total coordination
effort.
   4.3.1. Each installation unit, including tenants, must use the CEMP 10-2 template to develop
   unit-specific checklists to support the installation CEMP 10-2. Checklists must tell who,
   what, when, where and how actions will be accomplished. Each unit must develop checklists
   for each specialized team they control. Once checklists are complete and before
   implementation, they must be approved by the unit commander and coordinated through the
   Readiness and Emergency Management Flight.
   4.3.2. MAJCOMs may provide specific EM program requirements for their installations,
   including MAJCOM instructions for program management, exercise and administrative
   information. Response must conform to AFIMS.
   4.3.3. DRUs, FOAs and NAFs support the EM Program as directed by their MAJCOM.
   DRUs and FOAs that report directly to the Chief of Staff, US Air Force, will maintain a
   current, executable EM plan and supporting checklists.
   4.3.4. GSUs are not required to develop a CEMP 10-2, but they must develop EM operating
   procedures and coordinate them with the host CE Readiness Flight. MAJCOMs will
   supplement this instruction with guidance for host installations to identify specific support
   requirements for off-base units in the CEMP 10-2.
   4.3.5. Review documents that address elements of the Air Force EM program when
   developing the CEMP 10-2. Documents to review include intelligence reports, training and
   equipment standards, installation plans, MAAs, ESPs and joint support plans. Integrate the
   capabilities provided by other documents, or cross-reference them to avoid duplication.
   4.3.6. Classify and handle the CEMP 10-2 IAW AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
   Management. Three options are available for CEMP 10-2 classification:
       4.3.6.1. The plan should be unclassified to ensure maximum distribution, but designated
       For Official Use Only.
       4.3.6.2. If portions of the plan are classified, those portions must receive appropriate
       handling and should be distributed separately IAW AFI 31-401.
       4.3.6.3. If the entire plan is classified, follow instructions in AFI 31-401.
   4.3.7. The plan lists key actions commanders and tasked agencies must accomplish based on
   the threat. Annexes should not repeat the main plan. Base the plan on the template located on
   the Air Force Portal. When EM guidance is included in another plan, such as the ESP or
   WMP-1, reference the other plan but do not repeat the guidance. The CEMP 10-2 has five
   annexes. NOTE: Disease containment planning has applicability to multiple annexes.
   Naturally occurring disease outbreaks, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or
   pandemic flu, are considered a natural disaster and are addressed in Annex B. Biological
   warfare attack can come from a traditional adversary (Annex C) or from a terrorist group
   (Annex D). Because Air Force disease containment planning is biological attack-focused, it
   is referenced in Annex C, CBRNE Attack. Annexes B and D will cross-reference to Annex
   C when planning for a naturally occurring disease outbreak or terrorist use of biological
   weapons.

       4.3.7.1. Annex A: Major Accidents.
       4.3.7.2. Annex B: Natural Disasters.
       4.3.7.3. Annex C: Enemy CBRNE Attacks. Unless specifically mandated by MAJCOMs,
       CONUS bases that determine they have a low threat from this kind of action are not
       required to write this annex.
       4.3.7.4. Annex D: Terrorist Use of CBRNE.
       4.3.7.5. Annex Z: Distribution. NOTE: Disease containment planning has applicability
       to multiple annexes. Naturally occurring disease outbreaks, such as Severe Acute
       Respiratory Syndrome or pandemic flu, are considered a natural disaster and are
       addressed in Annex B. Biological warfare attack can come from a traditional adversary
       (Annex C) or from a terrorist group (Annex D). Because Air Force disease containment
       planning is biological attack-focused, it is included in Annex C, CBRNE Attack.
       Annexes B and D will cross-reference to Annex C when planning for a naturally
       occurring disease outbreak or terrorist use of biological weapons.
4.4. Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2 Functional
Checklists. Each installation unit, including tenants, must develop unit-specific checklists
supporting the CEMP 10-2 within 30 days of publication. See paragraph 4.3.1.
4.4. (AEDC)In addition to response checklists, all units on AAFB shall develop checklists
designed to protect their assigned personnel. Unit specific checklists shall address such topics
to include, but not be limited to, building evacuation with specific rally points, phone numbers,
recall procedures, and any other details set forth by applicable directives based on the unit’s
mission at AAFB. All units will submit copies of their completed checklists to Operating
Contractor’s EM Office.
4.5. Standard Phases of Incident Management. The NIMS and the NRP state that the five
phases of incident management are prevention, preparedness, response, recovery and mitigation.
These phases of incident management have been incorporated into AFIMS and provide the
framework with which the installation DRF responds to all EM events. Comprehensive
definitions of these phases are included in Attachment 1. Actions that were traditionally
considered to be pre-event or pre-attack actions are considered to be prevention, preparedness
and mitigation actions under AFIMS. Actions that were traditionally considered to be trans-event
or trans-attack actions are considered to be response or mitigation actions under AFIMS. Actions
that were traditionally considered to be post-event or post-attack actions are considered to be
recovery or mitigation actions under AFIMs. Under AFIMS, the DRF includes the ICC, the
EOC, the ECC, the IC, First Responders and Emergency Responders, UCCs and specialized
teams. The DRF is used to respond to all incidents, although it may be configured differently
depending upon the incident.
   4.5.1. For AFIMS, prevention includes broad categories of activities such as intelligence
   collection and analysis, active defense, proliferation prevention, fire prevention, disease
   prevention and contamination prevention. Prevention also includes more specific tasks such
   as Safety Mishap Investigations that contribute information to prevent future mishaps.
   4.5.2. For AFIMS, preparedness includes actions such as planning discussed in Chapter 4,
   the Air Force EM training covered in Chapter 6 and the Air Force EM exercise and
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                          51


   evaluation covered in Chapter 7. Preparedness also includes specific tasks such as
   identifying augmentation manpower needs or reviewing ESPs.
   4.5.3. For AFIMS, response includes deploying the DRF (see Chapter 4), executing the
   CEMP 10-2 (this chapter) and notification and warning (see Chapter 9).
      4.5.3.1. Imminently serious conditions resulting from any civil emergency or attack may
      require immediate action by military commanders to save lives, prevent human suffering,
      or mitigate great property damage.
      4.5.3.2. When such conditions exist and time does not permit prior approval from higher
      headquarters, local military commanders and responsible officials of other DOD
      components can respond to civil authorities’ requests, with follow-on reporting through
      the appropriate command chain as soon as possible.
   4.5.4. For AFIMS, recovery includes operations such as implementing casualty treatment,
   unexploded ordnance (UXO) safing, Contamination Control Area (CCA) processing, airfield
   damage repair and facility restoration. Recovery planning and actions begin as soon as
   possible to ensure sustainment of crucial missions and restoration of normal operations.
   4.5.5. For AFIMS, mitigation includes general measures. Mitigation is an ongoing process
   and is considered, to some degree, a part of every phase of incident management. In a global
   sense, mitigation includes all activities designed to reduce or eliminate risks to persons or
   property or to lessen the actual or potential effects or consequences of an incident. See the
   NRP for a more detailed discussion of mitigation during all phases of incident management.
   See also paragraphs 4.6.6.5, 4.7.4.5, 4.8.4.5 and 4.9.4.5 for discussions of how mitigation is
   applied during each type of incident.
4.6. Major Accidents, Including Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT).
   4.6.1. The Air Force EM program addresses major accident responses through this
   instruction, while the Air Force Safety program addresses mishaps through AFI 91-204.
   Major accidents are defined in paragraph 4.6.2. Mishaps are defined in paragraph 4.6.2.2.
   The differences between major accidents and mishaps are discussed in paragraph 4.6.3.
   4.6.2. A major accident is an accident of such a magnitude as to warrant response by the
   installation DRF. It differs from day-to-day emergencies and incidents that are routinely
   handled by base agencies without the DRF. A major accident may involve one or more of the
   following:
      4.6.2.1. Hazardous substances, such as radioactive materials, TIC/TIMs, or explosives.
      4.6.2.1. (AEDC) AAFB HAZMAT response shall be conducted in accordance with
      Safety Standard E17, Oil & Hazardous Substance Spill Response; Appendix 1 to Annex
      A of CEMP 10-2, Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) Response Checklist; and AFMAN 32-
      4004, Emergency Response Operations.
      4.6.2.2. Class A Mishap. A mishap is an unplanned occurrence or series of occurrences
      that results in damage or injury and meets Class A, B, C, or D mishap reporting criteria
      IAW AFI 91-204. Specific examples include damage to DOD property, occupational
      illness to DOD military or civilian personnel, injury to DOD military personnel on- or
      off-duty, injury to on-duty DOD civilian personnel, damage to public or private property,
      or injury or illness to non-DOD personnel caused by Air Force operations. Class A
52                                           AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011


     mishaps may be categorized as major accidents, depending upon the situation and the
     need for the DRF.
     4.6.2.3. Extensive property damage.
     4.6.2.4. Grave risk of injury or death to personnel.
     4.6.2.5. Adverse public reaction.
  4.6.3. The relationship between major accidents and mishaps may be misleading because the
  definition of a mishap is broader than the definition of a major accident. A mishap includes
  all major accidents, plus some minor accidents, plus occupation illnesses and injuries to
  individuals. Conversely, the scope of an actual major accident may far exceed the scope of an
  actual mishap. For example, a mishap may occur where only one person is injured in an
  industrial accident, less than $20,000 of direct cost is involved, or an injury does not result in
  any loss of time from work. This mishap would not be considered a major accident and
  would not require a DRF response. Major accidents differ from the minor day-to-day
  emergencies and incidents that installation agencies typically handle. All major accidents are
  considered mishaps, but not all mishaps are considered major accidents.
  4.6.4. Examples of major accidents include nuclear weapon accidents, nuclear reactor
  facility accidents, HAZMAT spills, aircraft crashes and fires. Through the CEMP 10-2, the
  Air Force plans response for specific types of major accidents such as HAZMAT incidents or
  aircraft accidents.
  4.6.5. The DOD must respond to major accidents involving DOD resources or resulting from
  DOD activities. AFI 10-206 and AFI 91-204 provide reporting requirements for mishaps
  involving Air Force equipment or personnel.
     4.6.5.1. The installation must plan, equip and train to provide immediate, decisive
     incident response anytime an incident occurs on the installation. Additionally, the
     installation may respond immediately if the effects of an incident on or off an installation
     extend to or involve surrounding civilian communities or when the need to save lives,
     prevent human suffering or mitigate great property damage is a concern.
     4.6.5.1. (AEDC) Base organizations tasked to respond will maintain an equipment list
     reflecting their respective organizational response equipment to include amount on hand,
     location, and status (as applicable). This list will be provided to the Operating
     Contractor’s EM Office no later than one week prior to the organization’s scheduled
     annual SAV or on demand when required to support the EM program.
     4.6.5.2. The installation may respond immediately when acting under an immediate
     response condition, when acting IAW an existing MAA, or when civil authorities request
     assistance and time does not allow prior approval from higher headquarters. The
     installation must report any assistance provided as soon as possible. The installation
     should begin tracking all support expenditures as soon as response begins and continue
     until response ends. See AFI 10-802.
     4.6.5.3. For accidents involving nuclear weapons or their components, Installation
     Commanders must adhere to AF/PA policy IAW AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Policy and
     Procedures. They must provide effective PA activities near the scene of a nuclear
     weapon accident and speed the flow of information to the public and the internal
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                         53


     audience. In the United States, its territories, or its possessions, DOD policy requires the
     senior ranking military authority on scene, usually the Incident Commander, to confirm
     the presence of nuclear weapons or radioactive nuclear components in the interest of
     public safety or to reduce or prevent widespread public alarm. Public authorities must be
     notified if the public is, or may be, in danger of radiation exposure or other danger posed
     by the weapon or its components. Statements that confirm the presence of nuclear
     weapons should clearly address whether or not the possibility exists for exposure to
     radiation or injury from high explosive (HE) weapon components. Foreign theater
     commanders who have RTF responsibilities provide planning and exercise requirements
     for their supporting RTFs. Domestic MAJCOMs with RTF responsibilities, as discussed
     in Chapter 3, provide additional response procedures in their RTF plans.
     4.6.5.4. The Initial Response Base (IRB) coordinates directly with local officials until
     FEMA or host nation officials arrive. The IRB is the nearest military installation having a
     disaster response capability, regardless of size, to a major accident involving DOD
     resources. The Air Force IRB responds unless directed otherwise by the MAJCOM,
     theater, or AFOC. Installations must provide initial response to incidents involving
     nuclear weapons and must control the scene until relieved by higher authority. For
     nuclear weapons accidents, the IRB will proceed to the radiological accident or incident
     scene to render emergency assistance, including maintaining C2 of the accident site until
     relieved by the RTF. Subject to its capabilities, the IRB may be tasked to do the
     following: rescue operations, accident site security, fire fighting, initiation of EOD
     procedures, radiation monitoring, establishing C2 and communications, public affairs
     activities and casualty management.
     4.6.5.5. In accidents involving HAZMAT, the release of public information must comply
     with the specific instructions given in movement and plans or orders and DOD or
     overseas-unified command policies.
     4.6.5.6. Civil authorities oversee off-base response and recovery operations within the
     United States, its territories and possessions. DOS, DOD, COCOM, MAJCOM and
     SOFA describe civil jurisdiction and support for EM in all other areas.
        4.6.5.6.1. Involvement of military resources in an off-base response gives the Air
        Force no specific rights or jurisdiction unless an NDA is established.
        4.6.5.6.2. When directed by higher authority, the Air Force will support civil
        authorities to the maximum extent practical; however, the Air Force’s warfighting
        mission will take priority over support to civilian authorities.
  4.6.6. Major Accident Phases of Incident Management.
     4.6.6.1. Prevention. Major accident prevention includes many actions covered by Air
     Force programs such as the Safety Program IAW AFI 91-204. Although the Air Force
     EM program emphasizes the other phases of incident management, the prevention phase
     can save lives and minimize the need to use resources to respond and recover from major
     accidents.
     4.6.6.2. Preparedness. Examples of preparedness for major accidents include maintaining
     and testing the installation notification and warning system, developing and exercising
54                                         AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011


     installation recall procedures and certifying equipment. Another example of preparedness
     is publishing, testing and validating response procedures.
     4.6.6.3. Response. Major Accident Response has three overlapping phases – notification,
     response and withdrawal or evacuation.
        4.6.6.3.1. During notification, installation authorities receive notification of an actual
        or potential accident, C2 initiates response and the installation populace is notified.
        Typically, installations will use the primary and secondary crash nets to notify the
        Emergency Responders. Any necessary evacuation or sheltering begins. The
        command post alerts and recalls the EOC and notifies both higher headquarters and
        local civil authorities.
        4.6.6.3.2. Response begins when the First Responders deploy. First Responders
        approach the site, preferably from an upwind or crosswind direction, and perform
        initial lifesaving, rescue, suppression, containment and evacuation. During response,
        the IC arrives on scene to establish C2 and directs life saving, rescue, containment
        and mitigation. Response ends with the completion of fire or hazard suppression,
        emergency rescue, transportation of casualties to medical treatment facilities,
        securing of classified material or components and isolation of hazards.
        4.6.6.3.3. The IC decides whether to evacuate personnel from the hazard area or to
        shelter-in-place. Withdrawal occurs when response forces are in imminent danger or
        all response actions have been completed. Withdrawal may be immediate or planned.
        Evacuate people in immediate danger of a downwind hazard. Move victims away
        from the scene and away from responders when evacuating personnel.
     4.6.6.4. Recovery. Recovery operations begin as soon as possible but normally follow
     hazard mitigation and when all emergency response actions are completed. Hazard
     mitigation is the cumulative set of tasks focused on a specific hazard to reduce the risks
     and effects associated with that hazard. In addition, commanders use hazard mitigation to
     plan, prepare and respond effectively to a given hazard. The mitigation phase, in contrast,
     is a general series of actions that continue throughout all AFIMS phases to reduce all-
     hazards risks and effects. Transfer of command to recovery organizations takes place
     when hazard mitigation is complete. Some emergency response elements may remain on
     scene for safety purposes. The recovery phase restores the area and operations to normal
     conditions. The EOC develops a recovery plan, which is approved by the Installation
     Commander before it is implemented. The recovery plan must address all items in CEMP
     10-2, Annex A, Recovery Operations Checklist, including mishap investigation
     requirements.
     4.6.6.5. Mitigation. Mitigation of risks and effects from major accidents takes two
     primary forms. First, methodical planning to prepare and respond effectively to major
     accidents is accomplished by preparing and exercising plans. According to the NIMS, a
     mitigation plan is considered a subset of preparedness. The Air Force provides mitigation
     planning through the CEMP 10-2, the Mortuary and Services Search and Recovery Plan
     and others. Second, the installation mitigates the effects of major accidents by performing
     a careful and current hazards analysis considering the population and probable accidents
     and developing appropriate measures to mitigate the results.
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                            55


       4.6.6.6. All major accidents require the same basic response actions; however, some
       types of accidents require additional issues be considered. Every accident will present
       unique challenges. For example, advanced aerospace materials used in some aircraft can
       release composite fibers that are a known hazard to the respiratory tract, eyes and skin
       and can cause electrical equipment to arc and short. Safety precautions must be observed
       during emergency response, handling, cleanup and disposal. All First Responders must be
       trained on permanently and temporarily assigned installation-specific hazards.
          4.6.6.6.1. Temporary storage of government shipments includes DOE and DOT Safe
          Haven, Safe Parking Shipments and Secure Holding. Safe Haven provides Air Force
          support of military and military-sponsored shipments. Safe Parking provides
          temporary storage of DOE shipments of transuranic waste material. Secure Holding
          provides secure holding areas for commercial carriers transporting Arms,
          Ammunition and Explosives (AA&E), classified materials and Controlled
          Cryptographic Items (CCI) in the interest of public safety and national security.
          4.6.6.6.2. Accidents involving HAZMAT can cause serious problems for Air Force
          installations and the local community. Air Force policy is to comply with the
          emergency planning and notification provisions of the Superfund and Reauthorization
          Act (SARA) of 1986, Title III, Emergency Planning and Community-Right-to-Know
          Act (EPCRA). Installations must keep the State Emergency Response Commission
          (SERC) and LEPC informed of its emergency planning and notification efforts.
          Actions taken when responding to a HAZMAT emergency are identical to those taken
          for other major accidents; however, specific processes and emergency notification
          procedures must be followed during HAZMAT incidents. The core of most
          HAZMAT teams includes the First Responders from FES supplemented by
          Bioenvironmental, CE Readiness and EOD.
4.7. Natural Disasters.
   4.7.1. Natural disasters can create emergency conditions that vary widely in scope, urgency
   and degree of damage and destruction. Plan for worst-case scenarios for those natural
   disasters that could occur on or near the installation. Specific natural disasters will differ in
   scope and effects. Therefore, response, recovery and mitigation actions will vary. A national-
   level response will be required to help Air Force installations recover from extensive natural
   disasters.
   4.7.2. Natural disasters include earthquakes, extreme heat or cold, floods and flash floods,
   hurricanes or typhoons, landslides and mudflows, thunderstorms and lightning, tornadoes,
   straight-line winds (see Attachment 1 for definition), cyclones, tsunamis, volcanoes,
   wildland fires, avalanches, winter storms, and natural outbreaks of disease.
   4.7.3. Installations use the ICC and EOC for C2 of resources when responding to and
   recovering from natural disasters. MAJCOMs may choose to deploy all or part of their DRF
   to support installations affected by natural disasters when requested and directed.
   Commanders must be able to maintain the primary installation mission, save lives, mitigate
   damage and restore mission-essential resources and infrastructure after a natural disaster.
   Base the level of response and actions on the magnitude of the disaster and degree of
   damage.
56                                          AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011


  4.7.4. Natural Disaster Phases of Incident Management.
     4.7.4.1. Prevention. Most natural disasters cannot be prevented. Vaccination of personnel
     or the use of mass prophylaxis may prevent the spread of naturally occurring disease to
     installation personnel. For other disasters, installations can only take measures aimed at
     mitigating the effects of natural disasters. These measures are addressed under
     preparedness or mitigation.
     4.7.4.2. Preparation. Natural disaster preparedness includes any actions taken in
     anticipation of a natural disaster such as implementing the CEMP 10-2, Annex B and
     appropriate Appendices. Training and exercises are critical elements of natural disaster
     preparedness and should be emphasized at all levels. Commanders and staff agency
     chiefs must ensure procedures are developed for personnel notification, recall and
     accounting. They also must implement actions to protect resources and report injuries and
     damage. Units should integrate protective measures into the installation's overall
     preparations for a natural disaster. Examples of actions to take include implementing
     weather advisories and warning notifications, initiating treatment activities during natural
     outbreaks of disease, preparing installation housing residents to evacuate and developing
     MAAs with local civil authorities. The EM information program makes an important
     contribution to preparedness by emphasizing actions that installation personnel can take
     on their own such as hardening, securing, dispersing and evacuation preparations.
     4.7.4.2. (AEDC) All base organizations (government and contractor) will develop and
     maintain, in current status, a unit notification and recall procedure which identifies all
     assigned personnel. Information must include name, address, and contact phone number.
     4.7.4.3. Response. As with major accidents, natural disaster response has three
     overlapping phases: notification, response and evacuation.
         4.7.4.3.1. The notification phase consists of actions taken in anticipation of a natural
         disaster. Actions may not be executable if a natural disaster occurs with little or no
         warning. During the notification phase, establish C2, notify the installation populace
         and response agencies, protect materials and facilities, consider sheltering or
         evacuating personnel, coordinate with civil authorities and begin collecting data for
         reports.
         4.7.4.3.2. During response, maintain C2, assess damage, conduct fire fighting,
         conduct search and rescue, prevent illness and injury, care for casualties, establish
         cordons, protect property, restore utilities and communications and continue
         collecting data for reports.
         4.7.4.3.3. Evacuation is defined in Attachment 1. Evacuation of aircraft before a
         hurricane often precedes the evacuation of installation personnel due to the
         arrangements that must be made at the receiving installation for the evacuating
         aircraft. People are also evacuated due to floods, forest fires and other natural
         disasters.
     4.7.4.4. Recovery. The recovery phase for natural disasters consists of actions taken after
     emergency actions have been implemented and lifesaving actions have been completed.
     All installation agencies may be involved in installation recovery following natural
     disasters. Recovery efforts restore the area and operations to normal conditions. Recovery
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                            57


      may involve dividing the installation into sectors and assigning each unit a sector for
      recovery actions if a natural disaster affects the entire installation. The EOC develops and
      implements a recovery plan that the Installation Commander approves. Desired outcomes
      of the recovery phase are to reestablish mission capability, prepare to handle personnel
      and claims actions, return to normal operations and provide necessary reports.
      4.7.4.5. Mitigation. Natural disasters can create emergency conditions that vary widely
      in scope, urgency and degree of damage. Installations must establish procedures and
      identify or obtain material to protect their resources from susceptible threats. Installations
      should pre-plan to isolate or shut off utilities, fuel and electrical and water systems that
      are affected by the natural disaster on or near the installation.
   4.7.5. Specific natural disaster responses will be required for the natural disasters listed in
   paragraph 4.7.2. Natural disaster responses may be modified during expeditionary
   operations.
      4.7.5.1. Consider the overall situation and threat when responding to natural disasters
      during expeditionary operations. Mission requirements and available resources will
      dictate procedures and priorities. Use the minimum resources possible to respond to the
      natural disaster and its effects without impairing mission capability. See Attachment 1
      for definitions of expeditionary operations and expeditionary units.
      4.7.5.2. The Installation Commander decides whether to evacuate or to shelter-in-place.
      4.7.5.3. Commanders of expeditionary operations must coordinate evacuation planning
      at the local, theater and DOS levels.
4.8. Contingency and Wartime Attack with Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear,
and High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Weapons (referred to hereafter as CBRNE Attack).
   4.8.1. All units must develop contingency plans and conduct training and exercises for both
   their home station and their deployment location. They must develop plans, training,
   contingency response checklists and exercises based upon a realistic threat and assessment of
   resources that will be available in a contingency. Naturally occurring disease outbreaks, such
   as pandemic influenza, may create operational challenges similar to those of a biological
   attack, while also presenting unique circumstances. Response actions will be similar for both
   situations. Plans, training, and response checklists and exercises must take these
   circumstances into account. Deliberate plans that rely upon in-place resources, such as a
   hardened facility or collective protection facilities, may not be executable at austere
   locations, especially during the response and recovery phases. Units must train and exercise
   their forces to develop alternate methods or work-around procedures if critical resources are
   destroyed or if mutual-aid resources, host nation support or incoming forces are unavailable.
   4.8.2. The CBRNE attack threat may come from traditional CBRNE weapons or may be new
   compounds and organisms. Military involvement to advance and protect US interests may
   include war operations, peace operations, homeland defense and civil support, foreign
   humanitarian assistance and other DSCA. Commanders must consider the impacts of a
   potential adversary's CBRNE abilities in the geographic region. Attacks can come from a
   wide array of conventional or asymmetrical threats, including missiles, artillery, mortar,
   unmanned aerial vehicles, Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Devices (VBIED), IEDs,
   vehicle sprayers, backpack sprayers, aircraft, or ground forces. Adversaries may use CBRNE

  weapons and other materials in a widespread manner or in a limited, focused manner to
  achieve specific effects.
     4.8.2.1. The AFOSI and intelligence communities conduct local threat assessments
     annually, when significant threat changes occur and before deployments.
     4.8.2.2. Each installation must conduct vulnerability assessments IAW AFI 10-245.
     Forces that are deployed as part of a fragmented UTC should be briefed on the most
     recent deployed location vulnerability assessment.
     4.8.2.2. (AEDC) The Base Antiterrorism Officer (ATO) is OPR for the Vulnerability
     Assessment Program.
     4.8.2.3. Annual reviews of the passive defense and consequence management programs
     may require adjustments to installation operations. Changes in threats or vulnerability
     assessments may also require revisions in planning and operations.
     4.8.2.4. JP 3-11, Joint Doctrine for Operations in Nuclear, Biological and Chemical
     (NBC) Environments, provides a framework to assess the threat posed by an adversary
     possessing, or suspected of possessing, CBRN weapons.
  4.8.3. Installation Commanders must provide the maximum possible protection for assigned
  personnel, materiels, equipment and facilities against the effects of enemy attacks.
     4.8.3.1. Commanders must develop a plan appropriate to their mission and threat, such
     as the installation ESP or the CEMP 10-2. For example, during increased alert, unit
     commanders recall or provide instructions to personnel away from their home duty
     station. Commanders must develop plans that allow them to complete that recall in the
     most effective manner possible.
     4.8.3.2. CBRNE passive defense measures are designed to improve the capability of
     personnel to survive and sustain operations in CBRNE environments. The major elements
     are contamination avoidance, protection and contamination control.
     4.8.3.3. Protective actions are taken in stages equal to the immediacy and nature of the
     threat. Use MAJCOM and local instructions and the installation notification and warning
     systems to direct the proper protective posture. When there is strategic warning of an
     increased attack threat, forces will increase defense readiness IAW declared theater alert
     states and stages.
  4.8.4. CBRNE Attack Phases of Incident Management.
     4.8.4.1. Prevention. The EM Program cannot prevent CBRNE attacks. The only
     measures that help mitigate the consequences of CBRNE attacks are more appropriately
     addressed under preparedness, recovery, response and mitigation.
     4.8.4.2. Preparedness. Responders must be trained within their areas of responsibility to
     employ PPE, determine the extent of contamination, control entry and exit to contain the
     spread of contamination, decontaminate their own personnel and equipment, conduct
     mass decontamination, evacuate casualties and initiate recovery operations. They must
     participate in training and exercises to incorporate CBRNE response capabilities into
     ongoing operations. The Installation Commander should ensure that existing base shelters
     and facility shelter plans are evaluated to implement shelter in-place protection. Another
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                        59


     example of preparedness for terrorist use of CBRNE is to inspect and maintain CBRNE
     response equipment and supplies to ensure they are ready for immediate use.
        4.8.4.2.1. Many actions help prepare forces for operations in CBRNE threat areas.
        Such actions require a readiness strategy designed to train, equip and exercise forces
        to counter the expected threats. This strategy includes training and equipping
        personnel, identifying shortfalls and limiting factors and developing or reviewing
        installation and joint support plans.
        4.8.4.2.2. The EM program must integrate with other efforts, such as physical
        security, critical infrastructure protection and preventive medicine, to provide the
        total force preparedness against all threats. Other examples of necessary steps include
        assigning areas of responsibility for PAR teams or establishing environmental and
        medical baselines for the installation such as those required by AFI 41-106, Medical
        Readiness and Planning; AFI 48-102, Medical Entomology Program; AFOSHSTD
        48-8, Controlling Exposures To Hazardous Materials; and AFI 48-119, Medical
        Service Environmental Quality Programs.
     4.8.4.3. Response. Actions taken before, during and after the attack are critical to force
     survivability and mission continuation. All personnel must know the meanings of the
     alarm conditions and MOPP levels; actions to take; where and how to take cover, how to
     report enemy sightings, provide owner-user security and wear IPE. They must perform
     self monitoring for signs and symptoms of chemical or biological exposure. Specific
     plans and procedures may be required to continue mission operations and must be
     coordinated with and supported by EM plans.
     4.8.4.4. Recovery. Successful recovery efforts require a coordinated and integrated
     approach. The recovery concept involves a combined effort from personnel trained to
     operate as a team, using specialized equipment to spearhead recovery efforts. The EOC
     will provide C2 for recovery operations and direct team efforts for damage assessment
     after an attack. The commander must direct actions that determine the extent of
     contamination and damage. Then, the ICC, with advice from the EOC, must establish,
     prioritize and direct recovery actions to restore mission capability and protect personnel.
     Only personnel involved in the recovery actions should be allowed outside until hazards
     have been identified and marked. Each unit and facility will assign and control PAR
     teams. These teams will report to their UCC, which will provide the reported information
     to the EOC.
     4.8.4.5. Mitigation. Mitigation measures against CBRNE attack include actions such as
     vulnerability and threat assessments. Mitigation also includes developing and testing the
     shelter program to provide the best available physical protection for personnel from the
     effects of an attack. As with all incidents, an important form of mitigation includes
     developing and implementing response plans, checklists and operating instructions. Also
     common to all mitigation efforts is the requirement to train and equip personnel,
     including specialized teams.
     4.8.4.6. The AFIMS structure will be used for CBRNE incident response by Air Force
     units including home station and expeditionary operations. The CEMP 10-2 provides
     checklists for shelter operations. The CBRNE attack checklist provides common tasks for
     CBRNE material and conventional attack response.

4.9. Terrorist Use of Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and High-Yield Explosive
(CBRNE) Materials, Including Toxic Industrial Chemicals or Toxic Industrial Materials
(TIC/ TIM).
   4.9.1. Terrorism, IAW the NRP, is "...any activity that involves an act that is dangerous to
   human life or potentially destructive of critical infrastructure or key resources; and is a
   violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State or other subdivision of the
   United States. This act appears to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; to
   influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or to affect the conduct of a
   government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping".
   4.9.2. Terrorist use of CBRNE materials is separated from CBRNE warfare because of the
   legal requirements for handling the terrorist incident as a crime scene and preserving
   evidence. All responders will be under close scrutiny and must be aware of evidence
   collection and preservation requirements. They must also be aware of the need to follow
   peacetime rules and regulations such as OSHA standards.
   4.9.3. Each installation is required to conduct vulnerability assessments annually IAW AFI
   10-245. The assessment must include the installation’s vulnerability to terrorist use of
   CBRNE materials.
   4.9.4. Terrorist Use of CBRNE Phases of Incident Management.
      4.9.4.1. Prevention. The EM Program cannot prevent terrorist use of CBRNE. The only
      measures that help mitigate the consequences of such attacks are more appropriately
      addressed under preparedness, recovery, response and mitigation..
      4.9.4.2. Preparation. Preparation for terrorist use of CBRNE parallels those actions listed
      in paragraph 4.8.4.2. Terrorist use of CBRNE materials is separated from CBRNE
      warfare because of the legal requirements for handling the terrorist incident as a crime
      scene and preserving evidence. This separation must be accounted for during planning,
      training, and equipping activities.
      4.9.4.3. Response. Response to terrorist use of CBRNE requires many of the same
      response actions as other types of incidents; however, responders must also establish and
      maintain a chain of custody for evidence preservation as directed by the IC. Responders
      must be alert for physical indicators and other outward warning signs of additional
      CBRNE events, including armed assault. Also, they must consider the potential for
      secondary attack, such as chemical dispersal devices, secondary explosive devices or
      booby traps.
      4.9.4.4. Recovery. Throughout the recovery phase, responders must continue to ensure
      that evidence is preserved. They may need to relinquish authority to the FBI or other
      authority for evidence collection or crime scene preservation, although life saving
      activities will always have priority over these actions. A mission recovery plan will be
      developed IAW CEMP 10-2. Recovery programs include mitigation components
      designed to avoid damage from future incidents. Long-term recovery may include
      cleanup and restoration.
      4.9.4.5. Mitigation. Mitigation occurs throughout preparedness, prevention, response and
      recovery. Responders must develop operational and tactical safety and security plans.
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                         61


       The installation must conduct and update the vulnerability assessment IAW AFI 10-245.
       The EOC must be prepared to deploy resources in response to specific threats or potential
       incidents. Another form of mitigation is ongoing educational activities designed to reduce
       loss of life and destruction of property.
4.10. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE)
Control Center. The CBRNE Control Center is managed under ESF 5, Emergency
Management. The control center is subordinate to the EOC director and serves as an advisory
element to the EOC and the Installation Commander. The control center directs CBRN
reconnaissance activities to shape the hazards and advises the commander on hazards,
countermeasures and protective actions. The CBRNE Control Center plots and maintains CBRN
hazards status on the airbase, in off-base areas of operational concern and at potential recovery
bases. The CBRNE Control Center also conducts CBRN and release other than attack (ROTA)
plotting and reporting activities IAW AF Tactic, Technique, Procedure (Interservice) (AFTTP(I))
3-2.56, Multi-service Tactics, Techniques and Procedures for CBRN Contamination Avoidance
or IAW MAJCOM guidance. These activities facilitate force survivability and mission
continuation for forces on and off the installation, both in the hazard area and in the downwind
hazard area. The CBRNE Control Center manages SMT, CCA and CCT operations and supports
installation warning and reporting and operations with United States joint service, coalition and
host nation forces. CBRNE Control Center personnel coordinate with medical, bioenvironmental
and intelligence representatives to provide advice to the commander. The control center may
include host nation CBRN defense specialists and may provide reciprocal manning at the host
nation control center.
4.10. (AEDC)The Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High Yield Explosive
(CBRNE) Control Center will be located within the EOC.

                                          Chapter 5

      AIR FORCE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) PROGRAM LOGISTICS

5.1. Purpose. This chapter provides Air Force EM program logistics information. Information
includes policy and guidance for funding, obtaining, and maintaining equipment and supplies to
support the Air Force EM program. It also provides information specific to use of AS,
installation EM response equipment, IPE, PPE, equipment storage and equipment funding, and
reporting.
5.2. General Information. Equipment must be available to mitigate incidents, restore, and
sustain mission operations, and train for EM situations. COCOM, MAJCOM, and installation
plans will identify types and quantities of EM equipment and supplies needed for each
employment area. Equipment is required for installation response functions such as the EOC and
UCCs, specialized teams, and individuals. Equipment, including communications equipment,
should be compatible with and interoperable with on-base and off-base agencies.
5.2. (AEDC)All tasked organizations (DoD, contractor and tenants) shall obtain, store, and
maintain equipment necessary to support the base EM Program, as required.
5.3. Allowance Standards (AS). An AS lists prescribed items and quantities of equipment that
can be purchased and made available for EM. Some items are not listed in the AS, such as
expendable items or supply catalog items. In addition, some CBRNE defense equipment items
are being processed into AS and are not yet listed. Such equipment is listed in the Baseline
Equipment Data Assessment List (BEDAL). Table 5.1 lists primary AS that prescribe items and
quantities of non-medical equipment to support the Air Force EM program. MEFPAK
Responsible Agent maintains AS for medical emergency response equipment.

Table 5.1. Non-Medical Allowance Standards (AS) for Emergency Management (EM)
Supplies and Equipment.
                Allowance
                          Title
                Standard
           1.   AS 016C   Chemical Warfare Defense Equipment (clothing and textiles)
           2.   AS 019    Vehicles
           3.   AS 459    CBRN equipment
           4.   AS 538    Small Arms and SF equipment
           5.   AS 660    Communications equipment
   5.3.1. To determine equipment needs, evaluate the installation or unit mission and threat;
   then purchase only the material needed to respond to that threat. Maintain spare parts for
   user-level maintenance. Base stock levels on anticipated consumption during scheduled
   maintenance, EM operations, training, and exercises.
   5.3.2. Needs may fall into various categories such as mobility, C2, EOC, UCC, team, and
   individual capabilities such as shelter management or detection. AFI 23-102, Operational
   Requirements Instructions for Determining Materiel Requirements for Reparable Items, and
   AFI 23-103, Determining Materiel Requirement for Air Force-Managed Consumable Items
   are two of several 23-series publications that provide detailed guidance on determining need.
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                       63


   Installations may not stock supplies solely for the purpose of DSCA, as directed in DODD
   3025.15, unless otherwise directed by the SecDef.
5.4. Installation Emergency Management (EM) Response Equipment. The Installation
Commander will ensure that all responders have adequate EM response equipment to respond to
any incident that threatens the installation. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs may specify minimum
equipment requirements for subordinate units. Installations must budget for, acquire, and
maintain equipment for natural disasters, major accidents or incidents, and response on or off
base.
   5.4.1. The CE Readiness Flight and the CBRNE Medical Defense Officer will address the
   status of installation EM response equipment, both medical and non-medical, at the EMWG
   meeting. Before the meeting, the CE Readiness Flight will review the consolidated list of
   non-medical EM response equipment requirements, then present this list to the EMWG. The
   EMWG will then prioritize the list for approval and inclusion in installation budget
   submissions. The EMWG will monitor funding allocation and acquisition to ensure the
   installation EM capability is subsequently established.
   5.4.2. The CBRNE Medical Defense Officer will provide a consolidated, prioritized list of
   EM medical equipment requirements through the EMWG to the installation FPEC. The
   medical list will be submitted to MAJCOM SG for coordination.
   5.4.3. The Installation Comptroller will coordinate the disbursement of EM program funding
   received from MAJCOM budget allocations through the EMWG to ensure funding is applied
   against the EMWG-approved consolidated non-medical EM priority equipment requirements
   list prescribed in paragraph 5.4.1.
   5.4.4. Team Equipment. Some personnel assigned to teams may require additional
   specialized protective equipment for their EM missions. Use the AS or BEDAL to validate
   these requirements.
   5.4.5. Mobile Communications. The Air Force will deploy three levels (Levels 1-3) of
   mobile communications capabilities to support AFIMS mobile incident response command
   and control. Level 1 capability would be thru existing assigned First Responder (Medical,
   Security Forces and Fire Emergency Services) vehicles with assigned tactical
   communications equipment. This will provide for 1 to 2 workstations for the incident
   management staff. Level 2 will be the Mobile Communications Center (MCC) vehicle with
   FEMA Type III communications capabilities. This will provide for 2 to 4 workstations and
   the ability to exchange on site data with the installation EOC. The installation EMWG will
   determine where the Level 2 requirement resides (i.e., Readiness and Emergency
   Management Mobile Command Post, Fire Chief’s vehicle, etc.). Existing Mobile Command
   Posts can be configured to meet this requirement. The Level 3 capability will be the Mobile
   Emergency Operations Center (MEOC) with FEMA Type II communications capabilities.
   This will provide for 4 to 6 workstations for incident management. Installation planners are
   encouraged to use FEMA 508-2 Typed Resource Definitions to determine C2
   communications equipment needs. Equipment selected should be compatible with
   surrounding local authority’s emergency responder capabilities to support mutual aid
   agreements and interoperability requirements. Any future purchases of MEOCs must be
   approved and funded by the MAJCOMs. Levels 2 and 3 are considered priority vehicles
   IAW AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations.

   5.4.5. (AEDC) The Mobile Emergency Operations Center (MEOC) Vehicle is assigned to
   Emergency Management and will be operated by the Operating Contractor’s EM Office. The
   MEOC will not be considered a dual purpose vehicle.
   5.4.6. CBRNE Incident Response Equipment. The BEDAL guides typical non-medical
   CBRNE incident equipment requirements for response to terrorist use of CBRNE.
   Information in the BEDAL will transition into the appropriate allowance standards. The
   equipment on the BEDAL is to build upon existing HAZMAT team equipment. The added
   equipment will allow response teams to continue limited mission operations and to
   eventually restore mission capabilities following a terrorist use of CBRNE. Equipment
   purchased to meet BEDAL guidance must be inventoried and accounted for using proper
   supply accountability procedures in accordance with AFMAN 23-110. Detailed guidance for
   accountability will be contained in supporting manuals to this AFI. Medical CBRNE Incident
   Response Equipment allowances are listed in the 886-series AS, which can be found on the
   Air Force Medical Logistics web site under "Medical Readiness".
   5.4.7. War reserve materiel (WRM) can be used to support domestic incidents, but approval
   will be obtained from the WRM releasing authority IAW AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel
   (WRM) Program Guidance and Procedures. When WRM is used to support domestic
   incidents, notify the approving authority as soon as possible.
5.5. Unit Emergency Management (EM) Response Equipment. Unit commanders must
identify requirements then budget for, obtain, store, and maintain material needed to accomplish
their specific functional EM tasks in support of response plans. Unit emergency response
equipment includes items to support unit EM missions such as shelter management, PAR, and
CCA team taskings. Unit equipment does not include items issued to individuals, such as IPE.
Units will maintain the minimum materials needed for tasked response and support. Supplement
or rotate consumable supplies and shelf-life-coded equipment with day-to-day operating stocks.
   5.5.1. Unit commanders must ensure unit material, including material in bulk storage, is
   properly maintained and inventoried. Units must budget to repair and replace equipment and
   consumables based on shelf-life expiration, service-life expiration, and unserviceable
   condition. Supplement or rotate this material with day-to-day operating stocks.
   5.5.2. Units must identify and mark training equipment IAW T.O.s. Do NOT store training
   equipment with operational equipment.
5.6. Program Element (PE) Codes. Units will use the PE codes in Table 5.2, EM-Related
Program Elements, to purchase authorized EM response equipment and supplies.

5.7. Individual Protective Equipment (IPE) and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
   5.7.1. IPE is personal clothing and equipment required to protect an individual from
   chemical, biological, and some nuclear effects in a CBRN-warfare environment. The
   protective mask also protects the respiratory tract from radioactive particles. IPE items may,
   but do not necessarily, meet the requirements of PPE for emergency response where
   Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or Air Force Occupational and
   Environmental Safety, Fire Protection, and Health (AFOSH) standards apply.
   5.7.2. The need to issue IPE is determined by the individual’s location in or deployment to
   the areas listed in Table 4.1, Worldwide CBRNE Threat Area Table or by the COCOM
   reporting instructions.
      5.7.2.1. All military and emergency-essential civilians in HTAs and MTAs are
      authorized C-1 and C-Bag sustainment assets. See Table 5.3, Air Force-Wide UTC
      Availability and Tasking Summary (AFWUS) Code/C-1 Bag Authorizations. AFWUS
      Codes are defined in AFI 10-401. Also, Table 5.4, CBRNE IPE, lists C-1 bag contents.
      Issue two complete operational ground crew ensembles (GCE) per C-1 bag and maintain
      remaining C-bag assets in the Logistic Readiness Squadron (LRS) to allow for shelter
      and contamination control area (CCA) stocking. All C-Bag and sustainment assets will be
      stored, issued, and deployed IAW MAJCOM guidance. Support installations will issue
      both training and real-world assets to personnel at subordinate GSUs.

      5.7.2.2. In LTAs issue a C-1 bag to military and emergency-essential civilians when they
      are tasked for deployment outside of an LTA. C-1 bags are authorized to meet the most
      stringent deployable tasking. LTA C-bag sustainment assets are centrally stored and
      deployed by the CMBCC.
      5.7.2.3. Personnel deploying for Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) deployments
      to MTAs or HTAs: C-bag items may be pre-positioned. Personnel will deploy IAW
      specific location and AOR reporting instructions. Personnel that will be TDY for 20 days
      or longer to a MTA or HTA, other than AEF locations, will bring a complete operational
      C-1 bag and related field gear, including helmet and body armor. Personnel participating
      in an MTA or HTA operations readiness exercise or inspection will bring training IPE
      components and a protective mask.
      5.7.2.4. MAJCOM A4 and A7 staffs, in coordination with MAJCOM/JA, will review
      host nation support agreements to determine if valid requirements exist to issue IPE to
      foreign nationals working on foreign Air Force installations. If valid requirements exist,
      MAJCOM A4 staffs will direct their installations’ LRS to determine and stock
      appropriate quantities of IPE. MAJCOM A4 staffs will also direct their installations to
      issue required IPE.
      5.7.2.5. Provide IPE to each United States government civilian and DOD contractor
      identified as emergency-essential and deployable to HTA or MTA areas. See DODI
      1400.31, Civilian Work Force Contingency and Emergency Planning and Execution, and
      DODI 3020.37, Continuation of Essential DOD Contractor Services During Crisis.
      5.7.2.6. LRS (or equivalent) will maintain a supply of chemical protective overgarments,
      gloves, inserts, and overboots for training and exercise purposes for participating Air
      Force military and civilian members. Use the same operational protective mask for both
      training and real-world operations. Individuals declared hard-to-fit by the
      Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight personnel during QNFT and issued an M-45 mask
      will deploy with the M-45 mask. Installations will procure and maintain CBRNE IPE.
      See Table 5.4.
   5.7.3. PPE is equipment designed to protect individuals exposed to hazards from injury or
   illness in non-military unique occupational environments where OSHA or AFOSH standards
   apply, including emergency response to CBRNE incidents in the United States.
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                    67


       5.7.3.1. At foreign locations, PPE for emergency response operations that meets OSHA
       or AFOSH standards may be required IAW Final Governing Standards, Overseas
       Environmental Baseline Guidance, and MAJCOM or COCOM policy.
       5.7.3.2. PPE used by Air Force emergency responders must be approved by the
       installation bioenvironmental engineer or Safety personnel (IAW AFOSH standards)
       before procurement and use. Where IPE meets appropriate PPE standards, the
       bioenvironmental engineer may approve IPE use as PPE for emergency response
       operations. Conversely, responders may use PPE when MOPP conditions are declared if
       the PPE meets or exceeds IPE protection and its use has been coordinated with the
       installation bioenvironmental engineer.
       5.7.3.3. Each installation DRF team or function will coordinate anticipated emergency
       response operations they will support under the installation CEMP 10-2, potential
       hazards, and PPE requirements with the local bioenvironmental engineer and Safety to
       determine the type and quantity of PPE required.
5.8. Funding and Reporting. Mobility bag funding and reporting procedures are completed
IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, USAF Supply Manual. MAJCOM/A4RS report mobility bag
status to Air Staff using the current RCS report format. MAJCOM/LGS or equivalent will send
a single, consolidated report to AF/A4RD. Subsequently, AF/A4RD will provide a consolidated
report to AF/A7CX. Installations submit reports to their MAJCOM IAW the schedule shown in
Table 5.5. Mobility Bag Reporting Schedule, unless directed otherwise by the MAJCOM.

  AIR FORCE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) PROGRAM EDUCATION AND
                          TRAINING

6.1. Purpose. This chapter provides Air Force EM program education and training policy and
guidance including objectives, responsibilities, requirements, and courses. Air Force EM
education and training applies to the all-hazards concept of integrating cross-functional
education and training into the Air Force EM program.
6.2. Training Objective. The objective of Air Force EM training is to provide the required
knowledge and skills to prepare for, prevent, respond to, recover from, and mitigate
contingencies or emergencies requiring Air Force response. AETC formal courses and
installation-level training increase knowledge and proficiency for response operations.
Additionally, Air Force EM education and training complies with Federal, DOD, Joint, and
national consensus standards in meeting training levels, frequency, and comprehensiveness. Air
Force EM education and training must include realistic exercises and scenarios demonstrating
the level of proficiency required for evaluation purposes.
6.2. (AEDC)Personnel assigned duties supporting emergency response operations shall be
scheduled for initial training within 30 days of assignment.
6.3. Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Education and Training Policy. The target
audience for Air Force EM education and training includes personnel specified in Table 6.1,
Major Accident and CBRNE Response Education and Training; Table 6.2, HAZMAT Minimum
Training and Certification Requirements, and Table 6.3, Air Force EM Program Education and
Training. Personnel will attend the courses listed in the tables to meet the level of proficiency
needed to accomplish their assigned tasks.
6.3. (AEDC)Group and Squadron Commanders and Directors (or Operating Contractor
Division Chiefs, as appropriate) are responsible for ensuring that assigned personnel
attend scheduled training. In addition, in-house training and in-house exercises shall be used
to enhance unit emergency operating procedures and to validate unit planning. Documentation
of such training and exercises will be maintained for a minimum of one year.
6.4. Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Education and Training
Requirements.
   6.4.1. Only military, civilian, or contractor personnel who complete the AETC Readiness
   Apprentice Course or CE Readiness Flight Officer Course may instruct courses listed in
   paragraph 6.6, unless otherwise specified. These instructors must be task certified and the
   certification documented annually by a CE Readiness Technician IAW AFI 36-2201,
   Volume 3. Military task certification is documented on AF Form 1098, Special Task
   Certification and Recurring Training and placed in the trainee’s AF Form 623, OJT Record.
   Civilian task certification will be documented in the employee’s records IAW AFI 36-401,
   Employee Training and Development, and contractors’ task certification will be documented
   IAW their contract or corporate requirements. New contracts for contracted CE Readiness
   Flight positions that include instructor duties must require completion of the AETC
   Readiness Apprentice Course or CE Readiness Flight Officer Course. Newly hired
   contractors must complete training before instructing or as soon as possible. Contractors

   System – Personnel Readiness (ACES-PR), Unit Scheduler Module to schedule personnel for
   Air Force EM education and training courses listed in paragraph 6.6 or in Table 6.3. Each
   unit is responsible for tracking completion and currency of their assigned personnel for all
   courses listed in this AFI.
   6.4.4. MAJCOM and responsible contracting offices must ensure service contracts that
   support personnel include training requirements. The required training must be
   commensurate with the training required of each individual’s military and Federal civilian
   employee counterparts. The equivalent training is required only for equivalent positions, not
   contractors who fulfill only some of the duties equivalent to the military or Federal civilian
   counterpart. This contract support is provided IAW AFI 63-124, Performance-Based
   Services Acquisition (PBSA).
   6.4.5. EET evaluators should not evaluate personnel who are serving in any position listed in
   Table 6.1, Table 6.2, or Table 6.3 until the evaluator has completed the same training
   required of the person being evaluated.
   6.4.6. Personnel assigned to the positions or functions listed in Table 6.2 must accomplish
   the appropriate HAZMAT training.
   6.4.7. CBRNE defense courses meet Air Force proficiency standards based on two
   international standardization agreements: NATO STANAG 2150 and Air Standardization
   Coordinating Committee (ASCC) Air Standard 84/8, Initial, Continuation and Unit NBC
   Training Standards.
   6.4.8. This AFI addresses aspects of passive CBRNE defense education and training.
   MAJCOMs, ANG, FOAs, and DRUs may tailor their Air Force EM education and training
   programs to their specific mission requirements by supplementing this AFI.
   6.4.9. Personnel going TDY to or deploying to an MTA or HTA must be current in CBRNE
   defense at the time of departure and for the duration of the TDY or deployment. They will
   receive local conditions training when they arrive at the TDY or deployment location.
   6.4.10. Aircrew members receive CBRNE defense education and training from several
   functional areas. Aircrew Life Support provides education and training on aircrew IPE and
   processing personnel through the aircrew contamination control area (ACCA). Flight
   Medicine provides training on agent toxicology and pharmacology. The CE Readiness Flight
   provides education and training on ground crew CBRNE operations and standards on a 20-
   month cycle.
   6.4.11. Personnel must be proficient in the wear of the protective mask before attending
   weapons qualification through the Air Force Qualification Course or the Tactical Rifle
   Qualification Course conducted by Air Force Combat Arms Training and Maintenance
   (CATM) instructors.
6.5. Education and Training Program Formats. Most courses in this chapter are currently
conducted and evaluated in a traditional instructor-led classroom or field environment. However,
Air Force EM education and training is transitioning to blended learning. Blended learning
includes two distinctive parts: individual knowledge-based objectives and individual
 76                                           AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011


demonstration-performance objectives. The use of blended learning standardizes education and
training objectives and increases student retention and comprehension.
   6.5.1. Individual knowledge-based objectives use Learning Management System (LMS)
   technologies via the web to deliver consistent, up-to-date education and training. This format
   allows academic self-paced learning and provides students increased access to course
   materials. Use of these technologies also allows for critical education and training data
   analysis at the installation and Air Force levels. Until each course is fielded, instructors will
   use the course proficiency standards for knowledge and performance outlined in the Air
   Force Readiness Training Packages (RTP).
       6.5.1.1. Completion of computer-based Air Force EM education and training products
       for courses discussed in this chapter becomes mandatory as they are fielded and IAW the
       accompanying product implementation guidance.
       6.5.1.2. Current CD-formatted Air Force EM education and training products are
       mandatory to complete until products are transitioned to a web-delivered format.
       6.5.1.3. A listing of fielded EM education and training products is located on the Air
       Force Portal. Web-delivered products can be found at https://golearn.csd.disa.mil/.
       6.5.1.4. (DELETED).
       6.5.1.5. Each individual must create an account on the Air Force EM program LMS site
       from a computer with military internet access. Once an account is created, EM education
       and training products can be accessed and completed from any computer with internet
       access.
       6.5.1.6. Personnel who need assistance determining course requirements, accessing
       course material, addressing technical issues, or have questions concerning EM training
       products should contact their Unit EM Representative, CE Readiness Flight or the HQ
       AFCESA Reach Back Center at DSN 523-6995 or 1-888-AFCESA1 (888-232-3721).
       Frequently asked questions concerning EM training products can be found on the Air
       Force Portal or on the Air Force EM program LMS site.
       6.5.1.7. Individual knowledge-based objectives must be completed within 15 consecutive
       days of start by active duty military, civilian, or contract personnel or within two Unit
       Training Assemblies (UTA) by ARC personnel. Group or team completion of individual
       knowledge-based objectives is not authorized.
   6.5.2. Individual demonstration-performance objectives focus on common core skills. After
   a student completes the knowledge-based objectives, CE Readiness Flight instructors will
   train and evaluate individual demonstration-performance objectives.
       6.5.2.1. Some courses listed in this chapter do not contain individual demonstration-
       performance objectives; however they contain localized procedures that must be
       presented to the individual by the CE Readiness Flight or other functional areas as
       identified in this chapter.
       6.5.2.2. Unit commanders must ensure personnel complete individual demonstration-
       performance objectives no later than 60 days after completing individual knowledge-
       based objectives.

         6.5.2.3. Duration for the demonstration-performance portion of education and training is
         approximate, based on covering Air Force standard demonstration-performance
         objectives, local procedures, and requirements. Duration is affected by student
         proficiency levels.
      6.5.3. Unless otherwise noted in this chapter, personnel do not receive credit for completing
      a course until both individual objectives have been completed.

   reconnaissance. The course provides IPE inspection, use, and wear procedures. See Figure
   6.1, CBRNE Defense Education and Training Process.

Figure 6.1. CBRNE Defense Education and Training Process.




      6.6.1.1. CBRNE Defense Orientation provides basic knowledge of the CBRNE threat,
      protective equipment and actions to survive a CBRNE attack or event. It is conducted
      during Basic Military Training School (BMTS) and is a one-time requirement, which
      prepares enlisted Airmen for the CBRNE Defense Awareness Course.
      6.6.1.2. CBRNE Defense Awareness Course consists of individual knowledge-based
      objectives that provide in-depth knowledge of CBRNE defense hazards and protective
      actions. The course provides instruction on IPE inspection, use and wear procedures and
      incorporates the explosive ordnance reconnaissance (EOR) training. CBRNE Defense
      Awareness Course consists of individual knowledge-based objectives that provide in-
      depth knowledge of CBRNE defense hazards and protective actions. Air National Guard
      and Reserve units are approved to use the following means in priority order to
      accomplish this training until their installation infrastructure supports individualized
      training via the ADLS; 1) Use the ADLS, ANG VLC, or AFRC VLC; 2) Stand alone
      computer based training using a stand alone CD-ROM (provided to ANGRC and HQ
      AFRC); 3) (ANG and AFRC ONLY) Instructor-led class of no more than 30 students
      using the HQ AFCESA approved PowerPoint presentation. En masse training for over
      30 students is not authorized. All UDMs, UTMs, and Unit Schedulers must ensure their
      personnel are given ample time to complete the web-based portions of the course. UDMs,
      UTMs, or Unit Schedulers will ensure each student completes the CBRNE Defense
      Awareness Course before being scheduled for the CBRNE Defense Survival Skills
      Course. NOTE: All newly commissioned officers are required to attend the Air Space
      Basic Course. Upon successful completion of this course these students receive credit for

     the CBRNE Defense Awareness and Survival Skills Course. NOTE: As subject matter
     experts, AFS 3E9X1 does not have to complete the CBRNE Defense Awareness or
     Survival Skills Courses.
        6.6.1.2.1. This web-delivered course is self-paced.
        6.6.1.2.2. The course is accomplished every 20 months by all Air Force personnel,
        regardless of deployment status or AFWUS coding. The exception to this policy is
        students in initial skills training pipelines lasting longer than 12 months. These
        individuals will be required to receive their training within 90 days of in processing
        into their first permanent duty location after the award of their AFSC. This course is a
        pre-requisite to the CBRNE Defense Survival Skills Course.
        6.6.1.2.3. A course completion certificate is provided upon successful completion of
        the course. This certificate must be printed out and given to the UDM, UTM or Unit
        Scheduler before the student can be scheduled for and attend the CBRNE Survival

        the course. Record course completion IAW paragraph 6.4.2.
        6.6.1.15.5. Additional optional training is available through the Joint Senior Leaders
        Course (JSLC). The JSLC informs leaders about CBRN defense and provides them
        with a foundation of operational and strategic knowledge while emphasizing joint CB
        defense fundamentals and doctrine. The course provides the opportunity for
        interaction and information exchange with CBRN and Homeland Security experts
        from the Services, Joint Staff, DOD, and other agencies. The course is conducted by
        the United States Army Chemical School at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.
     6.6.1.16. Explosive Ordnance Reconnaissance (EOR) Course is under the guidance of
     EOD as the OPR for this course. The Readiness and Emergency Management Flight will
     serve as the OPR on installations that do not have EOD personnel assigned. The EOR
     training video (PIN 613523) nor the EOR computer-based stand along course are viable
     training options. The EOR training material has been incorporated into the CBRNE
     Defense Awareness Course and is no longer a separate course, it will be accomplished
     IAW Table 6.3. EOD technicians should supplement the EOR portion of the CBRNE
     Defense Awareness Course by conducting traditional, theater-specific, instructor-led
     courses for EOR training in contingency environments.

      6.7.1.2. Standardized knowledge-based information is provided through an automated,
      interactive program titled "Are You Ready? – BEPO".
          6.7.1.2.1. This game-show format product is designed for use by all members and
          their dependents, including children.
          6.7.1.2.2. Initial completion and recurring use requirements for military personnel is
          determined locally.
          6.7.1.2.3. Unit commanders will ensure completion is documented using local
          procedures.
   6.7.2. Unit support of the information program consists of, but is not limited to, unit EM
   Representatives disseminating EM information provided by the CE Readiness Flight to
   assigned personnel.
      6.7.2.1. Media such as visual aids, handouts, posters, base bulletins, electronic media,
      and base newspapers should be used. HQ AFCESA will develop standard AF visual aids
      as new publications are created. Until these standard visual aids are published
      MAJCOMs or installations are authorized to create their own and use for their specific
      threat requirements.
      6.7.2.2. The CE Readiness Flight disseminates this information at least quarterly to unit
      EM Representatives.
      6.7.2.3. Using localized procedures, the CE Readiness Flight will record what
      information was distributed, who received it, and when it was provided.
6.8. Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Education and Training.
   6.8.1. Personnel listed in Table 6.2 must meet the training requirements specified in Table
   6.2. The DOD HAZMAT certification program, based on National Fire Protection
   Association (NFPA) Standards 471 and 472, consists of HAZMAT awareness, operations,
   technician, and HAZMAT IC training levels. The installation HAZMAT emergency planning
   team will ensure DOD, State, and local HAZMAT response training requirements are
   identified and met. NOTE: Security Forces and Medical responders will use the 29 CFR
   1910.120 training requirements to train their personnel to respond to CBRNE incidents and
   do not require DOD certification. CE Readiness requires successful completion of the DOD
   HAZMAT Certification Program for the levels identified in Table 6.2.
   6.8.2. The Air Force, as the employer, has implemented four methods to satisfy the
   HAZMAT training and DOD certification requirements of NFPA Standards 471 and 472.
   These four methods are:
      6.8.2.1. Reciprocity requires completing an International Fire Service Accreditation
      Congress or National Professional Qualifications Board accredited course.
      6.8.2.2. DOD Certification requires enrolling in and completing the DOD certification
      courses that are available to any DOD employee through the Air Force Institute for
      Advanced Distributed Learning. These courses include 47201, Awareness; 47202,
      Operations; 47203, Technician; and 47205, Incident Commander. This method is
      considered complete when the member passes the certification test (CerTest) final
      examination, completes the performance test evaluations, and receives DOD certification.

 AIR FORCE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) EXERCISE AND EVALUATION
                         PROGRAM

7.1. Purpose. This chapter provides Air Force EM program exercise and evaluation, objectives,
policy, and responsibilities. This chapter expands the guidance for the exercise program directed
by AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities; AFI 10-204, Readiness Exercises and After-Action
Reporting Program; and AFI 10-230, Conduct of Key Exercises and Experiments. Installation
Exercise Program Offices, EET Chiefs, and EET members use this chapter to develop and
conduct the installation’s exercise program as it relates to the Air Force EM program.
7.2. Objectives. The installation exercise program has three objectives:
   7.2.1. To provide the Installation Commander a means to plan and conduct realistic,
   integrated exercises, and training for all installation personnel.
   7.2.2. To maximize the benefits gained through exercises and provide accurate, honest
   feedback to commanders for planning, preparation, and training purposes. Specifically, the
   exercise program and evaluator training strive to enhance readiness, boost capabilities,
   streamline procedures, and improve mission readiness.
   7.2.3. To establish the minimum exercise and evaluation criteria for the following areas of
   the installation EM program:
       7.2.3.1. Base contingency plans and checklists implementation and execution
       effectiveness.
       7.2.3.2. Installation notification and warning system function and effectiveness.
       7.2.3.3. First Responder and Emergency Responder ability to detect, assess, contain, and
       recover from incidents.
       7.2.3.4. Recovery plan development and execution capability.
       7.2.3.5. Off-base interface with local responders and EOC.
       7.2.3.6. Ability to provide military assistance under imminently serious conditions.
       7.2.3.7. Ability to continue mission during and following a incident.
       7.2.3.8. Integrate periodic testing of the local weather watch or weather warning
       dissemination systems with installation EM activities and evaluate the timeliness of
       notification of personnel and response capability for onand off-base agencies and GSUs.
       Include AFI 10-229 requirements.
7.3. Exercise Policy. Exercises should focus on competency of and compliance with the
requirements listed in the CEMP 10-2, AT Plan 31-101, Disease Containment Plan (when
published), MCRP, ESP, and Installation Deployment Plan. Exercises must evaluate and
reinforce the capabilities to meet those requirements. These AF EM exercise requirements and
scenarios meet the intent of the Department of Homeland Security 15 National Planning
Scenarios. Exercise requirements are listed in Table 7.1, Air Force Emergency (EM) Program
Exercise Requirements–Installation Exercises.

 Note 1–MAJCOMs will determine types, scenarios and scope of exercises for their installations
 in their MAJCOM supplements to this instruction.
 Note 2–Installations will determine if outside exercises such as the AF All Hazards Response
 Training, Department of Homeland Security or other multi-jurisdictional agency exercises count
 as part of their exercise requirements.
 Note 3–MAJCOMs will provide specifics for their installations for exercise frequency and
 types.
 Note 4–An exercise (major accident, natural disaster, terrorist use of CBRNE or an ORE) must
 be conducted at least quarterly. Installations can combine types of exercises to limit the total
 number of exercises per year.
 Note 5–COCOM/CC can modify these requirements to meet their specific area/theater needs.
 Note 6–Types can be combined in the same exercise period and in the same scenario.
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                         93


   7.3.1. MAJCOMs, FOAs, or DRUs must provide guidelines on ground rules, evaluation
   areas, report formats, and grading criteria to subordinate units for exercises IAW AFI 10-204.
   MAJCOMs will determine exercise requirements for GSUs.
       7.3.1.1. Primary and alternate DRF personnel must each take part in at least one exercise
       per year.

       annual exercise participation of their respective personnel.
       7.3.1.2. Recall and personnel accountability will be an exercise objective in each EM
       incident. The installation may choose to perform a limited recall, such as recalling only
       the EOC, rather than recalling the entire installation.
7.4. Exercise Concepts.
   7.4.1. Embody the "train the way we fight" concept.
   7.4.2. Apply real-world command and local community relationships when possible.
   7.4.3. Keep simulations to a minimum, emphasize participation, and reduce artificialities to
   assess actual abilities consistent with safety, exercise objectives, security, mission
   accomplishment, and other real-world constraints.
   7.4.4. Integrate logistics, support, force protection, and operational security requirements
   with mission requirements.
   7.4.5. Develop exercise scenarios to validate actual plans, policies, procedures, processes,
   and doctrine using existing command, control and communications systems.
   7.4.6. Plan, prepare, and exercise with local communities in local emergency or disaster
   recovery actions to support AFPD 10-8.
   7.4.7. Real-world incidents may be substituted for exercise requirements if the incident
   requires the activation of the DRF and after-action lessons learned reports are written and
   distributed.
   7.4.8. MAJCOM staffs will provide functional guidance and checklists, as required for
   readiness and compliance items subject to inspection, and ensure deficiencies identified
   during inspections are corrected IAW AFI 90-201.

               CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT AND REPORT PROCEDURES

8.1. Purpose. This chapter establishes guidance for assessing and reporting Air Force EM
capabilities on a routine, pre-incident basis and reporting of actual response when incidents
occur. Reporting is mandated by AFI 10-201, AFI 10-204, and AFI 10-206. Some units use the
AEF Reporting Tool (ART), following guidance in AFI 10-244, Reporting Status of Aerospace
Expeditionary Forces, to report Unit Type Code (UTC) status reporting and AEF certification.
8.2. Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Capability Reports. The Installation
Commander uses monthly SORTS reports and annual Radiological Response Capability Reports
to report the installation’s overall capability to respond to the installation deployment mission or
support a radiological response. The commander must assess installation resources, augmenting
resources, and critical capabilities available through MAAs or commercial sources. The
combination of these resources should assist the installation in more closely achieving maximum
response capability.
   8.2.1. SORTS Reporting. Commanders at all levels must use measurement tools for
   assessing the strength and effectiveness of their EM program. Although SORTS reports are
   not EM-specific, the data needed to complete the SORTS reports make SORTS reporting a
   tool that can be used to support the Air Force EM program. SORTS reporting is based on
   continuous monitoring of changes in the overall unit level, resource category levels, and unit
   locations. Units must report no later than every 30 days or when changes affect the unit’s
   overall rating. To obtain the resources necessary for successful mission accomplishment,
   personnel at every level must report the program status with specific justifications. AFI 10-
   201 provides the requirements for reporting this information and further details.
   8.2.2. Radiological Response Capability Report.
       8.2.2.1. Installations will use Defense Special Weapons Agency (DSWA) 5100.52.1-L,
       Nuclear Accident Response Capability Listing, as the reference document to submit the
       annual report (DD Form 2325, Radiological Response Capability Report), with
       information current as of 1 September of the current year. The annual report should arrive
       at the MAJCOM no later than 10 September of the current year. Do not classify the
       report. Submit interim reports when a capability is substantially changed, such as an
       addition, deletion, or transfer of capability. Minor changes in quantities may be deferred
       until the annual update.
       8.2.2.2. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs will submit annual reports not later than 1
       October of the current year to the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. To submit, send
       DD Forms 2325 directly to: Director, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, ATTN:
       Operations Center, 8725 John J. Kingman Rd Stop 6201, Ft. Belvoir VA 22060, or e-
       mail electronic copies to OPSCNTR1@DTRA.MIL, or facsimile (front and back of
       forms) to DSN 427-2094, commercial (703) 767-2094. A letter of transmittal or
       endorsement is not required. Additional information can be obtained by calling DSN 427-
       2003, commercial (703) 767-2003.
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                          97


8.3. Reports. The Installation Commander uses OPREP-3 and Situation Report (SITREP)
reports to report the installation’s overall EM response to incidents such as terrorist use of
CBRNE and DSCA support. See AFI 10-206 for the required reporting procedures.
   8.3.1. Event/Incident Report (OPREP-3). OPREP-3 reports use command post channels to
   immediately notify commanders of any event or incident that may attract international,
   national, US Air Force, or significant news media interest. Submit the OPREP-3 regardless
   of whether or not the event is being reported through other channels. AFI 10-206 details eight
   categories of OPREP-3 reports to help users determine the type of report to submit. CBRNE
   incidents, including HAZMAT releases, are reported using OPREP-3 reports.
   8.3.2. Commander's SITREP. SITREP reports keep the Joint Staff, Services, and SecDef
   apprised of existing political, military, and operational situations and plans. SITREPS also
   advise commanders of a units ability to meet requirements outlined in approved plans. DSCA
   is reported through SITREP reports whether or not the support was covered by an MAA.
8.4. After-Action Reports. Procedures for after-actions reports are provided in AFI 10-204.
Commanders must send an installation-wide lessons-learned report to their MAJCOM, FOA, or
DRU for all emergency responses. After-action reports should include actions implemented and
any lessons learned during actual incident response and exercises.
   8.4.1. Reports must be submitted within 14 days after the incident. The report must include
   dissemination and notification successes and shortfalls, installation-wide response checklists,
   deficiencies, deficiency correction plans, required training, dates of implementation, or
   corrective action, follow-up actions, and lessons learned. See AFI 10-204 for guidance on
   reportable actions, as well as preparing, and submitting the report.
   8.4.2. After-action reports are also required by the Air Force After-Actions Reporting
   System (AFAARS) when Air Force elements participate in the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
   of Staff Exercise Program, other joint exercises, Air Force exercises, and real-world
   operations. AFAARS reporting is required on humanitarian, base closure, peacekeeping, and
   Noncombatant Evacuation Operations (NEO). Air Force, MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs
   must establish internal after-action reporting procedures that ensure AFAARS objectives are
   met, problems are solved and results are disseminated.

AIR FORCE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (EM) PROGRAM NOTIFICATION AND
                      WARNING SYSTEMS

9.1. Purpose. This chapter establishes policies for standardized signals and requirements for
installation notification and warning signals.
9.2. General Information. Every Air Force installation must have a rapid and effective system
to disseminate emergency information quickly. This includes signals or messaging appropriate to
FPCONs, watches, warnings, evacuation routes, and other alerting information to meet DOD and
Federal warning requirements. The installation should incorporate all available resources to
provide warning, which may include cable override, reverse 911, or Network Broadcast System.
The incorporated resources compose the Air Force Installation Notification and Warning System
(INWS), as detailed in paragraph 9.3.
   9.2.1. Air Force Visual Aid (AFVA) 10-2510, USAF Emergency Notification Signals, and
   AFVA10-2511, USAF Standardized Attack Warning Signals for the United States, Its
   Territories and Possessions, provide standardized signals that must be used. These signals
   can be supplemented with signals compatible with local, national, host nation, or theater
   systems. Follow command and theater guidance when more than one system applies. Signals
   used within the United States, its territories, and possessions are compatible with those
   established by FEMA and the Homeland Security Advisory System.
   9.2.2. Display local visual aids or posters in work and rest areas. To incorporate local
   information, the overprint of AFVAs 10-2510 and 10-2511 is authorized.
   9.2.3. Deployable units should consult plans for specific signals used at the deployed
   locations they support. For deployments to bare base locations, the communications unit
   must provide notification and warning systems.
   9.2.4. Consider unique populations, such as the visually or hearing impaired, to ensure
   effective warning systems are in place to provide for their safety. Planners also consider the
   environment in which the system operates and ensure that all personnel can immediately hear
   or see status changes and take action. For example, voice warnings must be audible to
   personnel inside facilities and over background noise such as air conditioning units. Use
   visual warnings when audio signals interfere with operational security.
   9.2.5. Use DOD-required individual building Mass Notification Systems (MNS) to
   disseminate EM information. MNS will be installed in most new and renovated buildings to
   meet DOD AT requirements. Comply with DOD Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-010-01,
   DOD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings and UFC 4-021-01, Design and
   O&M: Mass Notification Systems.
9.3. Installation Notification and Warning System (INWS). The INWS is a combination of
methods using audible and visual signals, verbal messages, and electronic communication.
Communication modes include sirens, horns, radio tone alerting, MNS, unaided voice systems,
public and broadcast address systems, local area network messaging, telephone alert
conferencing, pagers, television, radio, flags, signs, and other electronic or mechanical methods.
See UFC 4-021-01 for details about warning standards.

9.3. (AEDC)The Operating Contractor’s Operations Center prepares and transmits all
reports to higher headquarters and is delegated authority to activate the weather tones of the
Giant Voice System. The Operations Center develops checklists for ring-down notifications,
―AtHoc‖ notifications, computer pop-up messages, and checklists to notify the base populace of
weather warnings from trusted weather sources. The Installation Notification and Warning
System (INWS) may be used for public announcements only when specifically authorized by the
AEDC Commander.
   9.3.1. CE and Communications Squadrons will design warning systems for operation
   throughout disaster conditions. The system must be redundant, hardened, or splinter-
   protected, and operate using both commercial and emergency power. Incorporate existing
   networks into this system.
   9.3.2. The INWS must:
       9.3.2.1. Provide installation-wide coverage of outdoor areas, indoor facilities, housing,
       and separated sites.
       9.3.2.2. Reach off-base facilities that are controlled or owned by the installation to
       ensure coverage for personnel working or billeted in those areas.
       9.3.2.3. Incorporate DOD-required MNS into the indoor coverage.
          9.3.2.3.1. Design outdoor INWS voice signals to be intelligible to personnel.
          9.3.2.3.2. Consider the use of directional-type loudspeakers to minimize the
          distortion caused by overlapping voice signals.
       9.3.2.4. Incorporate systematic and coordinated standard to support the AFIMS,
       including protocols for:
          9.3.2.4.1. Initial and follow-on emergency responder and senior leader incident
          notification.
          9.3.2.4.2. Coordinated action for single or multiple incidents.
          9.3.2.4.3. Initiation of pre-planned and incident-specific actions by units, teams and
          individuals, and off-base responders.
          9.3.2.4.4. Alert, notification, and warning of 100 percent of units and personnel and
          units under installation responsibility.
          9.3.2.4.5. Operating under differing FPCONs and Alarm Conditions.
          9.3.2.4.6. Integration of crisis and consequence management functions.
       9.3.2.5. Provide mechanisms for vertical and horizontal coordination, communications,
       and information sharing in response to threats or incidents.
   9.3.3. Domestic locations must use installation notification and warning systems that comply
   with DHS, FEMA, and National Weather Service’s Emergency Managers Weather
   Information Network and the Emergency Alerting System alerting methods, requirements,
   and capabilities. Off-base systems are the responsibility of the city or county EM office.
   9.3.4. Foreign locations must use warning systems and signals that are compatible with
   local, host nation, or theater systems. Follow COCOM or DOS guidance when more than one
 100                                         AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011


   notification and warning system may be applied or is in operation. Alert, notification, and
   warning methods must provide both overt and covert notification capability. Warning
   systems in foreign countries should broadcast voice messages in English and the predominant
   language of the local personnel working on base.
9.4. Installation Notification and Warning System (INWS) Responsibilities.
   9.4.1. Installation Commander through the ICC. The Communications Squadron ensures
   installation, testing, activation, and maintenance are accomplished to ensure the installation
   populace can be warned of impending or occurring events. The ICC is responsible to activate
   and the CE Operations Flight is responsible for testing and maintaining individual building
   MNS when designated as real property installed equipment (RPIE). The owner or user must
   test, maintain, and activate systems that are not designated RPIE.
   9.4.2. The Installation Commander, incident commander, or other designated individual
   directs use of the system to ensure personnel safety.
   9.4.3. Command post personnel will test the INWS daily and weekly. They will also ensure
   a procedure is in place to verify each INWS location is operational. The command post will
   maintain a record of the test results. The methodology to verify the INWS can be heard at all
   locations outdoors on base must be coordinated between the command post, Communications
   Squadron, and the CE Squadron. This must be a locally developed procedure due to the
   differences in INWS systems and base topography.
   9.4.4. The Communications Squadron is responsible for coordinating new INWS
   requirements and tracking maintenance requirements on existing INWS components. The
   command post is responsible for identifying, reporting, and tracking INWS outages. The CE
   Operations Flight is responsible for maintaining existing power requirements. The
   Communications Squadron installs and maintains the INWS components that activate,
   generate, and transmit the INWS signal including speakers, sirens, and amplifiers. The CE
   Operations Flight installs and maintains individual building MNS when designated as RPIE.

Air Force Career Field Managers (AFCFM)—Enlisted AFCFMs are typically CMSgts
serving at Headquarters Air Force who are responsible for organizing and managing one or more
enlisted career fields. Their responsibilities include establishing career field entry requirements,
managing trained personnel requirements and manning, as well as developing and managing
career-long training plans' requirements and programs.
Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program—The single, integrated Air Force
program to coordinate and organize efforts to prepare for, prevent, respond to, recover from, and
mitigate the direct and indirect consequences of an emergency or attack. The primary missions
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                              115


of the Air Force EM program are to (1) save lives, (2) minimize the loss or degradation of
resources, and (3) continue, sustain, and restore combat and combat support operational
capability in an all-hazards physical threat environment at Air Force installations worldwide. The
ancillary missions of the Air Force EM program are to support homeland defense and civil
support operations and to provide support to civil and host nation authorities IAW DOD
directives and through the appropriate Combatant Command. The Air Force EM program is
managed by the Office of The Civil Engineer, AF/A7C.
Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS)—A methodology designed to incorporate
the requirements of HSPD-5, the NIMS, the NRP, and OSD guidance while preserving the
unique military requirements of the expeditionary Air Force. AFIMS provides the Air Force
with an incident management system that is consistent with the single, comprehensive approach
to domestic incident management. AFIMS provides the Air Force with the coordinating
structures, processes, and protocols required to integrate its specific authorities into the collective
framework of Federal departments and agencies for action to include mitigation, prevention,
preparedness, response, and recovery activities. It includes a core set of concepts, principles,
terminology, and technologies covering the incident command system, EOCs, incident
command, training, identification and management of resources, qualification and certification,
and the collection, tracking and reporting of incident information and incident resources. The
AFIMS methodology is incorporated into current operating practices through revised instructions
and manuals, training products, and exercise and evaluation tools.
Antiterrorism (AT)—Defensive measures used to reduce the vulnerability of individuals and
property to terrorist acts, to include limited response and containment by local military and
civilian forces. See also AFI 10-245.
Area of Responsibility (AOR)—The geographical area associated with a COCOM within
which a combatant commander has authority to plan and conduct operations.
Avoidance—Individual and/or unit measures taken by individuals or units to avoid or minimize
CBRN attacks and reduce the effects of CBRN hazards.
Awareness—The continual process of collecting, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence,
information, and knowledge to allow organizations and individuals to anticipate requirements
and to react effectively.
Bare Base—A base having minimum essential facilities to house, sustain, and support
operations to include, if required, a stabilized runway, taxiways, and aircraft parking areas. A
bare base must have a source of water that can be made potable. Other requirements to operate
under bare base conditions form a necessary part of the force package deployed to the bare base.
Biological Agent—A microorganism that causes disease in personnel, plants, or animals or
causes the deterioration of material.
Biological Threat—A threat that consists of biological material planned to be deployed to
produce casualties in personnel or animals or damage plants.

CBRN—Operations that include chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear, either
individually or in combination. Collectively known as WMD, CBRN replaces ― ―NBC‖ when
used in reference to operations or incidents limited to NBC-only issues. TIC/TIM and
HAZMAT are considered part of the ― ―C‖ in ―‖CBRN‖.
CBRNE—Operations or incidents involving chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and
high-yield explosives, either individually or in combination. ― ―CBRNE‖ is used anytime that
reference is not being made to WMD operations or incidents.
CBRNE Environment—Condition of warfare in which an adversary possesses or uses
chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or high-yield explosive weapons, by-products,
infrastructure, and associated delivery methods.
CBRNE Hazard—Those CBRNE elements that pose or could pose a hazard to individuals.
CBRNE hazards include those created from accidental realizes, TIM (especially air and water
poisons), biological pathogens, radioactive matter, and high-yield explosives. Also included are
any hazards resulting from the deliberate employment of WMD during military operations.
CBRNE High Threat Area (HTA)—Friendly forces in these areas are at high risk for attack
with CBRNE weapons by states and non-state actors, such as terrorists and criminals also known
as transnationals. Potential adversaries within the region either possess or are likely to possess a
substantial stockpile of CBRNE weapons and weapons systems and may have special operations
forces capable of conducting sustained attacks on airbases. Actual or potential transnational
threats exist during peacetime or wartime. Forces are within immediate strike range of adversary
theater missiles, and CBRNE strikes using these weapons are assumed to be likely to occur. Air
Force personnel and units in or deployed to these locations will be organized, trained, exercised,
and equipped to survive CBRNE attacks and conduct sustained combat operations in CBRNE
environments.
CBRNE Low Threat Area (LTA)—Friendly forces in these areas are at risk for attack with
CBRNE weapons by transnationals. Actual or potential transnational threats exist during
peacetime or wartime. Select personnel (see paragraphs 2.4.2.6 and 2.4.2.7) and other
personnel identified in CEMP 10-2 are organized, trained, and equipped to continue critical
missions and restore the primary mission. All other personnel in these locations are trained to
survive attacks.
CBRNE Medium Threat Area (MTA)—Friendly forces in these areas are at medium risk for
attack with CBRNE weapons by states and non-state actors, such as terrorists and criminals also
known as transnationals. Potential adversaries within the region either possess or are likely to
possess CBRNE weapons and weapons systems and may also have special operations forces
capable of conducting limited attacks on airbases. Actual or potential transnational threats exist
during peacetime or wartime. Forces may be within the extended range of adversary theater
missiles, but it is assessed that CBRNE strikes using these weapons are less likely to occur. Air
Force personnel and units in or deployed to these locations will be organized, trained, exercised,
and equipped to survive CBRNE attacks and to conduct limited combat operations in CBRNE
environments.
Chemical Agent—Any toxic chemical intended for use in military operations.
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                           117

significant period of time, personnel or animals, and deny or hinder the use of areas, facilities or
material; or defense against employment of chemical agents.
Chemical Warfare (CW)—All aspects of military operations involving the employment of
lethal and incapacitating munitions or agents and the warning and protective measures associated
with such offensive operations. Because riot control agents and herbicides are not considered
chemical warfare agents, those two items will be referred to separately or under the broader term
― ―chemical‖, that will be used to include all types of chemical munitions or agents collectively.
Chemical Weapon (CW)—Together or separately, (a) a toxic chemical and its precursors,
except when intended for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention; (b)
a munition or device specifically designed to cause death or other harm through toxic properties

biological, radiological, or toxic or poisonous chemical materials, or the detonation of a high-
yield explosive.
Civil Disturbance—Group acts of violence and disorder prejudicial to public law and order.
Cold Zone—This area contains the command post and such other support functions as are
deemed necessary to control the incident. The zone encompassing the warm zone used to carry
out all other support functions of the incident. Workers in the cold zone are not required to wear
personal protective clothing because the zone is considered safe. The MEOC, the IC staging
area, and the triage or treatment area are located within the cold zone.
Combating Terrorism—Actions, including AT (defensive measures taken to reduce
vulnerability to terrorist acts) and counterterrorism (offensive measures taken to prevent, deter,
and respond to terrorism), taken to oppose terrorism throughout the entire threat spectrum.
Command and Control (C2)—The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated
commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. C2
functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communications,
facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and
controlling forces and operations in the accomplishment of the mission.
Command Post (CP)—A unit or sub-unit’s headquarters where the commander and the staff
perform their activities. In combat, a unit or sub-unit’s headquarters is often divided into
echelons.
Commander’s Senior Staff—A C2 function normally activated for a specific incident to
oversee the mission operation of the installation. The Commander’s Senior Staff is scalable to
support the ICC and coordinate with the EOC. (NOTE: Do not abbreviate as ――CSS‖.)
 118                                          AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011

by more than one command. A COP facilitates collaborative planning and assists all echelons to
achieve situational awareness.
Confirmatory Identification—The determination of a CBRNE material or pathogen’s identity
to the specificity and confidence required to meet all objectives of the incident recovery.
Consequence Management (CM)—Actions taken to maintain or restore essential services and
manage and mitigate problems resulting from disasters and catastrophes, including natural,
manmade, or terrorist incidents.
Contamination—1. The deposit, absorption, or adsorption of radioactive material or of
biological or chemical agents on or by structures, areas, personnel, or objects, or in aerosolized
clouds. 2. (DOD only) Food or water made unfit for consumption by humans or animals
because of the presence of environmental chemicals, radioactive elements, bacteria, or
organisms, the by-product of the growth of bacteria or organisms, the decomposing material (to
include the food substance itself) or waste in the food or water.
Contamination Control Area—An area in which contaminated IPE is removed; people,
equipment, and supplies are decontaminated to allow processing between a toxic environment
and a toxic free area; the last area an individual can safely don IPE before moving into a
contaminated area.
Contamination Control Station—An area specifically designated for allowing ingress and
egress of personnel and equipment to or from the hazards area. The outer boundary of the CCS
is the CCL, and the inner boundary is the line segment labeled the hot line.
Contingency—An emergency involving military forces caused by natural disasters, terrorists,
subversives, or by required military operations. Due to the uncertainty of the situation,
contingencies require plans, rapid response and special procedures to ensure the safety and
readiness of personnel, installations, and equipment.
Contingency Operations Costs—These are the incremental costs that would not be incurred if
the contingency operation were not being carried out.
Continuity of Operations (COOP)—The degree or state of being continuous in the conduct of
functions, tasks, or duties necessary to accomplish a military action or mission in carrying out
the national military strategy. It includes the functions and duties of the commander as well as
the supporting functions and duties performed by the staff and others acting under the authority
and direction of the commander.
Control Zones—The areas at a HAZMAT incident that are designated based upon safety and the
degree of hazard.
Conventional Explosive Attack—Conventional explosives are compounds or mixtures (such as
ammonium nitrate, TNT, or plastic explosives) that create blast and cause fragmentation when
detonated. Military munitions and IEDs use conventional explosives. The vast majority of
attacks involving conventional explosives are simply conventional explosive attacks. ―High-
Yield ―Explosive‖ (HYE), is a term used to further delineate conventional explosives and is
defined by DOD as: any conventional [explosive] weapon or device that is capable of a high
order of destruction or disruption and/or of being used in such a manner as to kill or injure large
numbers of people. (HYE is the E in CBRNE.). "Note that HYE is similar to the term
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                            119


――WMD‖– it refers to a weapon or device, and the method in which it is used so that it kills a
large number of people. The key for HYE is how the device is constructed and employed. For
purposes of planning protective measures, the CJCS (CJCSI 3435.01) further clarified HYE as a
device or incident involving: (1) the use of a conventional explosive weapon in conjunction with
a CBRN component or (2) the terrorist use of a conventional weapon or explosive device in such
a manner to inflict a large number of casualties. Examples include a vehicle-borne IED parked
adjacent to a hospital, or an explosive device placed strategically on an aircraft. The term
"explosive" or "conventional explosive" includes the term "HYE" unless specifically noted.
Conventional Weapon—A weapon that is not chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear.
Cordon—A physical barrier surrounding the incident scene where controls are established to
preclude unauthorized entry.
Critical Infrastructures—Systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United

decontamination procedures take place. (Also known as the contamination reduction corridor.)
(NFPA Standard 471).
Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA)—Refers to DOD support, including Federal
military forces, DOD civilians and DOD contractor personnel, and DOD agencies and
components, for domestic emergencies and for designated law enforcement and other activities.
Deployment—1. In naval usage, the change from a cruising approach or contact disposition to a
disposition for battle. 2. The movement of forces within operational areas. 3. The positioning
of forces into a formation for battle. 4. The relocation of forces and material to desired
operational areas. Deployment encompasses all activities from origin or home station through
destination, specifically including intra-continental United States, inter-theater, and intra-theater
movement legs, staging, and holding areas.
Detection—In CBRNE environments, the act of locating CBRNE hazards by use of CBRNE
detectors or monitoring or survey teams.
Disaster Response Force (DRF)—The Air Force structure that responds to disasters or
accidents, establishing C2 and supporting disaster operations.
Dispersal—Relocation of forces for the purpose of increasing survivability.

States, District of Columbia, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, US possessions, and territories or
any political subdivision thereof, as a result of enemy attack, insurrection, civil disturbance,
 120                                          AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011


earthquake, fire, flood, or other public disasters or equivalent emergencies that endanger life and
property or disrupt the usual process of government. The term domestic emergency includes any
or all of the emergency conditions defined below:
       a. Civil defense emergency. A domestic emergency disaster situation resulting
       from devastation created by an enemy attack and requiring emergency operations
       during and following that attack. It may be proclaimed by appropriate authority in
       anticipation of an attack.
       b. Civil disturbances. Riots, acts of violence, insurrections, unlawful obstructions
       or assemblages, or other disorders prejudicial to public law and order. The term
       civil disturbance includes all domestic conditions requiring or likely to require
       the use of Federal Armed Forces pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 15 of Title
       10, USC.
       c. Major disaster. Any flood, fire, hurricane, tornado, earthquake, or other
       catastrophe which, in the determination of the President, is or threatens to be of
       sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant disaster assistance by the Federal
       Government under Public Law 606, 91st Congress (42 USC 58) to supplement
       the efforts and available resources of State and local governments in alleviating
       the damage, hardship, or suffering caused thereby.
       d. Natural disaster. All domestic emergencies except those created as a result of
       enemy attack or civil disturbance.
Emergency Decontamination—The physical process of immediately reducing contamination of
individuals in potentially life-threatening situations with or without the formal establishment of a
decontamination corridor. (NFPA 471) NOTE: The EPA does not require runoff control when a
process is used to save lives or reduce injury.
Emergency Operations Center (EOC)—For the purposes of AFIMS, the EOC is the C2
support elements that directs, monitors, and supports the installation’s actions before, during, and
after an incident. The EOC is activated and recalled as necessary by the Installation
Commander. The EOC updates the ICC with ongoing incident status and seeks support through
the ICC when on-scene requirements surpass the installation’s inherent capability and the
installation’s cumulative capabilities acquired through MAAs. EOCs may also support MCS and
joint information activities. According to the NRP, the EOC is defined as ――The physical
location at which the coordination of information and resources to support attack response and
incident management activities normally takes place. An EOC may be a temporary facility or
may be located in a more central or permanently established facility, perhaps at a higher level of
organization within a jurisdiction. EOCs may be organized by major functional disciplines such
as fire, law enforcement, and medical services, by jurisdiction such as Federal, State, regional,
county, city, tribal, or by some combination there of‖.
*Emergency Responders—The response element of a DRF that deploy to the accident scene
after the First Responders to expand C2 and perform support functions. Emergency Responders
include follow-on elements such as firefighters, law enforcement personnel, security personnel,
and emergency medical technicians, as well as emergency management personnel, EOD
personnel, physicians, nurses, medical treatment providers at medical treatment facilities, public
health officers, bioenvironmental engineering personnel, and mortuary affairs personnel.
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                          121


Emergency Responders also include specialized teams such as the RST or SMT. Not all
Emergency Responders are First Responders, but all First Responders are Emergency
Responders. Emergency Responders are not assigned to additional duties that will conflict with
their emergency duties. For the purposes of AFIMS, EOD personnel are considered Emergency
Responders but not First Responders.
Emergency Support Function (ESF)—ESFs are groupings of capabilities into an
organizational structure that provides the support, resources, program implementation, and
services that are most likely to be needed during an incident. ESFs also serve as the primary
operational-level mechanism that provides support during an incident.
Evacuation—1. The process of moving any person who is wounded, injured, or ill to and/or
between medical treatment facilities. 2. The clearance of personnel, animals, or materiel from a
given locality. 3. The controlled process of collecting, classifying, and shipping unserviceable
or abandoned materiel, US or foreign, to appropriate reclamation, maintenance, technical
intelligence, or disposal facilities. 4. The ordered or authorized departure of noncombatants
from a specific area by Department of State, DOD, or appropriate military commander. This
refers to the movement from one area to another in the same or different countries. The
evacuation is caused by unusual or emergency circumstances and applies equally to command or
non-command sponsored family members.
Expeditionary Operation—An expeditionary operation is a military operation conducted by an
armed force to accomplish a specific objective in a foreign country. The missions of military
expeditions may vary widely. Examples of missions of military expeditions include providing
humanitarian assistance in times of disaster or disruption; establishing and keeping peace in a
foreign country; protecting US citizens or commerce abroad; retaliating for an act of aggression
by a foreign political group; and destroying an enemy government by defeating its armed forces
in combat.
Expeditionary Units—These designated units are formed to conduct a specific mission of
limited duration in support of a combatant commander requirement. Because a standing wing,
group, or squadron does not normally deploy intact, UTCs from multiple units are deployed to
create an expeditionary unit.
Explosive Ordnance—All munitions containing explosives, nuclear fission or fusion materials,
and biological and chemical agents. This includes bombs and warheads; guided and ballistic
missiles; artillery, mortar, rocket, and small arms ammunition; all mines, torpedoes and depth
charges; demolition charges; pyrotechnics; clusters and dispensers; cartridge and propellant
actuated devices; electro-explosive devices; clandestine and IEDs; and all similar or related items
or components explosive in nature.
Facility—A real property entity consisting of one or more of the following: a building, a
structure, a utility system, pavement, and underlying land.
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)—The Federal agency tasked to establish
Federal policies for and coordinate civil defense and civil emergency planning, management,
mitigation, and assistance functions of Executive agencies.
First Receivers—Healthcare workers at a medical facility that may receive contaminated
victims for treatment.
 122                                           AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011


First Responders—The DRF elements that deploys immediately to the disaster scene to provide
initial C2, to save lives, and to suppress and control hazards. Firefighters, law enforcement
security personnel and key medical personnel provide the initial, immediate response to a
CBRNE incident. All First Responders are Emergency Responders, but not all Emergency
Responders are First Responders. First Responders are not assigned as augmentees or to
additional duties that will conflict with their emergency duties.
Force Protection (FP)—Actions taken to prevent or mitigate hostile actions against Department
of Defense personnel (to include family members), resources, facilities, and critical information.
These actions conserve the force’s fighting potential so it can be applied at the decisive time and
place and incorporate the coordinated and synchronized offensive and defensive measures to
enable the effective employment of the joint force while degrading opportunities for the enemy.
Force protection does not include actions to defeat the enemy or protect against accidents,
weather, or disease. Also called FP. (JP 1-02) [An integrated application of offensive and
defensive actions that deter, detect, pre-empt, mitigate, or negate threats against or hazards to Air
Force air and space operations and assets, based on an acceptable level of risk.] (Definition in
brackets applies only to the Air Force and is offered for clarity.). See also AFI 10-245.
Functional Area Analysis (FAA)—The FAA identifies the operational tasks, conditions, and
standards needed to achieve military objectives. It uses the national strategies, the Family of
Joint Future Concepts, UCP-assigned missions, CONOPS, joint tasks, the capabilities list (e.g.,
Universal Joint Task List), the anticipated range of broad capabilities that an adversary might
employ and other sources as input. The FAA identifies the scenarios against which the
capabilities and attributes will be assessed. Scenario sources include, but are not limited to, the
Defense Planning Scenarios (DPS) published by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).
The FAA produces a prioritized list of capabilities and tasks across all functional areas necessary
to achieve the military objectives. The capabilities and their attributes should be traceable to the
Family of Joint Future Concepts and any other supporting information used to develop the
capabilities. These capabilities form the basis for integrated architectures and will be reviewed
in the follow-on functional needs analysis (FNA).
Functional Needs Analysis (FNA)—The FNA assesses the ability of the current and
programmed warfighting systems to deliver the capabilities the FAA identified under the full
range of operating conditions and to the designated measures of effectiveness. Using the
capabilities and tasks identified in the FAA as primary input, the FNA produces a list of
capability gaps that require solutions and indicates the time frame in which those solutions are
needed. It may also identify redundancies in capabilities that reflect inefficiencies. The FNA
will also provide the relative priority of the gaps identified. The FNA serves to further define
and refine the integrated architectures. The FNA must assess the entire range of doctrine,
organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities and policy, as
an inherent part of defining capability needs.
Gross Decontamination—(Also known as Hasty or Expedient decontamination.) The start of
the decontamination process during which the amount of surface contaminants is significantly
reduced. NOTE: This process typically includes as a minimum completely flushing with water
and the removal of most or all of a person’s clothing while continuing to flush. When warranted,
decontamination soap or other products may be provided. The EPA does not require runoff
control when this decontamination process is used to save lives or reduce injury.
AFI10-2501_AEDCSUP_I 10 FEBRUARY 2011                                                            123


Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT)—Any material that is flammable, corrosive, an oxidizing
agent, explosive, toxic, poisonous, etiological, radioactive, nuclear, unduly magnetic, a chemical
agent, biological research material, compressed gases, or any other material that, because of its
quantity, properties, or packaging, may endanger life or property.

Homeland Defense—The protection of United States sovereignty, territory, domestic
population, and critical infrastructure against external threats and aggression or other threats as
directed by the President. The Department of Defense is responsible for homeland defense.
Homeland defense includes missions such as domestic air defense. The Department recognizes
that threats planned or inspired by ― ―external‖ actors may materialize internally. The
reference to ― ―external threats‖ does not limit where or how attacks could be planned and
executed. The Department is prepared to conduct homeland defense missions whenever the
President, exercising his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief, authorizes military
actions.
Homeland Security Presidential Directive-5 (HSPD-5)—A Presidential directive issued on
February 28, 2003 and intended to enhance the ability of the United States to manage domestic
incidents by establishing a single, comprehensive National Incident Management System
(NIMS).
Homeland Security—Homeland security, as defined in the National Strategy for Homeland
Security, is a concerted national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States,
reduce America’s vulnerability to terrorism, and minimize the damage and recover from attacks
that do occur. The Department of Defense contributes to homeland security through its military
missions overseas, homeland defense, and support to civil authorities.
Host Nation (HN)—A nation that receives the forces or supplies of allied nations, coalition
partners, or NATO organizations to be located on, to operate in, or to transit through its territory.
Hot Zone—The area immediately surrounding a HAZMAT incident, extending far enough to
prevent adverse effects from HAZMAT releases to personnel outside the zone.
Identification—In CBRNE operations, the determination of which CBRNE material or
pathogen is present.
Incident Commander (IC)—The command function is directed by the IC, who is the person in
charge at the incident and who must be fully qualified to manage the response. Major
responsibilities for the IC include: performing command activities, such as establishing
command; protecting life and property; controlling personnel and equipment resources;
maintaining accountability for responder and public safety, as well as for task accomplishment;
and establishing and maintaining an effective liaison with outside agencies and organizations,
including the EOC when it is activated.
Incident Command System (ICS)—ICS is the model tool for command, control, and
coordination of a response and provides a means to coordinate the efforts of individual agencies

as they work toward the common goal of stabilizing the incident and protecting life, property,
and the environment. ICS uses principles that have been proven to improve efficiency and
effectiveness in a business setting and applies the principles to emergency response.
Incident—An occurrence or event, natural or human caused, that requires an emergency
response to protect life or property. Incidents can, for example, include major disasters,
emergencies, terrorist attacks, terrorist threats, wildland and urban fires, floods, HAZMAT spills,
nuclear accidents, aircraft accidents, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical storms, war-
related disasters, public health and medical emergencies, and other occurrences requiring an
emergency response.
Incidents of National Significance—An actual or potential high-impact event that requires a
coordinated and effective response by an appropriate combination of Federal, State, local, tribal,
nongovernmental, or private-sector entities to save lives and minimize damage and provide the
basis for long-term community recovery and mitigation activities.
Individual Protection—Actions taken by individuals to survive and continue the mission under
nuclear, biological, and chemical conditions.

personal clothing and equipment required to protect an individual from biological and chemical
hazards and some nuclear effects.
Initial Actions—The actions taken by those responders who are first to arrive at an incident site.
Initial Detection—Procedures performed by emergency responders to determine the presence of
HAZMAT. Initial detection is a field test using detection equipment to provide a reasonable
basis for acceptance of the presence of hazards.
Initial Isolation Zone—This defines an area surrounding the incident in which persons may be
exposed to dangerous upwind and life-threatening downwind concentrations of material.
Initial Response—Resources initially committed to an incident.
In-place Patient Decontamination (IPPD)—The capability at a medical treatment facility to
decontaminate patients arriving at the facility with potential contamination from a CBRN
incident.

commission for each emergency planning district to plan and coordinate local emergency
response actions.
Low Threat Area (LTA)—See CBRNE Low Threat Area.
Major Accident—An accident involving DOD materiel or DOD activities that is serious enough
to warrant response by the installation DRF. It differs from the minor day-to-day emergencies
and incidents that installation agencies typically handle.
Major Disaster—As defined by the Stafford Act, any natural catastrophe (including any
hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake,
volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought) or, regardless of cause, any fire,
flood or explosion, in any part of the United States, which in the determination of the President
causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance under
this act to supplement the efforts and available resources of States, local governments, and
disaster relief organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused
thereby.
Mass Decontamination—(or, Mass Casualty Decontamination) The physical process of rapidly
reducing or removing contaminants from multiple persons (victims and responders) in
potentially life-threatening situations with or without the formal establishment of a
decontamination corridor. NOTE: The EPA does not require runoff control when this process is
used to save lives or reduce injury.
Medium Threat Area (MTA)—See CBRNE Medium Threat Area.
Mission-Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP)—A flexible system of protection against
nuclear, biological, and chemical contamination. This posture requires personnel to wear only
that protective clothing and MOPP equipment appropriate to the threat level, work rate imposed
by the mission, temperature, and humidity.
Mitigation—Activities designed to reduce or eliminate risks to persons or property or to lessen
the actual or potential effects or consequences of an incident. Mitigation measures may be
implemented prior to, during, or after an incident. Mitigation measures are often developed IAW
lessons learned from prior incidents. Mitigation involves ongoing actions to reduce exposure to,
probability of, or potential loss from hazards. Measures may include zoning and building codes,
flood plain buyouts, and analysis of hazard-related data to determine where it is safe to build or
locate temporary facilities. Mitigation can include efforts to educate governments, businesses,
and the public on measures they can take to reduce loss and injury.
Monitoring—The process of sampling over time to identify changes in conditions.
Mutual Aid Agreement (MAA)—Written agreement between agencies, organizations, or
jurisdictions that they will assist one another on request by furnishing personnel, equipment, or
expertise in a specified manner. Reciprocal assistance by local government and an installation
for emergency services under a prearranged plan. Mutual aid is synonymous with ― ―mutual

assistance‖, ― ―outside aid‖, ― ―memorandums of understanding‖, ― ―memorandums of
agreement‖, ― ―letters of agreement‖, ― ―cooperative assistant agreement‖, ―
―intergovernmental compacts‖, or other similar agreements, written or verbal, that constitute an
agreed reciprocal assistance plan for sharing emergency services. MAAs between entities are an
effective means to obtain resources and should be developed whenever possible. MAAs should
be in writing, be reviewed by legal counsel, and be signed by a responsible official.
Mutual Support—That support which units render each other against any enemy because of
their assigned tasks, their position relative to each other and to the enemy and their inherent
capabilities.
National Defense Area (NDA)—An area established on non-Federal lands located within the
United States, its possessions, or territories for the purpose of safeguarding classified defense
information or protecting DOD equipment or material. Establishment of an NDA temporarily
places such non-Federal lands under the effective control of the DOD and results only from an
emergency event. The senior DOD representative at the scene will define the boundary, mark it
with a physical barrier, and post warning signs. The landowner’s consent and cooperation will be
obtained whenever possible; however, military necessity will dictate the final decision regarding
location, shape, and size of the NDA.
National Disaster Medical System (NDMS)—The NDMS is an integrated Federal, State, local,
and private sector medical response system for medical support during wartime or major United
States domestic disasters. NDMS provides DOD with medical care resources from the civilian
sector to back up the Veterans Administration and DOD medical contingency arrangement.
National Emergency—A condition declared by the President or Congress by virtue of powers
previously vested in them that authorize certain emergency actions to be undertaken in the
national interest. Action to be taken may include partial, full, or total mobilization of national
resources.
National Incident Management System (NIMS)—A system mandated by HSPD-5 that
provides a consistent, nationwide approach for Federal, State, local, and tribal governments; the
private sector; and nongovernmental organizations to work effectively and efficiently together to
prepare for, respond to, and recover from domestic incidents, regardless of cause, size, or
complexity. To provide for interoperability and compatibility among Federal, State, local, and
tribal capabilities, the NIMS includes a core set of concepts, principles, and terminology. HSPD-
5 identifies these as the ICS; multiagency coordination systems; training; identification, and
management of resources (including systems for classifying types of resources); qualification
and certification; and the collection, tracking, and reporting of incident information and incident
resources.
National Response System (NRS)—Pursuant to the National Contingency Plan, the mechanism
for coordinating response actions by all levels of government for oil and hazardous substances
spills and releases.

identify threats, determine vulnerabilities, and identify required resources.
Presumptive Identification—The tentative determination of a CBRNE material or pathogen’s
identity with sufficient specificity and confidence to make expedient, risk-based control
decisions until confirmatory identification can be completed.
Prevention—Actions to avoid an incident or to intervene to stop an incident from occurring.
Prevention involves actions to protect lives and property. It involves applying intelligence and
other information to a range of activities that may include such countermeasures as deterrence
operations; heightened inspections; improved surveillance and security operations; investigations
to determine the full nature and source of the threat; public health and agricultural surveillance
and testing processes; immunizations, isolation or quarantine; and, as appropriate, specific law
enforcement operations aimed at deterring, preempting, interdicting or disrupting illegal activity
and apprehending potential perpetrators and bringing them to justice.

treatment of affected persons; implement additional measures for community restoration;
incorporate mitigation measures and techniques, as feasible; evaluate the incident to identify
lessons learned; and develop initiatives to mitigate the effects of future incidents.
Regional Response Teams (RRT)—Regional counterparts to the National Response Team, the
RRTs comprise regional representatives of the Federal agencies on the NRT and representatives
of each State within the region. The RRTs serve as planning and preparedness bodies before a
response and provide coordination and advice to the Federal IC during response actions.
Response—Activities that address the short-term, direct effects of an incident. Response
includes immediate actions to save lives, protect property, and meet basic human needs.
Response also includes the execution of emergency operations plans and of incident mitigation
activities designed to limit the loss of life, personal injury, property damage, and other
unfavorable outcomes. As indicated by the situation, response activities include: applying
intelligence and other information to lessen the effects or consequences of an incident; increased
security operations; continuing investigations into the nature and source of the threat; ongoing
public health and agricultural surveillance and testing processes; immunizations, isolation or
quarantine; and specific law enforcement operations aimed at preempting, interdicting or
disrupting illegal activity and apprehending actual perpetrators and bringing them to justice.
Response Task Force (RTF)—A DOD response force appropriately staffed, trained, and
equipped to coordinate actions necessary to control and recover from a radiological accident. The
specific purpose of the RTF is to recover weapons and provide radiological accident assistance.
RTFs are organized and maintained by those Combatant Commanders whose Component

publication issued by the Military Agency for Standardization may be recorded as a STANAG.
Status-of-Forces Agreement (SOFA)—An agreement which defines the legal position of a
visiting military force deployed in the territory of a friendly state. Agreements delineating the
status of visiting military forces may be bilateral or multilateral. Provisions pertaining to the
status of visiting forces may be set forth in a separate agreement or they may form a part of a
more comprehensive agreement. These provisions describe how the authorities of a visiting
force may control members of that force and the amenability of the force or its members to the
local law or to the authority of local officials. To the extent that agreements delineate matters
affecting the relations between a military force and civilian authorities and population, they may
be considered as civil affairs agreements.
Straight-line Wind—Generally, any wind that is not associated with rotation, used mainly to
differentiate them from tornadic winds. The National Weather Service defines a strong straight-
line wind as a wind of 50 knots or higher. Also called a derecho.

assessments focus on the effectiveness of existing countermeasures, mitigation, and recovery
capabilities.
Weapon of Mass Destruction (WMD)—Weapons that are capable of a high order of
destruction or of being used in such a manner as to destroy large numbers of people. WMD can
be high explosives or nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological weapons, but exclude the
means of transporting or propelling the weapon where such means is a separable and divisible
part of the weapon.
WMD Civil Support Team (or National Guard Civil Support Team)—DOD has maintained
full-time Guard forces in Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams that are dedicated
to homeland security missions. These teams are comprised of 22 full-time personnel and are
maintained at the highest readiness levels and can respond rapidly to support civil authorities in
an event involving a weapon of mass destruction. Their role is to assist local officials in
determining the nature of the attack, provide medical and technical advice and help to identify
follow-on Federal and State assets that might be needed. Congress has authorized at least one
team for each State and territory. These teams are Federally funded and trained but perform their
mission under the command and control of the State governor.

                       EMERGENCY SUPPORT FUNCTIONS (ESF)

A2.1. ESFs are groupings of capabilities that provides the support, resources, program
implementation, and services that are most likely to be needed during emergency
response. ESFs serve as the primary operational-level mechanism that provides support during
an incident. These ESFs are modified from the NIMS/NRP construct to implement AFIMS.
AFIMS specifies that all phases of incident management will be the same regardless of the type
of incident; therefore, no unique wartime ESFs exist. See Table A2.1. Emergency Support
Functions – Scope, Offices of Primary Responsibility (OPR) and Offices of Collateral
Responsibility (OCR).
A2.1. (AEDC)Emergency Support Functions (ESFs) will be composed of Air Force or
contractor personnel, whichever is more appropriate and most qualified. ESF members
must have the authority to resolve issues and commit their respective organizational resources.
A2.2. Each ESF has an OPR and one or more OCRs. The OPR for each ESF is identified on
the basis of authorities, resources, and capabilities. The OCRs provide additional capabilities
within each ESF. More detailed guidance will be contained in AFMAN 10-2502 (currently in
draft coordination). Depending upon the scope and magnitude of the incident, the ICC and EOC
activate the appropriate ESFs to mobilize assets and deploy resources to support the incident.
ESFs are expected to support one another in carrying out their respective roles and
responsibilities. OPRs and OCRs should use the requirements of this AFI and the CEMP 10-2 to
carry out their responsibilities. OPRs are not functionally responsible for all specified ESF tasks,
but will coordinate the efforts of the OCRs in support of any given activity within the scope of
that ESF.
A2.2. (AEDC)704 CES/CC serves as the Base Civil Engineer (BCE), is the EM Program
Manager, and ensures assignment of personnel to appropriate ESFs. Table A3.5 (N/A)

                                         Attachment 3
      CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL, NUCLEAR, AND HIGH-YIELD
       EXPLOSIVE (CBRNE) INCIDENT SITE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

This attachment provides specific functional responsibilities for an integrated CBRNE
Response Program. These roles and responsibilities apply to terrorist use of CBRNE, CBRNE
attack, peacetime incidents involving CBRN, and naturally occurring disease outbreaks.

Table A3.1. Assumptions.
 1.      ―CBRNE Incident‖ includes the full spectrum of hazards, from industrial accidents to
         terrorist and enemy combatant attacks. In the early stages of CBRN incidents, the type of
         incident--accident, terrorist attack, or enemy combatant attack--may be unknown.
 2.      Roles and responsibilities listed in this attachment apply to terrorist use of WMD, CBRNE
         attack, and peacetime incidents involving CBRNE.
 3.      Home station and expeditionary roles, responsibilities, and basic capabilities should be
         seamless whenever possible to maximize proficiency in the CBRN response mission.
 4.      First Responders and Emergency Responders need HAZMAT training and certification
         commensurate with their roles and responsibilities to comply with domestic requirements. These
         requirements are outlined in Chapter 6, Attachment 5 and Attachment 6.
 5.      Training and equipment gaps between current capabilities and capabilities outlined in
         this instruction will be identified to MAJCOMs for oversight and resolution.
 6.      The CE Environmental Officer is OPR for HAZMAT cleanup and site restoration operations
         in CBRN hazard environments. Incident site control will not be transferred to cleanup and
         restoration operations until adequate capability is in place for safe and healthy operations.
 7.      Roles and responsibilities outlined in the following tables represent tasks performed in support
         of the IC through any designated OPR agency.
 8.      All responders will be trained that a CBRN incident site may be a crime scene. Scene
         preservation, evidence handling, and chain of custody procedures will be included in
         training, evaluation, planning, response, and recovery.
 9.      There is no single OPR for monitoring operations.

Table A3.2. Bioenvironmental Engineer.
 NOTE: Activities listed are for health risk assessment.
 1.  Incident Command (IC)           May assume IC for recovery operations where health risk
                                     assessment is the primary mission.
                                     Supports IC throughout a CBRN event.
 2.  Detection                       Supports planning for deployment of detection network.
                                     Supports CE Readiness with active and passive CBRN detection
                                     when additional manpower or equipment is required or as
                                     requested.
                                     Supports contamination footprint definition and hazard location
                                     when additional manpower or equipment is required or requested.

                                  CBRN materials and pathogens in support of health risk
                                  assessment and health hazard control, but not for risk assessment.
                                  Performs presumptive CBRN agent identification.
 4.    Quantify (Hazard           Quantifies CBRN materials, pathogens, and hazardous conditions
       Concentrations)            to support health risk assessment and health hazard control.
 5.    Monitoring                 Conducts active and passive monitoring to determine
                                  contamination extent, hazard conditions changes and personnel
                                  dose estimates to support health risk assessment and health hazard
                                  control.
 6.    Decontamination            Supports decontamination planning through health risk
                                  assessment of procedures.
                                  Provides real-time monitoring if assets are available.
 7.    Sampling                   Collects samples from an incident site including packaging,
                                  preserving, and transporting to support health risk assessment and
                                  health hazard control with CE Readiness assistance.

    SECURITY FORCES (SF) HAZARDOUS MATERIALS (HAZMAT) TRAINING

A5.1. Security Forces (SF) are Emergency Responders for HAZMAT events and provide
support to First Responders. SF personnel do not fill the traditional roles and responsibilities of
civil law enforcement agencies during HAZMAT events and will not investigate or operate in
suspected warm or hot zones. SF will take no further action beyond the following:
   A5.1.1. Initiating the alarm sequence.
   A5.1.2. Providing entry control point management.
   A5.1.3. Performing cordon security to support the IC
   A5.1.4. Providing counter-attack to protect mission critical resources. SF commanders must
   weight the risk to forces by understanding the protective capabilities of SF IPE and the
   environment the force will be expected to operate in before committing an assault force. See
   AFTTP(I) 3-2.46, Multiservice Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Nuclear, Biological,
   and Chemical (NBC) Protection, for information on assessment of NBC filter performance as
   they relate to protection against selected TICs.
A5.2. As a minimum, Installation Entry Controllers, law enforcement patrols, security patrol
members/ leaders, SF personnel who may perform initial C2, Desk Sergeants and Flight
Chiefs/Commanders require SF-specific HAZMAT awareness training for their position IAW
paragraphs A5.4 – A5.6.
A5.3. Because SF roles in HAZMAT response are limited to cordon and entry control, most SF
personnel do not need the HAZMAT Awareness Course offered by CE.
   A5.3.1. SF commanders will determine the capability required by any function that might
   serve as IC IAW paragraph 2.4.2.5, based upon the installation threat and risk. The SF
   commander must set the appropriate level of training for each position. This determination
   must be made as part of the training process rather than during the response process.
   A5.3.2. The commander will use SF HAZMAT trainers who have completed the DOD
   HAZMAT certification process to task certify personnel. The commander should consider
   including initial SF HAZMAT Awareness be part of newcomers training.
   A5.3.3. Unit trainers will complete a plan of instruction and lesson plans IAW AFMAN 36-
   2234, Instructional System Development and AFH 36-2235, Volume 11, Information for
   Designers of Instructional Systems Application to Unit Training, to ensure long-term
   uniformity and continuity. SF trainers can reference the HAZMAT Emergency Response
   Training Awareness CD-ROM, CEMP 10-2.
   A5.3.4. Initial and annual SF Standardization Evaluations will include HAZMAT evaluation
   of the areas identified in paragraphs A5.3.1 – A5.3.3.
A5.4. As a minimum, Installation Entry Controllers and Internal and External Security Response
Team (I/ESRT) members will be certified to:
