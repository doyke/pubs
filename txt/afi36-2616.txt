                        HAF TECHNICAL TRAINING PROGRAMS

2.1. Enlisted Initial Skills (EIS). EIS reflects the total validated enlisted technical training
requirements necessary for force sustainment in each Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC). It
includes initial skills technical training requirements for ADAF, ANG, AFR, Sister Service,
International, and Civilian personnel.
   2.1.1. Trained Personnel Requirement (TPR). TPR states the AF need for trained personnel
   by AFSC. Out of this requirement, Air Staff projects training and retraining required by FY
   to keep the active enlisted force at manning levels needed by the Air Force. Air Staff
   communicates the TPR to AETC (the process to satisfy TPR is not limited to AETC formal
   schools) as the total Air Force production requirements for a given AFSC. The TPR
   categories are non-prior service (NPS), prior service (PS), and retrainees (RET). It does not
   include ANG, AFRC, Sister Service, International or Civilian personnel.
   2.1.2. Student Training Requirement (STR). STR is the sum of ANG, AFRC, Sister Service,
   International, and civilian training requirements for IST. It represents all resource categories
   except ADAF NPS, PS, and RET.
2.2. Officer Initial Skills (OIS). OIS reflects the non-rated officer technical training
requirements for force sustainment in each Officer AFSC. It includes initial skills technical
training requirements for ADAF, ANG, AFR, International, and Civilian personnel.
2.3. Mission Readiness Training Program (MRTP). MRTP reflects TDY-to-School
centrally-funded and locally-funded baselines for AF directed and MAJCOM (Warfighter and
Support) technical training requirements (prior service, retraining, supplemental, 7-Level, etc.).
2.4. Trained Dog Requirements (TDR). TDR reflects the Military Working Dog technical
training requirements for sustainment across the AF.
2.5. Field Training (FT) (Type-4). FT reflects TDY and TDY en route funds to achieve
mission requirements through technical training at Field Training Detachments (FTDs).
2.6. Non-Resident (NR) Training (Type-6). NR training reflects requirements to fund
analysis, design, implementation and maintenance for NR courses.
2.7. Linguist. Linguist reflects validated technical training requirements necessary for force
sustainment in linguist AFSCs. It includes initial skills technical training requirements for
ADAF, ANG, AFRC, Sister Service, International, and Civilian personnel.

                HAF TECHNICAL TRAINING TASKING DOCUMENTS

3.1. Tasking Documents. Technical Training requirements must be aligned with the Planning,
Programming, Budgeting, and Execution system (PPBE). The primary vehicles that capture and
align training requirements to resources are the Program Requirements Document (PRD) and the
Program Guidance Letter (PGL). See Table 3.1 for PGL/PRD Programs and Users.
   3.1.1. Technical Training Data Call.           AF/A1PT disseminates an annual Training
   Requirements Data Call Message that provides guidance and timelines for submitting
   Technical Training (TT) requirements for three out-years. TRQI managers input their
   training requirements into the MilPDS/OTA. Those requirements flow to the Training
   Planning System (TPS) where the Training Manager (TM) validates training requirements
   and builds class schedules. Those schedules then flow back to OTA to the TRQIs for sub
   allocation (loading of names) and execution. Specific timelines and deadlines are provided
   in the data call. EXCEPTIONS: The process of establishing the ADAF linguist (1A8X1 and
   1N3XX) training requirements is different from all other enlisted career fields. The specific
   ADAF shred and language requirements are established by the AFCFMs. The Army is the
   Executive Agent for Global language training. Therefore, the AF must follow the Army’s
   process and timeline for requesting and updating linguist training requirements. AF linguist
   out-year requirements are projected at the annual Structure Manning Decision Review
   (SMDR). In addition, execution year and out year linguist training requirements are
   reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis at the Training Requirement Arbitration Panel
   (TRAP). HQ AETC/A3P serves as the AF requirements manager for language training. The
   process of establishing sister service/other agency training requirements differs from enlisted
   career fields where training is provided by AF. Where sister services/other agencies are the
   training providers, HQ AETC/A3P serves as the AF requirements manager for sister
   service/other agency training.
   3.1.2. Program Requirements Documents (PRD). It enables planners and programmers to
   program necessary resources to support out-year Air Force (AF) technical training
   requirements (e.g., current year +3). The PRD identifies “unconstrained” or “unfunded” out-
   year technical training requirements.
   3.1.3. Program Requirements Documents (PGL). The PGL serves as the official tasking
   document reflecting Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS) acknowledgement of the
   technical training requirements (current year +2; e.g.); the requirements briefing to the AFCS
   highlights there will be training bills in the upcoming POM. The PGL identifies
   “constrained” or “funded” technical training requirements.
3.2. PGL/PRD Requirements Program Users. The technical training requirements are
identified for each of the programs shown in Table 3.1 below. Each program has a set of
requirements documents that is broken down by users, called TRQIs. TRQIs are four-character
communication codes within MilPDS/OTA used to convey annual or supplemental training
requirements, quota allocations, quota confirmations, and student-tracking information between a
training user and the training provider (owner). The AF assigns TRQIs to MAJCOMS, FOAs,
and DRUs to ensure training accountability.

                    CAPACITY ASSESSMENT AND CONSTRAINTS

4.1. Tasking. Upon receiving the draft PGL from AF/A1PT, AETC assesses capacity to
determine capability to train stated requirements.
4.2. Schoolhouse Capacity Assessment. This assessment includes course level schoolhouse
capacity and aggregate installation level BOS (base operating support) and Basic Military
Training (BMT) capacity.       Technical Training constraints include AETC and Sister
Service/Other Agency limitations and shortfalls.
4.3. Constraints. If entries identified on the PTT exceed existing schoolhouse capacity,
schoolhouse personnel complete a constraint worksheet that identifies any combination of
facility, equipment, BOS, and/or instructor limitations. AETC identifies these constraints to
AF/A1PT if these resource shortfalls cannot be met within the MAJCOM. For EIS and OIS,
AF/A1PT uses the constraints identified (e.g., facility, equipment, BOS) to advocate for
additional resources to unconstraint the AFSC/course. When the PGL constraint/delta cannot be
resolved immediately, the AF/A1PT staff will consider the re-distribution of the active duty
training requirement delta to other AFSC(s).
4.4. AETC Process. The capacity and constraint processes are covered in more detail in
AETCI 36-2215.

5.2. Officer Initial Skills. The Officer Accession Working Group (OA-WG) drives out-year
accession targets by commissioning source (Officer Training School, ROTC, and US Air Force
Academy) and AFSC. This is done by evaluating current manning, promotion rates and other
factors. The out year accession targets are categorized by accession source. These targets are the
goals that the commissioning sources are tasked to meet. Due to the large majority of accessions
(approx 70%) graduating in the May/Jun timeframe, it is difficult to match targets to training
opportunities and many newly accessed officers will not be trained in the same FY in which they
are accessed.

training requirements for the following programs: MRTP, TDR, Non-Resident, and Field
Training. The AF/A1PT Data Call Message (DCM) triggers a critical data gathering point for all
out-year Technical Training requirements.
    5.3.1. AETC/A3P works pre-scheduling requirements and prepares the MRT, Non-Resident,
    TDR, and FTD spreadsheets.
    5.3.2. AETC/A3P co-chairs an annual MRTP Working Group to educate TRQI managers,
    and establish out-year requirements to be incorporated into the PGLs/PRDs.

          PGL CHANGES (ADJUSTMENTS AND QUOTA MANAGEMENT)

6.1. PGL Adjustments.
   6.1.1. AF/A1PT transmits budget year and execution year adjustments to AETC representing
   customer requirements.
   6.1.2. When AF/A1PT requests proposed adjustments to the PGL, AETC/A3P updates the
   PTT to identify the proposed change to the specific pipeline(s) and posts it to the appropriate
   electronic portal site. AETC/A3P then staffs an ESSS (with link to website) with all
   appropriate organizations (AETC, A-Staffs, 2AF/TTOC, AFPC, etc) requesting impacted
   organizations assess capacity and identify if all, part or none of the proposed change
   (increase/decrease) can be implemented with existing resources. Once notification is
   received identifying what part of the change can be supported, AETC/A3PZ updates the
   applicable PTT with the portion that can be executed and notifies AF/A1PT of the portion
   that could not be supported without additional resources. If additional resources are required,
   AETC/A3P notifies AETC/A3R (and/or other users of required unfunded resources). For
   ADAF, A3R will request that an unfunded requirement submission be placed in the
   execution plan to AFCS. For non-ADAF, AF/A1PT will work with other users to resolve
   resource shortfalls. The applicable PTT will not be updated with the proposed change until
   the resources are procured. Exception: AETC/A3PZ updates applicable MRT PTT and/or
   relevant requirements (i.e., TDR and Non-Resident) only after completion of capacity and
   resource assessments and final approval from AF/A1PT.
      6.1.2.1. Active Duty AF (ADAF) Adjustments. AF/A1PT approval is required because
      of implications to AF end strength, accession balancing, and overall career field
      sustainment; follow the process in 6.1.2.
      6.1.2.2. Non-ADAF (Other Users) Adjustments. Follow the Quota Management
      Adjustment process in 6.2 when non-ADAF Tech Training users request scheduled
      unfilled seats. This process assumes post-scheduling activity. If EIS/OIS/MRT
      changes/adjustments affect resources, multiple FYs, or multiple PGLs, use process in
      6.1.2.
6.2. Quota Management
   6.2.1. Quota Management (QM) is the operation of swapping or moving scheduled quotas
   between non-ADAF users or requesting use of another non-ADAF training user’s future
   scheduled unfilled seats. AF customers manage quotas during the execution year to ensure
   the most efficient use of training resources. The QM authority requires properly completed
   worksheets for quota movements and out-of-cycles promoting a QM discipline among AF
   customers and reducing risks of erroneous or unintended actions. All TRQI Managers are
   eligible to make quota management requests except for Active Duty TRQIs (ADAF NPS,
   ADAF PS, and ADAF RET). The QM authority may reallocate scheduled training quotas
   after coordination with the TM for the following resource categories in the execution year:
   ANG, AFRC, Sister Services, Internationals and Civilians. TRQI Managers may request QM
 18                                                               AFI 36-2616 24 APRIL 2013


   actions (except for Active Duty TRQIs) to the QM authority using the prescribed worksheets.
   The QM authority and the affected TM will coordinate on each request.
   6.2.2. The TRQI Manager uses the Training Quota Movement Worksheet to request a
   movement of quota(s) from one class to another class and convert quota types (whether it is
   for the first or second digit). This can be done for a class-to-class move or a same class seat
   conversion. For EIS and OIS, the TRQI Manager’s total number of quotas in the course
   should not increase or decrease without AF/A1PT approval.
      6.2.2.1. For MRT courses under 2 AF purview, the TRQI Manager sends all completed
      worksheets impacting AP/OP/CP quota types (See 7.4 for definition) and AN/ON/CN
      quota types to the appropriate 2 AF/TTOC-P Program Manager and all completed
      worksheets impacting AT/OT/CT quota types to 2 AF/TTOC-O MRTP Execution
      Manager. NOTE: Ensure the e-mail subject line includes the Course Number and Class
      Start Date (CSD). For technical training initial skills courses, submit change requests to
      AETC/A3PZ.
      6.2.2.2. For MRTP, the TRQI Manager uses the Out-of-Cycle (OoC) Request Worksheet
      to request the use of another training user’s unfilled seats or request new seats be added.
6.3. AETC Process. Refer to AETCI 36-2215 for further details on AETC’s role in
requirement adjustments and quota management.
AFI 36-2616 24 APRIL 2013                                                                         19


                                            Chapter 7

                      MISSION READINESS TRAINING PROGRAM

7.1. General Information. The MRTP objectives are to develop and maintain professional and
technical skills, knowledge, and abilities to meet AF needs. The MRTP provides travel, per
diem, lodging, and special authorization funds for AETC (CONUS) formal training courses to
aid mission accomplishment. It provides advanced, supplemental, and residential craftsmen
technical training for courses of up to 99 academic days (less than 20 calendar weeks), for
officers, enlisted and civilian personnel when other types of training such as OJT, unit training,
exportable, or mobile training will not satisfy the need. In addition, Department of the Air Force
civilians, foreign direct or indirect hires in valid DoD positions, non-appropriated fund (NAF)
employees in validated (appropriated funded/unfunded) Services manpower positions, or foreign
exchange military officers filling AF validated UMD positions are authorized to utilize AETC
central funds.
7.2. Scope/Structure. The MRTP is a key part of the AF’s training resource and plays a vital
role in maintaining readiness and a quality force. It consists of two categories – AFD training
and MAJCOM (Warfighter/Support) training. During the identification and validation process,
training requirements must be priority ranked based on levels of training urgency. MRTP
requirements will be categorized as Priority Level-1 (Mission Accomplishment), Priority Level-2
(Mission Sustainment) or Priority Level-3 (Mission Enhancement). The MRTP functions
through a series of processes ensuring mission accomplishment training (Priority Level-1) is
accomplished first and that there is a maximum use of Funding Level-1 (AETC centrally-funded
allocations, “T”-Allocations). The MRTP includes the following types of training:
   7.2.1. AFD training. Training in support of TPR to replenish and balance the force. It
   ensures enough trained personnel are in each skill to accomplish the AF mission. It also
   includes training incidental to assignment action, certain special assignments, upgrade
   training, promotions, and unique training as specified by Air Staff. AFD training
   requirements are categorized as Priority Level-1 and include:
   7.2.2. AF Legal Services. Centralized supplemental training for AF legal officers.
   7.2.3. Colonel’s Group. Training support for officers identified by the Colonel’s Group.
   7.2.4. Senior Leader’s Group. Training for General Officers and Senior Executive Service
   (SES) civilians.
   7.2.5. Lateral Training. Enlisted personnel retraining into a career field that does not accept
   ADAF NPS students; such pipelines are called lateral skills.
   7.2.6. NPS Training (Initial). NPS enlisted personnel who flow from an initial skills course
   of 20 calendar weeks or longer into an initial skills course shorter than 20 weeks. These
   personnel are still in the training pipeline; however, since their first initial skills course was
   20 weeks or longer [Permanent Change of Station (PCS)], any subsequent training at a
   different location that is up to 99 academic days (shorter than 20 calendar weeks) entitles the
   member to per diem and is classified as a Temporary Duty (TDY). In accordance with the
   Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR), only Funding Level-1 (AETC Centrally-
 20                                                                AFI 36-2616 24 APRIL 2013


   funded)/Priority Level-1 allocations are used for individuals attending these initial skills
   courses; medical courses are funded by the servicing command.
   7.2.7. NPS Training (Follow-on). NPS enlisted personnel (see paragraph 7.2.6.) continuing
   their initial skills training in follow-on courses. These personnel are still in the pipeline;
   however, since their first initial skills course is 20 calendar weeks or longer and classified as
   a PCS, any subsequent training of up to 99 academic days (shorter than 20 calendar weeks)
   entitles the member to per diem and is classified as a TDY. In accordance with the JFTR,
   only Funding Level-1 (AETC Centrally-funded)/Priority Level-1 allocations are used for
   individuals attending MRT-approved courses for these follow-on courses; medical courses
   are funded by the servicing command.
   7.2.8. Officer Accessions. Initial skills training for all new officer accessions following their
   commission through Officer Training School (OTS), Reserve Officer Training Corps
   (ROTC), or USAF Academy.
   7.2.9. Advanced Training. Officer and enlisted advanced training.
   7.2.10. Officer Cross-flow. Initial skills training for all officers cross-flowing or retraining
   into a new AFSC.
   7.2.11. Palace Acquire. Training for newly acquired civilian employees under AFPC’s
   Palace Acquire intern program.
   7.2.12. PME Assignments. TDY en route training for officers requiring prerequisite
   language training prior to attending foreign PME courses. MRTP only funds language
   training, which is up to 99 academic days (or less than 20 calendar weeks), and does not fund
   any part of the PME course. The majority of officers attending prerequisite language training
   attend in a PCS status.
   7.2.13. Retraining (Initial). Enlisted personnel retraining into new career fields.
   7.2.14. Retraining (Follow-on). Enlisted personnel continuing their retraining in follow-on
   pipeline courses.
   7.2.15. ADAF Prior Service. Prior service enlisted personnel who require all or part of a
   training pipeline to meet career field qualifications leading to award of the 3 skill level.
   7.2.16. Recruiter and Instructor. Enlisted personnel attending the Basic Recruiter, Military
   Training Instructor, or Military Training Leader course.
   7.2.17. Secretary of the AF Public Affairs. Advanced training for senior Non-commissioned
   Officers/Officers in the Public Affairs career field.
   7.2.18. Support Officers. Normally, related to embassy and attaché assignments.
   7.2.19. 7-Level Craftsman Training. Upgrade training for all active duty military attending
   resident 7-Level Craftsman courses.
7.3. MRTP Funding & Priority Levels.
   7.3.1. MRTP Funding Levels. Mission Readiness Training allocations are divided into two
   funding categories: Funding Level-1 and Funding Level-2.
AFI 36-2616 24 APRIL 2013                                                                       21


       7.3.1.1. MRTP Funding Level-1 – AETC TDY-to-School centrally funded quotas;
       identified with a “T” in the 2d position of the quota type (Example: AT, OT, or CT).
       7.3.1.2. MRTP Funding Level-2 – Unit or other than AETC centrally funded quota;
       identified with a “P” or “N” in the 2d position of the quota type (Example: AP, OP, CP,
       AN, ON, or CN). See “Quota Type” definition for detailed breakout information.
   7.3.2. Mission Readiness Training must be prioritized by each MAJCOM and/or
   organization according to its capabilities to meet the user’s mission. Use the following
   priority level definitions:
       7.3.2.1. Priority Level-1 (Mission Accomplishment). Accomplishment of the AF
       mission objective will not occur if training requirement is not satisfied. Requestor(s) will
       fund their requirement(s) if not supported by MRTP funding.
       7.3.2.2. Priority Level-2 (Mission Sustainment). Training required to sustain the AF’s
       readiness posture.
       7.3.2.3. Priority Level-3 (Mission Enhancement). Training fosters the effective use of
       resources to enhance the AF’s mission capability.
   7.3.3. Funding Level and Priority Level Relationships.
       7.3.3.1. Funding Level-1/Priority Level-1 (T-quotas). These quotas are AETC centrally
       funded requirements and represent training the user considers essential to mission
       accomplishment. This total requirement will not exceed the Funding Level-1 baseline
       stated in the MRT PGL or PRD issued by AF/A1P.
       7.3.3.2. Funding Level-2/Priority Level-1 (P/N-quotas). These quotas are “must have”
       requirements, regardless of funding, for training the user considers mission
       accomplishment (essential). These quotas represent the requirement needs above the
       user’s Funding Level-1 MRT PGL baseline and will be reflected on an AF IMT 3933,
       MAJCOM Mission Training Request. The user acknowledges the certification statement
       of AF IMT 3933; Section III - this training requirement meets the criteria for Priority
       Level-1 urgency, and if AF funds cannot support the request, then unit funds will be
       utilized.
       7.3.3.3. Funding Level-2/Priority Level-2/3 (P/N-quotas). These quotas are unit funded
       and represent requirements for training the user considers mission sustainment (Priority-
       2) or mission enhancement (Priority-3) and will be budgeted for within the unit. The
       total requirement of Funding Level 2/Priority Levels-2/3 (P/N-quotas) cannot exceed the
       Funding Level-2 (unit funded) baseline stated in the AF/A1PT issued MRT PGL. Quotas
       above the Funding Level-2 (P/N-quota) baseline represent additional requirement needs
       and will be reflected on an AF IMT 3933, request for increase.
       7.3.3.4. The schoolhouse must accommodate all Funding Level-1/Priority Level-1
       requirements before they fulfill any lower Funding Level/Priority Level requirements.
7.4. Quota Type. A two-character code within MilPDS/OTA used to indicate the student's
active duty status (i.e., Airman, Officer, or Civilian) and the travel funding status (i.e. AETC
Centrally-funded, Unit-funded, or non-TDY). The particular codes are as follows, with the
understanding that any code in the 1st position can be paired with any code in the 2nd position:
 22                                                                AFI 36-2616 24 APRIL 2013


Table 7.1. Quota Type Breakdown (MRTP).
1st Digit (Active Duty Status)                   2nd Digit (Travel Funding Status)
A (Airman)                                       T (AETC – Centrally funded; TDY-to-School
O (Officer)                                      P (Unit funded, see Note 1)
C (Civilian)                                     N (Other, see Note 2)
                                   nd
NOTE 1: “P” may be used in the 2 digit if the student is co-located with the training location.
NOTE 2: “N” funding status is usually used for NPS pipeline students, PCS-length schools (20
calendar weeks or longer), Contractors, Foreign Nationals, or non-active duty AF users.
7.5. Special Funding Restrictions.
   7.5.1. Funding for ADAF and Civilian personnel assigned or on permanent duty within DoD
   activities, unified commands or Joint Service activities is the responsibility of the activity to
   which they are assigned. AETC funds will not be used.
   7.5.2. Students who are not AF members are funded by the branch of service or federal
   agency to which they are assigned.
   7.5.3. AETC MRTP funds will not be used to support training of contractor personnel.
   7.5.4. Travel and per diem expenses for students or instructors at “command” courses are the
   funding responsibility of the AF activity to which the individual student or instructor is
   assigned.
   7.5.5. ANG students are funded by the state publishing the travel orders.
   7.5.6. HQ AFRC funds AF Reserve members and Air Reserve Technicians (ART) with
   military allocations. However, AETC will fund civilians and active duty members assigned
   to AFRC and ART with civilian allocations, with the same limitations as for active duty
   personnel within their allocated baseline.
   7.5.7. The Unit Training Manager (UTM) and supervisor will ensure students are fully
   qualified to attend/enrolled in required courses. The schoolhouse will contact the servicing
   FSS, who will direct the return of the students to their parent organization as a result of being
   unqualified to enter an AF training program course. The members unit will bear all TDY
   expenses to and from the school. If the school finds the member unqualified for training, the
   member’s orders issuing authority will immediately amend the orders. The organization
   selecting and publishing orders on the student concerned will ensure the orders are amended
   to reflect the parent unit’s fund citation. A copy of this amendment must be sent to 12
   CPTS/FMFLT, Randolph AFB TX.
   7.5.8. AETC MRTP Technical Training funds will not be used for: Special Contract
   Training (Type-1), Field Training Detachment (Type-4), DL (non-resident) Training (Type-
   6), or Mobile Training Teams (Type-7) courses. Exception: Any MRTP Eligible TRQIs
   attending CONUS Type-7 courses may be funded out of the MRT Program.
   7.5.9. Courses that are 20 calendar weeks or longer are considered a PCS and AETC MRTP
   funds are not authorized for the travel, per diem, lodging or special authorization expenses.
   All expenses will be charged to the PCS fund citation. Additionally, students are considered
   to be in a PCS status when attending two or more courses at one location and the courses,
   combined, total 20 weeks or longer in duration.
AFI 36-2616 24 APRIL 2013                                                                      23


   7.5.10. The travel, per diem, lodging, and special authorization expenses for attendance to
   AU, AFIT (Air Force Institute of Technology), flying, survival, medical, and command
   specific courses are not funded with AETC MRTP funds.
7.6. Special Authorizations.
   7.6.1. When the AETC TDY-to-School fund-cite is used on orders, it is only for normal
   travel, per diem and lodging for non-pipeline student allowance. The FSS or student must
   request and receive prior approval from 2 AF/TTOC-O MRTP for any additional
   expenditure(s) before including special authorizations in orders that use the AETC TDY-to-
   School Central Fund-cite. Special authorizations include, but are not limited to, rental cars
   and vicinity mileage, when requested as more advantageous to the government. Requests are
   evaluated on a case-by-case basis and will not be approved solely for the convenience of the
   member.
   7.6.2. 2AF/TTOC-O MRTP is the MRTP point of contact (POC) for all Technical Training
   (to include 7-level) special authorization requests. All individuals requesting special
   authorizations involving the use of AETC Centralized funds will submit their requests
   through their servicing FSS formal training/base training office or Commander’s Support
   Staff. 2 AF/TTOC-O MRTP will process the request in order of receipt. NOTE: 2
   AF/TTOC-O MRTP does not process special authorizations for Flying, Medical, Survival,
   AFIT, Defense Acquisition University, and Air University training because those
   organizations have their own POCs and approval processes.
   7.6.3. In a memorandum for record, requests must include the member's full name, Social
   Security Number (SSN), course number, class start and graduation dates, full justification,
   and a POC (with telephone and fax numbers). Requests should be received NLT seven duty
   days prior to CSD.
       7.6.3.1. Students/Travelers must provide a Non-Availability Letter/Statement, if billeted
       off base and requesting a rental car or vicinity mileage. Approved vicinity mileage
       requests will be processed upon the completion of the course.
       7.6.3.2. Students/Travelers must provide a copy of TDY orders (both front and back) to
       2 AF/TTOC-O MRTP, if published.
       7.6.3.3. Prior to CSD, students must refer to http://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/ for the
       availability of service lodging and dining facilities at each installation.
       7.6.3.4. Rental cars are issued one per five AETC Centrally-funded students per class
       and are authorized on a first come, first serve basis. AETC Centrally-funded students
       take passenger precedence over any other student(s).
       7.6.3.5. If approved, vicinity mileage is paid for training days only and is defined as the
       distance to/from school; the distance from the off-base quarters to training location.
       Example: Four miles from hotel to base x 2 = 8 round trip miles x training days.
       7.6.3.6. Vicinity mileage may not be authorized if government transportation has been
       provided by 2 AF/TTOC-O MRTP, i.e., maximum rental cars have been provided for a
       class.
24                                                            AFI 36-2616 24 APRIL 2013


     7.6.3.7. Approval of special authorizations must be received by 2 AF/TTOC-O MRTP
     prior to travel of the trainee and stated in the member's travel orders (except vicinity
     mileage requests). If not, amendments to member’s orders will be accomplished.
     7.6.3.8. Eligible members traveling by air requiring additional clothing may be
     authorized excess baggage because training extends over two seasons or special
     circumstances dictate additional gear described in the ETCA and justified by 2
     AF/TTOC-O MRTP.
     7.6.3.9. Eligible members who drive their Privately Owned Vehicles (POV) are not
     authorized shipment of household goods or Do-It-Yourself (DITY) moves. Members
     who PCS with TDY en route may request shipment of household goods under PCS funds
     and not MRTP TDY funds.
     7.6.3.10. Request for shipping of household goods/DITY moves for TDY personnel are
     usually disapproved. All required items should already be at the training location.

Terms
Accession— Newly commissioned officer or new enlisted recruit coming on extended active
duty with no prior military service.
Accessions Program Guidance Letter (APGL)— AF/A1M document identifying aggregate
enlisted (NPS and PS) and officer (Rated and Non-Rated; Line and Non-Line) accession levels
for a given FY.
Advanced Training (AT)— Formal course that provides individuals who are qualified in one or
more positions of their Air Force Specialty (AFS) with additional skills and knowledge to
enhance their expertise in the career field. Training is for selected career airmen at the advanced
level of the AFS.
Air Force Career Field Manager— OPR appointed to ensure assigned AF specialties are
trained and utilized to support AF mission requirements. Works in concert with MAJCOM,
FOA, DRU, ANG, and AFRC Functional Managers (FMs) as required.
Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS)— Embodies the corporate review process for HQ
USAF. The primary groups of the Corporate Structure are the AF Council, the AF Board, the
AF Group, the fourteen Mission and Mission Support Panels, and Integrated Process Teams.
This structure increases management effectiveness and improves cross-functional decision-
making by providing a forum in which senior AF leadership can apply their collective judgment
and experience to major programs, objectives, and issues. This process balances programs
among mission areas, between force structure and support, and between readiness and
modernization. Only military or Department of Defense civilian personnel assigned to the Air
Staff or Office of the Secretary of the AF may serve as members of the corporate structure.
Air Force Specialty— A group of positions (with the same title and code) that require common
qualifications.
Air Reserve Component (ARC)— This term is used as an overarching term when referring to
both the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve together.
Allocation— A class seat reserved for a specific program user at their request.
Base Operating Support (BOS) Capacity— Limited by the installation infrastructure support
such as dining and dormitory capacity.
Capacity Parameters— Factors that limit training capacity must be well-defined in order to
identify the appropriate resources to resolve them. Capacity in light of each variable must be
readily available and reportable to HHQ upon request.
Craftsman Course— Course required by the CFETP to attain a 7-level AFSC award.
Data Call— Process of polling users of AF training programs to capture their technical training
requirements triggered by the Data Call Message (DCM).
Enlisted Initial Skills Training— A formal training pipeline that results in an upgrade to a 3-
skill level award in an AFS.
Execution Year— The current FY.
 30                                                               AFI 36-2616 24 APRIL 2013


Field Training— Technical, operator, and other training either a TD or mobile training team
conducts at operational locations on specific systems and associated direct-support equipment for
maintenance and aircrew personnel.
Functional Manager— Senior leaders designated by the appropriate functional authority, who
provides day-to-day management responsibility over specific functional communities at the
MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, or ARC level. While they should maintain an institutional focus in
regards to resource development and distribution, FMs are responsible for ensuring their
specialties are equipped, developed, and sustained to meet the functional community’s mission
as well as encourage force development opportunities in order to meet future needs of the total
AF mission.
Future Years Defense Program (FYDP)— The official DoD database summarizing resources
(Total Obligational Authority (TOA), personnel and forces) associated with DoD programs
approved by the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of Defense by fiscal year. The FYDP compiles
total resources (forces, manpower, funding) programmed for DoD over a specified period of
time.
Initials Skills Training (IST)— Used as an overarching term for EIS and OIS. A formal school
course that result in an AFSC 3-skill level award for enlisted or mandatory training for upgrade
to qualified officers.
Instructor Capacity— Limited by the number of authorized instructors that are on station.
Mission Readiness Training (MRT)— Formal training courses to aid mission accomplishment.
MRT provides advanced, supplemental and residential craftsman technical training for courses of
up to 99 academic days (less than 20 weeks), for officers, enlisted and civilian personnel when
other types of training (OJT, unit training, and exportable and mobile training) will not satisfy
the need.
Priority 1 (Mission Accomplishment) Requirement— Accomplishment of the Air Force
mission objective will not occur if training requirement is not satisfied. Requestor(s) will fund
their requirement(s) if not supported by AF funding.
Priority 2 (Mission Sustainment)— Training required to maintain the AF’s readiness posture.
Priority 3 (Mission Enhancement)— Training that fosters the effective use of resources to
improve the AF’s mission capability.
Mission Readiness Training Program Working Group— The annual MRTP Working Group
is hosted by AETC, co-chaired by AF/A1PT, and focuses on the education of TRQI Managers,
MAJCOM Functional Managers, and/or their representatives. In addition, the conference is the
forum where TRQI baseline adjustments can be made. Finally, it offers an opportunity for all
parts of the MRTP process to interact and share new information, while addressing any areas of
concern, i.e., increased mission requirements that may impact execution rates.
Major Command (MAJCOM)— A MAJCOM is the highest level of command, only below
Headquarters Air Force (HAF), and directly above Numbered Air Forces (NAF).
Mission Driven Changes— Those changes in requirements resulting from changes in force
structure or mission requirements.
AFI 36-2616 24 APRIL 2013                                                                        31


Officer Accession Working Group— The OA-WG is scheduled annually to discuss the officer
initial skills requirements. The conference focuses first on finalization of Sources of
Commission (SOCs) accession targets, followed by officer training requirements from other
users, including Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, internationals and civilians. Also,
course capacity, constraints, and shortfalls are identified and addressed.
Officer Initial Skills Training— Provides skill sets required to be successful in awarded AFSC.
Officer initial skills training is not AFSC awarding, but is used in conjunction with experience,
OJT, and other supplemental training to provide required skill sets.
Program Guidance Letter (PGL)— Establishes training requirements for AETC execution.
PGLs are the official tasking documents enabling AETC planners and programmers to acquire
the necessary resources for accomplishment of the tasking. The PGLs align the AF requirements
with the PPBE process. Includes EIS, OIS, TDR, MRT, FT, and NR training. If the funding
changes in the DoD POM process, AF/A1 determines how the changes will affect the PGL and
publishes official amendments as necessary.
PGL Adjustment— HAF directed changes that modify a PGL baseline (i.e. increases) because
of out-of-cycle training requests that occur during budget or execution year. Also may include
HAF directed changes made to PGL training requirements resulting in a change to AETC
aggregate funding.
Program Objective Memorandum (POM)— OSD directed, service developed document
identifying money, people and equipment requirements and allocations over a specified period of
time, covering a five year period (e.g., FY13-17). POM funding baselines are used to develop
budget level detail for distribution of resources during budget execution years. The POM is
developed by individual services to set objectives for their forces, weapon systems and logistical
support within the fiscal limits assigned to them by the Secretary of Defense.
Program Requirements Document (PRD)— AF/A1P documents (EIS, OIS, TDR, MRT, FT,
NR, and Linguist) used to transmit unconstrained out-year production requirements across the
Future Year Defense Program (FYDP) to AETC. It is a HAF-level document from which PGLs
are developed. The PRD serves as a planning and programming document supporting
POM/APOM submissions, while PGLs serve as the training execution tasking. Establishes total
training requirements to AETC which will be used to assess future training capability. AETC
should use the PRD as a basis for establishing their funding priorities across the PPBE.
Program Technical Training (PTT)— AETC document reflecting training requirements by
Training Requester Quota Identifier (TRQI) and course.
Quota Management (QM)— The operation of swapping or moving scheduled quotas between
non-ADAF users or requesting use of another non-ADAF training user’s future scheduled
unfilled seats.
Quota Type— A two-character code within MilPDS/OTA used to indicate the student's active
duty status (i.e., Airman, officer, or civilian) and the travel funding status (i.e. AETC Centrally-
funded, unit-funded, or non-TDY).
Requirements— The documented number of graduates by user as identified on the EIS, OIS,
TDR, MRT, FT, DL or Linguist PGLs/PRDs.
 32                                                                AFI 36-2616 24 APRIL 2013


Resource Constraints— Deficiencies, such as money, facilities, time, manpower, and
equipment that preclude desired training from being delivered.
Sister Service/Other Agency Capacity— Limiting factor feeding into other capacity constraints
Specialty Training— Training process used to qualify airmen in their assigned specialty.
Sub-allocation— Allocation a program user has programmed a name against.
Supplemental Training— Formal AFS specific training (post IST) on new equipment, methods
or technology that are not suited for on-the-job training.
Training Detachment (TD)— AETC detachment that provides technical training, at an
operational location, on specific systems and aerospace ground equipment. A TD aims to qualify
personnel on new equipment or in new techniques and procedures, maintain proficiency and to
increase skill and knowledge, acquaint personnel with specific systems, and keep personnel
aware of changing concepts and requirements.
Training Device Capacity— Limited by training devices and/or equipment.
Training Facility Capacity— Limited only by training facilities.
Training Flow Management Working Group— Annual conference focused on refining EIS
training requirements while addressing course capacity, constraints and shortfalls.
Training Requester Quota Identifier (TRQI)— A four-character communication code within
OTA used to convey annual or supplemental training requirements, quota allocations, allocation
confirmations, and student-tracking information between a user of training and the provider
(owner) of training. TRQIs are assigned to MAJCOMS, FOAs, and DRUs to ensure training
accountability. Only one TRQI is assigned to a functional entity for MRTP.
