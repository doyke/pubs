2. These assets are required to support the explosives detector dog mission and are authorized
by AFCAT 21-209V2, Table 2.2., Demolition Munitions. According to HQ PACAF/A7SX, four

munitions are used for non-expendable training use only.

 NOTE: An abbreviated lot Number consists of the manufacture code and last one to three
 digits of the lot number (i.e. Lot MDV00L001-110 would be ―MDV110‖, or LC-1-7 would
 be ―LC7‖). An abbreviated WSN is the CRWC and the last three digits of the WSN. An
 abbreviated tail number is the last 4 of the aircraft tail number. For other than A assets in
 operating locations, use the actual condition code to prevent malposition indicators (in the
 previous example, the abbreviated lot would be ―MDV110 B‖).
