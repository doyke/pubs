2.9. Modification Change Processing. This instruction implements guidance contained in AFPD 10-6,
Mission Needs and Operational Requirements and in AFPD 10-9, Lead Operating Command Weapon
System Management. Within the CAF th ere are three entities that authorize configuration changes; the
CAF Requirements Oversight Council (CAFROC); the Software Configuration Control Sub-board
(SCCSB); and the Simulator Configuration Working Group (SCWG). The SCWG is subordinate to the
SCCSB and the SCCSB is subordinate to the CAFROC.
     2.9.1. CAFROC Membership and Responsibilities. The CAFROC is di vision chief leve l council
     chartered to conduct a comprehensive review of CAF mission needs.
     2.9.2. SCCSB Membership and Responsibilities. The ACC TRSS commander chairs the SCCSB.
     Membership includes representatives from the DO and DR branches and agencies with an interest in
     the proposed configuration change. The TRSS commander has command certification authority for all
     SCCSB approved configuration changes. The SCCSB reviews configuration changes that are out of
     scope of the TSSC, involve new training requirements, or require add itional funding. ACC TRSS/
     TSF will present to the CAFROC those configuration changes requiring command funding.
     2.9.3. SCWG Membership. The SCWG is composed of representatives from other CAF MAJCOMs
     (as appropriate), 29 TSS designated chairperson, unit operations, TRSS, unit project officers (POs)
     and/or quality assurance representatives (QARs), software support evaluators (SSEs), OL/Det chiefs,
     contractor personnel and others as required. Unit operations and TRSS personnel are voting members
     of the SCWG. All other SCWG members are advisors.
        2.9.3.1. If SCWG duties include courseware and its development or approval, formation of a sep-
        arate board, such as a Curriculum Review Board, is recommended. Thi s board will a ddress
        courseware and instruction issues only. The SCWG will identify the board membership and the
        approval authority for courseware changes. The SCWG will also establish pr ocedures for con-
        ducting board meetings including location and frequency. The SCWG w ill review the minutes
        from the courseware review board meeting.
        2.9.3.2. The SCCSB chairperson delegates command approval authority to the SCWG c hairper-
        son or TSS C Project Officer as app ropriate. This aut hority applies to changes wit hin the con-
        tracted level of effort which do not involve new training requirements nor require additional
        MAJCOM funding. New traini ng is those training tasks, which are not currently identified or
        approved for ATD training in the weapon system master training task list.
        2.9.3.3. Document modification requests on an AF Form 1067. The SCWG chairperson will
        assign a MAJCOM control number (see paragraph 2.9.6.) and accomplish the command certifica-
        tion. To certify a change on the AF Form 1067, enter in Block 22, "Certified as mission essential
        for reasons specified in Block 16." Send command certified copies of the AF Forms 1067 to the
        appropriate ASC or ALC weapon system program office. They in turn will present the Modifica-

     tion Proposal to the ASC or ALC Configuration Control Board (CCB). Changes to the product
     baseline require ASC o r ALC CCB approval. The TSSC contractor can develop and prototype
     changes pending ASC or ALC CCB approval. See Attachment 2 for the ATD modification pro-
     cess.
     2.9.3.4. Use of an AF Form 1067 for mission software, sensor, Digital Radar Land Mass System
     (DRLMS), visual, or radio aids updates is option al. The PO w ill submit these changes to th e
     TSSC contractor for development and incorporation when approved by the SCWG.
  2.9.4. SCWG Responsibilities:
     2.9.4.1. Initiate, review, and eva luate ATD modification proposals (using AF Form 1067), engi-
     neering feasibility studies, mission generation requirements, data base updates, and courseware
     updates if applicable.

                                      OPERATION AND USAGE

3.1. Scope. This chapter specifies the operation, use, reporting, and scheduling requirements for Aircrew
Training Devices (ATDs).

3.2. General Guidance. Unit commanders use ATDs as part of their training resources, aiding aircrews
to reach and maintain desired levels of proficiency in aircraft operations, emergency procedures, and mis-
sion accomplishment. ATDs complement training available in the aircraft. They provide training that is
prerequisite to inflight performance and training that cannot be fully conducted in flight due to range lim-
itations, safety, airspace, equipment, tactics, or security restrictions. The major command (MAJCOM)
11-series instructions and formal course syllabi specify the respective ATD training requirements. Local
commanders may tailor ATD training profiles to meet specific unit requirements. Commanders may also
require additional ATD events (e.g., predeployment instrument approaches at deployment bases, etc.).
Deletion of ATD requirements requires Headquarters Air Combat Command (HQ ACC) DO waiver.

3.3. Responsibilities of HQ ACC/DO, ACC TRSS, and CAF Units:
   3.3.1. HQ ACC/DO Responsibility. Establish aircrew training requirements for simulators includ-
   ing requirements for QUEEN BEE units.
   3.3.2. Respective ACC TRSS Units Responsibilities:
       3.3.2.1. Support formal course and operations unit training and development efforts as directed.
       3.3.2.2. Manage and approve courseware, develop criteria and evaluate academic instructors,
       evaluate methods of instruction, and perform oversight of other training issues.
       3.3.2.3. Develop and maintain the Training Task Lists (TTLs). The TTL identifies the training
       tasks and the specific performance level required for each task. The TRSS will review and update
       the TTL at least annually.
       3.3.2.4. Contract for and manage Instructor and/or Courseware Contracts.
   3.3.3. CAF Units Responsibility:
       3.3.3.1. Complete a thorough maintenance debrief after each training period and enter all discrep-
       ancies in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document. NOTE: The
       781 is the unit’s key to getting t he service they need s ince it is a major tool for identifying prob-
       lems to the support contractor for repair.
       3.3.3.2. Select an ATD project officer (PO) and, if requ ired, a quality assurance representative
       (QAR). See Chapter 4 for duties and responsibilities.
       3.3.3.3. CAF units will budget and fund for travel as necessary to obtain required ATD training.
       3.3.3.4. Negotiate ACC QUEEN BEE MOAs.
       3.3.3.5. Provide aircrews to support ATD testing as coordinated with applicable major commands
       (MAJCOMs).
       3.3.3.6. Maintain records of ATD usage.
14                                                                             AFI36-2248 1 MAY 1998

        3.3.3.7. Provide and maintain enough sets of a ircraft descriptions, performance technical orders,
        checklists, and appropriate flight publications for aircrew use.
        3.3.3.8. CAF units will select a Point of Contact (POC) and a System Administrator (SYS AD) or
        equivalents at those locations with unit level devices (UTDs, FMTs, etc.) which do not have a PO/
        QAR. The POC and SYS AD could be the same person. These individuals or their alternates
        must be available to ensure proper operation and maintenance of the unit’s simulators.
            3.3.3.8.1. The unit POC is the pr imary interface between the government and the repair con-
            tractor for support and maintenance of the assigned devices. D uties may include contacting
            the support contractor for needed repairs, providing diagnostic assistance to the contractor,
            notifying the 29 TSS when a failure occurs, performing other duties as defined by MAJCOM
            or the 29 TSS as appropriate.
            3.3.3.8.2. The unit SYS AD manages the clerical and administrative duties essential to
            achieving maximum training effectiveness. Duties include building new missions, backing up
            mission data, maintaining documentation, developing controls or passwords for ac cess to the
            simulator system, scheduling simulator time, maintaining monthly simulator utilization data,
            and performing other duties as defined by MAJCOM, 29 TSS, or the wing as appropriate.

3.4. Aircrew Training. Aircrew training objectives and ATD training requirements are specified in
applicable MAJCOM 11- series publications (to be c onverted to AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific series instruc-
tions).

3.5. Contracted Trainer Availability. Single-station and multi-station ATD availability is defined as the
hours provided to operations for scheduling IAW the applicable support contract. For Aircrew Training
System (ATS) type contracts, availability is defined IAW the applicable contract or as specified to fulfill
the required student throughput plus government use time.

3.6. Scheduling Responsibilities. The operations group commander (OG/CC) will specify the office
responsible for sche duling ATD usage. The c ontractor responsible for instruction in ATS contracts will
identify, IAW with the applicable contract, aircrew training and simulator availability requirements to the
appropriate agency. The unit scheduling office will do the following.
     3.6.1. Publish training schedules IAW applicable directives. QUEEN BEE supported units will
     establish procedures for reporting monthly training requirements to the QUEEN BEE unit in sufficient
     time for incorporation into the ATD schedule.
     3.6.2. Provide training schedules to the contractor IAW the ATD support contract. Schedules will
     identify either the mission scenario or mission critical systems and subsystems required. Coordinate
     any changes to the published schedule IAW the applicable support contract. The unit ATD PO will act
     as the liaison between the scheduling office and the contractor.
        3.6.2.1. If ATD instruction is contracted for (either by ATS or by "instruction only" contracts) the
        contractor must identify the aircrew members requiring training and the mission requir ements
        IAW the applicable contract. The scheduling officer will schedule government use time IAW the
        applicable contract and paragraph 3.6.2. above.
AFI36-2248 1 MAY 1998                                                                                    15

   3.6.3. Use the following recommended priorities for ATD scheduling (unless otherwise specified by
   ACC TRSS/TSF or other CAF MAJCOM, as appropriate). Unit commanders should adjust priorities
   in light of operational requirements.
       3.6.3.1. Aircraft accident investigation and research of flight safety items.
       3.6.3.2. Simulator certification (SIMCERT).
       3.6.3.3. ATD modification testing.
       3.6.3.4. Formal syllabus training, initial qualification training.
       3.6.3.5. Standardization and evaluation checks.
       3.6.3.6. Continuation training, including QUEEN BEE units.
       3.6.3.7. Other aircrew training (i.e., new missions, operational readiness inspection preparation,
       mission rehearsal).
       3.6.3.8. Threat simulator validation program.
       3.6.3.9. Non-aircrew training (i.e., field training, detachme nt training, engine run t raining, air
       traffic controller orientation, TSSC and OL/Det personnel, PO training).
       3.6.3.10. Other (i.e., distinguished visitors, contractor visits, tours).
   3.6.4. Annotate deviations f rom scheduled activities on appropriate MAJCOM, Air National Guar d
   (ANG), or Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) forms. Deviations are listed below.
       3.6.4.1. No Show. Designate as a "no show" any aircrew member who does not report at the train-
       ing device within 15 minutes after the scheduled start time.
       3.6.4.2. Cancellation. Cancel scheduled missions when approved by the squadron commander or
       designated representative and coordinated with the unit scheduler. The unit scheduler will notify
       the ATD PO of cancellations. Instances involving safety of p ersonnel or alert response do not
       require prior approval.
       3.6.4.3. Abort. Abort a training session when trainer serviceability is insufficient to complete the
       scheduled training. The instructor can then exercise options available as discussed in the applica-
       ble support contract.
       3.6.4.4. Other. Deviations as a result of weather, electrical failure, environmental system failure,
       higher headquarters directed exercises, alert response, etc., will be nonchargeable deviations.

3.7. Recording Aircrew Training Device (ATD) Usage. Document ATD usage on AFTO Form 781.
Responsible HQ ACC organizations may waive AFTO 781 reporting of mission simulator time for their
respective units.

3.8. Reporting Procedures. MAJCOM, AETC, ANG, and AFRC units will report training system gains
and losses IAW AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting. CAF POs will sub-
mit contractor evaluations and other documentation as required by the administrative contract officer. In
addition, units will submit reports, as directed, to 29 TSS with an information copy to ACC TRS S/TSF,
not later than 10 calendar days after the close-out of the report period. The PO will certify the contractor
field service report and complete the AF Form 4026, Aircrew Training Devices Utilization (replaces
MC Form 80). Th e PO will resolve disagreements as detaile d in the contract a nd enter a note in th e
16                                                                              AFI36-2248 1 MAY 1998

remarks section of both reports. Each CAF unit will submit an A F Form 4026 or equival ent utilization
reports to the 29 TSS, with an information copy to ACC TRSS/TSF and respective MAJCOM, not later
than 10 calendar days after the close-out of the report period.

3.9. Instructions for Preparing AF Form 4026, Aircrew Training Devices Utilization (RCS:
HAF-XOO (M) 9804) (Replaces MC Form 80):
     3.9.1. General Instructions:
        3.9.1.1. Prepare and submit Aircrew Training Devices Utilization Reports for al l ATDs. Send
        reports for the preceding month to the 29 TSS with information copies to ACC TRSS/TSF and the
        appropriate AFMC organization not later than 10 calendar days following the end of the reported
        month. Continue reporting during emergency conditions, delayed precedence.
        3.9.1.2. Make a separate complete line entry for each device.
        3.9.1.3. Consider multi-station ATDs as one device. Report availability and utilization any time
        any or all of the stations are available or used. NOTE: This is a change in reporting procedures.
        3.9.1.4. For ATDs with multi-stations, indicate under "Note" t he hours scheduled and utilized
        with all stations operating for an integrated mission.
     3.9.2. Specific Instructions:
        3.9.2.1. Column A--Trainer Type and Serial Number. Enter each device on a separate line.
        Enter additional lines for each unit not aligned to the host wing (QUEEN BEE, ANG, etc.) that
        accomplished training. Report special activity as a separate line item. Special activity is any,
        which does not directly support 11- series training requirements (e.g., mission generation, engine
        run training, software development, tours, etc.). Explain the type of special activity in the remarks
        block. NOTE: Multiple line entries reported on one device require a total entry.
        3.9.2.2. Column B--Contracted Hours Available. This column reflects the hours available for
        Air Force use according to the applicable support contract. Subtract those hours from the con-
        tracted available time for any activity, which renders the ATD unavailable for government use.
        This could include modifications to the device or other pre-planned activities. Identify reasons in
        the remarks block. Do not include federal holidays in the available hours.
        3.9.2.3. Column C-- Do not use this column.
        3.9.2.4. Column D--Hours Scheduled. This colum n reflects the total number of hours a tr ain-
        ing device was scheduled during the month. This will include aircrew training, QUEEN BEE, and
        special activities. Make a separa te line entry for ea ch type of us age. Addit ions to the weekly

   Code (TVC) for each training event that the new or modified device meets. Additionally, if the ATD
   is to be used for MAJCOM 11-series flying training events, each event must receive a Training Value
   Code (TVC) 1 to be creditable. Software block updates and hardware modifications will normally be
   initially certified on the first representative ATD installation after Air Force acceptance testing is com-
   plete. Certification of subsequent devices receiving the exact same modification may be conducted by
   the units or by the 29 TSS, depending on the complexity of the modification and the previous certifi-
   cation results, as approve d by the 29 TSS. All ot her initial SIMCERTs will be conducted by the 29
   TSS SIMCERT team or 29 TSS designated augmentees.
   5.5.2. Recurring Certification. Recurring certification ensures the training device continues to per-
   form to the initial cer tification standards. Annual recur ring certification is on a calendar year cycle
   IAW the MAJCOM approved master schedule and the appropriate master plan.
   5.5.3. Decertification. Assignment of a TVC of 4 decer tifies that event for aircrew trai ning until
   correction of the discrepancy. SIMCERT personnel will then recertify that event. Decertification
   consists of de leting training tasks from the list of ta sks for which the training device ha s been certi-
   fied.
   5.5.4. Recertification. Rece rtification consists of testing of the decertified tasks and any oth er
   affected tasks. The 29 TSS or the local unit, per directions provided by the 29 TSS, will reinstate the
   decertified events.
   5.5.5. SIMCERT Reports. Reports should follow the format contained in the appropriate SIM-
   CERT Master Plan.
