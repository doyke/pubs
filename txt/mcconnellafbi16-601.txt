        support operations to include HUMINT, OPSEC, and local security concerns for newly
        assigned ACC members, escorts, baggage team, EMT, and transportation drivers.
        1.3.5.6. Local escorts have two primary responsibilities: (1) the protection and safety of
        visiting parties and (2) the security of site facilities. Escorts should be knowledgeable to
        facilitate movements to and from scheduled activities, flightline, medical and dining
        facilities and other on and off-base locations.
        1.3.5.7. Should any foreign member indicate their desire to defect to an Air Force
        representative, the escort will immediately contact CCT. The DTRA Team Chief, as
        senior representative will take actions as appropriate.
1.4. Mass Aircraft Parking Area (MAPA).

     has been doing this.
     1.4.2. CCT will coordinate with SFS to cordon off Open Skies parking as a controlled area.
     Visiting OST aircraft are not considered PL assets and will not be protected according to
     those procedures. SFS will monitor the Open Skies parking area for unauthorized
     movements.
     1.4.3. Arms Control controlled area badges will be used for entry/access into B1120 (e.g.,
     Open Skies, CWC, etc). Restricted area badges and entry controlled points will not be
     displayed due to OPSEC countermeasure.
MCCONNELLAFBI16-601 3 SEPTEMBER 2013                                                              7


   1.4.4. Flightline support equipment will be staged on Delta ramp parallel with the blast
   fence.
1.5. Photography Policy
   1.5.1. Open Skies Policy outlines treaty accommodations for photography under all
   international treaties and agreements. This policy is designed to address photography
   primarily during aircraft inspections at U.S. Air Force airfields hosting OST observation
   missions. Specifically, it covers the foreign teams taking photography of the U.S. inspection
   of their aircraft and for the U.S. team (from DTRA) to record the inspection process for the
   foreign teams, if so requested by the foreign team.
   1.5.2. CCT will brief local flightline photography rules to Observing Parties, DTRA, and
   other observers to ensure compliance. Local escorts will inform TCO on any violations to
   local procedures. CCT will contact the DTRA Team Chief for resolution. Note: At no time
   should personal property be confiscated or involuntary taken from the observing Party.
   Observing Party members are afforded limited diplomatic immunity, including the
   inviolability of their person and personal property. This means that to touch them or their
   personal property may violate their treaty rights.
   1.5.3. It is McConnell AFB policy that photography of the foreign observation aircraft
   (Russian Tu-154m/214) during technical inspection is permitted, but photography of any
   other aircraft, flightline structures and related activities is prohibited. Photographs should be
   oriented and framed to ensure only the intended image is taken.
   1.5.4. CCT must pre-coordinate with the DTRA Team Chief for authorization to take photos
   of all treaty activities to document compliance, historical data points and inclusion into base
   compliance plans. Note: Uncoordinated or unapproved photography of the foreign team and
   aircraft may become a diplomatic issue and will be avoided. Photography will be carefully
   managed.
   1.5.5. CCT is authorized by Public Affairs to validate and sign photography requests
   involving facilities and flightline. CCT will coordinate photography entry EALs with 22
   ARW/PA and 22 SFS for authentication and information only.

                                             Chapter 2

                                 NEW START TREATY (NST)

2.1. Tasking Order. McConnell AFB is tasked by TACC/XOOOD to provide MILAIR support
for 1A3 priority taskings. 22 OSS will reference MOA between HQ AMC/DA3 and DTRA/OP-
OSS, Agreement on Treaty Airlift Requirement Issues.
     2.1.1. KC-135 RT aircraft is highly discouraged due to the unique mission capabilities.
     Access to the interior of the aircraft could provide insight to design and capabilities not
     otherwise available.
     2.1.2. DAMA SATCOM or ROBE equipped KC-135 aircraft is discouraged due to the
     possibility of revealing specific communication capabilities or equipment. If unable to utilize
     a non-DAMA equipped aircraft, the aircrew must make every effort to mask/curtain/cover
     the equipment.
2.2. Rules of Engagement. 22 OSS/OSO will ensure Current Operations Plans (OSS/OSOK)
accomplish checklist actions as primary POC for New START mission origination.
     2.2.1. 22 OSS/OSOK, Mission Planning Cell will ensure NST mission profile complies with
     MOA between HQ AMC/DA3, Deputy Director of Operations and DTRA/OP-OSS, Chief
     New START Nuclear Division guidance.
     2.2.2. Aircrews will position to the Point of Entry (POE) in order to be legal for alert (LFA)
     no later than 4-hours after arrival of Russian NST teams. Note: This allows time to get a
     crew into crew-rest, alerted, briefed, positioned to the POE and crew-rested before the LFA.
     2.2.3. Tasked squadron has approximately 36 hours from initial NST Voice Format 01
     notification to LFA at POE.
     2.2.4. Normal NST missions will use “basic aircrew plus passenger monitor.” Aircrews will
     be augmented for sequential inspections, as necessary when DTRA Team Chiefs notify
     TACC of the requirement, via DTRA Ops Center, to accommodate anticipated extended duty
     day operations due to travel flight times and inspection activity duration requirements.
     2.2.5. Primary aircraft will be KC-135 “Slick jet” configured with a minimum of 20 floor
     mounted airline seats and 2 tables (Capstone-DV-START configuration maintained by 22
     OG/OGV). If KC-135 is not available, secondary aircraft used will be determined on “as
     available basis” necessary to meet treaty timelines.
     2.2.6. Aircrews will re-confirm NST mission take-off times with the DTRA Team Chief.
     Note:    DTRA Team Chief coordinates with DTRA Operations Center and 618
     TACC/XOOOD to determine NST mission take-off times.
2.3. 22 OSS/OSOK will create and plan New START missions. Coordinates with MOC to
ensure KC-135 “slick jet” configuration is used. Conducts aircrew mission briefings with
AFOSI. Briefs aircrew NLT 4-hr prior to take-off on NST mission requirements to include
AFOSI special interest items and ensures no COMSEC materials are issued. Submits After
Action Report (AAR) to CCT within three duty days upon mission completion.

                                           Chapter 3

                                 TREATY ON OPEN SKIES

3.1. 22 ARW Open Skies Base Compliance Plan (CPLAN), Annex A. 22 ARW/CCT will
ensure base agencies execute host base support operations (to include CWC on-site preparations)
upon notification of an arms control event.
3.2. Strict adherence. 22 ARW must comply with Open Skies Treaty (OST) requirements.
Base agencies must be prepared to execute short notice taskings, as little as 24-36 hours prior to
an event.
3.3. Logistical Support. Base agencies will implement 22 ARW OST CPLAN to ensure
compliance with all timelines. Inability to facilitate ground support actions that cause the
mission to deviate from those timelines can result in violations of the Treaty, creating a
diplomatic challenge.
3.4. Rules of Engagement. Base agencies will execute host base support procedures, escort
requirements, notifications and reports, airfield management, aircraft servicing/refueling,
maintenance support, weather briefings support, physical security, photography policy, billeting
and transportation requirements, protocol and public affairs guidance (PAG).
3.5. Work center Checklists. Each support agency will develop base work center checklists to
be included as an attachment to the plan.
3.6. Components of a Compliance Plan;
   3.6.1. 22 FSS will prepare Air Capital Inn (B202, B196) or use off-base lodging, dining
   (flight meals and dining in), facility support (B1120 or B412) and mortuary services.
   Lodging, dining and facility support arrangements will need to be planned in advance. 22
   MSG/CC or designated representative will distribute notification letters to occupants of Air
   Capital Inn or RJDCC customers on the potential to reschedule or cancel events held in
   Signatures, Heritage, Derby, Kansas, Wichita, Refueler and Storm Cellar conference rooms.
   3.6.2. 22 SFS will oversee high and low threat security procedures for escorts, force
   protection, inspector entry into controlled areas, OPSEC and COMSEC. It is highly
   recommended 22 ARW/AT stand down/alter wing-wide random access measures during on-
   site arms control visits. NOTE: Foreign nationals/inspectors must not view our normal
   security procedures.
   3.6.3. 22 MDG will ensure arrangements for emergency/non-elective medical treatment of
   mission team members. Note: DTRA is responsible for the cost of all medical treatments
   and is billed accordingly.
   3.6.4. 22 CS will provide support for public address systems (PA) support for
   ceremonies/briefings, Land Mobile Radio (LMR) with dedicated net frequency, dedicated
   CLASS C land lines for foreign nationals to contact their embassies (Leased Comm.), and
   NIPRNET computers (Comm Focal Point) support for DTRA members or other treaty-
   specific items.
   3.6.5. 22 LRS will provide transportation requirements, equipment/baggage handling to
   include special handling instructions for inspection equipment. CCT will attempt to
10                                        MCCONNELLAFBI16-601 3 SEPTEMBER 2013


  accommodate DTRA Team Chief’s request for transportation support for off-base and
  cultural activities within existing guidelines/restrictions.
  3.6.6. 22 ARW/PA will consult with SAF/PA, DTRA/PA and OASD (PA) guidance on
  affected treaty requirements. Clearly established ground rules on control of media movement
  and actions are necessary to prevent interference with inspections. In accordance with 2005
  OASD (PA) guidance, the DoD PA posture is “passive, response to inquiry only.” PA can
  respond to inquiries, but not actively promote activities. There are no restrictions placed on
  articles for the base newspaper or social media outlets regarding the OST mission or an
  activity in progress, or has recently happened.
  3.6.7. 22 ARW/CCP will consult with CCT for specific requirements. By Air Force
  definition, the foreign OST mission team members are afforded the rights and privileges of
  DVs under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.
  3.6.8. 22 AMXS will provide aircraft servicing and maintenance support. This includes, but
  not limited to refueling, gaseous oxygen, nitrogen, de-icing, ground equipment, power carts,
  air stairs, water, and latrine servicing.
  3.6.9. CCT will ensure affected base participants are knowledgeable in host base support
  operations to include; HUMINT, OPSEC, medical emergencies, and defection techniques. In
  addition, will work with Transportation, AAFES Base Exchange, Commissary, Recreational
  Services and affected civilian establishments to ensure DTRA leisure activity expectations
  are met.
  3.6.10. Operational Security (OPSEC)
     3.6.10.1. Base personnel will employ OPSEC principles to reduce the vulnerability
     towards adversary collection and exploitation of critical information. OPSEC applies to
     all activities that prepare, sustain, or employ forces during all phases of operations. (AFI
     10-701).
     3.6.10.2. Base personnel must be observant and diligent in protecting information that
     might compromise our security, while at the same time being courteous and pleasant.
     3.6.10.3. If inquiries or actions of a foreign observation team member raise suspicions,
     the host-unit escort will notify CCT, who will in turn notify the DTRA Team Chief. CCT
     will notify 22 SFS representatives of any suspect situations.
