                         NOMINATION AND SELECTION PROCEDURES

1.1. ANG CE Awards. The Air National Guard Civil Engineer (ANG CE) annually recognizes CE orga-
nizations and personnel for outstanding achievement. These units and individuals are then forwarded to
compete for recognition at the AF level. Several AF level awards include categories that are specifically
for air reserve component (ARC) nominees. These awards will be highlighted in this document for special
emphasis. This document does not replace AFI 36-2817 but supplements it and clarifies it’s applicability
to the ANG.

1.2. General Nominating Procedures:
   1.2.1. Organizations that have installations, units, groups, squadrons, flights, teams or individuals eli-
   gible for awards may submit one nomination for each award category. Military in all statuses are eli-
   gible - traditional, technician, Active Guard and Reserve (AGR), and statutory tour. Department of
   Defense (DoD) civilians and state employees may be nominated for all awards, if eligible. Contrac-
   tors, as outlined in DoD 1400.25-M, Defense Logistics Management System (DLMS), Subchapter
   451, Section ‘O’, “Contractors,” are not eligible for any awards pertaining to this instruction. For unit
   and individual awards, the previous year’s winner is not eligible in the current year competition. This
   restriction does not apply to Design Awards and Environmental Awards.
   1.2.2. Award nomination formats and criteria are as outlined in AFI 36-2817. Additional guidance on
   completing your nomination is as follows:
       1.2.2.1. The indicated headings for each award must be included in the text. Place each heading
       on a separate line, flush left, using upper and lower case, bold face type, with no period or colon at
       the end of the line. Headings may be shortened or combined, as deemed appropriate.
       1.2.2.2. Use bullet statement format. Start each bullet with a hyphen symbol, followed by a single
       space. Begin the text of each bullet with a capital letter. Use no punctuation (period, etc.) at the
       end of the bullet. If a bullet carries over to a second line, start the second line flush left, under the
       hyphen symbol for the line above. Be sure each bullet is placed under the appropriate heading.
       1.2.2.3. Factual information, supported by appropriate examples and statistics, is most effective.
       Avoid the use of "glittering generalities" that attempt to make up for a lack of factual information.
       1.2.2.4. For optimum results, use all lines of the IMT. Blank lines imply either weak justification
       or lack of diligence in preparation thereby diminishing the effectiveness of the nomination. Use
       active voice and strong verbs, rather than excessive adjectives, to convey what was done and its
       effects. Be specific. Describe clearly and in detail what the nominee did and the actual results.
   1.2.3. Submittal requirements for all ANG nominations are outlined in ANGI 36-2802, Air National
   Guard Special Awards and Trophies. No unit is authorized to submit nomination packages directly to
   the Air Force or AF agencies. The staffing process at ANG takes time so the deadlines for submittal to
   ANG will be several weeks prior to the deadlines listed in AFI 36-2817 and the AF call letter.
   1.2.4. Per the requirements in ANGI 36-2802, the Adjutant General of the state must sign the trans-
   mittal letter for each respective nomination package competing for an AF level award.
6                                                                          ANGI36-2803 17 MAY 2004


    1.2.5. Send the original transmittal letter, with the nomination packages, to ANG Director Diversity,
    Personnel and Training, Personnel Force Management, Customer Operations Section (ANG/DPFOC),
    1411 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202 and electronically to the e-mail address provided
    in the call letter. The one exception is the Design Awards, which must be submitted electronically to
    Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE) per Chapter 4 of this instruction. You may
    submit multiple nominations in the same major program under one letter. The four major programs are
    Unit and Individual Awards, Design Awards, Environmental Awards and Fire and Emergency Ser-
    vices Awards.

        met, uniqueness of the design solution, compatibility with other facilities on the installation, the
        sustainable aspects of the design, and composite integration of architectural, engineering, interior
        design, and landscape design, and construction execution, as applicable. Do not enter any facility
        if the final construction cost exceeds the programmed amount (PA). This will be verified by ANG/
