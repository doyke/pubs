302AWI21-101 19 MAY 2004                                                                                3


   3.4. QA is responsible for coordinating the security of impounded equipment and related records with
   MOC and the responsible maintenance work center. Work centers will obtain clearance from the IO to
   access and perform maintenance on impounded aircraft. The QA Superintendent or designated repre-
   sentative and Production Superintendent (MXOOC) will coordinate to determine whether mainte-
   nance may be performed on the impounded aircraft/equipment.
   3.5. The QA Superintendent or designee is the single point of contact (POC) for impounded aircraft
   or equipment.
   3.6. The Aircraft Maintenance Squadron Commander (AMXS/CC) or designated maintenance officer
   will closely monitor all situations involving aircraft/ equipment impoundments.
   3.7. Copies of all letters designating authority for impoundment responsibilities will be on file in QA
   and in the MOC.

4. Procedures.
   4.1. Whenever impoundment occurs, regardless of the reason, the following actions are required:
      4.1.1. MOC is immediately notified of the conditions warranting impoundment. MOC will then
      notify the following individuals and wing staff agencies:
          4.1.1.1. MXG/CC.
          4.1.1.2. Production Superintendent.
          4.1.1.3. AMXS/CC.
          4.1.1.4. MXG/QA,
          4.1.1.5. AMXS/MXA.
          4.1.1.6. AW/CC.
          4.1.1.7. Command Post (AW/CP).
          4.1.1.8. Security Forces Squadron (SFS), if sabotage or tampering is suspected; Maintenance
          Operations Center (MOC) provides information as required In Accordance With (IAW) 302
          AWI 31-102, Tampering or Suspected Damage to Aircraft.
          4.1.1.9. AW/SE (IO for safety-related mishaps).
      4.1.2. The decision to impound aircraft/equipment is made by the AW/CC, MXG/CC, OG/CC or
      designated representative, who then becomes the Impoundment Authority of record for documen-
      tation purposes.
      4.1.3. The aircraft is impounded by entering a Red X in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance
      Discrepancy and Work Document, stating that the aircraft is impounded as directed by the
      Impoundment Authority (or IAW this instruction, if no IA can be reached). Include the reason for
      impoundment and a reference to the condition requiring impoundment (page and item number of
      related discrepancy). Use Job Control Numbers starting with the Julian date and ending with 8494
      through 8499.
      4.1.4. When an aircraft is impounded for AFI 91-204 procedures, the cockpit voice recorder
      (CVR) is removed and impounded as well. The CVR is removed as soon as possible and secured
      in the Maintenance Group Quality Assurance (MXG/QA) office or MOC, where custody is relin-
4                                                                         302AWI21-101 19 MAY 2004


       quished only to an authorized IO. The Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) may also be removed
       if so directed by the IO. The Maintenance Information System (G081) files for the related aircraft/
       equipment will be “locked” by MOC or the Maintenance Data Systems Analyst (MDSA).
       4.1.5. The aircraft will be secured in its recovered state to preserve evidence. Propellers may be
       positioned with the number one blade in the twelve o’clock position and taken “out-of-feather”
       during periods of cold weather if, in the opinion of the IA, it would not interfere with the subse-
       quent investigation.
       4.1.6. The MXG/CC (or OG/CC, in the case of an airdrop malfunction) will assign an IO to man-
       age the impounded aircraft/equipment (typically, the 731 Airlift Squadron (AS) Tactics Officer for
       airdrop malfunctions and QA for all others). Enter the name of the IO in the impoundment entry
       discrepancy block of the AFTO Form 781A or in the appropriate equipment form. OGV and AW/
       SE will work closely with QA when assigned IO duties.
       4.1.7. Impounded aircraft/equipment records are closely controlled by the IO, who provides lim-
       ited access IAW applicable directives.

5. After Normal Duty Hours.
    5.1. The Night Shift supervisor or designated representative will ensure the intent of this AWI is met
    to the maximum extent possible. The aircraft will be secured and a boxcar seal placed on the crew
    entrance door. The seal number will be written in ink in the AFTO Form 781A impoundment entry
    discrepancy block and the aircraft forms placed inside the aircraft prior to the seal installation. Only
    the assigned IO may remove this seal.

6. Flight Control Malfunctions.
    6.1. Special attention will be given to flight control malfunctions. 302 MXG will use the “Blue Chip”
    Team concept to troubleshoot and repair these type malfunctions. As a minimum, the following guide-
    lines will be followed when discrepancies involving primary and secondary flight controls are
    reported:
       6.1.1. Each work center involved in the troubleshooting and repair of flight control malfunctions
       will assign the most highly qualified personnel to the “Blue Chip” Team. Make every effort to
       keep the same personnel assigned until the malfunction is corrected.
       6.1.2. Minimum team member qualification must be a 7-skill/journeyman-level technician from
       each affected work center, plus an IO from QA.
       6.1.3. Applicable job guides, technical data and directives will be utilized for all phases of work
       and will be documented as completed. Each work center will enter its portion of the trouble-shoot-
       ing as a separate entry for each aspect of both troubleshooting and repair phases. The Team Chief,
       as designated by the Maintenance Superintendent/designated representative, will clear the original
       discrepancy (Red X).
       6.1.4. The following situations require the Flight Superintendent/designated representative of the
       applicable work center having primary responsibility for the discrepancy to clear the Red X:
           6.1.4.1. Uncommanded flight control inputs reportable IAW AFI 91-204.
           6.1.4.2. Flight control problems occurring in the “direct manual” mode
302AWI21-101 19 MAY 2004                                                                                 5


          6.1.4.3. Flight control problems occurring when the “auto” mode fails to disengage.
       6.1.5. Only the MXG/CC or designated representative will be the releasing authority for the
       impoundment.

7. Lost Tool Notification.
   7.1. If a tool is discovered missing after an aircraft has taxied or is airborne, MOC will notify AW/CP
   of the possibility of the lost tool being onboard the aircraft. Information concerning the lost tool and
   its probable location will be relayed to the crew as soon as possible. If the aircraft is still on the
   ground, it will remain on the ground until the tool is accounted for. If airborne, consideration should
   be given to landing as soon as possible, preferably at home station.

8. Airdrop Malfunctions.
   8.1. Airdrop malfunctions will be investigated by 731 AS/DOXT (Tactics) and/or a designated joint
   airdrop inspection (JAI)-qualified loadmaster using procedures in Air Force Joint Instruction (AFJI)
   13-210, Joint Airdrop Inspection Records, Malfunction Investigations, and Activity Reporting AFRC
   Sup 1 and AFI 11-2C-130, V3, Ch10/302 AW Sup 1. The IO assigned to investigate airdrop malfunc-
   tions will verbally release the aircraft from impoundment to the Maintenance Squadron Quality
   (MXQ) Superintendent or designee as soon as a determination has been made concerning the mishap
   cause. The IO will also contact the 39 Aerial Port Squadron (APS) for disposition of airdrop equip-
   ment still onboard the aircraft.

9. Reporting Requirements.
   9.1. QA will use the Quality Assurance Tracking and Trend Analysis System (QANTTAS) to report
   all impoundment activities/actions.
   9.2. QA will report all incidents of multiple-engine power loss to AW/SE as a High Accident Poten-
   tial (HAP) report. The report will include specific values of RPM, torque, fuel flow, TIT and other
   related power plant indications.
   9.3. 731 Airlift Squadron Operation Office (AS/DOXT) will report Airdrop Malfunctions IAW pro-
   cedures outlined in AFJI 13-210, AFRC Sup 1 and AFI 11-2C-130, V3, Ch10/302 AW Sup 1.
