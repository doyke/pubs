9. 10. Reusable Container Program Implementation Guidance.
      9.10.1. Squadron Commanders are accountable for the effectiveness of the Reusable
      Container Program, ensuring that all aspects of the program are in line with current AFIs,
      plus ensuring accountability of containers and understanding that their unit will be
      required to reimburse the 28 LRS if the proper container is not turned in with the
      property being shipped. This includes but is not limited to reimbursement and transfer of
      funds from host/tenant units for packaging services; lost, destroyed or discarded Fast
      Packs, standard packs, SPI shipping containers or packaging materials; labor hours for
      constructing or replacing SPI containers and commercial transportation (shipping and
      handling) costs. This gives the 28th Bomb Wing direct control over the program and
      accountability.
         9.10.1.1. The BCM will be appointed from 28 LRS.
         9.10.1.1.1. 28th Logistics Readiness Squadron Deployment & Distribution Flight,
         (28 LRS/LGRD), and the 28th Logistics Readiness Squadron Cargo Movement
         Element (28 LRS/LGRDDC) will establish procedures for control, recovery and re-
         use of reusable containers, packaging materials, reimbursement or prior transfer of
         funds for packaging costs.
         9.10.1.1.2. Unit commanders appointment letters (if required because the unit
         possesses 3 or more reusable containers) will contain the signature of primary and
         alternate UCM to ensure AF Forms 451, Request for Packaging Service are only
         signed by primary/alternate UCM or the unit commander. If primary/alternate
         representatives are deployed at the same time new representatives will be appointed.
         9.10.1.1.2.1. (Added) Units will forward an updated Reusable Container Program
         (RCP) monitor appointment letter signed by the unit commander to 28
         LRS/LGRDDC, within 10 days of any changes.
         9.10.1.1.2.2. (Added) Unit Commanders must establish a reusable container
         program that allows 28 LRS/LGRDDC to perform monitoring oversight ensuring
         accountability, reuse, and reimbursements.
         9.10.1.1.2.3. (Added) Unit Commanders will Identify and maintain a storage area
         within their squadron for reusable containers. This area must be covered, clean, and
         dry to protect reusable containers and packaging materials from inclement weather.
         9.10.1.1.2.4. (Added) Unit Commanders will ensure that designated UCM attend
         training within 2 weeks of appointment.
         9.10.1.1.2.5. (Added) Unit Commanders will ensure UCM’s attend the Reusable
         Container Program meetings and/or other necessary meetings as required.
       9.10.1.2.5. If a reusable container is turned in as excess and not redistributed, it will
       become part of the Cargo Movement Element bench stock. These containers will be
       made available for use by unit monitors if/when required. NOTE: This will not be
       considered courtesy storage and these containers may be shipped, reissued, or reused at
       the discretion of 28 LRS/LGRDDC.

     9.10.1.2.6. To measure programs effectiveness, AF Forms 451 will be annotated when
     the item is received without proper container, SPI, etc., and annotate the date the item is
     packaged.
     9.10.1.3.4. Cargo Movement will maintain a list of unit RCP managers and alternates
     authorized to sign AF Form 451. Ensure that copies of SF 364, Report of Discrepancy
     and AF Forms 451 are kept with the container if the item is in the wrong container. The
     BCM will forward all AF Forms 451 with all costs of packing to 28th Logistics
     Readiness Squadron Resource Adviser (28 LRS/LGLOR). NOTE: beginning FY09 28
     LRS will forward quarterly reports to the 28th Mission Support Group for payment of all
     AF Forms 451. Beginning FY10, all units participating in the Base Reusable Container
     Program will be billed directly by 28 LRS. The 28 LRS/RA will forward all quarterly
     reports to the unit RAs. Packaging services costs will be reimbursed to 28 LRS,
     Deployment & Distribution Flight, Cargo Movement account for replacement of
     reusable containers. Unit Commanders will be notified on a monthly basis of the status
     of AF Forms 451, and collection action will begin on a quarterly basis, effective 1 Oct
     2009.
     9.10.1.3.6. The designated BCM from 28 LRS will chair the meeting of the Reusable
     Container Council working group meeting on a quarterly basis. The working group will
     consist of representatives from the major base shipping activities; i.e. 28 LRS, 28th
     Maintenance Squadron, 28th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron and any other
     organizations that possess 3 or more reusable containers. The objective of the working
     group will be to review operational requirements, evaluate number of containers lost or
     destroyed, replacement cost, and address negligence and deficiencies that exists, and
     recommend corrective action for an effective program.
     9.10.1.4.2. 28th Logistics Readiness Squadron Deployment & Distribution Flight, 28
     LRS/LGRDDC will perform semi-annual inspections of organizational units’ reusable
     container storage areas and their program. A semi-annual report will be prepared,
     identifying units that fail to comply with AFI 24-203 and this supplement.
       9.10.1.4.2.1. Prepare a monthly Reusable Container Use/Replacement Cost Analysis
       Report, indicating favorable trends regarding the management of the program. This
       report will be forwarded to applicable unit commanders for information, trends, and
       necessary corrective action.
       9.10.1.4.2.4. Conduct an initial on-site inspection of reusable container storage area(s)
       and provide additional inspections when necessary.
