(354FW) This publication does not apply to the Air National Guard or US Air Force Reserve units and
members.
(354FW) AFI 32-6001, Family Housing Management, 21 August 2006, is supplemented as follows. It
provides guidance for establishing and operating a government controlled family housing program and
lists designated key and mission essential positions. Records Disposition: Documentation created in

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This interim change implements new guidelines that (1) require installations to maintain HCP and HRMA
results in ACES and to submit FH occupancy and utilization reports quarterly through the MAJCOMs, (2)
revise and clarify mold policy to refer occupants with health complaints related to family housing (vice
environmental hazards) to their medical provider and request a follow-up health risk assessment as deter-
mined appropriate by the Bioenvironmental Engineer, (3) give priority placement to members deployed
on an Unaccompanied Dependent Restricted (UDR) tour to CENTCOM AOR for a consecutive 365 days
and scheduled to PCS within 60 days of their return and (4) change the Basic Allowance for Housing
(BAH) reconciliation from an annual to a quarterly requirement. A bar ( | ) indicates a revision from the
previous edition.
(354FW) This supplement has been revised to reflect commander directed changes to designated key and
mission essential positions for which incumbents will be required to reside on Eielson Air Force Base as
a matter of military necessity and/or operational requirements. A ( | ) indicates a revision from the pre-
vious edition. The 354 Fighter Wing Commander may waive the requirement for incumbents of these
positions to reside on base.

                                         POLICY – GENERAL

2.1. Family Housing (FH) Policy Overview. Rely on the community first to provide adequate and
affordable FH. When a shortage of housing exists in the community, as determined by the HRMA, pro-
vide adequate government housing, giving priority to personnel who must live on the installation for mil-
itary necessity. Use 98 percent as a goal for measuring occupancy of existing assets and determine
management actions when occupancy fails to meet that goal. Mandatory housing is allowed only in for-
eign OCONUS locations under certain conditions (paragraph 4.7.). Note: The terms dependent and fam-
ily member are synonymous.

2.2. Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). The SOFA between the United States and foreign govern-
ments takes precedence over AF housing policy.

2.3. Equal Opportunity in Housing. Provide FH to eligible personnel of all Services without regard to
race, color, religion, sex, familial status, handicap or national origin.

2.4. Leasing and Subleasing. Leasing or subleasing of FH is not authorized (Comptroller General (CG)
Decision B-140917 and 39 CG Decision 401).

2.5. Independent Duty (ID) Personnel. The Air Force provides housing for ID personnel on the same
basis as other active duty military personnel (Priority 2). Installations plan and program adequate housing
to support active duty military families; therefore, it is critical to ensure accurate ID populations are
included in the manpower and requirements data provided in the HRMA.

2.6. Support Agreements. A host-tenant support agreement may be established between Air Force com-
mands, organizations, units or elements and between an AF organization and another Military Service
(Interservice Support Agreement) or another federal agency (Interagency Support Agreement). The
Commander may authorize personnel covered in the interservice or interagency support agreement (ISA)
to live in Air Force-controlled housing on the same basis as AF members. Follow procedures in AFI
25-201, Support Agreements Procedures and DoD Instruction (DoDI) 4000.19, Interservice and
Intragovernmental Support, for agreements with non-AF Services and agencies. The Air Force Office of
Regional Issues (HQ USAF/A5XX) is the approval authority for agreements with another country.

2.7. Air Force Standardized Housing Brochure. Provide an installation-specific housing brochure to
housing residents upon assignment. Brief residents of their responsibility for such routine maintenance,
minor repair, operation and housekeeping typically expected of tenants in similar community housing.
See paragraph 6.6. for resident responsibilities to be briefed at the initial, preterm and final inspections,
responsibilities for routine M&R during occupancy and for departure cleaning. See the following AFC-
ESA website for format and content of the Brochure. http://www.afcesa.af.mil/userdocuments/publi-
cations/miscellaneous/ceo/ceok/housingbrochuretemplate.pdf.

2.8. Resident Liability. Military and civilian residents are held liable for loss and damage to their
assigned FH unit, including equipment, furnishings, grounds and exterior facilities in their area of respon-
sibility caused by the abuse or negligence of the member, dependents, guests and pets, and for failure to
14                                                       AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007


clean an assigned unit satisfactorily upon termination (10 U.S.C. 2775 and DoD Regulation (DoDR)
7000.14).
     2.8.1. At the time of assignment, inform residents of the FH unit replacement cost, recommend rent-
     ers insurance and explain that when liability is determined, residents are required to pay for damages
     (paragraph 6.6.2.).
     2.8.2. Include a resident liability clause in every housing maintenance contract that requires the con-
     tractor to report suspected resident abuse or negligence when observed.
     2.8.3. The Housing Flight makes the initial determination whether or not the resident is responsible
     for the abuse or negligence, informs the resident of their liability and ensures the cost of damage is
     collected.
     2.8.4. Liability is determined in accordance with (IAW) 10 U.S.C. 2775 and AFMAN 23-220,
     Reports of Survey for Air Force Property. AFMAN 23-220 requires the Air Force to investigate and
     report damages or losses to government-owned housing of $500 or more. The Commander may, how-
     ever, initiate an ROS for damages or losses under $500 as appropriate for the circumstances.
     2.8.5. The ROS process may be disregarded when the value is less than $500 and the member is will-
     ing to pay for the damage. If the resident does not pay voluntarily, the Housing Flight requests a
     Report of Survey (ROS).
     2.8.6. With approval of the Housing Flight, the resident may repair the damage, pay a commercial
     contractor to repair the damage or allow the housing maintenance contractor to repair the damage and
     reimburse the government. In any case, the repair must have government approval before the inspec-
     tor clears the member from FH.
     2.8.7. For abandoned units, arrange for a commercial contractor to clean and repair occupant dam-
     ages and seek reimbursement from the member using DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment Authoriza-
     tion.
     2.8.8. Authority to deduct the cost of FH damage from the civilian employee pay is in DoDR
     7000.14, Financial Management Regulations, Chapter 8.
     2.8.9. Credit money collected for loss, damage to or cleaning FH to the installation MFH Operations
     and Maintenance (O&M) account. The Housing Flight monitors collection of damage assessments.

2.9. Insurance and Reimbursement Claims Against the Government. The government does not pro-
vide personal property or liability insurance for residents. Recommend to residents that they secure ade-
quate insurance coverage for their needs. The installation legal office considers claims for reimbursement
of personal property at a depreciated amount when FH is damaged through no fault of the resident.
Advise the resident to seek further assistance from the installation Judge Advocate (JA), if specialized
advice is required.

2.10. Privately Owned Firearms. Residents must comply with AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation
Security Program (FOUO) and other installation firearms policy.

2.11. Social Visits. FH units are appropriated for use as single-family dwellings and may not be jointly
occupied by more than one family. If defined as a dependent (Attachment 1), a relative of the member or
spouse is not considered a social visitor, regardless of the length of stay.
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                    15


   2.11.1. Bonafide social visits of 30 days or less do not constitute joint assignment of FH.
   2.11.2. Social visits of military personnel assigned to the installation and civilians residing outside
   the commuting area are limited to 30 days, and those residing within the commuting area are limited
   to 2 days. The Commander may authorize extension to the 30 days. Personnel authorized BAH or
   LQA who visit more than 30 days forfeit BAH and LQA.

2.12. Live-in Childcare Provider (Nanny): FH residents may employ a live-in childcare provider with
approval of the Commander. In coordination with the installation JA and Security Forces (SF), the Hous-
ing Flight develops a standardized installation template for members to use in requesting a live-in child-
care provider. The Housing Flight forwards requests meeting the following criteria to the Commander for
approval:
   2.12.1. Resident has dependent child, infant through high school age, residing in household.
   2.12.2. Nanny’s family status and relationship to member are identified.
   2.12.3. Nanny will reside in FH, unaccompanied.
   2.12.4. Private bedroom is available for nanny IAW this AFI and adherence to Table 4.3.
   2.12.5. Request meets installation the JA legal requirements for federal, state and local domestic
   employment laws and contracts, host nation provisions and SF security requirements for background
   checks, base entry and access to facilities.
NOTE: Approval of a live-in childcare provider does not imply entitlement to benefits or privileges to
which nonfamily members are not otherwise entitled nor does approval represent a FH bedroom require-
ment.

2.13. Commercial Activity in Family Housing (FH). Limited commercial activity that can be properly
carried out from a FH unit is allowed. Commercial activity is defined as a business enterprise conducted
for profit by family members assigned to a FH unit (DoDM 4165.63).
   2.13.1. Activities may involve direct sales of products, minor repair service on small items, incidental
   services, tutoring and limited manufacture of items.
   2.13.2. Sale of specific brand name merchandise not available in military exchanges is not construed
   as competition with installation officially sanctioned commerce.
   2.13.3. The member submits a written request to conduct commercial activity in assigned FH to the
   Housing Flight Chief. The Housing Flight Chief forwards request to the Commander for approval.
   Approval is required before business start-up.
   2.13.4. The following policies apply:
       2.13.4.1. Commercial activity may not be authorized or continued at the expense of community
       tranquility, safety or the installation mission.
       2.13.4.2. Local government licensing requirements, agreements, host nation business practices
       and advertising practices are taken into account as each request is considered. The member is
       responsible for obtaining necessary licenses.
   2.13.5. Childcare in FH units is a unique category of commercial activity and is governed by
   AFI 34-276, Family Child Care Programs (paragraph 2.17.).
16                                                         AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007


     2.13.6. The resident may request minor self-help modifications to FH unit to facilitate commercial
     activity. If approved, the resident follows self-help guidelines, complies with electrical and fire safety
     codes, pays for the modification and restores the FH unit to its original configuration upon departing
     the installation.
     2.13.7. DoDR 5500.7, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER), applies to soliciting from personnel junior in
     rank or grade. Family member employment in FH is authorized if the family member complies with
     this AFI and other Service regulations prohibiting solicited sales to subordinates. The prohibition
     against door-to-door solicitation, in person or via printed material, applies (DoDD 1344.7, Personnel
     Commercial Solicitation on DoD installations).
     2.13.8. Advise residents to obtain personal liability insurance, to cover the risk of legal actions from
     customers and damage to government property, since residents conducting a private business in FH
     could be held personally liable for loss or damage.

2.14. Resident Responsibility for Grounds. FH residents are responsible for maintaining grounds for
their exclusive use extending from the footprint of the structure to the border of common areas. Exclusive
use is defined as the area within a natural boundary (playground, tree line, sidewalk, driveway, fence,
common area boundary such as a park, picnic area, flower garden, and so forth) or halfway to adjoining
residence. Provide information in the installation-specific housing brochure for grounds care unique to
the installation and area.
     2.14.1. The MAJCOM Commander may approve a waiver for the government to provide partial or
     complete grounds care when one of the following criteria is met. Approval authority in this AFI
     applies to non-GOQs only and may not be delegated below the MAJCOM Civil Engineer. For GOQ
     grounds maintenance waivers, see AFI 32-6003.
        2.14.1.1. The residence is prominently located and makes a unique contribution to the appearance
        of the installation.
        2.14.1.2. The area for the exclusive use of the resident is extremely large (more than 1/2 acre).
        Waiver provides government-furnished grounds maintenance beyond the 1/2 acre surrounding the
        home. For ease of grounds maintenance and overall appearance, the Housing Flight Chief and res-
        ident jointly determine the location and layout of the 1/2 acre for which the resident is responsible.
        2.14.1.3. Areas with unique landscaping, extra large trees or shrubbery, or trees requiring profes-
        sional service or specialized equipment.

2.15. Self-Help Program. The Air Force supports the Self-Help Program to foster pride of ownership in
FH. This program allows residents to accomplish minor work in their FH unit to benefit their living con-
ditions and can reduce maintenance costs to the government. Housing funds support the FH Self-Help
Program, and the BCE and Housing Flight jointly establish guidance to operate the program (AF Pam-
phlet 32-1098, Base Civil Engineer Self-Help Guide, and paragraph 11.11.).
     2.15.1. Residents submit AF IMT 332, BCE Work Request, to request minor modifications to the
     housing unit and surrounding grounds and may request government-furnished materials on the AF
     IMT 332.
     2.15.2. When AF IMT 332 requests grounds work and digging is required, an AF IMT 103, Base
     Civil Engineer Work Clearance Request, must be approved before starting work.
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                    17


   2.15.3. The housing inspector or respective shop craftsman inspects self-help projects, and the Hous-
   ing Flight maintains Self-Help Program records on file and in ACES-HM. Self-help improvements
   may be donated by the resident and accepted by the Air Force when workmanship and aesthetics meet
   acceptable construction standards. Self-help work must not be used to increase the square footage of
   the unit by constructing additions or enclosing and weather proofing existing exterior porches, car-
   ports, patios or decks, and so forth. Inform the resident that FH unit must be returned to the original
   configuration before departing the installation unless the government or incoming resident accepts
   project. Advise resident of requirement to comply with the installation-specific housing brochure for
   grounds care unique to the installation and area.

2.16. Self-Help Store. The Housing Flight Chief coordinates the self-help store operations with the BCE
or provides for a contractor-operated store if housing maintenance is contracted.
   2.16.1. The self-help store makes available to housing residents a list of stocked housing items, cus-
   tomer training and guidance on completing basic tasks and instructions for using tools.
   2.16.2. Self-help stores may provide hand tools and lawn equipment on a loaner basis but may not
   provide materials for installation of in-ground lawn sprinklers to FH residents.

2.17. Self-Help Work in FH to Support the Family Child Care Program. In most instances, modifi-
cations to FH dwelling units supporting the installation Family Child Care Program are accomplished
using donated self-help labor and materials. When clear evidence shows the Family Child Care Program
is unable to provide adequate childcare because of the high cost of home daycare modifications and the
installation mission could be affected, the Commander may authorize government-funded labor and mate-
rials to support required FH modifications (paragraph 2.13.5., AFI 34-276 and AF Pamphlet 32-1098).

2.18. Flags in Family Housing (FH). At the Commander’s discretion, FH M&R funds may be used to
purchase and install United States (American) flags. Make flags available through the installation
Self-Help Store.

2.19. Lawn Irrigation Systems. To reduce irrigation requirements in arid and semiarid climates, use
xeriscape principles to the maximum extent practical and as comparable to local community housing.
   2.19.1. Lawn irrigation systems may be provided in (1) any yard size, regardless of rank, where the
   average annual rainfall is less than 20 inches as defined by the Air Force Combat Climatology Center
   (AFCCC) (Attachment 2 and Air Force Family Housing Guide) or (2) in any yard ½ acre or greater
   (lot size less the footprint of the unit). Note: For GOQs only, approval is SAF/IEI.
   2.19.2. In installing irrigation systems, do not create a condition that violates Executive Order 13148,
   Greening the Government Through Leadership in Environmental Management and Guidance for
   Presidential Memorandum of Environmentally and Economically Beneficial Landscape Practices on
   Federal Landscaped Grounds, 60 Federal Register 40837.

2.20. Key and Essential (K&E), Command and Special Command Positions (SCP). M A J C O M
approval authority is required to hold FH units vacant for more than 90 days. Refer to AFI 32-6003 for
guidance on general officers and SCPs.
   2.20.1. MAJCOM commanders may require K&E personnel, including incumbents of command
   positions, to reside on the installation as a condition of employment. MAJCOM and installation com-
18                                                       AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007


     manders should strictly limit K&E positions to those necessary to reside on the installation to perform
     their mission.
     2.20.2. The Commander may designate specific FH units for personnel in K&E, SCP and Command
     positions who reside on the installation as a matter of military necessity. Commanders may assign a
     member, other than the intended occupant, to a designated housing unit. Assigned members acknowl-
     edge, in writing, they may be required to relocate at government expense to another on-base or
     off-base housing compatible with their grade and bedroom requirement when the FH is required by
     designated incumbent.
        2.20.2.1. (Added-354FW) Incumbent of the 354th Wing Commander position is designated for
        priority assignment to military family housing – Number One Eielson Place.
     2.20.3. K&E and Command housing may be held vacant for 90 days pending the arrival of incum-
     bent.
     2.20.4. The Commander establishes a K&E position only when there is a compelling need for a mem-
     ber to live on base. For example, incumbent is required to respond to continual operational require-
     ments or emergencies and off-base residency would adversely impact the installation readiness, safety
     and security or health and welfare of the base population. The Commander identifies K&E positions
     in an installation supplement to this instruction.
        2.20.4.1. Do not designate a specific FH unit for every incumbent of a K&E position; instead,
        reserve certain areas or groups of houses for K&E personnel.
            2.20.4.1.1. (Added-354FW) Incumbents of the following key staff positions will have prior-
            ity assignment to military family housing Number Two Eielson Place through Number Nine
            Eielson Place as follows:

            2.20.4.1.3.15. (Added-354FW) 354th Wing Comptroller Squadron Commander
     2.20.4.2. When housing is not immediately available identify incumbents of K&E positions in
     ACES-HM, which places them at the top of the appropriate waiting list. This includes the freeze
     zone, but does not displace members with a firm housing commitment.
     2.20.4.3. The Commander may waive the requirement for an incumbent of a designated position
     to reside on the installation under the following conditions:
         2.20.4.3.1. Adequate FH is not or will not be available to meet incumbent’s family size and
         composition, or housing is geographically separated from the installation and is the only suit-
         able housing available.
         2.20.4.3.2. The incumbent owns or is purchasing housing in the local community at the time
         of assignment to the K&E position. Incumbents with this waiver who subsequently apply for
         government housing are placed on the waiting list, compete with other members in their grade
         and bedroom category and are not given priority assignment.
  2.20.5. Command positions are commanders and vice commanders of MAJCOMs, numbered Air
  Forces, centers, wings, groups and their deputies and command chief master sergeants (CCM) of
  MAJCOMs, numbered Air Forces, centers, wings and installations. MAJCOM commanders may
  authorize additional command positions and designate specific housing units. Authority may not be
  delegated below the MAJCOM Civil Engineer.
     2.20.5.1. (Added-354FW) Incumbent of the Wing Command Chief Master Sergeant (CCM)
     position will have priority assignment to military family facility 4807.
     2.20.5.2. (Added-354FW) Incumbents of the following key and essential First Sergeant positions
     will have priority assignment to military family housing.

            2.20.5.2.10. (Added-354FW) 3rd Air Support Operations Squadron First Sergeant

2.21. Unaccompanied Personnel in Designated Position. When a member assigned to a Command or
K&E position is single or not accompanied by family members and there are no other on-base facilities,
such as visiting quarters (VQ), FH may be diverted to UH. Use FH funds to maintain FH diverted to UH.
Diverted FH must comply with congressional M&R limits. Update ACES to reflect the diversion and
assign member to UH (AFI 32-6005).
     2.21.1. (Added-354FW) Unaccompanied Personnel in any of the above listed positions will be pro-
     vided appropriate unaccompanied quarters in lieu of family housing.

2.22. Unaccompanied Members in Housing with Dependents Residing Elsewhere. U n d e r c e r t a i n
conditions, members with dependents residing elsewhere may occupy housing and receive BAH at the
with-dependent rate.
     2.22.1. A member may occupy UH or other government housing that does not exceed minimum stan-
     dards (Table 2.1.) for the member’s grade without dependents and still be eligible to receive BAH at
     the with-dependent rate if (a) member is unaccompanied and (b) family members are not residing in
     adequate government housing elsewhere (DoD Financial Management Regulation (FMR), 260301C).
     2.22.2. The following applies only to personnel designated as K&E. All others are ineligible for this
     exception: If the member occupies UH or other government housing which exceed the unaccompa-
     nied minimum standard for member’s grade, BAH is terminated. If the occupied housing is the only
     housing available and (a) housing is not suitable for joint occupancy or (b) housing is suitable for joint
     occupancy and jointly occupied with another member of the appropriate grade permanently assigned
     to the duty station, BAH may not be terminated.
        2.22.2.1. AF policy is to discourage the use of government-owned FH units as temporary UH.
        FH units or other housing temporarily designated as UH are considered adequate for joint occu-
        pancy if they have at least two private bedrooms, two separate full bathrooms, with a total net liv-
        ing area at least equivalent to the total net living area the joint residents would each be entitled to
        if it were permanent UH. Members in grades O-1 to O-10, W-1 to W-5 and GS-10 and above must
        have access to a living room, kitchen and dining area (not necessarily private) as shown in Table
        2.1.
        2.22.2.2. Regarding clause (b) in paragraph 2.22.2., the housing must actually be jointly occu-
        pied, although such housing may be singularly occupied for no longer than 30 days to accommo-
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                   21


       date a change if one of the joint residents departs permanent change of station (PCS). SAF/IE may
       approve waivers to this policy to relieve hardship circumstances (other than financial).
   2.22.3. This provision applies to all locations and to FH units or other government housing tempo-
   rarily designated (diverted) as UH.
   2.22.4. Assign unaccompanied members to housing that meet minimum adequacy standards for their
   grade, when possible.

NOTES:
     1. If quarters are not suitable for joint occupancy, pay BAH.
       2. If quarters are suitable for joint occupancy and are jointly occupied, pay BAH; if not jointly
          occupied, do not pay BAH.

2.23. Prestige Family Housing (FH) and Command Chief Master Sergeants (CCM).
   2.23.1. Designate all E9 housing as prestige housing, categorized as follows (Table 4.2. and Table
   4.3.):
       2.23.1.1. Air Force E-9 CCMs, and equivalent members from other Services residing on Air
       Force installations and joint bases managed by the Air Force, position listed on CMSAF-approved
       list; specific prestige unit designated; four-bedroom requirement; 10 percent size increase applies
       (paragraph 2.23.2.).
22                                                       AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007


        2.23.1.2. E-9 K&E; Commander may designate specific prestige housing unit; four-bedroom
        requirement.
        2.23.1.3. All other E-9s; prestige housing; three- or four-bedroom requirement; based on family
        size and composition.
        2.23.1.4. (Added-354FW) Family housing facilities in the 4804 - 4810 area are designated Chief
        prestige housing.
     2.23.2. All prestige housing must meet standards in the Air Force Family Housing Guide for Plan-
     ning, Programming, Design and Construction. For new/replacement construction, units designated
     for CCMs (only those approved by the CMSAF) may be increased by an additional 10 percent of the
     largest sized E-9 house at the installation, not to exceed the programming benchmark size of new/
     replacement construction (1940 net square feet (NSF)/2410 gross square feet (GSF)) (Air Force Fam-
     ily Housing Planning Guide for Planning, Programming, Design and Construction).
     2.23.3. Commanders must carefully review and validate designated E-9 positions. The HRMA deter-
     mines maximum on-base prestige housing requirements. Since CCMs are K&E, assignment priority
     is the same as other K&E personnel. Identify prestige housing in ACES by changing the designation
     to "Chief Prestige" and maintain a separate waiting list.
     2.23.4. The Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force (CMSAF) is the approval authority for any
     changes to CCM positions at the MAJCOM, wing, number AF, joint command and center, including
     equivalent members from other Services residing on Air Force installations and joint bases managed
     by the Air Force. See CMSAF-approved list at the AF Townhall website (https://www.airforce-
     housing.hq.af.mil/). Submit request for additional prestige housing units through the MAJCOM
     Civil Engineer to HQ USAF/A7CH. Include the following justification:


            Title of position
            Normal grade for position
            Present incumbent of position
            Identification of unit proposed for such designation
            Reason to establish prestige FH requirement
            Impact if not approved

2.24. Unit Moves and Base Closures. Give equal consideration for available housing at the gaining
installation to all eligible DoD personnel identified for PCS reassignment during a unit move. It is essen-
tial to provide members advance notice of housing available at the gaining installation so they can make
suitable arrangements for their families. Public notification of housing availability promotes morale and
efficiency of personnel, whether advance or incremental staff. Due to time-phasing activities of unit
moves (especially multiple units), commanders of the losing and gaining installations usually negotiate
the effective merger date of waiting lists to ensure equity for all concerned and the shortest possible wait-
ing lists. Send unresolved issues to the MAJCOM Civil Engineer for resolution and to HQ USAF/A7CH
for final determination, if necessary. The following procedures apply:
     2.24.1. Losing Commanders:
        2.24.1.1. Identify personnel selected for PCS reassignment with the unit.
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                    23


       2.24.1.2. Submit list of eligible personnel to be considered for FH at the gaining installation.
       Arrange list from losing installation, considered the advance application, by grade category and
       effective date of housing application. Send list to the gaining installation at least 45 days before
       the effective date of the unit move.
       2.24.1.3. Submit proposed K&E personnel list to the gaining installation commander.
       2.24.1.4. If required, enter into host-tenant negotiations at the earliest practical date before the
       unit move (paragraph 2.6.).
   2.24.2. Gaining Commanders:
       2.24.2.1. Merge incoming unit personnel list with existing FH waiting lists.
       2.24.2.2. Evaluate impact of the unit move on existing waiting lists and revise housing assign-
       ment forecasts.
       2.24.2.3. If applicable, enter into host-tenant negotiations with the incoming unit commander.
       2.24.2.4. If adequate FH is unavailable, make other arrangements to house incoming personnel.
       2.24.2.5. Provide effective housing services to all personnel, including expanded housing referral
       services, as necessary.
   2.24.3. Honor commitments for housing assignments at the gaining installation, issued before the
   waiting lists were merged.
   2.24.4. Merge the final personnel list of the incoming unit with the gaining base waiting lists at least
   30 days before the scheduled arrival of the incoming advance party. If the incoming unit personnel
   strength is revised before the effective date of the unit move, adjust the merged waiting lists, accord-
   ingly. Merge the waiting lists on a pro rata basis, as follows:
       2.24.4.1. Merge the list from losing base A (300), with the waiting list of gaining base B (100), as
       follows: B-A-A-A-B-A-A-A and so forth. Do not bump members in a freeze status on the gaining
       installations waiting list.
   2.24.5. Post the merged waiting lists in the Housing Flight for public view by incoming units and by
   the gaining installation.
   2.24.6. Send a welcome package and provide forecasted waiting times to incoming personnel. Use
   an ACES-generated or locally produced DD Form 1747, Status of Housing Availability.
   2.24.7. Give incoming K&E personnel priority housing assignment but do not displace members on
   the waiting list who have a firm commitment for housing.

2.25. Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Transition Personnel. Move members and their fami-
lies on a scheduled basis with continual coordination among all functional installation activities. Close
FH units consistent with the capability to provide essential support and services. Current FH residents
who are members of the BRAC team placing the base in caretaker status may send their dependents to the
next duty station in advance of their departure. The following conditions apply:
   2.25.1. Assign housing to unaccompanied family members at the gaining installation under normal
   priority and procedures. The effective date of application is the walk-in date of the family member.
   2.25.2. The sponsor's projected arrival date to gaining installation is within 90 days.
24                                                       AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007


     2.25.3. The qualifying family member presents a duly executed Power of Attorney (POA) with
     authorization to conduct housing business, PCS orders and a letter signed by the losing Commander
     certifying the member is delayed due to assignment to a transition closure team.
     2.25.4. The family member’s decisions on personal preference options, bedroom and housing accep-
     tance are final and may not be overturned by the sponsor.

2.26. Government-Owned Carpet. Installed carpet, including pad, is considered an alternative floor
finish and an integral part of the FH unit. Professionally clean government-installed carpet, as needed,
typically during change of occupancy, IAW the most current engineering technical letter (ETL) and man-
ufacturer instructions to preserve the quality and life of the carpet.
     2.26.1. When carpet is authorized, install carpet in living areas, except kitchen, bathroom, powder
     room, patio, porch and areas exposed to weather. Avoid installing carpet at entrances and heavy-traf-
     fic areas. To minimize damage to flooring and subflooring, glue-down installation is not allowed.
     2.26.2. Maintain the following historical information in the Housing Flight for each carpet installa-
     tion:
        2.26.2.1. Location (FH address, building number and rooms).
        2.26.2.2. Name of carpet manufacturer, pattern and color.
        2.26.2.3. Manufacturer certification that carpet conforms to the most recent ETL Air Force Car-
        pet Standard. ETLs are available at the following AFCESA website: http://www.afcesa.af.mil/
        library/etl.asp?Category=Engineering%20Technical%20Letters
        2.26.2.4. Date of installation.
        2.26.2.5. Method of installation and type of pad used.
        2.26.2.6. Certification of disposal and certification that new carpet meets AF standards.
     2.26.3. Purchase quality carpet with a minimum 7-year life expectancy, meeting AF standards in the
     Air Force Family Housing Guide for Planning, Programming, Design, and Construction and the most
     recent ETL. Before purchase, the BCE certifies the carpet meets AF carpet standards.
     2.26.4. Selected carpet must be a neutral color, such as beige, taupe or off-white in a light to medium
     shade that provides a flexible background that can integrate with the decor of successive occupants.
     Do not use pure whites or dark shades. Use solid colors or muted tone-on-tone tweeds.
     2.26.5. When replacing carpet in less than 7 years, the Commander or delegated representative certi-
     fies the carpet is no longer serviceable and requires replacement, and replacement carpet meets AF
     standards (paragraph 1.6.9.10. and AFI 32-6003).

2.27. Automated Civil Engineer System-Housing Management (ACES-HM) and Automated Hous-
ing Referral Network (AHRN). ACES-HM is the Air Force Civil Engineer standard management soft-
ware for managing family and unaccompanied housing. Use data extracted from ACES-HM to validate
the IFHMP and FH Military Construction (MILCON) projects, identify and monitor surplus housing and
develop management initiatives. ACES-HM is the primary tool used to plan, advocate, program, design
and execute FH and UH requirements. AHRN is the single DoD repository for rental housing property.
Do not fund or use other information systems when the functions exist in ACES and AHRN and do not
duplicate AHRN functions in ACES.
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                     25


   2.27.1. Reporting and data extraction (mining) occur at every level of command and the assumption
   is that data in ACES-HM is accurate and reliable. It is critical that housing staffs at all locations use
   ACES-HM exclusively to record, manage, monitor and track the following:
      2.27.1.1. FH applicants, waiting lists, change of occupancy maintenance (COM), offers, declina-
      tions, projections and assignments into and out of government-controlled housing.
      2.27.1.2. Inspection schedules, inspection results and M&R of FH units.
      2.27.1.3. Drayage and storage, authorizations and obligations.
      2.27.1.4. Type, total number and status of FH facilities; including surplus units determined by the
      most current HRMA, units identified as inadequate by type based on the Condition Assessment
      Matrix (CAM) score from the latest HCP, inactive and diverted units.
   2.27.2. Except at locations where AHRN is deployed use ACES for community housing referral and
   relocation. At deployed locations, use AHRN for managing housing referral and relocation programs.
   At foreign OCONUS locations only, record and maintain member (community) leases in ACES.
   2.27.3. Develop a quality assurance (QA) program to promote data integrity and employ best prac-
   tices to ensure timely and accurate information is maintained in ACES-HM. A responsive QA pro-
   gram is required to enable accurate occupancy metrics, validate HRMA, HCP, IFHMP, justify
   funding, develop management initiatives and to reconcile BAH with FSOs.
   2.27.4. The ACES generated MFH Occupancy and Utilization Report is the AF tool for determining
   the utilization FH facilities, providing justification for funding, managing change of occupancy time-
   lines, and supporting construction, demolition and renovation of assets. Installations and MAJCOMs
   accomplish reporting requirements in accordance with the latest AF/A7CA guidance.
      2.27.4.1. Installations with traditional FH accomplish the ACES generated MFH Occupancy and
      Utilization Report quarterly, inclusive of 01 Oct - 31 Dec (1st quarter), 01 Jan - 31 Mar (2nd quar-
      ter), 01 Apr - 30 Jun (3rd quarter) and 01 Jul - 30 Sep (4th quarter) and forward to their MAJCOM.
      2.27.4.2. MAJCOMs review installation quarterly reports to validate type, total number and sta-
      tus of FH facilities, including surplus units determined by the most current HRMA, units identi-
      fied as inadequate, by type, based on CAM scores from the latest HCP, inactive and diverted units
      and change of occupancy timelines.
      2.27.4.3. MAJCOMs forward the installation reports to HQ USAF/A7CA by the 5th of Feb, May,
      Aug and Nov of each calendar year.
   2.27.5. Coordinate day-to-day ACES operations with communications squadrons (installation net-
   work control centers) and provide notification to the 754 Electronics Systems Group (ELSG), Combat
   System Support Help Desk, to facilitate reconciliation of slow response times and connectivity issues.
   The 754 ELSG Help Desk website is https://ceds.ssg.gunter.af.mil/login.asp

2.28. Education Leave of Absence Program (ELAP):
   2.28.1. Members enrolled in ELAP may retain FH while enrolled in the ELAP program on a space
   available basis, but must pay a rental charge equal to BAH at the member’s current grade, beginning
   the date the ELAP contract is signed. The Housing Flight computes the rental rate, prepares and sends
   the paperwork to finance. The member is responsible for arranging rental payments with the FSO.
26                                                        AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007


     ELAP members may apply for waiver to rental payments on same basis as other hardship cases (10
     U.S.C. 708).
     2.28.2. To the extent possible do not displace ELAP enrollees from FH except to house K&E person-
     nel. The member may retain housing while enrolled in ELAP, even though there is a waiting list for
     the type and bedroom category of the house occupied.

2.29. Environmental Hazard Disclosure. Fully disclose to FH residents the following environmental
hazards, either upon assignment, delivery to residence or by making available in public access areas, as
appropriate. Refer residents who report potential environmental-related health issues to their health care
provider. Request the Bioenvironmental Engineer determine requirements for a follow-up health risk
assessment. Coordinate development and periodic update of the installation fact sheets with the BCE and
Bioenvironmental Engineering. See www.epa.gov for ordering brochures and extended information.
     2.29.1. Asbestos. Upon assignment, provide resident an installation letter or fact sheet about the
     potential risk of asbestos exposure, either locally developed or adapted from information on the EPA
     website. Inform residents of common elements of housing, particularly older housing, that contain
     asbestos (for example, floor tiles and adhesives, furnace ductwork, roofing shingles and siding) and
     the potential for exposure to asbestos fibers when items are cut, sanded or scraped.
     2.29.2. Lead and Lead-Based Paint (LBP). Upon assignment, provide resident the EPA pamphlet,
     “Protect Your Family from Lead in Your Home.” Include an installation-specific information paper or
     letter containing lead sampling performed by the installation and how to access sampling results for
     their FH unit or unit type. Maintain a signed disclosure form in resident file.
     2.29.3. Mold. Upon assignment, provide resident the EPA publication, A Brief Guide to Mold, Mois-
     ture and Your Home, and make the guide available to all residents in an appropriate public area. Addi-
     tionally, provide a current installation-specific fact sheet including the preventive measures in
     paragraphs 2.29.3.1. – 2.29.3.6. to residents in coastal areas and other locations with high humidity, in
     housing with a history of water damage and in housing where construction design has proven suscep-
     tible to mold growth.
        2.29.3.1. Immediately on FH resident notification of mold, a housing inspector and a maintenance
        service provider jointly conduct a visual inspection of the unit to identify mold growth and water
        leaks on wall surfaces and in building systems (HVAC, ductwork, roof, windows, and so forth)
        and potential safety risks (electrical shock and structural failure). If indicated by the inspection,
        determine habitability of the unit, and schedule a comprehensive inspection and repair according
        to severity of the problem. Keep the resident fully informed of inspection results and remediation
        plans.
        2.29.3.2. If mold is located in multiple areas or is so extensive (more than 10 square feet) that
        remediation or repair cannot be accomplished in the service provider emergency response time-
        frame, immediately relocate resident to temporary lodging until assessment is complete.
        2.29.3.3. Refer residents reporting mold-related health concerns to their health care provider for
        an evaluation. If requested by the health care provider to support medical diagnosis and treatment,
        request Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) conduct an appropriate health risk assessment.
        2.29.3.4. Based on recommendation from a health care provider or as required by the scope of the
        repair, relocate resident from temporary lodging to another adequate house.
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                 27


     2.29.3.5. For minor mold and mildew or condensation on ceilings, walls and windows, request
     service provider measure indoor humidity and advise resident on how to keep humidity low
     (below 60 percent).
     2.29.3.6. Recommend the following mold preventive measures to FH residents, modified as
     appropriate for the installation, but under no circumstances require a resident reporting mold sen-
     sitivity to clean mold from their FH unit. In high humidity locations, periodically publish preven-
     tive measures in the installation newspaper:


             • Dry condensation from affected areas
             • Increase air circulation by using a household fan, kitchen vent hood
               exhaust while cooking and bathroom exhaust when shower is in use
             • Minimize dust accumulation throughout the house and clean mildew
               from visible surfaces using a detergent and water or mild household
               cleaner, wearing ordinary household rubber gloves
             • Routinely empty water from the air conditioner drip pan
             • Report recurring leaks and persistent mold, mildew and moisture to the
               Housing Flight or maintenance service provider

  2.29.4. Radon. Upon assignment, provide resident with the EPA publication, A Citizen’s Guide to
  Radon, The Guide to protecting Yourself and Your Family From Radon, and summary results from any
  installation radon testing. EPA and the Surgeon General recommend testing all homes below the third
  floor level for radon. Consider furnishing simple radon test kits in the Self-Help Store.

                                                 Chapter 3

                                 ELIGIBILITY AND APPLICATIONS

3.1. Eligibility of Military Members. Members of all Military Services who are commissioned officers,
warrant officers and enlisted personnel on active duty and eligible for BAH at the with-dependent rate,
except military-married-to-military (mil-to-mil), are eligible for FH when accompanied by a dependent or
will be accompanied by a dependent within 30 days except dependent college student. In OCONUS
areas, personnel are eligible for FH if they are serving an accompanied tour and are accompanied or will
be joined by authorized command-sponsored dependents within 30 days. Note: The terms dependent and
family member" are synonymous.
     3.1.1. Mil-to-mil Members. Mil-to-mil members are authorized FH when jointly assigned to the
     installation. In OCONUS areas, both members must be serving an accompanied tour in the area.
     3.1.2. Mil-to-mil parents Separated with Joint Custody of Common Dependents. Only the member
     receiving with-dependent BAH is authorized housing. When physical custody is divided equally
     between the mil-to-mil parents, only the member receiving with dependant rate BAH is assigned FH
     (DoDM 4165.63). If the child will be absent from the FH household for more than 30 days, the mem-
     ber must have a Commander-approved waiver to retain FH pending return of dependent at a specified
     date.
     3.1.3. Single Military Members. Single members are authorized FH if receiving with-dependent
     BAH and the dependent shares the household. A military member separated from a civilian spouse,
     with shared custody of a common dependent, must have physical (controlling) custody (referred to as
     custodial custody) of dependent child to be eligible for FH (Attachment 1). If the child will be absent

     and member provides proof of marriage before housing assignment. In OCONUS areas, the member
     must be serving an accompanied tour and have command sponsorship for dependent before assign-
     ment to FH. The member must provide proof of command sponsorship at OCONUS locations before

NOTES:
     1. In OCONUS areas, one American Red Cross (ARC) senior director, hub manager, station
        manager or assistant station manager, per location, may be assigned to FH without rental
        charge. Other ARC employees in OCONUS areas pay LQA equal to equivalent DoD civilian
        employees. In CONUS, ARC employees are housed on the same basis as DoD civilians and
        are assessed a fair market rental charge (paragraph 5.5.).
      2. Foreign military personnel pay rental amount equal to the BAH rate of comparable U.S. mili-
         tary personnel grade. Once established at the beginning of the tour of duty, do not increase the
         monthly rental charges during the tour regardless of whether the foreign officer is promoted or
         U.S. officers receive an increase in BAH.

        3. Entitlement to BAH for either/or both members is governed by Department Of Defense Mili-
           tary Pay and Allowances Entitlements Manual (DoDPM), part 3, and 37 U.S.C. 403.
        4. Both members are authorized housing if each member has dependents in his or her own right.
        5. If members have joint custody of common dependents, only the member collecting the
           with-dependent rate BAH is entitled to FH.

3.3. Applications for Family Housing (FH). As required, assist applicants with the application process.
Eligible members may submit applications to the gaining installation Housing Flight any time after
receiving PCS or active duty orders. The member completes DD Form 1746, Application for Assign-
ment to Housing, and provides PCS orders. ANG and Reserve members provide active duty orders. If
applying online at the Air Force Portal (secure) or through ACES, members provide orders via FAX, elec-
tronic transmission or postal service to the gaining installation Housing Flight. Personnel acting on behalf
of a military member must also provide a duly executed POA. The effective date of application is the date
members depart their losing permanent duty station (PDS). If available housing at the gaining installation
is privatized, contact the local Housing Flight for information in assisting member to submit an advance
application. The status of housing applications is available in 2-3 business days at https://www.airforce-
housing.hq.af.mil/.
     3.3.1. Members with an impending entitlement (promotion, increase in the number or maturation of
     dependent) that would entitle member to an additional bedroom in the following 12 months must pro-
     vide supporting documentation and note the entitlement in the remarks section of the application.
     Members applying at the Housing Flight provide documentation with the housing application. Mem-
     bers applying online provide information on the advance application, print a confirmation copy and
     present the online application and supporting documentation to the gaining Housing Flight upon
     arrival. The Housing Flight requires a physician statement to confirm pregnancy and a written state-
     ment from the military personnel flight (MPF) to confirm selection for promotion.
        3.3.1.1. Advanced Application. Members ordered to active duty or PCS to a new location may
        submit advance applications. The effective date of advance applications is the date the applicant
        departs the losing installation (including members with TDY enroute) or the date ordered to active
        duty. The effective date of application may not predate the date of entry on active duty.
        3.3.1.2. Walk-in Applications. The effective date for a member who walks into the gaining instal-
        lation Housing Flight is as follows:
            3.3.1.2.1. If within 30 days of arrival, the application date will be the departure date from the
            losing installation.
            3.3.1.2.2. If more than 30 days after arrival, the application date will be the date of the
            walk-in.
            3.3.1.2.3. If the date of application is the walk-in date and dependents have not arrived on the
            installation or arrival is more than 30 days; the application date will be the date member’s
            dependents arrive on the installation.
     3.3.2. Mil-to-Mil personnel assigned to the same duty station may apply for FH before approval of
     joint spouse assignment when one member arrives before the other.
     3.3.3. A family member, with a POA duly executed by the member, may apply for and be assigned
     housing at the gaining installation when the member departs an accompanied tour and performs tem-
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                       35


   porary duty (TDY) enroute to the PCS location. When the military member is attending Officer
   Training School, the family member may accept enlisted housing if available, but will be required to
   move into officer housing after the newly commissioned officer arrives at the installation. The move
   will be at member’s expense.

3.4. Unauthorized Applications. Members may not apply for (or be assigned to) FH under any one of
the following circumstances:
   3.4.1. Member is notified (if member knows date) of impending PCS and has less than 6 months
   remaining on station, or until retirement or administrative separation, except for reasons of military
   necessity or to relieve a hardship. Paragraph 3.4.3. does not apply to this prohibition.
   3.4.2. The Commander has evicted the member from FH. Reapplication requires written authoriza-
   tion from the Commander.
   3.4.3. Member does not agree to occupy the FH unit for 1 year.

3.5. Application To, From and Between OCONUS Locations. The requirements and conditions for
submitting advance applications for housing to and from OCONUS areas follow:
   3.5.1. PCS from CONUS to OCONUS location. The advance application date for FH at the gaining
   installation is the date member departs the losing CONUS installation.
   3.5.2. PCS from Long Tour In OCONUS to CONUS. The advance application date for FH at the
   gaining installation is the date member departs the losing installation. If the member elects a consec-
   utive OCONUS tour, due to base closure or drawdown, the date of estimated return from overseas
   (DEROS) changes. If the transfer is within 30 months of the date member departed CONUS or date
   member arrived in theater, the advance application date at the gaining installation is the date of depar-
   ture from the CONUS losing installation or arrival date in theater, whichever is later. Confirm date
   departed CONUS via PCS orders.
   3.5.3. Transfer Within or Between OCONUS Theaters Before Completing Tour. Advance applica-
   tions from members involuntarily transferred before completing their OCONUS tour within or
   between OCONUS theaters may receive priority placement on the gaining installation waiting list.
   The following rules apply:
       3.5.3.1. The effective date of application is the date of departure from the first losing installation.
       If member submitted no application to the second losing installation, the effective date for the
       gaining installation is the date the member departed the first losing installation, assuming the
       member was then eligible for FH; otherwise, the effective application date is the date of eligibility
       for FH.
       3.5.3.2. Maximum credit may not exceed authorized tour length at the gaining installation.
       3.5.3.3. The transfer must occur before the last 6 months of member’s current tour.
       3.5.3.4. The member must apply for housing at the gaining installation within 30 days of arrival
       to obtain retroactive credit.

3.6. Unaccompanied Dependents Restricted (UDR) Tour.
   3.6.1. Eligibility:
36                                                       AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007


        3.6.1.1. Applicants (including members of other Services) eligible for FH and transferring from a
        UDR tour receive priority placement on the gaining installation waiting list on the date the appli-
        cation is received. Give credit for the number of months spent on the UDR tour at the losing instal-
        lation and limit credit to the normal UDR tour length.
        3.6.1.2. Applicants deployed to the Central Command (CENTCOM) area of responsibility (AOR)
        for a consecutive 365 days and will PCS within 60 days of returning to their assigned location
        receive priority placement. The effective date of application will be the date the member entered
        the AOR. Require a copy of member’s paid travel voucher to verify date of application.
        3.6.1.3. Family members relocating to other than home-basing or follow-on assignment location.
     3.6.2. Procedures:
        3.6.2.1. When member applies for FY within 30 days of returning from a UDR tour, add member
        to the waiting list effective the first day of the arrival month member entered the UDR without
        bypassing members in the freeze zone.
        3.6.2.2. When member is authorized home basing or a follow-on assignment and has departed the
        installation or is at the UDR location, a family member with a duly executed POA may apply for
        and occupy government housing in CONUS and OCONUS in member’s absence.
            3.6.2.2.1. The effective date of the application is the date the family member applies as a
            walk-in or online applicant. If the family member has not received a housing assignment when
            the member completes and returns from the UDR tour, the application effective date is
            adjusted to include, but may not exceed, the UDR tour length.
            3.6.2.2.2. Do not give short tour credit to mil-to-mil members when both return from a joint
            remote tour of duty.
            3.6.2.2.3. Date of rank (DOR) is adjusted to reflect UDR credit for eligible senior officer
            applicants.
NOTE: The SOFA between the United States and foreign governments takes precedence over AF hous-
ing policy. Members should determine SOFA restrictions before commitment to any action that might
leave family members unaccompanied. In some countries, family members may not be allowed to remain
in country when the military member is no longer assigned to the installation. Caution member to verify
housing and TLA entitlements or restrictions at the follow-on location with the MPF before requesting
advance travel for dependents.
     3.6.3. The following are excluded from provisions in paragraph 3.6.:
        3.6.3.1. Member acquires dependent in the UDR tour area.
        3.6.3.2. Member with dependent traveling with them or joining them at the UDR location at gov-
        ernment expense.
        3.6.3.3. Family members relocating to other than home-basing or follow-on assignment location.

                                OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES

4.1. Waiting Lists. The Housing Flight maintains separate waiting lists in ACES by grade, bedroom
requirement and type of housing requested (Table 4.1., Table 4.2. and Table 4.3.).

4.2. Prioritizing Waiting Lists. Use the following priorities to determine placement on the waiting list.
Commanders may approve other than the following priority placement on a case-by-case hardship basis.
   4.2.1. Priority 1. Members and civilians assigned to SCP, K&E positions and Command positions.
   Personnel with Commander-approved hardships, after SCP, K&E and Command positions (AFI
   32-6003).
   4.2.2. Priority 2.
       4.2.2.1. Eligible members and equivalent civilians (in OCONUS areas) who are assigned or
       attached to the installation for duty, or assigned to another installation served by the Housing
       Flight and housing support is authorized by an ISA or Letter of Agreement (LOA)
       4.2.2.2. Members of all Services assigned ID to the housing market area with no housing support
       available from their parent Service.
       4.2.2.3. Unaccompanied dependents of members serving a UDR tour meeting requirements in
       paragraph 3.6.
       4.2.2.4. Public Health Service, U.S. Coast Guard and other non-DoD federal agency members
       receiving a housing allowance.
       4.2.2.5. ARC Director.
   4.2.3. Priority 3. All other members and civilians eligible for FH but not assigned or attached to the
   installation.
   4.2.4. Priority 4. Unaccompanied dependents of members (except members on a UDR tour), foreign
   liaison and SAT personnel.

4.3. Managing Waiting Lists. The DoD premise is each family member (dependent, exclusive of
spouse), is assigned a bedroom if existing housing inventory permits; otherwise, determine housing
requirement by grade, family size and composition, but do not place a member on more than one waiting
list. Display a current waiting list in the Housing Flight for public viewing, as well as other locations
accessible at other than normal duty hours.
   4.3.1. Determine appropriate bedroom entitlement based on the member's grade and family composi-
   tion (Table 4.1., Table 4.2. and Table 4.3.). Use the table that provides the most bedrooms unless the
   member voluntarily accepts less.
   4.3.2. Members may voluntarily apply for and be assigned FH that has one bedroom less than their
   entitlement, if such housing exists in their grade category.
       4.3.2.1. No more than two dependent children may be assigned to a bedroom unless the Com-
       mander certifies in writing one bedroom can accommodate more (DoDM 4165.63). Members
       who voluntarily occupy housing with fewer bedrooms than their entitlement may apply for larger
38                                                       AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007


        housing immediately after assignment. The application date will be as a walk-in or the original
        effective date if the member applied within 30 days of PCS arrival. The member pays for a subse-
        quent move into larger housing.
     4.3.3. Members occupying FH and gaining an entitlement within 12 months, such as an increase in
     number of dependents, maturation of children or promotion, may apply for housing and be placed on
     the waiting list. The effective date of application is when the member walks into the Housing Flight.
     Housing is not assigned until the event occurs unless the waiting list is exhausted or the installation
     has adequate excess housing. The member pays for the move except as provided for in paragraph
     11.10.1.1.
     4.3.4. Members on the waiting list should notify the Housing Flight when there is a change in their
     housing entitlement, including promotion, demotion, divorce, remarriage, gain in dependents, depen-
     dents no longer residing with member or member no longer residing with dependents. When category
     of housing or bedroom entitlement changes, the member may transfer to a new waiting list using the
     same date of application from which the waiting list member transferred.
     4.3.5. Except for the assignment of K&E personnel and hardship cases, the top 10 percent of each
     waiting list is protected from bumping (freeze zone).
     4.3.6. A mil-to-mil member assigned to the installation may remain on the waiting list for up to 3
     months awaiting approval of joint spouse assignment, but must be removed from the waiting list if the
     joint spouse does not join the member at the gaining installation (paragraph 3.3.2.).
     4.3.7. Members accepting a written commitment for assignment to housing are removed from the
     waiting list and the commitment is honored.
     4.3.8. Maintain senior and general officer (O-6 to O-10) waiting lists in the following order using the
     date of rank as the effective date of application in ACES:


             Grade
             Date of Rank (DOR)
             Length of service
             Date of birth

     4.3.9. Maintain other grades, including field grade (O-4 to O-5), company grade (O-1 to O-3 and W-1
     to W-4), chief master sergeants (E-9), senior NCO (E-7 to E-8) and enlisted (E-1 to E-6), in the fol-
     lowing order:


             Priority
             Effective date of application
             Grade
             Date of Rank (DOR)
             Length of service
             Date of birth

     4.3.10. Consider community housing as the primary source of housing for a FH applicant with more
     dependents than can be suitably housed in available on-base housing using Table 4.1., Table 4.2. and
     Table 4.3.. Consider exceptions on a case-by-case basis for a K&E member when the local commu-
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                   39


   nity cannot support the housing requirement. For K&E personnel, the Commander may consider tem-
   porarily converting two adjoining housing units into one large unit or approving a waiver to allow
   more than two children to share a bedroom.
   4.3.11. Exhausted Waiting List. When a waiting list for a specific bedroom requirement within a cat-
   egory of housing is exhausted and there are no eligible applicants, the projected vacancy is offered to
   other members according to the priorities below. The most urgent housing need determines whether
   the vacancy is offered to a lower or higher category:
      4.3.11.1. Members on the waiting list in the same category that are eligible for the next higher,
      then lower, bedroom requirement.
      4.3.11.2. Members on the waiting list in the next higher, then lower category, which are eligible
      for the same bedroom requirements.
      4.3.11.3. Members on the waiting list in the next higher, then lower, category and bedroom
      requirements.
      4.3.11.4. Other members according to priorities in paragraph 4.2.

NOTES:
           1. The terms dependent and family member are synonymous. See Attachment 1 for depen-
              dent, fully defined.
           2. Assign one bedroom to member or member with spouse. Dependent family members
              married to each other (dependent parents of member or member’s spouse) are entitled to
              one bedroom.
           3. If inventory permits, assign one child per bedroom.
           4. No child may share a bedroom with parents.
           5. No more than two children may share a bedroom, except with commander approval (para-
              graphs 4.3.2.1. and 4.3.11.).
           6. A child 6 years or older may not share a bedroom with a child of the opposite sex.
           7. Children over 10 years old may not share a bedroom.

4.4. Housing Availability. Within 2-3 workdays of receiving an advance application for housing, for-
ward ACES-generated DD Form 1747 or locally produced fact sheet to the member outlining the housing
status at the gaining base. Commanders may incorporate procedures into the installation in-and-out pro-
42                                                        AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007


cessing process to make sure applicants promptly report to the Housing Flight, a requirement also stated
on members PCS orders.

4.5. Assignment to Family Housing (FH). Do not use or assign FH identified on real property records
as temporary housing. Use ACES and the ACES-generated AF IMT 1326, Change of Occupancy
Report, to record and track offers, refusals and assignments. Offer the first available uncommitted house
to the first eligible member on the waiting list and physically present at the installation. If reasonable
attempts fail to contact the member, make the offer to the next member on the waiting list. The assign-
ment is complete when the member accepts keys for the housing unit. Unless the installation has excess
housing (see Attachment 1 for definition), do not assign FH to members with less than 6 months retain-
ability at the installation. Do not assign housing until the member is present for duty and is accompanied
or will be joined by family members within 30 days (dependent college students excepted) at the installa-
tion, except for families of members on UDR assignment and base closure transition personnel and family
members authorized by paragraph 3.3.3. Make offer and obtain acceptance in writing.
     4.5.1. Give member a minimum 30-day advance notice of assignment to FH to allow time to notify
     landlord of their intent to move. If a 30-day notice is not possible because of a short-notice PCS
     assignment of current occupant, consider the following options, depending on local conditions:
        4.5.1.1. Hold the unit vacant up to 30 days for the first member on the waiting list who is physi-
        cally present at the installation and has accepted the housing.
        4.5.1.2. Offer a unit to applicants on the waiting list, in succession, until the unit is accepted.
     4.5.2. Members may exercise a turndown option for any reason and a turndown is assessed. Bypass
     members on the waiting list who do not accept the offer for reasons beyond their control (fulfill a lease
     commitment or when given a short notice of housing availability) and do not assess a turndown. For
     members under lease, do not bypass more than 1 year or the term of the lease, whichever occurs first.
     This bypassing provision does not apply to personal situations, such as a home sale. To ensure com-
     pliance and maintain program integrity, the Housing Flight Chief must review documentation to sup-
     port bypassing member.
        4.5.2.1. Except for incumbents of K&E positions, personnel with approved hardships and person-
        nel on TLA, members may exercise their option to turn down a FH unit. A member is given 1
        duty day to accept or decline the unit. Apply the following rules to turndown options:
            4.5.2.1.1. Offer the unit to the next member on the waiting list.
            4.5.2.1.2. Do not remove members from the waiting list when exercising their turndown
            option for the first time.
            4.5.2.1.3. Remove members from the waiting list when they refuse housing the second time
            and do not allow them to reapply for 90 days unless the waiting list is exhausted.
     4.5.3. Members who relocate from one on-base FH unit to another at the same installation must com-
     plete the move within 5 duty days.
     4.5.4. Record assignments in ACES and on printed version of ACES-generated AF IMT 1326 and
     complete the following applicable forms at the time of occupancy and maintain in the resident housing
     folder:

           (voluntary by member)

4.6. Assignment Priorities. Assign when member has at least 6 months retainability at the installation.
Assign eligible members and their dependents from the top of the waiting list (freeze zone) in descending
order to adequate housing according to the following priorities:
   4.6.1. Personnel in Designated Positions. Give precedence to incumbents of SCPs, Command and
   K&E positions and place at the top of the waiting list including the freeze zone without displacing
   members with a firm housing commitment (paragraph 2.20.).
   4.6.2. Personnel With Approved Hardship. With written approval from the Commander, assign hous-
   ing as an out-of-turn assignment for hardship conditions. Assign member to the next uncommitted
   unit in the appropriate grade and bedroom category to satisfy the requirement and do not allow a turn-
   down option. Only the Commander or delegated representative may approve hardship requests (para-
   graph 1.6.9.2.).
   4.6.3. Members Assigned or Attached for Duty at the Installation. This priority includes eligible per-
   sonnel assigned to units, organizations and detachments or any Service personnel such as recruiters
   and Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC), who are:
       4.6.3.1. Located on or attached to the installation for housing support.
       4.6.3.2. Located in the vicinity or within commuting distance of the installation, when an ISA
       includes housing support with the host installation. NOTE: When an AF installation provides
       housing support to another Service, AF housing policy takes precedence over other Service policy.
       4.6.3.3. ID Member assigned duty away from a military area where the parent Service cannot rea-
       sonably provide support facilities (such as housing). The installation with FH nearest the ID site
       provides FH, unless another installation within commuting distance (either 60 minutes or 20
       miles) consents to a transfer of the responsibility.

4.7. Foreign OCONUS Mandatory Assignments. AF policy is to rely on local communities first to
provide adequate housing; however, installation commanders at foreign OCONUS locations only may
require personnel to live in on-base housing for force protection and mission essential purposes. To avoid
underutilizing government-controlled housing, the Commander may also institute mandatory assignments
for a 6-month period for the following housing categories:
   4.7.1. Long-Term Leased Units. If mandatory assignments do not achieve the AF occupancy goal of
   98 percent within 6 months, renegotiate the lease based on current housing requirements and divest
   underutilized units through attrition.
   4.7.2. Government Housing Provided by Host Nation. Review historical occupancy rates and deter-
   mine an appropriate occupancy rate based on current housing requirements. If mandatory assignment
44                                                      AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007


     does not achieve the revised occupancy rate within 6 months, develop a strategy to divest underuti-
     lized housing.

4.8. Personal Preference Options. When a wide variance in style, type, location, age or design of ade-
quate housing exists, the Commander may permit personal preference options for the type of FH member
desires. Offer members housing consistent with their recorded preference. Offer members expressing no
housing preference any house that becomes available for assignment consistent with their grade and fam-
ily composition. Guidance follows for this option:
     4.8.1. The Housing Flight Chief recommends type and extent of personal preference options for
     Commander approval.
        4.8.1.1. (Added-354FW) Personnel may express a preference for housing as indicated below:
        4.8.1.2. (Added-354FW) Field Grade Officers – Moose Lake Estates (excluding ranch style
        units)
        4.8.1.3. (Added-354FW) Company Grade Officers – Moose Lake Estates (excluding ranch style
        units)
        4.8.1.4. (Added-354FW) Senior NCOs – French Creek Subdivision (excluding ranch style units,
        and Broadway Housing)
        4.8.1.5. (Added-354FW) Junior Enlisted – French Creek Subdivision (excluding ranch style
        units, Rainbow Court and Century Park Subdivisions)
     4.8.2. Record approved options in a base supplement to this AFI.
     4.8.3. Members may exercise this option when they apply for FH or when they arrive at the installa-
     tion and may change their preference at any time. Although a preference may not be changed in lieu
     of a turndown, members with an assessed turndown may change their options before being offered a
     second FH unit.
     4.8.4. Administer personal preference options within existing waiting list policies and do not estab-
     lish a separate waiting list to accommodate this provision. Update ACES with approved options and
     maintain option preferences on each member in ACES. Members with a preference remain on the
     waiting list and are bypassed until a FH unit meeting their preference is available. Members exercis-
     ing this option are not notified of other available housing, except members receiving TLA are notified
     because they are required to accept available adequate housing or forfeit their TLA.
     4.8.5. The Commander should consider discontinuing personal preference options when occupancy
     rates drop below the AF goal of 98 percent, except if the low occupancy rate is related to assignment
     to surplus housing.

                                                Chapter 5

                                 HOUSING CIVILIAN PERSONNEL

5.1. Authority. Commanders may provide housing to eligible civilian employees when one of the fol-
lowing criteria is met:
   5.1.1. When civilian employees are K&E and are required to live on base as a condition of employ-
   ment (5 U.S.C. 5911, 5 U.S.C. 5912 and OMB Circular A-45) and the position is identified in a base
   supplement to this AFI.
   5.1.2. In OCONUS areas when appropriate and adequate housing, support services and facilities do
   not exist, are not readily available in the local community or may not be used without restrictions
   (DoDD 1400.6).
   5.1.3. When housing is excess to the needs of military personnel assigned or attached to the installa-
   tion or to an adjacent installation (5 U.S.C. 5911).

5.2. Eligibility. Establish procedures with the local civilian personnel flight (CPF) to verify civilian
employee eligibility. Except for K&E civilians, occupancy of FH is limited to 5 consecutive years at any
location. When both spouses are DoD employees at the same or adjacent installations and both are eligi-
ble for FH, they jointly decide whose eligibility to use but are not eligible for FH at both installations.
Refer to Table 5.1. for a comparison of military and civilian grades.

5.3. Pro Rata Distribution:
   5.3.1. Pro rata distribution is based on total population of eligible military and civilian personnel,
   without regard to housing categories or size of the units (number of bedrooms) required. Count civil-
   ians residing in housing regardless of how long they have resided in housing. However, do not count
   civilians as eligible if they have terminated housing as a result of the 5-year rule or if they have been
   served notice of termination as a result of the 5-year rule but are in housing pending relocation. Use
   the following formula for computing the pro rata share:


                        Eligible Civilians               × Housing Assets = Pro rata Share
                Total Eligible (Military and Civilian)

   5.3.2. To determine the number of housing assets exclude FH units designated for SCP, command and
   K&E positions and exclude the incumbents from the total personnel count.

5.4. Termination. When there is a waiting list, issue 60-day mandatory termination notices to civilians
who have occupied housing for over 5 years (except K&E personnel). When local community housing is
adequate and sufficient to house civilians, at the Commander’s discretion, issue termination notices to
civilians who have occupied FH 5 years or longer. When directed, the move is at government expense.

5.5. Rental Charges. See paragraph 11.8. for reimbursing the MFH account.
   5.5.1. A civilian employee occupying FH in CONUS (includes Alaska and Hawaii) is required to pay
   a fair market rental rate, including heat, electricity, fuel, furniture and other services provided (5
46                                                        AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007


     U.S.C. 5911 and OMB Circular A-45). OMB Circular A-45 contains the specific processes to deter-
     mine fair market value, which is usually done by the Corps of Engineers.
     5.5.2. In OCONUS locations, civilian employees pay a rental charge equal to the housing allowance
     for a DoD civilian employee of equivalent grade (Table 5.2.). US civilian employees entitled to LQA
     may occupy housing instead of receiving LQA. Housing management sends a written notice to the
     servicing CPF to start or stop LQA when civilian employees are assigned or terminate government
     housing. Where the AF serves as the executive agent for housing, the published Department of State
     LQA for civilians will be charged for any civilian electing to reside in OCONUS FH, including appro-
     priated and nonappropriated personnel, Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) and bank
     employees, as well as other U.S. Government civil service personnel.

5.6. Household Goods (HHG) Storage. Unless authorized and funded by the employing organization,
do not authorize government-paid HHG storage incidental to civilians occupying government housing.

5.7. American Red Cross (ARC) Positions. ARC positions include the Regional Manager, Senior Sta-
tion Manager, Station Manager and Assistant Manager. The Commander may assign FH under the fol-
lowing conditions:
     5.7.1. In CONUS and nonforeign OCONUS, ARC personnel pay a rental rate as specified in para-
     graphs 5.5.1. and 5.5.2.
     5.7.2. In OCONUS, ARC personnel listed in Table 5.1. may be assigned housing on a rent-free basis.
     All other ARC personnel pay a rental charge equal to LQA of equivalent DoD civilian employees.

5.8. Contractor Employees and Technical Representatives. These employees are not authorized to
reside in FH unless designated K&E. MAJCOMs may approve exceptions. If allowed to reside in FH,
contractor employees and contract technical representatives pay rental rates as specified in paragraph 5.5.
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                47


5.9. Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) Employees. AAFES employees in OCONUS
locations are authorized to reside in FH on the same basis as DoD civilian employees and must pay a
rental rate as specified in paragraph 5.5.

5.10. Bank Employees. MAJCOM commanders may authorize US citizen employees of banks located
on foreign OCONUS installations to occupy FH on a rental basis as specified in paragraph 5.5., provided
the bank employee is designated K&E or suitable private housing and community support facilities are
not available.

                                                Chapter 6

                                  RETENTION AND TERMINATION

6.1. Retention of Assigned Housing. The Air Force intent is that eligible members keep housing for the
duration of their tour at the installation unless there are reasons that justify reassignment or termination.
Requests to retain FH are submitted in writing with supporting documentation to the Commander through
the Housing Flight Chief. If the Commander has delegated approval authority, the Housing Flight Chief
may approve retention requests. Disapproval authority is the responsibility of the Commander, but may
be delegated to mission support or equivalent level group commander (paragraph 1.6.9.). Members and
their families are usually allowed to retain FH for longer than normal occupancy periods under the follow-
ing conditions:
     6.1.1. Member in Missing Status. Dependent of a member who is officially reported in missing status
     (includes members who are captured, interned and involuntarily detained foreign OCONUS) are per-
     mitted to retain housing for up to 12 months. The member’s BAH is forfeited during occupancy of
     dependent.
     6.1.2. Member Incarcerated (Jailed or Imprisoned). Dependents may request to retain housing when
     the member is entitled to BAH/OHA during the period of incarceration. The Commander determines
     approval and the retention period.
     6.1.3. TDY. A member may retain housing at the home station while on TDY for duty or training.
     6.1.4. PCS With TDY En Route (does not apply to OCONUS areas). Member may retain housing
     during period of a TDY while attending Service or training school (PCS) for a period of 1 year or less
     until dependents commence travel on member's PCS orders.
     6.1.5. PCS From CONUS to Accompanied OCONUS Tour. If concurrent travel of dependents is dis-
     approved and the anticipated travel delay for dependents is less than 20 weeks, dependents may retain
     housing for 20 weeks after member departs. NOTE: Member must agree to serve an accompanied
     tour and apply for command sponsorship for dependents to travel to the new duty station.
     6.1.6. Transfer to Hospital. A hospitalized member may retain FH for the period of hospitalization or
     a period agreed on by the Commander, the Installation Surgeon General and Housing Flight Chief.
     6.1.7. Member Dies While on Active Duty. Dependents of a member who dies on active duty, who
     occupy adequate FH other than on a rental basis, on the date of the member’s death, may retain hous-
     ing without charge for a period of 365 days (37 U.S.C. 403).
        6.1.7.1. The Commander may extend occupancy beyond 365 days on a case-by-case basis, but
        dependents must pay a rental charge equal to the equivalent BAH of member.
     6.1.8. Completion of School Term. Commanders may approve retention of housing for dependent to
     complete a school term for student to graduate or if student would lose credit if required to withdraw
     or transfer (paragraph 6.3.8.).
     6.1.9. Dependents Unable to Accompany Sponsor Due to Medical or School Delay. Dependents
     denied travel to an accompanied foreign OCONUS area due to lack of medical or school facilities in
     the foreign OCONUS location may retain FH for a period determined by the Commander. Member
     requests approval on AF IMT 1466, Family Member’s Medical and Education Clearance for
     Travel.
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                  49


   6.1.10. Educational Leave of Absence Program (ELAP). While enrolled in ELAP members may
   retain FH on a space available basis (paragraph 2.28.).
   6.1.11. Unaccompanied Families. Dependents of member assigned to a UDR, home-basing tour or
   follow-on assignment who occupy government FH including leased units when the sponsor departs,
   may retain housing until the sponsor returns or reports to the next PDS. Commanders may approve
   extended retention when the sponsor extends their UDR tour. FH is terminated within 60 days of
   member’s return from the UDR location. This provision includes mil-to-mil members with no depen-
   dents. The Commander may also encourage residents to retain FH for the duration of the sponsor’s
   UDR tour.

6.2. Retention for Hardships. Commanders may approve a written request for housing retention to
relieve hardship (defined in Attachment 1).
   6.2.1. Commanders may permit members or dependents to retain FH based on hardship for periods
   shown in Table 6.1. and may extend the periods on a case-by-case basis. The occupant must pay rent
   as stated in Table 6.1. This does not apply to transition assistance benefit. As provided in 10 U.S.C.
   1147, transition benefits may not continue more than 365 days after the date of separation.

*See Attachment 1, Terms, for hardship.

6.3. Termination of Family Housing (FH). Military members may voluntarily terminate FH for any
reason after completing a mandatory 1-year tenancy. Members terminating FH give the Housing Flight at
least 40 days notice and must terminate occupancy of FH under the following circumstances. Refer to
Chapter 11 for moves funded by the government and moves for which the member is responsible:
   6.3.1. Waiver to Mandatory Residency. Commanders may waive the 1-year mandatory residency
   requirement when in the best interest of the Air Force or when a hardship exists. Waiver approval
   may be delegated to the BCE or Housing Flight Chief. Disapproval may be delegated to mission sup-
   port or equivalent level group commander (paragraph 1.6.).

     6.3.2. PCS. A member who receives PCS orders to another installation must terminate housing
     before departing, except those with authorized retention.
     6.3.3. Enlisted Member Commissioned as an Officer. An enlisted member who accepts a commis-
     sion and active duty, with no interruption of active Military Service, relocates to officer housing
     unless the member has less than 6 months retainability at the installation. Move will be at government
     expense.
     6.3.4. Commissioned Officer Who Remains on Active Duty in Enlisted Status. A commissioned
     officer who is separated and re-enlists or who assumes an enlisted grade relocates to enlisted housing
     unless the member has less than 6 months retainability at the installation. Move will be at government
     expense.
     6.3.5. Family Separation. When a member no longer lives with dependents or dependents no longer
     live with the member, the member must terminate housing within 30 days from date of separation.
     Move is at government expense, but PDLA is not payable (JFTR, U5630B, and paragraph 11.7.).
     6.3.6. Adverse Conduct or Behavior. Commanders may require a member to terminate FH with 30
     days notice when member or dependent’s conduct or behavior is contrary to accepted standards or
     adverse to military discipline. Fully document and retain the termination notice on file for a minimum
     of 1 year. Move is at government expense, but PDLA is not payable (JFTR, U5630B).
        6.3.6.1. When the member fails to comply with the AF family child care policies, the Commander
        may terminate the member’s housing privileges. Move is at government expense, but PDLA is
        not payable (JFTR, U5630B).
     6.3.7. Destruction or Abuse of Property. Commanders may terminate FH with a 30-day notice when
     the member or dependents are responsible for willful, malicious or negligent abuse or destruction of
     property. Fully document and retain termination on file for a minimum of 1 year. Move is at govern-
     ment expense, but PDLA is not payable (JFTR, U5630B).
     6.3.8. Separation or Retirement. A member who is separating or retiring must terminate housing no
     later than the date of separation or retirement from active duty. The Housing Flight Chief (with dele-
     gated approval authority) may approve retention of 60 days to relieve a hardship that occurs after
     member applies for separation or retirement when conditions are beyond their control (provision in
     paragraph 6.1.8. excepted). MAJCOM approval is required for extensions beyond the 60 days. Sep-
     arated and retired members must pay a daily rental charge equal to one-thirtieth of the combined BAH
     or OHA. Rental fees may not be waived.
     6.3.9. Death of Qualifying Dependent. Members terminate FH within 90 days following the death of
     a family member who qualified them for BAH at the with-dependent rate. The Commander may
     approve retention beyond the 90 days.

6.4. Termination Procedures. Members should give at least 40 days advance notice of intent to termi-
nate FH upon PCS, separation or retirement. The following procedures apply:
     6.4.1. The occupant provides one copy of PCS, separation, retirement, or other orders to housing
     management.
     6.4.2. Use ACES to manage terminations, generate AF Form 594, Application to Start, Stop or
     Change Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ) or Dependency Redetermination, establish
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                    51


   required inspections and track results. AF IMT 1326 documents termination milestones, which
   enables monthly reconciliation of ACES data.
   6.4.3. When the occupant has met clearance requirements and settled property accounts promptly
   relieve the resident of responsibility and terminate the housing assignment.
   6.4.4. Prepare AF Form 594 to notify the FSO of a change in housing status. The member's BAH or
   OHA is reinstated upon satisfactorily clearing FH or physical departure from the PDS, whichever
   occurs first. Failure to provide appropriate advance notice of termination of housing may affect mem-
   ber’s BAH start date (DoDR 7000.14, Volume 7A, Chapter 26, Table 26-6, Date to Start BAH - Mem-
   bers w/Dependents).
   6.4.5. DoD Civilians. Issue a dated and signed clearance document as evidence of housing termina-
   tion. Provide one copy of the termination document to the FSO and the servicing CPF, as appropriate.

6.5. Involuntary Relocation Between Housing Units. When involuntary relocations are required to
complete emergency repairs and major renovation projects, the Commander directs residents to relocate
to other FH or to community housing. Unless compelling circumstances exist, do not involuntarily relo-
cate residents for redesignation or redistribution of FH. Instead, redistribute housing vacated by normal
attrition. When occupants are directed to relocate, offer the next available uncommitted unit appropriate
for their grade and family size and no turndown option is allowed. The move is at government expense
(paragraph 11.10.).

6.6. Family Housing (FH) Inspections. The three inspections associated with the occupancy of FH are
the initial, pretermination and final. The member and a housing inspector jointly perform inspections.
The inspector and the occupant sign and retain a copy of AF IMT 227 and AF IMT 228 if govern-
ment-owned furniture is provided. Accomplish inspections as follows:
   6.6.1. Initial Inspection. Perform the initial inspection in the housing unit, when possible, at time of
   occupancy or as soon as possible thereafter. Record the condition of the FH unit, furnishings, equip-
   ment, appliances and grounds on AF IMT 227, and AF IMT 228 if applicable, according to instruc-
   tions on the reverse of the form. Advise new residents that if the condition of the housing unit,
   appliances, equipment and government furnishings differ from the entries recorded on the AF IMT
   227, the resident must submit the discrepancies in writing to the Housing Flight within 15 days of the
   move-in date to preclude an assumption of occupant damage. Complete AF IMT 3505 during the ini-
   tial inspection. Brief residents on issues, such as, but not limited to:
52                                                       AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007



            - Installation housing brochure (provide copy)
            - Appliances and mechanical systems
            - Minor M&R, such as changing light bulbs, replacing heat/air conditioner (AC)
            filters, securing door stops, replacing sink stoppers, cleaning stove burners,
            plunging toilets/sinks and basic insect control
            - Cleaning standards (reverse of AF IMT 227)
            - Grounds care
            - Self-Help Program and Self-Help Store
            - Refuse and recycle
            - Telephone numbers for emergencies and local services
            - Environmental hazards, as applicable (lead-based paint, mold, asbestos, radon)

     6.6.2. Pretermination Inspection. Perform the pretermination inspection 30-45 days before the resi-
     dent vacates FH to facilitate scheduling COM and other repairs. Compare the condition of the unit to
     the initial inspection recorded on AF IMT 227. Inform terminating residents of their responsibilities
     for damaged or missing property and how to make restitution. If the resident does not agree to repair
     or reimburse for occupant damage or if damage is over $500, request an ROS. The ROS process may
     be disregarded when the value is less than $500 and the member is willing to pay for the damage
     (paragraph 2.8.).
     6.6.3. Final Inspection. The purpose of the final inspection is to clear the member of responsibility
     for the unit.
        6.6.3.1. Use standardized cleaning requirements for all residents and make sure the resident
        accomplishes DoD-mandated cleaning listed on the reverse of AF IMT 227 (DoDM 4165-63).
        6.6.3.2. The government performs final cleaning of portions of the FH unit scheduled to be
        repaired or replaced and required cleaning not included on the reverse of AF IMT 227. The gov-
        ernment also performs final cleaning of FH units in geographical locations where TLA is autho-
        rized to reduce TLA for departing members. See AFI 65-601, Volume I, Budget Guidance and
        Procedures (Chapter 21) and AFMAN 65-604, Appropriation Symbols and Budget Codes, for
        turnover maintenance, cleaning and clearing FH units when occupants change.
        6.6.3.3. Schedule a reinspection of a failed final inspection at the earliest mutually agreed date to
        prevent disrupting the member’s scheduled departure. Do not identify new inspection items
        except obvious defects for which the member is responsible that have occurred since the most
        recent inspection.
        6.6.3.4. Arrange for a commercial contractor to clean and repair occupant damages in abandoned
        units and seek reimbursement from the member using DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment Authori-
        zation.
     6.6.4. Self-Help Work. When authorized self-help work is performed, occupants are responsible for
     returning the unit and surrounding grounds to the original configuration, unless housing management
     approves transfer of the self-help project to the next occupant. Residents may donate and the AF may
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                 53


   accept self-help improvements when workmanship and aesthetics meet acceptable construction stan-
   dards.

6.7. Customer Evaluations. Provide each customer with an AF IMT 3506 or locally developed com-
ment form to measure customer service. Request customers evaluate the service they received during the
inspection process and return the form to the Housing Flight. The Housing Flight Chief uses the feedback
to improve the inspection processes.

                                                  Chapter 7

                             REFERRAL AND RELOCATION PROGRAM

7.1. Policy. The Air Force is committed to equal opportunity and treatment for all DoD personnel seek-
ing housing, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicap and familial status and
to eliminating discrimination against DoD personnel in housing. The Housing Flight must provide eligi-
ble personnel with professional and personalized service to assist them in locating suitable, nondiscrimi-
natory community housing, recognizing:
     7.1.1. Adequate housing is required within a commuting distance of either 60 minutes or 20 miles of
     the installation.
     7.1.2. DoD personnel are entitled to an equal opportunity to reside in housing free from discrimina-
     tory practices. When a resident reports circumstances that appear suspicious of illegal discrimination,
     the Housing Flight Chief immediately initiates a review in cooperation with installation and commu-
     nity agencies (Attachment 3).

7.2. Housing Services. Offer complete referral services and a full range of relocation assistance and
monitor community housing referral and relocation activities to make sure they provide needed services,
they are free from discrimination and provide equal opportunity and treatment for all personnel.
     7.2.1. Members are free to select community or privatized housing, except where restrictive sanctions
     are imposed or when required to occupy FH. Mandatory assignment is allowed in foreign OCONUS
     locations, primarily for force protection (paragraph 4.7.).
     7.2.2. Maximize participation in the Rental Partnership Program (RPP), considering local property
     and marketing conditions. The Air Force endorses the RPP to acquire quality community housing and
     to promote formal agreements between property managers and homeowners, and the Housing Flight
     to give preferential referral to military members. The property manager or owner agrees to reduce
     out-of-pocket moving in expenses, such as deposits for damage and utilities and eliminates reference
     and credit checks. The member agrees to sign a 12-month lease and pay rental fees by allotment.
     7.2.3. The Housing Flight is the only installation agency authorized to provide housing referral and
     relocation services, including, but not limited to managing and inspecting listings for rental and listing
     for-sale-by-owner properties, counseling incoming members seeking housing and assisting with rental
     and lease agreements.
     7.2.4. At locations where AHRN is deployed, monitor the website on a daily basis. AHRN is an
     approved DoD website that provides housing rental listings and offers information on home-buying
     services from realtors. Develop a recurring schedule to inspect all properties within the commuting
     distance of either 60 minutes or 20 miles.
     7.2.5. The Housing Flight Chief actively supports installation relocation agencies, such as the Relo-
     cation Assistance Coordinating Committee (RACC), where established, and the Community Action
     Information Board (CAIB). (AFI 36-3011, Air Force Relocation Assistance Program (RAP); AFI
     90-501, Community Action Information board and Integrated Delivery System).
        7.2.5.1. As prescribed by AFI 36-3011, the Housing Flight at both the losing and gaining installa-
        tion makes sure full housing services are available, including provision for the Exception Family
        Member Program (EFMP), home finding service, counseling on home buying, selling or renting
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                      55


       and property management with emphasis on locating adequate, affordable temporary and perma-
       nent housing.
       7.2.5.2. As required, provide current comprehensive housing availability data to the RACC for
       the worldwide-automated network, Standard Installation Topic Exchange Service (SITES)
       (https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/sites/index.jsp.

7.3. Community Liaison and Data Sources. To increase available community housing, enhance related
services, maintain current information sources and strengthen support in the community, commanders and
housing management must maintain professional association with civic groups, local government and
school officials and related installation agencies.
   7.3.1. Sources include, but are not limited to the local chapter of National Apartment Association,
   property management and real estate associations, board of realtors, Federal Housing Administration
   and Veterans Administration.
   7.3.2. Maintain and monitor a wide variety of current data sources on local housing, utilities, tele-
   phone, cable, internet and other services, schools, transportation, recreation and shopping areas avail-
   able to military families to assist the member in locating housing based on family requirements.
       7.3.2.1. Recommended data are community and privatized houses, condos, apartments and
       mobile homes for rent, apartments for sharing, subletting, temporary housing, rooming houses;
       location of mobile home parks (MHP); and for-sale-by-owner housing. Sources are AHRN,
       homeowners, property managers, real estate agents, newspapers and community liaison.
   7.3.3. Communicate with property managers and homeowners to stay informed about when property
   is rented, sold or becomes otherwise unavailable and to promote AHRN as a marketing tool for rental
   property.

7.4. Promoting Housing Services. Publicize housing services on the installation website and other
installation media, commander calls, newcomer briefings and appropriate community meetings. Monitor
official and unofficial installation media advertising housing property for rent and sale. Occasionally,
post an article in official media, explaining restrictions on any installation except the Housing Flight pro-
viding housing services as a guide for those who maintain bulletin boards and publish installation news-
papers and produce other media.

7.5. Counseling and Assistance. Participate in newcomer briefings to advise members to seek counsel-
ing from the Housing Flight before negotiating a rental or lease agreement for community housing. Pro-
vide the following information and counseling:
   7.5.1. List of housing facilities with restrictive sanctions.
   7.5.2. List of rental housing, how to access to the AHRN website (www.ahrn.com), or list of
   for-sale-by-owner property. Assist member by verifying with property manager that the selected
   property is available.

        7.5.4.5. Availability of sponsor (designated by squadron commander) to provide assistance in get-
        ting settled in the community.

7.6. Homeowners Assistance Program (HAP). HAP provides assistance to eligible DoD military and
civilian personnel and eligible personnel of other Federal agencies negatively affected by BRAC actions.
The program does not cover temporary personnel employed under a time limit, NAF employees or inde-
pendent contractors and their employees.
     7.6.1. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) manages and executes the program
     www.sas.usace.army.mil/hapinv/.
     7.6.2. The Housing Flight administers the program for military and civilian personnel assigned to
     installation housing and assists homeowners prepare DD Form 1607, Application for Homeowner
     Assistance, if required. The base legal office provides legal guidance to other staff agencies and
     assistance to individual claimants.

7.7. Dispute Resolution. Investigate and mediate community housing complaints submitted by the
member. The initial complaint may be verbal but must be subsequently submitted in writing. Collect
information from each party and evaluate issues objectively. Include monetary savings to member or
landlord because of mediation. Keep a complete record of the complaint and resolution.

7.8. Community Housing Discrimination. The Housing Flight, military equal opportunity, JA, public
affairs and military and civilian personnel flights must maintain open and professional relationships to
effectively respond to and assist personnel who report suspected discrimination during their housing
search.
     7.8.1. DoDM 4165.63 directs that a suspected discriminatory act be investigated with or without the
     complainant filing a formal complaint. The Housing Flight investigates the housing discrimination
     complaint and prepares a report, including legal review and validation, to command officials for addi-
     tional investigation. This action complies with DoDI 1100.16, Equal Opportunity In Off-Base Hous-
     ing, and DoDD 1020.1, Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Handicap in Programs and Activities
     Assisted or Conducted by the Department of Defense.
        7.8.1.1. The Housing Flight maintains a listing of property agents and facilities against which the
        Commander has imposed restrictive sanctions. Restrictive sanctions are imposed against the
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                        57


       agent, identified facility and all other facilities owned or operated by the agent for a minimum of
       180 days and continue until the agent has agreed in writing to a policy of nondiscrimination.
       7.8.1.2. When providing the restrictive sanction list to personnel seeking community housing,
       obtain a signed receipt for the list and retain the receipt in the member’s active housing file for at
       least 1 year following member’s departure from the installation.
       7.8.1.3. Personnel moving into or changing their residence within the installation commuting area
       are prohibited from entering into a rental, purchase or lease agreement with an agent of a facility
       that is under restrictive sanctions.
       7.8.1.4. Restrictive sanctions do not apply to DoD personnel residing in a facility at the time the
       restrictive sanction is imposed, or those who wish to renew or extend a rental or lease agreement
       that started before the restrictive sanctions were imposed.
       7.8.1.5. A resident may not relocate to another unit within a restricted facility without the written
       approval of the Commander.
   7.8.2. Within 3 workdays after receiving a complaint of discrimination, the Housing Flight initiates
   an inquiry. The inquiry must be detailed enough to determine if discrimination occurred. Refer to
   Attachment 3 for investigative procedures for housing discrimination.
   7.8.3. If the complainant does not locate adequate housing after a reasonable time because of discrim-
   inatory practices in the community, the Commander may approve priority assignment to FH for the
   complainant.

7.9. Community Housing Inspections. Inspect rental properties, whether listed in ACES or AHRN (as
deployment) to determine adequacy. Record inspections and applicable comments in ACES and AHRN.
Provide guidance to property managers and owners on acceptable standards for units deemed to be defi-
cient and encourage upgrades.
   7.9.1. If a current resident requests an inspection or if there is reason to question the suitability of the
   housing based on environmental, health or safety considerations, seek permission from the landlord
   and enter the property for inspection. Remove property from viewing in AHRN and ACES that does
   not meet adequacy standards.
   7.9.2. In OCONUS areas where rental property standards differ significantly from the US inspect all
   rental properties before listing or occupancy, as required, for protection of members.
   7.9.3. Air Force Joint Instruction (AFJI) 31-213, Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Boards and
   Off-Installation Liaison and Operations, provides guidance on placing a housing facility off-limits for
   such reasons as safety, health or morale (as distinguished from imposing restrictive sanctions for dis-
   criminatory practices).

7.10. Standards of Conduct. Familiarize military and civilian Housing Flight employees with DoDR
5500.7, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER), and advise the employees to make sure business associations or
financial interests are conducted without suspicion of partiality and to avoid any action, whether or not
specifically prohibited, that might result in or create the appearance of:
   7.10.1. Using public office for private gain.
   7.10.2. Giving preferential treatment to any person or business associate.

                                               Chapter 8

                       PROPERTY MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR (M&R)

8.1. Maintenance and Repair (M&R) Standards. Maintain FH units according to AF standards in The
Air Force Family Housing Guide for Planning, Programming, Design and Construction. The BCE and
Housing Flight Chief ensure AF standards through routine preventive maintenance programs, accom-
plishing M&R according to accepted engineering practices, experience and manufacturer recommenda-
tions and by fostering an attitude of home ownership among residents.
   8.1.1. Inform residents to promptly notify the service provider when the FH structure, equipment or
   fixture is defective, broken, damaged or malfunctioning, and that they must allow entry into the hous-
   ing unit for necessary repairs. Schedule routine work in occupied units with minimum disruption to
   occupants.
   8.1.2. The service provider completes urgent or emergency work within a time period consistent with
   the degree of urgency and schedules nonemergency and routine work in the most economical and effi-
   cient manner. Maintenance personnel must also take proper precautions to protect the resident’s per-
   sonal property and leave the worksite clean and orderly. To reduce disruption to the occupant,
   accomplish maintenance tasks during COM, when possible.
   8.1.3. Identify requirements to improve or replace FH units, infrastructure, playgrounds and other
   common grounds in the housing area IAW HCP priorities and accomplish the work IAW AFI 32-6002
   and program guidance letters. Inspect playgrounds annually and maintain according to standards in
   the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Publication No. 325, Handbook for Public Play-
   ground Safety.

8.2. Change of Occupancy Maintenance (COM). COM is minor M&R required to make the FH unit
ready for the next occupant. Identify repairs during the pretermination and final inspection. Since COM
costs are excluded from the $20,000 M&R limitation in FH (non-GOQs), limit COM repairs to minor
M&R, carpet and drapery cleaning and replacement, floor refinishing, interior painting and replacing fil-
ters. Maintain COM maintenance start and stop dates in ACES to ensure accuracy of the ACES-gener-
ated FH Occupancy and Utilization Report.

8.3. Maintenance and Repair (M&R). The following are examples of minor and major M&R when
performed during COM:
   8.3.1. Minor M&R:


           Interior painting
           Floor and wall repair
           Restoring ceiling and wall finishes
           Electrical and plumbing fixture repair
           Landscaping and planting trees and shrubs
60                                                         AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007


     8.3.2. Major M&R:


             Restoration or replacement of structural members in
             the original locations, such as repairing or replacing
             foundation, roof, exterior structure or wall, exterior
             painting, interior partition, electrical, plumbing,
             heating ventilations and air conditioning.

8.4. Minor Alterations. Minor alteration is construction or improvement (new) work typically per-
formed in support of an M&R project and funded with FH M&R funds (P-722). However, some circum-
stances may warrant use of minor alteration without repair. Minor alteration work installs or constructs
systems, or features that do not currently exist or changes systems, features or spaces that already exist.
Use this authority for interior and exterior work consistent with AF standards. Do not use this authority
to increase the size of any unit or increase the number of rooms in any unit.
     8.4.1. Replacement of functioning or serviceable material, system or component systems before the
     end of their useful life is classified as minor alteration. Replacement of failed or unserviceable mate-
     rials, systems or components with contemporary standard components or materials, consistent with
     local standards, is not minor alteration if justified by a life-cycle analysis. Replacement of failed or
     unserviceable materials, systems or components with an upgraded material, component or system that
     exceeds contemporary standards or local standards is classified as minor alteration. Anti-Terrorism/
     Force Protection (AT/FP) requirements supported by documented vulnerability assessments are
     excluded from minor alteration cost limits (AFI 32-6002).
     8.4.2. Examples of minor alteration work are:


             Installing new planting areas or borders which are not currently installed
             Replacing carpet with wood flooring or tile (even if the carpet is due for replacement)
             Replacing laminate countertop with an upgraded surface such as Corian or granite
             Installing new outlets and/or lighting which is not currently installed
             Replacing window air conditioning unit with ducted system

8.5. Maintenance of Common Areas. The installation maintains grounds in common areas of FH. For
individual units, installation responsibility is limited to erosion control, tree surgery, screening and overall
attractiveness except for units with an approved waiver (paragraph 2.14.1.). Use low maintenance shrub-
bery and hedges that do not require trimming.

8.6. Maintenance of Government-Installed Carpet. Clean government-installed carpet, as needed,
IAW the AFCEE carpet guide, the most current ETL and manufacturer instructions to preserve the quality
and life of the carpet (www.afcesa.af.mil) (paragraph 2.26.).
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                  61


                                               Chapter 9

                           FAMILY HOUSING (FH) REQUIREMENTS

9.1. Air Force Family Housing Master Plan (FHMP). The AF FHMP provides a corporate, require-
ments-based housing investment strategy that integrates and prioritizes traditional construction and O&M
funding with private sector financing in a single road map. The road map identifies the most cost-effec-
tive investment option for each installation (use of privatization authorities or traditional MILCON) to
meet its FH requirements consistent with congressional and OSD constraints and directives (USAF Fam-
ily Housing Guide for Planning, Programming, Design, and Construction).

9.2. Housing Requirements and Market Analysis (HRMA). DoD requires the local community to be
the first source for satisfying housing requirements of military families. DoD requires Military Services
to determine requirements based on a thorough analysis of the local community’s ability to house military
families. To meet this requirement, the AF uses the HRMA. The HRMA assesses the type and amount of
community housing, including privatized housing on and off base, that satisfies DoD suitability criteria.
Housing constructed with appropriated funds or privatization authorities can be used to meet housing
demand not satisfied by the local community. The HRMA should be conducted every 3 years.

9.3. Housing Community Profile (HCP). The HCP provides a long-range plan for planning, program-
ming, design and construction of improvements, replacement and privatized FH. The HCP is key to the
Whole-House/Whole Neighborhood Program. It is the justification for housing design projects submitted
to HQ USAF/A7CH by the installation/MAJCOM. The AF has completed HCPs for all installations with
a housing inventory. Updates are accomplished approximately every 3 years, depending on the installa-
tion mission requirement. The HCP provides assessments of FH current conditions, describes actions and
associated costs to update FH to modern standards and determines the best investment decision (improve-
ment or replacement) for each installation.

9.4. Installation Family Housing Master Plan (IFHMP). The IFHMP incorporates data from the
HRMA and HCP and adjusts the HCP data to reflect the beginning of the Fiscal Year Defense Planning
(FYDP). This adjustment assumes projects programmed in years prior to the beginning of the FYDP are
complete and future investment funding requirements start with the beginning of the FYDP. The IFHMP
also documents the O&M funding requirements including operations, utilities, leases, privatization sup-
port costs and sustainment costs, including real property maintenance activities (RPMA) and real property
maintenance by contract (RPMC). All of the O&M costs, except RPMC, are based on actual housing
accounting records. The sustainment RPMC costs are estimated by the real property maintenance (RPM)
model. The RPM model uses results of the Condition Assessment Matrix (CAM) inspections conducted
to support the HCP to predict the timing and cost of major repair/replacement for housing components
and infrastructure and community systems.

9.5. Economic Analysis (EA). An EA is required for:
   9.5.1. New FH construction and replacement projects.
   9.5.2. FH support facility construction projects with a total cost of over $2,000,000.
   9.5.3. Improvement projects when the most expensive unit exceeds $50,000 ($60,000 for accessible
   handicapped units) multiplied by the local area cost factor, except foreign OCONUS locations. In for-
62                                                       AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007


     eign OCONUS locations, installations may not apply the area cost factor to increase the cost limit
     (AFI 32-6002).
     9.5.4. Prepare the EA IAW AFMAN 32-1089, Air Force Military Construction and Family Housing
     Economic Analysis Guide.
        9.5.4.1. Initiate the EA as early as practical during the project planning process and update when
        significant developments occur that would invalidate or significantly alter the conclusions. Docu-
        ment the EA to allow for complete replication, including costs traceable to their most basic input
        and unit of measure.
        9.5.4.2. Military Construction Project Data (DD Forms 1391), which are sent to OSD and Con-
        gress, must contain a summary of the EA results for the applicable project.
        9.5.4.3. The installation prepares and the MAJCOM certifies the EA. The methodology provides
        for cooperative analysis between the installation BCE and financial manager (FM), MAJCOM
        Civil Engineer and FM and HQ USAF/A7C and SAF/FM, and assures selection of the most
        cost-effective alternative.

9.6. Standards for Family Housing (FH). The goal of the Air Force is to provide its members with the
highest possible quality housing within legal limits. Congress has removed size standards for FH, includ-
ing GOQ (AFI 32-6002). Room sizes are specified in the Air Force Family Housing Guide for Planning,
Programming, Design and Construction.

9.7. Equitable Use of Housing Assets. Because changes in housing requirements reflect changes to the
base mission, force structure, population distribution and availability of community housing, Command-
ers must (each January) reevaluate the distribution of existing FH among categories in Table 4.1. to
ensure equitable allocation (paragraphs 1.6.4. and 1.8.17.).

9.8. Temporary Redistribution. The Commander considers temporary redistribution of FH when an
imbalance exists but circumstances do not warrant permanent redistribution and change of property
records. Do not use temporary redistribution when permanent redistribution is clearly warranted.
     9.8.1. The Housing Flight Chief compares current distribution of FH assets with requirements using
     ACES-HM occupancy data and submits recommendations to the Commander.
     9.8.2. Consider the following to determine the need for temporary redistribution:
        9.8.2.1. Housing requirements within each category, by number of bedrooms, including current,
        projected and programmable changes.
        9.8.2.2. Recent or projected mission changes.
        9.8.2.3. Approved and programmed new construction for government, privatized and community
        housing.
        9.8.2.4. Separation of officer and enlisted family areas.
        9.8.2.5. Imbalance of waiting times among categories.
     9.8.3. Make sure ACES reflects temporarily redistributed units by changing the current designation.
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                    63


9.9. Permanent Redistribution: Permanently redistribute FH units in ACES and on real property
records to align units with requirements when evaluation shows a significant change in the following con-
ditions (paragraph 1.6.9.7.):
   9.9.1. Base mission.
   9.9.2. Base population.
   9.9.3. Availability of government, privatized and community housing.
   9.9.4. Continued temporary redistribution to maintain equity among categories.

9.10. Conversions (Permanent Change in Use) and Diversions (Temporary Change in use). Do not
permanently convert FH identified on real property records without prior approval of SAF/IEI. Use AF
IMT 123, Request for Changed Use of Real Property, to track approval of conversions of family hous-
ing (AFI 32-9002, Use of Real Property Facilities).
   9.10.1. Converting FH to Other Uses. FH units determined to be surplus to installation requirements
   based on the current HRMA may be converted to other uses. Only convert units considered adequate
   based on the current HCP CAM score. Units considered inadequate due to functional suitability defi-
   ciencies, but otherwise adequate, may be converted. Follow guidance in AFI 32-9002 to request con-
   versions and include information outlined in Attachment 4 to justify the conversion.
       9.10.1.1. Conversions require AF real property records to be changed; therefore, determine the
       source of funds for conversion, follow-on maintenance, utilities, repair and construction work.
       9.10.1.2. Follow AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare and Recreation
       (MWR) and Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIS), for funding conversions to MWR
       and NAF activities. As part of the conversion, units must meet standards necessary for the
       end-state use and yield at least a C-2 Installation Readiness Report rating. Appropriated funds are
       used for conversions to VQs. NAF pays for conversions to TLFs. FH funds may not be used to
       pay for any conversion costs. Conversion projects must be funded within existing MAJCOM
       Total Obligation Authority. After conversion, make sure FH funds are not charged for utilities ser-
       vices to these facilities.
       9.10.1.3. If FH units are removed from the FH property records as a conversion, the appropriate
       base O&M account pays for the M&R of the converted unit.
       9.10.1.4. For surplus housing identified in the IFHMP, request permanent conversion. Exception:
       Housing for unaccompanied K&E personnel may be diverted
   9.10.2. Diverting FH to Other Uses. Divert FH units to non-FH use only when the requirement will
   not exceed 3 years. Show the date diverted and nature of the temporary use in ACES. If the expected
   use is more than 3 years, request permanent conversion. The MAJCOM Civil Engineer may approve
   diversions for UH only for up to 3 years and may delegate this authority to installation commanders.
   HQ USAF/A7C is the approval authority for all other diversions. Charge O&M costs to the FH
   account for units diverted to any non-FH use (including UH), as long as FH unit is kept on FH prop-
   erty records. Do not divert surplus units.

9.11. Surplus Housing. Units excess to the FH requirement determined by the HRMA are considered
surplus to the installation requirement. For identified surplus housing units the installation must develop
64                                                      AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007


a disposal plan using a methodical and phased approach to reduce and consolidate FH. Include govern-
ment-owned and leased and Section 801 housing.
     9.11.1. Identify surplus housing by unit type and neighborhood. Consider economic investment, con-
     dition (dispose of worst first based on CAM score), location, size and occupancy. Also, consider the
     community environment by reducing density and maintaining neighborhood continuity. Houses on
     the Historical Register and those eligible to be registered may be declared surplus.
     9.11.2. Bases must actively manage surplus unit inventory to ensure proper accountability. Annotate
     surplus units in the ACES-HM.
     9.11.3. Foreign OCONUS bases follow appropriate guidelines for disposal of FH as stipulated in the
     SOFA and other host-nation governing documents.
     9.11.4. Only two categories of surplus housing (adequate and inadequate) are possible (based on the
     CAM score) and disposition will vary for each category.
     9.11.5. OSD guidance defines the occupancy requirements necessary to retain surplus housing. Use
     a 3-year average occupancy rate (100 minus the vacancy rate as calculated by ACES) to determine the
     average occupancy rate. Calculate twice per year (1 April and 1 October) for the previous 3 years to
     account for seasonal variations. When historical ACES-HM data is not available, supplement with
     manual data.
     9.11.6. Surplus housing units are not eligible to receive programmed MILCON or programmed
     RPMC funds.
        9.11.6.1. Bases will receive no funding beyond RPMA for maintenance of surplus housing.
        M&R expenditures are limited to $3,800 per unit per fiscal year (FY). HQ USAF/A7C must
        approve per-unit expenditures in excess of this amount.
        9.11.6.2. MAJCOMs and installations track M&R costs for their surplus housing units.
        9.11.6.3. Send request to waive the $3,800 per-unit limit to HQ USAF/A7CH. Include:
            9.11.6.3.1. Unit description and type, unit address and year of construction or most recent
            whole house renovation, general construction and location.
            9.11.6.3.2. Indicate if the unit is surplus-adequate or surplus-inadequate and programmed dis-
            posal date.
            9.11.6.3.3. Description of M&R requirements that warrant supplemental funding and justifi-
            cation for repairs exceeding the $3,800 limit (storm damage, excessive wear, etc) and an esti-
            mate of total costs for the entire year. Include a detailed M&R estimate sufficient to identify
            individual components of the work. State the required start date for the M&R work and an
            estimated performance period.
            9.11.6.3.4. State whether the work is routine or emergency and impact if waiver is not
            approved.
        9.11.6.4. Use MFH O&M funding to perform RPMC level work on surplus units under emer-
        gency conditions only (affecting life, health and safety), and when no other options exist to relo-
        cate families into adequate housing.
        9.11.6.5. Adequate surplus housing may be retained as long as the 3-year average occupancy rate
        is at least 97 percent.

   9.11.7. MAJCOMs report progress to HQ USAF/A7CH quarterly (1 January, April, July, October) on
   disposing surplus FH and removing units from AF Real Property records.
       9.11.7.1. Track the following information: total housing inventory to include AF owned, priva-
       tized, leased and Section 801 leased units.
       9.11.7.2. Provide occupancy rate twice per year (April and October).
       9.11.7.3. Track the number of adequate and inadequate surplus units and the number of units
       removed from the real property records.
       9.11.7.4. Report FH units as surplus until the disposal action is complete and information is
       updated in ACES-RP (Real Property).

9.12. Disposal/Divestiture. MAJCOMs should have a program for disposal/divestiture of surplus units
(defined in the HRMA), inadequate units replaced via MILCON construction, or units conveyed as part of
a privatization initiative in the FHMP. MAJCOM Civil Engineers request approval from HQ USAF/A7C
for all MFH disposals/divestitures on a by-unit basis. See Attachment 5 for requirements for approval of
disposals/divestitures.

                                               Chapter 10

                                 FAMILY HOUSING (FH) LEASING

10.1. Leasing Authority and Criteria. Congress authorized leasing of FH under 10 U.S.C. 2828 as a
temporary measure to provide housing until permanent housing becomes available or the local commu-
nity can provide sufficient adequate and affordable housing. Specific criteria and conditions for domestic
and foreign leasing of FH units are in paragraph 10.3. and 10.4., respectively. The authority vested in the
Secretary of the Air Force to execute FH leases is redelegated to Air Force Real Property Agency
(AFRPA), IAW Secretary of the Air Force Order (SAFO) 715.4, 25 July 2002 and SAF/IEI memorandum,
13 May 2003. Leasing programs are administered at all levels within the criteria and cost limitations
established by law.
     10.1.1. Policy. The Domestic Housing Leasing Program allows the AF to lease existing privately
     owned housing in the United States, Puerto Rico and Guam for assignment as government controlled
     housing to eligible members and DoD civilian employees. The Foreign Housing Leasing Program
     allows the AF to lease existing privately owned housing or privately owned build-to-lease (BTL)
     housing, which is constructed specifically for assignment to eligible members and DoD civilian
     employees. Leased units are assigned and operated as adequate government-controlled housing.
     10.1.2. Rental Rates. For domestic leased housing, military members forfeit BAH upon occupancy.
     U.S. civilian employees pay a rental rate equal to the housing allowance for a DoD civilian employee
     of equivalent grade (Table 5.2.). For foreign-leased housing, military members forfeit their OHA and
     utilities allowance upon occupancy. U.S. civilian employees pay a rental rate equal to the housing
     allowance for a DoD civilian employee of equivalent grade (Table 5.2.).
     10.1.3. Approval Authority. Although the Congress authorized FH leasing under Title 10 U.S.C.
     2828, they retained approval authority for high-cost leases and BTL projects.
        10.1.3.1. Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment
        (ODUSD(I&E)) allocates lease points (leasing authority) among the Services and other agencies
        subject to statutory provisions and considerations of legislative intent. ODUSD(I&E) also issues
        annual cost limits per leased unit for domestic and foreign leases, which reflect the national
        median housing cost adjustments to the previous year adjusted domestic lease cost limits, and
        Consumer Price Index adjustments to foreign lease cost limits based on the unadjusted limits
        established in 10 U.S.C. 2828. Services must further adjust lease limits in foreign counties for
        currency fluctuation.
        10.1.3.2. USACE is the executive agent for domestic leasing. The Commander, USACE, pro-
        vides a service to locate, negotiate and execute domestic housing leases.
        10.1.3.3. HQ USAF/A7CH establishes management procedures, controls and reporting require-
        ments associated with the housing leasing program and allocates FH lease points to MAJCOMs
        (one point equals one leased unit). HQ USAF/A7CH also:
            10.1.3.3.1. Provides lease points to the MAJCOM for authorized units for domestic and for-
            eign leases for regular cost leases.
            10.1.3.3.2. Validates the requirement and provides lease points (authority) to the MAJCOM
            for high-cost leases.
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                  67


           10.1.3.3.3. For each new or renewal foreign high-cost lease, provides a 21-day congressional
           notification to appropriate congressional committees through the Office of the Assistant Sec-
           retary of the Air Force (Financial Management and Comptroller) (SAF/FM) following coordi-
           nation with AFRPA and approval by SAF/IEI. If Congress requires no additional information,
           the MAJCOM may finalize the lease at the expiration of the 21 calendar days. For domestic
           high-cost leases, HQ USAF/A7CH provides quarterly notification to Congress after the lease
           contract has been executed and certifies that less expensive housing units are not available.
           10.1.3.3.4. Coordinates leasing actions with AFRPA. (SAF/IEI delegated approval authority
           to AFRPA for regular cost leases.)
       10.1.3.4. MAJCOMs manage the leasing program within their command, determine require-
       ments, develop justification, comply with statutory and administrative limitations, negotiate and
       execute leases in foreign counties within authority of host nation agreements and plan and pro-
       gram for O&M of Section 801 and BTL housing.
       10.1.3.5. Installations determine requirements for leased housing and manage leases in their area
       of responsibility.

10.2. Leasing Program Administration and Approval. Use the following process to request authority
to lease housing:
   10.2.1. The Housing Flight, AFRS and Air Force Office of Assession and Training Schools
   (AFOATS) identify all lease requirements to the MAJCOM, regardless of cost.
       10.2.1.1. Apply programming benchmark size for government-owned housing to leased housing.
       If adequate leased housing within the programming benchmark size cannot be located, the MAJ-
       COM certifies the unavailability and forwards a request to exceed the limitations to HQ USAF/
       A7CH for approval. Refer to AFI 32-6002 for policies and criteria for programming, planning and
       acquiring leased units.
   10.2.2. The MAJCOM validates the lease requirement, identifies the funding source and forwards a
   request for lease authority (points) to HQ USAF/A7CH, who forwards request to AFRPA.
   10.2.3. HQ USAF/A7CH certifies the lease requirement, availability of points (authority) and funds,
   issues the required number of lease points to the MAJCOM, coordinates the request with other Air
   Staff agencies and assigns the points against the installation lease inventory. For foreign OCONUS
   high-cost leases, HQ USAF/A7CH first issues a 21-day notification package to Congress.
   10.2.4. The MAJCOM authorizes their real estate function to execute the lease contracts, following
   guidance in AFI 32-9001.
   10.2.5. Refer to paragraph 10.5. for the foreign Build-to-Lease Program.
   10.2.6. MAJCOMs with highly fluctuating requirements for leased housing, such as AFRS and
   AFOATS, have the option to request a block of lease points for domestic, regular cost leases only. If
   HQ USAF/A7CH approves the request, the MAJCOM provides a quarterly update of all leases,
   including lease identification number, city, state, rank of occupant, annual lease cost and estimated
   annual utility cost.

10.3. Domestic Leasing. FH may be leased in CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Guam when a
shortage of adequate housing exists at or near the installation. A lease contract may not be executed for
68                                                       AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007


more than 5 years (usually a 1-year contract with 4 option years). The total annual lease cost may not
exceed the statutory limits and the number of leases may not exceed the number of lease points authorized
by HQ USAF/A7CH. A government-authorized agent must identify housing units to be leased and the
request must include certification that less expensive adequate housing was not available for lease. Even
if the total lease cost is higher than member's BAH, approval requirements in paragraph 10.2. must still be
met. At least one criterion below must be met:
     10.3.1. The requirement to lease is temporary.
     10.3.2. Leasing is more cost-effective than construction or acquisition of new housing. To compare
     costs prepare an economic analysis IAW AFMAN 32-1089.
     10.3.3. FH is required for personnel attending Service schools on PCS orders.
     10.3.4. Construction of FH at the installation is authorized by law, but has not been completed.
     10.3.5. A MILCON authorization bill that includes a request to construct FH is pending congres-
     sional authorization.
     10.3.6. Housing is required in locations with housing deficits and is used only until government hous-
     ing programs or the local economy can provide sufficient housing at a reasonable cost within BAH
     rates.
     10.3.7. Fluctuating requirement where no base support is available.

10.4. Foreign Leasing. Housing units may be leased in foreign locations for DoD military and civilian
personnel and incumbents of SCPs in countries where excessive housing costs would cause an undue
hardship or in countries that prohibit leasing to individuals. Apply criteria in paragraph 10.3. and the fol-
lowing policy:
     10.4.1. A lease for FH units in foreign countries may not exceed 10 years. Leases are renewed annu-
     ally, and the cost is paid from the appropriations of the renewal year.
     10.4.2. When leasing 25 or more housing units perform an EA to determine the most effective
     method to obtain housing. Accomplish the EA IAW OMB Circular A-94, Discount Rates to be Used
     in Evaluating Time-Distributed Costs and Benefit, DoDI 7041.3, Economic Analysis for Decision
     Making, and AFI 65-501, Economic Analysis.
     10.4.3. Limit make-ready repairs, alterations and additions to work necessary to provide adequate liv-
     ing accommodations. Make-ready work is also limited to once during the life of the lease and the cost
     may not exceed 25 percent of the first year annual rent without authority from SAF/IE (DoD Manual
     4165.63).
     10.4.4. Follow guidance in paragraph 10.2. for coordinating congressional notification. Include the
     following items in the lease justification package and maintain a complete record of the documenta-
     tion for 5 years after the lease expires.
        10.4.4.1. Location of the lease by city and country.
        10.4.4.2. Identify designated position of the occupant.
        10.4.4.3. Size of unit based on family size and grade of occupant.
        10.4.4.4. Annual cost, including lease, utilities and maintenance.
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                      69


       10.4.4.5. Cost of community housing compared to the housing allowance of occupant (OHA, plus
       utilities).
       10.4.4.6. Certification that government housing is not available.
       10.4.4.7. Certification that the lease is temporary.
       10.4.4.8. Funding source.
   10.4.5. Foreign leases may be obtained through the Department of State (DoS) housing pools in areas
   where military facilities are not readily available, where there is a shortage of adequate housing in the
   area, where member is assigned to duty, and the DoS housing pool is the most cost-effective means of
   providing housing. Reimburse DoS for housing and related services furnished under the agreement;
   however, leases obtained through the DoS are considered regular leases and not a high-cost lease.
   Obtain lease points from HQ USAF/A7CH before executing DoS lease agreements (paragraph
   10.2.2.).

10.5. Foreign Build-to-Lease (BTL) Housing. BTL housing is congressionally approved and includes
leasing groups (typically 100 to 400 or more units) of existing privately owned units or built-to-lease units
for military members and eligible DoD civilians when adequate housing is not readily available. The
BTL Program allows housing to be built specifically for leasing to the Air Force. A BTL contract may not
exceed 10 years, and the annual cost for each year is paid from appropriations for that year. If leased
housing is required beyond the initial 10 years, another agreement is negotiated. Before entering into the
second agreement, as with the first, a 21-day congressional notification is required with complete justifi-
cation including an economic analysis. MAJCOMs:
   10.5.1. By memorandum, notify HQ USAF/A7CH and AFRPA of intent to pursue a BTL project,
   including scope and composition, and provide justification for proposed acquisition. The requirement
   must be supported by a HRMA not more than 3 years old.
   10.5.2. After approval by HQ USAF/A7CH develop a draft Request for Proposal (RFP), coordinate
   with the MAJCOM Civil Engineer, JA, FM, and forward two copies to HQ USAF/A7CH for review
   and coordination with SAF/GCN.
   10.5.3. After approval by HQ USAF/A7CH finalize and issue the RFP and complete the evaluation
   and selection process.
   10.5.4. Prepare the final project proposal, including the EA, contract drawings and specifications and
   a cover memorandum verifying MAJCOM Civil Engineer/JA/FM coordination and forwards to HQ
   USAF/A7CH and AFRPA for final review. HQ USAF/A7CH coordinates the proposal through HQ
   USAF/A7C, SAF/GCN, SAF/FMC and SAF/IE for approval to forward the proposal to the appropri-
   ate congressional committees for the 21-day notification. At the end of 21 calendar days, AFRPA will
   notify the MAJCOM of authority to award the project for construction.

                                               Chapter 11

                                    FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

11.1. Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH). Military personnel with dependents, as defined in 37
U.S.C. 401, are entitled to receive BAH, except when they and their dependents (or their dependents only)
occupy adequate government housing. Refer to AFI 32-6005 for housing unaccompanied personnel and
BAH eligibility.
     11.1.1. The Housing Flight prepares an ACES-generated AF Form 594 annotating the date and
     address of the housing being assigned or terminated, and forwards the AF Form 594 to the FSO for
     processing. The FSO determines dependency and BAH entitlement and enters required changes on
     the AF Form 594.
     11.1.2. BAH will commence when the member departs the losing installation pursuant to valid PCS
     orders, regardless of whether the assignment to housing has been officially terminated (CG Decision
     B-213560, 3 Apr 84).
     11.1.3. When mil-to-mil members are assigned to FH on the same or adjacent installations prepare an
     AF Form 594 for each member and send to FSO for processing. When one member arrives on station
     before the other and is eligible for housing based on other dependents, BAH terminates upon arrival
     of that member. BAH for the member arriving later terminates upon arrival. If one mil-to-mil mem-
     ber departs the installation before the other and one remains in housing, prepare AF Form 594s, iden-
     tify the date each member departs and forward to FSO for processing as the member departs.
     11.1.4. For Army, Navy and Marine Corps members, the Housing flight prepares a DD Form 137,
     Application for BAH for Members with Dependents, to notify their FSO of FH assignment or ter-
     mination. Send the DD Form 137 with a DD Form 114, Military Pay Order, to the appropriate ser-
     vice FSO. Keep one copy of these forms in suspense pending acknowledgment of receipt from the
     Service FSO.
     11.1.5. The effective date of assignment to government FH is the date the member or designated rep-
     resentative assumes responsibility or accepts keys for the housing unit, whichever occurs first.
     11.1.6. FH accepted and occupied by the member or dependents is considered adequate housing
     according to grade and family size requirements.
     11.1.7. Quarterly, the FSO initiates the BAH reconciliation with Housing to ensure members assigned
     to FH are receiving housing allowances appropriately.
        11.1.7.1. AFCESA provides ACES data to DFAS to compare with pay records. DFAS provides
        the FSO with discrepancies between the ACES data and pay records on a Family Quarters Verifi-
        cation report. FSO provides this report to the Housing Flight.
        11.1.7.2. Within 5 business days, the Housing Flight investigates the discrepancies and provides a
        copy of the original AF IMT 594 and transmittal to the FSO. If no AF IMT 594 exists in the hous-
        ing records, the Housing Flight provides a new AF IMT 594 to the FSO showing the original
        assignment date. The Housing Flight Chief assists with any further action required resulting from
        the discrepancies.
        11.1.7.3. The Housing Flight verifies that civilian personnel assigned to FH are either paying
        rental charges or forfeiting LQA, as specified in Chapter 5, Housing Civilian Personnel
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                     71


   11.1.8. When FH is not furnished for dependents, a member may occupy single-type UH that is at or
   below minimum standards for members without dependents without affecting their option to receive
   BAH at the higher rate, based on previous duty station. Housing exceeding the minimum standards
   must be (a) the only housing available, (b) not suitable for joint occupancy or (c) jointly occupied with
   other members permanently assigned to the PDS in order not to affect the members BAH. For exam-
   ple, a student could live in a dorm room and continue to draw the higher BAH rate as long as the
   above criteria are met. Dorm rooms normally would not exceed minimum standards (paragraph
   2.22.).
   11.1.9. Members are reimbursed from the installation O&M funds for lodging expenses exceeding
   BAH rates when they are temporarily displaced from FH for the convenience of the government (pro-
   grammed renovations, upgrades and emergency repairs) (Comptroller General decisions B-213293
   and B-225205; and AFI 34-206, Air Force Lodging Program).
       11.1.9.1. The member claims housing expenses exceeding the BAH entitlement on Standard
       Form (SF) 1164, Claims for Reimbursement for Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official
       Business.
       11.1.9.2. Residents may claim housing expenses exceeding the BAH entitlement for (1) the num-
       ber of days lodged in TLF and off-base contract quarters, and (2) up to the maximum allowable
       lodging rate for that locale IAW Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR), for the number of days
       lodged in off-base noncontract quarters.

11.2. Living Quarters Allowance (LQA). Housing management sends a written notice to the servicing
CPF to start or stop LQA when civilian employees are assigned to or terminate government housing.
Civilian employees occupying FH do not receive LQA payment (paragraph 5.5.).

11.3. Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA). Members in PCS status are authorized to receive TLA
upon arrival and departure in OCONUS areas (excludes Alaska). Specific circumstances, conditions and
requirements of TLA are identified in the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR), Volume 1, Uniformed
Service Members.

11.4. Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE)— An allowance to partially offset the added living expenses
incurred in CONUS by members and dependents when occupying temporary lodging incident to PCS.

11.5. Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) and Move-In Housing Allowance (MIHA). F o r O C O -
NUS areas only, individuals moving into community housing may be eligible for OHA and MIHA. Spe-
cific circumstances, conditions and requirements of OHA or MIHA are identified in the JFTR.

11.6. Dislocation Allowance (DLA). The FSO authorizes DLA for expenses incurred in relocating the
member’s household on a PCS move, moves ordered for the government’s convenience, or incident to an
evacuation. This allowance is in addition to all other allowances authorized in the JFTR and may be paid
in advance.

11.7. Partial Dislocation Allowance (PDLA). Members of all Services are entitled to a PDLA when
ordered to occupy or vacate family-type housing (37 U.S.C. 407(c) and JFTR, U5630B). PDLA is autho-
rized on an AF IMT 150, Drayage/Storage Authorization--Government Quarters, in conjunction with
72                                                      AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007


a local move but is not authorized without an approved local move. Do not pay PDLA when member is
ordered to occupy or vacate housing that is not provided by the government (U.S.C. 37, Section 407(f)).
     11.7.1. PDLA must be paid to a member ordered to occupy or vacate government family-type hous-
     ing due to privatization, renovation or for any other reason for the convenience of the government
     other than a PCS.
     11.7.2. PDLA is not authorized for local moves from FH upon separation or retirement, incident to
     PCS, for member’s convenience (including promotion and change in family size or bedroom require-
     ments), if voluntarily initiated by the member pending divorce or family separation; or due to mem-
     ber’s misconduct. PDLA is also not paid in conjunction with a local move when member is ordered
     out of FH because of family separation or divorce (11.10.1.3.).

11.8. Reimbursement to the Housing Account:
     11.8.1. All Services (including Air Force) and agencies, including U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Public
     Health Service, AAFES and banks, must reimburse the FH account when their Appropriated and Non-
     appropriated Fund civilian employees live in government-owned or government-leased housing.
     11.8.2. The Housing Flight coordinates billing and collection procedures with the appropriate FSO.
     Sponsor organizations reimburse the housing account monthly. For civilians not entitled to a housing
     allowance, collect rent locally using a DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher (paragraph 5.5.).

11.9. Disconnection and Reinstallation Charges. Reimburse member for telephone and cable recon-
nection fees when local moves are government-directed and member is not entitled to PDLA. Members
are entitled to reimbursement to restore the same service they had at their previous residence, and there is
no limit to the number of disconnection and reinstallation reimbursements. Do not authorize reimburse-
ment for disconnection and reinstallation when member is evicted by the government.

11.10. Local Drayage and Household Goods (HHG) Storage. Personnel directed to move into,
between and from government housing are entitled to a local HHG move and HHG storage at government
expense, as authorized by JFTR, Volume 1, Chapter 5, part D, paragraph U5355, section B. The Housing
Flight must stay updated with and consistently apply JFTR policy. The Housing Flight Chief, in coordi-
nation with the local traffic management office (TMO) or Joint Personal Property Shipping Office, bud-
gets and controls local drayage and storage funds (P-3400) (AF IMT 406, Miscellaneous Reimbursement
Obligation Document, and AF IMT 616, Fund Cite Authorization (FCA). Employ ACES to track and
reconcile these drayage and storage funds. Local drayage and HHG storage is authorized on ACES-gen-
erated AF IMT 150. Moves to, from or between FH units for the convenience of the member or family
are not authorized at government expense.
     11.10.1. Local Drayage. The following are government-paid moves:
        11.10.1.1. Local moves from community housing to government-owned, -leased and privatized
        housing are paid on a one-time basis after PCS. Subsequent moves from FH to community hous-
        ing or from community housing to government housing are paid only when directed by the Com-
        mander, except the Housing Flight Chief may authorize a local move from one unit on base to
        another to prevent more than two dependent children from sharing a bedroom.
        11.10.1.2. Local moves to vacate government housing scheduled for major repair or renovation.
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                          73


        11.10.1.3. Local moves from government-owned and -leased housing resulting from family sepa-
        ration or divorce are paid when member no longer lives with dependents or dependents no longer
        live with member (paragraph 6.3.5.).
    11.10.2. HHG Storage. Member is entitled to government paid storage of HHG (furniture items)
    excess to needs while occupying government-owned, -leased or privatized housing. Member sends
    request for nontemporary storage (NTS) to Housing Flight and includes an inventory of items to be
    stored. NTS is not authorized for member voluntarily vacating government housing for personal con-
    venience.
        11.10.2.1. Brief newly assigned members on NTS entitlement and that residents must request
        NTS within 30 days after housing assignment. The Housing Flight may extend the 30-day period
        as circumstances warrant. NTS entitlement excludes furnishings acquired after move-in.
        11.10.2.2. Review the inventory list to make sure items to be stored are furniture items. As
        required, advise member to contact TMO for clarification of items prohibited from government
        shipment and storage.
        11.10.2.3. At CONUS locations reassess the need for continued NTS when member moves into
        larger FH (move between units).
        11.10.2.4. Include a reminder on out-processing checklists for the member to remove NTS upon
        departure from the installation.
        11.10.2.5. Unless authorized and funded by the CPF, disapprove requests from DoD civilians for
        storage of HHG incidental to occupying government housing.

11.11. Personal Consumables, Personal Expenses and Personal Services. Do not use appropriated funds
for personal expenses, to purchase personal consumable items or to perform personal services unless spe-
cific authority is granted. Personal consumables are items such as holiday decorations, gas for portable
grills, wood for fireplaces, pet supplies and equipment. Personal services are services performed for the
sole benefit of the resident; for example, installing a personal ceiling fan or chandelier, electrical outlet for
personal equipment and equipment to accommodate pets (paragraph 2.15.).

                                                Chapter 12

                                    MOBILE HOME PARKS (MHP)

12.1. Authority and Guidance: The AF does not consider mobile homes to be suitable permanent party
housing and does not purchase or maintain mobile homes. Installations may retain MHPs, but may not
build new parks or program for major improvements to existing parks and must annually evaluate the
need for existing MHPs. The cost of M&R is computed as rental charges to residents (paragraph 12.8.).
For MHP standards, see Air Force Family Housing Guide for Planning, Programming, Design and Con-
struction.
     12.1.1. Safety Inspections. The installation BCE, safety office and medical personnel are responsible
     for safety inspections of mobile homes and spaces annually.
     12.1.2. Utility Connections (Electric, Gas, Oil, Water and Sewer). The installation BCE and mobile
     home carrier, if included in a contracted moving service, connect and disconnect utilities. The owner
     provides all materials, which must comply with installation safety criteria and standards for utility
     connections. The installation BCE inspects the connection work to ensure proper connections are
     made; corrections are at owner’s expense.
     12.1.3. Other services provided for MHPs include:


            Management
            Refuse collection and disposal
            Entomology (exterior grounds only)
            Street cleaning
            Snow removal
            M&R of streets, parking areas, mobile home pads, community
            facilities, government-owned storage sheds and common
            recreational areas

     12.1.4. Housing management maintains records of MHP business activities, and makes available for
     periodic audit. Records include:
        12.1.4.1. Licenses (original AF IMT 1505, License to Occupy Mobile Home Space) and notices
        of extension, revocation and termination.
        12.1.4.2. Transactions of rental, utility and service charges, billed and collected.
        12.1.4.3. Proof of mobile home ownership (copy of mortgage document, payment book, payment
        coupon, bill of sale or title of the unit).

12.2. Resident Responsibilities. MHP resident responsibilities are similar to FH residents, with unique
exceptions. MHP owners must:
     12.2.1. Before space acceptance, determine if the available park space can accommodate their mobile
     home, pay charges for adapting their mobile home to the available space and provide materials for
     utility connections.
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                    75


   12.2.2. Move their mobile home to the MHP, provide and install skirting, ground anchors and
   tie-down straps to protect the mobile home, awning, storage sheds and other accessories from high
   winds. A BCE-approved work clearance request (AF IMT 103) is required before installing ground
   anchors and tie downs, and ground anchors must meet state and local code.
   12.2.3. Equip their mobile home with single station, local alarm, residential-type smoke detectors
   before moving in. A smoke detector will be installed in each sleeping area and between the bedroom
   area and the rest of the mobile home. Detectors must comply with National Fire Protection Associa-
   tion Standards. Inspect smoke detectors as a part of the initial inspection to make sure they are oper-
   ational. Carbon monoxide detectors are also required for mobile homes using fossil fuel systems.
   12.2.4. Maintain their mobile home and spaces in good condition consistent with policies established
   by the Commander; within 30 days of occupying the mobile home space, provide additional screening
   or landscaping to frames and wheels; store privately owned materials and equipment inside the mobile
   home or in storage sheds, which may or may not be provided by the government. Mobile home addi-
   tions and accessories are subject to approval by the installation BCE or authorized representative,
   before they are installed.

12.3. Eligibility. MHPs are for use by military families assigned to the installation and to units attached
to the installation for housing support. Unaccompanied members may be assigned only when no mem-
bers with dependents are on the MHP waiting list. Sharing and subletting are not authorized.

12.4. Safety Requirements. Mobile homes must meet the minimum state and local health, safety and
aesthetic standards established by the Commander.

12.5. Application and Assignment. Mobile home spaces and waiting lists are managed in ACES.
Members may be placed on the waiting list pending purchase of a mobile home. However, a member at
the top of the list unable to accept an offered space is moved to the bottom of the list. A member unable
to accept assignment of a space for the second time is removed from the list for 90 days. Unless first on
the waiting list, in-place purchase of a mobile home does not automatically allow the purchaser to retain
that space. Housing management coordinates with members ahead of the purchaser on the waiting list to
allow the mobile home to remain in place. Rental mobile homes are not permitted in base MHPs.
   12.5.1. Commanders may grant and revoke licenses (AF IMT 1505) to use mobile home spaces or
   may delegate authority to housing flight chiefs. The term of a license is typically four years, but may
   need to be adjusted in the event park closure is programmed.
   12.5.2. A license establishes mobile home owner responsibilities and rights while occupying a MHP
   space. A license to occupy a MHP space may not be issued to a single military member who owns the
   mobile home with any other person. Housing management prepares the license for signature of the
   Commander or designee and the mobile home owner and maintains the original license for the dura-
   tion of occupancy.
   12.5.3. A government-funded move of a mobile home to the PCS location (private property, leased
   space or another government-owned MHP) is authorized in conjunction with a PCS move (JFTR, Part
   1). Generally, after initial arrival and setup, movement of a mobile home to or from a govern-
   ment-owned MHP within the area of the gaining installation is at no cost to the government. How-
   ever, members ordered by the Commander to vacate the MHP are entitled to a government-paid move
   to the local vicinity (JFTR, U5530, Local Moves).
76                                                      AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007


12.6. Retention. Personnel may retain their MHP space under the same conditions established for FH
(paragraph 6.1.). Members must notify housing management when their mobile home will be unoccupied
for more than 2 weeks.

12.7. Termination. Housing management uses FH terminations procedures (paragraph 6.2.). The Hous-
ing Flight Chief establishes procedures to ensure collection of departing MHP resident unpaid monthly
charges. Housing management notifies the FSO to collect monthly charges and verifies that all indebted-
ness has been paid before signing the member's base clearance. A copy of the DD Form 139 may serve as
evidence of payment.

12.8. MHP Closure. The MAJCOM and Commander make the determination to close a MHP.
     12.8.1. When the Commander announces closure of the MHP but has not ordered residents to vacate,
     a government funded move of mobile homes is authorized only in conjunction with PCS, retirement
     and separation orders to the next PDS, home of selection (HOS), home of record (HOR) or the local
     community in lieu of a HHG shipment. When the Commander issues the notice to close the MHP,
     members may sell mobile homes in place until the order to vacate is issued. New owners are entitled
     to a government-funded local move when the order to vacate is issued.
     12.8.2. Once the Commander orders residents to vacate the MHP by a specified date, members are
     authorized reimbursement for moving or are authorized a government-procured (locally issued and
     funded orders) move of their mobile home to an off-base location in the PDS vicinity. The member
     must own the mobile home when it is moved but is not required to occupy the mobile home after the
     move. If the member is ordered into government housing at the local PDS, a government-funded
     move of HHG into government housing is authorized (simultaneously or within a given period of
     time). The Commander determines a reasonable distance the mobile home can be moved based on
     local geographic conditions. Members subsequently receiving PCS, retirement or separation orders
     are authorized applicable weight allowance for HHG shipment to the next PDS, HOS or HOR.
     12.8.3. In-place sales of mobiles are not allowed after the Commander issues the order to vacate.
     Send request for waiver to this provision, with full justification, to HQ USAF/A7CH for approval.
     New owners are required to sign a statement they fully understand they are not entitled to a govern-
     ment-funded local move and they are obligated to relocate the mobile home before closure of the
     MHP.

12.9. Financial Administration. The Air Force recovers construction, improvement, M&R, operations
and utilities costs from MHP residents through space rental fees. For audit purposes, the BCE keeps
records of construction and improvements costs until the AF deactivates the MHP. The BCE also retains
records for amortizing costs until disposal of the park.
     12.9.1. In coordination with the resources flight, reassess rental fees annually based on MHP operat-
     ing costs for management, M&R, alterations, utilities and refuse collection. Members pay MHP
     rental fees by payroll deduction.
     12.9.2. Establish a rental fee to amortize the cost of construction and improvements over a 25-year
     period. The amortization period begins with completion of construction. To determine the rental fee,
     add any improvement cost to the initial MHP construction cost, divide by 300 months (25 years) and
     then by the number of spaces in the park. The requirement to amortize construction cost and subse-
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                   77


   quent improvements expires at the end of the 25-year period regardless of the occupancy rate or the
   amount of rent collected. When deactivating a MHP, do not adjust the rent of remaining residents.
   12.9.3. Calculate O&M charges for the following FY, based on the actual cumulative cost for the
   prior FY O& M costs. (Include services such as street cleaning, snow removal and refuse collection,
   as applicable). Assign a pro rata share of the costs to each MHP space. Use available contract rates
   for the new FY for service collection under Element of Expense/Investment Code (EEIC) 721.22,
   Management, 533XX.
   12.9.4. Management costs (EEIC 721.11, Management-Government Dwellings), assume that 50 per-
   cent less management effort is required for a mobile home space than for an FH unit. Use the follow-
   ing example to compute management costs for a MHP.


           The number of FH units = 1,000
           The number of MHP spaces = 100
           The annual total management cost = $190,000
           $190,000/12 months = $15,388
           $15,388/1,100 (FH units + MHP spaces) = $14.39 per month
           $14.39 X .50 = $7.19 per month management cost

   12.9.5. Charges for utilities provided by the Air Force are usually based on individually metered or
   measured consumption. When not metered, residents pay a pro rata share of the total costs for utilities
   provided to the MHP.

                  PROCESSING HOUSING DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS

A3.1. Detecting Potential Discrimination. Refusing to show, rent, lease or sell suitable housing to
potential residents may establish the basis for a potential complaint of housing discrimination. Language
that expresses or conveys discrimination or suggests discriminatory policy is considered an act or incident
of discrimination. Promptly report every incident of potential housing discrimination to the Housing
Flight Chief for action, and follow the investigative procedures in this chapter.

A3.2. Initial Inquiry Into Complaint. Within 3 workdays after receiving a complaint of discrimination,
the Housing Flight Chief or housing representative initiates an inquiry. The inquiry may be informal, but
must be detailed enough to determine if discrimination may exist, as defined in Attachment 1, Terms.
   A3.2.1. Interview the complainant promptly and document details of the circumstances surrounding
   the alleged discriminatory act.
   A3.2.2. Notify the BCE and Commander immediately.
   A3.2.3. If the complaint concerns a change in availability of a vacancy (such as just rented) and the
   Housing Flight receives notice soon after the alleged act, immediately determine whether there is an
   actual vacancy. The Commander may authorize the use of two or more verifiers. The housing repre-
   sentative may telephone or visit the agent and without referring to the complaint, try to verify the
   vacancy without alerting the agent that a complaint has been received.
   A3.2.4. To allow prospective tenants to decide if they wish to look at the facility in question, advise
   them that the Housing Flight has received a complaint of discrimination against the agent or facility,
   but that the inquiry has not yet been completed.
   A3.2.5. Advise the complainant of the following:
       A3.2.5.1. Procedures set forth in this instruction.
       A3.2.5.2. Their right to take further actions through Housing and Urban Development (HUD),
       Department of Justice (DOJ), or local or state agencies during or after the AF inquiry and without
       regard to AF results. If the complainant files a complaint with another agency and the AF inquiry
       is incomplete, do not delay the AF investigation pending the outcome of the other investigation.
       Even if the complainant declines to submit HUD Form 903, Housing Discrimination Complaint,
       the Commander is still responsible for conducting the inquiry and for taking whatever action is
       required.
   A3.2.6. Document actions and submit the results of the preliminary inquiry, including complete doc-
   umentation, to the Commander to make a determination of discrimination.
   A3.2.7. If the inquiry validates the complaint and the complainant concurs, the Commander sends the
   complaint, with supporting documents to HUD using HUD Form 903, and an information copy to
   DOJ.
   A3.2.8. Assist the complainant, as follows:
94                                                        AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007


        A3.2.8.1. Complete HUD Form 903 in seven signed, dated and notarized copies. (Recommend a
        housing staff member be a licensed notary public.) Summarize the incident in the summary of
        events on HUD Form 903, and include that statement as part of the file sent by the Commander.
        A3.2.8.2. Coordinate with the base legal office to advise the complainant on:
            A3.2.8.2.1. How the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968 apply and the
            limitations in the current situation.
            A3.2.8.2.2. The complainant’s right to file the complaint directly with HUD or DOJ, or to
            bring a private civil action in the proper local, state or Federal court.
            A3.2.8.2.3. Legal assistance available at the installation.
        A3.2.8.3. Options for obtaining suitable housing. If after a reasonable amount of time, the com-
        plainant cannot find adequate housing because of discriminatory practices in the community, the
        Commander may approve the priority assignment to FH. As a last resort, a humanitarian reassign-
        ment action may be appropriate, but must be fully justified as required by AFI 36-2706, Military
        Equal Opportunity and Treatment Program. A statement from the Commander that FH is not
        available must support the request for reassignment.

A3.3. Selecting and Using Verifiers. The Commander may authorize the use of verifiers to investigate
the complaint, as necessary. Do not use verifiers solely to determine practices and behaviors of an agent
outside the allegations of the current complaint. The following procedures apply:
     A3.3.1. Verify a vacancy as soon as possible after the discrimination is alleged.
     A3.3.2. Use volunteer verifiers, if possible, from the base social actions office and Command Chief
     Master Sergeant. Do not use housing management personnel except in an unusual situation.
     A3.3.3. Verifiers determine what characteristic (race, color, religion, sex, national origin or familial
     status) is the suspected basis for unequal treatment or for declining rental or sales to the complainant.
        A3.3.3.1. Use verifiers with the same basic characteristics as the complainant, except the charac-
        teristics that are identified in the complaint.
        A3.3.3.2. Use two verifiers, one that possesses similar characteristics to the complainant.

A3.4. Instructions to Verifiers. The Housing Flight explains the policy and procedures of Equal Oppor-
tunity in community housing and housing referral programs and emphasizes that the verifiers:
     A3.4.1. Obtain information about the operating policies, practices and procedures of the agent or
     facility that can be used to determine the validity of the complaint.
     A3.4.2. Do not make any verbal or written contract for the apartment, pay any money or express a
     commitment for facility. Instead, verifiers may say that the property does not meet their needs or they
     are looking for less expensive or larger housing. At the time of the visit, the verifier must make it
     clear to the agent they are not interested in the facility.
     A3.4.3. Know the family composition, pets and housing requirements of the complainant, so they can
     ask for identical requirements.
     A3.4.4. Obtain the following information, if possible, for inclusion in the inquiry.
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                       95


       A3.4.4.1. Facility. Which facility was available; did it meet the complainant’s requirements;
       rental amount; deposit required; are children and pets allowed; is application required; time lag
       between the application and move in date; minority families or minority singles in the facility;
       presence or absence of a vacancy sign; and other appropriate information.
       A3.4.4.2. Prospective Tenant. Qualifications requirements (such as credit rating, salary, marital
       status, race, children, deposit, written application), including all steps from initial inquiry to mov-
       ing in. Verifier’s opinion about whether the manager’s subjective impression of the applicant
       would play a part in the decision to rent an apartment?
   A3.4.5. The verifier completes statement immediately after the verification visit, and it must be accu-
   rate, objective and detailed. Include the following:
       A3.4.5.1. Date, time of visit, name and position of person contacted. Include any other pertinent
       information obtained during the visit such as length of time employed at facility and race of person
       contacted.
       A3.4.5.2. In reconstructing the conversation, write in the first person (I and we). Use direct
       quotes if possible, and give the full name of the person being quoted, and the persons to whom
       they are speaking. Do not use the pronouns, he, she or they to refer to persons quoted.
       A3.4.5.3. Verifier signs and dates the statement, gives full name, address and telephone number
       (duty and home), and provides race or other self-characteristics relevant to the complaint.

A3.5. Notice of an Informal Hearing. With three workdays of receiving the inquiry report initially sub-
stantiating the complaint, but before final determination of validity, the Commander sends a written notice
to the agent of the facility. A representative of the Commander delivers the notice to the agent personally,
or the notice is sent to the agent by certified mail with return receipt. Note: This notice explains the spe-
cific nature of the discrimination complaint and states that the agent has a right to:
   A3.5.1. Request a hearing with the Commander and to appear personally at the hearing.
   A3.5.2. Be represented by an attorney.
   A3.5.3. Present evidence and call witnesses on his or her behalf.
NOTE: After receiving the notice, the agent has 5 workdays to request a hearing. If the Commander
receives no request within that time, the right to a hearing is considered waived.

A3.6. Conducting Informal Hearing. The Commander will hold this hearing at a convenient location.
   A3.6.1. The agent, the agent’s attorney, the complainant, the complainant’s attorney, the equal oppor-
   tunity officer, housing management representative, JA or other designated persons may attend.
   A3.6.2. A summary of the hearing is prepared and placed in the complaint file. The summary should
   include who attended, location of hearing, and a summary of discussion.

A3.7. Disclosure of Information. Give copies of HUD Form 903 and other pertinent statements
required for HUD or DOJ action to the agent or agent’s attorney. The AF must not damage any potential
HUD or DOJ investigation by disclosing facts before other enforcement agencies begin their procedures.
96                                                       AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007


A3.8. Legal Review. Request a legal review for content and completeness after the inquiry and informal
hearing (if applicable), but before the Commander makes a final determination of complaint validity.
Place a statement in the file, signed by the installation JA performing the review, that the review was con-
ducted. The statement must include:
     A3.8.1. Explanatory remarks, including comments about the facts and evidence presented.
     A3.8.2. Information about other pending complaints from private parties against the same facility or
     agent.
     A3.8.3. Comments regarding how state, federal, local or foreign country civil rights legislation
     applies to the case.

A3.9. Installation Commander Determination. The Commander alone must render the determination
of discrimination, and is responsible for imposing restrictive sanctions if complaint is validated. This
responsibility may not be delegated. The Commander’s decision must be based on a full and impartial
review of facts weighed against this instruction. The Commander has the option to make further inquiry
or to close the case. If the case is closed, the steps to take vary, depending on whether the complaint was
or was not validated.

A3.10. Making a Further Inquiry. If the Commander requires more information, or further inquiry, an
AF officer is appointed from outside the Housing Flight to make a formal inquiry or investigation, as the
situation warrants. If the officer is not an attorney, the JA, EEO office and housing representative are
available to advise and assist.

A3.11. Closing the Case:
     A3.11.1. If the Commander determines that the inquiry did not validate the complaint, the case is
     closed, and:
        A3.11.1.1. The Commander advises the complainant in writing of:
            A3.11.1.1.1. Actions taken and their right to proceed with further action (submit a complaint
            to HUD and/or DOJ, or to initiate a civil action).
            A3.11.1.1.2. Availability of legal assistance from the installation JA or other legal counsel in
            pursuing a civil action.
        A3.11.1.2. The Housing Flight discontinues the action described in paragraph A3.2.4. and pre-
        pares a summary of the case for the report file.
            A3.11.1.2.1. The summary outlines the practices that gave rise to the complaint, actions and
            results of the inquiry, action of Commander to obtain relief, as well as a commitment from the
            agent of the facility about future practices.
            A3.11.1.2.2. The case file also includes the statement, completed by the complainant: I
            (am)(am not) satisfied with the efforts taken by the Commander in my behalf to achieve satis-
            factory resolution of my off-base housing discrimination complaint. If the complainant is not
            satisfied with actions or results, so state in the file.
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                     97


     A3.11.1.3. If an informal hearing was offered, the Commander notifies the agent by command
     correspondence of the inquiry results. This notification should emphasize that DoD and AF policy
     must ensure equal opportunity in community housing.
     A3.11.1.4. The Commander sends the report to the MAJCOM and other agencies as explained in
     paragraph A3.12.
  A3.11.2. If the inquiry validates the discrimination complaint, and the Commander determines the
  discriminatory act conflicts with DoD or AF policy, the following actions must be taken:
     A3.11.2.1. Impose restrictive sanctions against the agent and all properties represented by the
     agent for a minimum of 180 days or until other specific requirements in paragraph A3.15. are met.
         A3.11.2.1.1. Also, impose restrictive sanctions when an alleged discriminatory act is investi-
         gated and substantiated, even without a written complaint.
         A3.11.2.1.2. Do not withhold restrictive sanctions pending investigation of another agency
         (HUD or DOJ).
         A3.11.2.1.3. To ensure program credibility, impose restrictive sanctions promptly and cor-
         rectly once a complaint is substantiated.
     A3.11.2.2. Take the following steps in imposing restrictive sanctions:
         A3.11.2.2.1. If the facility is listed with the Housing Flight, remove the listing from the files.
         A3.11.2.2.2. Impose sanctions against all facilities owned or operated by the agent on the date
         of notification.
         A3.11.2.2.3. Revise the restrictive sanctions list to include the facility. Prepare the restrictive
         sanctions list on official letterhead stationery and send to the Commander for signature.
         A3.11.2.2.4. The Commander informs the agent, by command correspondence, that restric-
         tive sanctions have been imposed and the reasons why, explains the nature and minimum
         length of the restrictions and outlines what action is required to remove the restrictive sanc-
         tions. The notice is personally delivered to the agent by a representative of the Commander or
         is sent by certified mail with a return receipt requested.
         A3.11.2.2.5. Personnel seeking housing in the community are given a copy of the restrictive
         sanctions list, informed they may not rent, lease, purchase or reside in any of the facilities
         listed, and sign a statement verifying they received the list.
         A3.11.2.2.6. The Housing Flight sends the restrictive sanction list to the public affairs officer
         to incorporate into the appropriate internal information program.
     A3.11.2.3. The Commander informs the complainant in writing of all actions taken, and that the
     complaint receives continuing base attention. If appropriate, send a copy of this notice to agencies
     where the complaint file is being sent and repeat complainant’s right to pursue remedies in civil
     court. If the complainant has not been suitably housed, the Commander emphasizes continuing
     assistance of the Housing Flight.
     A3.11.2.4. The Commander develops a cover memorandum, analyzing the:
         A3.11.2.4.1. Impact of restrictive sanctions on the facility, DoD personnel and their depen-
         dents and the community-housing program.
98                                                        AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007


            A3.11.2.4.2. The number of facility units involved (if available).
            A3.11.2.4.3. The base efforts in locating housing for the complainant.
            A3.11.2.4.4. Other relevant considerations.
        A3.11.2.5. The Commander requires the following statement be completed by the complainant
        and placed in the case file: I (am)(am not) satisfied with the efforts taken by the Commander in my
        behalf to achieve satisfactory resolution of my off-base housing discrimination complaint. If the
        complainant is not satisfied, document the reasons in the case file.
        A3.11.2.6. The Commander sends the complaint as outlined in paragraphs A3.12.

A3.12. Submitting the Report. Timely submission of the complaint report is extremely important.
Complete the inquiry or investigation and administrative actions within 35 calendar days after the com-
plaint is received.
     A3.12.1. Interim Report. If an inquiry requires more than 35 days, the Commander sends an interim
     report to the MAJCOM Civil Engineer
        A3.12.1.1. The interim report may be in narrative format, with details presented in chronological
        order, or it may be sent as a case file.
        A3.12.1.2. The MAJCOM monitors the action taken on the complaint to make sure correct proce-
        dures are followed in the investigation, the base is responding affirmatively to the complaint, and
        the base expedites the process.
     A3.12.2. Unsubstantiated Complaints. If the complaint is not validated by the investigation, the
     Commander sends a copy of the case file to the MAJCOM for information and review.
        A3.12.2.1. As a minimum, include a chronology of events, a copy of the complaint; the inquiry
        report; all of the supporting documents; the legal review; the Commander’s memorandum; the
        complainant’s statement; and any other correspondence regarding the complaint, including the
        interim report (if any).
        A3.12.2.2. Maintain files at the installation and MAJCOM for at least 24 months. Typically,
        unsubstantiated complaints are not forwarded to HQ USAF/A7CH.
     A3.12.3. Substantiated Complaints. If the complaint is validated, the Commander sends five copies
     of the complete files to the MAJCOM.
        A3.12.3.1. As a minimum, the file includes a chronology of events, complaint, inquiry report,
        supporting documents, informal hearing correspondence and summary, legal review, Com-
        mander’s memorandum, complainant’s statement, correspondence about the complaint and an
        interim report (if any).
        A3.12.3.2. Within 20 days of the date the case is forwarded from the installation, the MAJCOM
        reviews and sends four copies of substantiated case files and pertinent MAJCOM correspondence
        and a MAJCOM legal review, to HQ USAF/A7CH. If necessary, the MAJCOM promptly returns
        the case to the installation for corrective action.
        A3.12.3.3. HQ USAF/A7CH sends a copy to HQ USAF/JA for review and determination of legal
        sufficiency. Complaints found legally sufficient by HQ USAF/JA are processed according to
        DoDI 1100.16.
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                     99


A3.13. Related Complaints:
   A3.13.1. When the Housing Flight Chief receives more than one complaint against the same agent or
   facility, the complaints may be consolidated for the purpose of the inquiry, legal review, Commander’s
   memorandum, and forwarding action. However, the consolidated case file should include a separate
   HUD Form 903 for each complainant.
   A3.13.2. When the Housing Flight Chief receives a second complaint against the same agent or facil-
   ity after finalizing an unsubstantiated complaint report, a new investigation must be initiated.
   A3.13.3. When housing management receives a complaint against an agent or facility already under
   restrictive sanctions, the Commander:
       A3.13.3.1. Sends a summary of the facts about the new complaint to the MAJCOM, an analysis
       of the extent to which it and related information affects the prior report and supporting documen-
       tation.
       A3.13.3.2. Sends the complaint to other agencies, as required.
       A3.13.3.3. Informs the complainant of the action taken on the prior complaint, plus any ongoing
       action related to the current complaint.

A3.14. Follow-Up Action. After the report and attachments are sent, the Commander takes the following
actions:
   A3.14.1. Coordinates the investigation and case processing with HUD, DOJ and state or local repre-
   sentatives.
   A3.14.2. Regularly follows up with HUD area or regional office on the status until HUD resolves or
   closes the complaint.
   A3.14.3. Informs the complainant about information received and action being taken by HUD or
   DOJ.
   A3.14.4. Make sure DoD personnel comply with the restrictive sanctions imposed on the facility or
   agent.
       A3.14.4.1. Military personnel moving or changing their place of residence in the commuting area
       of the installation are prohibited from entering into a rental, purchase or lease arrangement with an
       agent of a facility under restrictive sanctions.
       A3.14.4.2. Restrictive sanctions do not apply to DoD personnel who are residing in a facility at
       the time the restrictive sanction is imposed, or who wish to renew or extend a rental or lease agree-
       ment begun before the restrictive sanctions were imposed.
       A3.14.4.3. Relocation of a military tenant within a restricted facility is prohibited without the
       written approval of the Commander.
   A3.14.5. Establish procedures to ensure DoD personnel are informed about current restrictive sanc-
   tions, and establish controls to determine where a member finally locates housing. If a military mem-
   ber takes residency in a restricted facility, contrary to instructions, the Commander takes
   administrative or appropriate disciplinary action.
100                                                        AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007


      A3.14.6. As a minimum, publish a current list of facilities on restrictive sanction in the base bulletin
      and newspaper when there has been an addition, deletion, or change to the list. Also, publicize the list
      through other appropriate media, such as newcomer briefings and commander calls.

A3.15. Removing Restrictive Sanctions:
      A3.15.1. Remove restrictive sanctions under the following circumstances.
         A3.15.1.1. Upon request, HQ USAF/A7CH may approve a waiver to lift the restrictive sanctions
         before the 180-calendar day limit for unusual or exceptional circumstances. For example, the dis-
         criminatory act was a single action of the manager but the owner has a nondiscriminatory rental
         policy, has forbidden the discriminatory practice or has replaced the agent. Submit the request to
         waive the 180-day calendar day limit through the MAJCOM to HQ USAF/A7CH, and:
             A3.15.1.1.1. Outline the agent’s action to correct the situation.
             A3.15.1.1.2. Provide the agent’s commitment, in writing, to stop further discrimination.
             A3.15.1.1.3. Outline the agent’s affirmative action to ensure nondiscriminatory policy in the
             future.
             A3.15.1.1.4. Provide other supporting data, such as the number of minorities currently resid-
             ing in the facilities and the number of units.
             A3.15.1.1.5. Describe the positive result on the civilian and military communities if restric-
             tive sanctions are removed before the 180-calendar day minimum ends.
         A3.15.1.2. When the 180-calendar day period ends, remove restrictive sanctions if the agent pro-
         vides a written assurance of future nondiscrimination policy to the Housing Flight. As determined
         locally, the agent or base official may initiate the assurance, but the Commander’s decision to
         remove the restrictive sanctions must be supported by the written assurance.
      A3.15.2. The Commander informs the Housing Flight Chief, social actions officer, public affairs
      officer and the agent, in writing, when the facility is removed from the restrictive sanctions list.

A3.16. Processing Inquiries Under the Privacy Act (PA) and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
Process PA and FOIA requests for information as outlined in DoDR 5400.7/AF Supplement, AF FOIA
Program, or AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program, as applicable.

A3.17. Complaints Made Outside the United States. Upon receiving a complaint of discrimination,
the Housing Flight:
      A3.17.1. Consults with the JA to determine if the Status of Forces Agreement or other host nation or
      local laws, conflict with actions outlined in this AFI.
      A3.17.2. Takes action outlined in this AFI, except a HUD Form 903 is not required. Do not send
      complaints from outside the United States to HUD or DOJ. Inform the complainant that the fair hous-
      ing provisions of the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1968 do not apply outside the United States.
      A3.17.3. Determines, with JA counsel, how to pursue the discrimination complaint, based on laws of
      the host nation.
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                               101


A3.18. Referring Complaints to Other Agencies:
   A3.18.1. If the complainant requests the complaint and supporting documents be sent to HUD for
   action under the Civil Rights Act of 1968, the Commander sends the original complaint and the HUD
   Form 903 to Fair Housing, HUD, Washington DC 20410-9000.
      A3.18.1.1. Forward the HUD Form 903 to HUD at the time the complainant reports the incident
      to a housing representative. To take action, HUD must receive the complaint within 180 days of
      the alleged discrimination. To ensure meeting the 180-day requirement, send the complaint to
      HUD before initiating the preliminary inquiry and subsequent procedures.
      A3.18.1.2. Recommend the Commander also send a copy of the complaint to the local HUD
      regional office, but state in the transmittal memorandum that the complaint is being sent to HUD
      headquarters and other agencies for action or information.
   A3.18.2. When forwarding a complaint to HUD, send an information copy of the complaint and the

      A5.2.2. MAJCOMs provide a copy of the request submitted to AFRPA/RE.
      A5.2.3. To convey Capehart Housing units, AF must obtain a release from the lease-interest owned
      by USAF Housing, Inc. Release of these leases requires concurrence of the corporation. SAF/GCN
      processes the release with the corporation. HQ USAF/A7C requests SAF/GCN assistance in gaining
      release from the leases when Capehart units are identified for conveyance as part of privatization.
      MAJCOMs provides the following information to support this requirement:


              Lease number
              Lease term beginning date
              Name of the lessee (Capehart project owner)

A5.3. Demolition of MFH Units Related to MILCON.
      A5.3.1. Authority for approval to demolish FH units is delegated to HQ USAF/A7C. HQ USAF/
      A7C must notify SAF/IEI and USAF Housing, Inc. of approval to demolish Capehart and Wherry
      units.
      A5.3.2. The number of units to be demolished is identified for a MILCON project on DD Form 1391,
      Military Construction Project Data, (specific units are not identified). However, HQ AF has no vis-
      ibility for which units are inadequate or surplus (or both), or whether the units are owned by USAF
      Housing, Inc, (Capehart and Wherry) and require SAF/IEI notification.
      A5.3.3. Upon authorization of a MILCON project that includes disposal of family housing units, HQ
      USAF/A7C approval is required, on a by unit basis, for all units to be disposed of as part of a project.
      Upon approval for disposal, HQ USAF/A7C will make the appropriate notification to SAF/IEI. MAJ-
AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007                                                                 105


   COMs provide the following information along with the completed AF IMT 300 for HQ USAF/A7C
   approval.


          Identify units surplus to the installation requirement as indicated by the most recent
          HRMA and HCP
          Identify whether each unit is adequate or inadequate as indicated by the latest CAM
          score
          Identify Capehart Housing and Wherry Housing units
          Include a copy of the completed AF IMT 813 (should have been accomplished as part
          of the planning, design, and programming process)
          McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act Screening (checklist)
          Cultural and Historic assessments, as needed
          Walking Shield Program considerations, where appropriate

   A5.3.4. Unlike privatization, the AF is not required to obtain a release from the lease-interest owned
   by USAF Housing, Inc for housing units disposed of as a result of a MILCON project since the AF
   will retain control of the land. The corporation and SAF/GCN do not support pursuing the release of
   the lease-interest.

A5.4. Demolition of Surplus MFH with O&M Funding.
   A5.4.1. Identify and program requirements for demolishing FH units in the IFHMP. Demolition not
   identified through conveyance in privatization or through a MILCON project can be included in the
   MFH O&M Financial Plan (RPMC project list) data call for the appropriate fiscal year. Identify
   requirements not anticipated or not programmed in the IFHMP in the annual Financial Plan (RPMC
   project list) data call.
   A5.4.2. In addition to a DD Form 1391, MAJCOMs provide the following information along with the
   completed AF IMT 300, for HQ USAF/A7C approval.


          Identify units surplus to installation requirement as indicated by the HRMA and HCP.
          Identify whether each unit is adequate or inadequate as indicated by latest CAM score
          Identify Capehart Housing and Wherry Housing units
          Complete AF IMT 813
          McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act Screening (checklist)
          Cultural and Historic assessments, as needed
          Walking Shield Program considerations, where appropriate

   A5.4.3. Unlike privatization, the AF is not required to obtain a release from the lease-interest owned
   by USAF, Inc for FH units disposed of as a result of an O&M project since the AF will retain control
   of the land. The corporation and SAF/GCN do not support pursuing the release of the lease-interest.

A5.5. Conversion of Family Housing (FH) Units to Other Uses.
   A5.5.1. Conversions of FH units for other uses require SAF/IEI approval.
106                                                       AFI32-6001_354FWSUP_I 29 AUGUST 2007


      A5.5.2. FH units determined to be surplus to the installation based on the current HRMA may be con-
      verted to other uses. Only units considered adequate based on the HCP CAM may be converted.
      Units considered inadequate due to functional suitability deficiencies, but otherwise in adequate con-
      dition, may be converted (AFI 32-9002). To justify conversion, include information identified in
      Attachment 4.
      A5.5.3. Surplus FH units may not be diverted (temporarily converted).

A5.6. Divestiture of MFH Units Via Conveyance to Host Nation
      A5.6.1. Methods. Only four methods are authorized for divesting MFH units in foreign OCONUS
      locations: Permanent conversion, demolition, lease termination and conveyance to host nation. Any
      other method requires approval of HQ USAF/A7CH.
      A5.6.2. Permanent Conversion. Follow guidelines in Attachment 4 for permanently converting
      MFH units.
      A5.6.3. Demolition. MFH units may be demolished as part of a MILCON project or as a separately
      identified RPMC project.
      A5.6.4. Early Lease Termination. Early termination of leased housing units reduces the period of
      commitment in the lease agreement and may result in a financial penalty. Submit waiver requests for
      early termination, including a full justification and cost benefit analysis, to HQ USAF/A7CH for
      approval.
      A5.6.5. Conveyance to Host Nation: Units identified for conveyance to the host nation will be con-
      sidered divested when (a) the last occupant moves out, and (b) the host nation has been notified of the
      desire to transfer. Code units pending transfer inactive in ACES.

                                DEFINITIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS
                            AF IMT 1327 REDISTRIBUTION OF HOUSING
Use ACES-generated AF IMT 1327 to determine distribution and redistribution of FH. ACES uses a
standardized mathematical model to analyze redistribution of FH requirements (minus Key and Essential
housing). NOTE: Make sure all Key and Essential, Command and SCP occupants are identified in
ACES. Calculations are for adequate government-controlled housing (government-owned and govern-
ment-leased housing.
CALCULATIONS: There are six steps to complete the redistribution analysis:
      1. Establish housing requirements and assets
      2. Establish Key and Essential personnel
      3. Compute revised housing requirement minus Key and Essential assets
      4. Compare recommended distribution
      5. Compare recommended distribution to present distribution
      6. Obtain approval to change to distribution or retention of existing redistribution
I. WAITING LIST. ACES enters number of personnel on waiting lists for adequate FH in appropriate
columns for each grade category. Eligible personnel on waiting lists are counted in their specific grade
category and bedroom size, whether or not they elected to accept one bedroom less.
II. ELIGIBLE OCCUPYING QUARTERS. ACES will enter the number of current residents (eligible
personnel), by grade category and bedroom size in appropriate columns. ACES includes all personnel in
the unit for which they are eligible, regardless of the unit they currently occupy. The intent is to determine
the actual eligibility requirement.
III. TOTAL REQUIREMENTS. ACES adds Waiting List and Eligible Occupying Quarters columns, by
grade category and bedroom size, to calculate total requirements.
IV. HOUSING ASSETS. ACES enters total available adequate government controlled housing assets at
the installation. Inadequate Housing assets are not included.
V. PERCENTAGE OF BEDROOM REQUIREMENTS. ACES calculates the percentage of total hous-
ing requirement (expressed as a decimal, carried out to four decimal points) for each grade category and
bedroom requirement. The sum of all decimals in each category must equal 1,000.
VI. KEY & ESSENTIAL SET ASSIDES. ACES enters the number of residents with the Out Of Turn
Code set to Key and Essential, Command Position or Special Command Position on the Status tab of
member’s record.
VII. REVISED HOUSING ASSETS. ACES subtracts the K&E in section VI from actual housing assets
in Section IV.
VIII. REVISED RQMTS & PERCENT OF TOTAL. The new total and percentage are calculated, minus
Key and Essential.
IX. DISTRIBUTION W/O KEY AND ESSENTIAL SET ASIDES. The revised housing assets in Sec-
tion VII are multiplied by the decimals developed in section VIII, then rounded off to the nearest whole
number.

X. ANALYTICAL REDISTRIBUTION. The Key and Essential in Section IV are added to the numbers
arrived at in Section IX. This section represents the distribution of all government controlled housing
assets based on equal housing opportunity, regardless of grade category (except Key and Essential).
XI. EXISTING APPROVED DISTRIBUTION. The current distribution in ACES of all government
controlled housing.
XII. DISTIBUTION CHANGES REQUIRED. The difference between the analytical distribution in Sec-
tion X and the existing ACES distribution in section XI. A positive number indicates that the category
and bedroom size require additional assets. A negative number indicates that the category and bedroom
size have underutilized assets.
XIII. REAL PROPERTY DESIGNATION OF HOUSING. The permanent grade designation of the gov-
ernment-controlled housing assets.
XIV. RECOMMENDATION. The Installation Commander approves the recommendation for the distri-
bution of government-controlled housing assets by placing an X and signing in the appropriate box. If the
third option (Adoption of Different Distribution) is recommended, the different distribution and rationale
are included as an attachment. Once the recommendation is approved, ACES reflects the change.
