                                            Chapter 1

                  FSS MWR PROGRAM PURPOSE AND PROHIBITIONS

1.1. Purpose. Support the Air Force mission by contributing to readiness and improving
productivity by providing programs that promote fitness, esprit-de-corps, and quality-of-life for
authorized patrons or customers. All MWR programs represented in this instruction are part of
the FSS.
1.2. Standards of Conduct. The standards of conduct published in DoD Directive (DoDD)
5500.07, Standards of Conduct and DoD 5500.07-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER), are
applicable to personnel assigned to or employed by FSS programs and services. Violations by
military personnel are punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).
1.3. Equal Opportunity. The non-discriminatory provisions in AFPD 36-2706, Equal
Opportunity Program Military and Civilian, and relevant Air Force publications are applicable
to FSS MWR programs, services, and entertainment, and shall guide Air Force officials and
employees in the performance of their duties.
1.4. Fiduciary Responsibility. Nonappropriated funds (NAFs) are government funds entitled
to the same protection as funds of the United States Treasury. NAFs are designated for the
benefit of authorized patrons and the purposes of the NAF instrumentality (NAFI). Related
guidance is located in AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs), and AFI 65-106,
Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) and Nonappropriated
Fund Instrumentalities (NAFIs). Examples of types of activities within each MWR category are
in Attachment 3. The support responsibilities for each category are as follows:
     1.4.1. Commanders/Directors are responsible for prompt detection, proper investigation, and
     appropriate corrective action in matters involving suspected misuse or misappropriation of
     NAFs. Individuals reporting NAF violations are protected from reprisal. AFMAN 34-310,
     Nonappropriated Fund Personnel Program Management and Administration Procedures, is
     applicable to NAF employees, former employees, applicants for appointment to positions and
     employers. Commanders/Directors shall take appropriate action against present and former
     personnel responsible for violations.          In cases of a serious criminal infraction,
     Commanders/Directors shall refer the matter to the appropriate defense criminal investigative
     organization for investigation and referral to judicial authorities.
     1.4.2. Under Title 10 United States Code Section 2783b, a NAF civilian employee who
     commits a substantial violation of the regulations governing the management and use of
     NAFs shall be subject to the same penalties provided by law for misuse of appropriations by
     a civilian employee paid from appropriated funds (APF). Violations by military personnel
     are punishable under the UCMJ.
1.5. Program Prohibitions. Do not:
     1.5.1. Offer programs that don’t fit the intent of the activity, i.e., that deviate from core
     mission.
     1.5.2. Continue to offer programs that are not adequately supported by market demand.
AFI34-101 28 MARCH 2013                                                                           5

   Beverage Program.
   1.5.8. Operate resale activities, except as authorized in paragraph 2.5 of this instruction.

   Community Recreation Sports Centers, Skeet and Trap programs or other programs as
   defined by installation commander. In accordance with AFI 34-110, paragraph 3.7.2., Air
   Force Outdoor Recreation Programs and Procedures, (citing the Gun Control Act of 1968)

                                          Chapter 2

                                     PROGRAM SCOPE

2.1. Types of Services. To fulfill the intent of MWR programs, activities have differing levels
of involvement and support. The degree of activity involvement in providing programs to
customers depends on the nature of the activity, mission requirements, customer demand and
available resources. All management and financial data reported shall comply procedures and
support requirements IAW AFI 34-209, NAF Financial Management and Accounting and AFI
65-106.
   2.1.1. Category A: Mission Sustaining Programs. These programs are considered most
   essential in meeting the organizational objectives of the Air Force by promoting the physical
   and mental well-being of the military member. Category A programs shall be supported
   almost entirely with APFs, with the use of NAFs limited to specific instances where APFs
   are prohibited by law or where the use of NAFs is essential for the operation of a facility or
   program.
   2.1.2. Category B: Basic Community Support Programs. These programs are closely
   related in terms of supporting the military mission, to those grouped in Category A. They
   satisfy the basic physiological and psychological needs of Air Force members and families,
   providing, to the extent possible, the community support systems that make an Air Force
   installation temporary home towns for a mobile military population. These programs are
   entitled to substantial amounts of APF support, but differ from those in Category A because
   of their ability to generate some NAF revenue which provides for a portion of their funding.
   Community support activities can provide services free, or charge customers fees which go to
   the installation MWR fund. Fees will also cover the cost to the installation MWR fund for
   providing the service.
   2.1.3. Category C: Revenue-Generating Programs. These programs have the business
   capability of generating income to cover their operating expenses. Category C programs
   receive limited APF support for indirect costs such as police and fire protection and to
   maintain the structural integrity of the facility. These programs at designated remote and
   isolated locations may receive the same type of APF support as Category B programs.
   Category C activities must be self sustaining and charge fees based on the revenue
   requirements of the installation MWR fund and fees charged for similar services in the
   surrounding local community. AFI 65-106 contains further guidance on indirect costs and
   limitations on APF support for remote and isolated locations.
   2.1.4. Mission Required Services. These programs are required to sustain the mission and
   are supported solely with APFs. These services include Linen Exchange, Mortuary Affairs,
   and Food Service. Some services are provided without charge and others provide an
   allowance, require reimbursement or a combination thereof.
2.2. Funding. MWR programs should receive funding at the same level as other support-
programs on the installation. MWR programs shall be resourced from either APF or NAF or a
combination of both. NAF expenditures for valid MWR programs are not an augmentation of
appropriations.
 8                                                                    AFI34-101 28 MARCH 2013


     2.2.1. Contractors and Concessionaires. Unless addressed specifically by contract, a
     contractor or concessionaire of a NAFI that sells or provides authorized MWR products or
     services is entitled to the same level of APF support authorized for the applicable MWR
     programs.
     2.2.2. Fees. MWR programs may charge fees to cover NAF costs associated with
     management and maintenance of APF-provided equipment or materials.
     2.2.3. Merchandise Pricing. Except when authorized by regulation, no merchandise may be
     given away or sold for less than cost. An authorized patron shall not receive special prices or
     privileges not available to other patrons. This does not prohibit tailoring unique promotions
     to major target groups (for example: families, single personnel, retirees, etc.) as a means of
     increasing participation. Special prices and privileges shall not be given to functions
     designated as command-sponsored.
     2.2.4. Personnel. MWR programs are authorized APF manpower for executive control and
     essential command supervision and IAW the appropriate funding category specified in AFI
     65-106. MWR programs will be staffed primarily with APF or NAF civilians. Military
     personnel may be assigned on a temporary basis, to include detail and temporary duty.
     Temporary assignments may be made only under the following conditions:
        2.2.4.1. Mobility or deployment requirements occur.
        2.2.4.2. Training to upgrade/maintain essential skills that can’t be provided through other
        means.
     2.2.5. Excess NAF Cash. All cash in installation MWR funds excess to MWR requirements
     shall be transferred to the applicable Air Force Central Fund (MWR).
2.3. Use of NAFs. NAFs generated from MWR programs or associated programs, shall only be
used within those programs. The Secretary of the Air Force (SecAF) may approve limited
waivers for programs closely associated with FSS MWR activities. Unauthorized use of NAFs is
addressed in AFI 34-209.
     2.3.1. Command-Sponsored.      Official command-sponsored programs are normally
     authorized APF support. NAFs may be used for unique events such as Open Houses. Refer
     to paragraph 2.8, Open Houses, and AFI 10-1004, Conducting Open Houses, Chapter 6, for
     authority.
     2.3.2. Limitations on use of NAFs. MWR programs are not authorized to provide NAF
     financial assistance to private organizations or individuals, unless reimbursed or as
     authorized by AFI 35-101, Public Affairs Responsibilities and Management, AFI 36-3101,
     Fundraising Within the Air Force, and AFI 34-223, Private Organizations (PO) Program.
     MWR programs shall not distribute, transfer, or donate NAF property or assets to a private
     organization, entity, or individual. Individuals, units, organizations, or installations shall not
     have proprietary interest in NAFs and NAFI assets. NAFs shall be used for the collective
     benefit of authorized patrons. Owners are assessed fees and charges for privately owned
     horses, boats, recreational vehicles, or aircraft that are stabled, moored, provided utilities, or
     rendered other APF or NAF support.
2.4. Closure of Activities. All requests to close Services activities must be routed through the
Major Command (MAJCOM)/A1 to the Air Force Personnel Center Services Directorate,
AFI34-101 28 MARCH 2013                                                                         9


Installation Support Division (AFPC/SVI) to AF/A1S for final disposition no later than 60 days
prior to proposed closure. Neither requests nor notifications are required for any activity being
closed due to an installation closure. Follow procedures detailed in AFI 34-201. Requests will
include rationale, the alternative to be used in place of the activity, and documentation of
approval to use any alternate source. In reviewing whether to continue or discontinue programs
or activities use the criteria below:
   2.4.1. Accessibility and capabilities of existing exchange service, installation, commercial or
   civilian community alternatives.
   2.4.2. Current and planned MWR programs of adjacent DoD installations.
2.5. Resale. AAFES is the primary source of resale merchandise, excluding the Defense
Commissary Agency stores. MWR is the secondary source of resale merchandise and services.
MWR activities may engage in resale when the installation commander determines (in
coordination with AAFES and the FSS) that AAFES cannot be responsive to the particular resale
requirement. Non-AAFES and non-MWR activities should refer to AFI 34-223 for guidelines on
resale activities.
   2.5.1. For the FSS to establish a new resale activity, the installation commander shall
   approve a written agreement between the FSS Commander/Director and the regional vice
   president of the servicing exchange, stating AAFES cannot meet the particular requirement.
   MAJCOM/CCs resolve disputes that occur that cannot be resolved locally. Resale activity
   disputes resolved and approved by MAJCOM/CCs or resale operations that are a natural
   extension of the MWR program (i.e., Golf Course Pro Shop, etc.) are subject to a biennial
   review.
   2.5.2. The installation commander evaluates FSS resale activities biennially to determine
   whether to continue operating them. The installation commander must consider the
   following issues when establishing and evaluating these resale activities:
       2.5.2.1. AAFES (or MWR activity, where applicable) operating hours.
       2.5.2.2. Distance to the activity from the AAFES or MWR activity and the ability to
       provide delivery service.
       2.5.2.3. Ability of AAFES or MWR activity to provide an adequate line of the types,
       brands, and quality of goods and services needed to satisfy the particular resale need at
       acceptable prices.
   2.5.3. A non-AAFES resale activity can only sell goods and services directly related to its
   purpose and function. Resale merchandise sold in the continental United States (CONUS) is
   limited to items listed in AFI 34-211(I). Other resale policies and procedures for civilian
   welfare funds and installation restaurants are prescribed in AFJI 34-122, Civilian
   Nonappropriated Funds and Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Activities.
   2.5.4. AAFES usually operates fast food operations. The installation commander can
   consider the FSS operating a new, non-AAFES activity based on the criteria in paragraph
   2.5.2
   2.5.5. Audio and/or photo clubs can be established only at overseas installations.
   MAJCOM/CCs establish policies and procedures regarding sale of merchandise and services
   consistent with Air Force and AAFES resale programs. These clubs may offer the same
 10                                                               AFI34-101 28 MARCH 2013


   products and services offered by AAFES when the installation commander determines it
   necessary to satisfy customer needs. Customers need not be members to make purchases or
   obtain services.
   2.5.6. An approved MWR resale activity can offer consignment sales, as long as the activity
   has safeguards to limit its liability for the merchandise, and the FSS Commander/ Director
   approves.
   2.5.7. Overseas clubs can have commodity concession contracts under a management fee
   arrangement with AAFES. The installation commander must address (in coordination with
   AAFES) the issues in paragraph 2.5.2 to consider a non-AAFES commodity concession
   contract for these activities. MAJCOM/CC must approve these FSS commodity concession
   contracts.
   2.5.8. MWR activities, employees, or concessionaires cannot receive direct benefit from
   sales by or referrals to off-base commercial sources. This does not preclude special order
   sales by activities. Activities can make catalogs, brochures, and other sales literature from
   commercial sources available to customers if:
      2.5.8.1. The items covered are not available through AAFES nor MWR.
      2.5.8.2. Participation by reputable sales sources is not restricted, and all transactions are
      between the customers and the commercial sales sources, with no involvement of NAFs.
   2.5.9. MWR resale activities can own or contract for amusement machines in FSS facilities
   (Refer to AFI 34-211(I)). The FSS Commander/Director approves locations. FSS can have
   AAFES provide the service through a management fee arrangement.
2.5.10. FSS can operate a vehicle rental or taxi service using NAFs if AAFES declines.

      2.5.10.1. In the US, vehicle rental or taxi services can only be authorized through
      concessionaires. Concessionaires must provide the vehicles and commercial liability
      insurance.
      2.5.10.2. In overseas areas, vehicle rental or taxi services can be operated with NAF-
      purchased vehicles or through concessionaires.
      2.5.10.3. APF vehicles, including vehicles obtained through the Defense Reutilization
      Marketing Office, cannot be used in these types of programs.
   2.5.11. Such programs must be self-sustaining.
   2.5.12. Resale policies described above do not apply to:
      2.5.12.1. The resale of alcoholic beverages including beer.
      2.5.12.2. NAF MWR inventory/equipment sales where the sole reason is to reduce dead
      stock or outdated inventory items.
      2.5.12.3. Participation fees and charges, registration fees, dues, and/or assessments that
      offset all or part of the NAF costs of providing the services. Establishing fees, charges,
      dues and/or assessments is a basic budgetary process. Procedures are outlined in AFI 34-
      209.
AFI34-101 28 MARCH 2013                                                                       11


   2.5.13. No sexually explicit material may be offered for sale or rental on property IAW AFI
   34-211(I).
2.6. Allowable Games of Chance:
   2.6.1. Bingo, Monte Carlo, and Texas Hold’em events as controlled by AFMAN 34-228, Air
   Force Club Program Procedures, and DoDI 1015.10.
   2.6.2. Limited card games and nominal games of chance conducted by and among activity
   customers (for example, rolling dice or drawing high card for snacks). Such games must be
   operated with discretion and conform to local law or custom. The installation commander,
   with the advice of the Staff Judge Advocate, determines which games fit the criteria.
   2.6.3. Slot machines and gaming machines with payout features, outside the United States
   (outside the 50 states, territories, and possessions), as controlled in AFMAN 34-229, Air
   Force Slot Machine Program Operations, Controls and Procedures.
2.7. Fundraising Events. MWR activities can sponsor fund-raising events and projects related
to the purpose of, and for the benefit of, the FSS organization. These fund-raising events cannot
benefit charities, foundations, private organizations or individuals, even if the FSS NAFI shares
in the proceeds. Also, these activities cannot collect money for charities/worthwhile causes
sponsored by other organizations.
   2.7.1. The FSS Commander/Director approves the event and establishes a special advisory
   committee to oversee planning the event. This committee includes the NAFI custodian, and
   representatives from comptroller, engineers, security police, contracting, and staff judge
   advocate. These events must also comply with the requirements in AFI 36-3101.
   2.7.2. MWR facilities (e.g., golf course, bowling facility, athletic fields, etc.) can only be
   made available for fund-raising by a non-Federal entity if the event meets the requirements of
   AFI 36-3101, and DoD 5500.7-R.
2.8. Open Houses. Refer to AFI 10-1004 for comprehensive open house guidance.

                                           Chapter 3

                                     USE ELIGIBILITY

3.1. Program Eligibility and Use Priority. Attachment 2 provides general eligibility and use
priority for MWR programs.
   3.1.1. Priority use policies are most important during periods when demand exceeds supply,
   and when reservations (such as golf course tee times) are needed to ration access.
   3.1.2. Guests have the same priority as their sponsors who must accompany them and be
   responsible for their conduct. Installation commanders approve local rules governing the
   number of guests permitted and the frequency of use at specific facilities. Guest participation
   should not inhibit use by eligible customers.
   3.1.3. Community agreements may be established with local governments so that MWR
   patrons may use similar Category A and B MWR activities that may be available in the local
   community when it is in the best interest of the Air Force and when the provisions of such
   agreements are otherwise in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. These
   agreements must be approved by the Secretary of the Air Force. When existing Category C
   activities have capacity excess to authorized patron requirements, AF/A1S may grant waivers
   for local community use on a case-by-case basis. Authorized patrons are in Attachment 2.
3.2. Use of AAFES and Commissary facilities. AFI 34-211(I) and DoDI 1330.17, Armed
Services Commissary Operations, provide eligibility and use priority information for these
facilities.
   3.2.1. The installation commander can extend use of these facilities to an agent of an
   authorized user, when the user is not capable of shopping (usually up to a year). FSS
   documents the authorization using a letter of appointment (Refer to the AFI and DoD
   regulation listed above for appropriate circumstances for extending privileges to an agent).
3.3. Suspension, Termination, and Denial of Privileges. Patronage privileges can be
suspended, terminated, or denied by the installation commander for cause. Personnel will be
notified by letter. Abuses for which privileges may be suspended or terminated include, but are
not limited to, the following:
   3.3.1. Using FSS facilities to make or repair items for personal gain.
   3.3.2. Distributing merchandise purchased at an MWR activity to unauthorized persons,
   whether or not for profit. (Using such merchandise as a gift is permissible).
   3.3.3. Personally profiting from use of FSS merchandise and services, stealing merchandise
   or other assets.
   3.3.4. Presenting bad checks intentionally or repeatedly and failing to make restitution on
   dishonored checks or other indebtedness owed to an MWR activity.
AFI34-101 28 MARCH 2013                                                                          13


                                            Chapter 4

                                  STRATEGIC PLANNING

4.1. Strategic Planning. MWR programs shall be strategically planned and implemented using
business management practices to fulfill local needs, while maintaining the readiness capability
to support the wartime mission and to meet quality, fiscal, health and safety standards. The
installation FSS will have annual and long-range plans that identify local program requirements
and ensure quality, fiscal, health, and safety standards are met.
   4.1.1. FSS must follow a formal strategic planning process when developing their plans.
   4.1.2. When developing and implementing their strategy, the most successful organizations
   will:
       4.1.2.1. Identify and segment customers; define their wants and needs in measurable
       terms.
       4.1.2.2. Establish mission and direction for the organization; define critical success
       factors or key business drivers.
       4.1.2.3. Identify key performance measures based on the critical success factors.
       4.1.2.4. Develop both short- and long-term goals and strategies based on the key
       measures and success factors.
       4.1.2.5. Include financial, operational, supplier capability, customer satisfaction, and
       product/service quality measures to balance performance reviews.
       4.1.2.6. Define, control, and continuously improve all key business processes.
       4.1.2.7. Manage customer relationships to allow maintenance of high levels of
       satisfaction and anticipation of future requirements. Establish customer relationship
       goals that stress quality customer service interaction to create and maintain a high level of
       satisfaction.
       4.1.2.8. Organize and train employees to promote high performance; motivate and
       reward behaviors that support goals.
4.2. Annual Plan. Annual plans are focused on the short-term (less than 2 years) and identify
key goals and strategies that are tied to projections of future customers and their requirements.
   4.2.1. Process improvement based on inputs from customers, suppliers, employees and the
   business environment is the primary focus of this short-range plan.
   4.2.2. FSS Commanders/Directors will communicate completed plans with everyone in the
   unit.
       4.2.2.1. Plans will be translated into actionable key performance drivers that serve as the
       basis for deploying the plans to the appropriate organizational level.
   4.2.3. FSS Commanders/Directors will ensure feedback loops are designed for each goal and
   objective. These measures will allow the commander to track performance against planned
   outcome and allow for midcourse corrections.
 14                                                              AFI34-101 28 MARCH 2013


       4.2.3.1. FSS Commanders/Directors will consider using management information
       systems to assemble data on customers, processes, suppliers, etc., and to analyze and
       track trends for use in adjusting strategic plans.
   4.2.4. The plans will be reviewed on a regular basis (e.g., quarterly) and adjusted as needed
   to achieve desired outcomes or to realign with changing customer expectations.
   4.2.5. The annual plan will focus on the near-term. Managers responsible for marketing,
   training, facility, and financial planning should make substantial inputs to the annual plan.
   The individual plans, if developed, should be aligned with and support the annual plan for the
   organization.
4.3. Long-Term (3-5 Year) Plan. Where the annual plan is focused on continuous process
improvement to meet and exceed customer expectations, the long-range plan should look out
over the horizon and anticipate future requirements associated with forecast changes in mission,
operating environment, customers, stakeholders, or their requirements.
   4.3.1. The long-term plan will provide a listing of projected equipment requirements, facility
   improvements and construction, and other documented improvements that help meet
   customer and stakeholder needs. AFI 34-205, Services Nonappropriated Fund Facility
   Projects, provides further guidance on planning capital requirements.
4.4. Air Force Services Activity Standards. The AFPC/SV will develop Services Activity
Standards for AF/A1S approval. These standards define the minimum operation and program
requirements for Services activities. AFPC/SVI may supplement standards with AFPC/SVI
unique requirements. As a minimum, the Services Activity Standards will include:
   4.4.1. FSS Personnel. All personnel must fulfill the mission, meet set standards for
   qualification and training, use information systems to accomplish program goals and
   objectives, and should be representative of core activity programs.
   4.4.2. Facilities. Ensure MWR facilities adequately support programs and services that meet
   the demands of authorized patrons. MWR construction programs are supported by Project
   Validation Assessments, as described in AFI 34-205 and AFI 32-1022, Planning and
   Programming Nonappropriated Fund Facility Construction Projects, and should seek
   solutions that provide long-term economies of scale and efficiencies, such as multi-use
   facilities.
   4.4.3. Programming. Ensure MWR programs meet mission requirements and are market
   driven. AF/A1S, MAJCOM/A1, and FSS Commanders or Directors, will periodically
   measure customer demand, usage, and satisfaction and act upon findings.
   4.4.4. Equipment. Provide a comprehensive and timely equipment replacement plan to
   support the useful life as detailed in AFMAN 34-214, Procedures for Nonappropriated
   Funds Financial Management and Accounting. Provide a comprehensive, effective and
   timely equipment preventive maintenance plan and repair service for all equipment with
   inspections and repairs documented for the life of the equipment.
   4.4.5. Administrative. Ensure all administrative, financial and safety requirements are in
   compliance with existing directives and specific activity standards.
   4.4.6. Financial. Ensure MWR programs are resourced with APFs and NAFs as appropriate
   and ensure installation MWR NAFIs are financially sustainable.
AFI34-101 28 MARCH 2013                                                                        15


                                           Chapter 5

                                 VOLUNTEER PROGRAM

5.1. Volunteers. Certain voluntary services may be accepted in programs providing services to
military members and their families IAW AFI 36-3009, Airman and Family Readiness Centers.
Volunteers represent a significant resource for the Air Force. They improve services by
providing program user input; expand efforts of military and civilian staff, and extend service
delivery capability. This AFI applies to volunteers who donate their services to authorized FSS
MWR programs. This AFI does not apply to volunteers who donate their services to private
organizations or commercial organizations on the installation even when their services may be in
direct support of a program providing services to members of the Air Force and their families.
Individuals who volunteer their services to private or commercial organizations are not provided
tort claims and workers compensation coverage by the government. Volunteers give their time
without direct compensation. Volunteer duties are limited in scope and liability.
   5.1.1. Acceptance of volunteer services. Voluntary services are accepted by the installation
   commander or designee. Use DD Form 2793, Volunteer Agreement, before volunteer
   services are accepted. The installation commander can limit volunteer services. Only
   volunteer services intended to be free and unconditionally given can be accepted. Voluntary
   services must be accepted on behalf of the Air Force (rather than on behalf of a NAFI). The
   installation commander may designate activity managers and above to accept volunteer
   services. Volunteers:
       5.1.1.1. Cannot obligate the government (either APFs or NAFs).
       5.1.1.2. Supplement rather than replace paid employees.
       5.1.1.3. Are not provided preferential treatment (free products or services), future
       employment, or other indirect benefits not received by volunteers in other agencies on the
       installation (refer to allowable incentives in paragraph 5.2.1).
       5.1.1.4. Comply with all activity policies.
       5.1.1.5. Do not perform duties in which they are susceptible to injury or causing injury to
       others.
       5.1.1.6. If under 18 years of age, must provide evidence of parental permission to
       provide services.
       5.1.1.7. Are supervised comparable to compensated employees providing similar
       services.
       5.1.1.8. Cannot be accountable for the management, quality, financial solvency, and
       health/safety of a program or activity.
       5.1.1.9. Can accomplish duties requiring limited accountability.
5.2. Recruitment. MWR activities can recruit their own volunteers. The Airman & Family
Readiness Center (A&FRC) provides volunteer resource services (Refer to AFI 36-3009). These
officially sanctioned volunteers are considered to be employees of the Government for the
purposes relating to compensation for work-related injuries, and to be employees of the
 16                                                                AFI34-101 28 MARCH 2013


Government for the purposes, relating to tort claims with respect to services they provide that are
within the scope of the voluntary services accepted.
   5.2.1. Although volunteers should not expect preferential treatment, MWR activities can
   offer support and incentives that promote participation:
       5.2.1.1. Training and internal Air Force skill certification that supports more professional
       volunteer participation.
       5.2.1.2. Records of volunteer achievements, and letters of recommendation.
5.3. Training and Management. MWR activities train volunteers to adequately handle the
responsibilities assigned to them. As a minimum, activities give volunteers the employee
orientation, a description of what is expected of the volunteer, and what the volunteer can expect
from the MWR activity. Training will include confidentiality, ethics and avoidance of conflict of
interest. At the completion of a volunteer’s service, the volunteer’s supervisor records the
amount of time donated by the volunteer on the DD Form 2793.
5.4. Recognition. The FSS Commander/Director establishes a unit-wide program to provide a
broad basis for recognition and to make recognition across FSS activities equitable. The FSS
coordinates their recognition program with the A&FRC.
5.5. Student Work-Experience Program (Student Educational Employment/Student
Career Experience Program). When paid for their work, students are employees and fill
authorized APF or NAF manpower positions.
   5.5.1. When not paid for their work, students are considered volunteers and must comply
   with the rules governing volunteer participation. In addition, the installation and the school
   must have a written agreement stating:
       5.5.1.1. The students volunteer their time to the MWR activity (not to the NAFI), and
       that the school gives permission for the students to do the work.
       5.5.1.2. The hours, location, type of work, and responsibilities of the agencies involved.
       5.5.1.3. The students will not receive any pay or benefits from the Air Force.
       5.5.1.4. The Air Force does not consider the students federal employees, except for
       certain tort and workers’ compensation claims (Title 5 United States Code Section 3111).
   5.5.2. Students may receive pay for some work and be in a non-pay status for other work-
   experience. The periods of paid and non-paid work must be distinct and included in the
   written agreement between the installation and the school.
