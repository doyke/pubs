 This HOI implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 33-3, Information Management, and
 must be used in conjunction with AF Instruction (AFI) 33-360, Publications and Forms
 Management. It establishes procedures and standards for the creation and management of
 Headquarters Air Force (HAF) operating instructions. It explains the process for publication and
 level of use, and describes how and when to prepare, revise, and rescind them. This instruction is
 applicable to all personnel at the HAF, including contractor personnel. Refer recommended
 changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)
 using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication and forward to SAF/AAII
 Policy Branch at saf.aaii.policy@pentagon.af.mil. Ensure that all records created as a result of
 processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual
 (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force
 Records Information Management Systems (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS)
 located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm

 SUMMARY OF CHANGES
 This revision eliminates the use of HAF operating publications other than instructions; it
 includes updates in organizational titles and aligns organizational responsibilities in agreement
 with current operations. It also changes the OPR to SAF/AAII.
 1. Overview: While AFPDs, AFIs, AFMANs, etc., provide departmental (Air Force-wide)
2                                                                  HOI 33-13 9 JANUARY 2013



guidance, HOIs are only applicable to a Headquarters. HOIs must be linked to a departmental
publication (parent publication), and carry its subject series number.
2. Roles and Responsibilities:
    2.1. The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force (SAF/AA):
       2.1.1. Establishes Headquarters Air Force publication guidance and procedures, through
       the Information Directorate (SAF/AAI).
       2.1.2. Approves all HOIs.
    2.2. The Policy and CIO Support Division (SAF/AAII) Policy Branch:
       2.2.1. Is a mandatory coordinator for all HOIs.
       2.2.2. Manages the HOI program for the HAF.
       2.2.3. Provides OPRs with control numbers for new publications and maintains an
       index of current and rescinded publications.
       2.2.4. Reviews draft publications and returns draft to OPRs for consideration/rewrite
       when major changes are required.
       2.2.5. Reviews final draft and ensures all recommended changes were made or
       exceptions justified.
       2.2.6. Processes final draft for “publication” to include placing an image of the Air
       Force Seal on the Heading.
       2.2.7. Publishes HOIs electronically on the Air Force Portal https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
       af/USAF/ep/contentView.do?contentType=EDITORIAL&contentId=c6925EC1839490F
       B5E044080020E329A9.
       2.2.8. Announces new and rescinded publications on the AF Portal at
       https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
       af/USAF/ep/contentView.do?contentType=EDITORIAL&contentId=c6925EC1839490F
       B5E04408002E329A9.
       2.2.9. Sends AF Forms 673 to the OPR to initiate periodic reviews IAW AFI 33-360.
       2.2.10. Initiates action to rescind HOIs when an OPR cannot be determined and/or the
       HOI is clearly obsolete.
    2.3. OPR:
       2.3.1. Adheres to guidance in AFI 33-360 and this HOI, for developing, formatting,
       coordinating, updating, and rescinding HOIs.
       2.3.2. Designates an individual to serve as the Point of Contact (POC) for the HOI and
       provides SAF/AAII Policy Branch with the POCs name, office symbol and phone
       number.
       2.3.3. For new publications, determines a subject/Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC)
       series IAW AFI 33-360, and requests a publication control number within that series
       from the SAF/AAII Policy Branch. For example, 33 is the subject/AFSC series for HOI
HOI 33-13 9 JANUARY 2013                                                                         3



       33-13 and 13 is the control number. The series number is determined by the content of
       the document and its parent publication. See AFI 33-360 for a list and description of
       series.
       2.3.4. Provides the SAF/AAII Policy Branch with the coordinated draft publication,
       consolidated AF Form 673 and an adjudicated comment matrix (CRM) (as applicable),
       for mandatory coordination.
       2.3.5. Forwards the coordinated draft publication, consolidated AF Form 673, and
       adjudicated CRM to SAF/AA for final approval and signature.
       2.3.5. Records Management. Maintains original documents including the completed AF
       Form 673, the coordinated draft publication, and all other pertinent data as the
       publication record set within the OPRs filing system (see AFMAN 33-363). The current
       OPR must provide the complete record set to the new OPR when there is a transfer of
       responsibility.
       2.3.6. Reviews publications periodically or for special reviews as directed and
       revises them as necessary.
3. Publication processing and content.
   3.1. The process for developing, formatting, coordinating, updating and rescinding HOIs is
   largely the same as is for other AF publication as defined in AFI 33-360, with a few
   exceptions. Those exceptions are as follows:
       3.1.1. SAF/AA is the approving official for all actions regarding HOIs.
       3.1.2. SAF/AAII Policy Branch is a mandatory coordinator for all HOIs.
       3.1.3. SAF/AAII Policy Branch is the publishing activity for all HOIs.
    3.2. HOIs only apply to the HAF, which includes both the Secretariat and Air Staff
    organizations.
       3.2.1. If guidance prescribes procedures to be followed by FOAs, DRUs, or MAJCOMs
       in addition to the HAF, another publication type (e.g., AFI, AFMAN, AFPAM, etc.) must
       be used IAW AFI 33-360.
       3.2.2. If the guidance applies to only one organization at the HAF, then it is not
       considered an HOI and the OPR must follow the guidance in AFI 33-360 for publications
       for units below the headquarters level. For example, an OI applicable only to AF/A3/5
       will be signed by the 2-letter and carry its header (i.e., an AF/A3/5 OI will carry “BY
       ORDER OF THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF FOR OPERATIONS, PLANS AND
       REQUIREMENTS”).
   3.3. Describe responsibility being assigned, action directed, or procedures prescribed. The
   description should be clear and concise, and should not repeat what is already written in
   another publication (refer to AFI 33-360).
4. Coordination: Coordination consists of technical/functional, mandatory coordination and
ends with certification and approval (see Table 4.1.). OPRs will obtain coordination on draft
publications using physical or electronic medium. Coordination may be transcribed onto the AF
Form 673, which must accompany the draft submitted for publication. The AF Form 673 will be
4                                                                    HOI 33-13 9 JANUARY 2013


 prepared as defined in AFI 33-360.

       4.1. OPRs adhere to technical/functional coordination requirements as prescribed in AFI 33-
       360. Coordination from two- letter/digit offices with technical/functional interest or
       oversight, are annotated in section III of the AF Form 673. OPRs will work with two
       letter/digit offices to resolve comments prior to submitting the publication for mandatory
       coordination. If there are any prescribed forms within the publication, include the
       Information Reports Management and Control Office (SAF/CIO A6PP) as a
       technical/functional coordinator. Any issues resulting in a “concur with comments”
       statement will be documented using a comment matrix (CRM) and included in the package.
       4.2. Mandatory coordination is the second step in the coordination process. Packages are
       forwarded to SAF/AAII Policy Branch for review and coordination.
       4.3. After receiving mandatory coordination, the draft will be returned to the OPR to
       obtain certification and approval on the AF Form 673.
       4.4. The OPR will forward the completed AF Form 673, the proposed draft publication and
       the adjudicated CRM (if applicable) to SAF/AAII Policy Branch for publication.
 Table 4.1. Routing for Coordination, Certification, Approval and Publishing of an HOI.

    Route to:                    For:
    Organizations affected by    Technical/Functional Coordination
    or involved in the subject
    matter of the publication
    SAF/AAII Policy Branch       Mandatory Review and Coordination
    Owning two-letter/digit      Certification
    Office
    SAF/AA                       Approval
    SAF/AAII Policy Branch       Publication Posting

 5. Rescissions. Rescissions of HOIs are based on the decision of the issuing two-letter that a
 specific publication is no longer needed. Requests for rescissions must be submitted using an AF
 Form 673 and are coordinated and processed in the same manner as a newly written or revised
 HOI. When a publication is rescinded, any prescribed forms are rendered obsolete. Therefore, if
 the rescinded publication prescribes an Air Force form or report, the OPR must include this
 information on the AF Form 673 and send a copy of the request for rescission to Information
 Reports Management and Control Office (SAF/CIO A6PP).
