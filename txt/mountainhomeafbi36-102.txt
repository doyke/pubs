2. Overview. Supervisors and managers are responsible for taking positive action to eliminate
dangers and risks which contribute to or cause hazards, physical hardships, or working
conditions of an unusually severe nature. Supervisors and managers are also responsible for
reducing such dangers and risks to levels consistent with Air Force instructions, Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidance, or other recognized national standards.
Where management action does not eliminate severe working conditions, hazards, or physical
hardships, payment of the appropriate differential cited in 5 CFR, 532.511 and FWS Operating
Manual, is warranted. Annual or special reviews will also be made by the 366th Mission
Support Squadron, Civilian Personnel Office (366 MSS/DPC), the 366th Fighter Wing Ground
Safety (366 FW/SEG), and the 366th Aerospace-Dental Squadron, Bioenvironmental
Engineering Flight (366 ADS/SGGB), of all previously identified EDP situations with the
purpose of reducing or eliminating hazards, physical hardships, or unusually severe working
conditions, in order to determine whether continuing entitlement to EDP is warranted.

4. Procedures:
   4.1. Initial Request for Payment. When a supervisor believes the criteria for EDP has been
   met, the supervisor will submit an AF Form 683 to 366 MSS/DPC. Requests for EDP will
   include a brief description of the work performed, the possible hazards, physical hardships,
   or working conditions to which employees are exposed, and what measures have been taken
   to reduce or eliminate the situation(s). Only one category of exposure will be contained on
   the AF Form 683. Request for coverage of different categories; e.g., high work, hot work,
   etc., will be submitted and reviewed separately. Requests containing insufficient information
   will be returned to the originator for completion and resubmittal. Attachment 1 provides
   specific guidance required on the AF Form 683. Attachment 2 is a sample of a completed
   AF Form 683.
      4.1.1. Approval/disapproval of EDP. Upon 366 MSS/DPC receipt, the AF Form 683 is
      reviewed for adequacy of information. If the information provided is sufficient, the AF
      Form 683 will be sent to 366 FW/SEG and 366 ADS/SGGB for technical evaluation.
      Upon completion of evaluation, 366 FW/SEG and 366 ADS/SGGB representatives will
      submit a typed technical evaluation/opinion as to the nature and recommendation for
      approval or disapproval of EDP, in light of the applicable category contained in FWS
      Operating Manual, Appendix J. Evaluation should include suggestions or a plan of
      action for review. 366 MSS/DPC will approve/disapprove requests for EDP based on the
      information available. Final decision regarding approval/disapproval of work situations
      will be provided to the submitting organization, 366 FW/SEG and 366 ADS/SGGB.
      Supervisors will notify the affected employees of changes.
      4.1.2. Periodic Review. 366 MSS/DPC will initiate an annual review of currently
      approved EDP situations to ensure conditions still exist to authorize payment. If
      conditions have changed, supervisors will initiate a new AF Form 683, re-describing the
      situation and identifying conditions that have changed since previous approval. Forms
      will be submitted to 366 MSS/DPC for final determination IAW paragraph 4.1.
