This regulation implements AFSPC guidance and clarifies Air Force policy so as to comply with
current Department of Defense space control negation policy guidance. Should conflicting
guidance between AFSPCI 99-103, Capabilities-Based Test and Evaluation of Space and
Cyberspace Systems, 29 Dec 2010, and this instruction arise, use this instruction as the higher
authority in resolving the conflict. HQ AFSPC requires 30 days to staff packages once HQ
AFSPC/A3SC determines the CAAP is complete and ready for coordination. This instruction
applies to Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) personnel (including contractors) AFSPC
subordinates and non AFSPC organizations that are involved in AFSPC funded, directed and/or
sponsored live fire space control negation activities. This supplement applies to Air Force
Reserve Command (AFRC) units and to the Air National Guard (ANG) when conducting
counterspace events. The scope of this Instruction includes any testing, series of tests, training,
experiment, demonstration, or exercise of live fire testing of space control negation capabilities.
The HQ AFSPC/A3 is the sole waiver authority for CAAP content. Submit request for waivers
through the chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval authority, or alternately,
the Publication OPR for non-tiered compliance items. This Instruction does not apply to SMC
organizations, when in a supporting role to non-Air Force organizations. This publication may
be supplemented at any level, but all direct Supplements must be routed to the OPR of this
publication for coordination prior to certification and approval. The supported agency is
responsible for approvals IAW their directives. OCONUS developmental tests that do not
include live fire will be detailed in a Developmental Test Notification Package (DTNP). The
Program Executive Office (PEO) for Space is the sole waiver authority for Developmental Test
Notification Package (DTNP) content. The policy authority for this instruction is HQ
AFSPC/A3. Developmental and operational tests (DT/OT) will follow Air Force Space
Command Instruction (AFSPCI) 99-103, Capabilities-Based Test and Evaluation of Space and

                          PURPOSE OF SPECIFIC PACKAGES

1.1. Counterspace Activity Approval Package (CAAP) Use. A CAAP is used to obtain
approval for a space control negation event by demonstrating to senior leadership that a space
control negation activity has been thoroughly planned and risks have been appropriately
mitigated. Specific guidance for CAAP content and approval (to include timelines) is in
Chapter 5.
1.2. Counterspace Training Activity Plan (CTAP) Use. A CTAP is developed by HQ
AFSPC/A3S and specifically relates to live fire training activities. Specific guidance for CTAP
content and approval (to include timelines) is in Chapter 6.
1.3. Developmental Test Notification Package (DTNP) Use. A DTNP is developed by
SMC/SYR (Rapid Reaction Branch) and specifically relates to SMC non-live fire developmental
test activities. The DTNP is used for notification to senior leadership of an OCONUS non-live
fire (e.g. dummy load, closed loop) developmental test (DT). Specific guidance for DTNP
content and approval (to include timelines) is in Chapter 7.
1.4. Tactics, Techniques & Procedures Approval Package (TAP) Use. Tactics, Techniques,
and Procedures (TTPs) are approved and authorized for operational use by units operating Space
Control weapon systems. A TAP is submitted for new TTPs to be certified for training, not real-
world use, and must be staffed through HQ USAF and OSD for approval. Specific guidance for
TAP content and approval (to include timeliness) is in Chapter 8.

                                         DEFINITIONS

2.1. Closed-loop environment. An environment comprised of integrated systems or networks
with an Electronic Attack (EA) waveform generated at the correct frequency but not connected
to a high power amplifier (HPA) or transmit antenna.
2.2. Controlled environment. Area, location, site, or facility that controls the observation of
signatures beyond its boundaries which would disclose classified capabilities (e.g.,
electromagnetic emissions). An example of such a location is an approved anechoic chamber.
2.3. Dummy Load. A device physically attached to the transmit path of a radio frequency (RF)
system designed to prohibit free-space radiation while allowing full power operation.
2.4. Free Space environment. The region where electromagnetic energy can radiate into open-
air, either directed or non-directed, external to a system where there is potential that emissions
can be detected or capabilities compromised.
2.5. Observable. Anything, such as a physical property, temperature, frequency, etc., that may
be observed or measured directly.
2.6. Offensive Space Control (OSC) systems. Equipment operated with the intent to deceive,
disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy space capabilities.
2.7. On-orbit targets. Target systems physically located in space on-orbit, e.g. satellites.
2.8. Requesting Agency. The MAJCOM, or other agency seeking permission to conduct a
Space Control Negation activity.
2.9. Space Control. Space control operations require the ability to monitor and assess (Space
Situational Awareness (SSA)), deter, defend against and recover from attacks (Defensive Space
Control (DSC)), and negate adversary space capabilities (Offensive Space Control (OSC)).
2.10. Space Control Negation. Active defensive and offensive measures to deceive, disrupt,
degrade, deny, or destroy an adversary’s space capabilities. Measures include actions against
ground, data link, user, and/or space segment(s) to negate adversary’s space systems, or to thwart
hostile interference with or attacks on US/allied space systems.
2.11. Supporting Agencies. Any agency or unit supporting live or non-live fire activities.
2.12. Terrestrial targets. Targets located on the earth’s surface as opposed to space. This can
be an actual ground based target (e.g. ground station) or a simulator that imitates the behavior of
an on-orbit satellite (e.g. terrestrial based transponders). Terrestrial-based transponders are an
example of possible targets to be used for tests and training.

3.1. HQ AFSPC/A3S.
     3.1.1. Develops CAAP, CTAP, DTNP and TAP policy and guidance.
     3.1.2. The OPR for all CAAPs, CTAPs and TAPs entering HQ AFSPC for staffing and
     approval.
3.2. HQ AFSPC/A3SC.
     3.2.1. Will review CAAPs to ensure all documents are ready for Major Command
     (MAJCOM) coordination.
     3.2.2. Has a maximum of 5 calendar days to review documents and designate the appropriate
     MAJCOM Division Advocate (HQ AFSPC/A3 for Operational Testing (OT), HQ

                       ACTIVITIES WHICH REQUIRE PACKAGES

4.1. Activities Requiring CAAPs. The following AFSPC activities require a CAAP: Tests,
series of tests, training, experiments, demonstrations, exercises, or any event conducting free
space activities for the purposes of offensive space control-negation or other forms of electronic
attack (EA). This includes systems conducting free space radiation activities against terrestrial
based surrogate targets (e.g., Terrestrial Based Transponder, satellite uplinks, etc.). AFSPC
organizations, when not part of a Combatant Command (COCOM) exercise, will use the CAAP
process described in this document to obtain Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF) or
Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) approval for conducting space control negation activities. If
the counterspace activity is in support of a COCOM’s exercise, the requesting organization will
use the appropriate joint process to obtain approval. The Review and Approval Process will be
used IAW (S/NF) Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual 3122.07, IJSTO Supplement to Joint
Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES) Volume I (Planning Policies and
Procedures), Appendix C (IJSTO Review and Approval Process).
4.2. Activities Not Requiring CAAPs. The following CONUS AFSPC activities do not require
a CAAP: standard satellite communications and command and control of satellites, tests, series
of tests, training, experiments, demonstrations, and exercises of a capability which do not radiate
into free space (e.g., labs, dummy load, anechoic chambers, etc.), or radiating without the
purpose of electronic attack. Additionally, Blue satellite communications program testing, to
include system vulnerabilities, tests conducted as part of the acquisition or IOC and FOC phases
are not required to submit a CAAP. SMC directed level activities conducted by contractors, with
or without government oversight, that are not directed against on-orbit assets, do not require a
CAAP. This includes, but not limited to, Zenith tests, antenna characterization testing, etc.
4.3. Submitting CAAP Requests. CAAPs for DT, combined DT/OT, experiments or
demonstrations will be submitted to SAF/AQS; OT-only, training or exercise CAAPs will be
submitted to HAF/A3SO.
4.4. Activities requiring DTNPs. The following SMC activities require a DTNP: A SMC-led
space control negation OCONUS non-live fire developmental test, (e.g., labs, dummy load,
anechoic chambers, closed loop, etc.).
4.5. Submitting DTNPs. DTNPs will be submitted by SMC/CC in his or her role as the
Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Space or designated representative to SAF/AQ with
notification to HQ AFSPC/CC or designated representative.
4.6. Multiple Events. Within a 12 month window, if AFSPC chooses to conduct multiple
testing or training events that are linked, or are very similar in nature, it is acceptable and
encouraged to submit one comprehensive CAAP or DTNP that covers the multiple events. The
timelines for submitting Multiple Event CAAPs and DTNPs are the same as single event
CAAPs. Reference section 5.14, CAAP Approval Timelines. HQ AFSPC/A3SC will submit
updates to multiple event CAAPs, CTAP, TAPs, and SMC/SYR will submit updates to DTNPs.
4.7. Activities Requiring CTAPs. The Annual CTAP is created and submitted by HQ
AFSPC/A3SC through HQ AFSPC/A3 to AFSPC/CC for endorsement by the Secretary of the
Air Force on an annual basis. Individual CTAPs for recurring live fire training events are
AFSPCI10–211 28 MAY 2014                                                                      11


submitted by the 14 AF to HQ AFSPC/A3SC, who will review for completeness before sending
to HQ AFSPC/A3. Once the approval package is complete, HQ AFSPC/A3 will request
AFSPC/CC approval for the individual training event.
4.8. Activities Requiring a TAP. TAP packages are submitted for new TTPs to be certified via
live fire for training, and must be staffed through HQ USAF and OSD for approval. The TAP
consists of a Concept of Operations, detailed description of the new TTPs, and tactics bulletins,
if available. TAP packages will be provided to HQ AFSPC/A3SC and be reviewed for
completeness prior to seeking HQ AFSPC/A3 endorsement to Air Staff.
4.8.1. Once the DEPSECDEF has approved a new TTP for live fire training and the live fire has
been successfully executed, HQ AFSPC/A3 will add the TTP to the standard list of approved
training TTPs. Further live fires of the TTP will be approved by the appropriate approval
authority for the overall activity.

include physical, information, personnel, OPSEC, communications security, computer, training,
education and awareness are defined per specific activity. Complexity of disciplines may vary
per activity. MSSPs will include the following sections:
   7.4.1. Test Locations. Describes the particular physical security and access control
   requirements for the deployed operations site which houses the system. The plan highlights
   sites and activities in the immediate vicinity surrounding the operations site that could pose a
   threat to security.
       7.4.1.1. SCIF/TSCIF Requirements, layout, Access
       7.4.1.2. Mission Computers
       7.4.1.3. System Hardware
   7.4.2. Public Affairs: Contains a list of possible questions and suggested responses.
   7.4.3. Transportation Security. Outlines how unit personnel will travel and the details
   concerning transport system, support equipment, and classified material.
 20                                                            AFSPCI10–211 28 MAY 2014


   7.4.4. Emergency Actions. Provide the procedures to be followed by personnel to protect
   life and property and to restore the test activity in the event of enemy attack, sabotage, or
   natural disaster. The plan is also designed to establish actions necessary to prevent loss or
   compromise of classified information in emergency situations. Classified activities should be
   designed to mitigate observables. Each sensitive capability should identify mission
   protection measures taken to ensure all observables are addressed. Determine what, if any,
   observables an adversary could collect during that step or action.
7.5. AFSPC Legal Review. (Tab 4)* The DNTP advocate obtains the HQ AFSPC/JA legal
review memo. The legal review provides legal opinion as to whether the activity described in
the DTNP is consistent with U.S. domestic and international law. The legal review tab can be
included in the 3-letter coordination package prior to being finalized, and marked as “Draft.”
7.6. DTNP Timelines.
   7.6.1. 30 days SAF/AQS review and OSD notification (as required).
AFSPCI10–211 28 MAY 2014                                                                         21


                                              Chapter 8

TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, AND PROCEDURES (TTP) APPROVAL PACKAGES (TAP)

8.1. TAP Overview. The tabs listed are required in all TAPs. TAP packages are submitted for
new TTPs to be certified for live fire training, and must be staffed through HAF and OSD for
approval. TTPs associated with real world operations, as identified in AFTTP 3-1, Tactics,
Techniques, and Procedures, do not follow this process. The TAP consists of a Concept of
Operations, detailed description of the new TTPs, and tactics bulletins, if available. Once
approved, the TTP will be added to CTAP. An asterisk (*) identifies the tabs which may be
included in the 3-letter coordination package while marked as “Draft” if not finalized.
8.2. Endorsement Letter. (Tab 1) Provides AFSPC endorsement of the TTP activity, signed
by the AFSPC/A3 or designated representative. The endorsement letter is drafted by HQ
AFSPC/A3SC prior to seeking AFSPC/A3 endorsement to Air Staff.
8.3. Concept of Operations (CONOPS) (Tab 2) The CONOPS will include the following
areas.
   8.3.1. Description of the target system.
   8.3.2. Description of weapon system.
   8.3.3. TTPs being used during the event and tactics bulletins (if available).
8.4. AFSPC Legal Review. (Tab 3)* The TAP advocate obtains the HQ AFSPC/JA legal
review memo. The legal review provides legal opinion as to whether the activity described in
the TAP is consistent with U.S. domestic and international law.
8.5. Range Control Plan. (Tab 4)* Provide a comprehensive summary of the support provided
by the Range for planned live fire signal testing, training, and exercise events. If the STTR is not
being used for a TTP validation, a HQ AFSPC/A3 waiver is required along with the equivalent
range document from the supporting range organization. The range control plan will contain
processes and procedures for mitigating effects of a counterspace system should the system go
outside of approved operating limits. All live TTP events will be conducted with full Range
Control. The Range Control Plan can be requested directly from the supporting range.
8.6. Signals Intelligence Threat Mitigation Report (STMR). (Tab 5)* The STMR is a NSA
document that analyzes the SIGINT threat to the activity and recommends actions to mitigate the
threat. The TAP sponsor will request this product early in the TAP development process to
provide NSA/S3X time to analyze the activity and write the document. NSA requires a
minimum of two weeks to produce the STMR. The STMR tab can be included in the 3-letter
coordination package prior to being finalized, and marked as “Draft.”
8.7. Technical OPSEC Assessment (TOA). (Tab 6)* The TOA is a NASIC document that
provides a detailed assessment of the operational security environment surrounding the activity
and recommends actions to mitigate the threat. The TAP sponsor will request this product early
in the TAP development process to allow NASIC/SMA time to analyze the activity and write the
document. NASIC requires a minimum of two weeks to produce the TOA. The TOA tab can be
included in the 3-letter coordination package prior to being finalized, and marked as “Draft.”
 22                                                               AFSPCI10–211 28 MAY 2014


8.8. Failure Mode Effects Analysis. Identifies the system’s potential failure modes and
planned mitigation steps in case anomalies arise during the activity. Include a risk level for each
hazard and an overall assessment for potential failure. Analysis must include Threat Risk
assessment and an operational Risk Management assessment.
8.9. Risk Management. Provide the RM approach that will be used during TTP live-fire
certification.
   8.10.1. Risk Assessment. Provide the risk assessment approach that will be used during TTP
   live-fire certification.
8.10. Coordination (Staffing). All TAP tabs must be in place prior to beginning AFSPC
coordination. HQ AFSPC 3-letter staffing timeline does not begin until all documents are in
place and ready for coordination.
   8.10.1. Draft documents are not authorized during 2-letter coordination. All documents
   must be final prior to 2-letter coordination. HQ AFSPC/A3SC will ensure the required tabs
   outlined in Chapter 8 are in place for submission to HQ AFSPC/A3 for approval.
   8.10.2. The TAP sponsor is authorized to request the TOA, STMR, Range Support Memo
   and Legal Review directly from the appropriate agencies. The Range Control Plan, TOA,
   and STMR must accompany the request for Legal Review.
8.11. TAP Approval Timelines.
   8.11.1. Sponsors must submit TAPs IAW established timelines. Delays will impact planned
   execution dates. TAPs for DEPSECDEF approval will be submitted to HAF NLT 90 days
   prior to start of the event window. Therefore, the complete TAP must be received at HQ
   AFSPC/A3SC NLT 125 days prior to the planned event execution. This allows for:
       8.11.1.1. 35 days staffing at HQ AFSPC, including 5 days for HQ AFSPC/A3SC review.
       8.11.1.2. 30 days for HAF/SAF staffing.
       8.11.1.3. 60 days for Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) staffing.

                        HQ USAF ROLES AND RESPONSBILITIES

A3.1. Introduction. The information in this attachment is not intended to be directive, but is
included for informational purposes only. Reference HQ USAF guidance for policy regarding
the roles and responsibilities of the below agencies. Space control negation activities are often
sensitive and technically complex, and therefore require detailed planning and a technical focus.
The Air Force senior leadership expects their staffs to thoroughly review the CAAPs for
consistency, completeness and to highlight potential areas of risk. It is advantageous for the HQ
USAF’s organizations to be involved in certain aspects of AFSPC’s internal approval process so
that potential areas of risk can be identified and resolved early in the CAAP, CTAP, DNTP and
TAP approval processes. The following organizations are critical to a successful review,
analysis, and presentation to the Air Force senior leadership.
A3.2. OSD(P). Reviews and coordinates all CAAPs for OSD.
A3.3. HAF/A3SO. Responsible for reviewing and coordinating OT and Training CAAPs.
HAF/A3SO will review all CAAPs for completeness and consistency before submitting for HQ
USAF coordination. When DEPSECDEF approval is required and upon DEPSECDEF approval,
HQ USAF/A3S will sign the Authority to Proceed letter and forward it to HQ AFSPC/A3SC
along with the SAF/AAZ risk assessment.
A3.4. SAF/AQSC. Responsible for reviewing and coordinating the DT, and combined DT/OT
CAAPs. Directly responsible to USecAF for ensuring all DT and OT verified capabilities are
tested in a manner that are safe and minimizes security risks. SAF/AQSC will review all CAAPs
for completeness and consistency before submitting them for HQ USAF coordination. When
DEPSECDEF approval is required, SAF/AQSC will ensure HQ USAF coordination is complete
in 30 calendar days to allow for a 60 calendar day review at OSD prior to the scheduled test start
date. Upon receipt of the DEPSECDEF or SECAF approved CAAP, SAF/AQSC will be
responsible for ensuring an “Authority to Proceed” letter is forwarded to HQ AFSPC/A3SC
along with SAF/AAZ Risk Assessment.
A3.5. SAF/USI. Reviews the CAAP to ensure consistency with policy guidance and advises
USECAF/SECAF on policy issues and concerns.
A3.6. SAF/AAZ. Reviews the entire CAAP, paying particular attention to the TOA and STMR,
and writes a comprehensive Risk Assessment, addressing both the activity’s risks as well as risks
to Air Force and DoD space control equities. The Risk Assessment is critical to the CAAP
Review Process. The CAAP will not be forwarded to HQ USAF for 2-letter review without the
Risk Assessment. Once the SECAF approves the CAAP, it is submitted through SAF/AAZ to
OSD/SAPCO. Once the DEPSECDEF approves the CAAP, SAF/AAZ notifies the activity
OPR, either SAF/AQSC or HAF/A3SO, and the OPR will forward the Authority to Proceed
letter to HQ AFSPC/A3SC.
A3.7. SAF/GCI. Review the CAAP with a focus on legal assessment. It is not necessary for
SAF/GCI to write a legal assessment, unless there is a disagreement with AFSPC’s legal
assessment, which is part of the CAAP.
A3.8. AF/A2Z. Review the CAAP to ensure the timely and accurate completion of the TOA,
STMR.
