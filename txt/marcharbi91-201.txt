              4.4.2.7.2. Brief applicable cross feed information during the safety training.
           4.4.2.8. Tab "H", Miscellaneous.
    4.5. Spot Inspection Program:
       4.5.1. The safety spot inspection program provides a means for the Unit Safety
       Representative to periodically assess the health of the unit's safety program. Spot
       inspections are informal and often unscheduled.
MARCHARBI91-201 MARCH AIR RESERVE BASE INSTRUCTION 91-201                                    9


     4.5.2. Document spot inspections on a general-purpose log maintained in the program
     management notebook or a computerized system. Discrepancies that could not be
     corrected on the spot will be reevaluated within 30 days. Document all follow-up
     inspections until the discrepancy is corrected.
     4.5.3. Inspection Frequencies:
         4.5.3.1. The commander, in a letter filed in the management notebook, establishes
         the frequency of spot inspections.
         4.5.3.2. Ensure that activities that operate around the clock are adequately surveyed
         at times other than normal duty hours. Ensure program management items are
         evaluated.
     4.5.4. Inspection Areas:
         4.5.4.1. Explosives Safety Training: Evaluate the quality of instruction and testing.
         Inspect training documentation to ensure annual training requirements are met.
         4.5.4.2. People Performing Tasks: Observe personnel in the process of handling,
         transporting, maintaining, operating or storing explosives. This should comprise the
         bulk of the spot inspection program.
         4.5.4.3. Work Centers: Check bulletin boards, safety briefings and general safety
         knowledge.
         4.5.4.4. Equipment, Explosives Storage and Operating Locations: Examine the
         equipment used for handling explosive items and the condition of the items while in
         storage. Check licensed explosives facilities for adherence to licensed limitations.
         4.5.4.5. Plans, Base Regulations and Operating Instructions: The unit explosives
         safety representative must coordinate on all squadron AFTO 22, OIs and Instructions
         pertaining to explosives.
         4.5.4.6. See AFI 91-202 and AFMAN 91-201, for additional inspection areas.
  4.6. Training and Education:
     4.6.1. General. One of the most important elements of your explosives safety program is
     the training and education of each individual. This includes all personnel involved with
     the program from the commander to each individual worker. If one worker in the chain is
     not aware of individual responsibilities in implementing the program, then the training
     process has failed.
     4.6.2. The Unit Explosives Safety Representative is responsible for ensuring explosives
     safety training is accomplished. The safety representative can provide the training or the
     commander may designate a qualified unit trainer to perform this function.
     4.6.3. Explosives Safety Lesson Plans:
         4.6.3.1. Each unit is required to produce an explosives safety lesson plan tailored to
         the particular unit's needs to conduct explosives safety training. Applicable
         regulations and technical directives should be consulted to ensure all required
         elements are being included. Obtain wing safety approval of the lesson plan and any
         changes prior to implementation.
10         MARCHARBI91-201 MARCH AIR RESERVE BASE INSTRUCTION 91-201


     4.6.4. Explosives Safety Tests:
         4.6.4.1. Explosives safety tests are not required, but, if developed, they must be
         tailored to the unit lesson plan. Develop at least two distinctively different tests. A
         minimum of half the questions (50%) on each test must be completely different from
         each other.
     4.6.5. Training Documentation:
         4.6.5.1. Documentation proves individuals were trained and is necessary to ensure
         retrieval for numerous audits that are conducted throughout the year. The preferred
         method for documenting safety, fire and health training is through automation, such
         as Core-Automated Maintenance System (CAMS), AFRC Deployable Operations
         Training System (ADOTS), Air Force Operations Resource Management System
         (AFORMS), Automated Life-sustaining Equipment Records Tracking (ALERT)
         system, Training Business Area (TBA) or any other similar automated data system.
         Units without automated systems must use the AF Form 55.
  4.7. Publicity:
     4.7.1. The publicity program is part of the safety education process. Bulletin boards,
     briefing and publicity packages are some ways with which you can disseminate safety
     information.
  4.8. Mishap Investigations and Reporting:
     4.8.1. The Air Force investigates mishaps to determine cause and uses this information
     to prevent future mishaps.
     4.8.2. Investigation. The wing safety office has primary investigation authority for all
     mishaps resulting in personnel injury or equipment damage. In some cases the unit may
     be tasked to provide technical experts to assist with the investigation. For a major mishap
     resulting in severe injury, loss of life or extensive equipment damage, the wing
     commander may request a formal safety investigation board consisting of off-base
     personnel. Witness statements and photographic documentation of the mishap scene may
     be necessary and should not be impeded. Ensure mishap evidence is preserved and not
     tampered with until released by the safety office. Per AFI 51-507, paragraph 1.5.5, “In
     the event of conflicts between two investigations regarding access to the accident site,
     acquiring and examining evidence and interviewing witnesses, safety investigations have
     priority.”
     4.8.3. Reporting. Formal reporting of safety mishaps is detailed in AFI 91-204. The wing
     safety office determines which mishaps fall under the reporting criteria of this directive.
     The responsibility of the Unit Explosives Safety Representative is to be familiar with
     what constitutes a safety mishap and ensure the wing safety office is promptly notified. If
     there are any doubts about mishap reportability, contact the wing weapons safety
     manager.
     4.8.4. Limited-Use and Privileged Information. Some safety reports contain limited-use
     and privileged safety information that must be protected against unauthorized disclosure.
     Normally, safety reports forwarded to your unit by the wing safety office will be
     "sanitized" to remove this information. If you are permitted to see a limited-use or
MARCHARBI91-201 MARCH AIR RESERVE BASE INSTRUCTION 91-201                                       11


     privileged safety report, do not discuss the information with anyone outside of the safety
     community. The unauthorized disclosure of such information is punishable under Article
     92, Uniform Code of Military Justice, in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 3,
     AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports.
  4.9. Explosives Safety Awards Program:
     4.9.1. General: Wing safety quarterly and annual explosives safety awards are available
     for those who work in the weapons or explosives arena. They may be awarded to anyone
     in the unit who performs a significant event enhancing explosives safety. The
     responsibility is to keep the commander and unit supervisors informed of the awards that
     are available and encourage them to submit individuals for consideration. The wing
     safety office is available to help with submission of awards.
5. TRANSPORTATION AND HANDLING OF EXPLOSIVES:
  5.1. Responsibility: Explosives Safety Representatives will ensure surface transportation and
  air shipment of munitions are accomplished with adequate protection and in accordance with
  AFMAN 91-201 and/or AFJMAN 24-204.
  5.2. Emergency Situations:
     5.2.1. Prior to all munitions operations and movements, the operations supervisor will
     conduct a briefing to ensure all personnel are aware of step-by-step procedures. The
     supervisors will appoint specific positions and responsibilities to the members involved
     in the explosives operation.
     5.2.2. Vehicle Fire: Should the vehicle cargo become involved in a fire, on or off base:
         5.2.2.1. Explosives-laden vehicles, if safety permits, will be removed from any site
         that is involved in a fire or has the potential to become involved.
         5.2.2.2. Never attempt to extinguish a fire when explosives are already engulfed in
         the flames.
         5.2.2.3. The operations supervisor will make the decision to attempt fighting the fire,
         or to evacuate all non-essential personnel. The distance and assembly area will be
         briefed prior to the operation or transportation of munitions/explosives.
         5.2.2.4. Evacuate all personnel when explosives are engulfed in flames. Evacuate to
         the distance stipulated in the operations briefing for the type of munitions involved.
         5.2.2.5. The person responsible to contact the Fire Department and Security Forces
         will do so via the most expedient means of communication available (i.e., mobile
         radio, telephone). Inform the Fire Department or Security Forces of the type of
         explosives involved, location and how long the explosives have been involved in the
         fire.
         5.2.2.6. Individual(s) appointed the responsibility to direct traffic around the accident
         site will do so until relieved by Security Forces or other emergency personnel.
         5.2.2.7. Stop all entry into the hazardous zone with the exception of emergency
         personnel.

         SMALL ARMS AMMUNITIONS HANDLING PROCEDURES IN THE
                      TRAINING ENVIRONMENT

These wing procedures implement HQ AFRC policies for accountability and control of blank
and live small arms ammunitions. These procedures apply to all personnel during training or
exercises conducted at March ARB, California. Commanders will ensure ammunitions
custodians and Exercise Directors or Supervisors follow the ammunitions handling and issue
procedures established in this attachment during exercises, training or competitive events for
which blank ammunition is requested and issued.
1. Responsibilities. Responsibilities for implementing, monitoring and enforcing these
procedures are assigned as follows:
1.1. Unit Commanders:
1.1.1. Ensure all bulk blank ammunition is stored at the MSA (452 MXS/MXMW) or at an
authorized licensed location.
1.1.2. Ensure this instruction is complied with fully within the unit. Units are encouraged to
supplement this OI with squadron specific guidance, as deemed necessary, but may not diminish
from the spirit and intent of this OI. Each unit OI will be reviewed initially and annually by 452
AMW/SE office.
1.1.3. Appoint in writing a unit Exercise Director or Supervisor responsible for controlling the
inventory, issue and control of all blank ammunition requested for the exercise or training. In
cases where multiple units are involved, the unit commanders together will decide on who the
Exercise Director will be.
1.1.4. Ensure prior coordination with key agencies listed in paragraph 4.3 at least one day prior
to start of exercise.
Exercise Director or Supervisor:
1.2.1. If training and exercise plans involve using additional explosives devices, prepare a risk
assessment and comprehensive list of explosives detailing the NSN, HC/D and explosives
weights authorized for use in the exercise and a detailed list of locations where munitions will be
deployed. The installation commander must give written approval of the plan. Include weapons
safety personnel in exercise planning and risk assessment.
1.2.3. Ensure personnel not normally associated with explosives operations and exercises are not
exposed to explosives hazards.
1.2.2. Ensure the armorer and weapons courier are armed with a M9 (9mm) and live
ammunition only. Armorer and weapons courier when armed will not participate in live fire
exercise activities. They are armed for “Real World” resource protection function only.
1.2.3. Ensure Armorer and Weapons courier are qualified and have been trained on
accountability of ammunition procedures.
1.2.4. All ammunition will be stored in an armory or a licensed facility.

                           SAMPLE EXERCISE SAFETY BRIEFING

Exercise Safety Briefing
1. The Exercise Director or Supervisor will ensure this safety briefing is fully briefed to all
exercise participants prior to initiation of the exercise. The purpose of this briefing is to make
exercise participants clearly aware of all safety hazards, precautions, considerations and
procedures involved with exercises utilizing blank ammunition.
2. All participants must understand that safety is absolutely paramount and is second to nothing.
The briefer will ensure each area is completely covered and field questions when clarification is
needed in any area.
3. GENERAL SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS: As in all we do, SAFETY IS ABSOLUTELY
PARAMOUNT. If we can’t do it safely, we DON’T DO IT. Each and every exercise has the
potential for injury, loss of life and/or damage to equipment or property. EVERYONE has the
responsibility to immediately identify and stop any activity deemed as unsafe.
3.1. The Exercise Director or Supervisor, along with munitions personnel, will positively ensure
ammunition set aside for training only includes blank ammo; all ammo will be inspected by
munitions personnel prior to issue as a fail-safe per AFI 21-201, Chapter 2, and TO 11A-1-10.
All magazines will be loaded in a controlled environment; if loaded ahead of time, the magazines
will be stored in an ammo can and sealed with the Exercise Director or Supervisor viewing to
record the seal number. To comply with resource protection concerns, the armorer and weapons
courier will be armed. Prior to issuing blank ammo, all magazine pouches, rucks and applicable
bags will be emptied and inspected by the individual owner(s) and supervisor(s).
3.2. The inspector will initial all magazines to certify that only blank ammo has been loaded. An
inventory of all munitions in the field will be conducted at the start of the training or exercise. If
at any time a variance is discovered in the inventory, a “Cease Fire” will be declared and the
variance will be investigated. A third party will certify that only blank ammo has been issued to
the using party.
 3.3. The Exercise Director or Supervisor will attempt to have Medical and Fire Crews present
during the scenario.
4. WEAPONS SAFETY: The Exercise Director or Supervisor and armorer will ensure all
weapons have blank adapters installed. Any weapons without a blank adapter will be turned back
into the Armory.
4.1. Participants are authorized to remove ammo from friendly or OPFOR players who have
been terminated; weapons will remain in the possession of the individual. The only exception
will be the M60 machine gun; the M60 may be taken as long as the person is certified on the
weapon. No weapon of any type will be fired from a vehicle unless the vehicle is designed to
accommodate the weapon system being employed. Any person(s) violating this directive will be
immediately removed from the scenario.
 24          MARCHARBI91-201 MARCH AIR RESERVE BASE INSTRUCTION 91-201


4.2. M16s shall not be fired within 10 feet or an M60 fired within 20 feet of an individual.
Evaluators will remain in positions to enforce this safety measure. Participants will be briefed to
be especially cognizant of the dangers posed by weapons barrels/sights during individual
movement. Move safely and purposely, remembering one of the basic rules of tactical
movement, “positively know where you’re going and what is there before you go.”
5. OBSERVATION: Any participants observing an unsafe act or condition that endangers
personnel and/or equipment deemed serious enough to halt the exercise and receive immediate
attention will declare either on the exercise freq. or yell to others in the vicinity “Cease Fire.”
Anyone hearing this will immediately relay by any means available to the Exercise Director or
Supervisor. The Exercise Director or Supervisor will immediately respond to the location of the
hazard/incident and make a determination whether the exercise can continue or if a “Cease Fire”
is warranted. If required, the Exercise Director or Supervisor will immediately request
medical/FD support through CSC.
6. The Exercise Director or Supervisor will, in coordination with participants, oversee removal
of all spent casings and brass; ensure a sweep is conducted of the entire exercise area.
7. All participants will conduct equipment accountability upon termination and prior to
departing the exercise area.
8. All weapons will be cleaned and inspected prior to turn-in.
