    1.1. Air Force Occupational Safety and Health Standard (AFOSHSTD) 91-5, Welding,
    Cutting, and Brazing and T.O. 1C-135-2-4-1, Power Plant Ground Operation and
    Maintenance.
2. Responsibilities.
    2.1. Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) will:
       2.1.1. Notify the appropriate AMU of the welding requirements.
    2.2. AMUs will:
       2.2.1. Provide fireguard, tug operator, tow team, door operators and sufficient personnel
       to position the aircraft for welding.
       2.2.2. Prepare the aircraft for welding by completing their portion of the Aircraft
       Welding Fire Safety Checklist, AF Form 2519, All Purpose Checklist (Attachment 2).
       Once complete the AMU will ensure the checklist is given to the 18 EMS Fabrication
       Flight Metals Technology Section to complete their portion of the checklist and contact
       the Fire Department.
       2.2.3. Notify MOC when personnel and aircraft are ready for Metals Technology
       (welders).
       2.2.4. If welding in Hangar 3560 (North Isochronal Inspection [ISO]), notify MOC to
       have the doors for building 73332 and 73334 (hush house) closed to prevent the fire
       detection systems from activating.
    2.3. Fire Department will:
       2.3.1. Provide standby fire truck at welding site.
       2.3.2. Complete required fire safety checklists.
       2.3.3. Issue the AF Form 592, USAF Welding, Cutting, and Brazing Permit, to Metals
       Technology.
       2.3.4. Review the completed Aircraft Welding Fire Safety Checklist prior to start of
       welding.
    2.4. 18 EMS Fabrication Flight Metals Technology Section will:
       2.4.1. Dispatch two welding shop personnel with required equipment to the welding site
       when notified by MOC that the aircraft is ready for welding.
       2.4.2. Complete the 18 EMS portion of the Aircraft Welding Fire Safety Checklist.
       2.4.3. Ensure all checklist items are complete and welding area is properly prepared.
       The Metals Technology section will initiate all coordination with 18 CES Fire
       Department to ensure standby fire truck is available, review the area for fire safety and
       have the Fire Department issue the AF Form 592 to Metals Technology.
3. Procedures.
    3.1. In accordance with AFOSHSTD 91-5, paragraph 3.10.1., welding on aircraft should be
    done outside of hangars if possible. Aircraft may be parked in suitable hangars (Buildings
    3560 and 3660) with Fire Department authorization; as fire suppression systems will have to

   be disabled to weld inside of any hangar. If hangar space cannot be made available, aircraft
   can be welded while parked in three-sided revetments provided the ground wind speed is 5
   knots or less and the ground is dry with no rain anticipated.
   3.2. C-130 aircraft may be welded on the hardstands provided wind velocity does not exceed
   5 knots. Alternate areas/hangars can be utilized if coordinated on a case-by-case basis with
   the Fire Department.
   3.3. Aircraft requiring silver (hard) soldering will be soldered at any location not in the
   immediate vicinity of other aircraft or within 100 feet of flammable materials to include in
   ground fuel storage tanks.
   3.4. All items under Mobility of Aircraft in Attachment 2 will not apply for welding/silver
   soldering operations conducted in open areas.
   3.5. Items 5.1, 5.2, 5.5, 5.6, and 5.7 under Welding Equipment in Attachment 2 will not
   apply when soldering operations are performed.
4. AF Form 592 will be signed by the Fire Department representative and welding technician
and be kept at the welding site during the welding operation.
