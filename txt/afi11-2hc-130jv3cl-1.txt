       PARARESCUE DEPLOYMENT PROCEDURES

      PARARESCUE DEPLOYMENT (FIXED TARGET)
1. Head directly toward the target, regardless of wind direction.
2. Release the spotter chute/streamer directly over the target.
3. Immediately upon release make a left/right turn to observe
descent and position of spotter chute/streamer.
4. Establish a racetrack drop pattern. Final approach will be
aligned with the spotter chute/streamer and the target.
5. Turn on final – Use the SEARCH AND RESCUE AIRDROP
Checklist (PERSONNEL DEPLOYMENT Checklist.)

     PARARESCUE DEPLOYMENT (MOVING TARGET)
1. Head directly toward the target, regardless of wind direction.
2. Release the spotter chute/streamer directly over the target.
3. Immediately upon release make a left/right turn to observe
descent and position of spotter chute/streamer.
4. Establish a racetrack drop pattern. Final approach will be
aligned with the spotter chute/streamer and the target. Adjust the
pattern to be over target 5—9 minutes after spotter chute/streamer
is launched.
5. Turn on final – Use the SEARCH AND RESCUE AIRDROP
Checklist (PERSONNEL DEPLOYMENT Checklist.)

PARARESCUE DEPLOYMENT (CROSSWIND TARGET)
1. Fly over the target on a crosswind heading in a direction to
permit a left/right hand pattern.
2. Release the spotter chute/streamer directly over the target.
3. Make another 180 degree turn to place the aircraft on the
approach leg the same distance up wind from the target as the
spotter chute is downwind.
4. Turn on final – Use the SEARCH AND RESCUE AIRDROP
Checklist (PERSONNEL DEPLOYMENT Checklist.)
