priority established in AFI 48-145, Occupational Health Program.

1.8.2.8.2. (Added) The work area/shop supervisor will review and update the chemical inventory and
MSDSs at least annually to ensure applicability and currency. Up to date MSDSs must be maintained.
If the work area/shop supervisor decides to maintain MSDSs for chemicals that are no longer in use,
they must not be maintained with currently used chemical MSDSs and must be maintained in a separate
binder, clearly labeled as MSDSs that are no longer used. MSDSs must be maintained in the proper
language(s), see paragraph 2.5.5.

1.8.2.8.4. (Added) Work area/shop supervisors are required to obtain MSDSs for new chemical
authorizations (prior to their approval for use), if an MSDS is not already available in the ESOH-MIS.

1.8.2.9.2. (Added) The work area/shop supervisor will ensure workplace operating instructions (OIs)
thoroughly describe non-routine tasks, associated hazards, and controls. OIs do not need to be prepared

must be documented in Tab E of the Workplace Specific Hazard Communication Program Binder and
maintained.

1.8.2.9.3. (Added) Work area/shop supervisors will ensure all workers review the procedures for the
non-routine task before performing theses tasks.

2.2.9.2. (Added) When new chemicals are introduced into the work area/shop, the supervisor will
contact the installation BE Flight, 435 AMDS/SGPB, to determine if the chemical should be added to
the inventory.

2.5.2.1. (Added) MSDSs will be obtained by HAZMART for all chemicals they receive and store in the
HAZMART warehouse and will forward an electronic version to the ESOH-MIS MSDS focal point.

2.5.3.1.1. (Added) The Workplace Specific Hazard Communication Program Binder or separately
maintained MSDS binder will be immediately accessible to all employees.

2.5.3.2.1. (Added) Hardcopy MSDSs will be maintained in Tab G of the Workplace Specific Hazard
Communication Program Binder or a DD Form 2861 referencing the location of MSDS maintained in
separate binder. Electronic copies may also be maintained, but will not be the primary means of
providing emergency information to the employee.

2.5.5. (Added) All MSDSs obtained must be manufacturer specific, English language MSDSs
regardless of the chemical’s country of origin or the nationality of work area/shop worker’s. In
accordance with the Environmental Final Governing Standards for Germany, each MSDS shall also be
maintained in the predominant language of the workforce (> or equal to 50%).

2.6.1.1. (Added) Labeling of hazardous chemical containers must also comply with labeling
requirements as outlined in the Environmental Final Governing Standards for Germany.

2.6.4.3. (Added) All containers of hazardous chemicals and preparations on DoD installations that are
not of U.S. origin, including compressed gas cylinders, must be labeled in German and English with the
following:

2.6.4.3.1. (Added) The internationally recognized name of the substance;

2.6.4.3.2. (Added) EEC number according to EINECS, as applicable;

2.6.4.3.3. (Added) The name, complete address and telephone number of the manufacturer, importer or
distributor/seller in charge; and the hazard symbol and hazard definition as contained in Appendix
C5.A4 of the Environmental Final Governing Standards – Germany.

2.7.1.2. (Added) Supervisors will develop and conduct Workplace Specific HAZCOM Training for
their employees. This training consists of the Initial and Supplemental training as outlined in Para.
2.7.2. This training DOES NOT apply to consumer products as described in Para. 2.2.9, radiation, or
hazardous noise.

2.7.1.2.1. (Added) Workplace Specific HAZCOM Training must be prepared using a BE, PH, Ground
Safety, and Fire Department approved template; and be approved by the unit commander. Supervisors
may use AF Form 3952s; BE Special or Routine Surveys; BE Certified PPE listings; BE recommended
chemical training, Technical Orders; checklists; or manufacturer specific information as sources of
information to help write this training.

2.7.1.2.2. (Added) The shop supervisor will review and update initial and supplemental Workplace
Specific HAZCOM Training at least annually.

2.8.1.1. (Added) Cross-referencing must be accomplished by linking the chemical on the chemical
inventory and its respective MSDS with a simple coding scheme, such as numbering. Example: A
number is assigned to each chemical and documented on the inventory and then the MSDS is labeled
with the same number. If MSDSs are maintained in document protectors, the document protector itself
may be coded to allow for easy inventory/MSDS updates.

2.8.1.2. (Added) An inventory obtained from the ESOH-MIS is acceptable as long as it is specific to
the individual work area, identifies all hazardous chemicals used within the workplace, and is cross-
referenced with applicable MSDSs.

2.8.1.3. (Added) At a minimum, the inventory must list the identity of each hazardous chemical used in
the work area by name, stock or part number, and manufacturer as it appears on the MSDS. Proprietary
information will not be included on the hazardous chemical inventory.

2.8.1.4. (Added) The hazardous chemical inventory may not be hand written, but the MSDS cross
reference label may be.
