SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Significant
revisions include: Incorporating guidance previously issued under Guidance Memoranda 1, 2
and 3 to the 23 March 2012 version of AFI 90-201; reorganization of chapters; new chapters for
the Management Inspection (MI), Unit Effectiveness Inspection (UEI) and the Commander’s
Inspection Program (CCIP); new and revised attachments to provide additional guidance to all
Airmen and inspectors. In addition to containing new/amended guidance, there are legacy terms
that are no longer used in the Air Force Inspection System (AFIS) and consequently not found
within this Instruction. Included among the most significant terms no longer used in this
Instruction are: Consolidated Unit Inspection (CUI), Compliance Inspection (CI), Readiness
Inspection (RI), Health Services Inspection (HSI), Ability to Survive and Operate (ATSO) and
Exercise Evaluation Team (EET). When a requirement is mandated for compliance at the Wing
level throughout this Instruction, the requirement is tiered, signifying the appropriate waiver
authority to the requirement and is indicated in parentheses (T-0, T-1, T-2, or T-3) following the
sentence/paragraph that drives the requirement, IAW AFI 33-360. This document provides
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                                                                  3


guidance that transforms the AFIS to emphasize command responsibility, decrease the number of
days on a wing’s calendar impacted by external inspections, and to provide greater visibility over
programs and processes executed at the wing level, while effectively meeting the challenges of
increasing efficiencies and decreasing resources.

(AFMC) This docume nt is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This
AFMC Supplement incorporates guidance that identifies the AFMC five Centers, Arnold
Engineering and Development Complex, and 66th Air Base Group as wing-equivalents for the
purposes of AFIS. Conversely, the 448th Supply Chain Management Wing, 635th Supply Chain
Operations Wing, and the 711th Human Performance Wing were identified as non-wings for the
purposes of AFIS. When a requirement is mandated for compliance at the Wing level
throughout this Instruction, the requirement is tiered, signifying the appropriate waiver authori ty
to the requirement and is indicated in parentheses (T-0, T-1, T-2, or T-3) following the
sentence/paragraph that drives the requirement, IAW AFI 33-360.

                                            Chapter 1

                     GENERAL GUIDANCE AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Applicability. Unless otherwise stated, this Instruction applies to all inspections, as defined
in paragraph 1.2.2, conducted on or by any United States Air Force (USAF) organization,
including those forces assigned/apportioned to Combatant Commands.
1.2. Overview.
     1.2.1. The Air Force Inspection System. The AFIS is an integrated, synchronized system of
     inspections conducted on behalf of the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF), the Chief of
     Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) and commanders at all levels.
        1.2.1.1. Inspection is an inherent function of command exercised at every level to
        evaluate readiness, economy, efficiency, and state of discipline. Inspection preparation is
        inherently wasteful if not directly aligned with mission readiness. Units will be
        inspection ready when commanders focus on mission readiness and on building a culture
        of disciplined compliance in which every Airman does his/her job right the first time and
        when no one is looking. The intent of the IG is to continuously improve the AFIS so
        there is an ever-shrinking difference--both real and perceived--between mission readiness
        and inspection readiness.
     1.2.2. Inspection. An inspection is any effort to evaluate an organization, function or
     process by any means or method, including surveys, interviews, assessments, evaluations and
     audits, excluding audits conducted under the authority of the Secretary of the Air Force
     Auditor General (SAF/AG), and those audit activities conducted under the authority of the
     Secretary of the Air Force Comptroller (SAF/FM) specifically for the purposes of achieving
     audit readiness in accordance with the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan.
     Inspections include special visits, technical inspections, special one-time inspections,
     inspections required by law or for the exercise of command responsibilities, and inspections
     approved by the Secretary of the Air Force Inspector General (SAF/IG; TIG) which are
     conducted by functional staff (Functional) entities to provide or obtain technical information
     or assistance.
     1.2.3. It is Air Force policy that commanders at wing level and below receive at least one IG
     inspection report during their command tour. This includes all Active Duty, Reserve, and
     Air National Guard units.
     1.2.4. Inspections are the responsibility of commanders at all levels IAW Title 10 United
     States Code (USC) § 8583, Requirement of Exemplary Conduct. Inspections are conducted
     by a commander, or on behalf of a commander, on their staff and subordinate
     units/organizations. Inspections are performed by authorities inside the inspected unit (i.e.,
     Internal Inspections) and outside the inspected unit (i.e., External Inspections).
     1.2.5. When differences arise concerning inspections governed by this Instruction
     (prioritized requirements, duplicative inspections, frequency, scope, etc.), this publication
     will take precedence in these matters over other Air Force policy and guidance.
1.3. Purpose of the AFIS. The purpose of the AFIS is threefold:
     1.3.1. To enable and strengthen commanders’ effectiveness and efficiency.
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                             9


   1.3.2. To motivate and promote military discipline, improved unit performance, and
   management excellence up and down the chain of command, in units and staffs.
   1.3.3. To identify issues interfering with effectiveness, efficiency, compliance, discipline,
   readiness, performance, surety and management excellence.
1.4. Objectives of the AFIS.
   1.4.1. The AFIS is focused on assessing and reporting on a unit’s readiness, economy,
   efficiency, effectiveness and state of discipline to execute assigned missions. The AFIS
   gives SECAF, CSAF and commanders at all levels an independent assessment of:
       1.4.1.1. A unit’s compliance with established directives and ability to execute its
       assigned mission, leadership effectiveness, management performance, and aspects of unit
       culture and command climate.
       1.4.1.2. A unit’s ability to find, analyze, report and fix deficiencies.
       1.4.1.3. A unit’s ability to prevent fraud and minimize waste and abuse.
   1.4.2. The AFIS gives major commands (MAJCOM), National Guard Bureau (NGB) and
   Headquarters Air Force (HAF) Functionals an independent assessment of functional
   effectiveness and compliance in the field, and of the adequacy of organization, policy,
   guidance, training and resources.
   1.4.3. The AFIS provides a mechanism for senior AF leaders to direct a targeted, more
   detailed and thorough inspection of specific programs, organizations, or issues.
1.5. Roles and Responsibilities.
   1.5.1. Secretary of the Air Force, Inspector General (SAF/IG).

           reports.
           1.5.7.8.3. MAJCOM/IGs will support the NSI PRG, as applicable.
        1.5.7.9. (Added-AFMC) Augme ntee Inspector Program for Unit Effectiveness
        Inspections (UEI).
           1.5.7.9.1. (Added-AFMC) Purpose. HQ AFMC/IG uses augmentee inspectors, as
           needed, to supplement functional expertise of the inspection team. Augmentee
           inspectors are vital to inspection success and continuous process improvement
           throughout AFMC. HQ AFMC/IG primarily selects augmentee inspectors from
           within AFMC and will provide all needed training.
           1.5.7.9.2. (Added-AFMC) Benefit. Augmentee inspectors provide enhanced cross-
           tell within AFMC by sharing recommended improvement areas with inspected units.
           The augmentee inspectors also observe inspected units’ strengths that they then take
           back and implement within their own unit. Additionally, these augmentee inspectors
           gain unique insight into IG internal processes and inspection techniques that could
           provide significant benefit to their unit Self-Assessment Programs.
           1.5.7.9.3. (Added-AFMC) Functional Staff Responsibilities. When requested by
           the HQ AFMC/IG, HQ AFMC FAMs will identify augmentees from the field suitable
           for a specific inspection. HQ AFMC/IG will send requests for augmentee inspectors
           to the functional staff NLT 60 days prior to the start of the applicable inspection.
     1.5.8. National Guard Bureau Inspector General (NGB-IG).
        1.5.8.1. The NGB-IG will not conduct inspections under the AFIS.
        1.5.8.2. In accordance with Title 32 USC § 105, the SECAF shall execute inspections, by
        Inspectors General of the Regular Air Force, upon ANG units.
           1.5.8.2.1. NGB-IG and MAJCOM ANG IG advisors assist gaining MAJCOM/IG
           Gatekeepers with deconfliction between MAJCOM/IG inspection schedules and
           ANG unit Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF), mobilization and force structure
           changes.
        1.5.8.3. NGB-IG acts in a liaison capacity to SAF/IG and MAJCOM/IGs for inspection
        policy related to the ANG.
        1.5.8.4. As required by MAJCOM/IGs, NGB-IG resolves inspection deficiencies levied
        against NGB FAMs. Utilize IGEMS to facilitate MAJCOM/IG inspection deficiency
        processing.
        1.5.8.5. As required by MAJCOM/IGs, NGB-IG coordinates Corrective Action Plans
        (CAPs) with NGB FAMs.
     1.5.9. All MAJCOM/NGB/FOA/DRU Functional Area Managers (FAMs).
        1.5.9.1. Monitor and assess MICT data from units to maintain situational awareness of
        potential problem areas.
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                             17


        1.5.9.1.1. MAJCOM FAMs will also review inspection deficiencies identified in
        IGEMS to identify trends and guidance issues. Take appropriate actions to correct
        identified issues.
     1.5.9.2. Employ AF Smart Operations for the 21st Century (AFSO21) tools for large-
     scale corrective actions. AFSO21 tools can be found in the AFSO21 playbook or on the
     AFSO21          AF        Portal     website:              https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
     af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s6925EC13515C0FB5E044080020E329A
     9
     1.5.9.3. Coordinate and approve Corrective Action Plans, on behalf of MAJCOM/CC,
     for unit-level CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT deficiencies and all MAJCOM-level
     deficiencies. In addition, MAJCOM FAMs will consult with the HAF Functional, as
     required, to ensure proper interpretation of AF (or higher) policy.
     1.5.9.4. If absolutely necessary, supplement HAF prioritized inspection requirements
     with MAJCOM/NGB/FOA/DRU-specific requirements. Coordinate all additional
     MAJCOM/NGB-desired             HAF-level      requirements      with       applicable
     HAF/MAJCOM/NGB/FOA/DRU FAM.
     1.5.9.5. Ensure all inspection-type visits are approved by the Gatekeeper. These include
     all visits to assess, audit, certify, accredit or evaluate a unit. Additional visits such as
     Staff Assistance Visits (SAVs) must be expressly requested by the unit commander.
     These visits should be synchronized with other visits or inspections to the maximum
     extent possible by the Gatekeeper.
     1.5.9.6. May develop and maintain MAJCOM/NGB/FOA/DRU-specific inspection
     requirements where no HAF Functional inspection requirements exist for that functional
     area and load self-assessment checklist(s) into MICT.
     1.5.9.7. Develop MAJCOM/NGB/FOA/DRU supplements to SACs in accordance with
     guidance in paragraph 5.7 of this publication, as required.
     1.5.9.8. Provide or help identify and arrange for inspector augmentees with functional
     expertise as requested by MAJCOM/IG.
     1.5.9.9. In conjunction with the appropriate MAJCOM/IG, determine units to be
     inspected based on the official AF list of NWRM NSNs. See Attachment 3 (A4
     inspection requirements) for specific NWRM inspection guidance.
     1.5.9.10. Personnel permitting, conduct Staff Assistance Visits (SAV) when requested by
     a commander. SAVs may help a unit better understand the intent of higher headquarters
     policy and allow Functional staffs an opportunity to provide training to the unit. SAVs
     help MAJCOMs and HAF Functional staffs identify potential resource constraints and
     develop accurate guidance/policy. SAVs are conducted by MAJCOM or HAF Functional
     staffs and only at the request of the unit commander. All SAVs will be coordinated with
     the MAJCOM Gatekeeper (NGB-IGD for ANG). SAVs will not be given a rating and
     will not be used as a tool to prepare a unit for a formal IG inspection. SAVs will not be
     mandated by AFI.
     1.5.9.11. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC FAMs appointed by the HQ AFMC/IG as
     Inspection Functional Leads (e.g., HC, HO, JA, PA, IP, etc), to satisfy HQ AFMC/IG
18                                                  AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


        inspection requirements, will also assist in the semi-annual reporting of deficiencies,
        strengths, and analytical trends within their functional areas. Inspection Functional Leads
        will record inspection deficiency and strength data within the 1 Jan – 30 Jun and 1 Jul –
        31 Dec reporting periods, as well as assess 24-month deficiency trends for a consolidated
        AFMC Semi-Annual Inspection Analysis and Trend Report.
     1.5.10. Non-IG AF Inspection, and Accreditation and Certification Teams (see
     Attachment 2). Each non-IG AF inspection, accreditation or certification team will
     designate a scheduling point of contact (POC) in writing to AFIA. The representative must
     have the authority to approve inspection schedule changes on behalf of the inspecting entity.
     Each of these inspections, accreditations or certifications will be synchronized through the
     appropriate Gatekeeper (see paragraph 2.9.1).
        1.5.10.1. HAF and MAJCOM Functionals will eliminate non-IG inspections of Wings
        (as defined in paragraph 2.2) IAW Program Action Directive (PAD) 13-01. The Air
        Force Inspection System Implementation Tiger Team (AITT) will coordinate HAF and
        MAJCOM Functionals’ actions to ensure a deliberate, risk-mitigated phase-out of non-IG
        inspections by 1 Oct 14 IAW PAD 13-01 direction and MAJCOM-unique concerns.
     1.5.11. Statutory Teams (see Attachment 2). The Judge Advocate General (TJAG), The
     Auditor General (TAG) and The Inspector General (TIG) have statutory authority and
     responsibility to conduct inspections and audits which must guarantee independence, instill
     confidence in the system, and be free of any appearance of undue influence. Each statutory
     inspection team will designate a scheduling point of contact (POC) in writing to AFIA.
     TJAG, TAG, TIG and their authorized representatives must coordinate their inspections and
     audits with the appropriate Gatekeeper. Gatekeepers do not have the authority to
     approve/disapprove Article 6 inspections (TJAG), Air Force Audit Agency audits (TAG) nor
     AFIA and SAF/IGI inspections (TIG-directed); however, Gatekeepers have the most
     comprehensive view of unit activities and can facilitate optimum scheduling.
     1.5.12. Article 6 Part I Inspectors. All judge advocates and paralegals selected to conduct
     Article 6 Part I inspections will be appointed by TJAG and must attend the USAF Basic
     Inspector course (UEI) and/or other equivalent training as determined by TJAG. Once
     properly trained, JA inspectors serve at the discretion of TJAG. Inspection requirements,
     policies, and procedures for Article 6 Inspections will be determined by TJAG.
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                          19


                                         Chapter 2

                               INSPECTION GUIDELINES

2.1. Introduction. The AFIS consists of three synergistic inspections designed to evaluate
different levels of command in the Air Force. Each inspection is designed to complement the
other two, relying on the input and output of the other inspections for maximum effectiveness
(see Figure 2.1). Subsequent chapters in this Instruction describe each inspection in further
detail.

Figure 2.1. The Air Force Inspection System (AFIS).




2.2. Definition of “Wing”. For the purposes of this Instruction, the term “Wing” refers to an
organization with a Commander’s Inspection Program (CCIP), and upon which a Unit
Effectiveness Inspection (UEI) is conducted. Throughout this Instruction, the term “Wing” is a
substitute for the following terms: Wing, DRU, FOA (exception: AFISRA will act as a
MAJCOM inspecting equivalent for the purposes of the AF Inspection System.), and Wing-
equivalent. MAJCOM/CCs determine which organizations should be considered “Wing-
equivalents” for the purpose of the AF Inspection System.
   2.2.1. (Added-AFMC) AFMC has 14 CCIPs at seven wings (i.e., 72d Air Base Wing
   [ABW], 75 ABW, 78 ABW, 88 ABW, 377 ABW, 96th Test Wing [TW], and 412 TW) and
   seven wing-equivalents (i.e., 66th Air Base Group, Arnold Engineering and Development
   Complex, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, Air
   Force Research Laboratory, Air Force Sustainment Center, and Air Force Test Center).
   2.2.2. (Added-AFMC) The 448th Supply Chain Management Wing, 635th Supply Chain
   Operations Wing, and the 711th Human Performance Wing are non-wings for the purposes
   of AFIS; therefore, these wings do not have a standalone CCIP.
 20                                                 AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


      2.2.3. (Added-AFMC) The five Center IGs have the additional role of serving as the
      functional lead for their subordinate Wing/Wing-equivalent IGs. As the functional lead,
      Center IGs will provide Center policy, oversight, standardization, Gatekeeping,
      IGEMS/MICT administration oversight, and approval authority for UEI significant and
      critical deficiencies sent to HQ AFMC/IG for closure. (T-2)
2.3. Major Graded Areas (MGAs). MGAs represent key processes, procedures and
requirements based on either public law, executive orders, directives and instructions. The UEI
and CCIP will assess four MGAs: managing resources, leading people, improving the unit and
executing the mission (see Figure 2.2 and Attachment 4). See Chapter 3 for Management
Inspection MGAs.

Figure 2.2. UEI and CCIP Major Graded Areas.




2.4. Inspection Types.
      2.4.1. Internal Inspections. Internal Inspections are the foundation of the AFIS, promoting
      responsibility and accountability within the unit and allowing commanders to control the
      depth, scope and frequency of inspections.
         2.4.1.1. IAW 10 USC § 8583, commanders will conduct Internal Inspections and
         actively support and participate in External Inspections affecting their unit(s). (T-0)
         2.4.1.2. Commanders are responsible for ensuring compliance within their units. CCIP
         will focus on detecting non-compliance with all applicable governing directives and on
         unit effectiveness in the four MGAs in Figure 2.2 (T-1) Inspections should be prioritized
         based on the risk created by undetected non-compliance.
         2.4.1.3. For the purposes of this instruction, any inspection conducted by a Wing on a
         subordinate agency is considered an internal inspection. Inspections conducted as part of
         the Commander’s Inspection Program are considered internal inspections.
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                             21


   2.4.2. External Inspections. External inspections can serve two purposes. First, they can
   provide an independent, transparent and accountable assessment of readiness, economy,
   efficiency and state of discipline. Additionally, external inspections can be used to validate
   and verify the internal inspections process.
      2.4.2.1. External inspections include:
          2.4.2.1.1. IG Inspections, including the Unit Effectiveness Inspection. The UEI is an
          external, continual evaluation of Wing performance based on the four MGAs in
          Figure 2.2 The UEI serves both purposes of an external inspection: providing an
          independent assessment of Wing effectiveness and validating/verifying the
          Commander’s Inspection Program. The UEI is not focused on detecting shop-level
          non-compliance. Instead, the UEI is focused on identifying areas where the risks
          from undetected non-compliance are greatest—helping the Wing CC identify blind
          spots, poorly focused or misaimed sensors in his/her CCIP. Some of these high-risk
          areas are identified in Attachment 3, the authoritative source of HAF-level
          inspection requirements. MAJCOM/IG teams will build an inspection sampling
          strategy based on, as a minimum, the mandatory areas identified in Attachme nt 3 for
          each unit.
          2.4.2.1.2. Non-Air Force Inspections.
          2.4.2.1.3. Non-IG Inspections.
          2.4.2.1.4. Accreditation and Certification Inspections.
2.5. Inspector General Authority. SAF/IG and its subordinate inspectors (to include AFIA,
MAJCOM IG and Wing IG) derive their authority from The Inspector General's statutory and
regulatory authority.
   2.5.1. Inspector Certification. The IG (MAJCOM or Wing) will certify all inspectors. (T-1)
   All IG inspectors (to include inspector augmentees and Wing Inspection Team (WIT)
   members) will be properly trained (see Chapter 9), certified in writing and sworn-in by oath
   (See Figure 9.1). (T-1)
      2.5.1.1. MAJCOM/IGs can delegate to inspection Team Chiefs the authority to certify
      inspector augmentees on an interim basis for one month. MAJCOM/IGs will review
      Team Chief interim certifications and approve/disapprove full certification based on
      completion of requirements and the Team Chief’s recommendation.
      2.5.1.2. All certifications--interim and full--will be documented and filed IAW the AF
      Records Disposition Schedule in AFRIMS. Until certified, the inspector must perform
      their inspection duties under the direct supervision of a certified inspector. Assigned IG
      inspectors must be certified within 6 months of being assigned to the IG. (T-1)
      2.5.1.3. Certified IG inspectors will carry appropriate credentials. (T-1)
      2.5.1.4. Wing IG, MAJCOM IG, AFIA and SAF/IG inspectors with nuclear inspection
      responsibilities will also complete the AF Nuclear Surety Inspector Course if their duties
      involve inspection of a nuclear surety mission. (T-1)
   2.5.2. IG Oath. Officers, NCOs, and DAF civilians serving as inspectors will take the IG
   oath. (T-1) The oath reminds all IG personnel of the special trust and confidence inherent in
22                                                   AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


     their positions, and of the need for impartial, independent evaluation on behalf of the
     commander. (See Figure 9.1) (T-1)
        2.5.2.1. Administering the Oath. The commander, as the directing authority, should
        administer the oath to the command IG (at a minimum) and every IG serving in the IG
        staff section, preferably in a public forum where a significant portion of the command
        may witness it. If the commander is unable to administer the oath to all IGs in the staff
        section, he may delegate this authority to the command IG. Assigned IGs will administer
        the oath to IG inspector augmentees. Contractor personnel working in an IG staff section
        will not take the IG oath.
        2.5.2.2. Re-administering the Oath. When a commander departs the command, the
        command IG may choose to execute another IG oath with the incoming commander as a
        way to express to that new commander the special relationship shared by both
        individuals. However, a new oath is not required. If an IG moves to an IG staff section in
        another command, the IG will execute a new oath with his or her new commander. All
        individuals with prior IG experience who are nominated for a second, nonconsecutive IG
        detail must execute the IG oath upon arriving at his or her new command.
     2.5.3. Valid Period of Inspector Authority. An inspector’s authority is valid only for the
     period of time he/she is a certified inspector and performing official inspection activities.
     2.5.4. Use of Contractors as IG inspectors. Contractors are prohibited from acting in the
     capacity of an IG inspector since IG duties are an inherently governmental function per the
     Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 and IAW the Federal Activities
     Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act of 1998. However, contractors may participate in an
     inspection as subject-matter experts (SME) gathering information for, or providing advice,
     opinions, recommendations or ideas to a government member of the IG unless there is an
     Organizational Conflict of Interest resulting from other contracts held by the contractor. This
     may be determined by the contracting office supporting the unit being inspected. While
     contractors can act as “sensors” providing information to the IG, the IG must make all
     decisions related to the inspection, including schedule, sample selection, deficiency
     assignment, deficiency severity, MGA grades and overall ratings. Use of contractors must be
     in compliance with DOD Instruction 1100.22, Guidance for Determining Workforce Mix.
     2.5.4. (AFMC) Contractors are required to complete a nondisclosure agreement IAW FAR
     9.5 unless otherwise provided for under terms of their contract.
     2.5.5. Bargaining unit employees may be assigned to an Inspector General office (wing,
     MAJCOM or HAF) as full-time certified inspectors or in a clerical/administrative support
     role. Bargaining unit employees may also, on a part-time basis, act as certified IG inspector
     augmentees. IGs will ensure bargaining unit members do not act as investigators in any way
     since there are conflicts that may arise in a number of situations. (T-0)
     2.5.6. Access to Information and Spaces. To carry out their responsibilities, Air Force IGs
     shall have expeditious and unrestricted access to and, when required, be given copies of all
     records, reports, investigations, audits, reviews, documents, papers, recommendations, or
     other material available to or within any USAF activity. While performing official duties as
     an inspector, IGs will be granted access to any and all documents, records, and evidentiary
     materials needed to discharge their duties, to include data stored in electronic repositories.
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                              23


  Some examples are classified documents, records of board proceedings, acquisition
  information, medical records, medical quality assurance records, drug and alcohol records,
  financial records, evaluation reports, back-channel messages, security dossiers, criminal
  investigation reports (as permitted by law and applicable regulations), and financial
  disclosure statements. This authority includes direct access to pertinent extracts as allowed
  by applicable regulations.
     2.5.6.1. (Added-AFMC) Permissions and access to specific program information
     systems will be granted to the IG personnel and their assigned augmentees, when needed,
     for the purpose of inspection research and planning and/or virtual inspections.
     Applicable non-disclosure agreements and computer program access forms will be
     obtained by the IG Functional Lead and submitted to the inspected unit for their files and
     coordination, as needed.
  2.5.7. Access to medical records. When accessing medical records, IGs must remain aware
  that health care information is sensitive medical information, is protected by Public Law
  104–191, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and must be
  protected. Accordingly, IGs must comply with all HIPAA release forms or requests and
  maintain the information in a safe, secure, and confidential manner.
  2.5.8. Restricted access. IGs are not authorized access to material subject to the attorney
  client privilege or other legal privileged information involving DoD personnel individually
  represented by legal counsel, such as by an Area Defense Counsel or legal assistance
  attorney. However, any such privilege can be waived by the represented individual.
  2.5.9. Access to classified or sensitive information. As part of an inspection, investigation or
  other directed inquiry, assigned IGs have a "need to know" and will forward a visit request
  through the Joint Personnel Adjudication System to the security management office
  determined by the unit, for further distribution throughout the unit. Access to classified
  information will be IAW AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management. If
  compartmentalization or classification restrictions preclude immediate access to information
  required by an IG, the denying commander will immediately report the situation to the
  appropriate access-control authority and obtain an access-eligibility determination. If this
  authority does not grant access to the information, the IG will notify the commander and
  SAF/IGI of the situation. The notice to SAF/IGI will include the location, date, and
  command; scope of the assistance inquiry, inspection, or investigation; who denied access;
  who verified denial and approved denial; and the reason access was denied.
  2.5.10. Special Access Programs. The SAF/IG is responsible for performing program
  security, inspection, investigation and counterintelligence functions for all Air Force SAPs
  and for maintaining a sufficient cadre of inspectors, investigators, special agents, analysts
  and program security officers to do so.
     2.5.10.1. Through AFOSI, SAF/IG will appoint a SAP Security Director to execute SAP
     security and security oversight responsibilities, under the authority of the Air Force SAP
     Central Office, for all Air Force SAPs and non-AF SAPs where the Air Force has been
     assigned responsibility. The SAF/IG or a designated representative may attend any
     Special Access Required Programs Oversight Committee, Special Programs Review
     Group and SAP Oversight Review Board meeting.
24                                                 AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


        2.5.10.2. SAF/IG may propose an inspection, assessment or management review of a
        SAP or SAP function to the Secretary of the Air Force after obtaining the views of
        SAF/AA.       SECAF approval of a proposed SAF/IG inspection, assessment or
        management review establishes SAP access “need to know” for the SAF/IG assigned and
        credentialed personnel required to accomplish such inspection, assessment or
        management review activities. In addition to the “need to know”, these credentialed
        personnel must meet the SAP access eligibility requirements outlined in AFI 16-701,
        Special Access Programs as do individuals who conduct SAF/IG investigations (SAF/IG
        investigations establish their own “need to know”).
        2.5.10.3. Unless the Secretary directs otherwise, all SAF/IG inspections, assessments or
        management reviews of a SAP or SAP activity will be coordinated with the Director,
        SAF/AAZ.
        2.5.10.4. (Added-AFMC) Special Access Program (SAP). AFMC units operating
        SAPs are subject to HQ AFMC/IG inspections.
            2.5.10.4.1. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC/IG will conduct SAP inspections in
            coordination with the AFMC SAPMO (HQ AFMC/A5J) and in accordance with
            applicable MOAs, Air Force and DoD policies and instructions to SAPs. HQ
            AFMC/A5J is the designated interface between SAP field units and the AFMC
            functional staff, including HQ AFMC/IG. Via secure channels, HQ AFMC/IG, in
            coordination with HQ AFMC/A5J, will notify the Assistant to the Commander for
            Special Programs (ACSP) for each respective Center and/or highest level of unit
            leadership with appropriate accesses concerning impending inspections.
            2.5.10.4.2. (Added-AFMC) Inspection Report Handling. The SAP inspection
            report will be an independent report. HQ AFMC/IG will draft, finalize, and
            appropriately distribute the report. Report disposition will be IAW AFI 33-364,
            Records Disposition-Procedures and Responsibilities, and will be maintained within
            appropriate channels and made available only to those personnel with the appropriate
            program access.
            2.5.10.4.3. (Added-AFMC) Reporting, Tracking, and Closing Deficiencies. The
            Corrective Action process applies to SAP offices with the exception of the use of
            IGEMS. The inspected SAP unit will answer deficiencies on an AFMC Form 21,
            Instructions For HQ AFMC IG Deficiencies Response. Replies will be sent via
            appropriate program channels to HQ AFMC/IG via HQ AFMC/A5J.
            2.5.10.4.4. (Added-AFMC) Unit Self-Assessment Program (USAP). SAP offices
            will comply with USAP, as applicable, per program management guides. Exception:
            SAP Offices will not send their USAP reports, deficiencies, or corrective action plans
            (CAP) to the Center USAP Manager, Command USAP Manager in HQ AFMC/IG, or
            to HQ AFMC/IG personnel via email. USAP reports, deficiencies, and CAPs will be
            sent to HQ AFMC/IG through HQ AFMC/A5J via SAP secure channels.
     2.5.11. Access Control and Routine Searches. Inspector General personnel properly
     identifying themselves as representatives of the IG and properly identified on a signed,
     authenticated IG Entry Authority List (EAL) shall be authorized entry to Protection Level
     resources via established entry procedures identified in AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                                25


   (FOUO) and DOD S-5210.41-M, Volumes 1-3_AFMAN 31-108, The Air Force Nuclear
   Weapon Security Manual.
2.6. Inspection Frequency. See Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6 of this instruction for specific
inspection frequency.
2.7. Air Force Inspection Scheduling Process. The purpose of the AF Inspection Scheduling
Process is to synchronize inspection efforts to maximize unit training days and inspection
resource utilization; build out-year schedules; and align non-AF inspection requirements with AF
inspection schedules.
   2.7.1. Gatekeepers will establish inspection schedules within their MAJCOM and publish
   IAW paragraph 1.5.7.6. Schedules will include: two years from the current date and a
   tentative schedule for the following two years, accumulating in a four year total. For
   example, by 1 Mar 2014, AFIA will publish the AF Inspectio n Schedule via an access-
   controlled website for FY15-16 and a tentative schedule for FY 17-18.
   2.7.2. NGB-IG and MAJCOM ANG IG advisors will assist gaining MAJCOM/IG
   Gatekeepers with deconfliction between MAJCOM/IG inspection schedules and ANG unit
   AEF, mobilization and force structure changes.
2.8. Inspection Notification. In addition to scheduled Capstone events and in line with the
overall intent to evaluate daily unit effectiveness, eliminate effort wasted on inspection
preparation and validate that Mission ready is Inspection ready, no- and min-notice inspections,
through sampling, are an integral aspect of the AFIS. No- or min-notice often refers to the time
between initial inspection notification and the arrival of the team for an in-brief. However, no-
or min-notice inspections are also effectively produced through sampling--when the IG selects
the program, team, or Airmen to be inspected. No- and min-notice inspection sampling occurs
throughout the Unit Effectiveness Inspection's continual evaluation phase, and through the
validation/verification component of the Commander's Inspection Program. (For ANG: If
specific programs or events are to be inspected MAJCOM/IGs must consider available unit
manpower and resources when coordinating notification timeframes.) Commanders will
determine the amount of notice to give inspected units. (T-1)
   2.8.1. Trusted Agents. SAF/IGI, AFIA, AFSEC/SEW, NGB-IG and MAJCOM/AFISRA/
   OSI Gatekeepers, and Functional inspection team scheduling POCs who participate in the AF
   Inspection Scheduling Process are trusted agents for the Air Force Inspection Schedule.
       2.8.1.1. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC/IG may appoint/use trusted agent(s) prior to and
       after the official notification of an inspection, as needed, to obtain additional details, to
       help plan, support and/or execute an inspection. Trusted agents will not disclose any
       information concerning upcoming inspections, except with the HQ AFMC/IG or other
       HQ AFMC/IG appointed trusted agents. Trusted agents will make every attempt to
       obtain the requested information for HQ AFMC/IG. If unable to produce the information,
       they will nominate additional trusted agents, with access to the needed information, to the
       HQ AFMC/IG, for approval.
   2.8.2. ARC units will participate in MAJCOM/ IG no-notice and min-notice NSIs and
   NORIs.
 26                                                 AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


      2.8.3. MAJCOM/IGs must recognize there may be limited availability of ARC unit
      personnel in some functional areas when initiating no/min-notice inspections.
      2.8.4. (Added-AFMC) Observers for Unit Effectiveness Inspections (UEI).
         2.8.4.1. (Added-AFMC) The inspected unit may allow observers from other units to
         observe the inspection processes on a non-interference basis. The inspected unit is
         responsible for all unit-sponsored observers. Observers are not permitted to attend HQ
         AFMC/IG team meetings or view internal HQ AFMC/IG processes. The inspected unit
         must inform the HQ AFMC/IG in advance of the specific number of observers, the
         activities they may observe, and rules of engagement they must obey. Military observers
         will wear appropriate military uniforms during all periods of observation. Civilian
         observers will wear business attire. The inspected unit will provide identification badges
         for observers. (T-2)
         2.8.4.2. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC/IG may invite observers and will be responsible
         for all observers they invite. HQ AFMC/IG will determine observers’ level of access to
         inspection activities and internal HQ AFMC/IG processes. HQ AFMC/IG sponsored
         observers will be credentialed by the HQ AFMC/IG and should be transparent to the
         inspected unit.
2.9. MAJCOM Inspection Programs—General Guidelines. MAJCOM/IGs will establish
inspection programs consistent with Mission Directive responsibilities and in accordance with
AF inspection guidelines outlined in this Instruction.
      2.9.1. Gatekeeper. Gatekeepers at all levels must ensure the inspection system is able to
      independently and efficiently inspect units on behalf of the command chain. Gatekeepers
      ensure a commander’s priorities take precedence over non-mission-essential activities of any
      unit/organization. Gatekeepers have the authority to approve or disapprove, schedule, de-
      conflict and eliminate duplication between all inspection-type activities on behalf of their
      commander. Gatekeepers do not have authority to approve or disapprove TJAG Article 6
      inspections, TAG-directed audits, TIG-directed inspections by AFIA or SAF/IGI, or
      inspection-type activity conducted by properly authorized DoD or other USG agencies (e.g.,
      OIG, DOD; GAO, DISA; DTRA). In these cases, Gatekeepers should attempt to de-conflict
      the inspections by offering optimum windows for the appropriate units. MAJCOM/CCs
      should delegate MAJCOM Gatekeeper authority and responsibility to their MAJCOM/IG to
      perform Gatekeeper functions for all inspection-type activity within their MAJCOM.
         2.9.1.1. MAJCOM Gatekeeper functions include the ability to establish/maintain
         situational awareness and to synchronize and de-conflict unit inspections, assessments
         and evaluations within their MAJCOM. MAJCOM Gatekeepers also review subordinate
         wing inspection schedules for continuous evaluation of local exercise scenarios.
         Gatekeeping unit inspections may include tracking organizations below the wing level as
         needed.
             2.9.1.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Gatekeeper Meeting. The AFMC Gatekeeper will chair
             and conduct a monthly Gatekeeper meeting attended by the appropriate HQ AFMC 2-
             letter POCs. In addition, strategic Gatekeeper meetings will be held on a quarterly
             basis to deconflict or consolidate upcoming inspections.
                 2.9.1.1.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Weekly Gatekeeper Meetings. These meetings
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                           27


            are designed to provide insight regarding upcoming inspections, audits, and SAVs
            within the Command, as well as to address and resolve key issues that could delay
            or hinder the scheduled inspections within the 12-month period. Additionally,
            AFMC Gatekeeper will provide visibility on Air Force Global Strike Command
            nuclear inspections to ensure that the scheduling process prioritizes the nuclear
            enterprise inspections above other inspection types. Other HHQ inspection
            owners and HQ AFMC 2-letter designated POCs should attend the monthly
            Gatekeeper meetings.
            2.9.1.1.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Quarterly            AFMC        Strategic     Gatekeeper
            Meeting. The AFMC Strategic Gatekeeper meeting is designed to provide AFMC
            Leadership a strategic look into future inspection, audit, and SAV events.
            Scheduled inspection events will be reviewed to determine ways to reduce the
            inspection footprint and maximize inspection whitespace for a given location.
            Key members of the HQ AFMC staff (i.e., HQ AFMC 3-letter Inspection
            Division Chiefs) will be invited to attend this quarterly strategic review.
        2.9.1.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Center Commanders will appoint a Center Gatekeeper
        and Base-level Gatekeeper(s) as applicable for Center host installations. (T-2) For
        example, AFTC will have a Center Gatekeeper primarily responsible for AFTC
        organizations on non-AFMC installations (e.g., 96 TG at Holloman AFB) and Base-
        level Gatekeepers for Eglin, Edwards, and Arnold AFBs to gate keep for the entire
        installation, to include tenant organizations. The AFTC Gatekeeper and Edwards
        Installation Gatekeeper can be dual-hatted. Each Center/Base-level Gatekeeper is
        required to sign a non-disclosure agreement.
        2.9.1.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Center Gatekeeper will maintain oversight of the Base-
        level Gatekeeper Calendar to ensure all major inspections, audits, SAVs, major
        events, and local inspections are added to the AFIA Wing Gatekeeper Calendar and
        that the information is up to date. Calendars will be built for current calendar year
        plus one for a total of two years in order to deconflict future inspections at the base
        and MAJCOM level. (T-2)
     2.9.1.2. Gatekeepers will only approve access to their installations:
        2.9.1.2.1. IAW their MAJCOM commander’s guidance.
        2.9.1.2.2. For inspections listed in Attachment 2.
        2.9.1.2.3. For events requested by the unit commander (e.g., award teams and SAVs)
     2.9.1.3. For requests that do not meet the above criteria, Gatekeepers should deny access
     to the installation and direct the requestor to follow the procedures in paragraph 2.22 to
     request the activity be vetted by the Inspection System Governance Process for
     consideration to be added to Attachment 2.
     2.9.1.4. Non-AF Agency Access to Inspect. Any non-AF agency (DOD, DTRA, DISA,
     GAO, etc.) requesting access to an installation to conduct inspection-type activity should
     contact AFIA and request liaison with appropriate MAJCOM Gatekeeper. Gatekeepers
     should make every effort to accommodate the request while balancing the need to guard a
 28                                                  AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


         unit’s calendar whitespace through synchronization. If unable to resolve the non-AF
         agency request, AFIA will notify SAF/IGI for assistance.
         2.9.1.5. Non-AF Agency Request for Inspection Observation Access. Agencies external
         to the Air Force will coordinate requests to observe IG inspections through AFIA
         (primary) or SAF/IGI (secondary) for SAF/IG approval. Upon approval, AFIA will also
         serve as the liaison to coordinate with all external agencies requesting support and
         observer actions.
         2.9.1.6. Any agency planning to inspect, assess, evaluate, audit, assist, visit, or observe
         an Air Force unit/organization must contact the MAJCOM Gatekeeper as early as
         possible, and no later than 30 days prior to the desired visit.
             2.9.1.6.1. (Added-AFMC) All inspection requests external to a unit's responsible
             Center must be routed through the AFMC Gatekeeper. HQ AFMC directorates, field
             operating agencies and special staffs that are planning audits or SAVs must submit a
             visit request to the AFMC Gatekeeper via email to: hqafmc.ig.gate@us.af.mil no
             later than 30 days prior to scheduled visit. Center and Wing-level Gatekeepers will
             redirect all agencies requesting access to their assigned installation to the assigned
             AFMC Gatekeeper prior to approving any site visits. (T-2)
             2.9.1.6.2. (Added-AFMC) All site visit requests will include the following
             information in order to gain approval from the AFMC Gatekeeper: inspecting agency,
             purpose of the visit, base and organization to be visited, number of inspectors/auditors
             on the team, proposed date the team will be visiting a location, and the name a nd
             contact information of the requestor or Inspection/Audit POC. All visits to SAP
             activities shall follow approved DoD visit notification actions via appropriate
             channels. (T-2)
2.10. MAJCOM HQ Role in the AFIS.
      2.10.1. MAJCOM HQ will establish an effective and efficient battle rhythm to: 1) execute
      the UEI continual evaluation IAW Chapter 4; 2) identify and track action items for
      MAJCOM HQ and Wing action; 3) identify potential action items for HAF consideration;
      and 4) ensure the inspection schedule meets the commander’s requirements. The following
      battle rhythm will be used:
         2.10.1.1. Monthly. FAMs will analyze MICT data and other functional metrics to build
         awareness of unit performance in FAMs’ areas of expertise.
         2.10.1.2. Quarterly Inspection Working Group. Chaired by the MAJCOM/IG (delegable
         no lower than the Deputy IG). The members include Wing IGs and MAJCOM HQ
         deputy directors (NGB-IGD for ANG) and special staff.
         2.10.1.2. (AFMC) Quarterly Inspection Working Group will be satisfied using the
         existing AFMC Corporate Process.
         2.10.1.3. Semi-Annual Inspection Council.           Chaired by the MAJCOM/CC/CV
         (delegable no lower than a Director). The members include Wing CCs, ANGRC/CV, HQ
         Directors and Special Staff, and others as directed by MAJCOM/CC/CV.
         2.10.1.3. (AFMC) Semi-Annual Inspection Council will be satisfied using the existing
         AFMC Corporate Process.
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                                29


   2.10.2. Inspection alignment with the AEF battle rhythm. Inspections must be deconflicted
   with AEF battle rhythm, enabler unit deployments, expeditionary support deployments and
   unit force structure changes. Inspections will be tailored, as necessary, to allow requisite unit
   support to the combatant command (COCOM).                    MAJCOM/IGs will make final
   determination of scheduling and tailoring.
2.11. FOAs’ Role in Support of MAJCOMs.
   2.11.1. For areas in which a MAJCOM HQ has limited expertise due to consolidation of
   subject-matter-experts to FOAs, MAJCOM HQ and FOAs will establish processes and
   agreements as necessary to facilitate the UEI continual evaluation process. FOAs that have
   consolidated SME responsibilities on behalf of MAJCOM functional directorates will
   provide support as special staff in the Quarterly Inspection Working Group described in
   paragraph 2.10.1.2.
2.12. On-Site Inspections.
   2.12.1. All inspection authorities will consolidate inspections to avoid redundancy.
   Eliminate on-site inspections that are not mission-relevant, do not outweigh their costs, or
   detract from mission performance or readiness.
   2.12.2. When scheduling inspections for installations with units gained by multiple
   MAJCOMs, MAJCOM/IGs will coordinate the inspection schedules to conduct concurrent
   MAJCOM inspections, to the maximum extent possible.
   2.12.3. IG Reciprocity. MAJCOM and Wing IG reciprocity is an essential component of the
   AFIS. If an IG needs to inspect a geographically separated unit, he or she may request a
   collocated IG conduct the inspection on their behalf. IGs should accommodate inspection
   reciprocity requests to the maximum extent possible. Additionally, requesting IGs shall
   honor deficiencies reported by the inspecting IG as if they were their own. Reciprocity
   requests should be documented in a memorandum of agreement between the concerned
   parties.
   2.12.4. Limiting factors, simulations and deviations. The inspected unit will submit limiting
   factors (LIMFAC), simulations (SIM) and deviations (DEV) that could potentially affect the
   inspection's outcome to the inspection team chief. Any such LIMFAC, SIM, or DEV from
   authorized policy and guidance will be coordinated with the MAJCOM/IG. Approved
   LIMFACs, SIMs and DEVs which may impact inspection processes and outcomes will be
   announced to all inspectors prior to the commencement of any inspection activities.
       2.12.4.1. (Added-AFMC) Send all LIMFACs and proposed SIMs/DEVs under a single
       cover letter signed by the wing commander (or wing-equivalent commander) IAW
       Attachment 15. Pre-approved SIMs/DEVs are listed in Attachment 14. Describe the
       LIMFACs and the reason for each SIM and DEV and how mission capability will be
       demonstrated for each SIM/DEV. HQ AFMC/IG will notify the unit of the approval
       status of each request prior to the inspection start date. (T-2).
   2.12.5. Entry Authority List. The EAL will be sent to the host Unit’s Security office at the
   location of the inspection for dissemination to inspected units/organizations.
   2.12.6. Inspection Footprint. IG Team Chiefs will work with the inspected unit prior to the
   inspection to ensure there is a shared understanding of inspection constraints due to space,
 30                                                   AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


      security, escort ratio, etc. The Team Chief will attempt to minimize the inspector footprint to
      the maximum extent practical; however, the Team Chief will make the final determination on
      inspector footprint to ensure adequate access for the inspectors.
         2.12.6.1. MAJCOM/IGs will conduct periodic site visits and/or review documents and
         after action reports of unit activity in conjunction with exercises and contingencies, real -
         world operations, self-assessments, other inspection/evaluations, sampling techniques,
         and other measures of sustained performance. These measures will be used to adjust the
         breadth, duration, and incidence of on-site inspection activities.
         2.12.6.2. When practical, IG teams may deploy to forward locations and headquarters
         during exercises and contingency operations to evaluate processes and performance.
         Inspectors may observe, but will not interfere with, real world activities unless observed
         actions are in direct violation of mandated guidance or if injury to personnel and/or
         damage to equipment could occur that may cause significant mission degradation.
      2.12.7. IG Team Work Center Requirements. The MAJCOM/IG Team Chief will coordinate
      specific work center requirements with the inspected unit. Additionally, the inspected unit
      will provide at least one dedicated person for the duration of the inspection to answer and
      screen work center calls for the IG inspection team.
      2.12.8. (Added-AFMC) Temporary Exemptions. All AFMC units are subject to
      applicable HQ AFMC/IG activities unless specifically exempt as outlined below.
         2.12.8.1. (Added-AFMC) Center Commanders may request a temporary inspection
         exemption from the HQ AFMC/IG (e.g., for a specific inspection activity, or any portion
         of a specific inspection activity). Temporary exemptions to SAP Security Inspections
         may be requested to accommodate mission requirements; however, they must be
         completed within the 18-24 month inspection cycle.
         2.12.8.2. (Added-AFMC) Center Commanders may request exemptions based on the
         following or similar circumstances:
             2.12.8.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Major unit or mission changes.
             2.12.8.2.2. (Added-AFMC) Real-world contingency deployments or commitments.
             2.12.8.2.3. (Added-AFMC) Weapon system modifications or conversions requiring
             extensive personnel training or modification(s) to maintenance procedures.
             2.12.8.2.4. (Added-AFMC) Limiting factors reported in Status of Resources and
             Training System (SORTS), Defense Readiness Reporting System (DRRS) and AEF
             UTC Reporting Tool (ART).
         2.12.8.3. (Added-AFMC) Processing Exe mption Requests. Center Commanders
         exemption requests submitted to HQ AFMC/IG must include a detailed justification,
         specific activity to be exempted, and an exemption expiration date. HQ AFMC/IG will
         coordinate with applicable HQ AFMC directorate(s) before making a determination to
         approve/disapprove the temporary exemption. HQ AFMC/IG will inform AFMC/CC if
         the temporary exemption applies to the entire installation.
2.13. Selection for Performance-Based Evaluations. Inspection teams will randomly select
individuals/teams for executing performance-based evaluations in lieu of the inspected unit self-
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                             31


identifying individuals/teams for evaluation (maintain team integrity as appropriate). Inspectors
may brief applicable items from paragraph 6.10.2.2.3. to the individual(s)/team(s) being
evaluated prior to the start of the evaluation.
2.14. Inspecting Contracted Functions.
   2.14.1. Performance Work Statement (PWS). The Contracting Officer and/or Contracting
   Officer Representative (COR) will accompany the IG during inspections of contracted
   functions. (T-1) Inspectors will assess and rate contracted functions against the PWS and
   assess adequacy of the PWS to meet mission requireme nts while developing and
   implementing safeguards to prevent contractor claims resulting from inspection activities.
   Inspectors must communicate with the Contracting Officer and/or the COR to fully
   understand the scope and limitations of the contracting authorities and must work closely
   with them to prevent a possible misunderstanding or the creation of a condition that may be
   the basis of a later claim against the Government.
   2.14.2. Rating and Report. Contracted functions will be rated; however, individual
   contractors will not. Emphasis will be placed on the compliance of the function to be
   performed, not on the status of the personnel (military, civil service, or contractor)
   performing the function. Sampling of contracted activity will be coordinated through the
   Contracting Officer and/or COR. Contractors may be provided with applicable portions of
   the report IAW DOD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302, Freedom of Information Act Program.
   2.14.3. Validation. Validate observations related to contractor functions with the contracting
   officer. Deficiencies will be tracked IAW paragraph 2.18. Only the Contracting Officer can
   take formal action against the contractor for noncompliance or direct contractors to correct
   deficiencies identified during inspections.
2.15. Additional Inspections.
   2.15.1. Federal Recognition Inspection (FRI). The gaining MAJCOM will conduct a FRI
   of a state unit when the unit is being considered for federal recognition, or when asked to do
   so by the NGB-IG. Conduct the FRI according to AFI 90-201 ANGSUP, The Air Force
   Inspection System.
   2.15.2. Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT) Inspections. AFMC/IG will conduct
   BSAT compliance inspections for all units that are registered by the Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention in accordance with governing directives (DODI 5210.89_AFI 10-
   3901, Minimum Security Standards for Safeguarding Biological Select Agents and Toxin.
   The inspection is designed to evaluate a unit's compliance with applicable policies for
   laboratory operations within Biological Safety Level III facilities which store and use BSAT.
       2.15.2.1. (Added-AFMC) BSAT Inspection. Attachment 16 contains BSAT inspection
       criteria. HQ AFMC/IG will notify the inspected unit 60 days prior to the inspection. HQ
       AFMC/IG will coordinate non-Biological Personnel Reliability Program (BPRP) certified
       IG inspectors access to the BSAT laboratory and/or storage facility. This requirement
       must be coordinated with the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and HQ AFMC/A3X in
       order to accomplish inspection of the BSAT inventory.
   2.15.3. Wounded, Ill, and Injured (WII) Facility Inspections. IGs (MAJCOM or Wing)
   will conduct WII Facility Inspections, as required by National Defense Authorization Act
 32                                                   AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


      (NDAA) FY2008, House Record (H.R.) 4986, Section 1662, Access of Recovering Service
      Members to Adequate Outpatient Residential Facilities. WII Facility Inspections may be
      conducted in conjunction with other IG (MAJCOM or Wing) inspections, but will be a
      separate, distinct inspection providing a separate inspection report. WII Facility Inspections
      will utilize a 3-tier rating scale: IN COMPLIANCE, IN COMPLIANCE WITH
      COMMENTS, or NOT IN COMPLIANCE. Refer to Attachme nt 8 for specific information
      pertaining to WII inspections.
      2.15.4. Cemetery Inspections. Cemeteries identified on the DOD list as being under the
      care of the USAF will be inspected by the closest assigned Wing IG IAW requirements
      mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act, Section 592. The inspection of
      military cemeteries shall include an assessment of the items listed in Attachment 9.
2.16. Self-Assessment Checklist Fragme ntary Order (SAC FRAGO). The new inspection
system gives HAF Functionals a responsive capability to get validated/verified data directly from
units using MICT. The mechanism is an order—a Self-Assessment Checklist Fragmentary
Order (SAC FRAGO)—from VCSAF to MAJCOM and other commanders to complete a
specified checklist in MICT for a high-priority, often time-sensitive requirement. HAF
Functionals should submit a SAC FRAGO request for VCSAF approval and transmission
through normal HAF/ES coordination channels.
2.17. The Air Force Special Interest Item (SII) Program. SIIs provide a means to gather data
to evaluate the status of specific programs and conditions in the field requiring AF senior leader
attention. There should be no more than five active SIIs at any given time.
      2.17.1. SAF/IGI manages the AF SII program by coordinating AF SII topic proposals and
      obtaining SAF/IG approval; distributing approved AF SIIs to MAJCOM/IGs; compiling and
      forwarding SII data to the sponsoring agency.
      2.17.2. SAF/IGI will assess every potential SII for its impact on the nuclear enterprise and if
      necessary, coordinate with AF/A10 prior to publication.
      2.17.3. SII Sponsors. The Offices of the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Air Force,
      SAF/IG and HAF Functionals may sponsor SIIs. HAF Functional-proposed SII topics may
      be initiated at any level but must be submitted by the appropriate HAF Functional to
      SAF/IGI at safigi.workflow@pentagon.af.mil. Submit SII topic proposals in the format
      provided on the SAF/IGI Air Force Enterprise Information Systems SharePoint website.
      Coordinate with MAJCOM FAMs (to include, Guard/Reserve) prior to submitting a
      proposed AF SII.
      2.17.4. MAJCOM/IGs will receive SII notification from SAF/IGI. MAJCOM/IGs will
      notify all subordinate units/organizations (including gained ARC units) of the SII
      requirements as soon as possible following publication of the SII.
      2.17.5. MAJCOM/IGs will sample all active SIIs during formal inspections. Document the
      results of SII inspections as a separate section of the final inspection report.
      2.17.6. SII Reports. MAJCOM/IGs will document SII results in IGEMS. Units not
      receiving an IG inspection during the active period of the SII will conduct a one-time self-
      inspection on the SII topic using the self-inspection checklist and instructions accompanying
      the SII and forward results to their MAJCOM/IG.
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                              33


  2.17.7. Rating. Normally, SIIs will not be rated/graded; the SII is for gathering data for
  analysis and action as necessary. If a rating is required as part of the SII, the scale will be
  specified in the SII instructions.
  2.17.8. MAJCOM Command Interest Items (CII). MAJCOM Commanders may wish to
  establish MAJCOM-unique procedures to gather data and/or place emphasis on a particular
  program via a Command Interest Item (CII). Ensure that MAJCOM CIIs do not conflict with
  Air Force SIIs.
     2.17.8.1. (Added-AFMC) Purpose. The CII program provides command-level
     visibility into the extent, impact, and status of specific known or suspected problems. It is
     also a means to gather data to evaluate the status of specific programs and conditions in
     the field requiring MAJCOM attention. Based on the added workload to the field caused
     by CIIs, HQ AFMC/IG will attempt to limit active CIIs to no more than four.
     2.17.8.2. (Added-AFMC) CII Duration. All AFMC CIIs will have duration of not
     more than one year. Based on the CII data collected during that year, the AFMC
     functional POC can request extensions of the CII in not more than one year increments.
     AFMC functional POC will coordinate CII extensions with applicable HQ AFMC
     directorates and gain approval from AFMC/CC.
     2.17.8.3. (Added-AFMC) CII Reporting. Most AFMC CIIs will be a one-time
     reporting requirement. The one-time reporting requirement can be satisfied with a Center
     self-inspection for the specific CII or an HQ AFMC/IG inspection. HQ AFMC/IG may
     inspect the CII, even though the Center has already conducted and reported a unit self-
     assessment. If a Center is not inspected by the HQ AFMC/IG during the CII active
     period, then the Center must conduct a self-inspection of the CII and submit results to the
     HQ AFMC/IG SII/CII monitor at hq.afmc.ig.sii@wpafb.af.mil NLT the end of the CII
     active period. Centers are responsible for tracking self-identified and HQ AFMC/IG-
     identified CII deficiencies.
     2.17.8.4. (Added-AFMC) CII    Creation,     Coordination,   Approval   and
     Imple mentation Process. HQ AFMC directorates recommend CIIs to AFMC/CC for
     approval.
         2.17.8.4.1. (Added-AFMC) Creation. The AFMC FAM, in coordination with HQ
         AFMC/IG, prepares a proposed CII using the AFMC CII format. The AFMC SII/CII
         monitor will review the proposed CII for standardization, question clarity, and
         reference validity prior to HQ AFMC staff coordination.
         2.17.8.4.2. (Added-AFMC) Coordination and Approval. Once HQ AFMC/IG
         reviews/approves the proposed CII, the AFMC functional POC will then coordinate
         the CII with all applicable HQ AFMC directorates and gain AFMC/CC approval.
         2.17.8.4.3. (Added-AFMC) Imple mentation. Once the CII is approved by
         AFMC/CC, HQ AFMC/IG will send the CII, a tasking letter, and any additional
         guidance to the appropriate Centers.
     2.17.8.5. (Added-AFMC) CII Quarterly Data Collection and Final Report
     Generation Process.
 34                                                  AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


            2.17.8.5.1. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC/IG Responsibilities. HQ AFMC/IG will
            consolidate CII data into a quarterly report and forward to the AFMC FAM NLT 30
            days after the quarter.
            2.17.8.5.2. (Added-AFMC) AFMC Functional Responsibilities. HQ AFMC FAM
            will analyze the HQ AFMC/IG submitted CII quarterly reports, then prepare, staff
            and submit a final report to AFMC/CC NLT 60 days after CII active period ends. The
            final CII report should include AFMC FAM analysis of CII gathered data and what
            actions the HQ AFMC FAM has done (or plans to do) in response to the CII data
            (e.g., policy change, SAV, new inspection checklist, etc.).
2.18. Inspection Technical Tools.
      2.18.1. Inspector General Evaluation Management System (IGEMS).
         2.18.1.1. IGEMS is the official Program of Record for the Air Force Inspection System.
         IGs will enter the following data in IGEMS at a minimum:
            2.18.1.1.1. The unit’s overall rating within 5 duty days of final report submission (for
            ANG units, within 1 UTA after final report submission). (T-1)
            2.18.1.1.2. Post the final inspection report in IGEMS w/in 5 duty days of final report
            submission (for ANG units, within 1 UTA after final report submission). (T-1)
            2.18.1.1.3. All IG-identified deficiencies will be entered into IGEMS. (T-1) IGs may
            enter deficiencies found by non-IG inspectors into IGEMS only after assessing and
            validating the deficiencies IAW AFI 90-201. IG Augmentees from Functional Areas
            may also enter data in functional data systems in addition to, not in lieu of, IGEMS.
                2.18.1.1.3.1. All HAF-level deficiencies will be tracked to closure within
                IGEMS. (T-1)
            2.18.1.1.4. Corrective action plans, Deficiency Cause Code (see Attachment 7,
            Deficiency Cause Codes and Explanations), and dates when deficiencies are opened
            and when they are closed within 5 duty days of corrective action plan implementation
            (for ANG units, within 1 UTA after corrective plan implementation). See paragraph
            2.20.9. for deficiency tracking guidance. (T-1)
            2.18.1.1.5. Enter top five most common issues identified by Airmen during ATIS-Gs
            for SECAF consideration, categorized by UEI sub-MGA in IGEMS.
            2.18.1.1.6. Enter all deficiencies of By-Law programs (see attachment 3), their
            respective corrective action plans, and the Deficiency Cause Code (see Attachment 7,
            Deficiency Cause Codes and Explanations) within 5 duty days of corrective action
            plan implementation.
         2.18.1.2. For classified inspection reporting, use existing reporting methods on the Secret
         Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet). IG teams will fully utilize IGEMS-C for
         classified inspection reporting, including Nuclear Weapons Technical Inspection (NWTI)
         reports IAW CJCSI 3263.05. (T-1)
            2.18.1.2.1. MAJCOM IGs will ensure corrective action data is included for all
            deficiencies loaded into IGEMS-C. For all CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT
            deficiencies, minimum corrective action data includes MAJCOM-closed root
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                         35


        cause(s), Deficiency Cause Code(s) assigned from Attachment 7, countermeasures, to
        include OPRs and ECDs, and deficiency closure dates. For MINOR deficienci es,
        minimum data includes the Deficiency Cause Code(s). For open deficiencies, the
        corrective action OPR will report status in IGEMS-C quarterly, or as required by
        MAJCOM IGs.
     2.18.1.3. Access management. Access to IGEMS will be administered by AFIA,
     SAF/IGI and IG Administrators. (T-1)
        2.18.1.3.1. (Added-AFMC) IGEMS/IGEMS-C Access.                   HQ AFMC/IG
        Administrators are responsible for granting permission/access to Wing and Center
        Administrators. Wing and Center Administrators will be responsible for granti ng
        access to their respective unit personnel.
        2.18.1.3.2. (Added-AFMC) IGEMS/IGEMS-C Access for Wing and Center
        Administrators. Wing and Center Administrators must complete a DD Form 2875,
        System Authorization Access Request, in order to be granted access to IGEMS.
        Forms must be completed in their entirety and should be sent to the IGEMS
        helpdesk for processing. Once the submitted DD 2875 has been processed by the
        IGEMS helpdesk, the Wing and Center Administrators will receive an email notifying
        them they are able to proceed with registering for an IGEMS account. Wing and
        Center Administrators should select the following roles when registering for the
        IGEMS account: Non-MAJCOM IG User, Basic User, Planner, Scheduler, Inspector,
        and Administrator, as applicable. After the Wing and Center Administrators has
        registered for an IGEMS account, the HQ AFMC/IG Administrator is responsible for
        approving or denying the request. Wing and Center Administrators will notify the
        HQ AFMC/IG Administrators of any personnel changes to ensure access to IGEMS
        stays current.
        2.18.1.3.3. (Added-AFMC) IGEMS/IGEMS-C Access for Unit Personnel. Wing
        and Center IGEMS Administrators are responsible for granting permission/access to
        unit personnel.      Unit personnel must complete a DD Form 2875, System
        Authorization Access Request, in order to be granted access to IGEMS. Forms must
        be completed in their entirety and should be sent to the IGEMS helpdesk for
        processing. Once the submitted DD 2875 has been processed by the IGEMS
        helpdesk, the requestor will receive an email notifying them they are able to proceed
        with registering for an IGEMS account. The requestor should select the following
        roles when registering for the IGEMS account: Non-MAJCOM IG User and Basic
        User. Wing and Center IGEMS Administrator can change permissions if a higher
        level is required. After the user has registered for an IGEMS account, the Wing or
        Center IGEMS Administrator is responsible for approving or denying the request.
        The user will notify the Wing or Center IGEMS Administrator of personnel changes
        to ensure access to IGEMS stays current.
     2.18.1.4. (Added-AFMC) IGEMS/IGEMS-C Training. Training can be obtained two
     ways. First, members can request access to the IGEMS Test and Training site to get
     familiarization with creating inspections and or deficiencies. This site mirrors the

        Test and Training site, members can also access the Help CBT for additional step by step
        training. If additional training is required, contact the HQ AFMC/IG Administrator.
        2.18.1.5. (Added-AFMC) IGEMS Support. Unit personnel (i.e., Non-MAJCOM IG
        Users) experiencing problems within IGEMS should first contact their Wing or Center
        IGEMS Administrator for resolution. If the Wing or Center IGEMS Administrator is
        unable to resolve the issue, it should be elevated to the HQ AFMC/IG IGEMS
        Administrator and IGEMS Helpdesk, in turn.
        2.18.1.6. (Added-AFMC) IGEMS Require ments. All requirements for IGEMS will
        be submitted to the Center IGEMS Administrator, who will in turn forward to the HQ
        AFMC/IG IGEMS Administrator for presentation to the IGEMS Requirements Board.
     2.18.2. Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT).
        2.18.2.1. MICT is an AF program of record used by Airmen to accomplish self-
        assessment of program management and compliance with higher headquarters directives.
        MICT provides the supervisor and command chain, from Sq/CC to SECAF, tiered
        visibility into user-selected compliance reports and program status. MICT also allows
        FAMs the ability to monitor unit performance/status. Additionally, MICT can assist IGs
        with formulating specific inspection methodology and IG team composition for the CCIP
        and on-site UEI. MICT can also help facilitate the Special Interest Item (SII) program by
        gathering time-sensitive data in an expeditious manner.
        2.18.2.2. Medical Quality Assurance data can now be entered into MICT; this data is
        sensitive information and must be treated IAW Privacy Act of 1974 and Title 10 USC
        1102, Medical Quality Assurance Records. Personal Identifiable Information (PII),
        HIPAA, DoD UCNI and classified information will not be entered into MICT.
        2.18.2.3. (Added-AFMC) MICT Business Rules.
           2.18.2.3.1. (Added-AFMC) MICT Access. Unit Administrators are responsible for
           granting permission to unit members. (T-2) This is accomplished by a member
           going to the Assistance Tab within MICT and requesting unit permissions. Once a
           member has requested unit permissions, an email will be sent to the unit administrator
           stating that the member has requested unit permissions. The unit administrator is
           responsible for approving or denying the request. Unit permissions are set to default
           to Assessor permission. The unit administrator can change a member’s permissions if
           a higher level is required.
           2.18.2.3.2. (Added-AFMC) MICT Training.                   The HQ AFMC MICT
           Administrator is responsible for training each Wing and Center MICT Administrator,
           who in turn is responsible for training their unit administrators. Training Modules are
           located in the Help Guides under the Assistance Tab.
           2.18.2.3.3. (Added-AFMC) MICT Support. Unit members experiencing problems
           within MICT should first contact their unit administrator for resolution. If the unit
           administrator is unable to resolve the issue, it should be elevated, in turn, to the next
           higher MICT management level.
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                               37


           2.18.2.3.4. (Added-AFMC) MICT Require ments. All requirements for MICT
           will be submitted to the Center MICT Administrator, who will in turn forward to the
           HQ AFMC MICT Administrator for presentation to the MICT Requirements Board.
2.19. Inspection Reports.
   2.19.1. Classification. Review all reports prior to publication to ensure they are properly
   classified and marked IAW DOD 5200.1-R, Procedures Governing the Activities of DOD
   Intelligence Components that Affect United States Persons and AFI 31-401.
   2.19.2. Report Marking. At a minimum, mark unclassified inspection reports "For Official
   Use Only (FOUO)" IAW DOM 5200.1V2 and AFI 31-401. For nuclear inspection reporting
   requirements, see Chapter 6.
   2.19.3. Releasability. TIG is the confidential agent of SECAF and CSAF for obtaining
   uninhibited self-analysis and self-criticism of the internal management, operation, and
   administration of the Air Force. Therefore, Air Force IG reports are internal memoranda and
   constitute privileged information that is not releasable outside the AF except with specific
   approval of TIG. All requests for IG reports, or extracts therefrom, originating from sources
   outside the original distribution, shall be referred to SAF/IGI for coordination and clearance.
   Classifications and restrictions on the disclosure or use of IG reports shall be strictly
   observed.
(Note: Medical inspection data may be additionally protected from disclosure under 10 U.S.C.
1102 and should not be released without review by appropriate medical risk management
personnel).

       2.19.3.1. Release Determination Authority. Before releasing inspection reports other
       than NSI reports (all types) outside DOD, FOIA offices will receive a final release
       determination from SAF/IGI. Non-DOD parties requesting inspection reports should be
       referred to the appropriate FOIA office. Release of NSI Reports is IAW CJCSI 3263.05.
       2.19.3.2. Release within DOD. DOD members, DOD contractors, consultants, and
       grantees are permitted access to inspection reports IAW DOD Regulation 5400.7-
       R/AFMAN 33-302. MAJCOM/IGs are authorized to release their own inspection
       reports, in whole or in part, within DOD. Courtesy copy SAF/IGI on any inspection
       report released outside the Air Force.
       2.19.3.3. Release of Inspection Summary to News Media. An inspection summary may
       be released for internal information or in response to news media queries in coordination
       with public affairs. The summary will be limited to the overall rating, inspection
       process/definition and, if desired, personal comments by the commander (e.g. general
       laudatory comments, perception of inspection process). The published summary will not
       contain detailed information (e.g. sub-area ratings, a list of individuals recognized by the
       IG, specific deficiencies, or specific ratings for inspection criteria). The use of HAF and
       MAJCOM Public Affairs Guidance are encouraged.
       2.19.3.4. Releasability Statement. The following statement must appear on the cover and
       each page of the report as well as in any transmission, presentation, or document
       containing protected IG material: “For Official Use Only. This report may be protected
       from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Do not release or publish, in
 38                                                   AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


         whole or in part, outside official DOD channels without express approval of the Director,
         SAF/IGI.” Include similar statements on reports of inspections conducted jointly with
         inspection teams from other DOD agencies.
      2.19.4. Executive Summary. NLT 5 work days after the IG team outbriefs the inspected unit,
      the MAJCOM/IG will send an executive summary of the inspection, IAW Figure A6.2 to the
      inspected unit CC and SAF/IGI, unless the final inspection report has already been published
      and distributed. MAJCOM/IGs will submit the completed UEI scoresheet to SAF/IGI prior
      to posting the final report in IGEMS.
      2.19.5. Final Inspection Report. NLT 30 days after the IG team departs the inspected unit,
      the MAJCOM/IG will send the final IG inspection report and notify organizations the final
      IG inspection report is available in IGEMS.
      2.19.6. Inspections will be rated according to inspection type.
      2.19.7. (Added-AFMC) Outstanding Performers/Teams for UEIs.
         2.19.7.1. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC/IG team members occasionally observe
         individuals or teams whose contributions to the unit's mission accomplishment clearly
         exceed their peers. The IG Team Chief will recognize individuals or teams as
         Outstanding Performers/Teams.
         2.19.7.2. (Added-AFMC) The HQ AFMC/IG will validate                      each candidate’s
         qualifications with the supervisor, first sergeant, or unit commander.
         2.19.7.3. (Added-AFMC) Individual nominations are limited to personnel in grades E-
         7, O-4, WG-10 or GS-13 and below who meet all appropriate quality force standards.
         Individual contractor personnel shall not be recognized as outstanding performers.
         2.19.7.4. (Added-AFMC) Team nominations can be comprised of military, civilians,
         and support contractors. No grade restrictions apply to teams; however, they cannot be
         comprised solely of contractors. When recognizing contractors, the HQ AFMC/IG must
         identify the company they represent in the report.
2.20. Inspection Deficiencies.
      2.20.1. All inspection reports will address non-primary inspection activity deficiencies,
      including safety, surety, or issues of military discipline. These concerns may directly affect
      an overall inspection rating at the discretion of the inspection team chief and will be
      documented in the final inspection report. Inspection reports will include only findings
      categorized as Strengths, Deficiencies or Recommended Improvement Areas (RIA). RIAs
      will not be used to document procedural deviations or non-compliance; they are only used to
      identify areas where a more efficient or effective course of action is available.
      2.20.2. Self-identified deficiencies. One of the primary objectives of the new AFIS is to
      foster a culture of critical self-assessment and continuous improvement, and to reduce
      reliance on external inspection teams. To accomplish that, trust must be built between
      commanders, Airmen and the IG, beginning with the shared goal of improving the unit’s
      effectiveness. A key component to building trust in this stage of the AFIS is creating an
      environment where Airmen feel they can safely report what’s true, not what they believe
      their commander or the IG expects them to report. Airmen must understand their command
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                          39


  chain and their commanders' IG teams highly value honest and accurate reporting. To that
  end, the following apply:
     2.20.2.1. Wing IGs. The responsibility for detecting non-compliance rests with the Wing
     CC, subordinate commanders and supervisors. Wing IGs should document non-
     compliance in CCIP inspection reports and in IGEMS. Ratings should be positively
     influenced if the unit accurately identifies and reports the issue through the Self-
     Assessment Program—even more so if it is apparent the unit does this on a regular basis
     as part of their daily battle rhythm.
     2.20.2.2. MAJCOM IGs. A UEI is a years-long, continual inspection of the unit’s
     effectiveness, and is intended to help the Wing CC understand the areas of greatest risk
     from undetected non-compliance. MAJCOM IGs will document areas of significant or
     systemic undetected non-compliance. Scoring of Wing CCIP will be positively
     influenced if the unit CCIP accurately detects and reports in a systematic way to enable
     the command chain to do root-cause analysis and apply corrective actions.
  2.20.3. Safety and Health. Safety and Health are integral parts of every inspection.
  Inspectors will assess safety and health procedures and workplace hazards during all
  inspections, notify the appropriate commander and Safety office of concerns, and document
  in the report, if required.
  2.20.4. Surety. Nuclear surety, at nuclear capable units, is always subject to inspection
  during any IG inspection. A potential nuclear surety deficiency will be brought to the
  immediate attention of the inspection team chief. The team chief will determine the
  appropriate course of action and determine the impact (if any) on the inspection rating.
  2.20.5. Validation. MAJCOM and Wing IGs will establish a validation process that provides
  the inspected unit the opportunity to clarify and/or rebut in a timely manner any potential
  deficiencies identified during the inspection. The IG Team Chief, in coordination with the
  unit under inspection, will coordinate with the appropriate FAMs on critical and significant
  deficiencies identified during the inspection. This process applies to deficiencies levied
  against other Wings, MAJCOM units or HHQ organizations. (T-1)
     2.20.5.1. When the IG determines the need for external validation of a potential
     deficiency, inspectors will validate with the appropriate subject matter experts (SME) at
     the lowest possible level, but no higher than the appropriate FAM at the IG’s
     organizational level: Wing IGs validate with Wing FAMs if available; MAJCOM IGs
     validate with MAJCOM/NGB/FOA/DRU or organizations with whom the IG team has a
     memorandum of agreement. MAJCOM/NGB/FOA/DRU FAMs will consult with the
     appropriate HAF Functional as required to ensure proper interpretation of Air Force (or
     higher) policy. (T-1)
         2.20.5.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Validation with HQ AFMC Functional Area
         Manager (FAM) for Unit Effectiveness Deficiencies (UEI) Deficiencies.
             2.20.5.1.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Purpose. Validation of potential deficiencies
             serves as a crosscheck to ensure inspection report accuracy. HQ AFMC/IG
             validates with the AFMC FAM and/or cognizant subject matter expert (SME) to
             verify the inspector’s policy interpretation. The HQ AFMC/IG inspection Team
             Chief makes final determination on potential deficiencies (to include severity
40                                            AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


        level). Once a Critical or Significant deficiency is validated with the AFMC FAM
        and validated with the unit, the deficiency is final and will be included in the final
        report.
        2.20.5.1.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Each HQ AFMC Directorate may have its own
        procedures established for validation of HQ AFMC/IG inspection deficiencies.
        HQ AFMC/IG inspectors should use the HQ AFMC Directorate’s established
        process for validation. If HQ AFMC Directorate-specific validation procedures
        do not exist for a functional area, then HQ AFMC/IG inspectors will crosscheck
        all potential Significant and Critical deficiencies with HQ AFMC SMEs within
        the HQ AFMC Directorate.
        2.20.5.1.1.3. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC/IG Functional Leads must ensure HQ
        AFMC FAMs are suitably aware of inspection dates and may be contacted
        throughout the entire inspection for validation.
        2.20.5.1.1.4. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC/IG inspectors will document the name
        and organization/office symbol of the functional point of contact (POC) who
        validates the deficiency and the date/time in the deficiency’s non-reportable
        comments field within IGEMS.
     2.20.5.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Validation with Inspected Unit during Capstone
     UEI Visits.
        2.20.5.1.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Purpose. Validation of potential deficiencies
        serves as a crosscheck to ensure inspection report accuracy. HQ AFMC/IG
        validates with the inspected unit to obtain additional facts that may help better
        word, categorize, or mitigate the deficiency.
        2.20.5.1.2.2. (Added-AFMC) Procedure. The unit validation process relies on
        constant communication between the HQ AFMC/IG and the unit throughout the
        course of the inspection. This includes potential deficiencies transmission, unit
        responses, and daily leadership feedback.
        2.20.5.1.2.3. (Added-AFMC) IG Daily Activity Summary. The HQ AFMC/IG
        Team Chief will electronically transmit the “IG Daily Activity Summary,” which
        may include potential deficiencies, mitigation results, performance
        evaluation/quality verification inspection results, and any other pertinent
        information. Deficiencies do not have to be validated by HQ AFMC FAMs prior
        to transmission. The inspected unit will identify unit-level recipient(s) of this
        transmission no later than the first day of the inspection.
        2.20.5.1.2.4. (Added-AFMC) Unit Responses. The inspected unit is permitted
        to respond or provide additional information on any potential deficiency received
        in the “IG Daily Activity Summary.” The HQ AFMC/IG will use this information
        to determine if further investigation is warranted, if the deficiency should be
        edited (e.g., reduced in severity, reworded, or eliminated), or the deficiency
        should stand as originally written. If the unit decides to provide responses, they
        will do so through a single POC via the IG-provided EIM site in accordance with
        HQ AFMC/IG Team Chief provided timelines. The HQ AFMC/IG Team Chief
        will approve exceptions to the consolidated responses on a case by case basis.
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                              41


             2.20.5.1.2.5. (Added-AFMC) Daily Leadership Feedback. The HQ AFMC/IG
             Team Chief will provide daily face-to-face feedback to the inspected unit’s senior
             leadership.
             2.20.5.1.2.6. (Added-AFMC) Final Disposition of Deficiencies. The HQ
             AFMC/IG Team Chief makes final determination on potential deficiencies
             disputed by the inspected unit. Once a Significant or Critical deficiency is
             validated with the unit and validated with the appropriate HQ AFMC FAMs, the
             HQ AFMC/IG considers the deficiency final, and will include the deficiency in
             the final inspection report.
     2.20.5.2. FAMs or other SMEs will clarify policy and procedures, or validate that a
     potential deficiency does/does not comply with policy, and will not provide
     input/comment on the severity of a validated deficiency; that responsibility resides with
     the IG.
     2.20.5.3. Oversight Deficiencies. IGs are not required to validate deficiencies beyond
     the appropriate FAMs or agencies with which the IG has MOA/Memorandum of
     Understanding for validation support. If an external oversight team independently
     validates with the HAF Functional and receives contradictory information, a deficiency
     may be levied against the MAJCOM and/or HAF Functional.
     2.20.5.4. All validated deficiencies will be documented in the IG’s report and entered in
     IGEMS. (T-1)
  2.20.6. Deficiency Cause Codes. Corrective action OPRs will assign Deficiency Cause
  Codes to all deficiencies in IGEMS IAW Attachment 7. (T-1)
  2.20.7. Deficiencies External to the Inspected Unit. When an IG team is considering
  assigning a deficiency to an organization outside their organization (wing or MAJCOM), the
  inspecting IG team chief will notify the owning IG of the potential deficiency and validation
  details (or AFIA for DRU/FOAs, HAF or non-AF deficiencies) and courtesy copy both the
  tenant and host base units soonest, preferably during the inspection but NLT 5 duty days after
  completion of the inspection. If possible, validate each deficiency with the potential
  Corrective Action OPR and gain concurrence that the OPR will accept the deficiency;
  however, Corrective Action OPR concurrence with deficiency assignment or wording is not
  required. Once validated, the owning IG (or AFIA) will be responsible for tracking status
  and notifying the inspecting IG when closed (See paragraph 6.13 for reporting, tracking,
  and closure reporting of DTRA-identified NSI deficiencies). In instances where the
  inspection involves associate units, coordination between the associated and associating
  units’ IGs on how deficiencies are assigned, assessed, and resolved will be essential to
  ensuring timely resolution.
  2.20.8. Deficiency write-ups will:
     2.20.8.1. Be assigned a unique tracking number.
     2.20.8.2. Describe, in sufficient detail, the deficiency and contextual facts as necessary to
     clearly convey the defect requiring resolution. The written description alone should be
     adequate for the inspected party to begin corrective action planning.
42                                                  AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


            2.20.8.2.1. (Added-AFMC) For both HQ AFMC/IG-identified deficiencies and
            WIT-identified deficiencies, include the applicable program name from the AFMC
            Program Portfolio on the first line of the deficiency write-up in parenthesis.
            Associating deficiencies with a program name will facilitate continued
            analysis/trending by functional area. The AFMC Program Portfolio is located
            https://org.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/HQAFMCIG/In-
            Garrison/IG%20Docume nts/Schedule/Gatekeeper%20Schedule/(Use%20This%

            592%20(Updated%2011%20Apr_13)_fe.accdb
        2.20.8.3. Be assigned a deficiency severity of CRITICAL, SIGNIFICANT, or MINOR.
        2.20.8.4. Reference the applicable instruction, technical order or other source
        documentation.
        2.20.8.5. Address impact of continued deviation or non-compliance for critical
        deficiencies.
            2.20.8.5.1. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC/IG will include impact statements with
            Significant and Critical deficiencies.
        2.20.8.6. Identify FAM OPRs at the IG’s organizational level for CRITICAL and
        SIGNIFICANT deficiencies (MAJCOM functional office responsible for coordinating on
        unit’s corrective action plan).
            2.20.8.6.1. (Added-AFMC) For all HQ AFMC/IG-identified Significant and
            Critical deficiencies, the relevant Center IG will be the OPR (i.e., Organizational
            POC within IGEMS) and the FAM OPR will be the HQ AFMC FAM (i.e., FAM
            POC within IGEMS).
            2.20.8.6.2. (Added-AFMC) For all HQ AFMC/IG-identified Minor deficiencies, the
            relevant Group Commander will be the OPR.
        2.20.8.7. Identify the additional Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR), if applicable.
            2.20.8.7.1. (Added-AFMC) For all HQ AFMC/IG-identified Significant and
            Critical deficiencies, the HQ AFMC/IG functional lead will be the OCR.
            2.20.8.7.2. (Added-AFMC) For all HQ AFMC/IG-identified Minor deficiencies, the
            relevant Wing Commander will be the OCR.
        2.20.8.8. Deficiencies that involve hosts/tenants outside the inspected unit’s chain-of-
        command, HHQ, other MAJCOMs, DRU/FOA, HAF or non-AF entities will be
        categorized as HHQ/Support Agency Deficiencies.
     2.20.9. Deficiency Corrective Actions.
        2.20.9.1. At a minimum, MAJCOM IGs will track to closure CRITICAL and
        SIGNIFICANT deficiencies documented in a MAJCOM IG report and provide the
        inspected unit with reply instructions as part of the final report. (T-1) The inspected unit
        will provide associated corrective action plans to MAJCOM IGs NLT 45 days and for
        ARC units NLT 90 days after the final inspection report is published. (T-1) For open
        deficiencies, the corrective action OPR will report status to MAJCOM IG quarterly, or as
        required by MAJCOM/IG, in IGEMS or IGEMS-C. (T-2) FAMs will coordinate and
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                          43


     approve corrective action plans for all CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT deficiencies. (T-2)
     After review and coordination with the responsible FAMs, the corrective action plan is in
     place, and required data is entered in IGEMS/IGEMS-C, MAJCOM IGs may close the
     deficiency. Minor deficiencies assessed to the inspected unit will be closed at or below
     the wing level. (T-1) Deficiencies assessed to the MAJCOM-level will be closed by the
     MAJCOM/IG. (T-1)
        2.20.9.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Once an inspection report is finalized, the HQ
        AFMC/IG IGEMS Administrator will assign three POCs to each Critical or
        Significant deficiency: the Organization POC, the IG POC (a member of HQ
        AFMC/IG core staff), and the FAM POC (the appropriate HQ AFMC FAM). To
        begin the deficiency closure process, the HQ AFMC/IG IGEMS Administrator
        assigns the deficiency to the Organization POC. The inspected unit (via the
        Organization POC) has 45 calendar days from the date of the final report to complete
        the Problem Breakdown, Root Cause, Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Methodology, and
        Corrective Action Plan (CAP)/Countermeasures sections in IGEMS. (T-2) The
        RCA, Deficiency Cause Code, CAP included in these sections must be approved by
        the Center IG prior to inclusion in IGEMS. To submit these sections for review by
        the IG POC, the Organization POC completes the sections and marks the deficiency
        as “Proposed.”
        2.20.9.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Once the deficiency is in “Proposed” status, the IG
        POC (a member of HQ AFMC/IG core staff) has 14 calendar days to review the
        RCA/CAP submission in IGEMS. If the IG POC determines the RCA/CAP is
        sufficient for FAM POC review, the IG POC marks the deficiency as “Accepted” and
        the deficiency flows to the FAM POC (the appropriate HQ AFMC FAM). If the IG
        POC determines the RCA/CAP is insufficient for FAM POC review, the IG POC
        marks the deficiency as “Opened” and indicates the new suspense date for an updated
        RCA/CAP. The deficiency then returns to the Organization POC for revision and
        resubmission.
        2.20.9.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Once the RCA/CAP has been submi tted to the FAM
        POC, the FAM POC has 14 calendar days to review the RCA/CAP and recommend
        closing the deficiency or keeping the deficiency open in IGEMS. The FAM POC
        then marks the deficiency as “Implemented” and the deficiency flows back to the IG
        POC. Based on the FAM POC’s recommendation, the IG POC either marks the
        deficiency as “Opened” or “Closed.” If the deficiency remains “Opened,” the process
        will continue until an appropriate RCA/CAP is approved by the FAM POC and the
        IG POC. The final closure authority is the IG POC.
        2.20.9.1.4. (Added-AFMC) FAMs and HQ AFMC/IG will evaluate corrective
        action plans for sufficiency and effectiveness. CAPs will describe:
            2.20.9.1.4.1. (Added-AFMC) How the unit immediately mitigated mission
            impact (i.e. actions already taken) and the plan for sustained mitigation until
            lasting solution is in place.
            2.20.9.1.4.2. (Added-AFMC) Root Cause Analysis tools used with a focus on
            fact-based analysis (e.g. Five-Whys, Brainstorming, etc). General statements (e.g.
            lack of manning, improper training, etc.) without supporting facts and

            documentation will be deemed insufficient. Include Deficiency Cause Codes and
            Explanation assigned from Attachment 7.
            2.20.9.1.4.3. (Added-AFMC) Sense of urgency reflected in an aggressive
            timeline, realistic completion dates, and remaining actions.
            2.20.9.1.4.4. (Added-AFMC) Level of leadership involvement (e.g., unit
            through Center Commander, HHQ involvement, etc.) and collaboration with
            functional experts.
            2.20.9.1.4.5. (Added-AFMC) Preventative measures in place and scheduled to
            be in place.
            2.20.9.1.4.6. (Added-AFMC) “Who” does “What” by “When.”
            2.20.9.1.4.7. (Added-AFMC) Limiting factors, if any.
        2.20.9.1.5. (Added-AFMC) Critical deficiencies open longer than six months and
        Significant deficiencies open longer than nine months at the end of the quarter during
        which the final report is signed will be briefed as part of the MAJCOM HQ battle
        rhythm (paragraph 2.10.1). HQ AFMC/IG will send read-ahead briefing slides to the
        Center commander-designated inspection POCs and HQ AFMC functional staff prior
        to each AFMC Group and Council for coordination.
     2.20.9.2. Wing IGs will track to closure all deficiencies documented in a Wing IG report
     and provide the inspected unit with reply instructions as part of the final report. (T-1) The
     inspected unit will provide associated corrective action plans to Wing IGs NLT 45 days
     and for ARC units NLT 90 days after the final inspection report is published. (T-3) Wing
     CCs will determine deficiency closure authority for Wing IG-identified deficiencies. (T-
     1) Deficiencies assessed to the MAJCOM will be closed by the MAJCOM/IG. (T-2)
     2.20.9.3. All deficiencies not requiring a long-term solution (as determined by the IG)
     should be closed within 12 months (18 months for ARC).
     2.20.9.4. In instances where corrective action responsibility is assigned to both the host
     and tenant unit (or supported and supporting unit), IGs will assign an OPR and an OCR
     to correct the identified deficiencies.
     2.20.9.5. Deficiencies that contain potential Fraud, Waste or Abuse will be highlighted in
     inspection reports and forwarded to the MAJCOM/IG for semi-annual reporting. (T-1)
     2.20.9.6. MAJCOM and Wing IGs will utilize IGEMS to assign all HAF-level
     (FOA/DRU, HAF, and non-AF) actionable deficiencies to AFIA for deficiency
     processing. IGs will also assign the wing SMEs and MAJCOM, FOA/DRU, HAF, and
     non-AF Functional(s) who participated in the deficiency validation. If the SMEs and/or
     FAMs do not have IGEMS access, include their contact info in the IGEMS deficiency
     notes tab. AFIA will forward the deficiency and problem solving/corrective action
     requirements to the responsible HAF-level office (O-6/GS equivalent or above) for action
     or comment and copy the MAJCOM/IG. If the HAF-level office does not concur with the
     deficiency, rationale for non-concurrence will be uploaded in IGEMS or provided to
     AFIA and/or the MAJCOM IG. For actionable deficiencies, corrective action OPRs will
     upload the corrective action in IGEMS or forward it electronically to AFIA and the
     MAJCOM IG in enough detail to evaluate whether to close the deficiency or keep it
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                               45


       open. If corrective action is not complete, AFIA will follow up with the corrective action
       OPRs for status updates. When appropriate, AFIA will close the deficiency in IGEMS in
       coordination with the MAJCOM IG.
   2.20.10. Root Cause Analysis. Problem-solving responsibility and the corrective action
   process reside at the lowest appropriate command level. Commanders will ensure RCA is
   completed for all deficiencies using the problem-solving approach/tool and level of effort
   best suited to the situation. Commanders should strongly consider using the rigor of the AF
   8-Step Problem Solving Model as outlined in the AFSO21 playbook for CRITICAL and
   SIGNIFICANT deficiencies to determine primary and, if applicable, contributing root
   causes.
   2.20.11. Deficiency Fix Rate (DFR). MAJCOM/IGs, Wing IGs and AFIA will monitor DFR
   for all identified CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT deficiencies. DFR is a key measure of
   performance to show the average number of days required to close a deficiency. The DFR
   clock starts on the date of the inspection outbrief. The DFR clock stops when the deficiency
   is closed. For a long-term deficiency (one in which the fix runs through the Future Years
   Defense Plan), once the proper mitigation is in place to effectively manage the deficiency
   risk, deficiency closure may be appropriate.
   2.20.12. The Deficiency Cause Codes listed in Attachme nt 7 apply to all inspections listed
   in this AFI except Defense Nuclear Surety Inspections (DNSI), which have unique codes
   assigned by DOD (see Chapter 6 for nuclear-specific inspection guidance). Assign all
   Deficiency Cause Codes required to describe the deficiency. Commonly, more than one
   Deficiency Cause Code will be applicable. NOTE: If the code “OT” (Other) is used, a full
   description must be included.
   2.20.13. Write-ups from previous inspections should be reviewed prior to an inspection. At
   the conclusion of the inspection, repeat deficiencies should be considered in the unit’s overall
   rating. Identify the repeat deficiency by stating: “REPEAT DEFICIENCY,” followed by the
   updated deficiency write-up. Repeat deficiencies are deficiencies that have been previously
   identified, corrected, and closed, and have recurred following closure.
2.21. Inspection Outbrief. The IG, in coordination with the unit CC, will determine the timing,
location, scope and format of the inspection outbrief, ranging from one-on-one meetings with the
unit CC to a mass outbrief with a broad cross-section of the unit. (T-2) Unit CCs will provide a
suitable location within resource capability. (T-3)
   2.21.1. Unit outbriefs are considered a version of the inspection report and consequently fall
   within releasability restrictions. DOD members, contractors, consultants, and grantees are
   permitted to attend inspection outbriefs at the discretion of the unit commander. Community
   leaders and the general public are not authorized access to inspection results, to include
   outbriefs, except as permitted by DOD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302 (see paragraph 2.17.3)
2.22. The Air Force Inspection System Governance Process.
   2.22.1. The governance process is executed by three groups shown in Figure 2.3. Charters
   for each of the groups will contain detailed duties and functions.

         2.22.1.1. Inspection System Working Group (ISWG). The ISWG meets quarterly to
         discuss the adequacy of the AFIS and proposals for improving the AFIS. The ISWG is
         chaired by SAF/IGI with membership from key HAF 2-letter O-6/Civilian Equivalent
         representatives (AF/A1, AF/A2, AF/A3/5, AF/A4/7, SAF/CIO A6, AF/A8, AF/A9,
         AF/A10, AF/SG, AF/JA, SAF/AA, SAF/IE, AF/SE, NGB-IG, SAF/FM) and
         MAJCOM/IGs. The ISWG will vet proposals and track action items for consideration by
         the Inspector General Advisory Board (IGAB) and/or the Inspection System Council
         (ISC).
         2.22.1.2. Inspector General Advisory Board (IGAB). The IGAB meets semi-annually to
         discuss issues forwarded by the ISWG and any other inspection related business deemed
         appropriate for this forum. SAF/IG chairs the IGAB, comprised of key 2-letter
         Functionals, or their Deputies. SAF/IGI is the Executive Secretary for the IGAB.
         2.22.1.3. Inspection System Council (ISC). The ISC meets semi-annually in conjunction
         with existing MAJCOM/CV meetings to discuss any inspection related business and to
         approve/disapprove suggestions for improving the AFIS submitted by the ISWG or
         IGAB. SAF/IG chairs the ISC, comprised of MAJCOM/CVs and selected FOA/DRU
         CCs. SAF/IGI is the Executive Secretary for the ISC.
      2.22.2. Process to Change List of Authorized Inspections (Attachme nt 2) or Inspection
      Requirements (Attachme nt 3). AF agencies should submit requests to change, add or
      subtract an inspection activity listed in Attachme nt 2, or an inspection requirement listed in
      Attachment 3, to the appropriate HAF 2-letter for coordination. AF/JA will determine all
      JA Functional inspection requirements. HAF 2-letters may submit the recommendation to
      SAF/IGI at safigi.workflow@pentagon.af.mil for vetting through the AFIS Governance
      Process. The request should include a 1-page justification, OPR and phone number for
      further clarification.
         2.22.2.1. Non-AF agencies should contact SAF/IGI with a request to change/add/subtract
         an inspection activity in Attachme nt 2. SAF/IGI will gain TIG’s approval and notify
         IGAB and ISC members at the next meeting.

                                             Chapter 3

                           THE MANAGEMENT INSPECTION (MI)

3.1. Introduction. The MI is conducted above the Wing level (HAF/MAJCOM/NAF and select
FOA/DRUs) and will normally be accomplished by AFIA. The MI assesses the efficiency,
effectiveness, economy, and discipline of organizations, activities, or programs based on the
fundamental principles of well-managed organizations.
      3.1.1. MAJCOM/IGs may conduct an MI only if AFIA’s checklist, methodology and
      grading criteria are used and inspectors are MI-certified by AFIA.
3.2. Purpose. The purpose of the MI is to assess management functions above the Wing level
against the fundamental principles of well-managed organizations.
3.3. Execution. MIs are conducted to assess areas mandated by law as well as management
functions above the wing level against the fundamental principles of well -managed
organizations.
3.4. Rating. Overall management performance and management MGAs will be rated using the
following five-tier scale:
      3.4.1. OUTSTANDING - The rating given to indicate performance or operations that
      reliably exceed expectations and mission requirements. Procedures and activities are carried
      out in a highly effective and highly efficient manner. Commitment to continuous process
      improvement is evident. Programs and processes are measured, institutionalized, and of
      exceptional merit. Risk-based criteria are habitually applied when allocating resources and
      making decisions. Root-cause analysis is regularly used to find and fix problems. Programs
      are nearly deficiency-free.
      3.4.2. EXCELLENT – The rating given to indicate performance or operations exceed
      mission requirements. Procedures and activities are carried out in a superior manner.
      Resources and programs are very efficiently managed and relatively deficiency-free. Risk-
      based criteria are often applied when allocating resources and making decisions. Root-cause
      analysis is often used to find and fix problems.
      3.4.3. SATISFACTORY – The rating given to indicate performance or operations meet
      expectations and mission requirements. Procedures and activities are carried out in an
      effective and efficient manner. Programs and processes are measured and repeatable. Risk-
      based criteria are usually applied when allocating resources and making decisions. Root-
      cause analysis is usually used to find and fix problems. Deficiencies exist that do not impede
      or limit mission accomplishment.
      3.4.4. MARGINAL – The rating given to indicate performance or operation needs
      improvement. Procedures and activities are not carried out in a competent manner, or
      produce unreliable results. Resources and programs are not well managed. Risk and
      resource scarcity is rarely considered in decision-making processes. No effort at increasing
      efficiency or reliability is evident. Deficiencies exist that impede or limit mission
      accomplishment.
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                              49


   3.4.5. UNSATISFACTORY – The rating given to indicate performance or operations do not
   meet expectations or mission requirements. Procedures and activities are not carried out in
   an adequate manner, or produce unacceptable results. Resources and programs are
   mismanaged or evidence of fraud, waste and abuse are evident. Significant deficiencies exist
   that preclude or seriously limit mission accomplishment.
3.5. AF Management Inspection MGAs.
   3.5.1. Strategic Planning. Strategic planning is an organization’s process of defining its
   strategy, or direction for the future. Strategic planning includes key performance indicators,
   surveys, benchmark data, and other quality information to ensure that strategic planning is
   strong and viable for all parts of the organization.
      3.5.1.1. Assess the organization’s use of strategic planning to develop goals and
      objectives. Key indicators are: all levels of the organization participate in some form of
      strategic planning; employees and other stakeholders are engaged in strategic planning
      decisions; and leadership is actively involved in planning related activities.

                                         Chapter 4

                   THE UNIT EFFECTIVENESS INSPECTION (UEI).

4.1. General Information. The UEI integrates elements of compliance and readiness with new
inspection elements to create a new IG inspection of unit effectiveness. Conducted by
MAJCOM IGs, AFIA and AFISRA on Wings (as defined in paragraph 2.2), the UEI is a
continual evaluation of performance throughout the inspection period—a “photo album” versus a
snapshot. The inspection period begins immediately after the close-out of the previous UEI
report. The UEI inspects the following four MGAs—Managing Resources, Leading People,
Improving the Unit and Executing the Mission—and the sub-MGAs detailed in Attachment 4.
4.2. Purpose. UEIs validate and verify a Wing’s CCIP for accuracy, adequacy and relevance,
and provide an independent assessment of the Wing’s resource management, leadership, process
improvement efforts and ability to execute the mission. A UEI is a years-long, continual
inspection of the unit’s effectiveness, and is intended to help the Wing Commander understand
the areas of greatest risk from undetected non-compliance.
4.3. UEI Sequence of Events. Using a risk-based methodology; the MAJCOM/IG will follow
the UEI sequence of events in the conduct of a UEI (see Figure 4.1). A final report and grade
will be determined and provided to the Wing commander and MAJCOM commander. This
report will include 2 grades: one grade on the Wing’s effectiveness and another grade on the
adequacy of resources provided to the Wing.

Figure 4.1. UEI Sequence of Events.




4.4. Duties and Responsibilities.
   4.4.1. MAJCOM/CC:
       4.4.1.1. Implement the UEI in accordance with HQ USAF PAD 13-01, Implementation

             4.4.2.1.1. With the purpose of the UEI in mind, build a tailored sample strategy for
             each wing based on this Instruction’s Attachment 3, input from SECAF, CSAF, TIG,
             MAJCOM/CC, NAF/CC, Wing/CC, MAJCOM FAMs (or FOA as appropriate),
             MICT data, survey results, virtual inspections, and available IG resources.
             4.4.2.1.2. Coordinate with respective Gatekeeper to schedule and synchronize all on-
             site visits conducted as part of the continuous evaluation or capstone event.
         4.4.2.1.3. Gaining MAJCOM will conduct UEI continual evaluation of ANG Wing
         throughout the UEI cycle, unless inspection responsibility has been transferred through
         Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between MAJCOM/IGs and coordinated through
         NGB-IG.
         4.4.2.2. Validate and verify the Wing CCIP.
         4.4.2.3. Work with MAJCOM/DRU/FOA leadership to identify a MICT program
         manager to assist Wings in MICT implementation and verify FAM checklist
         standardization.
      4.4.3. MAJCOM FAMs:
         4.4.3.1. Coordinate with the MAJCOM/IG to identify areas of interest and/or emphasis
         items for the UEI by monitoring data from each Wing through MICT and trend analysis.
         4.4.3.2. Identify and provide inspector augmentees with functional expertise, as
         requested by MAJCOM/IG.
         4.4.3.3. For areas in which a MAJCOM HQ has limited expertise due to consolidation of
         subject-matter-experts to FOAs, MAJCOM FAMs will work with supporting FOAs to
         execute the UEI continual evaluation process.
4.5. UEI Methodology. The following guidance will be used to assist the MAJCOM/IG in
developing sound inspection policy for conducting the UEI.
      4.5.1. Inspection Team. The MAJCOM/IG will assemble a team to perform the inspection
      and submit the report to the Wing/CC, NAF/CC and MAJCOM/CC upon completion. The
      inspection team will consist of a sufficient number of assigned IG inspectors and augmentees
      as required to conduct UEI inspections under the authority of the MAJCOM/IG.
         4.5.1.1. When non-IG inspections are synchronized by the MAJCOM Gatekeeper, the
         MAJCOM/IG Team Chief will coordinate with the non-IG inspection Team Leader to
         minimize any adverse effects on the unit’s mission and to prevent any unnecessary
         duplication of effort or use of installation resources.
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                              53


   4.5.2. Inspection Sampling Strategy. The UEI is not primarily focused on detecting non-
   compliance; rather, the UEI should validate and verify the commander’s own compliance
   detection program, identifying areas for the Wing CC where he/she has significant risk of
   undetected non-compliance. HAF Functionals have identified in Attachment 3 areas where
   the risk from undetected non-compliance is greatest for a wing CC, an Airman or the Air
   Force. To identify areas where there may be risk of undetected non-compliance, the
   MAJCOM IG team must develop a sampling strategy for each Wing that inspects the
   mandatory items in Atch 3 (indicated by an “X” in the Mandatory column) and samples the
   other Atch 3 areas based on the IG’s assessment of the following:
       4.5.2.1. SECAF and CSAF areas of emphasis and Special Interest Items.
       4.5.2.2. MAJCOM commander’s areas of emphasis and Command Interest Items.
       4.5.2.3. TIG and MAJCOM/IG.
       4.5.2.4. HAF and MAJCOM Functional Authority areas of emphasis, including
       mandatory items in Attachment 3.
       4.5.2.5. MICT and IGEMS data and other metrics.
       4.5.2.6. Wing commander’s Inspection Reports.
       4.5.2.7. Maturity and reliability of individual Wing commander’s Inspection Programs.
       4.5.2.8. Wing commander-requested emphasis areas. Wing commanders may request
       the MAJCOM IG team focus on certain programs or units for further validation or
       verification.
       4.5.2.9. Inspection resource availability (e.g. TDY funds, inspectors).
   4.5.3. Frequency. MAJCOM/IGs will establish a 24-30 month UEI cycle for each Active
   Duty and Reserve Wing, and a 48-60 month UEI cycle for ANG Wings. All elements of the
   UEI will be completed within this timeframe (i.e., continual evaluation, survey, on-site
   capstone inspection, and report) IAW this instruction. AFRC Wings will be inspected by HQ
   AFRC and Gaining MAJCOM IGs on a 48-60 month cycle resulting in a UEI every 24-30
   months based on a rotational schedule between AFRC and the Gaining MAJCOM.
       4.5.3.1. TFI Wings.
          4.5.3.1.1. MAJCOM/IGs will coordinate with the AD and ARC Wing CCs of
          Associate Wings to determine reasonable/practical scope and scale of the units’
          participation in scheduled inspections.
          4.5.3.1.2. In addition to the Capstone visit, ANG Wings will receive an additional
          on-site visit from the gaining MAJCOM IG near the 24-month point. The Gaining
          MAJCOM IG will ensure ESOH inspection requirements are accomplished during
          this additional on-site inspection.
          4.5.3.1.3. For TFI associations in which one or both units is graded INEFFECTIVE,
          the G-MAJCOM IG(s) will coordinate with both wing CCs to determine re-inspection
          timeline and scope.
4.6. Continual Evaluation. The continual evaluation phase of the UEI begins immediately
after the previous UEI report is signed. IGs should use all available Wing performance data to
 54                                                  AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


develop their overall assessment, including, but not limited to: FAM input, MICT data, external
inspection results and Wing CCIP reports. The IG may also find that the best opportunities to
inspect the Wing’s ability to execute their mission occur during the continual evaluation phase,
through virtual or on-site inspections. These opportunities may be with notice, limited notice or
no-notice, and include, but are not limited to: exercises, training events and actual mission
performance. The information gathered will be part of the overall rating and grade.
      4.6.1. MICT and IGEMS sampling. Virtual sampling adds a critical no-notice element to the
      UEI, particularly as it helps validate and verify a Wing’s CCIP. Wings should not be notified
      of virtual sampling. The MAJCOM IG should determine a sampling strategy of the items
      listed in AFI 90-201, Attachment 3 based on a risk assessment considering the criticality of
      the area, Wing performance and available MAJCOM staff resources.
      4.6.2. Wing Commanders’ Inspection Reports (CCIR). Wing CCs will submit CCIRs IAW
      Chapter 5. (T-1) These reports should inform the sample strategy of the MAJCOM IG.
      Identified deficiencies in a Wg/CC CCIR are an excellent opportunity for MAJCOM IGs to
      sample Root Cause Analysis and commitment to continuous improvement. UEI reports and
      grades should reflect the outcome of RCA efforts and the resolution of issues identified in
      CCIRs.
4.7. UEI survey.
      4.7.1. The MAJCOM IG will administer an online survey to the Wing to capture candid,
      confidential beliefs, attitudes and opinions about matters relevant to the four UEI MGAs.
      The purpose of the survey is threefold: to gather data since the last on-site evaluation, to
      assist in determining the inspection team composition and to develop the sampling strategy
      for the capstone, on-site evaluation.
      4.7.2. Prior to the capstone event, the MAJCOM/IG will send the Wing commander
      instructions on completing the survey and making sure all Wing members have access and
      ample time to complete the survey. The survey should be made available to Wing personnel
      approximately 90 days prior to the Capstone event (180 days prior for ARC Wings).
      MAJCOM IG personnel should close out the survey on a date that provides Wing personnel
      ample opportunity to complete the survey while also allowing MAJCOM IG personnel ample
      time to analyze survey results before the Capstone event.
      4.7.2. (AFMC) Contractors should not participate in surveys unless otherwise provided for
      under terms of their contract.
      4.7.3. Survey results will help inspection teams understand Airmen’s attitudes, beliefs and
      perceptions to more precisely target a sample strategy for the on-site capstone visit.
      MAJCOMs will use the SAF/IGI-approved survey and may add up to 5 MAJCOM-unique
      questions to help prepare for their on-site inspection. The survey results and analysis are
      intended for IG use only.
      4.7.4. Survey participants are assured that results will not be shown to their chain of
      command, and survey administrators will honor that promise. Under no circumstances will
      Wing commanders receive copies of survey results.
      4.7.5. IG complaints in the UEI survey.
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                            55


       4.7.5.1. The UEI survey is not intended to be used to file formal IG complaints.
       However, all complaints, from any source (including ano nymous), via any method, must
       be handled IAW the complaint resolution process outlined in AFI 90-301, Inspector
       General Complaints Resolution.
       4.7.5.2. UEI survey results will be screened by MAJCOM IG members for potential
       complaints. Any suspected complaints will be handed off to properly-trained complaints
       resolution personnel and processed IAW AFI 90-301.
       4.7.5.3. MAJCOM IG complaints resolution personnel will determine whether the
       complaint is already under investigation via ACTS and/or contacting the installation IG.
       4.7.5.4. Complaints should be handed off to the Wing or installation IG when
       appropriate, unless otherwise prohibited in AFI 90-301.
       4.7.5.5. Any significant trends identified during this process should shape the on-site
       sampling strategy for the UEI.
   4.7.6. Team Chief out brief will include feedback to the Wing on select significant trends
   and proposed courses of action without compromising participant confidentiality.
4.8. On-site Capstone Visit. The on-site visit is the capstone event of the UEI and the catalyst
for generating a UEI report. The capstone event is intended to last approximately one week,
during which time the IG will validate and verify the CCIP, conduct Airmen-To-IG-Sessions,
and independently assess unit effectiveness through task evaluations, audits and observation.
   4.8.1. Validation and Verification of CCIP. An accurate and trusted CCIP is the cornerstone
   of the AFIS. The validation and verification of CCIP is the most important part of a UEI.
   IAW paragraph 4.9.2.1, if the inspection team believes CCIP is not accurate, adequate or
   relevant, grade the Wing INEFFECTIVE.
   4.8.2. Airmen to IG Sessions (ATIS). An ATIS is either a small group (10-15 people) led
   through a structured discussion by a trained facilitator (ATIS-G), or an individual being
   interviewed by the IG (ATIS-I). An ATIS group (ATIS-G) needs to be large enough to
   generate meaningful discussion with the facilitator, ensuring each attendee participates,
   provides feedback and contributes to the discussion. An ATIS-I gathers an individual’s
   perspective on issues the IG might need to further inspect.
       4.8.2.1. MAJCOM IGs will capture issues identified by Airmen during ATIS-Gs for
       SECAF consideration, and enter the top 5 issues into IGEMS categorized by UEI sub-
       MGA. The IG will cull the Top 5 issues based on his/her judgment of the criticality and
       breadth of the issues brought forward during ATIS-Gs.
       4.8.2.2. Inspection teams will have a handoff plan in place in the event a complainant
       comes forward during the on-site inspection. All inspectors will have contact
       information immediately available to contact an appropriately-trained complaints
       resolution IG member.
   4.8.3. On-site Audits, Evaluations, and Observations. Wing performance will play a part in
   determining the scope and depth of the on-site IG visit. Excellent performance throughout
   the UEI period may reduce the depth and scope of the inspection sample. Conversely,
   questionable performance may require a broader or deeper inspection.
 56                                                  AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


      4.8.3. (AFMC) HQ AFMC/IG may conduct these Audits, Evaluations, and Observations
      either minimal-/no-notice. If conducted no-notice, the HQ AFMC/IG Team Chief will
      present and Entry Authorization List (EAL) to the Command Post on the first day of the visit.
         4.8.3.1. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC/IG may conduct UEI Continuous-Evaluation
         Observations (UCO) of organizations that are subordinate to/geographically separated
         from their parent CCIP. Information gathered from these UCOs will be used to complete
         the UEI of the parent CCIP. For example, a UCO of AFLCMC organizations at Eglin
         AFB and/or Peterson AFB will be used to complete the UEI of AFLCMC during a
         Capstone visit at Wright-Patterson AFB.
         4.8.3.2. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC/IG audits include, but are not limited to Logistics
         Process Audits (LPA), Life Cycle Management Process Audits (LCMPA), Science and
         Technology Process Audits (STPA), Test and Evaluation Process Audits (TEPA).
4.9. UEI Reports. The UEI Report covers the entire UEI period. Once the MAJCOM/IG
report is submitted, the Wing immediately enters into the next UEI cycle. The UEI report will
specifically include two distinct grades. One grade will be the Wing grade, the other is the
“adequacy of resources” grade. The adequacy grade provides a MAJCOM/CC an assessment of
the support the Wing is getting from HHQ staffs. The report will not reveal any survey ATIS-
G/I data disaggregated below the wing level. Additionally, comply with inspection report
guidance found in Chapter 2.
      4.9.1. UEI Rating.
         4.9.1.1. MAJCOM IG Teams will use the following UEI grading methodology:
             4.9.1.1.1. MAJCOM IG teams will use the UEI grading tool provided by SAF/IGI.
             4.9.1.1.2. Multiple inspectors will assess each sub-MGA, using all available data
             gathered during the entire UEI cycle.
             4.9.1.1.3. Each inspector will independently assign a score between 1 and 10.
             Inspectors will then compare scores and adjudicate differences until all scores are
             within three points of each other. These scores are then averaged and entered on the
             score sheet.
         4.9.1.2. Each MGA is equal in weight (25% each).
         4.9.1.3. Within MGAs 1-3, each sub-MGA is worth the same amount. For example, if
         there are 5 sub-MGAs, then they are each worth 20% of the MGA score. If there are 4
         sub-MGAs, each is worth 25% of the MGA score.
         4.9.1.4. Within MGA 4, Executing the Mission, MAJCOM IG teams must determine
         appropriate weights for the 3 mission areas. For host Wings with a significant AEF
         readiness mission, the recommended baseline is equal weighting.
      4.9.2. MAJCOM IGs will use the 5-tier grading system found in paragraph 4.9.4 An
      INEFFECTIVE rating shall be handled as follows:
         4.9.2.1. Criticality of CCIP Effectiveness. If the MAJCOM/IG scores the Wing’s CCIP
         at less than 15 (i.e., the threshold for INEFFECTIVE), regardless of performance in other
         areas, the overall UEI rating will be INEFFECTIVE (see paragraph 4.9.2.1.1 below). In
         this case, the Wing will receive a rigorous compliance-focused on-site IG visit to validate
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                              57


     and verify CCIP within 90 days (180 days for ARC). The highest possible score for this
     90-day (180 days for ARC) CCIP val/ver is 65, and MAJCOM/CC approval is required
     to exceed the 90-day (180 days for ARC) requirement. If the Wing receives a score
     between 35-65 (the EFFECTIVE band of UEI scores) during the 90-day (180 days for
     ARC) CCIP val/ver, the Wing begins a shortened 1-year (2 years for ARC) UEI cycle. If
     the Wing receives a score above 35 (i.e, the threshold for EFFECTIVE) on this 1-year (2
     years for ARC) UEI report, the wing returns to the normal UEI cycle (24-30 months, or
     48-60 months as appropriate).
         4.9.2.1.1. Grading CCIP during first UEI. Prior to 1 Oct 16, the MAJCOM/IG will
         inspect and grade CCIP during a Wing’s first UEI, but will not include the CCIP
         score in the MGA 3 score or the overall UEI score. (T-2) For subsequent UEIs (and
         all after 1 Oct 16), the MAJCOM/IG will include the CCIP score in the MGA 3 score
         and in the overall UEI score.
         4.9.2.1.1. (AFMC) HQ AFMC/IG will include the CCIP score in the MGA 3 score
         and the overall UEI score during the first and all subsequent UEIs.
     4.9.2.2. Overall INEFFECTIVE ratings. If a Wing is rated INEFFECTIVE in any area
     other than CCIP, schedule an on-site IG visit within 6 months (1 year for ARC).
     MAJCOM/CC approval is required to exceed the 6-month (1 year for ARC) interval. The
     MAJCOM/IG will determine whether to re-accomplish the entire Capstone event during
     the on-site IG visit or to limit inspection efforts during the on-site IG visit to only those
     MGAs rated MARGINALLY INEFFECTIVE or INEFFECTIVE.
  4.9.3. Team Chiefs have final decision authority for the grades and ratings assigned during a
  UEI.
  4.9.4. Five-Tier Rating System.
     4.9.4.1. OUTSTANDING – Given for a UEI score between 85 and 100, this rating
     indicates the Wing meets/exceeds the criteria for a HIGHLY EFFECTIVE rating AND
     most or all of the following are consistently true:
         4.9.4.1.1. Mission activities, programs and processes are executed in an increasingly
         cost-effective manner.
         4.9.4.1.2. Results of long-term commitment to continuous process improvement are
         evident.
         4.9.4.1.3. Leaders’ decisions and priorities demonstrate genuine care for their

         4.9.4.1.5. Widespread evidence of high proficiency, unit pride and cohesion.
         4.9.4.1.6. Programs and processes are institutionalized and produce highly reliable
         results.
         4.9.4.1.7. Programs are nearly deficiency-free, and efforts to benchmark and share
         lessons learned with other Wings are evident.

AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                              59


       4.9.4.4. MARGINALLY EFFECTIVE – Given for a UEI score greater than 15 and less
       than or equal to 35, this rating indicates the Wing does not meet the criteria for an
       EFFECTIVE rating, and some or all of the following are consistently true:
          4.9.4.4.1. Requirements are met in some but not all mission areas (Primary, AEF,
          Mission Assurance C2).

          the Air Force.
          4.9.4.4.9. Management systems have some elements by are not working in a cohesive
          process.
       4.9.4.5. INEFFECTIVE – Given for a UEI score between 0 and 15, this rating indicates
       the Wing does not meet all of the criteria for an EFFECTIVE rating, and some or all of
       the following are consistently true:
          4.9.4.5.1. Wing does not demonstrate ability to meet mission requirements.
          4.9.4.5.2. Evidence exists of systemic non-compliance or widespread disregard for
          prescribed procedures.
          4.9.4.5.3. The number and severity of deficiencies preclude or seriously limit mission
          accomplishment.
          4.9.4.5.4. CCIP does not provide an accurate, adequate or relevant picture of unit
          performance.
          4.9.4.5.5. Leaders do not treat Airmen with respect or do not provide a healthy and
          safe work environment.
          4.9.4.5.6. Resources and programs are grossly mismanaged.
          4.9.4.5.7. Management systems are not evident.
4.10. UEI Augme ntee Support to MAJCOM/IG. MAJCOM/IG teams do not have fully
qualified experts assigned from every AFSC, which may necessitate augmentation from qualified
Subject Matter Experts (SME) from throughout the Air Force. Included among these are:
   4.10.1. Air Force Metrology and Calibration (AFMETCAL). AFMETCAL will provide a
   team of IG-certified inspectors for the respective MAJCOM UEIs on wings with Precision

     Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL) inspection requirements. MAJCOM IGs
     should request SMEs from AFMETCAL/WMNQ. Metrology inspection requirements will
     be coordinated using the AF Inspection Scheduling Process. If inspection demand exceeds
     AFMETCAL inspection capabilities, MAJCOM Functionals will provide trained SMEs as
     required.
     4.10.2. Air Force Civil Engineering Center (AFCEC). AFCEC will provide a team of IG-
     certified inspectors for the respective MAJCOM UEIs on wings with ESOH inspection
     requirements. MAJCOM IGs should request SMEs from AFCEC/CZCA (NGB/A7AN for
     ANG inspections). Environmental inspection requirements will be coordinated using the AF
     Inspection Scheduling Process. If inspection demand exceeds AFCEC inspection capabilities,
     MAJCOM Functionals will provide trained SMEs as required.

                THE COMMANDER’S INSPECTION PROGRAM (CCIP)

5.1. General Information. A validated and trusted CCIP is the cornerstone of AFIS. CCIP
should give the Wing Commander, subordinate commanders and wing Airmen the right
information at the right time to assess risk, identify areas of improvement, determine root cause
and precisely focus limited resources—all aligned with the commander’s priorities and on the
commander’s timeline. CCIP also facilitates requests for targeted assistance from the
MAJCOM/CC and staff when/where needed. In addition, CCIP’s two outputs–the Wing
Commander’s Inspection Report (CCIR) and MICT data–provide critical data to HAF and
MAJCOM staffs about the adequacy of policy, training, manpower, funds, equipment and
facilities.

Figure 5.1. Key Questions for CCs.




   5.1.1. CCIP Requirements. CCIP is mandatory for Wings defined in this instruction in
   paragraph 2.2. (T-0) CCIP will inspect Wing-wide and subordinate unit effectiveness, as
   well as assessing cross-unit programs as directed by the Wing commander. (T-1)
   Commanders will determine the appropriate scope, scale, timing and methodology to most
   effectively accomplish the objectives of CCIP IAW this instruction. (T-3)
       5.1.1.1. CCIP Key Components (see Figure 5.2).
           5.1.1.1.1. A Wing inspection program, executed by the Wing IG with support from
           SMEs on the WIT, that inspects wing-wide performance and programs, and
           organizations below the Wing level.
           5.1.1.1.2. A self-assessment program, using MICT, that reports compliance with
           requirements listed in SACs to the chain of command and appropriate staffs.
       5.1.1.2. The Commander’s Inspection Management Board (CIMB) will review CCIP
       deficiencies, root causes and corrective action plans, and upcoming CCIP events. (T-1)
       5.1.1.3. CCIP will assess and report using the same four major graded areas (MGAs),
       managing resources, leading people, improving the unit and executing the mission, and
       sub-MGAs as the UEI. (T-1) Wing IGs may use the five-tier UEI rating system found in
       paragraph 4.9.4
 62                                                  AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


Figure 5.2. Commander’s Inspection Program.




      5.1.2. CCIP Methodology. The Wing IG/CCIP Director will develop an annual inspection
      plan approved by the Wing Commander. (T-3) The annual inspection plan should include
      inspections of the effectiveness of the Wing, subordinate units and programs to meet the
      Wing Commander’s intent. The main focus of inspections should be on individual
      organizations, while still allowing programs and processes across the Wing to be periodically
      inspected. The annual plan should include at least one no-notice Wing inspection and a no-
      notice spot-inspection.
5.2. Purpose. The purpose of CCIP is to improve effectiveness, compliance, readiness,
discipline and surety in Air Force Wings while allowing Wing/CCs the ability to assess their
own unique mission sets in reference to Designed Operational Capabilities (DOC) statements,
Mission Essential Task List (METL) and Universal Joint Task Lists (UJTL), mission directives,
unit type code (UTC) and other authoritative tasking documents. CCIP will help the Wing
commanders reduce the risk of undetected non-compliance.
5.3. Commander’s Authority to Inspect. All commanders appointed by G-series orders are
expected to assess their organization. Commanders will inspect to improve unit performance,
military discipline, readiness, efficiency, effectiveness and quality of life for their Airmen. (T-0)
5.4. Inspection Guidelines. The following guidance will be used to help Wing commanders
and their Wing IG/CCIP Director develop a sound inspection plan for CCIP to identify and
validate a deficiency and enter it into MICT. The Wing IG/CCIP Director will identify and enter
into IGEMS all IG-validated deficiencies. (T-1)
      5.4.1. Inspections are an inherent function of command. Inspections allow commanders to
      hold leaders at all levels accountable for readiness, compliance and discipline. Internal
      inspections allow the commander to determine appropriate training and resourcing
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                           63


  requirements; assess status of discipline; evaluate Wing readiness; and formulate command
  welfare strategies.
  5.4.2. Commanders will clearly communicate the priority they place on CCIP and
  periodically participate in inspections of units under their command. (T-2)
     5.4.2.1. Although a Wing may not have attained all CCIP-capable criteria (as described
     in Chapter 5 of HQ USAF PAD 13-01), the MAJCOM/IG may execute an on-site
     Capstone visit at the Wing.
  5.4.3. Commanders will determine the amount of notice given for inspections, in line with
  the intent to evaluate daily effectiveness while reducing the wasteful practice of inspection
  preparation. (T-2)
  5.4.4. Wing IGs will consolidate inspections to avoid redundancy, and eliminate inspections
  which are not mission-essential and whose benefits do not outweigh their costs. Do not
  inspect non mission-essential items/areas that detract from mission readiness and waste time
  and initiative. (T-3)
  5.4.5. Internal Sources of Unit Performance Data. The Wing Commander relies on many
  sources of internal information to evaluate and assess his/her Wing. Integrating and
  analyzing multiple sources enables a comprehensive understanding of unit readiness,
  compliance and surety. These sources include, but are not limited to:
     5.4.5.1. Status reports/SORTS/ART/DRRS.
     5.4.5.2. Wing Quality Assurance (QA) program.
     5.4.5.3. Wing Standardization/Evaluation.
     5.4.5.4. Wing IG reports.
     5.4.5.5. Individual Medical Readiness (IMR) Wing reports.
     5.4.5.6. Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) status meeting minutes.
     5.4.5.7. Personal observations.
     5.4.5.8. Climate surveys.
     5.4.5.9. Self-Assessment programs. Self-assessment provides commanders with a means
     for internal assessment of a Wing’s overall health and complements external assessments.
     The primary purpose of the self-assessment program is to accurately identify and report
     issues to the command chain. Wings will complete/validate baseline self-assessment of
     all applicable HAF SACs within 30 days (180 days for ARC) of the effective date of this
     Instruction. (T-1)
         5.4.5.9.1. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC/IG documents assessments of Unit Self-
         Assessment Programs in inspection reports. Prior to an inspection, HQ AFMC/IG
         will review inspected organizations’ MICT data. In general, self-identified
         deficiencies with good root cause analysis and CAPs should not affect the five-tier
         rating. However, if there are a large number of open Critical/Significant
         deficiencies, they must be weighed against the unit’s ability to conduct its mission
         when assigning a grade. HQ AFMC/IG does not want to penalize units for taking
         responsibility in identifying deficiencies and making progress toward compliance, but
64                                              AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


        a CAP is only that – a plan and not a complete and informative picture of the unit’s
        health. Self-identified deficiencies without well thought-out CAPs, or without
        appropriate progress made (as determined by the UEI inspector), can be documented
        in the UEI report as a UEI-identified deficiency and may impact the rating. CAPs and
        supporting documentation with enough detail to conduct virtual inspections must be
        uploaded in MICT for higher level review/validation. Self-identified deficiencies
        without sufficient CAPs uploaded in MICT will not be considered in the inspected
        organization’s USAP assessment (i.e., no CAP credit given).
     5.4.5.10. Self-Assessment Checklists (SACs).
        5.4.5.10.1. Commanders will ensure their assigned SACs accurately reflect current
        status at all times. (T-1) A change in compliance status will be updated in MICT
        within 5 duty days. (T-3) Wings will complete baseline self-assessment of all
        applicable HAF and applicable MAJCOM SACs within 30 days (180 days for ANG)
        of the effective date of this Instruction. (T-1)
        5.4.5.10.2. Commanders will appoint a Self-Assessment Program Manager at the
        Wing, Group and Squadron level. (T-3) Each program manager will utilize MICT to
        record self-assessments. Wings will use HAF SACs and Deficiency Cause Codes
        listed in Attachment 7, when conducting self-assessments. (T-1) Each program
        manager will identify individual assessors for each SAC based on how each SAC was
        assigned by the HAF. (T-3)
        5.4.5.10.3. Commanders will define the roles of the Group and Squadron Self-
        Assessment Program Managers. (T-3)
        5.4.5.10.4. Problem-solving responsibility and the corrective action process reside at
        the lowest appropriate command level. Problem-solving will be applied using
        appropriate RCA tools, such as the AF 8-Step Problem Solving Model as outlined in
        the AF AFSO21 playbook.
        5.4.5.10.5. Commander’s Inspection Report (CCIR). Wing Commanders will
        periodically report their assessment of the four MGAs to their MAJCOM/CC (gaining
        MAJCOM/CC for ANG wings). (T-1) Reports will be sent within 90 days (180 days
        for ARC) of assuming command and annually thereafter. (T-2) NAF and Center
        commanders will receive a courtesy copy of the CCIR. (T-2) At a minimum, the
        CCIR will include the Wing CC’s assessment of the four MGAs and sub-MGAs over
        the reporting period using the CCIR Template at Attachment 10. (T-1) Route reports
        IAW Figure 5.3.(T-2)
        5.4.5.10.5. (AFMC) Commanders will also send their annual CCIR to HQ
        AFMC/IG and their respective Center IG. (T-2)
            5.4.5.10.5.1. ANG Wing commanders will forward their CCIR through their state
            staff to the State Adjutant General, who will forward the report to NGB-IGD.
            NGB-IGD will forward the CCIR to ANGRC/CC and Director, ANG. (T-1)
     5.4.5.11. AEF Reporting Tool (ART).

Figure 5.3. Commander’s Inspection Report Routing.




5.5. Commander’s Inspection Management Board (CIMB).
   5.5.1. The Wing CIMB will meet monthly (quarterly for ARC). (T-3) The focus of the
   CIMB must be to reduce the risk of undetected non-compliance, to manage the risk from
   known areas of non-compliance, and to ensure the wing inspection plan meets the
   commander’s requirements. The CIMB will accomplish the following primary objectives:
   (T-3)
      5.5.1.1. Identify the areas where there may be risk of undetected non-compliance; assess
      the root cause of non-compliance; determine appropriate course of action to move into
      compliance; track progress of each action item; and review waiver status.
      5.5.1.2. Review status of corrective action plans for previous deficiencies.
      5.5.1.3. Review and discuss new inspection deficiencies since last CIMB and ensure
      OPRs are identified for each
      5.5.1.4. Review objectives and plans for upcoming CCIP events
   5.5.2. Required attendees at the CIMB. The board is chaired by the Wing commander (or
   the vice-Wing commander if the Wing commander is not available). Group commanders
   will attend, as will any designated Wing staff agency chiefs (Command post, plans and
   requirements, etc.). (T-3) Squadron commanders may attend at their Group commander’s
   discretion. The Wing IG is responsible for the administration of the CIMB. (T-3)
   5.5.3. Preparations for the CIMB include pulling applicable reports from MICT, sorting
   open deficiencies to identify trends and identifying deficiencies requiring external
   coordination (Joint-Base support, functional coordination, FAM, etc.). A thorough review of
   internal and external inspections will provide background for discussion.
 66                                                   AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


      5.5.4. The main focus of the CIMB should be on the status of all open inspection items, to
      include progress and updates on corrective action plans, estimated close-out date, mitigating
      circumstances, recommendations for closure (if warranted) and external assistance required.
      Group commanders will brief their CCIP status to include deficiencies, corrective action
      plans and issues affecting upcoming scheduled MAJCOM inspections and any requested
      SAVs. (T-2)
      5.5.5. The closure authority for deficiencies identified by the CCIP is the next higher
      commander (e.g., GP/CC for Squadron-level deficiencies, WG/CC (or WG/CV) for Group-
      level deficiencies). The Wing commander (or Vice-Wing commander) should be the closure
      authority for deficiencies in Wing programs, processes and Wing-level staff agencies. Close
      deficiencies when corrective action plans are in place and have the desired effect. (T-2)
      5.5.6. CIMB Brief. The CIMB should include the following:
         5.5.6.1. CCIP Dashboard (tailored report of key metrics Wing CC values)
         5.5.6.2. MICT Review – Checklist review cycle, questions, deficiencies/criticality,
         observations/trends
         5.5.6.3. Open Deficiency Review
         5.5.6.4. Self-Assessment Deficiencies Review; break out by unit; identify the top 5
         Deficiencies/concerns
         5.5.6.5. Gp/CC Objectives and Feedback
         5.5.6.6. Wg/CC Objectives and Feedback
         5.5.6.7. Upcoming events – include UEIs, Inspection Calendar, Gatekeeper events
5.6. Wing Inspection Team (WIT). The WIT should consist of a sufficient number of subject
matter experts from within the Wing (or regional-based FOA subject matter experts to support as
appropriate) to conduct CCIP inspections under the authority of the Wing commander, and under
the direction of the Wing IG/CCIP Director. WIT members are not assigned to the IG office;
rather they are detailed out of their normal work center to augment the IG team as an additional
duty. Specific duties include providing inputs for scenario development, inspecting assigned
areas/functions, evaluating scenarios, participating in the hot wash and providing inputs to the
inspection report. The WIT assists the CCIP Director in validating and verifying the Wing,
Group and Squadron self-assessment program results. Units with established Quality Assurance
(QA) positions may wish to assign these individuals as members of the WIT.
      5.6.1. All WIT members will be properly trained, certified in writing and sworn-in by oath.
      (T-1)
      5.6.2. IG duty is a position of high public trust. Personnel selected to be a WIT member
      must possess attributes of the highest professional standards and moral character. In additi on
      to these qualities, the WIT member should demonstrate adherence to the Air Force core
      values, be able to maintain a security clearance commensurate with the duties required,
      present good military bearing and appearance; and not have a conviction by court-martial or
      general officer letter of reprimand filed in the official military personnel file. (T-1)
      5.6.3. The Wing/IG will certify all WIT members have completed all appropriate Air Force
      and MAJCOM-specific inspector training, to include field observation IAW paragraph
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                              67


   2.5.1.1 of this Instruction. (T-1) A grace period for the field observation requirement extends
   to 1 Oct 2014 to allow commanders to mature their CCIP.
5.7. Self-Assessment Checklists (SAC). A self-assessment checklist is a two-way
communication tool designed to improve compliance with published guidance. HHQ functionals
populate SACs with compliance requirements from their publications and publish SACs in the
Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT). Then, as part of the Commander’s Inspection
Program, Airmen report compliance and non-compliance with SACs through MICT.
Commanders and functionals throughout the chain of command can monitor programs for near
real-time compliance and trends using MICT. SACs are created by functional experts to help
Airmen understand what’s most important, and to provide an efficient means of communicating
compliance or non-compliance up the chain of command and appropriate staffs. Compliance
with the items in a SAC does not relieve individual Airmen from knowing the requirements of
their programs and complying with guidance in Air Force Instructions and other policy
documents.
   5.7.1. IG use of SACs. SACs are not inspection checklists. SACs are one of many resources
   IGs may choose to use to complete inspection requirements.
   5.7.2. HAF Functionals will develop and publish in MICT a SAC with the Wing-level
   compliance requirements for each AFI or Air Force-level program.
      5.7.2.1. HAF SAC authors will only reference compliance items for which their 2-letter
      is the approving official (e.g., an AF/A2 SAC may not include items from an AF/A1
      AFI). HAF SAC authors may also reference Tier 0 (higher than AF-level) compliance
      items from policy documents for which the 2-letter has been assigned responsibility (e.g.,
      an AF/A10 SAC may include nuclear DODI compliance items).
      5.7.2.2. Any AFI that levies Wing-level (or lower) compliance, must be referenced in a
      SAC. SAC authors are not obligated to include every compliance item in a SAC.
      5.7.2.3. An individual Wing-level compliance item will not be referenced in multiple
      SACs.
      5.7.2.4. The requirements from more than one AFI or AFI-directed program may be
      consolidated into a single SAC.
      5.7.2.5. Every SAC item must be referenced to a Wing-level compliance item in Air
      Force Instructions and other policy documents.
      5.7.2.6. MAJCOM/DRU/FOA FAMs will supplement HAF SACs when supplements to
      HAF guidance drive compliance by the Wing.
      5.7.2.7. Wing commanders may supplement MAJCOM supplements.
      5.7.2.8. All SACs will be approved by the next higher HQ FAM (HAF approves
      MAJCOM, MAJCOM approves Wing, etc.). In addition, HAF and MAJCOM SACs will
      be coordinated through NGB (if applicable).
      5.7.2.9. When developing SACs, do not include higher level guidance in the
      supplemented SACs. MAJCOM-developed SACs will not contain any content from
      HAF-level guidance; NAF/Center-developed and Wing-developed SACs will not contain
      any content from guidance above NAF/Center or Wing, respectively. The intent of this
 68                                                 AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


         guidance is to ensure each level of command’s SACs reflect only the compliance items
         and tiering of that command’s guidance.
         5.7.2.10. Where there is no HAF SAC for specialized MAJCOM/DRU/FOA functions,
         MAJCOM/DRU/FOA FAMs may develop and maintain MAJCOM/DRU/FOA-specific
         SACs.
         5.7.2.11. All SACs will indicate the degree of criticality for each self-assessment item
         (Tier 0, 1, 2 or 3) IAW the tiering definitions in AFI 33-360, Publication and Forms
         Management. (T-1)
         5.7.2.12. HAF Functionals will review each of their SACs annually. HAF SAC
         review/updates will be conducted NLT 31 Jan with MAJCOM supplement
         review/updates conducted NLT 31 Mar.
         5.7.2.13. For each change to an AFI, AFI-mandated program or supplement requiring
         Wing compliance, the HAF/MAJCOM functional will update the affected SAC into the
         MICT database NLT 10 work days of the publication effective date. Wings will comply
         with requirements in paragraph 5.4.5.11 (T-1)
      5.7.3. SAC Naming Conventions. The SAC abbreviation on the MICT checklist shell will
      utilize the primary governing directive as the abbreviation at HAF, MAJCOM and Wing
      levels for both functionally-aligned and directive-driven SACs. SACs will use the following
      naming conventions:
         5.7.3.1. When using a single AFI as the source reference of a SAC, the HAF FAM will
         use the AFI number along with the long title of the checklist (e.g., “AFI 14-104 Oversight
         of Intelligence Activities”).
         5.7.3.2. When placing a single AFI’s requirements i n multiple SACs, and those SACs do
         not reference other AFIs, then add a descriptive adjective to the end of the title (e.g.,
         “AFI 90-201 The Air Force Inspection System – Nuclear Inspections”).
         5.7.3.3. When naming a SAC that uses multiple AFIs as its reference, the HAF FAM
         will use the functional name as the checklist title (e.g., Physical Security, Computer
         Security, PRP, etc.)
         5.7.3.4. When supplementing a SAC at the MAJCOM, the naming convention will
         follow HAF naming convention and include the MAJCOM identifier (e.g., “AFI 14-104
         Oversight of Intelligence Activities – ACC Supp”)
         5.7.3.5. When supplementing a SAC at the Wing level, the naming convention will
         follow HAF naming convention and include the Wing identifier (e.g., “AFI 14-104
         Oversight of Intelligence Activities – 341 MW Supp”). (T-1)
5.8. Roles and Responsibilities.
      5.8.1. Wing Commander will:
         5.8.1.1. Establish, execute and sustain a Wing CCIP. (T-0)
         5.8.1.2. Designate the Wing IG as the CCIP Director. (T-1)
         5.8.1.3. Identify and apportion manpower to administer an effective CCIP. (T-1)
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                               69

                                           Chapter 6

                     AIR FORCE NUCLEAR INSPECTION PROGRAMS

6.1. Nuclear Weapons Technical Inspections (NWTI). Nuclear weapon systems require
special consideration because of their political and military importance, their destructive power,
and the potential consequences of a nuclear weapon incident. NWTIs are performance and
compliance-based inspections and are conducted to evaluate a unit’s ability to manage nuclear
resources while complying with all nuclear surety standards (reference DODD 3150.02, DoD
Nuclear Weapons Surety Program). CJCSI 3263.05 is the governing Instruction for the conduct
of NWTIs. In instances where CJCSI 3263.05 specifies responsibilities for “Service,”
MAJCOMs fill that role. The Nuclear Surety Inspection (NSI) is the AF inspection used to
satisfy requirements of an NWTI. AF inspection teams will conduct NSIs in accordance with
CJCSI 3263.05 and reference this Instruction for additional AF-specific inspection requirements.
If there is conflict between CJCSI 3263.05 and this Instruction, CJCSI 3263.05 takes precedence.
See paragraph 1.5.7.4 and Attachment 3 for NWRM inspection guidance.
      6.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Support requirements for NSI. Units will provide team support
      outlined in Attachme nt 12, Team Support and Attachment 13, NSI Special Support
      Requirements. (T-2)
6.2. Nuclear Surety Inspector Eligibility, Training and Certification. In addition to the
requirements of Chapter 9, to fulfill inspection oversight data collection, MAJCOM/IGs will
provide training and certification status, IG experience level and number of NSIs conducted to
AFIA for tracking and trending.
6.3. Nuclear-Capable Unit Operational Certification and Operational Restriction. Refer to
AFI 63-125, Nuclear Certification Program and AFI 13-503, Nuclear-Capable Unit
Certification, Decertification and Restriction Program.
6.4. Initial Nuclear Surety Inspection (INSI). The INSI is the culminating step both in the
Operational Certification Process for certifying a unit as nuclear-capable as well certifying new
equipment and/or systems requiring nuclear certification. The Lead/using MAJCOM, in
coordination with HQ AFSEC/SEW, will determine the need for conducting an INSI based upon
AFI 63-125 and AFI 13-503 requirements. Applicable Functional(s) will develop READY/NOT
READY inspection criteria to be used by the MAJCOM/IG during the INSI. In order to meet
Oversight and Core Team responsibilities, MAJCOM/IGs will notify AFIA/NI at least 60
calendar days prior to inspection execution (refer to paragraphs 6.14.2 and 8.2). MAJCOM/IGs
will notify Nuclear Enterprise agencies of the inspection commencement and conclusion using
Attachment 6.
      6.4.1. For units not previously nuclear-certified, conduct an INSI prior to employing,
      storing, assembling, maintaining or transporting War Reserve (WR). Conduct an NSI within
      180 calendar days of the unit receiving an INSI READY rating. Unless waived by the
      MAJCOM/CC, the READY rating expires 180 calendar days after the unit receives the
      READY rating.
      6.4.2. For currently certified nuclear-capable units programmed to receive a new weapon
      system/delivery system, conduct an INSI of operations and maintenance supporting the new
      system prior to receipt. Conduct an NSI within 180 calendar days of the unit receiving an
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                            75


  INSI READY rating. Unless waived by the MAJCOM/CC, the READY rating expires 180
  calendar days after the unit receives the READY rating.
  6.4.3. For decertified nuclear-capable units, conduct an INSI prior to resuming those
  operations (employing, storing, assembling, maintaining or transporting WR) for which the
  unit has been decertified to accomplish, as specified by the MAJCOM/CC in the
  decertification directive. Once an INSI has been successfully accomplished and the nuclear -
  certified status reinstated, conduct an NSI within 180 calendar days of the unit receiving the
  INSI READY rating. Unless waived by the MAJCOM/CC, the READY rating expires 180
  calendar days after the unit receives the READY rating.
  6.4.4. A READY rating for an EOD team or nuclear airlift unit establishes the NWTI cycle
  for that unit IAW DODD 3150.02. A READY INSI rating and certification for new and/or
  modified facilities, equipment and/or systems does not alter or reset the unit’s existing NWTI
  cycle unless the INSI is accomplished in conjunction with a full-scale NSI.
  6.4.5. INSIs may be conducted in phases. If phased INSIs are conducted, the responsible
  MAJCOM will prepare an inspection plan identifying all required areas to be inspected by
  phase and forward the plan to HQ AFSEC/SEW for review and approval. A READY rating
  must be achieved and maintained for the phase of the INSI under evaluation before
  evaluating the next phase. All phases must be rated READY prior to assuming nuclear
  operations. Unless waived by the MAJCOM/CC, a Phased READY rating expires 180
  calendar days from issuance. Conduct a NSI, on all portions of the unit’s nuclear mission, to
  include the addition of all phases, within 180 calendar days of final INSI completion.
  6.4.6. (Added-AFMC) Nuclear-capable units must continually monitor changes that impact
  nuclear surety. Mission changes and modifications to maintenance and storage facilities,
  weapon systems, support equipment, etc. may affect nuclear certification. Unit-level
  organizations planning or implementing a change/modification to mission, facilities,
  weapons systems, or support equipment will coordinate these actions through applicable base
  agencies and the wing Weapons Safety Manager (WSM).                  Before initiating any
  change/modification, the Wing Commander will forward an INSI determination request to
  HQ AFMC/SEW to determine if an INSI is required. HQ AFMC/SEW will coordinate the
  request with functional organizations and notify the requesting commander of the decision.
  Note: If the change/modification included a Nuclear Certification Impact Statement (NCIS),
  Wing Commanders do not need to forward a separate INSI determination request. See AFI
  63-125, Nuclear Certification Program, for further guidance.
     6.4.6.1. (Added-AFMC) If an INSI is required, HQ AFMC/SEW will task the
     appropriate functional organization to develop evaluation procedures and READY/NOT
     READY criteria to be used during the INSI. HQ AFMC/SEW, along with functional
     organizations, will determine whether continued operations during modifications are
     authorized. HQ AFMC/SEW will coordinate evaluation procedures and criteria with
     functional organizations and HQ AFSC/SEW. Upon approval, HQ AFMC/SE will
     distribute evaluation procedures and criteria to HQ AFMC/IG, Wing WSM, and the
     affected unit. Note: If the NCIS process determines an INSI is required, HQ
     AFMC/SEW will task functional organizations for evaluation procedures and criteria
     upon receipt of the Basic Certification Requirements Plan.

         6.4.6.2. (Added-AFMC) Upon receipt of INSI evaluation procedures and criteria, Wing
         Commanders will request INSI dates by sending a request, in writing, to HQ AFMC/SE
         and HQ AFMC/IG. (T-2).
6.5. Nuclear Surety Inspection (NSI). An NSI assesses a unit’s ability to accomplish its
assigned nuclear weapons mission and produce reliable nuclear weapons in a safe and secure
environment in compliance with applicable directives. Additionally, an NSI inspects a unit’s
capability to safely and reliably receive, store, secure, assemble, transport, maintain, load, mate,
lock/unlock, test, render safe and employ nuclear weapons. Missile launch crews, aircrews,
command post controllers and release teams must demonstrate (through performance-based
assessments, testing, etc.) their knowledge of weapon acceptance procedures, nuclear weapon
system safety rules, and nuclear weapon control order handling and authentication procedures.
In order to meet Oversight and Core Team responsibilities, MAJCOM/IGs will notify the
AFIA/NI at least 60 calendar days prior to inspection execution (refer to paragraphs 6.14.2 and
8.2). MAJCOM/IGs will notify Nuclear Enterprise agencies of the inspection commencement
and conclusion using Attachment 6.
6.5. (AFMC)Units will treat training weapons as war reserve (WR) when used in any
evaluation. Any requested simulations must be approved prior to the start of the inspection by
the inspector. (T-2).
      6.5.1. Frequency of NSIs.
         6.5.1.1. Inspection Frequency. The Air Force received approval from Office of the
         Secretary of Defense (OSD) for a term of four years (CY12-CY16) to delegate waiver
         authority to MAJCOM/CC to participate in a test of a 24-month NSI frequency, instead
         of the currently required 18-month frequency. MAJCOM/CC must waive the 18-month
         frequency requirement in writing for each nuclear-capable unit in order to participate in
         this 24-month inspection test. MAJCOM/IGs will forward a copy of the waiver to
         SAF/IGI and maintain all copies of waivers until the end of the frequency test period.
         OSD’s temporary approval to inspect nuclear-capable units on a 24-month inspection
         frequency cycle will expire 31 May 2016. Upon expiration of OSD’s temporary
         approval, MAJCOM/IGs will conduct NSIs of each nuclear-capable unit IAW DODd
         3150.02. The frequency (date next scheduled inspection due) is based on the date of the
         unit outbrief.
             6.5.1.1.1. Waiver to Decertification Requirement for Expired NSI. If a nuclear-
             capable unit does not receive a NSI within the timing required by DODD 3150.02, the
             MAJCOM/CC may elect to continue the certification of a unit by waiving the
             decertification requirement IAW CJCSI 3263.05. The MAJCOM/CC will notify
             agencies required by CJCSI 3263.05 and provide informational copies to the CSAF
             and recipients listed in Table A6.2, Group 1. Waiver notification will include the
             date of the scheduled NSI.
      6.5.2. Sequencing with other inspections. MAJCOMs may conduct NSIs sequentially with
      other inspections.
6.6. Limited Nuclear Surety Inspection (LNSI). The LNSI is limited in scope and does not
evaluate all NSI areas applicable to the unit. A LNSI is designed to assess sustained
performance of nuclear surety while minimizing the inspection footprint on a unit’s operations.
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                            77


In order to meet Oversight and Core Team responsibilities, MAJCOM/IGs will notify the
AFIA/NI at least 60 calendar days prior to inspection execution (refer to paragraphs 6.14.2 and
8.2). MAJCOM/IGs will notify Nuclear Enterprise agencies of the inspection commencement
and conclusion using Attachment 6.
   6.6.1. MAJCOMs may conduct LNSIs to:
       6.6.1.1. Inspect one or more areas designated by the MAJCOM/CC or IG.
       6.6.1.2. Re-inspect MGA or sub-area(s) of a certified nuclear-capable unit that
       contributed to an overall UNSATISFACTORY or SUPPORT UNSATISFACTORY
       rating during a DNSI, NSI, or LNSI.
       6.6.1.3. Re-inspect MGA or sub-area(s) of a certified nuclear-capable unit that
       contributed to an adjectival MARGINAL or UNACCEPTABLE rating during a DNSI,
       NSI, or LNSI.
   6.6.2. No-/Minimal-Notice Inspections. In accordance with AF Nuclear Oversight Board
   direction and to meet annual no-/minimal-notice requirements for each Service in CJCSI
   3263.05 Enclosure D, each nuclear-capable unit will receive at least one no-notice or
   minimal-notice LNSI between each NSI. MAJCOMs will determine appropriately-sized
   teams to target specific areas of concern or interest. The accomplishment of an LNSI does
   not establish a new, or alter the existing, DoD-directed NSI inspection frequency.
       6.6.2.1. MAJCOM/IGs may exempt units from this LNSI requirement if a full-scale NSI
       is conducted at least every 12 months.
          6.6.2.1.1. Each MAJCOM IG will ensure units not receiving an LNSI between each
          NSI will have a Memo for Record signed by the MAJCOM/CC approving/exempting
          the unit from an LNSI. The MAJCOM/IG will forward a copy of this memo to
          SAF/IGI.
6.7. Nuclear Inspection Rating System.
   6.7.1. For INSIs, assign a Ready or Not Ready rating.
   6.7.2. For NSIs, assign overall unit ratings and MGA adjectival ratings as specified in CJCSI
   3263.05 for NWTIs, with the following exception:
       6.7.2.1. Rate unit weapons denial and recapture/recovery emergency exercise as
       ACCEPTABLE or UNACCEPTABLE (a pass or fail rating).
   6.7.3. For LNSIs, assign overall unit ratings as specified for NSIs in CJCSI 3263.05.
   Assigning MGA adjectival ratings will be at the discretion of the MAJCOM/IG. Unless an
   MGA was inspected to the same level/depth of a full-scale NSI, adjectival ratings should be
   limited to ACCEPTABLE, MARGINAL or UNACCEPTABLE.
6.8. Reporting Criteria. For NSIs, LNSIs, and INSIs, reports will only identify Strengths,
Deficiencies, and RIAs. RIAs will not be used to document procedural deviations or non-
compliance; they should be used to recommend a more efficient or effective course of action.
   6.8.1. Nuclear Surety Deficiencies and Corrective Actions. For reporting purposes, each
   NSI, LNSI, or INSI deficiency, as defined in CJCSI 3263.05, will:
78                                                  AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


        6.8.1.1. Be categorized as CRITICAL, SIGNIFICANT, or MINOR as defined in CJCSI
        3263.05.
            6.8.1.1.1. (Added-AFMC) When an HQ AFMC/IG inspector identifies a potential
            Critical deficiency, the inspection Team Chief will contact HQ AFMC/A10 to
            assemble the appropriate subject matter experts (SMEs) and staff agencies to review
            the observed deficiency and provide input to the inspection team chief regarding 1)
            compliance with guidance and standards and 2) potential impact on safety, security
            and reliability. SMEs and Functional Staff will not offer input regarding severity of
            the potential deficiency; the HQ AFMC/IG has the sole responsibility to determine
            severity.
            6.8.1.1.2. (Added-AFMC) When the NSI Team Chief determines a potential
            deficiency is a Critical deficiency, the NSI Team Chief will submit a formal
            notification memorandum to the appropriate inspected unit leadership.
        6.8.1.2. Be assigned a unique tracking number.
        6.8.1.3. Reference the applicable instruction, technical order, or other source
        documentation.
        6.8.1.4. Address impact of continued deviation or noncompliance.
        6.8.1.5. Identify the OPR for correcting the deficiency.
        6.8.1.6. Include the OCR, if applicable.
        6.8.1.7. Provide additional comments required to explain deficiency, if applicable.
     6.8.2. Corrective Actions. See paragraph 2.20.9
        6.8.2.1. Host and Tenant Deficiencies. When responsibility for corrective actions is
        assigned to both the host and tenant unit (or supported and supporting unit),
        MAJCOM/IGs will communicate to ensure primary (OPR) and OCR responsibility
        actions for deficiency resolution have properly occurred.
        6.8.2.2. Deficiencies Outside Inspected Unit’s Control. Deficiencies attributed to
        inspecting MAJCOM staff will be managed by the MAJCOM/IG using the same process
        as described in paragraph 2.16 For deficiencies outside the inspecting MAJCOM’s
        control, the supporting MAJCOM’s staff and IG CARS monitor will coordinate replies
        through inspecting MAJCOM/IG and AFIA. AFIA will monitor and request updates
        from the responsible agency.
        6.8.2.3. For deficiencies from DTRA Inspections, see paragraph 6.13.2 and CJCSI
        3263.05 added instructions.
     6.8.3. Non-Surety Deficiencies. Document non-surety deficiencies in the non-surety section
     of the NSI report. In general, deficiencies will be categorized as non-surety if the
     deficiency's referenced policy is neither a primary nuclear policy document, a suppl ement to
     a primary nuclear policy document or referenced within a primary nuclear policy document.
     For example, a deficiency against the wing IG for failing to comply with AFI 90-201, would
     typically be considered a non-surety deficiency. However, a deficiency against AFMAN 31-
     108 or a MAJCOM Supp to AFMAN 31-108 would typically be considered surety related
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                             79


   and categorized in the Security MGA. The IG Team Chief will make the final determination
   of whether a deficiency is surety or non-surety.
6.9. NSI Inspector Surety Tenets.
   6.9.1. Inspectors will use applicable instructions, technical orders (T.O.), etc. as the
   inspection standard for the documentation, operation, process, and procedure observed or
   otherwise inspected.     Absent direct observation, authoritative documentation (e.g.,
   maintenance logs) takes precedent. The IG Team Chief bases conclusions on facts collected
   through direct observation (e.g., commission or omission of an act during a technical
   operation) or authoritative documents. Inspectors may consider testimonial inputs, but
   assertions usually do not carry the same weight as direct observation or documentary
   evidence.
   6.9.2. No NSI compliance credit will be given after inspector intervention. Inspectors will
   intervene to ensure safety, security, and reliability of WR. When inspector intervention
   drives eventual unit compliance, the inspected unit does not earn credit for compliance for
   the purposes of the NSI.
   6.9.3. When determining the impact severity of missed tests/inspections, the IG Team Chief
   will consult with SMEs to determine the reliability impact of a specific omitted/improper
   test/inspection.
   6.9.4. IGs cannot postulate that a follow-on test(s) and inspection(s) will be accomplished or
   identify possible malfunction. IG recognizes there are follow-on tests and inspections that
   have a very high probability of detecting possible malfunctions that went undetected by the
   omitted test and inspection. However, designed-in redundancy must be weighed against
   CJSCI 3263.05, C-2.c. Regardless if all follow-on tests and inspections are accomplished as
   required, IGs should not postulate the inevitability that such future tests and inspections
   would identify any malfunctions induced by defects that the omitted test and inspection is
   designed to uncover.
6.10. DOD NSI MGAs. This Instruction does not replicate the information contained in CJCSI
3263.05. The criteria below add AF-specific inspection specifications and requirements to
existing DOD criteria:
   6.10.1. Management and Administration.
      6.10.1.1. Management. Evaluate leadership, guidance, communication, and attitude of
      unit commander and key supervisors. When assessing management, consider whether
      deficiencies are the result of individual error or reflect management or supervi sory
      training/experience gaps.
      6.10.1.2. Administration.
          6.10.1.2.1. Evaluate weapons loading and management to include loading
          standardization, certification, training programs and schedules. For non-US delivery
          aircraft, evaluate status, certification procedures and records.
          6.10.1.2.2. Reentry system mating management to include standardization, training
          and certification programs, and maintenance plans as required.
80                                                 AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


           6.10.1.2.3. Status of approved security or safety waivers, exemptions, deviations and
           exceptions.
           6.10.1.2.4. Munitions Control. Evaluate Munitions Control in the planning,
           coordinating, directing and controlling munitions/weapons activities IAW applicable
           AFIs.
           6.10.1.2.5. Munitions/Maintenance Plans and Scheduling. Evaluate IAW applicable
           AFIs.
           6.10.1.2.6. Evaluate the certification processes and documentation of unit
           certified/qualified personnel (e.g., aircrew and missile combat crew members)
           assigned to duties involving nuclear weapons. At a minimum, review the records of
           all personnel certified/qualified since the previous NSI. For INSIs, review a
           sufficient sample of records to achieve a 95% statistical confidence rate.
     6.10.2. Technical Operations.
        6.10.2.1. Evaluate each type of assigned weapon(s) or weapon system(s) units are tasked
        to support to assess safety, security, reliability and technical performance. These
        evaluations will be limited to those operations on which personnel are required to
        maintain certification and operations directed by CJCSI 3263.05. All record actions and
        reporting normally associated with the operation will be evaluated. MAJCOM inspectors
        will determine the scope and definitive start/stop of technical operations. In order to
        minimize the inspection footprint and mirror day-to-day unit operations, this inspection
        activity will evaluate unit certified teams performing NWTI-required technical operations
        with minimal QA and other unit leadership presence.
           6.10.2.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Inspectors may ask technicians to measure a defect to
           determine technicians' ability to properly determine defect size.
           6.10.2.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Evaluations will be limited to those operations on
           which personnel are required to maintain certification. All record actions and
           reporting normally associated with the operation will be evaluated.
        6.10.2.2. For all technical operations and/or task evaluations the MAJCOM inspectors
        will brief items in paragraphs 6.10.2.2.3.1 thru 6.10.2.2.3.7 to all personnel to be
        evaluated prior to the start of the evaluation. Units may be required to submit team
        assignment documents, duty rosters, unit committed munitions lists, maintenance
        capability letters, etc., to the MAJCOM/IG before team arrival to expedite team selection.
        Evaluate individual Career Field Education Training Plans, Training Business Area, Load
        Training and Certification Document (AF IMT Forms 2435), PRP status, and work shifts
        when making team selections (maintain team integrity to the maximum extent possible).
           6.10.2.2.1. Unit assessors, QA, and weapons standardization evaluators are also
           subject to evaluation. The MAJCOM/IG may task these personnel to perform an
           evaluation of a maintenance operation within their area of responsibility. MAJCOM
           inspectors will clearly identify technical operations and/or task evaluations that
           require QA participation and evaluation of the QA function.
           6.10.2.2.2. During evaluation of any nuclear-certified procedure, the MAJCOM
           inspectors are to inspect the performance of only those individuals/teams required by
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                            81


        the applicable T.O. or guiding instruction for the procedure. Intervention,
        participation or influence by any other personnel (e.g., QA, Unit Weapons Officer,
        unit leadership) may be cause to terminate the procedure if, in the judgment of the
        Inspector, the outside assistance calls into question the technical proficiency or
        knowledge of the individual/team under evaluation.
            6.10.2.2.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Inspectors will ask questions in such a manner as
            to not detract from the technical operation and will not inject physical problems
            during an evaluation involving war reserve weapons.
        6.10.2.2.3. As a minimum, the MAJCOM inspector task in-brief will include:
            6.10.2.2.3.1. Inspectors will stop an operation or task only after all reasonable
            opportunities to detect the deficient condition have passed or if conditions are
            detected that would jeopardize personnel or weapon safety, security, weapon
            system reliability, and/or cause equipment damage.
            6.10.2.2.3.2. All personnel who perform in process inspections (IPIs), or provide
            technical help IAW AFI 21-series guidance will be included in all evaluations.
            6.10.2.2.3.3. If required, QA or unit supervisors may observe the operation;
            however, inputs will be limited to preventing actual safety, security or reliability
            errors IAW paragraph 6.10.2.2.
            6.10.2.2.3.4. If an abnormal situation presents itself and it is not covered in
            technical data, consult with your supervision. The MAJCOM inspector will
            expect a full assessment of the nature of the problem and what actions are taken to
            correct or report the problem.
            6.10.2.2.3.5. MAJCOM inspectors may review all paperwork generated as a
            result of the technical operation or task evaluations.
            6.10.2.2.3.6. MAJCOM inspectors will approve all simulations and deviations
            prior to the start of the technical operation or task to include all previously
            complied with steps.
            6.10.2.2.3.7. MAJCOM inspectors are not on PRP, therefore, inspectors cannot
            be a part of a TWO-PERSON team. Inspectors will not intentionally violate the
            TWO-PERSON concept.
     6.10.2.3. Weapons Maintenance Technical Operations. Evaluate applicable technical
     operations designated in CJCSI 3263.05, for which the unit is tasked in their Maintenance
     Capability Letters and Unit Committed Munitions Lists (UCML). For comparable
     operations evaluate only one weapon system type. Certain operations listed individually
     may be combined for the purpose of inspection. Inspectors will approve the starting and
     stopping configuration before the operation. Inspectors must observe technical
     operations that clearly demonstrate the unit’s ability to perform its assigned nuclear
     mission. During weapons maintenance technical operations evaluate adherence to
     technical data, documentation, overall safety, security and reliability of observed
     operations, to include final assembly testing.
        6.10.2.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Although technical proficiency is the primary concern
        during these evaluations, individuals are not expected to exceed their normal
82                                              AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


        responsibilities. If a situation is encountered requiring outside assistance (e.g.,
        squadron and base supervisors, safety office, or higher headquarters staff), personnel
        can expect to seek this assistance through their normal channels.
        6.10.2.3.2. (Added-AFMC) Actions to report nuclear systems deficiencies, seek
        assistance, etc., become an integral part of the technical evaluation. This does not
        relieve the evaluated team from the requirement to be capable of determining clear-
        cut accept and reject conditions.
        6.10.2.3.3. (Added-AFMC) Evaluations will be limited to those operations on
        which personnel are required to maintain certification. All record actions and
        reporting normally associated with the operation will be evaluated.
        6.10.2.3.4. (Added-AFMC) At the NSI Team Chief’s and inspectors’ discretion,
        observing one task may satisfy similar operations and weapons systems. See CJCSI
        3623.05 and HQ AFMC/A4M Maintenance Capability Letter to determine specific
        tasks to be observed. HQ AFMC/IG will coordinate technical operation scenarios
        with the unit and HQ AFMC/A4MW prior to the inspection. Inspectors will evaluate
        the following types of operations:
            6.10.2.3.4.1. (Added-AFMC) Inspectors may evaluate transfer operations for
            each weapon type (typically, in or out-of-container or bolster, from or to out-of
            container or alternate container, etc.). Transfer operations may be conducted in
            conjunction with other technical operations.
            6.10.2.3.4.2. (Added-AFMC) Inspected Areas:
               6.10.2.3.4.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Training, qualifications, and certification
               records.
               6.10.2.3.4.2.2. (Added-AFMC) Operation preparation.
               6.10.2.3.4.2.3. (Added-AFMC) Supply usage and availability.
               6.10.2.3.4.2.4. (Added-AFMC) Hazardous-waste             and      mixed-waste
               management and disposal.
     6.10.2.4. Loading and Mating. For custodial units supporting non-US delivery
     organizations include the US technical load monitor and associated training activities.
        6.10.2.4.1. Aircraft Generation/Flightline Operations will be inspected IAW
        MAJCOM/CC direction during either an NSI or a NORI (for NORI see paragraph
        6.18.2.1).
            6.10.2.4.1.1. Aircraft Generation/Flightline Operations. MAJCOM IGs will
            evaluate a unit’s ability to conduct a complete weapons upload, from initial
            command post message tasking to weapons break-out through aircrew acceptance
            and applicable post-load procedures. Loading operation must encompass each
            type and upload position (internal and external), as weapon system applicable.
            Loading standardization crew/weapons standardization load crews/squadron load
            crews may be evaluated.
        6.10.2.4.2. Static Loading Operations. Evaluate ability to conduct weapons
        upload/download and applicable post-load procedures. Static loading operations must
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                            83


         encompass each type and upload position (internal and external), as weapon system
         applicable.      Loading standardization crew/weapons standardization load
         crews/squadron load crews may be evaluated. The environment in which static
         loading is conducted demonstrates technical proficiency and standardization of the
         weapons load crew training program. Units may simulate some aspects of security,
         entry control, approved explosive loading site plans, and/or other operations that
         cannot be reasonably conducted in a load training facility.
  6.10.3. Tools, Test, Tiedown and Handling Equipment.
     6.10.3.1. AF Registered Motor Vehicles and Vehicular Equipment. Evaluate vehicle
     management control, accountability and maintenance practices for ensuring nuclear-
     certified vehicles and vehicular equipment are maintained in a safe and serviceable
     condition. Evaluate vehicle operator/using organization’s ability to perform applicable
     operator’s maintenance and documentation require ments on nuclear-certified vehicles
     and vehicular equipment to ensure safe and serviceable condition. Evaluate unit operator
     training and certification program to ensure compliance with applicable guidance.
     6.10.3.2. Equipment. Evaluate unit equipment management to ensure only nuclear
     certified software, testers/cables and equipment is used in support of the nuclear mission.
     Evaluate equipment is being maintained in a serviceable condition, current equipment
     calibration dates and equipment limitations/restrictions are adhered to.
  6.10.4. Condition of the Stockpile.
     6.10.4.1. Sample Size. Examine at least fifty percent (50%) of the active/inactive coded
     assets and associated bolsters, containers, and records in igloo storage and at least
     twenty-five percent (25%) of active/inactive assets and associated bolsters, containers,
     and records in long term storage facilities and/or weapon storage vaults to ensure they are
     stored in accordance with weapons-specific T.O.s.
         6.10.4.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Units will provide each stockpile inspection team with
         a copy of the Location Inventory Listing (LIL). The listings will be used to verify
         location, part numbers, serial numbers, modification numbers, status, etc.
     6.10.4.2. Retirement Assets. Examine at least ten percent (10%) of weapons coded for
     retirement and associated records to ensure safe and secure storage in accordance with
     applicable explosive, nuclear safety and nuclear security criteria, weapons-specific T.O.s
     and retirement unit requirements contained in T.O. 11N-35-51, Department of Defense
     Nuclear Weapons Technical Inspection System.
     6.10.4.3. Ensure weapons are stored in a safe and reliable configuration and in
     accordance with applicable directives. (i.e., properly grounded, chocked, immobilized.)
     Ensure weapons have proper spacing, storage compatibility, and are within explosive and
     active material limits. If defects are discovered on weapons, components or equipment
     during stockpile walkthroughs, ensure evaluation against applicable technical publication,
     technical order, or instruction and ensure appropriate corrective actions are taken and
     documented. Ensure the weapons inspection record card information matches the
     asset/container markings (P/N, Drop Numbers, S/N, ALTs, etc) for all weapons;
     active/inactive and retired inspected.

        6.10.4.4. Containers shall not be opened for the purpose of inspection; however, when
        the state of the item or the condition or accuracy of records is suspect, the container shall
        be opened and a visual inspection of the item and record entries made, if required. The
        determination to open containers shall be made by the NWTI Chief Inspector.
        6.10.4.5. For assets with storage bags attached sample a number of bags to ensure all
        required items are located in the storage ba g and properly packaged and or sealed.
        Ensure the weapons inspection record card information matches the asset/container
        markings (P/N, Drop Numbers, S/N, ALTs, etc.) for all weapons; active/inactive and
        retired inspected.
     6.10.5. Storage and Maintenance Facilities.
        6.10.5.1. Evaluate roads in storage areas, between storage and loading or missile launch
        areas.
        6.10.5.2. Evaluate nuclear-certified hoists to ensure, at a minimum, hoists are
        serviceable, authorized, and have received mandatory load testing and/or safety related
        inspections.
        6.10.5.3. (Added-AFMC) General. If continued use of unit-identified substandard
        facilities, utilities, or movement routes is necessitated because of operational
        considerations or budget constraints, the situation will report as a major deficiency or
        limiting factor for action by the appropriate major command headquarters.

        6.10.6.1. Evaluate unit compliance with DOD S-5210.41M_ AFMAN 31-108 and other
        required security standards for protecting WR weapons and weapon systems. Security
        inspection sub-areas and inspection methodology are depicted in Attachment 6, Table
        A6.1. Performance-based criteria, where designated, will be the primary means of the
        inspection. Compliance with existing requirements will be assessed through random
        sampling, and where practical, in conjunction with exercise events and/or task
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                             85


     evaluations. Compliance with established requirements will be considered when
     determining the overall security area rating.
     6.10.6.2. MAJCOMs will supplement this section to ensure their specific operating
     environments and elements of the published Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Nuclear
     Security Threat Capabilities Assessment (NSTCA, 2005-2015) are addressed while
     ensuring safe exercise conditions to meet exercise objectives.
     6.10.6.3. Weapon Denial and Recapture Exercise Planning:
        6.10.6.3.1. MAJCOM/IGs, working with their staff functional counterparts and
        AFIA, will develop realistic nuclear weapon security exercise scenarios to determine
        a unit’s ability to meet the Nuclear Weapons Security Standards (NWSS). The
        MAJCOM/IG team will determine the exercise scenario and coordinate scenario with
        DTRA during DNSI planning.
        6.10.6.3.2. Risk Management and safety procedures will be used in planning and
        execution of security exercises at all levels of command. When exercises are
        collocated within operational areas, care will be exercised to avoid scenarios that
        could be interpreted as an actual hostile situation that might cause accidental injury or
        illness to personnel or jeopardize the security of nuclear resources.
        6.10.6.3.3. At IG discretion, exercise scenarios resulting in the opposing force
        (OPFOR) gaining access to simulated nuclear weapons may automatically trigger the
        recapture or recovery exercise, as applicable. Inspectors will ensure both the OPFOR
        and exercise controllers know the “adversary intentions” for the planned attack (e.g.,
        sabotage weapon, destruction, theft, etc.).
        6.10.6.3.4. All participants will apply appropriate Information Security (INFOSEC)
        and Operations Security (OPSEC) measures to safeguard exercise information,
        tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). Likewise, the results of NSIs security
        exercises, or other like inspections under the auspices of the IG, will be appropriately
        classified, rated, critiqued, and reported for cross-tell purposes within the nuclear
        community.
     6.10.6.4. OPFOR Planning. Exercise scenarios will portray an OPFOR that replicates
     adversaries identified in the published DIA NSTCA. Likewise, OPFOR capabilities will
     be matched as best as possible IAW this document to evaluate the unit’s integrated effort
     to meet the NWSS. Ensure distinct separation of exercise play area from real world
     mission areas using visual identification tools (safety vest/belts, exercise controllers),
     safety briefings for trusted agents and normal exercise Command and Control (C2)
     communication announcements. All OPFOR, exercise controllers, and IG trusted agents
     will be under the operational direction of the inspecting IG.
     6.10.6.5. Security Deviations. MAJCOM inspectors will review the number and types of
     MAJCOM-approved security deviations as well as assess the adequacy of and
     compliance with, associated compensatory measures.

        6.10.6.5.4. (Added-AFMC) Compilation of deviations.
     6.10.6.6. Performance-based Assessment Methodology. When measuring performance
     to determine whether a unit meets the NWSS, inspectors shall apply the following
     methodology during their observation:
        6.10.6.6.1. Observe and evaluate the integrated execution of security actions and
        responses (performance), and compliance with technical criteria, as applicable.
        Provide performance-based (Acceptable/Unacceptable) rates for exercises by
        factoring:
           6.10.6.6.1.1. The timeliness/quality/strength of security/support force responses.
           For example, did the unit meet the tenets of the NWSS (i.e., Deny access or
           regain custody?).
           6.10.6.6.1.2. Execution of applicable plans and TTPs. For example, did the unit
           make sufficient effort to immediately deny access or regain custody?
           6.10.6.6.1.3. Effect of active/passive defenses, deployed delay/denial systems,
           and other technology. For example, did the unit use available options to prevent
           the loss of/deny access to nuclear weapons to the adversary to include destruction
           of the weapon?
           6.10.6.6.1.4. Unit application of integrated base defense activities in the overall
           effort to meet the NWSS. For example, did the unit bring available resources to
           bear on the event (e.g., technology, TTPs, EOD, etc.)?
           6.10.6.6.1.5. (Added-AFMC) MUNS personnel performing as security force
           personnel are subject to evaluation in this rated area.
        6.10.6.6.2. Determine the effect (outcome) of executed security action(s) and
        response (performance), in conjunction with the impact of unit compliance with
        technical criteria and contribution of supporting security systems, as applicable, (see
        Attachment 6, Table A6.1) to determine if the NWSS was met. For example:
           6.10.6.6.2.1. Did the unit effectively execute applicable plans and employ
           sufficient forces in their effort to meet the NWSS?
           6.10.6.6.2.2. Was unit C2 effective?
           6.10.6.6.2.3. Did the unit up-channel information in sufficient detail and on time
           to appropriate HHQ agencies?
           6.10.6.6.2.4. Were unit TTPs and applied security technology effective in
           meeting the objective?
           6.10.6.6.2.5. Was unauthorized access denied or weapons custody regained?
        6.10.6.6.3. Modeling and Simulation. As available and applicable, the inspector may
        use computer modeling and simulation as a viable measuring tool for developing
        response force scenarios based on the published DIA NSTCA.
        6.10.6.6.4. (Added-AFMC) Physical security compliance.

        agencies and/or activities.
        6.11.3.2.3. The use of available Unit/installation resources to recover from an overt
        attack.
     6.11.3.3. Emergency Evacuation. (United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) Units
     only). Rate on an ACCEPTABLE or UNACCEPTABLE (a pass or fail rating) basis.
     Evaluate unit plans and procedures to evacuate assets IAW command directives. The
     unit, as tasked by HHQ, must demonstrate the ability to effectively and safely perform
     and report emergency evacuation operations in accordance with HHQ directives.
     6.11.3.4. Command Disablement. Rate on an ACCEPTABLE or UNACCEPTABLE (a
     pass or fail rating) basis. Evaluate the unit’s plans and procedures to meet the primary
     objective to render weapons tactically useless and for the removal, storage, and
     destruction of specified WR components according to HHQ directives. The unit must
     demonstrate the ability to effectively and safely perform and report, in accordance with
     HHQ directives, command disablement actions whether tasked by HHQ or to prevent the
     unauthorized use of WR weapons should hostile forces threaten to seize them. The IG
     inspection team will provide the necessary exercise injects that would prompt command
     disablement implementation. The scope of the task evaluation may range from the
     interview of individuals with the responsibility for conducting command disablement
     operations to demonstration of procedures using training munitions.
     6.11.3.4. (AFMC) Inspectors will report results (strengths, deficiencies,            and
     recommended improvement areas) in the Use Control Major Graded Area.
     6.11.3.5. Emergency Response. Rate on an ACCEPTABLE or UNACCEPTABLE (a
     pass or fail rating) basis. Evaluate the Unit/installation’s response to any emergency
     situation to determine how effectively base resources are used in areas where WR
     weapons or weapon systems may be located (e.g., in storage, in maintenance, in convoy).
     Use realistic scenarios that are based on the Local Nuclear Security Threat Capabilities
     Assessment. Emergency response exercise deficiencies, strengths and recommended
     improvement areas will be taken into account for participating parties when determining
     the adjectival ratings for their respective MGA(s). (i.e., Management & Administration
     for leadership guidance and communications; Safety for compliance with Weapon
     System Safety Rules, Nuclear Surety Program and Nuclear Weapons Intrinsic Radiation
     Safety Program/ALARA concepts; EOD for render safe procedures; and Security for
     applicable DoD and USAF supplemented security requirements). Note: WR weapons

        6.11.3.6. An UNACCEPTABLE rating will be awarded for the Emergency Exercise area
        when:
           6.11.3.6.1. Unit response forces do not meet DOD S-5210.41M_AFMAN 31-108
           timing criteria.
           6.11.3.6.2. Unit response forces do not conduct recapture operations as specified in
           DOD S-5210.41M_AFMAN 31-108, CJCSI 3261.01B, Recapture and Recovery of
           Nuclear Weapons, and CJCSI 3261.02A, Recapture and Recovery Response Force
           Guidance. An ACCEPTABLE grade will be based on either successful denial or
           effective and timely recapture/recovery of affected nuclear weapon(s). When initial
           denial fails and the unit is not capable of regaining custody in a timely manner, the
           overall unit rate will be UNACCEPTABLE. Failure of a unit to initially deny
           unauthorized access or subsequent loss of custody of nuclear weapons does not
           automatically result in a failing grade for exercises. In these cases, IGs must consider
           specific nuclear weapon type, site-specific physical delay/denial mechanisms, site
           topography, climate, location, and adversary objective, as well as the effort of the
           security/support force to disrupt/delay an adversary’s task and cause duress to the
           adversary as the exercise scenario plays out.
           6.11.3.6.3. Unit fails to re-establish adequate security and access control for a WR
           weapon or weapon system.
     6.11.4. Use Control. Evaluate Permissive Action Link/Code Management System,
     Command Disablement System, Positive Enable System and Active Protection System
     operations per CJCSI 3260.01C, Joint Policy Governing Positive Control Material and
     Devices, and other applicable HHQ directives.
        6.11.4.1. Award an UNACCEPTABLE rating when the unit’s failure to follow
        authorized procedures for receipt, storage, control, destruction and issue of sealed
        authenticators or class 3 code management system/weapon coding equipment results in:
        loss of positive inventory control, unauthorized destruction or unauthorized issue of
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                              95


      required materials; or incorrect codes/documents being positioned/installed in
      weapons/weapon control panels.
      6.11.4.2. (Added-AFMC) General: Observe one Permissive Action Link All Codes
      Recode operation, one Command Disablement System Re-code operation, and one
      Active Protection System (if applicable).
      6.11.4.3. (Added-AFMC) Functions to Inspect:
          6.11.4.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Supervision and management.
          6.11.4.3.2. (Added-AFMC) Technical operations.

          equipment.
          6.11.4.3.6. (Added-AFMC) Compliance with Verifiable Control Procedures.
6.12. Re-inspection of NSI/LNSI Deficient Areas.
   6.12.1. When the unit receives an overall UNSATISFACTORY rating, the deficient areas
   that caused or contributed to the overall UNSATISFACTORY rating must be re-inspected
   using one of the following methods, as determined by the Team Chief:
      6.12.1.1. Re-inspect Prior to Termination. The team chief may conduct an “on-the-spot”
      re-inspection prior to terminating the inspection. If the on-the-spot re-inspection
      indicates the deficiency is non-systemic and is sufficiently corrected to permit operations,
      a follow-up inspection is not required.
          6.12.1.1.1. The adjectival rating for the “on-the-spot” re-inspected area(s) will not
          exceed ACCEPTABLE. If all deficient areas are successfully re-inspected, the
          overall unit rating will be UNSATISFACTORY (Re-inspected to SATISFACTORY).
          6.12.1.1.2. Do not re-inspect prior to termination if the Team Chief deter mines on-
          the-spot re-inspection is inappropriate, or if:
             6.12.1.1.2.1. The failure is due to a systemic problem or a general lack of
             proficiency within the unit.
             6.12.1.1.2.2. Suspension of nuclear weapon operations is in the best interest of
             nuclear safety, security, or reliability.
      6.12.1.2. Re-inspect After Termination. In instances where re-inspection prior to
      termination is not appropriate as determined by the Team Chief or re-inspected area(s)
      are not sufficiently corrected, the MAJCOM/IG will schedule an LNSI re-inspection NLT
      90 days from termination of the NSI.
          6.12.1.2.1. LNSI Re-inspection Rating. If all deficient areas are successfully re-
          inspected, the overall unit rating for this LNSI will be RE-INSPECTED TO
          SATISFACTORY. Assigning MGA adjectival ratings will be at the discretion of the
          MAJCOM. Unless an MGA was inspected to the same level/depth of a full-scale
          NSI, adjectival ratings should be limited to ACCEPTABLE, MARGINAL or
 96                                                 AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


             UNACCEPTABLE. Document re-inspection results IAW Attachme nt 6 and
             forward to Table A6.2, Group 1 addressees.
6.13. Actions on Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Inspections.
      6.13.1. Throughout the conduct of DNSIs, the MAJCOM/IG team will meet with the DTRA
      team to discuss inspection activities and potential deficiencies.
      6.13.2. DNSI Reports. Units will coordinate replies to DTRA reports through their
      appropriate MAJCOM/IG and AFIA. Take corrective action based on the field report
      provided by the DTRA team at the time of the inspection.
         6.13.2.1. CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT deficiencies require a description of the OPR’s
         corrective action (to include primary and, if applicable, contributing root causes) and a
         discussion of those measures or procedures initiated to preclude their recurrence. Closure
         of deficiencies requires a memorandum from the inspected unit to the MAJCOM/IG
         detailing corrective actions taken, and certification that all corrective actions are
         complete. (For DNSI reports, use CJCSI 3263.05, Enclosure F deficiency codes).
         6.13.2.2. The MAJCOM CARS monitor will coordinate on the MAJCOM response(s)
         and forward to AFIA CARS monitor with MAJCOM/IG concurrence. Corrective action
         response(s) are required within 90 days of the DNSI report date. If the corrective action
         report is not closed within 90 days of the date of the report, the MAJCOM CARS monitor
         will provide AFIA an update every 30 days on open deficiencies until the report is closed.
         6.13.2.3. AFIA will review and forward corrective action reports to DTRA
         recommending closure of deficiencies, as applicable.
         6.13.2.4. When all deficiencies are corrected, AFIA will request DTRA close the
         inspection report. AFIA will forward DTRA closure acceptance to MAJCOM/IG and
         CARS monitor.
         6.13.2.5. Deficiencies Outside Inspected Unit’s Control. Deficiencies attributed to
         inspecting MAJCOM staff will be managed by the MAJCOM/IG using the same process
         as described in paragraph 2.16. For deficiencies outside the inspecting MAJCOM’s
         control, AFIA will monitor and request updates from the responsible agency and forward
         to DTRA with the MAJCOM/IG update.
      6.13.3. Defense Nuclear Surety Oversight Inspections (DNSOI).           MAJCOM/IGs will
      courtesy copy AFIA/OV of all responses to DTRA DNSOIs.
6.14. NSI Core Team.
      6.14.1. NSI Core Team Roles. (See paragraph 8.2.1). The NSI Core Team, when fully
      manned, has 22 certified NSI inspectors assigned. Core Team members will integrate with
      the MAJCOM/IG team for all NSIs creating a single inspection unit under the direction of
      the MAJCOM/IG Team Chief. When scheduling allows, NSI Core Team will have at least
      one representative for each MGA for which it is manned present at every NSI (e.g., Tech
      Ops, Security, Safety, PRP, NCOP, etc.); for INSIs and LNSIs, the Core Team make-up will
      be contingent upon the MGAs inspected.
      6.14.2. Planning. At least 30 calendar days prior to a scheduled inspection execution, the
      MAJCOM/IG Team and Core Team will begin collaboration on a draft Sequence of Events
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                               97


   (SOE). For no-notice or minimal-notice NSIs/LNSIs, a tentative SOE will be drafted 30 days
   prior and finalized with the inspected unit upon formal notification.
       6.14.2.1. Ensure the SOE includes all CJCSI 3263.05 and MAJCOM NSI requirements,
       inspector task assignment (area of responsibility), and any inspection-unique
       circumstances or requirements.
       6.14.2.2. At least 15 calendar days prior to inspection execution, the MAJCOM/IG Team
       and Core Team will review and approve the inspected unit simulations and deviations
       and provide DTRA a copy when required by CJCSI 3263.05.
6.15. AF NSI Oversight Team.
   6.15.1. AF NSI Oversight Team Roles and Responsibilities. (See paragraph 8.2.2).
   6.15.2. Interaction with the Inspection Authority. During the course of the inspection,
   MAJCOM/IGs will allow AF Oversight Team members to be present for all in-briefs and
   out-briefs (including executive sessions), daily IG meetings, deficiency validation sessions
   with the inspected unit, and any discussions/validations with MAJCOM FAMs or SMEs.
   Oversight inspectors will be afforded access to all exercise areas and technical operations
   where authorized by EAL. MAJCOM/IG Team Chiefs will immediately notify the Oversight
   Team Chief of any potential CRITICAL deficiencies.
   6.15.3. Planning. The AF NSI Oversight Team may request MAJCOMs provide an
   approved SOE prior to inspection execution (e.g., INSIs).
6.16. Adjudication. Third party adjudication will occur for all types of nuclear surety
inspections when differences exist between inspecting teams and oversight teams when such
differences will affect the final overall rating of the unit. An adjudicated decision on the unit’s
overall rating will be reached before out-briefing the unit. Adjudication efforts will consult, and
may solicit inputs/positions from, all applicable resources available, within the nuclear
enterprise. Adjudication decisions will be resolved at the lowest level possi ble. Either the
MAJCOM/IG Team Chief or the NSI Oversight Team Chief may enter an overall unit inspection
rating into Level 1 adjudication, if needed.
   6.16.1. Level 1 Adjudication. In the event the MAJCOM/IG Team and the NSI Oversight
   Team cannot agree on an overall inspection rating, the MAJCOM/IG and AFIA/CC will
   collectively adjudicate the overall rating decision and provide that decision to the
   MAJCOM/IG Team Chief. The MAJCOM report will reflect the overall rating stemming
   from this decision, but will neither include, nor disclose, elements of disagreement between
   the teams. The MAJCOM/IG or the AFIA/CC may enter an overall unit inspection rating
   into Level 2 adjudication, if needed.
   6.16.2. Level 2 Adjudication. If a Level 1 adjudication decision cannot be reached by the
   MAJCOM/IG and AFIA/CC, TIG will adjudicate an overall rating decision and provide that
   decision to the SECAF and MAJCOM/CC. The MAJCOM/CC will communicate TIG’s
   final overall rating to the MAJCOM/IG. The MAJCOM report will reflect the overall rating
   stemming from this decision, but will neither include, nor disclose, elements of disagreement.
   The AFIA Oversight report will include the details of the adjudication effort, to include the
   dissenting opinion(s).

      6.16.3. Based on TIG and A10 (NOB Secretariat) recommendation and SECAF/CSAF
      approval, adjudication insights may be included with other IG-related issues as agenda items
      at the NOB. All adjudication decisions decided below TIG will be included as agenda items
      at the next NSI process review.
      6.16.4. In all cases, the MAJCOM/CC will retain unit certification authority.
6.17. NSI Reports and Messages.
      6.17.1. Classification and Marking. Classify and mark all NSI, LNSI, and INSI reports and
      messages IAW CJCSI 3263.05, CG-W-5, Joint DOE/DOD Nuclear Weapons Classification
      Guide, TCG-WPMU-2, Joint DOE/DOD Topical Classification Guide for Weapon
      Production and Military Use, and Executive Order 13526, Classified National Security
      Information. (Reference paragraph 2.16.1.2)
      6.17.2. Inspection Commencement Messages. MAJCOM/IGs will send an inspection
      commencement message to all recipients in Table A6.2, Group 1 NLT 24 hours after IG
      team in-brief of the unit. Use Figures A6.1 and A6.2 as a template.
      6.17.3. Executive Summary. MAJCOM/IGs will send an executive summary to all
      recipients in Table A6.2, Group 1 within 5 days of IG team departure from inspected unit.
      Use Figure A6.2 as a template. An executive summary is not required if the MAJCOM/IG
      publishes and distributes the final report within the same 5 days.
      6.17.4. Formal Report. Document NSI, LNSI and INSI results in a report and distribute to
      all recipients in Table A6.2, Group 1 within 30 days of inspection outbrief of the unit.
      Distribute the report to agencies in Table A6.2, Group 2 as necessary. MAJCOM/IGs will
      ensure agencies not included in Groups 1 or 2 but identified as OPRs for corrective actions
      are included in the report distribution.      MAJCOM/IGs will annotate in their final
      MAJCOM/IG inspection report any associated DTRA inspection or AFIA oversight
      participation.
6.18. Nuclear Operational Readiness Inspection (NORI).
      6.18.1. Purpose. The NORI is a performance-based readiness evaluation of nuclear-tasked
      units which support tasked Combatant commanders and Joint Chief of Staff (JCS)-directed
      OPLANs. NORIs require units to demonstrate their operational capability of nuclear and
      nuclear-support in a time-constrained environment.
      6.18.2. NORI Frequency. MAJCOMs will conduct NORIs on units with nuclear delivery
      systems at intervals not to exceed 36 months, waiverable by MAJCOM/CC to 48 months.
      Nuclear support units will receive a NORI at intervals from 48 to 60 months. USAFE units
      will conform to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Strike Evaluation
      frequencies. MAJCOM/IGs will notify SAF/IG when a unit will exceed the inspection
      interval and will provide the anticipated inspection date(s).
         6.18.2.1. Aircraft Generation/Flightline Operations will be inspected IAW
         MAJCOM/CC direction during either an NSI or a NORI (See paragraph 6.10.2.4.1 for
         NSI.)    If inspected during a NORI, there is no separate grade for Aircraft
         Generation/Flightline Operations—the overall NORI grade is the Aircraft
         Generation/Flightline Operations grade.
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                            99


   6.18.3. NORI Rating Scale. Unit/installation overall performance, MGAs, and sub-areas
   will be rated using the five-tier rating system of Outstanding, Excellent, SATISFACTORY,
   Marginal, and UNSATISFACTORY. USAFE may award NORI credit for successful
   completion of the NATO Strike Evaluation (STRIKEVAL). To receive NORI credit from a
   STRIKEVAL, USAFE/IG must ensure specific events are observed by inspector personnel
   either augmenting the NATO team or specifically sent to observe the events.
   6.18.4. AF NORI MGAs. The focus of the NORI is force generation, employment, and
   reconstitution (as applicable). Surety and safety should be addressed in all applicable MGAs.
   All NORI MGAs and sub-areas, to include Surety will be rated.

* Not applicable for AMC nuclear support units.

   6.18.5. NORI Planning. When possible for AD (and required for ARC nuclear support no-
   notice or minimal-notice), inspections should coincide with unit participation in COCOM or
   MAJCOM annual Field Training Exercises. The MAJCOM/IG will coordinate with
   applicable MAJCOM and/or NAF Exercise Programs, NAF-staff, United States Strategic
   Command (USSTRATCOM) exercise planners, and unit trusted agents in developing a
   realistic exercise scenario that fulfills inspection requirements. NORIs will execute to the
   DOC statement. Written waivers to deviate from DOC statement will be submitted to the
   MAJCOM/IG.
       6.18.5.1. The NORI may be scheduled in conjunction or in sequence with a UEI or NSI.
       6.18.5.2. If sequential inspections are conducted to assess nuclear surety, conventional
       readiness, and/or nuclear readiness, inspection objectives and criteria must be clearly
       delineated.
       6.18.5.3. If conducted sequentially, each inspection type will have an independent report.
6.19. Re-inspection of NORI Deficient Areas.
   6.19.1. When the unit receives an overall UNSATISFACTORY rating, the deficient areas
   that caused or contributed to the UNSATISFACTORY rating must be re-inspected using one
   of the following methods, as determined by the Team Chief (See paragraph 6.3 for guidance
   concerning unit deficiencies and continued nuclear certification status, if applicable):
       6.19.1.1. Re-inspect Prior to Termination. The team chief may conduct an “on-the-spot”
       re-inspection prior to terminating the inspection. If the on-the-spot re-inspection
       indicates the deficiency is non-systemic and is sufficiently corrected to permit operations,
       a follow-up inspection is not required.
 102                                               AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


          6.19.1.1.1. The adjectival rating for the “on-the-spot” re-inspected area(s) will not
          exceed SATISFACTORY. If all deficient areas are successfully re-inspected, the
          overall unit rating will be UNSATISFACTORY (Re-inspected to SATISFACTORY).
          6.19.1.1.2. Do not re-inspect prior to termination if the Team Chief determines on-
          the-spot re-inspection is inappropriate, or if:
              6.19.1.1.2.1. The failure is due to a systemic problem or a general lack of
              proficiency within the unit.
              6.19.1.1.2.2. Suspension of nuclear weapon operations is in the best interest of
              nuclear safety, security, or reliability. If necessary, reference paragraph 6.3, for
              decertification guidance.
       6.19.1.2. Re-inspect After Termination. In instances where re-inspection prior to
       termination is not appropriate as determined by the Team Chief or re-inspected area(s)
       are not sufficiently corrected, MAJCOM/CCs will establish re-inspection timelines to
       ensure deficiencies are resolved and unit readiness to support National war plans is
       verified as soon as practical but NLT 90 days from termination of the inspection.
          6.19.1.2.1. If all deficient areas are successfully re-inspected, the overall unit rating
          will be RE-INSPECTED TO SATISFACTORY. Adjectival ratings will not be
          assigned.

                                          Chapter 7

                               JOINT BASE INSPECTIONS

7.1. Purpose. This chapter provides general guidance for conducting inspections at a Joint Base
(JB) where the AF is either the supporting or the supported Component. MAJCOM supplements
to this publication will include MAJCOM-specific guidance for JB inspections within their
command.
7.2. Background.
   7.2.1. The 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) law established 12 JBs and
   simultaneously directed the relocation of installation support functions from one Service to
   another. At some locations, the installation support is provided by other Services and the AF
   is the Supported Component. At other locations, the AF provides installation support and is
   the Supporting Component. These two variations create different approaches to inspections.
   7.2.2. A key enabler to the success of Joint Basing is the establishment of DOD-wide
   standards for delivery and common definitions of services. DOD has developed JB Common
   Output Level Standards (JB-COLS) for Joint Basing implementation. These JB-COLS
   provide common output or performance level standards for installation support, establishing
   minimum functional support requirements, regardless of which Service provides the
   installation support.
   7.2.3. This chapter outlines an effective way to conduct Service-required inspections while
   keeping Service-level readiness and compliance considerations intact. Ultimately, any
   inspection process, regardless of which Service provides installation support, must ensure
   unit and command responsibilities are met in the context of the newly established, fully
   operationally capable JB structures.
7.3. Definitions.
   7.3.1. The “Supporting Component” is the component identified as having installation
   support functions transferred to them from one or more supported components. The
   Supporting Component is responsible for providing installation support for the entire JB. For
   JBs with the AF serving as the lead service, all Active and Reserve AF units on the JB are
   considered part of the Supporting Component.
   7.3.2. The “Supported Component” is a component identified in BRAC 2005 as transferring
   installation support functions to another component at a JB. For JBs with the AF serving as
   the lead service, all Active and Reserve Army, Navy, Marine Corps and other non-AF DOD
   units on the JB are considered Supported Components. On non-AF led JBs, all AF units
   residing on the installation are considered part of the Supported Component, Active or
   Reserve.
   7.3.3. A “Tenant” is defined as all DOD agencies/activities, Guard units and all non-DOD
   entities on a JB. Working Capital Fund units not performing installation management
   functions are also classified as tenants.
   7.3.4. “Installation Support” is any of the twelve categories of services and support
   activities. These are identified in the Cost Performance Visibility Framework (CPVF)
104                                              AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


  quarterly. JBs are resourced to provide installation support to the DOD developed JB-
  COLS performance standards. Examples include Command Support, Community Services,
  Emergency Management, Environmental, Facilities Investment, Facilities Operations,
  Housing, Human Resources Management, Information Technology Services Management,
  Logistics Services, Operational Mission Services and Security Services.
  7.3.5. JB-COLS are output or performance level standards established by the DOD for
  installation support using a common framework of definitions, outputs, output performance
  metrics, and cost drivers for each installation support function. These standards provide a
  description of the capability associated with the particular installation support function.
  These output levels will apply to all DOD Components, including DOD tenants, at JBs. A
  JB, through the Joint Management Oversight Structure (JMOS), can request a deviation from
  the output level. Only a senior-level DOD function, the Installations Capabilities Council, is
  authorized to approve deviations from JB-COLS.
  7.3.6. Joint Base Implementation Guidance (JBIG). The BRAC 2005 Joint Basing
  recommendations require detailed guidance to ensure that DOD implements
  recommendations in a way that expeditiously achieves the optimal level of long-term
  savings, while preserving or enhancing DOD’s warfighting capabilities. The JBIG, to
  include all supplemental guidance, directs DOD Components to implement joint basing
  under a common framework. It establishes the JMOS and confirms that all installation
  support will be transferred to the supporting Component to take full advantage of the
  efficiencies available from consolidation. Realizing the unique nature of our installations,
  the guidance establishes a governing framework to justify and approve variances to the
  guidance, ensures all Component equities are represented, and expeditiously resolves
  challenges to the fundamental improvement in the management of infrastructure resources.
  7.3.7. Memorandum Of Agreement (MOA), in terms of the JBIG, is the binding document
  for each JB that describes the organization structure, resourcing, output levels, dispute
  resolution and other agreements developed between the Components. Included in the MOA
  will be the JB Implementation Plan. The MOA, signed by the Component Vice-Chiefs of
  Staff, defines the relationships between Components, and commits the supporting
  Component to delivery of the approved output levels.
  7.3.8. Inspectors must be aware that other support agreements are possible at the local level
  and fall under the following categories:
      7.3.8.1. Intra-Service agreements are AF to AF, to include AFRC and ANG.
      7.3.8.2. Inter-service are AF to other DoD Components.
      7.3.8.3. Intra-governmental agreements are AF to other non-DOD Federal activities.
      7.3.8.4. Agreements supporting AF to other non-Federal activities, excluding private or
      commercial enterprises.
  7.3.9. The Supporting Component will ensure compliance with JBIG and MOA
  requirements. However, if a Supported Component is not satisfied with the installation
  support operations, either for personnel or equipment, the Supported Component may elect to
  improve resourcing to meet their particular mission needs at their own expense and after
  coordination with Supporting Component for bed-down support requirements.
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                           105


7.4. Command Relationships.
   7.4.1. Base Organization and Installation Support (IS).
      7.4.1.1. A standing JMOS ensures fairness for the JB process by providing oversight of
      MOA compliance, dispute resolution, and equitable allocation of funding requirements to
      the responsible entities. The JMOS then serves as a decision chain for JB-specific
      performance issues, and includes service installation management leaders and
      organizations at every echelon. A JB Partnership Council is the foundation of the JMOS
      with the following key roles: Review quarterly CPVF reports prior to submission to OSD
      and Service HQs and resolve IS delivery issues. It does not replicate routine JB decision
      processes or management functions.
      7.4.1.2. Air Base Wing (ABW)/Group or AF Element responsibilities are organize, train
      and equip functions, and apply to Airmen assigned to JBs. Organize responsibilities
      include Command Authorities IAW Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), DRRS,
      SORTS, AEF UTC Reporting Tool (ART), IMR Management, Backfill Management,
      and Military Personnel Management (Performance Reports/Decorations and
      Functional/Quarterly Awards). Train responsibilities include Expeditionary/Readiness
      Training and Force Development (Training, Education). Equip responsibilities include
      Deployment/DOC Statement Equipment and Readiness Training Equipment.
      7.4.1.3. The JB commander (JBC) has the authority and responsibility for effectively
      using available resources for planning, organizing, directing, coordinating, and
      controlling the delivery of installation support as detailed in the MOA. The JBC is
      synonymous with the AF term “installation commander,” and the JBC exercises the
      authority traditionally associated with the installation commander on non-JB AF
      installations. Consequently, the JBC is the commander who has authority and control
      over JB real property and is responsible for directing installation management and
      support functions IAW the MOA and the established JB-COLS requirement.
          7.4.1.3.1. There may be instances in which the JBC’s authority and the authority of
          other commanders on the installation are concurrent. All supporting component and
          supported commanders retain the inherent authority to provide for the health, morale
          and welfare of their assigned personnel and for the good order and discipline of their
          units. Commanders also retain UCMJ authority and administrative control over
          military personnel under their command (assigned Component), regardless of whether
          the military personnel are being operationally directed by the JBC. However, unlike
          other commanders on the installation, the authority of the JBC extends to the entire
          installation by virtue of his or her position as the installation commander. A list of
          authorities and responsibilities assumed by the JBC are set out in the MOA and in
          paragraph 4.1.4. of the DOD Supplemental Guidance for Implementing and
          Operating a Joint Base (as indicated, the list is illustrative and not exhaustive).
      7.4.1.4. Business Office (BO). Bos are part of some JB developmental solutions. As
      such, the BO consolidates responsibilities for agreement management, such as an Inter-
      Service Support Agreement. The BO does not have responsibility for any roles
      customarily assigned to a traditional AF Mission Support Groups or Weapon Storage
      Areas, but is the action office (or supporting office) for “other duties as assigned” that
 106                                                AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


       may include demographic data gathering, significant event calendar management,
       Economic Impact Assessment, and the Joint Land Use Study.
7.5. Inspections.
   7.5.1. Air Force IGs will inspect Airmen using AF inspection requirements whether the AF
   is the supporting or supported Service at the JB. When an AF supporting unit is providing
   service to an AF supported unit, the inspection standards stem from AF guidance. When an
   AF supporting unit is providing service to a supported unit from another service (Army,
   Navy, etc.), the inspection standards stem from JB COLs.
       7.5.1.1. CCIP. Air Force commanders on a JB will administer their CCIP in accordance
       with Chapter 5 of this Instruction. (T-1)
       7.5.1.2. JB Wing IGs will ensure MAJCOM Gatekeepers are kept apprised of Navy and
       Army inspection activities on the installation. Wing IGs will also ensure Navy and Army
       leadership at the JB are kept apprised of Air Force inspection activities at the installation.
       (T-3)
   7.5.2. Each JB has installation variances based on size, location, mission, etc., which make
   each inspection unique. Additionally, MOAs between services, organizations, and entities
   are fluid, complicating the IG’s inspection planning efforts. In order to execute the most
   effective JB inspections across the spectrum of functional disciplines, a thorough inspection
   planning process is required. ARC units located at JBs will be notified of regularly
   scheduled inspections with a minimum one year notice.
   7.5.3. At JB locations where the AF is the supporting component, the Emergency
   Management (EM) program will be inspected IAW Attachme nt 3 of this Instruction. At JB
   locations where another Service is the supporting component, the owning MAJCOM will
   develop specific criteria for the lead active duty unit IAW the unit’s role (if any) in the
   installation EM program.
   7.5.4. Inspection Rating. Fundamentally, the AF portion of the inspection remains
   unchanged—the IG will inspect any Airman, AF process, program or function. The IG will
   inspect and rate each distinct unit IAW the IG’s sampling strategy. For example, at JB
   Lewis-McChord, the 627th Air Base Group will receive a rating and the 62nd Airlift Wing
   will receive a separate and distinct rating. At JB McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JBMDL), the 87th
   Air Base Wing will receive a unique rating, as will the 305 th Air Mobility Wing, and the 621st
   Contingency Response Wing.
   7.5.5. Any non-AF issues uncovered during the inspection that affect AF unit compliance
   will be addressed in the report and passed to SAF/IGI for resolution. SAF/IGI will work
   with the other Service IG(s) and the Intermediate Command Summit (ICS) to resolve the
   issue. The final AF report may provide a comprehensive assessment on how the other
   Service’s installation support impacts the AF mission, but it will not deliver a rating to the
   other Services.
   7.5.6. IGs will comply with guidance contained in the JBIG and any MOAs affecting the
   inspected unit. When conflict between supporting and supported Services at the JB arise that
   cannot be resolved locally, the MAJCOM/IG will notify SAF/IGI, who will attempt to
   resolve the matter with Service counterparts.
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                             107


   7.5.7. When the Air Force is the supporting component at a JB, the Wing IG will ensure the
   supported component leadership is invited to participate in all appropriate local exercises
   (e.g., active shooter, natural disaster, etc.). (T-2) When the Air Force is the supported
   component, the Wing IG will ensure participation IAW Air Force JB leadership intent. (T-3)
7.6. Responsibilities.
   7.6.1. SAF/IGI.
       7.6.1.1. Deficiencies that negatively impact AF processes, equipment and/or personnel,
       but are not “owned” by the AF through delegation of installation support leadership, will
       be the responsibility of SAF/IGI for resolution once up-channeled by AFIA and the
       MAJCOM/IG Team Chief in the IG report.
   7.6.2. AFIA. Invite appropriate non-AF inspectors to the annual Gatekeeper scheduling
   conference. This will maximize calendar efficiencies for the JBs and provide a more
   positive, interactive and authoritative inspection.
       7.6.2.1. Coordinate with other Service IGs to establish a joint inspection schedule.
   7.6.3. MAJCOM/IG Team Chief.
       7.6.3.1. The Team Chief is responsible for final approval of the JB inspection plan.
       7.6.3.2. For deficiencies that negatively impact AF processes, equipment and/or
       personnel, but are not “owned” by the AF, the AF IG Team Chief annotates the issue(s)
       in the AF inspection report. Additionally, the Team Chief will debrief the issue(s) to
       senior AF leadership at the inspected unit, as well as the senior supporting component
       leadership at the inspected installation. The MAJCOM/IG Team Chief will then forward
       the issue requiring resolution to AFIA (this process is similar to a write-up against
       another HHQ). AFIA will work with SAF/IGI to resolve the issue.

                                          Chapter 8

       THE AIR FORCE INSPECTION AGENCY (AFIA) PROGRAM ELEMENTS

8.1. AFIA provides independent inspection, evaluation, and analysis to advance the
continuous improve ment of mission effectiveness at all AF levels. Its mission set includes:
NSIs, NSI Oversight, Mis and UEIs. Additionally, when directed, AFIA evaluates and reports on
high-impact, high-visibility programs that are of significant interest to SECAF, CSAF, or
SAF/IG. AFIA provides medical inspectors to support UEIs AF-wide.
8.2. NSI.
   8.2.1. AF NSI Core Team (AFIA/NI). A core team of certified NSI inspectors centralized at
   AFIA will integrate with the MAJCOM/IG Teams on all scheduled and no-notice NSIs used
   to operationally certify and verify nuclear-capable units. The Core Team will also support
   NSI re-inspections and select LNSIs and INSIs. See paragraph 6.14.
       8.2.1.1. The Core Team provides expertise across various nuclear surety MGAs as
       outlined in Chapter 6. The Core Team will support NSIs across the nuclear-capable
       MAJCOMs (AFGSC, AFMC, AMC and USAFE).
       8.2.1.2. The Core Team will combine with the MAJCOM/IG Team to form a single unit,
       under the direction of the MAJCOM/IG Team Chief. The MAJCOM/IG Team Chief
       retains the authority as the on-scene director and is responsible for determining the
       inspection grade and completing the inspection report to the MAJCOM/CC. The Core
       Team will provide the Deputy Team Chief.
       8.2.1.3. Primary objectives of the Core Team are to improve standardization of NSIs,
       elevate the MAJCOM/IG Team’s inspector experience and expertise and contribute to
       NSI lessons learned and trend analysis processes. Additionally, Core Team members will
       support the semi-annual NSI process review, the NSI inspector training and certification
       program, applicable conferences and meetings held throughout the nuclear enterprise,
       and/or duties assigned by AFIA/CC.
       8.2.1.4. The MAJCOM/IG Team Chief and the Deputy Team Chief from the Core Team
       are responsible for developing full team complement consisting of permanent party, Core
       Team members, and required SME augmentees.
   8.2.2. AF NSI Oversight Team (AFIA/OV). AFIA/OV provides oversight assessments to
   MAJCOM/CCs and TIG on the consistency of MAJCOM NSIs. In conjunction with
   AFIA/ET, conducts in-depth trend analysis, assesses the sufficiency of corrective actions to
   inspection deficiencies and provides deficiency status and metrics to personnel in the AF
   nuclear surety arena. See paragraph 6.15.
       8.2.2.1. The Oversight Team will not perform inspections but has the authority to
       intervene in an inspection for reasons of safety or critical non-compliance.
       8.2.2.2. AFIA acts as the AF clearinghouse for MAJCOM responses to DTRA Nuclear
       Weapon Technical Inspection deficiencies. AFIA/ET, in conjunction with AFIA/OV
       reviews CRITICAL and SIGNIFICANT nuclear surety deficiencies identified in DTRA
       inspection reports and requests clarification of deficiencies. AFIA also reviews
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                          109


     MAJCOM actions taken to correct these deficiencies and endorses them to DTRA. In
     cases where AFIA or DTRA non-concurs, AFIA returns corrective action responses to
     the MAJCOM for clarification.      AFIA will seek consultative assistance from
     AFSEC/SEW as needed.
     8.2.2.3. Provides nuclear surety-related oversight of MAJCOM-conducted NSIs, and
     select LNSIs and INSIs, to include re-inspections (all) and no-/minimal-notice NSIs and
     LNSIs. The AFIA/CC will be final authority on selection of LNSIs and INSIs.
     Additionally, provides observer(s) when the Defense Threat Reduction
     Agency/Committee on the Safety of Nuclear Installations (DTRA/CSNI) inspects AF
     units under the auspices of CJCSI 3263.05. AFIA will coordinate each NSI visit with the
     respective MAJCOM/IG Gatekeeper and will honor the IG trusted agent system to
     protect the minimum or no-notice aspect of the inspection. In the course of directly
     observing MAJCOM inspectors conducting their activities, AFIA/OV team members will
     not intervene in the inspection process unless the safety, security, or reliability of a
     weapon is in jeopardy, or injury to personnel, and the MAJCOM inspectors fail to take
     appropriate actions to correct the situation.
        8.2.2.3.1. Upon inspection conclusion, the AFIA Oversight Team Chief will provide
        a separate non-collaborative report, routed through AFIA/CC and TIG to SECAF,
        MAJCOM/CC and MAJCOM/IG. The report provides an assessment of the
        MAJCOM/IG team and their conduct of the inspection, and an independent
        perspective of the inspected unit’s nuclear surety. Specific areas to be addressed in
        each report include:
            8.2.2.3.1.1. Concurrence or non-concurrence with the MAJCOM/IG assessment
            of nuclear surety.
            8.2.2.3.1.2. Contentious issues (include areas requiring level 1 or 2 adjudication,
            reference paragraph 6.16).
            8.2.2.3.1.3. Composition of the qualification and training of MAJCOM
            inspection team.
            8.2.2.3.1.4. Use of current AF and MAJCOM checklists and inspection guides
            per paragraph 1.5.6.1.
            8.2.2.3.1.5. Implementation and understanding of policy and guidance.
            8.2.2.3.1.6. Adequacy of MAJCOM/IG validation.
            8.2.2.3.1.7. Sufficiency of MAJCOM/IG report.
            8.2.2.3.1.8. Sufficiency of MAJCOM/IG team’s deliberative process.
     8.2.2.4. Coordinates the proposed DTRA NSI inspection schedule for AF units.
     8.2.2.5. AFIA Inspection Observations. AFIA will observe MAJCOM/IG teams
     conducting inspections (all types) and provide feedback to the MAJCOM/IGs and
     SAF/IG. Feedback is derived from over-the-shoulder observation of inspection planning
     (when able) and execution, focusing on the quality, standardization, objectivity,
     thoroughness and conduct of the MAJCOM/IG team.
 110                                             AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


          8.2.2.5.1. Inspection observations will be administered by AFIA/OV and should be
          no-notice. AFIA/OV will selectively determine which inspections to observe with the
          goal of providing each MAJCOM/IG feedback across the spectrum of inspection
          activity over a 24-month period.
              8.2.2.5.1.1. Observation teams should have a minimal footprint and be
              nonintrusive into the MAJCOM inspection process unless safety or security is
              jeopardized.
              8.2.2.5.1.2. AFIA Oversight Team Chief will brief both the unit leadership and
              the MAJCOM/IG Team Chief of the AFIA role in the inspection process. Brief
              the MAJCOM/IG team prior to and the unit leadership during the inspection
              inbrief.
              8.2.2.5.1.3. AFIA Observation members should be present at the MAJCOM/IG’s
              daily team meeting/event recap unless actively observing MAJCOM/IG
              inspectors.
              8.2.2.5.1.4. AFIA Observation Team Chief (or representative) should be present
              at all MAJCOM/IG Team Chief briefings and meetings with the inspected unit’s
              commander.
              8.2.2.5.1.5. The MAJCOM/IG Team Chief will provide the AFIA Observation
              Team Chief a draft copy of their inspection report prior to the unit outbrief.
          8.2.2.5.2. AFIA/OV will provide an observation report for each observed inspection
          within 30 days of the inspection outbrief. The report will be approved by the
          AFIA/CC and provided to SAF/IG and the MAJCOM/IG. The report will provide
          feedback on the MAJCOM/IG team planning and performance in the conduct of the
          inspection. The report will not contain AFIA’s assessment of the inspected unit’s
          compliance with policy or readiness posture, but may comment on AFIA observations
          related to significant unit non-compliance with policy or readiness deficiencies that
          the MAJCOM/IG team does not identify or address.
8.3. DRU and FOA UEIs. AFIA/ID conducts UEIs of Air Force Direct Reporting Units and
Field Operating Agencies every 24-30 months IAW Chapters 1, 2 and 4.
   8.3.1. Inspection Scope. Inspected units may rely on host Unit support for management of
   some programs. Since the host Wing is subject to inspection by their own MAJCOM, AFIA
   will not inspect the host; however, AFIA will assess the adequacy of host Wing support to
   the inspected unit. On the other hand, if program support is provided by a FOA’s parent
   organization, the program management by the parent is subject to inspection by AFIA.
8.4. AFIA Medical Inspector Support to MAJCOM/IGs. AFIA/SG will provide a team of
IG-certified medical inspectors for the respective MAJCOM UEIs on wings with medical units.
MAJCOM IGs and AFIA will coordinate as required using the AF Inspection Scheduling
Process.
8.5. Active Duty (Active Duty) Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) Accreditation
Require ments. Active Duty (AD) MTFs must update their electronic application whenever
significant changes occur.
AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                           111


   8.5.1. AD bedded MTFs must update their electronic application upon notification from the
   Joint Commission (TJC), which occurs at 9, 18, and 27 month intervals from their
   anniversary date. TJC also requires an annual self-assessment, formerly Periodic
   Performance Review (PPR) via electronic submission, now titled Intracycle
   Monitoring/Focus Standard Assessment (ICM/FSA). Reminder notifications for ICM/FSA
   submission requirements are provided per email to the MTF/CC 15 months prior to the
   accreditation anniversary date and due dates are posted on the Connect site.
   8.5.2. AD non-bedded MTFs will be notified by the Association for Ambulatory Health Care
   (AAAHC) 180 Days prior to their accreditation survey. They must submit a new application
   which must be received no later than 90 days prior to their reaccreditation survey date.
   During the term of accreditation, AAAHC also requires written notification within 30 da ys of
   any significant organizational, operational or financial changes that can occur.
8.6. Field Inspection. As applicable, these inspections provide SAF/IG credible, independent
assessments of AF operational readiness, efficiency, discipline, morale, economy, and
effectiveness, as well as assist in oversight of the AF inspection system.
8.7. IG Team Augme ntation. On request, AFIA inspectors may augment MAJCOM/IG teams
during inspections of field units. AFIA augmentees do not write a separate report. Rated
inspectors with current medical and physiological training prerequisites may fly as observers in
unit aircraft when appropriate to their inspection role.
8.8. Contingencies and Combat. AFIA inspectors may deploy to forward locations and field
HQs during contingency and/or combat operations to observe processes and recommend
solutions to readiness problems beyond the control of the local AF field commander. These
visits require approval by the appropriate unified command. This is not an inspection, but is an
opportunity for an independent and impartial AF-level team to analyze systemic readiness
problems that may need HAF or higher-level attention. Refer also to War Mobilization Plan,
Volume 1, Annex O.
8.9. Directed Inspection (DI). This high-priority inspection will normally be executed by
AFIA and other SAF/IG personnel. If necessary, TIG may request assistance from
MAJCOM/IGs via their commanders to conduct this inspection. The DI is usually time-sensitive
and the deficiencies and recommendations are of significant interest to the AF, members of
Congress, or the general public. The MAJCOM/CC may direct his/her IG to perform a DI when
necessary, or may request AFIA’s assistance.
8.10. The AFIA Analysis Division. Will collect, monitor, analyze and report on key inspection
data from across the USAF and compile the data into meaningful information to support Air
Force Senior Leader decision making.
   8.10.1. Support SAF/IG with analysis for SECAF/CSAF level briefings.
   8.10.2. Provide AF-wide inspection analysis for Air Force Enterprise Dashboard.
   8.10.3. Collect Root Cause Analysis data from the MAJCOMs for analysis.
   8.10.4. Report on inspection trends to SAF/IG and other senior leaders across the Air Force.

   the resources required to support the upgrade and sustainment of each component.
   8.11.6. AFIA will act as the MICT MAJCOM Lead for all FOAs, DRUs and Named
   Agencies.
8.12. TIG Brief. AFIA publishes TIG Brief (Air Force Recurring Publication [AFRP] 90-1)
which provides authoritative guidance and information to CCs, IGs, inspectors, and AF
supervisors and leaders at all levels of command. Anyone may submit articles to AFIA/ET.
Articles should relate to anticipated or actual problems, recommendations to improve
management, safety, security, inspection or operational techniques, cross tell of lessons learned,
best practices, or contemporary issues of interest to the AF. (TIG Brief Web site:

                   IG FORCE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT

9.1. Air Force Inspector General Duty. IG duty is a position of high public trust. Personnel
selected for an Air Force Inspector General assignment are functional experts selected from Air
Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) across the Air Force. They possess attributes of the highest
professional standards and moral character; demonstrate potential for future service and
continued promotion; and provide credibility for those Airmen, family members, and civilians
who seek IG assistance. In addition to these qualities, Airmen selected for IG service will:
   9.1.1. Have broad, contemporary Air Force assignment experience and background that
   reflects outstanding performance. NSI inspectors must have nuclear experience or experience
   applicable to current systems in their respective MAJCOM prior to assignment as an
   inspector. All nuclear munitions inspectors will have prior nuclear maintenance experi ence.
   (T-1)
   9.1.2. Display moral attributes and personal traits that demonstrate adherence to Air Force
   Core Values. (T-1)
   9.1.3. Be able to attain and hold a security clearance commensurate with the duties required
   as an IG inspector. (T-1)
   9.1.4. Have no record of civil conviction except for minor offenses. (T-1)
   9.1.5. Have no conviction by court-martial nor any general officer letters of reprimand in the
   official military personnel file. (T-1)
   9.1.6. Present good military bearing and appearance. (T-1)
   9.1.7. Wing IG (87GXX). Be an O-5/civilian equivalent or higher. (T-1) Appointing
   authorities are highly discouraged from selecting IGs lower than the rank of O-5/civilian
   equivalent. Only in extreme circumstances should an appointing authority select a non-field
   grade officer to lead the IG section. IG sections led by non-field grade officers or enlisted
   IGs are not perceived by complainants or inspectees to have the same ability as field grade
   officers to: 1) address command issues such as command climates, abusive/hostile
   environments or other misconduct by leadership in the unit; or 2) inspect and report on the
   full spectrum of unit effectiveness.
       9.1.7.1. (Added-AFMC) Center IG (87GXX). Be an O-6/civilian equivalent (GS-15)
       or higher waiverable to an O-5/civilian equivalent (GS-14) with AFMC/CC approval.
   9.1.8. Wing Director of Complaints Resolution (87QXX) and Wing Director of Inspections
   (87IXX) will be an O-4/civilian equivalent or higher. (T-1)
   9.1.9. Wing Inspections Superintendent (8IXXX). Be an E-9 to E-8 or civilian equivalent.
   Wing/CC may waive this requirement on a case-by-case basis if qualified candidates are not
   available to the rank of E-7. (T-3)

     by the MAJCOM Safety, Surgeon or Civil Engineering office respectively in addition to
     the above AFSC and training requirements.
     9.4.4.3. PMEL inspectors should be qualified in their respective areas of expertise. An
     AFMETCAL IG-certified inspector (AFLCMC/WNMQ) will be considered qualified in
     their respective areas. PMELs will be inspected by an AFMETCAL inspector who also
     has completed ISO 17025 Lead Auditor and Root Cause Analysis Training or has over
     two years’ experience in performing and/or managing a PMEL Quality Program. If
     MAJCOM personnel are used to support an inspection they should be familiar with
     PMEL operations and satisfy as many of the training and/or experience requirements
     listed for AFMETCAL inspector qualification as possible.
     9.4.4.4. Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) inspectors should be qualified in their area of
     expertise and the weapons systems in which they will be evaluating. Additionally, AFE
     inspectors should have Special Experience Identifier (SEI) codes 122 and 125 (SEI 123
     and 124 are also desirable). All parachute maintenance, inspection, and repack facilities
     will only be inspected by qualified/certified AFE (1P0XX) personnel.

9.5. Inspector General Certification. See paragraph 2.5.1 and its sub-paragraphs.

Figure 9.1. Oath for Personnel Assigned to or Augmenting the IG.
9.6. Civilian Inspector General Require ments. In accordance with civilian personnel rules
and regulations, commanders or command IGs ma y hire Air Force civilians to serve as IG
personnel. Hiring authorities must ensure that these employees, like their uniformed
counterparts, understand the nature of IG work. MAJCOM/IGs must understand that civilian
employees who perform IG duties have access to sensitive and confidential IG information and
hold a position of high public trust. To protect those who seek assistance from the IG and to
safeguard the integrity of the IG system, civilian employees performing IG duties must display
moral attributes and personal traits that demonstrate adherence to Air Force Core Values.
Comply with paragraph 2.5.5 when considering utilizing bargaining unit employees for IG
duty.
   9.6.1. During the hiring process, hiring authorities will screen potential civilian employee
   candidates, to include current IGs applying for another IG position. These elements will be
   incorporated into hiring announcements and civilian position descriptions. Failure to
   maintain attributes in paragraphs 9.6.2.4., 9.6.2.5. and 9.6.2.6 below will serve as grounds
   for revocation of IG certification, credentials, and possibly termination from government
   service.
   9.6.2. Civilians selected for Inspector General Inspections duty will:
       9.6.2.1. Be a citizen of the United States. (T-1)
       9.6.2.2. Be in the grade of GS–11 or above. Team Chiefs will be in the grade of GS-13
       or above. (T-1)
       9.6.2.3. Have broad, contemporary Air Force experience and background that reflects
       outstanding performance. Civilian NSI inspectors must have prior nuclear experience.
       Civilians inspecting technical operations will also be required to have a nuclear munitions
       background. This experience is crucial to gain and maintain credibility with Airmen and
       civilians when conducting IG functions. (T-1)
       9.6.2.4. Display moral attributes and personal traits that demonstrate adherence to Air
       Force Core Values. (T-1)
       9.6.2.5. Be able to attain and hold a security clearance commensurate with the duties
       required as an IG inspector. (T-1)

A3.1. Inspection Require ments. Table A3.1., Air Force Inspection Requirements, contains
inspection requirements that, according to the HAF Functionals, indicate the areas of highest risk
where undetected non-compliance puts Airmen, the commander, the Service or our nation at
significant risk. Items marked with an “X” in the column labeled “Mandatory” will be inspected
during the UEI cycle. Additionally, the Wing IG will ensure that those items labeled “(By Law)”
will be inspected annually, either by the Wing Inspection Team, or by the MAJCOM/IG team.
(T-0) Other items in Table A3.1. should be sampled by the MAJCOM/IG to ensure confidence
in the Wing’s CCIP. All items in this table should be inspected during the 2-year UEI period (48-
60 months for ANG). HAF Functionals may submit changes to Table A3.1. by utilizing the
AFIS Governance Process (paragraph 2.22.).

A6.4. AF NUCLEAR WEAPON SECURITY INSPECTION GUIDE
   A6.4.1. Utilization. The inspection areas and items in this guide identify minimum-security
   standards and capabilities outlined in DOD S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108. When assessing
   whether a unit complies with applicable technical criteria, inspectors use this guide to
   identify areas/items to conduct performance test(s), compliance validation, or security
   exercises. Inspectors also use this guide during security exercises to assess how applicable
   areas/items contribute to a unit’s ability to meet the NWSS and provide effective response to
   emergencies. Inspectors will use the published Integrated Base Defense Security System
   (IBDSS) Capability Development Document (CDD) to inspect applicable technology listed
   in this guide.

              -HF10 Skill-based errors—flawed execution of task/procedure which has been
              highly learned and requires little conscious thought to perform. Most commonly
              caused by lapses of attention/memory or the use of techniques which are usually
              unnoticed, but caused an unacceptable performance (e.g., inadvertent operation,
              procedural error, checklist error).

              -HF11 Judgment/Decision making errors—have the necessary skills, experience
              and training but make a cognitive error resulting from inappropriate planning or
              choice (e.g., ignored caution/warning, inappropriate decision-making during
              operations).

              -HF12 Intentional violations—willful non-compliance with the known rules or
              standards (e.g., common practice or "everyone does," lack of discipline).

        WOUNDED, ILL, AND INJURED (WII) INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS

A8.1. Background. Congress, as part of the FY08 National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA), requires Inspectors General to inspect government-provided facilities that house
patients on medical hold. Section 1662, Access of Recovering Service Members to Adequate
Outpatient Residential Facilities, outlines the requirement for inspecting and reporting. In
September 2007, DOD issued standards for inspection of facilities for outpatient service
members. To ensure compliance with DOD standards, inspectors will use the checklist at the
end of this Attachment when performing the WII inspection. (T-0)
A8.2. Notification of Inspection Require ment: AFIA will receive a monthly listing of
recovering Air Force Wounded Warriors (AFW2) from AFPC’s Wounded Warrior Care
Division; AFIA will update the AFW2 list on the AFW2 SharePoint site within 5 duty days.
Upon completion of the monthly update, a notification message will be sent to SAF/IGI and each
appointed MAJCOM IG AFW2 POC. MAJCOM/IG will validate inspection requirements of
each AFW2 within their command NLT 10 duty days from notification from AFIA. Validation
must include contacting the member’s Recovery Care Coordinator (RCC) for validation of
member’s status in the program and their government provided residence.
A8.3. Pre-Occupancy Inspection. In addition to the scheduled WII inspection, MAJCOM/IGs
will instruct the Wounded Warrior’s commander to perform a pre-occupancy inspection of the
residence, to take place before the recovering Wounded Warrior takes occupancy (or as soon as
possible if notification is not timely enough to allow an inspection before the Wounded Warrior
physically occupies the government-owned housing). Additional personnel deemed necessary
shall accompany the commander on the pre-occupancy inspection (the individual's commander,
Wing IG, first sergeant, CE commander, housing/dorm manager, and local medical RCC). (T-1)
The goal is to ensure the individual's medical and housing needs are being met. The commander
is ultimately responsible for ensuring appropriate steps are taken to meet the member’s needs.
Submit a copy of the completed checklist and all documentation addressing deficiencies to the
IG Team Chief upon their arrival for the follow-up inspection. (T-1)
A8.4. Inspection Process. IG Teams will conduct AFW2 residence inspections using
inspection criteria outlined in Table A8.1. (T-0) The initial and annual WII inspections will be
scheduled and documented in IGEMS. All deficiencies will be identified and tracked to closure
within IGEMS. (T-1). For those AFW2’s not requiring quarters modification, paragraph A8.6
still applies. Once an inspection has been scheduled by the MAJCOM/IG, an inspection
notification memo will be sent to the Installation Commander, Wing (or equivalent) Commander
(if different than the Installation Commander) and AFIA.
   A8.4.1. Delegation Authority. In order to accomplish inspections in a timely manner,
   MAJCOM IGs may delegate inspection authority to the host installation wing commander. If
   delegated, the host wing commander will direct his/her wing IG to perform the initial and
   subsequent (recurring, annual) inspections of a Wounded Warrior’s residence as defined in
   this attachment as part of the CCIP. (T-3) In instances of inter-MAJCOM reciprocity
   inspection requests, the Wounded Warrior’s MAJCOM IG should coordinate with the host
   installation’s MAJCOM IG to request the aforementioned delegation of inspection authority.
   Inspection results will be forwarded to the MAJCOM IG not later than 3 days following the
 244                                               AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


   inspection. (T-2) MAJCOMs, in-turn, will follow report processes as defined in paragraph
   A8.8.
   A8.4.2. Frequency. IG-led inspection requirements include an initial inspection NLT 90
   days from validation and annually from the initial inspection date on the government-
   provided housing facility (on-base housing, dormitories and TLFs), for as long as the
   recovering Airman is in Wounded Warrior status and resides in government-provided
   housing. Commanders will re-inspect deficient residencies not less often than once every
   180 days until the deficiency is corrected. (T-1)
A8.5. Contracted and Privatized Housing Manage ment. If housing is privatized or managed
by contracted personnel, the MAJCOM/IG and the installation leadership will work with the
contractor to ensure the inspection takes place in a timely manner. Inspections will be performed
to the maximum extent permitted by the associated agreement. (T-1)
A8.6. Personal Interview. As part of the formal WII inspection, the Team Chief will interview
the recovering Airman one-on-one to get a sense of their overall care; this should be documented
in the report. (T-1) Family members at the Wounded Warrior’s request, are authorized and
encouraged to participate.
A8.7. Joint Base Housing Facility Inspections. It has been agreed that regardless of which
Service "owns/manages" the government-provided housing, Air Force inspectors will inspect
housing occupied by Airmen; Army inspectors will inspect housing occupied by Soldiers; Navy
inspectors will inspect housing occupied by Sailors and Marines. (T-1) There is no requirement
to inspect quarters already identified/certified as DOD compliant for recovering Wounded
Warriors (e.g., Fisher House, Malone House); however, the IG Team Chief will interview the
Wounded Warrior to ensure their needs are being met. (T-1) Although most Americans with
Disabilities Act compliant quarters meet DOD standards for the Wounded Warrior program, the
IG Team Chief will interview the Wounded Warrior to ensure the quarters are sufficient and that
their needs are being met. (T-1) This interview need not be conducted in-person.
A8.8. Final Report Disposition. Final reports will not include any PII to include member’s
name. The MAJCOM/IG will forward copies of the final report, with a cover letter identifying
the member by rank/name only, to the installation commander, the commander of the affiliated
Medical Treatment Facility and AFIA NLT 10 duty days from finalization of the report. AFIA
will consolidate all MAJCOM WII reports into a single Service report and disseminate in
accordance with FY08 NDAA, Section 1662 NLT 30 days prior to the OSD established closeout
date.
A8.9. Inspection Checklist: The inspection checklist (Table A8.1) incorporates requirements
set forth by DOD and is designed for a combination of interview, physical inspection and
documentation review. It should be executed at the location to be inspected with the patient,
case manager, and base housing facility representative present. The primary point of contact for
scheduling the inspection should be the case manager. When possible, the inspector should
either review applicable documents prior to the inspection or request the housing facility
representative to bring such documents with him/her to the inspection. Documentation may
include (but is not limited to) Pre-Occupancy Inspection checklist with associated documents,
pending work orders on the housing facility, work orders executed within the past six months,
asbestos documentation, lead paint documentation, pest control documentation & procedures,

       COMPLIANCE, or IN COMPLIANCE WITH COMMENTS.

   INSPECTIONS OF CEMETERIES LOCATED ON AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS

A9.1. The 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) mandates inspections of
cemeteries managed by the Services or located on military installations (see Table A9.1.).
Section 592 of the 2012 NDAA directs the following elements of inspection be assessed by the
Inspector General:
   A9.1.1. Adequacy of the        statutes, policies, and regulations governing the management,
   oversight, operations, and     interments or inurnments (or both) by the military cemeteries
   under the jurisdiction of      that military department and the adherence of such military
   cemeteries to such statutes,   policies, and regulations.
   A9.1.2. The system employed to fully account for and accurately identify the remains
   interred or inurned in such military cemeteries.
   A9.1.3. Contracts and contracting processes and oversight of those contracts and processes
   with regard to compliance with Department of Defense and military department guidelines.
   A9.1.4. History and adequacy of oversight conducted by the Secretary of the military
   department over such military cemeteries and the adequacy of corrective actions taken as a
   result of that oversight.
   A9.1.5. Statutory and policy guidance governing the authorization for the Secretary of the
   military department to operate such military cemeteries and an assessment of the budget and
   appropriations structure and history of such military cemeteries.
   A9.1.6. Other matters as the Inspector General considers to be appropriate.
A9.2. Inspection frequency. It is DOD’s intent that cemeteries receive an inspection on an
annual basis (every 24 months for ANG). To ensure this inspection frequency, the Air Force will
inspect according to the following construct:
   A9.2.1. The MAJCOM/IG will inspect an installation cemetery during their capstone, on-site
   inspection (as applicable; see Table A9.1.).
   A9.2.2. Wing IGs will conduct an inspection of the cemetery on their installation as part of
   the CCIP. (T-1) This inspection will be accomplished within 12 months (24 months for
   ANG) following the MAJCOM’s Capstone, on-site inspection.
A9.3. Reports should include any deficiencies, recommendations and corrective action plans.
All deficiencies will be identified and tracked to closure within IGEMS. (T-1) IGs will forward
copies of the final report to the installation commander and AFIA NLT 10 duty days after
inspection report is signed.

   A14.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Units will consolidate and submit a request for additional
   simulations and deviations not authorized by this attachment, exercise implementing
   instructions, inspection ground rules, or higher headquarters directives to HQ AFMC/IG
   prior to use. Do not request a simulation or deviation that is specifically covered or
   prohibited in higher headquarter guidance or technical publications. (T-2)
   A14.2.2. (Added-AFMC) Units will submit a request for simulations and deviations
   package to the IG following the format shown in Attachment 15. The senior official
   responsible for the local exercise program will endorse the package and will include an
   additional signature block for the HQ AFMC/IG Inspection Team Chief. Describe the item to
   be simulated, the reason the simulation is necessary, and how mission capability will be
   demonstrated. Send all wing/directorate simulations under a single cover letter via the
   appropriate Center. Forward requests to the HQ AFMC/IG IAW inspection notification
   memorandum. (T-2)
   A14.2.3. (Added-AFMC) The IG will approve or disapprove requests based on their
   descriptions of the resources required to actually carry out the action and the methods for
   demonstrating mission capability. The IG will notify the unit of the approval status of each
   request no later than 10 days prior to the inspection start date.
A14.3. (Added-AFMC) Newly Issued Policy. The unit may submit a deviation request when
an inspected unit is in receipt of newly issued policy or guidance and if at the time of inspection
it would be confusing, disruptive, or i mpossible to implement the new policy. The deviation
request should explain how the unit is implementing or planning to implement the new policy.
A14.4. (Added-AFMC) Pre-Approved Capstone Simulations and Deviations.

AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014                                                               283


   munitions will be cut from (CAS) balances. This will be simulated, or the CAS training data
   base will be used. For STAMP out loads, munitions will not be transported on civilian
   roadways. If the net explosive weight (NEW) limits of hot cargo pads are reached, other sited
   pads in the munitions areas will be used.
   A14.4.35. (Added-AFMC) If required during exercises, personnel will evacuate and place
   a cordon at a distance of at least 300 feet, versus the required real-world evacuation
   distances. This is to minimize any potential impact on real-world operations. All personnel
   evacuating and providing cordon support must be able to describe actual
   withdrawal/evacuation distances and locations pertaining to the task or operation involved.
   Both exercise and real world evacuation/ withdrawal locations will be briefed to inspectors.
   A14.4.36. (Added-AFMC) The IG will not approve simulation of the following actions:
      A14.4.36.1. (Added-AFMC) Processing only equipment needed for the exercise rather
      than the full UTC requirement.
      A14.4.36.2. (Added-AFMC) Marshaling and securing of classified files, technical
      orders, Readiness Spare Packages (RSP), and sensitive equipment.
      A14.4.36.3. (Added-AFMC) Marshaling of microfiche readers, enlargers, printers,
      computers, remotes, and facsimile machines.
      A14.4.36.4. (Added-AFMC) Marshaling             of    protective    masks,     filters,   and

      processing.
A14.5. (Added-AFMC) Pre-Approved NSI Simulations and Deviations.
   A14.5.1. (Added-AFMC) Inspected units will use type trainers to simulate War Reserve
   (WR) assets when WR assets are not already scheduled for authorized maintenance or are
   unauthorized/unavailable for exercise purposes. All trainers will be treated as WR. The
   inspected units will identify differences between trainers and WR to the inspector. This
   simulation also applies to the use of training equipment used with the trainer being used (e.g.,
   H1127). (T-2)
      A14.5.1.1. (Added-AFMC) While simulating a WR asset, training items may have
      markings unlike that of a WR asset. All training markings will be considered acceptable
      after being brought to the attention of the inspector. The inspected unit must explain
      differences in markings to the inspector to ensure technicians are knowledgeable of WR
      markings. (T-2)
      A14.5.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Many types of trainers have defects that have been
      previously identified and accepted for training use by higher authority. Inspected units
      will bring all defects to the attention of the inspector. For each defect, the team chief must
      brief and/or demonstrate the appropriate action to take if the defect was on a WR asset.
      (T-2)
284                                              AFI 90-201_AFMCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2014


  A14.5.2. (Added-AFMC) When simulating WR operations, technicians may document
  actions on a training Inspection Record Card (IRC) instead of the actual trainer IRC to
  prevent excessive markings. Technicians will have actual trainer IRC available, but may
  accomplish operation documentation training IRC. The training IRC must have all entries
  applicable to the operations being performed. Technicians may consult the actual IRC for
  discrepancies discovered. If the proper authority has previously accepted those discrepancies
  for use during training, the technician may continue the operation. Any item that needs to be
  documented on the actual trainer IRC will document during the inspection. (T-2)
  A14.5.3. (Added-AFMC) During technical operations, certain prior-to-use inspections may
  be performed before the inspector arrives in order to expedite the inspection process. This
  deviation applies only after consulting with the inspector evaluating the specific operation.
  Inspectors may request a sample demonstration of some prior-to-use activities to ensure
  proficiency.
  A14.5.4. (Added-AFMC) When WR maintenance is not due; units will use the H1616
  training container to simulate the actual container. Markings (including part number) unique
  to the training will be identified to the inspector and simulated for use as WR. (T-2)
  A14.5.5. (Added-AFMC) Units will demonstrate Permissive Action Link (PAL) operations
  using the T1564 PAL trainer when WR maintenance is not due. (T-2)
  A14.5.6. (Added-AFMC) During exercises and simulated technical operations, units will
  generate all required reports using the DIAMONDS training system when WR assets are not
  used (SCR, WSR, SCV, CAR, etc.). Training documentation will be generated within the
  required timeframes of real-world reports and will be provided to the inspector. WR assets
  and limited life component serial numbers and pack dates will simulate for reporting
  purposes. (T-2)
  A14.5.7. (Added-AFMC) During the Logistics Movement; units may use a vehicle to
  simulate an aircraft if no aircraft is available. Technicians must be able to talk through
  aircraft procedures and security forces must be able to demonstrate knowledge of aircraft
  contingency operations and security procedures. Units will demonstrate these procedures to
  the maximum extent possible using the simulated aircraft.
  A14.5.8. (Added-AFMC) During exercises, Security Forces will not employ violent
  measures or damage real world equipment to meet objectives. Personnel must be able to
  explain procedures for employment of measures and must be fully trained to accomplish the
  tasks. (T-2)
  A14.5.9. (Added-AFMC) Units will not operate fire extinguishers to demonstrate use
  during contingency exercise scenarios. Technicians must be able to talk through operation of
  fire extinguishers.
  A14.5.10. (Added-AFMC) During contingency exercises where radiological Personnel
  Protective Equipment must be worn, units may wear training gear. Technicians must be able
  to explain differences between training and actual gear. (T-2)
  A14.5.11. (Added-AFMC) During monitoring operations units may leave alpha probe
  cover installed. Technicians must tell inspectors exactly when and how the probe cover
  would be removed and replaced.

  A14.5.12. (Added-AFMC) Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) technicians may simulate
  the use of operational packaging material during EOD-operations. Technicians must show
  that all items are available and be able to demonstrate packaging on some items at the request
  of the inspector.
  A14.5.13. (Added-AFMC) EOD technicians may simulate the use of hydraulic fluid, liquid
  solder, grease, foam kits, and liquid safing fluids on EOD weapon trainers. Units must
  explain to the inspector the availability and proper use of required items.
  A14.5.14. (Added-AFMC) If required during exercises, personnel will evacuate and place
  a cordon at a distance of at least 300 feet, versus the required real-world evacuation
  distances. This is to minimize any potential impact on real-world operations. All personnel
  evacuating and providing cordon support must be able to describe actual
  withdrawal/evacuation distances and locations pertaining to the task or operation involved.
  Both exercise and real world evacuation/ withdrawal locations will brief to inspectors. (T-2)
