      training due to medical disqualification, emergency leave, security clearance or other
      administrative action, wartime operations impacting training availability or other reasons
      deemed valid and appropriate. Removal from training should only be considered when
      specific issues occur that would potentially impede or halt an individual’s training
      progression for a significant period of time. Trainees will not be removed from training
      queues to avoid exceeding training timelines.
   1.3.2. Qualification training progresses students from initial qualification through mission
   qualification and appropriate evaluations and/or certifications. There are three types of
   qualification training: IQT, MQT, and Specialized Training. Once an intelligence
   crewmember is trained and qualified via an initial mission evaluation, he or she achieves
   CMR status. Note: If there is no entry level position at unit for an Air Force Specialty Code
   (AFSC) and appropriate entry-level crew position IQT is unavailable, obtain Group CC-
   approved waiver for the individual to complete DGS 101 and local system training required
   for an entry-level crew position and then proceed to next tier position training.
      1.3.2.1. Initial Qualification Training (IQT). IQT provides the initial training necessary
      to qualify students for basic duties in the weapon system and initial crew position without
      regard to a specific unit mission. IQT is addressed in Chapter 2 of this instruction.
      1.3.2.2. Mission Qualification Training (MQT). MQT provides the training necessary to
      qualify personnel to perform tasks in support of AF DCGS assigned missions. AF DCGS
      personnel achieve Combat Mission Ready or Basic Mission Capable (BMC/CMR) status
      upon completion of a successful Initial Mission evaluation (INIT MSN). MQT is
      addressed in Chapter 3 of this instruction.
      1.3.2.3. Concurrent IQT/MQT. MQT should typically begin upon completion of IQT;
      however, when determined appropriate by the unit commander, intelligence personnel
      may begin MQT before completion of IQT, if training events and timelines make this
      option more practical. Member must complete IQT before fully completing MQT.
      1.3.2.4. Specialized Training. Specialized training is any skill necessary to carry out the
      unit’s assigned missions that are not required for every intelligence unit member. For AF
      DCGS units and for purposes of this instruction, specialized training outlines instructor
      and intelligence evaluator training requirements. Specialized training is addressed in
      Chapter 6 of this instruction.

1.4. Intelligence Personnel Status.
   1.4.1. Regression to Non-BMC/CMR (N-BMC/N-CMR). Once BMC/CMR status is
   awarded, failure to complete the required BMC/CMR CT and/or evaluation requirements will
   result in regression to N-BMC/N-CMR status. N-BMC/N-CMR personnel will accomplish
   required training and evaluation and be upgraded to BMC/CMR before performing
   operational duties.
   1.4.2. Proficiency Advance. Personnel may be accelerated through all standard qualification
   training requirements based on demonstrated proficiency or previous experience. The Unit
   Training Office will determine a training plan for students to move through qualification
   training while staying within policy guidelines.
   1.4.3. Remedial Training. Individuals who fail evaluations or do not maintain the required
   CT requirements will undergo remedial training. Remedial training will include the items
   identified as deficient in an evaluation or not completed during CT. Remedial training may
   culminate in an evaluation IAW AFI 14-202 Volume 2, as supplemented.
1.5. Training Folders and Reports.
   1.5.1. Units will document and maintain personnel training folders IAW AFI 36-2201 and
   AFI 14-202 Volume 1.
       1.5.1.1. (Added-480ISRW) Units will use AFISRA-approved AF Form 797, JQS to
       document progression and completion of crew position qualification training and
       associated certifications and use a TTL as a reference tool to further define training
       requirements. Use of AF Form 623a for training documentation is also mandatory;
       proper use and maintenance of AF Form 623a will be performed IAW AFI36-2201 Sect
       6.9.7.3. Units may develop local forms to track an individual’s training progression in
       addition to AF Form 623a entries that may be removed from training folder upon
       completion and awarding of crew position qualification and/or certification. Training
       folder documents will be placed in reverse chronological order with the most recent on
       top.
   1.5.2. AF DCGS FTU will forward formal school records to the gaining unit.
       1.5.2.1. (Added-480ISRW) FTU graduates receive a copy of their graduation
       certificate, AFISRA Form 401, Temporary Evaluation Certificate. AF Form 4350,
       Certificate of Intelligence Qualification is forwarded to the gaining Group Stan/Eval
       flight.
       1.5.2.2. (Added-480ISRW) A crew position IQT JQS will not be required in a
       member’s training folder UNLESS:
          1.5.2.2.1. (Added-480ISRW) An individual did NOT attend the FTU and requires
          in-unit IQT.
          1.5.2.2.2. (Added-480ISRW) An FTU graduate de-certifies on an IQT task and
          must be re-trained.
   1.5.3. Crewmembers departing Permanent Change of Station (PCS) or Permanent Change of
   Assignment (PCA) will hand-carry their AF DCGS training folder to the gaining unit if the
AFISRAI14-153V1_480ISRWSUP_I 16 OCTOBER                                                        17


   folder is unclassified. Classified training folders will be forwarded to the gaining unit via
   appropriate channels.
   1.5.4. Training Folder Requirements. The Unit Training Office is responsible for the
   disposition and management of AF DCGS crew position training folders. Training will
   ensure complete, accurate, and timely documentation of each training event.
   1.5.5. Electronic training folders will be maintained in accordance with AF/A2 direction.
   1.5.6. The Training Task List (TTL), captured on an AF Form 797, Job Qualification
   Standard Continuation/Command JQS prescribes tasks required for operation and
   employment of the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) AN/GSQ-272 SENTINEL
   weapon system and applies to all units training and certifying AF DCGS crewmembers.
   TTLs define training requirements for skill set development that support the operational
   duties necessary for each crew position. TTLs are the basis for creating syllabi and training
   programs that develop the required knowledge and skill sets necessary for weapon system
   employment. The TTL includes all tasks in each functional area requiring training, and will
   be used as a management tool for developing, performing and documenting training, as part
   of the overall Qualification Training Package (QTP) for each crew position or certification.
      1.5.6.1. (Added-480ISRW) AF Form 797/JQS is a required form that is used to
      document all weapon system certification and qualification training. The AF Form
      797/JQS contains overarching tasks specific to the associated certification or crew
      position which are required training for any member to attain certification/qualification.
      Each line item on the JQS consists of the task, the training reference which indicates
      where additional information regarding that task can be found, and training area that the
      task satisfies. Each task item on the AF Form 797/JQS must be signed off by an
      instructor certified/qualified in the certification/crew position which is being trained.
      1.5.6.2. (Added-480ISRW) AF Form 797/JQS will be used in conjunction with the
      certification/crew position master TTL when conducting training. Units are responsible
      for creating a local TTL for each certification or crew position by identifying which
      master TTL sub-paragraphs are applicable to that unit's mission and system capabilities
      and are required training for their members. Once the local TTL is created or updated a
      copy should be maintained by the unit operations training flight and made available to
      instructors for use when training. Members are not required to maintain a TTL in their
      training folder; TTLs should be used as a reference tool to further define training
      requirements. Once new TTL items are identified and circled, unit operations training
      flights must ensure dissemination of changes to instructors.
   1.5.7. The QTP is a set of instructional documents designed for use at the unit level to
   qualify/certify an individual. A QTP includes or provides references to all documents and
   materials necessary to successfully train personnel on a given crew position or certification.
   It is composed of training objectives, references, the Job Qualification Standard (JQS), TTL,
   study guide, and training syllabus.
1.6. Waivers. AFISRA/CC is the waiver authority for this publication, authority can be
delegated. Submit waivers through appropriate training channels to AFISRA/A3T. Copies will
be in message or memo format. Note: HQ AFRC and ANG unit waivers will be coordinated
with their respective A2 prior to submission to AFISRA.

                                           Chapter 2

                          INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General. This chapter outlines IQT for AF DCGS entry-level crew positions. IQT for
intelligence personnel begins after initial skills training is completed (i.e., the AFSC-awarding
courses) and will take place at the AETC AF DCGS FTU. Formal training and a successful INIT
QUAL meets the criteria for crewmembers to achieve Basic Qualification (BQ) status.
   2.1.1. (Added-480ISRW) When inbound or newly arrived individuals are identified by unit
   as requiring formal IQT, coordination with 480 ISR WG/DOT for course attendance at AF
   DCGS FTU must be conducted.
   2.1.2. (Added-480ISRW) Completing the appropriate formal IQT courses satisfies all unit
   IQT requirements.
2.2. Waivers. AFISRA will generate a waiver for in-unit IQT due to FTU non-availability for
Active Duty (AD) units. AFRC and NGB/A2 are the waiver authority for AFISRA-gained ARC
units and will forward all waiver requests regarding FTU waivers to AFISRA for review.
   2.2.1. (Added-480ISRW) When identified, 480 ISR WG AD units will submit FTU IQT
   by-pass nominees to 480 ISR WG/DOT to coordinate for AFISRA approval. During
   coordination with AFISRA for in-unit IQT/FTU by-pass, units will not delay start of IQT for
   new members if local training queues allow. If HHQ determines that FTU attendance is
   available and appropriate, member will attend in-residence AF DCGS FTU IQT course for
   appropriate crew position/AFSC.
   2.2.2. (Added-480ISRW) In-unit IQT/FTU waiver requests will be properly formatted and
   then coordinated through 480 ISR WG/DOT to the Wing Commander. Waiver requests will
   include:
       2.2.2.1. (Added-480ISRW) Name, rank, training crew position.
       2.2.2.2. (Added-480ISRW) Date of request by unit for reserved seat in current
       scheduled FTU class and subsequent determination that FTU class seat will not be
       immediately available.
       2.2.2.3. (Added-480ISRW) Justification for local training in lieu of formal course
       training.
       2.2.2.4. (Added-480ISRW) Date local training will begin and projected completion
       date.
       2.2.2.5. (Added-480ISRW) Requested exceptions to formal course syllabus with
       rationale, if any.
2.3. In-Unit IQT.
   2.3.1. Units are required to use AF DCGS FTU QTP.
   2.3.2. IQT Timeline. Students must complete in-unit IQT within the time limits specified in
   the QTP not to exceed 90 calendar days from IQT start date (120 calendar days for AFISRA-
   gained AFRC and ANG units). If training exceeds established time limits, the unit
AFISRAI14-153V1_480ISRWSUP_I 16 OCTOBER                                                      21


   commander is the waiver authority and may grant a 30-day extension. Units must notify
   appropriate channels with the individual student’s name, rank, mission position, reason for
   delay, and an action plan. If a second 30-day extension is necessary it must be approved by
   the Group Commander. If a third extension is necessary, it must be approved by the Wing
   Commander. Further extensions will require appropriate headquarters approval.
   2.3.3. Personnel in IQT will not perform crew mission duties without direct instructor
   supervision.
       2.3.3.1. (Added-480ISRW) IQT trainees may perform hands-on training on work
       stations/systems without one-to-one Instructor supervision when the systems are not
       being utilized for live mission. IQT trainees may observe qualified operators conducting
       live missions without direct supervision, but will not interrupt operators or manipulate
       workstations or systems being utilized.
   2.3.4. Personnel completing IQT will be evaluated IAW AF DCGS FTU standards for
   QUAL evaluation. Personnel attending in-unit IQT will be evaluated according to the same
   standards used by AF DCGS FTU for the end of course QUAL evaluation.
   2.3.5. Personnel approved to attend in-unit IQT will maintain a copy of the approved waiver
   and have their training performance documented in their training folder.
       2.3.5.1. (Added-480ISRW) All in-unit IQT will be documented on an appropriately
       annotated AF Form 623a and AF Form 797/JQS using AFISRA-approved TTLs as
       reference tools to define training requirements for each AF DCGS crew position. The
       797 and 623a forms will remain in the individual’s folder while assigned to an AF DCGS
       weapon system unit.
2.4. Refresher Training. For in-residence FTU graduates, unit commanders may authorize up
to 10 days for refresher training before the student is placed in MQT. Unit Training Office will
document the training in the individual’s training folder.
2.5. Formal Course Changes. Changes to IQT and QTP formal requirements can only be
made by AETC in coordination with AFISRA and will be determined at the TPT.

                          MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. General. MQT is training necessary to qualify intelligence personnel in an assigned
position to perform the unit mission. MQT execution will take into account the assigned crew
position, current qualifications, prior experience, currency, documented performance and/or
formal training achieved by each individual. MQT can be accomplished through internal
training sessions, external courses, or one-on-one instruction from a qualified instructor. At the
completion of MQT, applicable mission certifications, and a successful evaluation, individuals
are BMC/CMR for the applicable crew position. Applicable portions of MQT will be used to
create a re-qualification program for personnel who are in N-CMR or N-BMC status.
   3.1.1. Locally Developed Syllabi for MQT. When specific formal courseware is not
   published, units will forward locally developed syllabi for in-unit training through proper
   channels and forward to AFISRA for review, validation and approval prior to use in the field.
   Only AFISRA-approved syllabi are authorized for use in MQT.
   3.1.2. (Added-480ISRW) MQT, mission qualification evaluations, and special
   qualifications will be conducted in-unit following the completion of the formal course or in-
   unit IQT. MQT should be conducted during live missions; however, when situations warrant
   and live mission is not available, MQT may be conducted on mission workstations or in
   training labs with applicable systems to simulate live mission activity. Locally-developed
   training scenarios with defined objectives and anticipated responses may be used to
   supplement training once approved as outlined in AFISRAI 14-153V1 paragraph 3.1.1.
   3.1.3. (Added-480ISRW) Concurrent IQT/MQT. MQT should typically begin upon
   completion of IQT; however, in situations determined by the Senior Intelligence Officer,
   intelligence personnel may begin MQT before completion of IQT, if training events and
   timelines make this option more practical. Member must complete IQT before fully
   completing MQT. Refer to AFI 14-202V2, AFISRAI 14-153V2/AFI 14-2(DCGS)V2, as
   supplemented, for combined IQT/MQT evaluation criteria and procedures.
3.2. MQT Timelines. MQT will be completed within the time limits specified below.
   3.2.1. For individuals completing in-unit IQT, the first MQT training event must be
   completed within 45 calendar days from the completion of IQT (including AFISRA-gained
   ANG and AFRC units). If entry into MQT is delayed, the Unit Commander may grant a 30-
   day extension and must be notified with individual’s name, rank, mission position and reason
   for delay. If a second 30-extension is necessary it must be approved by the Group
   Commander. If a third extension is necessary, it must be approved by the Wing Commander.
   Further extensions will require appropriate headquarters approval.
   3.2.2. Students must complete MQT within the time limits delineated, not to exceed 90
   calendar days (180 days for AFISRA-gained AFRC and ANG units). If training exceeds the
   prescribed time limits, the Unit Commander must be notified with the individual’s name,
   rank, mission position and reason for delay. If a second extension is necessary it must be
   approved by the Group Commander.
AFISRAI14-153V1_480ISRWSUP_I 16 OCTOBER                                                       23


  3.2.3. Personnel in MQT may only perform primary crew position duties under the direct
  supervision of an instructor for that crew position. The instructor is responsible for all
  actions and intelligence data derived by the personnel in MQT under their supervision.
     3.2.3.1. (Added-480ISRW) MQT trainees may perform hands-on training on work
     stations/systems without direct supervision when the systems are not being utilized for
     live mission. MQT trainees may observe qualified operators conducting live missions
     without direct supervision, but will not interrupt operators or manipulate workstations or
     systems being utilized.
  3.2.4. Upgrade Training. Upgrade training provides MQT for Tier 1 and Tier 2 positions
  identified in Table A2.1
     3.2.4.1. Fast Track. Personnel identified by the unit commander with previous
     experience that directly translates to an AFISRA Mission Design Series (MDS), weapon
     system, intelligence function, or specific activity mission position can be placed into Fast
     Track status. Personnel placed into Fast Track status must complete IQT for an entry-
     level position and then must complete the MQT for Tier 1 upgrade mission position.
         3.2.4.1.1. (Added-480ISRW) Entry into fast track status must be based on previous
         experience performed within five years prior to arrival at gaining unit. Individuals
         with qualifying experience that expired in excess of the five year maximum period
         may not enter into fast track; all IQT and MQT qualification requirements for entry
         level crew position must be completed before consideration for Tier I upgrade
         training. Groups, Squadrons or detachments may issue additional guidance (i.e.
         operating instructions) as necessary.
     3.2.4.2. Crew position prerequisites and progression requirements are shown in Table
     A2.2.
     3.2.4.3. Unit Commanders should select only highly qualified, motivated, and
     responsible individuals for Upgrade Training.
     3.2.4.4. Upgrade Training Prerequisites. This establishes the minimum guidelines for
     those personnel identified to qualify for a Tier position.
         3.2.4.4.1. Be approved by the unit Director of Operations (DO).
         3.2.4.4.2. Currently hold the pre-requisite qualification or certification required for
         the upgrade position.

           4.1.1.3.3. (Added-480ISRW) Upon completion of initial cadre training, initial cadre
           personnel will be required to develop a certification training package in order to
           provide difference training to other crew members. There is a maximum of 120
AFISRAI14-153V1_480ISRWSUP_I 16 OCTOBER                                                         33


         calendar days allowed for initial cadre to develop tactics, processes, and training
         materials. The certification training package will include, at a minimum, position-
         specific training standards (797/TTL), study guides, performance evaluation criteria
         and materials (question banks and demonstrated performance checks). Completed
         certification training packages will be forwarded to 480 ISR WG/DOT for validation
         and approval before use. See AFISRAI 14-153V1 paragraphs 4.1.3.5 for Area of
         Responsibility (AOR) certifications.
         4.1.1.3.4. (Added-480ISRW) Once training materials are developed and validated,
         a timeline outlining completion of training at a unit should be identified; maximum
         time allowed to complete training will be 120 calendar days. Instructors should be
         the first group of individuals taught by the initial cadre to ensure that, upon expiration
         of the initial cadre designation, the unit has sufficient instructor manning to maintain
         and proliferate this new system, sensor, or upgrade. Initial cadre members must also
         complete and document difference training within the same training periods.
  4.1.2. Tabletop Certifications.
     4.1.2.1. Tabletop Certification is a tool available to Squadron/Detachment Commanders
     or their equivalents to expedite certification of crewmembers in a new mission area when
     there is insufficient time to certify via pre-existing methods.             Additionally,
     Squadron/Detachment Commanders or their equivalents may use Tabletop Certification
     to certify crewmembers on mission tasks that cannot be performed in a live-mission
     environment without adversely affecting safety or negatively impacting mission
     operations (e.g., CRITIC testing, emergency procedures, etc). The purpose of Tabletop
     Certification is to convey to the Commander that the crewmember(s) is/are prepared to
     perform the tasks safely and successfully.
         4.1.2.1.1. Tabletop Certification for a new mission area must include training and
         review of basic Area of Responsibility (AOR) information to include maps, major
         locations, OB, geographical features, and target weapon systems. Tabletop
         Certification for a mission task must include training, review and simulated execution
         of the mission task.
         4.1.2.1.2. Tabletop certifications will be documented in personnel training folders.
         4.1.2.1.3. Tabletop certifications expire after 120 days and must be replaced by
         formal certification methods if the mission continues.
  4.1.3. Certification Types. Certifications can include system upgrades or additions, AOR,
  mission specific functions, and are necessary supplements to certain weapon system
  qualifications. All certifications will be accomplished by completing open and/or closed-
  book written examinations and/or a positional/task performance ability assessment to the
  satisfaction of an instructor.
     4.1.3.1. Sensor certification.    Training conducted for changes to collection sensor
     capabilities.
     4.1.3.2. System certification.     Training conducted on changes to weapons system
     configurations.

     4.1.3.3. Mission Specific Certification.   Training conducted to meet unique mission
     support requirements.
         4.1.3.3.1. (Added-480ISRW) Mission specific (or “mission set”) certifications will
         be accomplished by completing an open or closed book written examination with a
         minimum passing score of 85% and a task certification by qualified instructor or task
         certifier, if required for performance items. Mission specific certifications must be
         re-accomplished at least every 17 months and re-accomplishment should be aligned
         with periodic crew position qualification evaluations.
         4.1.3.3.2. (Added-480ISRW) Failure to meet 85% on a mission specific
         certification or re-certification written examination will require a TRB to be convened
         IAW paragraph 1.2.6.9. of this instruction. Following TRB determination, a retest on
         deficient subject areas may not be administered earlier than 24 hours from failed
         examination. If retesting earlier than 24 hours from failed examination is necessary,
         unit commander may approve earlier retest on a case-by-case basis. Any additional
         training assigned to remedy deficiencies identified for a task performance item failure
         must be completed within 14 calendar days. Training may include, but is not limited
         to self-study, academic instruction, and simulated or live missions. Demonstration of
         satisfactory knowledge or proficiency to an instructor or task certifier is required to
         qualify as completed. Document retest scores and additional training accomplishment
         in training records.
         4.1.3.3.3. (Added-480ISRW) Restrictions. Individuals failing to complete all
         certification requirements will not perform duties or responsibilities assigned to
         certification until successful re-accomplishment of requirements. Failed certifications
         will not affect crew position qualification.
     4.1.3.4. Enterprise-wide Certifications will be determined at TPT working groups.
     4.1.3.5. AOR Certifications. Training conducted to meet AOR specific operational
     requirements. AOR certifications will be accomplished annually by completing an open-
     book test with a minimum passing score of 85%. Failure to meet 85% on an AOR
     recertification will require an instructor review of items missed and retest on deficient
     subject areas within 48 hours.
         4.1.3.5.1. 480 ISRW is responsible to ensure the production of AOR certification
         material to include study guides and test banks IAW the provisions of AFI 14-202
         Volume 1, Intelligence Training, as supplemented, and this instruction.
         4.1.3.5.2. 480 ISRW is responsible to review and update AOR materials annually.
         4.1.3.5.3. AFISRA retains oversight responsibility and is the final authority of all
         published AOR certification training materials.
     4.1.3.6. AOR and mission specific certification training may be performed
     simultaneously with MQT or upgrade training when appropriate.
  4.1.4. Multiple Certifications. Personnel may hold multiple certifications. Certification
  assessments may be combined during a single mission event provided all required grading
  areas for each certification are covered. Closed-book portions may be combined into a single
  test/assessment covering all applicable certifications.
AFISRAI14-153V1_480ISRWSUP_I 16 OCTOBER                                                        35


   4.1.5. Certifications expire on the last day of the 17th month following the month in which
   the certification was successfully completed and can be done in conjunction with applicable
   periodic evaluation.
   4.1.6. Certification Documentation.     All certification training, to include tabletop
   certifications, will be documented on AF Forms 797 and 623a and tracked on the Letter of
   Xs.
      4.1.6.1. (Added-480ISRW) Units will report status of unit members’ AOR and mission
      set certifications to 480 ISR WG on a monthly basis using ISR Group’s Letter of
      Certification (LoX).
4.2. Difference Training.
   4.2.1. Difference Training (DT) is required for qualified/certified crewmembers when a new
   feature, variation, capability or procedure is initially introduced into the AF DCGS
   Enterprise, when an existing feature is introduced to a field site, or upon PCS or TDY to a
   new/different field site.
      4.2.1.1. Initial Introduction into DCGS Enterprise-Wide Feature Application
      4.2.1.1.1. When a new feature, variation, capability or procedure is initially introduced
      to the weapon system, it requires new certification for each applicable crew position. The
      OG/CC will identify, and Wing/CC will approve the initial cadre, which is responsible to
      develop initial training materials. Units will use these materials to conduct this type of
      difference training and award certifications to all applicable crew positions for successful
      mission execution.
      4.2.1.2. Existing Feature Introduced to a field site Location
      4.2.1.2.1. DT is required when an existing feature, variation, capability or procedure is
      introduced to a field site that didn’t have it previously. That location will identify an
      initial cadre that will obtain training and training materials from a designated field site
      that operates with that feature.
      4.2.1.3. PCS/TDY to another field site
          4.2.1.3.1. Local area procedures for each field site may be different, and emergency
          area procedures for each field site will be different. When a qualified crewmember
          operates at another field site, that individual will require locally created DT prior to
          performing mission duties. Initial cadre is not necessary for this difference training
          type.
      4.2.1.4. (Added-480ISRW) New Qualification JQS line items.
          4.2.1.4.1. (Added-480ISRW) In the event new line items are added to crew position
          JQSs, ISR Group CCs will identify, and WG/CC will approve, the initial cadre to
          develop initial training materials and conduct DT for personnel already holding the
          respective crew position qualification. Instructors will update the completion date of
          new JQS line items after task certification and make appropriate 623a entry.
          Evaluation is not required following DT; all JQS line items will be evaluated during
          the next periodic reevaluation.
36                                    AFISRAI14-153V1_480ISRWSUP_I 16 OCTOBER


  4.2.2. DT may be incorporated into qualification and/or certification standards, as
  appropriate. Incorporation of difference training will be determined at the TPT.
  4.2.3. Units will use applicable AFISRA approved DT materials for enterprise-wide
  changes.
  4.2.4. Difference Training Timelines. Personnel that enter DT must accomplish the training
  within 60 calendar days (90 days for AFISRA-gained AFRC and ANG units) from the date
  entered into training.
  4.2.5. Difference Training Documentation. All enterprise-wide DT will be documented.
     4.2.5.1. (Added-480ISRW) DT will be documented utilizing a 623a entry to annotate
     when DT was started as well as an entry to annotate when DT was completed. These
     entries can occur on the same date if DT can be accomplished in a single day.
AFISRAI14-153V1_480ISRWSUP_I 16 OCTOBER                                                       37


                                           Chapter 5

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

5.1. Continuation Training (CT). This chapter outlines intelligence CT requirements for CMR
and BMC AF DCGS personnel. CT maintains the knowledge, skills and abilities of intelligence
personnel at their assigned qualification status. There are two aspects of CT. The first consists
of knowledge tasks, typically delivered in unit internal training venues. These training topics
ensure familiarization with unit responsibilities, intelligence skills and AF DCGS capabilities.
The second consists of performance tasks outlined in the Ready Intelligence Program (RIP),
which intelligence personnel must accomplish and document completion of tasks for mission
essential events with sufficient frequency to maintain currency defined for CMR and BMC.
CMR and BMC intelligence personnel must complete appropriate RIP tasks at the specified
intervals and successfully accomplish periodic mission qualification evaluations (MSN) in
accordance with AFI 14-202 Volume 2 and AFISRAI 14-153 Volume 2 to maintain currency
and qualification in each mission crew position.
   5.1.1. CT items. AF DCGS units will have these items on their annual CT plan:
       5.1.1.1. Emergency/Safety Procedures.
       5.1.1.2. Crew Resource Management.
       5.1.1.3. AOR
       5.1.1.4. RIP items (see paragraph 5.4)
5.2. Local Training. Local training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable
advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to crewmembers to enhance their skill
and job knowledge. The intent of local training is to ensure crewmembers are knowledgeable
about squadron-specific, local area procedures, local systems, related procedures, and local
directives. Units are responsible for developing and tracking local training events.
   5.2.1. (Added-480ISRW) Units will develop documentation and methodology for tracking
   CT accomplishment and provide monthly status updates to 480 ISR WG/DOT. If a
   standardized database is utilized, unit will outline local procedures for reporting and
   validation of CT accomplishment.
5.3. Refresher Training. Refresher Training is optional training which occurs when a
crewmember reports to their operational unit of assignment to review FTU trained items and can
also occur after return from a lengthy TDY or leave of absence. Squadron training POCs will
determine what refresher training is required and assign an instructor to crewmembers when
deemed necessary.
5.4. Ready Intelligence Program (RIP). The intent of RIP is to ensure BMC/CMR mission
crewmembers perform specific mission essential tasks with sufficient frequency to maintain
proficiency in assigned duty positions. RIP guidance applies to all AF DCGS AD, reserve
component and distributed mission sites.
   5.4.1. RIP is considered an integral part of CT for crewmembers because, when they go
   beyond the specific time interval for any RIP event or task, they are considered non-BMC or
   non-CMR and enter into a phased training status for the overdue event or task. The different
38                                     AFISRAI14-153V1_480ISRWSUP_I 16 OCTOBER


  levels of training required to regain BMC or CMR status are based on the amount of time the
  crewmember is overdue.
  5.4.2. AFISRA establishes and publishes AF DCGS RIP requirements.
     5.4.2.1. RIP Task definitions are provided in Attachment 3, Table A3.1 and minimum
     RIP requirements are contained in Attachment 4, Table A4.1.
     5.4.2.2. Additional or modified RIP definitions and tasking will be developed and
     updated by AFISRA. AF DCGS RIP Tasking Messages will be sent out by AFISRA/A3T
     identifying additional or modified RIP tasks.
  5.4.3. RIP tasks should primarily be conducted in the course of real-world missions. For
  those RIP events or tasks that cannot be completed during a real-world mission, other
  methods will be used. These methods include but are not limited to shadowing a live mission,
  using pre-recorded or simulated mission data, performing a scripted mock event with one or
  more associated crewmembers, or performing an academic review with a qualified
  crewmember, preferably in the same crew position, or supervisor.
     5.4.3.1. (Added-480ISRW) RIP items that must be accomplished during live missions
     will be identified in supplemental lead wing AF DCGS RIP tasking messages, as
     required.
  5.4.4. Logging RIP events. Supervisors and individual crew members are responsible for
  ensuring documentation of RIP task completion IAW local instructions.
     5.4.4.1. (Added-480ISRW) If a standardized enterprise-wide database is utilized, unit
     will outline local procedures for logging and validation of RIP accomplishment. If a
     standardized database is not available, units will develop documentation and
     methodology for logging and validating RIP accomplishment.
  5.4.5. Unit Training Office is responsible to provide a quarterly RIP status report to unit
  commander.
  5.4.6. Mission crew members must complete RIP tasks for each crew position in which they
  are qualified.
     5.4.6.1. For crewmembers qualified on two or more positions, RIP tasks shared between
     crew positions, if similar, can be applied to each applicable position’s currency
     requirements.
     5.4.6.2. Mission crew members will not log RIP events for duty positions which they are
     not qualified.
     5.4.6.3. Instructors may log crew duty tasks and instructor RIP requirements on any
     mission event in which they perform instructor duties.
     5.4.6.4. Evaluators may log crew duty tasks required for their mission crew
     qualifications as they evaluate the tasks. There are no evaluator-specific RIP
     requirements.
  5.4.7. Failure to meet RIP requirements for any given event (as calculated from the date the
  event was last accomplished) will result in loss of currency for the overdue event and
  regression to N-BMC/N-CMR status for that crew position. Members failing to meet RIP
AFISRAI14-153V1_480ISRWSUP_I 16 OCTOBER                                                    39


   requirements will be supervised by a qualified crewmember until the delinquent RIP events
   are complete as outlined in Table 5.1. Loss of instructor currency does not affect currency
   for mission crew positions in which the instructor is qualified.

                                           Chapter 6

                                 SPECIALIZED TRAINING

6.1. General. Specialized Training encompasses AF DCGS instructor and intelligence
evaluator required training. This chapter establishes the minimum requirements for AF DCGS
instructor/evaluator candidates and the required training.
   6.1.1. Documentation. Specialized training for AF DCGS Instructor will be recorded IAW
   AF/A2 and AFISRA directed documentation sources. Specialized training should also be
   documented appropriately IAW AF/A2 guidance and approved processes regarding on-line
   documentation.
6.2. AF DCGS Instructor. Instructors are experienced crewmembers who have been qualified
to instruct trainees. Instructors serve as the primary planner and task certifier in approved
training documentation and can open/close tasks and request evaluations. Instructors will be
designated in writing by the Unit/CC or designated individual.
   6.2.1. Instructor Qualification Prerequisites. This program establishes the minimum
   guidelines for those personnel identified to qualify as an instructor. Personnel selected for
   instructor must:
       6.2.1.1. Attain unit commander approval.
          6.2.1.1.1. (Added-480ISRW) In addition to uniformed military personnel, unit
          commanders may approve qualified DAF civilian and contractor personnel to instruct
          crewmembers on any crew position except for the crew positions of MOC, GMS,
          IMS, SCR, EMS, CMS, CAN, and S&W. These crew positions directly participate in
          hostilities and must only be instructed by uniformed instructors in Title 10 status.
       6.2.1.2. Maintain BMC/CMR status with a minimum Q1 on the latest evaluation in the
       crew position(s) for which they will instruct and have the following crew position
       experience:
          6.2.1.2.1. Complete a minimum of 400 mission hours in the initial crew position for
          which they hold a qualification and 200 mission hours for each subsequent crew
          position.
              6.2.1.2.1.1. Mission time conducting similar duties other than on AF DCGS may
              be considered toward instructor hours, at the discretion of the unit Commander,
              when it is determined too few missions are assigned to the unit to allow timely
              Instructor progression.
              6.2.1.2.1.2. (Added-480ISRW) Source materials other than that collected on
              live DCGS missions, such as archived DCGS training products, archived DCGS
              audio/imagery feeds and/or processed outside of mission times may count towards
              mission hour requirements for Instructor prerequisites, at the discretion of the unit
              commander, when it is determined too few missions are assigned to the unit to
              allow timely operator and instructor progression.
              6.2.1.2.1.3. (Added-480ISRW) Units         will   provide   recommendations      and
AFISRAI14-153V1_480ISRWSUP_I 16 OCTOBER                                                       41


            justification to 480 ISR WG/DOT for source materials not collected and exploited
            during live DCGS missions or collected from non-DCGS missions that may be
            considered for mission hour proficiency.
            6.2.1.2.1.4. (Added-480ISRW) Certification Instructor. Instructors who gain
            certifications that build upon their crew position qualifications (i.e. High Altitude
            Workflow Coordinator, MOC platform certification, etc. EXCEPT AOR
            certifications) must also accumulate 200 mission hours on that certification before
            they are eligible to instruct trainees on the gained certification. Instructors may
            not sign off certification training items until they have at least 200 mission hours
            utilizing that certification. Instructors for newly gained AOR certifications do not
            require additional mission hours before they are eligible to instruct trainees.
                6.2.1.2.1.4.1. (Added-480ISRW) Waivers. For qualified instructors who
                gain a certification, these individuals must accomplish a minimum of 50% of
                the required mission hours. Group Commanders may waive up to 50% of the
                certification mission hours for select qualified instructors based on previous
                AF DCGS and/or instructor experience, currency, and documentation or when
                it is determined that too few missions are assigned to the unit to allow timely
                operator and instructor progression.
                6.2.1.2.1.4.2. (Added-480ISRW) Waiver requests must include:
                  6.2.1.2.1.4.2.1. (Added-480ISRW) Justification to waive 25% of the
                  required certification mission hours for an instructor.
                  6.2.1.2.1.4.2.2. (Added-480ISRW) Summary of individual’s intelligence
                  career field experience.
         6.2.1.2.2. Meet Air Force trainer requirements IAW AFI 36-2201 and be awarded 5-
         skill level (enlisted personnel only).
  6.2.2. Instructor Training Requirements.
     6.2.2.1. Receive formal instructor training through the AFISRA-approved course.
     6.2.2.2. Successfully complete instructor training as detailed below and an instructor
     evaluation IAW AFISRAI 14-153 Volume 2.
         6.2.2.2.1. Qualified instructors are not required to repeat the instructor qualification
         process (instructor specialized training and instructor evaluation) for subsequent
         positions provided they meet the minimum mission hours.
  6.2.3. Loss/Recovery of Instructor Status. Unit commanders will remove an individual’s
  instructor status when one of the following conditions exists:
     6.2.3.1. The individual fails an evaluation on the crew position in which they are
     instructing. Instructors must successfully complete additional training assigned and/or

Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS)—A distributed, network-
centric, global system designated as the AF AN/GSQ-272 SENTINEL intelligence, surveillance
and reconnaissance (ISR) weapon system, AF DCGS consists of ground stations, mission sites,
collaborative work centers and remote entities connected in a network-centric data and
information distributed system. AF DCGS takes advantage of AF, sister service, national and
coalition sensors in the air, on land, in space, and at sea, spanning multi-INT disciplines. It
provides tailored, correlated information to those who need it at all levels across the globe, in
peace and in combat. It is scalable and comprised of fixed & deployable total force components
capable of forward-based activities & robust, full-scale reachback operations. AF DCGS is a
component of the larger DoD DCGS enterprise.
Basic Mission Capable (BMC)—The status of AF DCGS mission crewmembers who have
satisfactorily completed MQT, are qualified in the unit mission, but do not maintain CMR status.
AFISRAI14-153V1_480ISRWSUP_I 16 OCTOBER                                                          51


Basic Qualification (BQ)—Mission crewmembers who have satisfactorily completed IQT and
are qualified to perform basic duties, but may not perform mission duties unsupervised. BQ is a
prerequisite for all personnel to enter MQT. BQ is not a long term qualification status.
Certification—The status of a crewmember who has satisfactorily completed training prescribed
to maintain the knowledge and skills necessary to supplement qualifications. Certifications are
attained through methods other than evaluation and are verified by an instructor.
Collection Minimization—Procedures established to ensure adherence to national, AF and local
directives regarding restrictions to collection when performing crew mission duties.
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)—The status of intelligence personnel who have satisfactorily
completed MQT and maintain qualification and currency in the appropriate tasks and knowledge
required by this document.
Continuation Training (CT)—Continuation Training provides the volume, frequency, and mix
of training necessary for mission crews to maintain proficiency in their assigned qualification
level. It consists of local and difference training and the Ready Intelligence Program (RIP). CT
is separate from skill level upgrade training, although CT may fulfill some skill level upgrade
training requirements.
Currency—A measure of how frequently and/or recently a task is completed. Currency
requirements should ensure mission crews maintain a minimum level of proficiency in a given
event.
Difference Training (DT)—Training for new features, variations, capabilities, and/or
procedures (to include local procedures).
Direct Reporting Organization—Units that are outside of the normal AF organizational
structure, lacking a parent Group and/or Wing. For these units, any requirements normally
satisfied at the Group or Wing level moves up to the first available organization in the chain.
Enterprise Level Certification—Certification applicable across all AF DCGS units.
Fast Track— Training, qualification or certification process for personnel, identified by the unit
commander, that have demonstrated exceptional skill in a crew position. While still responsible
for all training and qualification requirements for each position through the tier progression, they
may be signed off on many/most items and evaluated more quickly than normal training
timelines.
Formal Training Unit (FTU)—A unit with a primary mission to train crew personnel according
to approved syllabi.
In-unit IQT—Training provided by unit in lieu of that provided at the FTU in-residence
courses.
Initial Qualification Training (IQT)—Initial training necessary to qualify AF DCGS mission
crews in a basic AF DCGS crew position without regard to a squadron’s specific mission. IQT
includes AF DCGS Formal Training Unit (FTU) in-residence courses as well as in-unit training
using FTU materials, when waivered.
Instructor—An experienced crewmember qualified to instruct others in operations, academics
and positional duties. Instructors can certify training completion on appropriate mission
documentation.

Intelligence Evaluator (IE)— Current and qualified (BMC or CMR) AF DCGS instructor
personnel who has completed the IE training and certification. IEs must be current and qualified
in the events they evaluate. Only IEs may conduct intelligence qualification (mission or
specialized) evaluations (initial or periodic).
Mission Qualification Training (MQT)—Training needed to qualify mission crewmembers to
perform their specific squadron mission in an assigned position. This training is a prerequisite
for CMR or BMC status.
Proficiency—The quality of having competence and a command of the fundamentals derived
from practice and familiarity. A measure of how well a task is completed. An individual is
considered proficient when he/she can perform tasks at the minimum acceptable levels of speed,
accuracy, and safety.
Proficiency Advance— Process reserved for personnel with demonstrated and documented skill
in a particular crew position, and identified by the unit commander. Individual is advanced past
lower tier position requirements, only completing the requirements for the selected higher-tier
position.
Qualification Training Packages (QTP)—Formal Training Unit formal courseware provided to
units conducting secondary method training.
Ready Intelligence Program (RIP)—A component of CT which is designed to focus on
capabilities needed to accomplish a unit’s core tasked missions. RIP events are specific to the
AF DCGS weapon system. BMC and CMR intelligence personnel must complete appropriate
RIP tasks identified in this document.
Refresher Training—Optional training provided by the local unit to AF DCGS FTU graduates
upon reporting to their operational unit of assignment. Refresher training is a review of FTU
trained items in sufficient depth and breadth to ensure the crewmember retains knowledge and
task area proficiency at the basic qualification level.
Remedial Training—Training provided to members receiving a qualification level 3 (Q-3)
during an initial, SPOT, or recurring evaluation, or for crewmembers who fail to complete CT
requirements and regress to non-CMR/non-BMC status.
RIP Tasking Message—Higher Headquarters message that establishes Ready Intelligence
Program event and frequency requirements in addition to events contained in this instruction.
Supervised Status—The status of a member who must operate under the supervision of an
instructor. BQ and BMC (unless waived) crewmembers are normally in supervised status during
operational missions.
