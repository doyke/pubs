1. Overview. This instruction satisfies the need for a corporate, business-oriented approach to
domestic partnerships to execute the AFRL Science & Technology Mission. This instruction
applies to any alliance formed between AFRL and governmental organizations (Federal, state, or
local) and is the only instruction to be used in the formulation of the same, with the exception of
host-tenant agreements and training affiliation agreements. Host-tenant agreements are governed
by AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures and Training Affiliation Agreements are
governed by AFI 41-108 Training Affiliation Agreement Program. Whenever an AFRL
organization enters into an arrangement with an organization outside AFRL, there must be a
written agreement that describes what the arrangement will be and how information will be
exchanged and protected.
     1.1. Alliances are support agreements used to document joint or collaborative working
     relationships with governmental organizations.
     1.2. Types of Support Agreements
        1.2.1. DD Form 1144. DD Form 1144 is used to document recurring reimbursable
        support provided to a federal agency. DD Form 1144 may also be used to document non-
        recurring reimbursable support. Non-reimbursable support may also be included in a DD
        Form1144 that has been prepared to document reimbursable support. In general,
        collaborations documented in a DD Form 1144 should be well defined and relatively
        limited in scope. The AFRL Commander (AFRL/CC) is the primary signatory authority
        for all strategic alliances and multi-directorate agreements documented in a DD Form
        1144. AFRL/CC may delegate this authority to the AFRL Executive Director
        (AFRL/CA) or the AFRL Vice Commander (AFRL/CV). A TD Director or the 711
        HPW Commander may sign DD Form 1144s which are tactical in nature, do not involve
        other AFRL Directorates, and where the other signatories are of commensurate levels.
        1.2.2. Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). Used with organizations external to
        AFRL. MOUs document broad areas of general understanding. An MOU is generally
        used with non-AFRL organizations to document areas of mutual interest with the intent
        to share information and maintain cognizance of relevant activities; however, there is no
        intention to establish any interdependency. Signatories are not dependent on the actions
        of the other party. The AFRL Commander (AFRL/CC) is the primary signatory authority
        for all strategic alliances and multi-directorate MOUs. AFRL/CC may delegate this
        authority to the AFRL Executive Director (AFRL/CA) or the AFRL Vice Commander
        (AFRL/CV). A TD Director or the 711 HPW Commander may sign MOUs which are
        tactical in nature, do not involve other AFRL Directorates, and where the other
        signatories are of commensurate levels.
        1.2.3. Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). Used with organizations external to AFRL.
        MOAs document the specific terms and responsibilities between two or more parties and
        may involve the commitment or exchange of significant resources. An MOA establishes
        an interdependent collaboration where the actions of each party depend on actions of the
        other party. Just as with MOUs, the AFRL Commander (AFRL/CC) is the primary
        signatory authority for all strategic alliances and multi-directorate MOAs. AFRL/CC
        may delegate this authority to the AFRL Executive Director (AFRL/CA) or the AFRL
        Vice Commander (AFRL/CV). A TD Director or the 711 HPW Commander may sign
AFRLI25-201 7 MAY 2014                                                                           3


       MOAs which are tactical in nature, do not involve other AFRL Directorates, and where
       the other signatories are of commensurate levels.
       1.2.4. Letter of Agreement (LOA). Used to document agreements between internal
       AFRL organizations. LOAs generally document the co-location of personnel, use of
       facilities, reimbursement for services, and are prepared in letter format. A separate letter
       of transmittal is not required, as the LOA consists of the letter and agreement in one
       document. LOAs are prepared for a TD Director or the 711 HPW Commander’s
       approval and signature.
   1.3. Type of Alliances
       1.3.1. Strategic alliances are of AFRL-wide corporate interest which impacts multiple
       technical directorates. Capabilities acquired or shared are unique and cannot or will not
       be produced in-house. There is a mutual benefit derived from the partnership. The
       strategic alliance is long term with a large resource commitment. Strategic Alliances may
       be supported by subordinate tactical alliances.
       1.3.2. Tactical alliances do not have an AFRL-wide corporate impact or interest.
       Capabilities acquired are unique and are not currently produced in-house. Tactical
       alliances are generally short term agreements with a specific resource commitment.
   1.4. Agreements for the temporary assignment of federal civil service personnel between
   AFRL and another DoD component will be entered into in accordance with section 3341 of
   Title 5, U.S.C. (Reference (u)), and AFRL Manual 36-104 and will be documented with a
   MOA. Agreements for the temporary assignment of federal civil service personnel between
   AFRL and a Federal agency will be entered into in accordance with DoDI 1000.17
   (Reference (v)), and AFRL Manual 36-104 and will be documented with a MOA.
   1.5. When formulating agreements with a foreign partner, Secretary of the Air Force
   International Affairs Office (SAF/IA) is the mandatory interface and the governing
   instruction is AFI 16-110, US Air Force Participation in International Armaments
   Cooperation (IAC) Programs.
2. Roles and Responsibilities.
   2.1. AFRL/CC. The AFRL Commander is the final signatory for all AFRL Strategic
   Alliances. AFRL/CC can delegate signature authority for strategic alliances to AFRL/CV or
   AFRL/CA. AFRL/CC/CV and CA will engage with and proactively seek, potential alliance
   partners at the strategic level. AFRL/CC, CV, or CA will participate in annual alliance
   reviews for strategic alliances, which are identified for review by the AFRL Alliance
   Manager (AM), AFRL Domestic Partnering Branch (AFRL/XPPD). AFRL/CC will ensure
   that sufficient resources are available to support the AFRL alliance process at the corporate
   level.
       2.1.1. AFRL Plans and Programs Directorate (AFRL/XP). AFRL/XP is the OPR for the
       alliance process. AFRL/XP will chair a review of existing AFRL Strategic Alliances
       annually.
          2.1.2. AFRL Partnering Division (AFRL/XPP). AFRL/XPP is the day-to-day
          process owner of the alliance process. AFRL/XPP is the OPR for training and
          instruction and will generate associated updates when necessary. AFRL/XPP will
4                                                                    AFRLI25-201 7 MAY 2014


          assign an AFRL Alliance Manager that is responsible for the overall alliance process
          and provides guidance to all TD and 711 HPW Alliance Managers.
              2.1.2.1. AFRL/XPP is the staffing office for all domestic alliances requiring
              AFRL/CC signature.
       2.1.3. AFRL Research Collaboration and Computing Office (AFRL/RC). AFRL/RC is
       responsible for the infrastructure to support archiving AFRL alliance information and for
       security aspects of the alliance process. AFRL/RC will establish and maintain (but not
       populate) an AFRL alliance database that will allow approved users universal access to
       all AFRL alliances.
       2.1.4. AFRL Contracting Directorate (AFRL/PK). AFRL/PK is responsible for
       independent review of any proposed strategic alliance to identify potential contracting
       issues and/or requirements. Review includes alliance adherence to AFRL investment
       policy.
       2.1.5. AFRL Legal Office (AFRL/JA). AFRL/JA is responsible for legal review of any
       proposed strategic alliance and will review tactical and transactional alliances by request.
       2.1.6. AFRL Directorate of Personnel (AFRL/DP). AFRL/DP is responsible for review
       of any proposed strategic alliance to identify potential personnel issues and/or
       requirements.
       2.1.7. AFRL Financial Management Directorate (AFRL/FM). AFRL/FM is responsible
       for review of any proposed strategic alliance to identify potential financial management
       issues and/or requirements.
    2.2. AFRL TDs and 711th Human Performance Wing (711 HPW).
       2.2.1. TDs and 711 HPW Directors. The TD Directors and 711 HPW Commander are
       the final signatories for tactical alliances. A Director may delegate signature authority for
       modifications or amendments of tactical alliances to the division level. Each Director
       will ensure compliance with this instruction by all managers, support personnel, and
       scientists/engineers within the directorate/wing. Each Director is responsible for securing
       all necessary resources for operating the alliance process at the directorate/wing level.
       The Director is responsible for overseeing the alliance process for their directorate/wing
       as set forth in this instruction. The Director will assign an individual AM to manage the
       creation, execution, review and tracking of the directorate’s alliances.
       2.2.2. Division Chief. TD and 711 HPW Division Chiefs, if delegated by the TD
       Director or 711 HPW Commander, may sign modifications or amendments of tactical
       alliances.
       2.2.3. Scientific and Technology Managers (STM). STMs (Program Managers and
       Scientists & Engineers) are the action officers that develop and manage the Science &
       Technology programs, projects and work units. STMs are the technical points of contact
       for alliance agreements. STMs work with the AM to develop the tactical Domestic
       Alliance documents. For TD and711 HPW alliances, reviews by JA and appropriate
       functional offices should also be obtained. STMs manage the relationship with the other
       organization POC and conduct the annual review to verify the agreement is still valid and
       required.
AFRLI25-201 7 MAY 2014                                                                          5


       2.2.4. TD and 711 HPW Alliance Managers. The Alliance Manager is the process owner
       and process manager for the TD or 711 HPW alliances. Duties include record keeping,
       assisting with document formulation, assisting with staffing for both review and
       approval, and day-to-day management of alliance processes and product formulation.
       The AM provides quality control functions to ensure the agreements are prepared
       accurately, and supporting division coordination is obtained prior to staff
       coordination/signature. The AM provides guidance and training as needed to their
       directorate personnel. The Directorate or Wing AM will support the AFRL-level
       strategic alliance review as required. Prior to alliance generation, the AM will coordinate
       with the TD or 711 HPW Office of Research and Technology Applications (ORTA) to
       ensure that there are no other technology transfer agreements that are more appropriate
       for the desired collaboration/partnership. The AM will make use of the alliance database,
       provided by AFRL/RC, for the generation and record keeping of all alliances. The AM
       will maintain an alliance file in the database for each agreement to include the MOA,
       MOU, or LOA and the STM’s annual review of each alliance into the Alliance Database.
3. AFRL Alliance Steps and Procedures. Once the need for an alliance has been established
the STM will contact the AM to initiate the alliance document generation process. The AM will
guide the STM through the process and provide sample documents formats. An Alliance
Checklist (Attachment 2) is provided to aid in the process. The process of creating a new alliance
of any type consists of the following steps:
   3.1. Assessment Step. The STM will coordinate with the AM to evaluate if a Strategic
   Alliance exists between AFRL and the agreement organization. The STM and AM will
   assess whether or not an existing Strategic Alliance document facilitates the desired
   collaboration between the two organizations or if a new tactical alliance document is
   required.
   3.2. Coordination Step. The STM will coordinate the terms of the agreement with the
   external organization. Administrative assistance will be provided by the AM.
   3.3. Execution Step. The STM will execute the alliance for the directorate or wing at the
   division or branch level. It is the STM’s responsibility to ensure that the execution of the
   agreement stays within the approved scope of effort. If additional work is necessary, that is
   outside the scope of the original agreement, an amendment to the agreement must be signed
   by both parties.
   3.4. Annual Review Step. The STM shall review all alliance agreements on an annual basis
   to ensure the agreements are still necessary and that all terms and conditions are still
   applicable. The annual review for each agreement should be documented by the AFRL Form
   6, Review of Domestic Alliances. Once complete the review documentation should be added
   to the agreements supporting documentation folder in the alliance database.

    3.5. Closeout Step. Generally, alliances will close upon expiration of the document. In the
    case where the parties decide to terminate early, the AM helps the STM terminate the
    alliance with the Alliance Partner by generating a termination document (a letter or email is
    acceptable) and updating the alliance database to reflect alliance termination.
