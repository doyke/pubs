1. General Information.
     1.1. Objective. Reduce number of vehicle accidents and abuses, protect personnel from
     injury or death, and eliminate unnecessary expenditure of limited monetary resources. The
     ultimate goal of this program is to minimize vehicle accidents and abuses at Kunsan AB.
     1.2. General. The base vehicle maintenance function is funded to provide preventive,
     periodic maintenance and repair damage caused by fair wear and tear, but not for accident
     and abuse repairs. Money to repair accidents and abuse damage must be transferred from the
     unit’s Operation and Maintenance (O&M) accounts.
        1.2.1. The keys to successfully reducing the number of accidents and abuses are to make
        all personnel aware of the high costs associated with the repair of accident and abuse
        repairs and encourage commanders to maintain high standards of vehicle operator
        training and discipline. Simply stated, “if you break it, you pay for it.”
        1.2.2. Consequently, commanders will transfer funds for the actual cost to repair
        accident or abuse damage to vehicles operated by their personnel according to the
        procedures in paragraph 5 of this instruction and AFI 23-302, Vehicle Management.
2. Maintenance Support.
     2.1. Vehicle Recovery Service. During normal duty hours, customers should contact the 8
     LRS, Vehicle Management Customer Service Center (8 LRS/LGRVC) at 782-5774 for
     mobile maintenance assistance. For assistance after duty hours, contact the 8 FW Command
     Post at 782-6000.
     2.2. Vehicle Management Flight (8 LRS/LGRV) provides the provides the following
     services:
        2.2.1. Scheduled Maintenance. Many maintenance actions are scheduled in advance
        based on miles, hours of operation, or calendar days. The Vehicle Management and
        Analysis Element (VM&A) will coordinate scheduled maintenance with each unit
        Vehicle Control Officer or Noncommissioned Officer (VCO/VCNCO).
        2.2.2. Unscheduled Maintenance. VCO/VCNCO ensures any motor vehicle malfunction
        is reported to the 8 LRS/LGRVC upon discovery or the next duty day.
3. Responsibilities.
8FWI24-302 18 APRIL 2012                                                                         3


   3.1. Squadron Commanders:
       3.1.1. Appoint VCO/VCNCO in writing. A copy of this appointment letter will be
       forwarded to 8 LRS/LGRV. Regardless of rank, each unit must have, at a minimum one
       primary and one alternate VCO/VCNCO.
       3.1.2. As necessary, assist the unit VCO/VCNCO in accomplishing his/her duties and
       responsibilities.
       3.1.3. Ensure unit-assigned vehicles are properly utilized, inspected, and maintained.
   3.2. Duties and Responsibilities of the VCO/VCNCO:
       3.2.1. Act as the unit focal point for all vehicle-related matters.
       3.2.2. Control all unit-assigned vehicles.
       3.2.3. Ensure organizational assigned vehicles meet all scheduled and unscheduled
       maintenance requirements.
       3.2.4. Investigate misuse, abuse, and accidents involving organizationally assigned
       vehicles.
       3.2.5. Ensure only qualified personnel operate assigned vehicles.
       3.2.6. Ensure vehicle operator inspections and maintenance are performed.
       3.2.7. Ensure all forms (inspection, waiver, accident, etc.) required for their vehicles are
       accessible and maintained accurately.
       3.2.8. Ensure operator care/preventive maintenance is performed IAW AFMAN 24-306,
       Manual for the Wheeled Operator, and AFI 23-302, on assigned vehicles.
       3.2.9. Ensure all vehicle discrepancies are identified, recorded, and corrected in a timely
       manner for all assigned vehicles.
       3.2.10. Ensure all copies of accident reports are submitted to the 8th Fighter Wing and
       Legal Office (8 FW/JA) not later than one duty day after an incident with a Privately
       Owned Vehicle (POV).
   3.3. Funding these avoidable repairs with organizational user’s funds will ensure that limited
   maintenance dollars are used to maintain the fleet and underscore the need for management
   involvement in a viable squadron-level accident and abuse prevention program. It will also
   foster an effective operator-training program, encourage operator care, prevent needless
   repairs and ultimately save wing funds by holding commanders and their assigned vehicle
   operators and VCO/VCNCO accountable.
4. Definitions.
   4.1. Abuse, Accidents, and Incidents.
       4.1.1. Vehicle abuse is defined as an act or omission that has caused damage, or may
       cause damage that cannot be attributed to fair wear and tear, accident, or incident (see
       Attachment 2). Using organizations that exhibit a trend of failing to provide vehicles for
       preventive maintenance at the scheduled time should be reported to the next command
       level (i.e., 8 MSG/CC, 8 FW/CC, etc.) for corrective action.
 4                                                                8FWI24-302 18 APRIL 2012


        4.1.2. Vehicle accident is defined as any situation where a Government Owned
        Vehicle/Equipment (GOV/E) strikes or is struck by another GOV/E, non-GOV/E, and/or
        object, structure, or animal where the action by any perceptive vehicle operator could
        have prevented the outcome.
        4.1.3. Vehicle incident is any situation where a GOV/E sustains damage where the
        actions of any perceptive vehicle operator could not have prevented the outcome (i.e., act
        of nature).
     4.2. Fair Wear and Tear.
        4.2.1. Fair wear and tear is the normal expected deterioration of a vehicle or equipment
        based on its age, usage, and life expectancy.
5. Procedures.
     5.1. The following actions shall be taken when a vehicle is involved in an accident or
     sustains damage not attributed to fair wear and tear.
        5.1.1. Vehicles damaged by accident, abuse, neglect, or any other cause shall be turned
        in to 8 LRS/LGRV as soon as damage is discovered or the next duty day if damage
        occurs after duty hours. Report U-Drive-It (UDI) or loaned vehicle damage to 8
        LRS/LGRDDO at 782-5007. Once the damaged vehicle is turned in to 8 LRS/LGRV, the
        Customer Service Center will inspect the vehicle and process a vehicle work order
        identifying initial repair cost estimate.
        5.1.2. When 8 LRS/LGRV receives a vehicle with damage that cannot be attributed to
        fair wear and tear, a memorandum will be sent through 8 LRS/CC to the commander of
        the using organization requesting the damage be investigated IAW AFMAN 23-220,
        Reports of Survey for Air Force Property.
        5.1.3. 8 LRS/CC will notify the respective commander of accident/abuses in writing, and
        will forward photographs of the damage and an estimate of repair costs.
        5.1.4. If the estimate for repair cost exceeds the vehicle’s “one-time repair limit,” the
        vehicle is considered uneconomically repairable and will not be repaired. Exceptions
        may be made on a case-by-case basis by 8 LRS/LGRV to meet mission needs.
        5.1.5. Prior to repairs, either the unit commander or respective VCO/VCNCO will be
        required to release the vehicle for repairs. Regardless of unit release, repairs will
        commence within five workdays, with the assumption that the unit did not desire to view
        the actual damage. Commanders may initiate a DD Form 200, Financial Liability
        Investigation of Property Loss, investigation into the circumstances involving an accident
        or suspected vehicle abuse case where gross negligence is evident. If the investigation
        reveals an operator was responsible for damaging a vehicle, then he/she may be liable for
        all or a portion of the repair cost.
        5.1.6. Vehicle accident and abuse repairs (material and/or contract costs) will be borne
        by the unit of assignment, regardless of determination of pecuniary liability or
        reimbursement made by an individual to the government.
            5.1.6.1. All accident and abuse repairs will be accomplished by contract maintenance
            whenever the capability exceeds the capability of 8 LRS/LGRV. For example, if the
8FWI24-302 18 APRIL 2012                                                                        5


          repair is a simple part swap out not requiring painting or body work, then all repairs
          will be completed in-house. All 8 LRS/LGRV O&M funds expended for vehicle
          accident and abuse repair costs, including contract cost, will be reimbursed to 8
          LRS/LGRV by the owning organization, or the organization responsible for the
          damage if not the owner.
          5.1.6.2. All accident and abuse repairs performed by 8 LRS/LGRV needing
          replacement parts will require a direct transfer of funds from the using organization’s
          O&M account to the 8 LRS/LGRV O&M account. This will be accomplished by a
          form letter to the responsible organization commander for endorsement and then
          forwarded to 8 CPTS for funds transfer (see Attachment 3). Courtesy copies of the
          funds transfer letter will be sent to 8 MSG/CC and 8 LRS Operations and Compliance
          Flight Resource Manager. An AF Form 20, Repair Cost and Reparable Value
          Statement, will be prepared for pecuniary liability when a member is reimbursing the
          Air Force.
      5.1.7. Owning units or the unit liable for the damage to assigned vehicles is responsible
      for the transfer of funds to the 8 LRS/LGRV O&M account. The VCO/VCNCO will
      ensure copies of accident reports are submitted to 8 FW/JA not later than one duty day
      after an incident with a POV.
      5.1.8. Due to the extended downtime for vehicles undergoing extensive repair due to
      accidents and abuses, 8 LRS/LGRV will only initiate a loaner vehicle under specific
      cases, such as when a unit falls below mission-essential level. This support will be
      limited to 30 days. Exemptions will be handled on a case-by-case basis with approval of
      the 8 MSG/CC.
      5.1.9. Resolution of disagreements concerning implementation of these policies will
      follow the normal chain of command; squadron commander to squadron commander,
      then group commander to group commander. The 8 MSG/CC is the final decision
      authority to resolve all conflicts concerning the vehicle accident, abuse, and incident
      program.
6. Exception to Reimbursements.
   6.1. Funds will not be transferred for vehicle damage repair resulting from an incident that is
   an “act of nature” or for accidents in which the operator was not a contributing factor.
   EXAMPLE:
      6.1.1. An aircrew response vehicle is parked next to an aircraft hangar. The sun melts
      snow on the hangar that in turn slides off, damaging the vehicle. This is considered an
      accident that the operator had no control over. The using organization will not need to
      transfer funds to pay for the repair costs.
6                                                               8FWI24-302 18 APRIL 2012



    6.1.2. A vehicle departs a unit parking lot, fails to yield to approaching traffic, and pulls
    into the path of a Security Forces vehicle. The 8 SFS driver and his/her squadron will not
    be held liable and funds will not be transferred. However, the unit responsible for the
    other vehicle operator which failed to yield will be held responsible for both vehicles and
    funds transfer to 8 LRS/LGRV will be required after completing repairs.
