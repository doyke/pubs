1.9. Evaluation Requirements. Accomplish evaluations concurrently, whenever practical.
Each C-17 crewmember will be evaluated at the frequency in AFI 11-202V2 and the appropriate
MAJCOM supplement:
   1.9.1. Instrument (INSTM) Evaluation. All C-17 pilots will successfully complete initial and
   periodic instrument evaluations including the requisite instrument refresher course (IRC) and
   open-book, written instrument examination according to AFMAN 11-210, Instrument
   Refresher Course Program, and an Aircrew Training Device (ATD)/flight evaluation.
   1.9.2. Qualification (QUAL) Evaluation. All C-17 aircrew members will successfully
   complete initial and periodic qualification evaluations including the requisite open-book,
   closed-book, Boldface written examinations, emergency procedures evaluation (EPE), and an
   ATD/flight evaluation.
   1.9.3. Mission (MSN) Evaluations. C-17 aircrew members will successfully complete initial
   and periodic mission evaluations. Mission evaluations should be as realistic as possible with
   a minimum of simulated events.
   1.9.4. Instructor (INSTR) Evaluations. To initially qualify as an instructor in the C-17,
   aircrew members will successfully complete an initial instructor qualification course and
   evaluation. Subsequently, aircrew members designated as instructors will be evaluated on
   their ability to instruct during all periodic evaluations.
   1.9.5. SPOT Evaluations. A SPOT evaluation is an evaluation not intended to satisfy the
   requirements of a periodic (i.e., INSTM, QUAL or MSN) evaluation. SPOT evaluations have
   no specific requisites or requirements unless specified in MAJCOM supplements. See AFI
   11-202V2 for options available to convert a SPOT evaluation to meet requirements of a
   periodic evaluation.
   1.9.6. Emergency Procedures Evaluations (EPE). See AFI 11-202V2 requirements and the
   following: Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of emergency procedures and systems
 8                            AFI11-2C-17V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2010


     knowledge for all qualification and mission evaluations.       EPEs may be accomplished
     verbally, in-flight or in an Aircrew Training Device (ATD).
        1.9.6.1. Units will develop and periodically update a list of EPE program requirements
        (topics, special interest items, etc.) in Chapter 4. The EPE will include areas
        commensurate with the examinee’s graduated training (e.g., initial, line, instructor, or
        evaluator) or as specified in AFI 11-202V2 and MAJCOM Supplement.
        1.9.6.2. Examinees may use publications that are normally available in-flight. The
        examinee must be able to recite all Boldface items from memory and provide the initial
        steps of selected emergency procedures that would not allow time for reference. Units
        will provide a list of emergency procedures in Chapter 4.
        1.9.6.3. Examinees receiving an overall EPE grade of unqualified will be placed in
        supervised status until recommended additional training and re-evaluation are completed.
        Examinees receiving an overall EPE grade of unqualified because of unsatisfactory
        Boldface procedures will not be permitted to fly in their aircrew position until a
        successful re-evaluation is accomplished. Accomplish additional training according to
        requirements in AFI 11-202V2.
     1.9.7. Evaluation Prefixes. Use AFI 11-202V2 evaluation prefixes for AF Form 8,
     Certificate of Aircrew Qualification. Use ―MSN‖ for the pilot airland evaluation, and
     ―QUAL/MSN‖ for the loadmaster airland evaluation. Identify unique mission type
     evaluation descriptions in parenthesis (e.g. MSN (AD), MSN (SOLL II), MSN (PNAF)). For
     combined pilot airland and airdrop mission evaluations annotate as ―MSN (AL-AD)‖. For
     combined loadmaster airland and airdrop evaluations annotate as ―QUAL/MSN (AD)‖. Use
     the same annotation on the AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation.
1.10. Grading Policies.
     1.10.1. The overall qualification level awarded an evaluation is based on performance during
     both the flight and ground phases. This grade should be awarded only after all evaluation
     requirements have been completed and given due consideration.
     1.10.2. To receive a qualified grade on an evaluation, the aircrew member must satisfy the
     criteria set forth for that evaluation and demonstrate ability to operate the aircraft and/or
     equipment safely and effectively during all phases of an evaluation.
     1.10.3. Use the grading criteria in this instruction to grade areas/subareas accomplished
     during an evaluation.
        1.10.3.1. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as ―required‖ in the
        general and specific evaluation sections of this instruction.
        1.10.3.2. The flight examiner may grade any area/subarea accomplished during an
        evaluation if performance in that area/subarea impacts the specific evaluation
        accomplished or flight safety.
     1.10.4. When in-flight evaluation of a required area is not possible, the area may be verbally
     evaluated or evaluated in an ATD. Flight examiners will make every effort to evaluate all
     required areas in-flight before resorting to this provision. When used, the evaluator will
     identify the area or items within the area that were verbally evaluated on AF Form 8 as an
     examiner remark (following the mission description).
AFI11-2C-17V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                9


   1.10.5. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft conditions. Minor
   or momentary deviations are acceptable, provided the examinee applies prompt corrective
   action and such deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider cumulative deviations
   when determining the overall grade.
       1.10.5.1. For pilots only, if the flight manual recommends a specific airspeed range for
       performance of a maneuver, the flight examiner will apply the grading criteria to the
       upper and lower limits of that range.
       1.10.5.2. Flight examiners will use sound judgement in the application of the grading
       criteria in this instruction to determine the final grade.
1.11. Grading System. NOTE: This paragraph for reference only and duplicates information
in AFI 11-202V2, allowing the evaluator a single-source instruction to conduct an evaluation.
When a conflict occurs, use AFI 11-202V2.
   1.11.1. Overall Qualification Levels.
       1.11.1.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q-1). The aircrew member demonstrated desired
       performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment, and directives within tolerances
       specified in this instruction. Qualification Level 1 will be awarded when no discrepancies
       were noted and may be awarded when discrepancies are noted if:
          1.11.1.1.1. The discrepancies resulted in no more than a ―Q-‖ grade being given in
          any area(s)/subarea(s).
          1.11.1.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies preclude
          awarding of an overall Qualification Level 1.
          1.11.1.1.3. All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during the
          debrief of that evaluation.
       1.11.1.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q-2). The aircrew member demonstrated the ability to
       perform duties safely, but:
          1.11.1.2.1. There were one (or more) area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training was
          assigned.
          1.11.1.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of ―U‖ was awarded.
          1.11.1.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, there is justification based on
          performance in one or more areas/subareas.
       1.11.1.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). The aircrew member demonstrated an
       unacceptable level of safety, performance or knowledge.
          1.11.1.3.1. A grade of ―U‖ awarded in a critical subarea/area requires an overall ―Q-
          3‖ for the evaluation.
          1.11.1.3.2. An overall ―Q-3‖ can be awarded if, in the judgment of the flight
          examiner, there is justification based on performance in one or more areas/subareas.
       1.11.1.4. The flight examiner will indicate all appropriate restriction(s) and additional
       training on the AF Form 8.
 10                          AFI11-2C-17V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2010


   1.11.2. Area/Subarea Grades. Areas/Subareas will have a two-level (Q/U) or three-level
   (Q/Q-/U) grading system. The overall area grade will be the lowest of any subarea grade
   awarded.
       1.11.2.1. A ―Q‖ is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a
       satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed aircrew duties within the
       prescribed tolerances and accomplished the assigned mission.
       1.11.2.2. A ―Q-‖ indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area tasks,
       but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight examiner.
       Deviations from established standards must not exceed the prescribed ―Q-‖ tolerances or
       jeopardize flight safety.
       1.11.2.3. Assign a ―U‖ area grade for any breach of flight discipline, performance
       outside allowable parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/ tolerances that
       adversely affected mission accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee
       receiving an area grade of ―U‖ normally requires additional training. When, in the
       judgment of the flight examiner, additional training will not constructively improve
       examinee’s performance, it is not required. In this case, the flight examiner must
       thoroughly debrief the examinee.
   1.11.3. Boldface. Grade Boldface either ―Q‖ or ―U.‖
   1.11.4. Critical Areas. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the aircrew
   member in order to successfully achieve the mission objectives. If an aircrew member
   receives an unqualified grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will
   also be unqualified. Critical areas are identified by ―(Critical)‖ in the area title and shading
   of Q- block on the AF Form 3862, Aircrew Evaluation Worksheet (see examples at
   Attachment 2 and Attachment 3).
1.12. Unsatisfactory Performance. NOTE: This paragraph for reference only and duplicates
information in AFI 11-202V2, allowing the evaluator a single-source instruction to conduct the
evaluation. When a conflict occurs, use AFI 11-202V2.
   1.12.1. Conduct a thorough pre-mission briefing and post-mission debriefing to the
   examinee and applicable aircrew members on all aspects of the evaluation.
   1.12.2. Immediately correct breaches of flying safety or flight discipline. When an examinee
   jeopardizes safety of flight, the evaluator may assume the duties of that aircrew member.
   This does not mean the flight examiner must assume the examinee’s position any time
   unsatisfactory performance is observed.
   1.12.3. Assign a qualification level of ―Q-3‖ for unsatisfactory performance in any critical
   area/sub-area or if the flight examiner assumes the examinee’s duties.
   1.12.4. Immediately notify the examinee’s squadron commander/operations officer and
   flight commander, if available, when less than Q-1 performance is observed.
   1.12.5. Unsatisfactory performance in a non-critical area/subarea will result in no higher
   than a qualification level ―Q-2.‖
AFI11-2C-17V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                 11


   1.12.6. Flight examiners observing unsatisfactory performance by a crewmember other than
   the examinee (including one in a different crew position) will comply with the requirements
   in AFI 11-202V2.
1.13. Conduct of Evaluations.
   1.13.1. Flight examiners will pre-brief the examinee on the conduct, purpose, requirements
   of the evaluation, and all applicable evaluation criteria. Flight examiners will then evaluate
   the examinee in each graded area/subarea.
       1.13.1.1. Flight examiners will normally not evaluate personnel they have primarily
       trained, recommended for upgrade evaluation, or who render their
       effectiveness/performance reports.
   1.13.2. Unless otherwise specified, flight examiners may conduct the evaluation in any crew
   position/seat which will best enable the flight examiner to observe the examinee’s
   performance.
   1.13.3. Note discrepancies and deviations from prescribed tolerances and performance
   criteria during the evaluation. Compare the examinee’s performance with the tolerances
   provided in the grading criteria and assign an appropriate grade for each area/subarea.
       1.13.3.1. An evaluation will not be changed to a training mission to avoid documenting
       substandard performance, nor will a training mission be changed to an evaluation.
       1.13.3.2. The judgment of the flight examiner, guidance provided in AFI 11-202V2, C-
       17 ATS courseware, and this instruction will be the determining factors in assigning an
       overall grade. The flight examiner will thoroughly critique all aspects of the flight.
       During the critique, the flight examiner will review the examinee’s overall rating, specific
       deviations, area/subarea grades assigned, and any additional training required.
       1.13.3.3. In the event of unsatisfactory performance, the flight examiner will determine
       additional training requirements. Normally, additional training should not be
       accomplished on the same flight.
EXCEPTION: Additional training on the same flight is allowed when unique situations
presenting valuable training opportunities (i.e., thunderstorm avoidance, crosswind landings)
exist. This option requires utmost flight examiner discretion and judicious application. When
used, the examinee must be informed of when the additional training begins and ends.
       1.13.3.4. When evaluations are less than Q-1 performance, immediately notify the
       examinee’s squadron commander/operations officer and flight commander (if available)
       according to AFI 11-202V2.
   1.13.4. The WST may be used to accomplish additional training and re-checks. Areas for
   additional training and re-checks should be limited to those areas/subareas that can be
   realistically accomplished in the WST.
   1.13.5. Rechecks will normally be administered by a flight examiner other than the one who
   administered the original evaluation.
1.14. Use of AF Form 3862, Aircrew Evaluation Worksheet. Units (normally OGV) will
overprint AF Form 3862, using the examples at Attachment 2 or Attachment 3, to use as an
evaluation worksheet. Copy each title, area number, and text (in the order illustrated), and
 12                          AFI11-2C-17V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2010


shading to the appropriate blocks. Units may add special interest items and/or local evaluation
requirements. In-flight, use the worksheet to ensure all required areas are evaluated. Record
positive and negative trend information and aircrew member’s performance. File the worksheet
or draft copy of the AF Form 8 in the aircrew member’s Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF)
immediately after the flight evaluation as a temporary record of the evaluation results. Maintain
until the finished AF Form 8 is added to the FEF, then discard.
1.15. Aircrew Testing. See testing requirements in AFI 11-202V2 and include the following:
   1.15.1. FTU Formal School Courses (Initial or Requalification): Complete an EOC exam
   and Boldface, administered by the ATS contractor (CBT may be used). Document EOC
   exam for AF Form 8 as ―Open/Close-book/EOC, Date completed, and the appropriate score.
   1.15.2. For recurring evaluations, C-17 ATS phase training CBTs will satisfy open-book
   exam requisite. CBT questions should be treated as a Secure Question Bank (SQB) using the
   guidance in AFI 11-202V2. Document on AF Form 8 as Open-book/ATS, Date: Various,
   and Score: Comp. A supplemental open-book exam may be developed at the unit level to
   supplement the ATS exams to include the latest local procedures, tactics, and MAJCOM/unit
   policy change. Specify supplemental open-book testing (including documentation on AF
   Form 8) requirements in the appropriate MAJCOM supplement.
   1.15.3. Closed Book Exam. A closed book exam is a requisite for the periodic qualification
   (QUAL) evaluation. Closed book questions will come from MDS-specific and local
   procedure MQFs. These questions will emphasize information and system knowledge
   necessary for safe flight and mission accomplishment. The basic exam will consist of 20 to
   30 questions. Additional questions commensurate with the crewmember’s level of
   qualification (instructor/evaluator) and/or special mission qualifications (airdrop, SOLL II,
   PNAF, etc.) will be included in the closed book exam. Complete a Boldface exam in
   conjunction with the closed book exam. See crew member chapters for additional testing
   requirements. 15AF/DOV, 21AF/DOV, and 19AF/DOV manage the C-17 MQF.
   1.15.4. Instrument Exam. The instrument written exam will be accomplished during the 6-
   month QUAL/INSTM eligibility period. The C-17 Instrument Exam CBT satisfies written
   requirements of the Instrument Exam. Document the exam completion on AF IMT 8 as
   INSTRUMENT, date completed, and the appropriate score.
1.16. Typical C-17 Evaluation Profile(s). The unit will determine the evaluation profile(s)
suitable for in-flight evaluations with unit OG/OGV approval (approval of the units’ flying
schedule satisfies this requirement). See specific aircrew chapters for enroute, SOLL II, and
airdrop requirements.
1.17. Senior Officer Requirements. See AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training, and Chapter 2.
AFI11-2C-17V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                 13


                                           Chapter 2

                                     PILOT EVALUATIONS

2.1. General. This chapter standardizes initial, periodic, and re-qualification evaluations,
including requirements for instrument, qualification, mission, and instructor evaluations. C-17
pilot evaluation process allow commander’s maximum flexibility. The process is normally
conducted in two phases; phase one (called QUAL/INSTM) will qualify the pilot in the basic
operation of the C-17 (normally completed at FTU). Phase two (called MSN) adds the
appropriate mission areas as a minimum for airland qualification. Additional mission evaluation
areas (Enroute, A/R, SOLL II, PNAF, etc) are added with unit commander approval. See
process specifics below:
2.2. Instrument Evaluations (Initial, Periodic and Requalification). The C-17 instrument
evaluation will normally be conducted in the WST in conjunction with the qualification
evaluation. Include all areas under GENERAL and INSTRUMENT. A minimum of three
instrument approaches will be evaluated, with a minimum of one precision and one non-
precision.‖
   2.2.1. PAR may be evaluated verbally, if not available.
   2.2.2. Flight pilots (FP), first pilots, and aircraft commanders accomplish CAT II ILS
   approaches and landings from the left seat. Initial qualification evaluations require
   demonstration of a missed approach and a landing. Subsequent evaluations require one
   approach to either a missed approach or landing. Copilots are evaluated on PNF duties during
   a CAT II approach to either a landing or missed approach.
   2.2.3. Non-precision approaches are flown as either straight-in or as a circling approach.
2.3. Qualification Evaluation (Initial, Periodic and Requalification).      Include all areas
under GENERAL and applicable areas under QUALIFICATION and INSTRUMENT.
Complete this evaluation is the WST. This evaluation is normally accomplished in combination
with an instrument evaluation.
   2.3.1. Co-Pilot.
       2.3.1.1. From the right seat, evaluate appropriate areas in this chapter and as illustrated
       on the evaluation worksheet example at Attachment 2.
   2.3.2. Flight Pilot (FP)/First Pilot.
   2.3.2.1. From the left seat, evaluate appropriate areas in this chapter as illustrated on the
   evaluation worksheet example at Attachment 2. First pilots are considered copilots who are
   airland mission-qualified.
   Note: Evaluate flight pilots and first pilots on at least one approach and landing in both left
   and right seats. Initial First Pilot Qualification can be accomplished without a recurring
   instrument evaluation; however, a CAT II approach, missed approach, and landing must be
   evaluated from the left seat. Recurring First Pilot evaluations will be administered as a
   Qualification and Instrument evaluation.
   2.3.3. Aircraft Commander.
 14                          AFI11-2C-17V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2010


       2.3.3.1. From the left seat, evaluate appropriate areas in this chapter as illustrated on the
       evaluation worksheet example at Attachment 2.
NOTE:
1. Evaluate aircraft commanders on at least one approach and landing in both left and right
seats.
2. Instructor pilots (and flight examiners) may be evaluated in either seat, but do not require an
approach and landing in both seats.
   2.3.4. Pilot Senior Officer.
       2.3.4.1. From the left seat, evaluate appropriate areas in GENERAL, QUALIFICATION
       and INSTRUMENT. This evaluation consists of a variety of instrument approaches and
       VFR patterns. Abnormal configuration, simulated engine-out, right seat, and CAT II
       approach and landings are not required. This evaluation is normally completed in the
       aircraft. Annotate AF Form 8 as a QUAL evaluation with expiration date, crew position
       is ―FP‖, and include a restriction in the comment section, ―fly only under direct
       supervision of a qualified C-17 instructor pilot.‖ See AFI 11-202V1, Senior Officer
       Qualification and Performance Requirement, for additional information. A qulaified C-
       17iInstructor pilot or above will be in the other seat.
2.4. Mission Evaluation (Initial, Periodic or Requalification). Include all areas under
GENERAL and applicable areas under MISSION. Combine periodic QUALIFICATION
/INSTRUMENT in the WST with the appropriate MISSION areas (see specific mission areas
below) on a single AF Form 8 according to AFI 11-202V2.
   2.4.1. Flight Pilot (FP)/Copilot (CP) (Airland-Qualified). From the right seat (either seat for
   flight pilot) evaluate applicable MISSION Areas 29 through 34. The evaluation profile will
   include aircraft preflight inspection, systems operations, low-level procedures, threat
   avoidance procedures, completion of applicable aircraft checklists, and the ability to safely
   takeoff, land, and fly the aircraft. Receiver air refueling areas may be verbally evaluated.
   2.4.2. Aircraft Commander (AC) (Airland-Qualified). From the left seat (either seat for
   instructor or evaluator) evaluate applicable MISSION Areas 29 through 34. The evaluation
   profile will include ground operations, visual low level, threat avoidance procedures, A/R
   procedures, and a tactical approach to a full flap landing on an Assault Landing Zone (ALZ).
       2.4.2.1. ALZ Size Requirements. The maximum size of the runway for the ALZ
       operations during the evaluation will be 5000’ by 100’, and marked IAW AFI 13-217. At
       night, evaluations are authorized to a lighted landing zone no larger than 5000’ by 100’,
       and a touchdown zone no longer than 500’. EXCEPTION: The OG/CC may approve, on
       a case-by-case basis, ALZ landings during the day to larger runways for recurring
       mission evaluations. The runway will be clearly marked to identify the landing zone not
       larger than 5000’ by 100’, and a touchdown zone no longer than 500’. Units will
       document on the AF IMT 8 that the OG/CC approved the ALZ operations to the said
       runway. ALZ operations on all initial and requalification mission evaluations will be to
       an ALZ not larger than 5000’ by 100’.
   2.4.3. Copilot (Airdrop-Qualified). From the right seat, evaluate MISSION Areas 29 through
   36. Evaluate the copilot’s ability to perform aircraft preflight items, operate aircraft systems
AFI11-2C-17V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                 15


   and complete aircraft checklists during en route, low-level and airdrop segments. Evaluate
   the copilot’s knowledge of airdrop procedures and ability to fly in either a visual or SKE
   formation wing position. Evaluation should consist of SKE and visual formation in both the
   lead and wing position. Formation air refueling and receiver air refueling areas may be
   verbally evaluated. Annotate on the AF IMT 8 under flight phase ―MSN (AD)‖.
   2.4.4. Aircraft Commander (Airdrop-Qualified). From the left seat (either seat for instructor
   or evaluator) evaluate applicable MISSION Areas 29 through 36. The profile will include
   ground operations, formation procedures (departure, en route, low-level, threat avoidance, air
   refueling, and recovery), SKE and visual airdrop procedures. Annotate on the AF IMT 8
   under flight phase ―MSN (AD)‖.
      2.4.4.1. If conditions after departure result in a no-drop, flight examiners may use their
      discretion to determine if the evaluation is complete.
      2.4.4.2. A minimum of two aircraft are required to complete an airdrop-qualified
      mission evaluation.
      2.4.4.3. Airdrop Method. Aircrews may employ any of the airdrop methods described in
      AFI 11-2C-17V3, C-17 Operations Procedures, Chapter 19, e.g,. mission computer
      directed/AUTO, visual timer/MAN, SKE timer, etc. The flight examiner may direct the
      crew to use a specific method, at his/her discretion.
      2.4.4.4. C-17 airdrop evaluations will consist of one SKE and one visual formation
      profile. One profile must be flown in the lead position. An actual airdrop is desired, but
      not required if in flight examiner’s judgement a satisfactory airdrop could have been
      made.
      2.4.4.5. All C-17 aircraft commanders who complete the initial airdrop AC course are
      evaluated in formation lead procedures. Squadron commander certification is required
      prior to performing lead/element lead duties on JA/ATT, exercise or contingency airdrop
      missions.
      2.4.4.6. Airdrop aircraft commanders who subsequently complete the instructor aircraft
      commander course will be instructor qualified in both the airland and airdrop missions.
      Before performing IP duties, they must be lead qualified and certified as an instructor by
      the squadron commander.

                               LOADMASTER EVALUATIONS

3.1. General. This chapter standardizes initial, periodic, and re-qualification evaluations,
including requirements for qualification, mission, and instructor evaluations.
3.2. Qualification/Missions Evaluations (Initial, Periodic, and Requalification).        Include all
areas under GENERAL and QUALIFICATION/MISSION.
   3.2.1. Initial and re-qualification evaluations:
       3.2.1.1. The examinee will perform primary loadmaster duties during cargo upload, an
       en route segment, and cargo download to complete the evaluation.
       3.2.1.2. Initial qualification/mission evaluation profile requires a minimum of two
       mission legs to include a complete preflight, cargo onload, flight, offload, and postflight.
       3.2.1.3. Initial qualification (QUAL) and initial mission (MSN) evaluations will be
       evaluated on single mission.           Upon successful completion of the initial
       qualification/mission evaluation, the AF Form 8 will indicate crew position as ―ML‖.
       The loadmaster is qualified to perform unsupervised loadmaster duties for ―airland‖ (e.g.,
       cargo/passenger). Include an expiration date.
   3.2.2. Periodic evaluations: Include all areas under GENERAL and QUALIFICATION/
   MISSION and the appropriate written exams.
       3.2.2.1. If a periodic evaluation is combined with an airdrop evaluation, an airdrop
       platform may be used for loading requirement. If a load is not available for a periodic
       evaluation, cargo will be static loaded upon completion of the flight portion.
       3.2.2.2. If both airland and airdrop periodic evaluations are successfully completed on
       the same flight, use a single line entry under flight phase indicating ―QUAL/MSN (AD)‖
       and date. Use separate line entries if more than one flight is necessary to complete the
       evaluation.
3.3. Additional Mission Evaluations.
       3.3.1. Airdrop. All initial, periodic and re-qualification evaluations will include all areas
       under GENERAL and AIRDROP. Airdrop qualification requires unit commander
       approval. Annotate on the AF IMT 8 under flight phase ―MSN (AD)‖.
       3.3.1.1. Initial. Add an expiration date for reference only (C-17 qualification is based on
       the QUALIFICATION/MISSION evaluation expiration date).
       3.3.1.2. Examinee must perform all loadmaster duties for an initial airdrop evaluation.
       Initial airdrop evaluations will include an actual sequential platform equipment airdrop.
       (EXCEPTION: A single platform airdrop may be substituted if the examinee
       demonstrates sequential platform rigging.) Other modes of aerial delivery will be
       evaluated verbally or by actual demonstration.
       3.3.1.3. An airdrop sortie and evaluation may be credited if an unplanned no-drop is
       called after completion of the Slowdown Checklist provided the no-drop was not due to
       loadmaster error. Up to three airdrop evaluations may be administered (periodic-only) on
 42                          AFI11-2C-17V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2010


       the same flight/sortie provided each loadmaster performs an airdrop preflight, all required
       rigging, and in-flight airdrop duties. Evaluation will be conducted on heavy equipment
       sorties.
   3.3.2. SOLL II (when MAJCOM-approved). All initial, periodic and re-qualification
   evaluations will include all areas under GENERAL and SOLL II.

       procedures, NVG operations, special equipment and emergency procedures. Complete
       the initial evaluation on an operational mission or training exercise.
       3.3.2.2. When evaluating a loadmaster for SOLL II qualification, annotate on the AF
       IMT 8 under flight phase ―MSN (SOLL-II)‖. Add an expiration date for reference only
       (C-17 qualification is based on the QUALIFICATION/MISSION evaluation expiration
       date).
   3.3.3. Prime Nuclear Airlift Force (PNAF) (when MAJCOM-approved). All initial, periodic
   and re-qualification evaluations will include all areas under GENERAL and MISSION area
   number 30-34. PNAF qualification requires unit commander approval. Use the following:
       3.3.3.1. Conduct initial PNAF evaluations on missions with actual or live munitions to
       the maximum extent possible. If the number of actual missions or mission segments are
       insufficient (i.e., if waiting for an actual/live munitions mission(s) would adversely affect
       individual’s upgrade or result in an unacceptable upgrade delay for the unit), the initial
       evaluation may be conducted using training or inert munitions. If training or inert
       munitions are used, all aspects of the mission (including ground security and munitions
       personnel) must simulate actual or live munitions procedures.
       3.3.3.2. When evaluating a loadmaster for PNAF qualification, annotate on the AF IMT
       8 under flight phase ―MSN (PNAF)‖. Add an expiration date for reference only (C-17
       qualification is based on the QUALIFICATION/MISSION evaluation expiration date).
       3.3.3.3. Flight examiners (not nuclear qualified) may give a spot evaluation or a N/N
       evaluation on a nuclear mission provided they meet security clearance requirements of
       the mission. Escort flight examiners who are not certified under the Personnel Reliability
       Program (PRP) according to AFI 11-299. Flight examiners who do not maintain PNAF
       currency will not fly on mission legs carrying nuclear cargo unless they obtain ACM
       approval.
3.4. Instructor Evaluations (Initial, Periodic, and Re-qualification). Flight examiners will
place particular emphasis on the examinee’s ability to recognize student difficulties and provide
timely, effective corrective action. Include all areas under GENERAL, QUALIFICATION/
MISSION, and INSTRUCTOR (include areas under AIRDROP and/or SOLL II, if applicable).
   3.4.1. To initially qualify as an instructor, the crew member must successfully complete a
   dedicated initial instructor evaluation. Accomplish initial instructor evaluations during actual
   instructional missions when possible. When students are not available or mission
   requirements/crew composition requirements prevent inclusion of students, the flight
   examiner may serve as the student for the purpose of evaluating the examinee’s instructional
   ability.

                                            Chapter 4

                                    LOCAL PROCEDURES

4.1. General. Use this chapter to define local evaluation criteria, as required.
4.2. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Applicability. This supplement applies to all 305thAMW and
514thAMW personnel, assigned or attached, unless stated otherwise. For purpose of this
supplement, ―squadrons‖ refer to Operations Group (OG) flying squadrons based at McGuire
AFB or forward deployed. Waivers to this supplement and AFI 11-2C-17, Volume 2 must be
coordinated through 305/514 Operations Group Standardization/Evaluation (OGV).
4.3. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Testing Requirements. Every effort should be made to
accomplish all required testing before administering the evaluation.
4.4. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Failure to Pass an Exam.
   4.4.1. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Validate each failure to ensure each missed question is
   valid and current. Once verified, Sq Stan/Eval (DOV) will fill out a ―Written Examination
   Failure Memorandum‖. Advise the individual that they are in supervised status until a
   successful retake is accomplished. Provide a copy of the letter to the individual. The
   memorandum must be reviewed/completed by the SQ/DO, SQ/CC, and scheduler. Required
   training will be completed before a re-take is accomplished. File the memorandum within
   the individual’s Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) until the discrepancy has been corrected.
   Document details of failed examination in the quarterly (514th AMW semiannual)
   Standardization and Evaluation Board (SEB).
   4.4.2. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) For all examination failures, notify the SQ/CC, DOV
   Chief, FLT/CC, and aircrew scheduling. Place crewmembers that fail a requisite exam in
   supervised status until a successful retest has been accomplished.
   4.4.3. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Notify 305/514 OGV of all examination failures.
   4.4.4. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) A different version of the test will be given to the
   examinee for a retest. The retest should not be taken on the same day, but must be
   accomplished by the end of the third month following the date of the failure. See AFI 11-202
   Volume 2 AMC Sup 1, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, paragraph 6.4.7.2, for
   waiver procedures.
4.5. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Emergency Procedure Evaluations (EPE) Program
Requirements. As a minimum, the EPE will include the following areas as applicable per crew
position: Directives and Publications, Life Support Systems/Egress, Boldface, Other (Observed)
Emergency Procedures, and Systems Operations/Knowledge.
4.6. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Special Interest Items (SIIs). Identified SIIs will be evaluated
on all evaluations. Applicable SIIs are identified by Flight Crew Information Files (FCIFs) and
Flight Crew Bulletins (FCBs). SIIs will be posted in all squadron briefing rooms.
4.7. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Pilot Evaluation. There are 5 types of McGuire Air Force
Base C-17 Pilot evaluations: Combined Instrument and Qualification (INSTM/QUAL), Mission
(MSN), Instructor (INSTR) and SPOT evaluations. McGuire assigned Weapons Instructor
AFI11-2C-17V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2010                                               55


Course (WIC) graduates that have been approved to maintain their airdrop qualification will
have their airdrop flight evaluation annotated as MSN AIRDROP (AD).
4.8. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Mission Evaluation.
   4.8.1. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Depart direct to the air refueling followed by low-level
   navigation on a Military Training Route (MTR) to a tactical arrival at an Assault Landing
   Zone (ALZ). Visual Flight Rules (VFR) pattern and ground operations can be accomplished
   at home station or the ALZ airfield. Check ride profiles can be adjusted to allow flexibility
   in scheduling low levels, tankers, and ALZ times.
   4.8.2. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Low-Level Operations. Examinees will plan to fly low-
   levels on MTRs or on an approved random route. Evaluators must sample threat reaction and
   tactical situational awareness during the mission. This can be accomplished during the low-
   level or anytime when flying using VFR.
   4.8.3. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Due to the lack of Instrument Route (IR) MTRs in the
   vicinity of McGuire AFB and the emphasis on fuel conservation, accomplishing an actual
   low-level on a mission evaluation during inclement weather may not be possible. Therefore,
   if the weather forecast predicts low ceilings and/or visibility during mission planning, the
   evaluatee should plan to fly a slow route (SR) to maximize the potential for successful
   accomplishment (less restrictive weather requirements than visual routes (VR)).
   4.8.4. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) If weather does not support low-level entry during
   execution, evaluators may permit flying the VR or SR routing while under an Instrument
   Flight Rules (IFR) clearance at Air Traffic Control (ATC) controlled minimum safe altitudes
   for a First Pilot (FP) evaluation. In this case, the filed DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan,
   will need radial/DME fixes entered for each low-level waypoint and the crew will coordinate
   intentions with ATC to not cancel IFR clearance. Following guidance in Flight Information
   Publications (FLIP) AP1/B and AFI 11-2C-17 Volume 3, C-17 Operations Procedures,
   satisfies low-level requirements for FP evaluation purposes. Aircraft commander mission
   evaluations that were unable to accomplish a visual low level will be incomplete.
4.9. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Night Vision Goggle (NVG) Operations. Crews will use
NVGs during night flight evaluations to the maximum extent possible for appropriate mission
areas assuming proper environmental conditions exist.
4.10. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Tactics. Knowledge and application of tactics, techniques and
procedures are vital to operational effectiveness, combat readiness and mission success and will
be evaluated on all mission evaluations. Crewmembers will be evaluated commensurate with
their crew position. Crews should operate the Countermeasures Dispensing System (CMDS) and
Missile Warning System (MWS). Aircraft Commanders (ACs) are expected to provide clear
guidance to the crew regarding desired look-out doctrine, threat calls and crew duties if engaged
by a simulated threat. The evaluator may role-play the function of airborne Command and
Control (C2) platform, Combat Reporting Element (CRE) or Air Support Operations Center
(ASOC) to facilitate evaluating battle space interoperability methods and procedures. Evaluators
should make changes or updates to threat information en route to evaluate the crew’s
incorporation and application of the data. The crew should use the Mission Computer (MC) to
maintain maximum situational awareness in the threat environment and employ appropriate
tactics, techniques and procedures to avoid or mitigate threats.
 56                          AFI11-2C-17V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2010


4.11. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Air Refueling. Sustained contacts with the auto-pilot on and
auto-pilot off are desired; however, evaluators may allow just auto-pilot off contacts for
recurring evaluations.
   4.11.1. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Ground operations should be accomplished after an
   approach and landing in order to evaluate mission checklists in the correct sequence and
   pacing.
4.12. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Pilot Instrument/Qualification Evaluation (INSTM/QUAL
Eval)
   4.12.1. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) The INSTM/QUAL eval should be accomplished in the
   local McGuire AFB pattern in the Weapons System Trainer (WST).
4.13. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Profile Development. Profiles will be at the discretion of the
evaluator giving the evaluation. 305/514 OGV will provide suggested profiles upon request.
Profiles should be flown ―real time‖ with minimum use of the ―new jet, new day‖ concept or
repositioning of the simulator.
4.14. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Pilot Operational Mission Evaluation (OME). This
evaluation is not required for pilots currently/previously certified to operate in command of the
subject Mission Design Series (MDS). The main focus areas of the SPOT evaluation are
decision making and Crew Resource Management (CRM). At a minimum, two mission legs, an
instrument approach and landing, off-station Remain Overnight (RON) (desired), and tactical
maneuvers (if practical), should be evaluated. The OME does not have to be conducted flying
into the Area of Responsibility (AOR). Evaluate both pilot flying (PF) and pilot monitoring
(PM) duties. Include the following in the remarks section of the AF Form 8, Certificate of
Aircrew Qualification: ―this OME was conducted in conjunction with aircraft commander
certification.‖
4.15. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Loadmaster Qualification/Missions Evaluation
4.16. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) General Guidelines. There are three types of McGuire AFB
C-17 Loadmaster Evaluations: Qualification/Mission (QUAL/MSN), Instructor (INSTR), and
SPOT evaluations.
   4.16.1. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Loadmaster qualification/proficiency level needs to be
   considered when determining knowledge and job performance, i.e., Mission Loadmaster
   (ML) or Instructor Loadmaster (IL).
   4.16.2. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) All loadmaster evaluations will include accomplishment
   of the Interior Safety Inspection. This may be verbally debriefed if, in the opinion of the
   aircraft commander or the evaluator loadmaster, it will delay the mission.
4.17. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) No-Notice Evaluations. When administering no-notice
evaluations, as a minimum, evaluate all items under the ―General‖ area of AF Form 3862,
Aircrew Evaluation Worksheet, and all applicable SIIs.
4.18. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Unsatisfactory Performance.
   4.18.1. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) For evaluations graded Q-2, Q-3/1, or Q-3, document the
   deficient areas and any recommended training on the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew
   Qualification. If necessary, use Training Management System (TMS) to document extensive
AFI11-2C-17V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP_I 15 SEPTEMBER 2010                                                57


   additional training. Squadron Standardization/Evaluation (DOV) is responsible for notifying
   the training section, ensuring Aviation Resource Management (ARMS) documentation
   completion (AF Form 4324, Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew Qualification Worksheet), tracking
   the requalification period, and including the individual in the next Review and Certification
   (R&C) cycle. Training section is responsible for ensuring complete TMS documentation and
   scheduling all required training in the allotted time. When the training is complete, the
   instructor/examiner completing the training will sign as the Certifying Official under
   Additional Training, Section II of the Form 8, verifying completion of all assigned training as
   documented in paragraph C. (See 305/514 AMW Form 8 Guide).
   4.18.2. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) If an individual receives a Q-2 or Q-3 while in the en
   route system, every effort will be made to have that individual return to McGuire AFB as
   soon as possible. Upon arrival at home station, the individual will enter requalification
   training without delay.
   4.18.3. (Added-MCGUIREAFB) Notification of OGV for less than Q-1 evaluations.
   Squadron DOV will notify OGV of any evaluations graded less than Q-1. A copy of the AF
   Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, will be emailed or faxed to OGV within five
   working days.
