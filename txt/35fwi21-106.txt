    MOS/ AMU PS&D/Propulsion Flight agencies by close of business Friday of each week for
    line replaceable units (LRU) and shop replaceable units (SRU). The most recent weekly
    forecast will be included in the monthly maintenance schedule.
       1.8.1. Proactively work with MOS Plans Scheduling and Documentation (PS&D) to
       forecast and suggest scheduled dates for all engine-related special inspections, TCI and

       TCI replacements prior to over-fly status.
    1.9. Produce a daily engine status report and send to 35 MOS/MXOOC--Maintenance
    Operations Center (MOC) NLT 0800 daily. As a minimum, copies of the status slides should
    be sent to the command engine manager, the Commander, 35th Maintenance Group (35
    MXG/CC), 35 MXG/CD, 35 MXG/CEM, 35 MOS/CC, 35th Maintenance Squadron (35
    MXS) Propulsion Flight Chief, Osan AB engine manager and Kunsan AB engine manager.

        (i.e. AEF needs).
        5.1.5. PACER engine(s) shall not be placed on the spare line for more than 5 duty days.
        5.1.6. PACER engine(s) will receive priority placement to ensure they are installed in
        aircraft as soon as possible. Consideration will be made to remove a PACER engine
        from any aircraft that is down for maintenance more than 7 duty days and reinstall it in
        another aircraft scheduled for sorties.
        5.1.7. PACER engine goal is a minimum of 100 total accumulated cycles (TACs) per
        month.

     and e-mail and give part number, national stock number, quantity, and requisition number
     (off-base document number).
     5.1.10. Replacement of a PACER engine part and/or component with earlier released
     version (i.e., replace a PN XXXXXXXG04 with a PN XXXXXXXG03) is not authorized
     without prior approval of the PACER Committee.
     5.1.11. When a PACER engine or accessory is damaged and requires significant repair,
     the owning work center will immediately coordinate with EME to notify the
     MAJCOM/LGM and PACER Committee chairperson in turn via telephone and e-mail.
     5.1.12. Engine components returned to serviceable status by the PACER committee,
     which do not meet life limits in Air Force TO (waiver will be attached to component),
