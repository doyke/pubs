1. General Information. The CAA with amendments resulted in the USEPA creating standards
that focused upon air quality. Title V of the CAA classifies sources into major or area sources.
A major source is defined as having the potential to emit (PTE) either criteria pollutants or
hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). The threshold for criteria pollutants is PTE in quantities greater
than 100 tons per year (tpy) and the threshold for HAPs is PTE in quantities greater than 10 tpy
for any single HAP, or 25 tpy for any combination of HAPs. Tinker qualifies as a major source
due to exceeding both thresholds. Major sources are issued Title V permits. These permits set
forth specific requirements that govern operation of air emission sources at a major source.
2. Reporting. Records submitted by OC-ALC to 72d Air Base Wing/Environmental
Management (72 ABW/CEIE) shall be used to validate compliance to regulatory authorities
[Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) and USEPA]. These reports certify

VOC—Volatile Organic Compound

Terms
Air Pollution Control Equipment— Equipment that is installed and/or operated primarily for
control, capture, and/or removal of pollutants from the air.
Allowable Operating Range— The operating range established after all three (3) filters of a
paint booth are changed. The lower range limit is the new differential pressure gauge reading
and the upper range limit is equal to the lower range limit plus one (1) inches of water column.
Chromium Anodizing—The electrolytic process by which an oxide layer is produced on the
surface of a base metal for a functional purpose (e.g., corrosion resistance or electrical
insulation) using a chromic acid solution. In chromium anodizing, the part to be anodized acts as
the anode in the electrical circuit, and the chromic acid solution, with a concentration typically
ranging from 50=100 grams per liter (g/L), serves as the electrolyte.
Class 1 ODS Substances— Refrigerants that include chlorofluorocarbons, halons, carbon
tetrachloride, hydrobromofluorocarbons, methyl bromide and methyl chloroform.
Class 2 ODS Substances— Refrigerants that include all of the hydrochlorofluorocarbons.
Data Calls— Information requested for the purpose of analysis and used in a decision making
process.
Emergency— Producing power for critical networks or equipment (including power supplied to
portions of a facility) when electric power from the local utility is interrupted.
Emission Testing— evaluating the exhaust emissions in accordance with 40 CFR 63.6620, if
required.
Hand Wipe Cleaning.— The removal of contaminants such as dirt, grease, oil and coatings
from an aerospace vehicle or component by physically rubbing it with a material such as a rag,
paper, or cotton swab that has been moistened with a cleaning solvent.
Hard chromium— Electroplating or industrial chromium electroplating means a process by
which a thick layer of chromium (typically 1.3 to 760 microns) is electrodeposited on a base
material to provide a surface with functional properties such as wear resistance, a low coefficient
of friction, hardness, and corrosion resistance. In this process, the part serves as the cathode in
the electrolytic cell and the solution serves as the electrolyte. Hard chromium electroplating
process in performed at the current densities typically ranging from 1,600 to 6,500 A/m 2 for total
plating times ranging from 20 minutes to 36 hours depending upon the desired plate thickness.
Other— Non-emergency situations such as peak shaving or to generate income for a facility to
supply power to an electric grid.
Process Owner— The organization responsible for the control and/or operation of a production
process.
USEPA Method 319— The method is limited to determination of the initial (particle size
dependent) filtration efficiency of the clean condition of paint arrestors. Changes in efficiency
(either increase or decrease) due to the accumulation of paint overspray on and within the
arrestor are not evaluated. This method applies to particles over the diameter range of 0.3 to 10
µm. The method is applicable to efficiency determinations from 0 to 99 percent. Two test
