3.10.10.The EM Flight Chief and Deputy Chief are designated as the primary and alternate
MacDill EOC Managers.
3.10.13.2.Because of its unique geographical location and configuration, MacDill AFB is one of
the most hurricane vulnerable installations in the United States. Personnel are not sheltered on
base during these natural disasters. When tropical storms and hurricanes threaten the Tampa Bay
region and MacDill AFB areas, unit commanders must ensure all assigned personnel and
dependents (including dependents of deployed or short tour assigned personnel) are accounted
for, protected from the effects of the storm, and prepared to evacuate if necessary. This is
accomplished through the Adopt-A-Family (AAF), Safe House, and Safe Haven programs as
defined in MacDill Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2 and
administered as defined below.
3.10.13.2.1. (Added)All personnel should be surveyed to determine if they live in an area
identified for evacuation by the county or if they live in a manufactured or mobile home. Include
procedures to survey newly assigned personnel during unit in-processing.
3.10.13.2.2. (Added)Personnel residing in manufactured or mobile homes in the Tampa Bay
region (regardless of location or surge zone) should be matched with a volunteer family for
sheltering during all hurricanes regardless of category. Mobile or manufactured homes are NOT
considered suitable Safe Houses regardless of location.
3.10.13.2.3. (Added)Personnel that evacuate prior to the issuance of the official evacuation
order will be considered on leave and, therefore, are not eligible for reimbursement until such
time as the evacuation order is issued.
3.10.13.2.4. (Added)Personnel should "reach back" to their units through their chain of
command and/or UCC to report safe arrival at their Safe House or Safe Haven location. They
also should log onto the Air Force Personnel Accountability and Assessment System (AFPAAS)
https://afpaas.af.mil/cas/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fafpaas.af.mil%2F.af.mil                 and
update the accountability status of sponsor and dependents. If contact is not successful using the
local chain of command, personnel should report their status and whereabouts using the National
Disaster Registry (NDR) Web Application administered by HQ AFPC. Access the registry via
the internet at https://w11.afpc.randolph.af.mil/ndwnet. The NDR can also be reached via
telephone 1-800-435-9941.
3.10.15.Unit commanders will ensure all facilities assigned to their organization that are
normally occupied have a shelter-in-place program that complies with the MacDill Shelter-in-
Place Guide.
3.11.1.1.Units identified in Attachment 8, Unit Support, require primary and alternate EM
representatives. Unit EM Representatives will be appointed in writing by the unit commander
using the EM Quarterly Report. Responsibilities of the unit EM representative are outlined in
Attachment 9.
3.11.1.2.4.Unit EM Representatives will maintain a Unit EM Continuity Binder according to
Attachment 10.
3.11.3.Units identified in Attachment 8 require EOC representatives.

Training Technician before they will be given an Automated Civil Engineer System-Personnel
and Readiness (ACES-PR) log on identification and password.
6.4.3.3.2. (Added)In the event that ACES is down, scheduling will be accomplished by email.
6.4.3.3.2.1. (Added)E-mail requests for training must include specific details (date/time of class,
name/rank of person to be scheduled, unit of assignment, and the scheduler’s name and
telephone number).
