     The Average Number of Launch Operations Per Year x Level Factor = Alert Rate
                  Mission Ready Personnel in Unit
     5.12.2. (Added-14AF) Definitions.
         5.12.2.1. (14AF) Average Number of Launch Operations Per Year. Based on the previ-
         ous 3 years of launch operations conducted by the unit. The following are specifically
         NOT included in the average: scrubbed launches; Mission Dress Rehearsals; Wet Dress
         Rehearsals; Simulations; Competitions; and Exercises. Only one launch operation for
         each Operation Number may be used in the calculation (for example, a Navy operation
         may launch 1 or more missiles, but this constitutes one launch operation). This rein-
         forces the importance of launching at first opportunity and limits it to critical operations.
         5.12.2.2. (14AF) Mission Ready Personnel in Unit. Based on the number of Mission
         Ready personnel currently certified in the unit assigned. These positions are defined as:

           Launch Director, launch Controller, Range Control Officer, Range Operations Com-
           mander, Aeronautical Control Officer, launch Weather Officer, Flight Control Officer,
           and Upperstage Vehicle Manager.
           5.12.2.3. (14AF) Level Factor. This factor ensures time of service is consideration. use
           two levels of awards by having level factor of 1.5 years and 3 years. These level factors
           approximate the Missile 100 and 200 alert certificates.
           5.12.2.4. (14AF) Alert Rate. This rate is calculated after each launch operation con-
           ducted by the unit. Personnel are awarded certificates for two different levels using the
           following rules. All levels use "round up" alert rates, e.g., an Alert Rate of 1.3 is rounded
           up to 2 for determining award recipients. The first level alert rate (using 1.5 years level
           factor) must be at least 1. The second level alert rate (using 3 years level factor) must be
           at least 2.
       5.12.3. (Added-14AF) Examples. The following examples use actual data as of 1 Jun 95.

   5.16. AFSPC Crew Member Excellence Award. This award recognizes sustained highly qualified
   performance during space operations evaluations.
      5.16.1. To be eligible, individuals must achieve a minimum of five highly qualified (HQ) ratings
      out of seven consecutive evaluations. An unqualified (UQ) rating resets the counter to zero. HQ
      ratings are cumulative in all space operations mission areas (e.g., ICBM operations, missile warn-
      ing, etc.) Individuals previously recognized under similar programs do not automatically qualify
      for recognition under this program. To qualify, individuals must show documented proof of pre-
      vious evaluation results that meet established requirements. Evaluations conducted prior to imple-
      mentation of this instruction and which meet the above criteria count toward eligibility with the
      following guidance:
          5.16.1.1. No critical, restricted, major, or listed errors were committed during any evaluation.
          5.16.1.2. No more than four minor errors or non-mission critical deficiencies were committed
          during any evaluation.
      5.16.2. Wing/groups will administer the program using guidance within this instruction. HQ
      AFSPC/DOT will provide AFSPC Form 186, Crew Member Excellence Award Certificates and
      patches to the units. Wing/group commanders will sign the certificates prior to presentation.

                      SPACELIFT LEVEL 1 AND 2 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

A1.1. Apply the following formula for determining eligibility for award of Spacelift Crew Member Level
1 and Level 2 Launch Certificates:
Average Number of Launch Operations per Year (ALNO)            X     Level Factor     =    Alert Rate
    Mission Ready Personnel in Unit (MRPU)

A1.2. Definitions:
   A1.2.1. Average Number of Launch Operations per Year. Based on the previous three years of launch
   operations conducted by the unit. The following are specifically excluded in the average: scrubbed
   launches, Mission Dress Rehearsals, Wet Dress Rehearsals, Simulations, Competitions, and exercises.
   Only one launch operation for each operation number may be used in the calculation. For example, a
   Navy operation may launch more than one missile, but this constitutes one launch operation.
   A1.2.2. Mission Ready Personnel in Unit. Based on current number of mission ready personnel cur-
   rently certified in the unit assigned.
   A1.2.3. Level Factor. Use 1.5 for level 1 certificates and 3 for level two certificates.
   A1.2.4. Alert Rate. This rate is calculated after each launch operation conducted by the unit. Person-
   nel are awarded certificates for two different levels using the following rules.
       A1.2.4.1. All rates will be rounded up for determining award recipients.
       A1.2.4.2. Level 1 alert rate must be at least 1. Level 2 alert rate must be at least 2.

A1.3. Examples. The following chart uses actual data as of 1 Jun 95. Using this data, personnel assigned
to the 1 SLS would have to be involved with at least 2 launch operations (1.5 rounded up to 2) to receive
a level 1 certificate and at least 3 operations to receive a level 2 certificate. Personnel assigned to the 45
RANS would have to be involved in at least 5 operations (4.3 rounded up to 5) to receive the level 1 cer-
tificate and at least 9 operations (8.6 rounded up to 9) to receive a level 2 certificate.
