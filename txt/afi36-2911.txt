                                          Chapter 1

                              UNAUTHORIZED ABSENCES

1.1. Responsibilities. All members must be present for duty when and where they are ordered
or required to be. Commanders and supervisors at all levels must make sure that all members
understand and carry out their responsibility to be present and on time for duty. Commanders
and supervisors must act promptly when a member is not present for duty.
1.2. Commanders at all levels:
   1.2.1. Set up management practices and programs to deter absenteeism and desertion.
   1.2.2. Publicize the deserter apprehension program to deter potential absentees.
   1.2.3. Develop programs to make sure that the maximum number of absentees or deserters,
   who return to the military and have the potential for continued service, continue to serve.
   1.2.4. Ensure compliance with this instruction.
   1.2.5. Approve and electronically sign Human Resources (HR) type Personnel Program
   Application (PPA)-Duty Status Change (AWOL/Deserter) request in Case Management
   System (CMS) and forward to AFPC/DPWCM, AWOL/Deserter Program Manager, for
   processing.
1.3. When Unauthorized Absence Begins and Ends. An unauthorized absence starts when a
member is absent from where he or she is ordered or otherwise required to be present. For an
unauthorized absence of 24 consecutive hours or less, classify as ―failure to go‖ instead of
―absence without leave‖ (AWOL). For an unauthorized absence of more than 24 hours and less
than 30 days, classify as AWOL. Example: If a member is required to be at work at 0730 on
Monday but does not report to work, the member will not be reported as AWOL until Tuesday at
0730 (after 24 hours of unauthorized absence), with the effective date and time of Monday 0730.
An unauthorized absence ends when the absentee or deserter returns to military control.
1.4. Required Actions. Table 1.1 is a comprehensive list of actions to be taken upon discovery
of an unauthorized absence. Even if you expect the absence may be excused, immediately take
the actions listed in Table 1.1
1.5. Classify a member as a deserter who:
   1.5.1. Has been AWOL for 30 consecutive days. If the absence lasts through 2400 on the
   30th consecutive day, change the absentee's status to deserter at 0001 on the 31st day (on the
   10th day during times of emergency or war declared by the President or Congress). Note:
   Member does not have to be placed in AWOL status prior to being placed in deserter status if
   the member meets the criteria in paragraph 1.5.2.
   1.5.2. Is AWOL for any amount of time and meets any of these criteria:
       1.5.2.1. The commander has determined, as the result of the investigation, that the
       member has no intention of returning
       1.5.2.2. Is under the duty or travel restrictions that DoD 5200.2-R/AFI 31-501 imposes.

                1.5.2.3. Has had access in the past 12 months to Top Secret information or other
                classified information that requires special access authority (see paragraph 2.2.7). Note:
                Do not classify a person who appears to be a casualty as a deserter solely because the
                person has had access to classified material described herein.
                1.5.2.4. Has gone to, or stayed in, a foreign country and, while there, has asked for or
                taken any type of asylum or resident permit from that country or its governmental
                agencies.
                1.5.2.5. Has action pending on a previous unauthorized absence that has not been
                completed.
                1.5.2.6. Is an escaped prisoner.
                1.5.2.7. Is under investigation for violating the Uniform Code of Military Justice
                (UCMJ) as listed in Attachment 4 or against whom charges for any offense have been
                referred to a General Court-Martial.
                1.5.2.8. AFPC/DPWCM has determined member is in a deserter status.
                1.5.2.9. Goes or remains absent from his or her unit, organization, or place of duty with
                intent to remain away from there permanently.

     Commander, Support Staff, and MPS.
     2. For TDY personnel, notify the member's unit of assignment.
     3. Do not report the absentee to the security forces until it is clear the member is absent from the
     unit rather than failing to report or being late for duty.
     4. Reserve units contact the nearest active duty security forces unit for assistance.
     5. If the unit commander immediately classifies the member as a deserter prior to the 31st day of
     unauthorized absence, take the actions outlined in steps 1 through 5 (except 31-Day Status
     Report) disregarding time sequence. Send the 31-Day Status Report on the 31st day (10th day
     during times of emergency or war declared by the President or Congress).
     6. The commander of the base where a member is transferred permanent change of station
     (PCS) without permanent change of assignment (PCA) for separation is authorized to initiate HR
     type PPA-Duty Status Change in CMS for reporting the unauthorized absence.
     7. When Congress or the President declares an emergency or war, the unit commander’s 30-Day
     Status Report and DD Form 553 will be prepared and dispatched on the 10th day vice the 31st
     day. Prepare and distribute DD Form 553 immediately for those individuals who have been
     absent without authorization for 11 to 31 Days.
     8. Reserve commanders will contact ANGSC/MPP (for ANGUS members), or HQ AFRC/A1K
     (for USAFR members), and ask for instructions.
     9. Ensure that the FPRG contains copies of Duty Status Change Request and Next-of-Kin
     Letters, the original commander’s 72-Hour Inquiry Letter, 31-Day Status Report, 60-Day Status
     Report, DD Form 553, and the unfavorable information file (UIF) (if applicable), showing that
     all necessary actions have been taken. The FPRG should also include the member’s medical and
     dental records and any other documents that may be useful upon the deserter’s return to military
     control (i.e., OSI investigations, security forces reports, charge sheets, etc.).

10. The member’s FPRG is forwarded to AFPC/DPWCM, 550 C. Street West, Suite 14,
Randolph AFB TX, 78150-4717, on 180th day. If the member’s records are electronic, the
UPRG is electronically stored by AFPC/DPSSRR, Automated Records Management System
Office (ARMS), on the 180th day. The commander’s support staff will obtain the member’s
medical and dental records and forward them to AFPC/DPWCM, 550 C. Street West, Suite 14,

MilPDS to Financial Services Office to update the member’s Master Military Pay Account
(MMPA).
12. Organizations and units that retain 3SO MPS authorizations for the purpose of performing
MPS work will not receive the MPS services outlined under the FSS/MPS structure. Those
duties will continue to be performed by the unit unless they establish an agreement with the MPS
to service that population in a particular program. Without formalized agreements between both

                       REPORTING UNAUTHORIZED ABSENCES

2.1. Reporting Responsibilities. Unauthorized absences must be reported immediately.
Supervisors must promptly notify the chain of command. Unit commanders have the primary
responsibility to determine the cause of absence and to find and return the individual to military
control.
2.2. The Unit Commander:
   2.2.1. Investigates the case looking for any indication that the absence results from an
   involuntary casualty rather than desertion or unauthorized absence. In such situations, Duty
   Status-Whereabouts Unknown (DUSTWUN) may be appropriate. Consult AFI 36-3002,
   Casualty Services. The member’s welfare is of highest concern. Notifies commander
   support staff (CSS) or MPS to initiate HR type PPA-Duty Status Change (AWOL/Deserter)
   request in CMS and forward to AFPC/DPWCM, AWOL/Deserter Program Manager, for
   processing.

       Point (DSN 665-3727 or 1-800-531-5501). Ensures their CSS or MPS sends an email to
       AFPC/DPWCM.AWOLDeserter@Randolph.af.mil confirming deserter status within 1
       duty day of placing member in deserter status.
       2.2.1.2. Logs into CMS to approve Duty Status Change Request initiated by CSS or
       MPS staff and refers case in CMS to AWOL/Deserter Program Manager
       (AFPC/DPWCM) within 1 duty day.
   2.2.2. Promptly notifies all those who need to know about the absence; for example, the
   security forces, the servicing financial services office (FSO), the postal service center or the
   unit mailroom of the absentee’s organization, and the base exchange.
   2.2.3. Unit Commander's 72-Hour Inquiry Letter (Figure 2.1). The unit commander reports
   on the inquiry based on case action (Table 1.1, steps 1, 2 and 3). The unit commander sends
   the letter to AFPC DPWCM, (Fax DSN 665-4757 or 210-565-4757) and the installation’s
   chief of security forces. The 72 hours begins the first day the member is absent. The letter:
       2.2.3.1. Includes all relevant information on the case; for example, the absentee's duty
       status when the unauthorized absence began, the leave address if the absentee was on
       leave, and/or the gaining unit and leave address for delay en route if the absentee was
       being reassigned.
       2.2.3.2. Lists actions taken to locate the absentee, including actions taken on leads.
       2.2.3.3. Includes whether the absentee faces pending administrative discharge action or
       action under the UCMJ.
       2.2.3.4. Lists all previous unauthorized absences and their disposition.
       2.2.3.5. Includes a statement that AFI 36-3002, Casualty Services, specifically in regard
       to Duty Status- Whereabouts Unknown (DUSTWUN), has been considered and is not

        applicable. When in doubt, contact the MPF/MPS commander or telephone
        AFPC/DPWCM (DSN 665-3727 or 1-800-531-5501) for missing persons guidance.
        2.2.3.6. Explains the facts in detail if the absentee is wanted for another offense.
        2.2.3.7. If the unit commander wants the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI)
        assistance in finding the absentee, he/she must coordinate, and explain why, with the
        local AFOSI detachment for assistance.
     2.2.4. Notice to the next of kin and Payee of Allotments. The unit commander writes a
     Next-of-Kin Letter (Figure 2.2) to family members who receive allotments about the
     unauthorized absence (Table 1.1, step 4). The letters go to family members living in foreign
     countries as well as US residents.

            2.2.4.2.1. Military authorities do not know the member's whereabouts and believe the
            member is absent without authority (or a deserter, if appropriate).
            2.2.4.2.2. The next of kin should urge the member to return.
            2.2.4.2.3. If the next of kin knows the whereabouts of the member, they should
            immediately notify the nearest military installation law enforcement desk.
            2.2.4.2.4. Dependents will be ineligible for medical care, other benefits and
            privileges if the member’s status is, or changes to, deserter.
            2.2.4.2.5. The member's continued absence may lead to:
                2.2.4.2.5.1. Court martial.
                2.2.4.2.5.2. Loss of pay, allowance and government insurance.

                2.2.4.2.5.5. Confinement.
            2.2.4.2.6. The letter to family members who receive allotments must indicate that
            payments will stop if the unauthorized absence continues.
        2.2.4.3. The commander's letter to the dependents (or their guardian or other fiduciary)
        of an absentee with pay grade E-4 (with 4 years or less service) or below must state that
        they:
AFI36-2911 14 OCTOBER 2009                                                                   15


         2.2.4.3.1. May get temporary financial assistance, if they need it. The payment limit
         equals the basic allowance for quarters to which the absentee is entitled for no more
         than 2 consecutive months, if the absence lasts the entire period.
         2.2.4.3.2. May request the above referenced assistance when the member's absence

     2.2.5.2. Information given to military and civil law enforcement agencies to speed the
     absentee's return.
     2.2.5.3. Feedback from security forces contacts with civil law enforcement agencies.
  2.2.6. DD Form 553, Deserter/Absentee Wanted By The Armed Forces. The unit
  commander, with assistance from the MPF/MPS and AFPC/DPWCM if needed, prepares and
  distributes the DD Form 553 within 1 duty day of the decision to place member in deserter
  status (Table 1.1, step 3). Note: If the unit commander learns of any new information that
  could aid in the apprehension of the absentee, a new DD Form 553 must be completed and
  redistributed to all agencies included in the original distribution (Figure 2.5 and Attachment
  2). The DD Form 553 should be prepared for entry into the National Crime Information
  Center (NCIC) only when a member has been declared a deserter.
  2.2.7. Action in Cases Involving Security. Take these additional actions in cases involving
  national security matters. When an absentee is administratively classified as a deserter for a
  reason in paragraph 1.5.2, the unit commander takes the following actions:
     2.2.7.1. Refers the case for investigation to the AFOSI unit servicing the absentee's
     installation.
     2.2.7.2. As soon as possible, accounts for classified material that the absentee had access

     subsection 6-110, if the absentee had access to classified information.
  2.2.8. War and Mobilization Absence Without Leave (AWOL) Reporting Procedure. When
  Congress or the President declares an emergency, reporting procedures are accelerated to
  involve law enforcement agencies to assist in returning absent members to the military. If
  this occurs, immediately prepare and distribute DD Form 553 on the 10th day of AWOL, not
  the 31st day (see Table 1.1, note 7).

Dear Mrs. Doe


This letter is to inform you that your husband, Airman Basic John Doe, who is assigned to the
90th Communications Squadron, Randolph Air Force Base, Texas, has been absent without
authorization since 12 August 2003. Military authorities do not know Airman Doe’s
whereabouts and believe him to be a deserter.


If you are aware of Airman Doe’s whereabouts, I request that you urge him to return to duty and
ask that you immediately notify the nearest military installation law enforcement desk. If his
status is, or changes to, deserter, as Airman Doe’s dependent, you will be ineligible for medical
care, other benefits and privileges.
Please be advised that Airman Doe’s continued absence may lead to court-martial, loss of pay,
allowances, and government insurance, reduction in grade, a punitive discharge and or
confinement.
NOTE: Next paragraph required if member is E-4 (4 years or less).


As you can see, it is imperative that Airman Doe be located and that he return to duty
immediately. Please contact me at (210) 665-5890 if you have any questions or if I may be of
assistance.


                                                       Sincerely

                                           Chapter 3

  GENERAL APPREHENSION INFORMATION AND COOPERATION WITH CIVIL
                          AUTHORITIES

3.1. Apprehension Procedures. Commanders must start investigating the case and begin
apprehension efforts as soon as an unauthorized absence occurs. These efforts not only assists
return absentees to the military sooner, they also deter others from unauthorized absence.
3.2. Who Has Authority To Apprehend:
   3.2.1. Military law enforcement personnel and commissioned, warrant, petty, and non-
   commissioned officers may apprehend absentees and deserters. See Article 7, UCMJ, and
   Rules for Courts-Martial (RCM) 302(b)(1) and 302(b)(2). Commanders should consult the
   local SJA and SFS concerning apprehending authority.
   3.2.2. Civil officers authorized to arrest offenders under federal and state laws may arrest a
   deserter and deliver the offender into the custody of the Armed Forces (See Article 8 of the
   UCMJ and the RCM 302[b][3]). These officers may also arrest absentees at the request of
   military or federal authorities.
   3.2.3. United States authorities may arrest absentees and deserters in foreign countries only:
       3.2.3.1. When an international agreement with the country authorizes it.
       3.2.3.2. Under an agreement with appropriate local authorities that does not violate an
       existing international agreement.
       3.2.3.3. In these cases, carefully consider and consult with the servicing staff judge
       advocate (SJA) about possible international implications and adverse foreign relations.
       3.2.3.4. If apprehension is impossible, or in any case of unclear apprehension authority,
       report the facts either by fax: DSN 227-7861 or 703-695-7861, or message to the
       International and Operations Law Division, Office of The Judge Advocate General (HQ
       AF/JAO), to expedite submission to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for
       Manpower and Reserve Affairs for resolution.
3.3. Notice of Air Force Deserters to Civil Authorities:
   3.3.1. Within the Jurisdiction of the United States. The unit commander, working security
   forces and if needed the MPF/MPS, promptly sends DD Form 553 for a member
   administratively classified as a deserter to Armed Forces and civilian law enforcement
   agencies most likely to help apprehend the absentee.
       3.3.1.1. AFPC/DPWCM sends notices to HQ AFOSI and to the Department of State in
       certain cases (i.e., those in which others know or strongly suspect the absentee has gone
       to a foreign country).
   3.3.2. Outside the Jurisdiction of the United States. MAJCOMs act as needed respecting the
   primacy of international agreements to secure cooperation in apprehending absentee and/or
   deserted members.
26                                                               AFI36-2911 14 OCTOBER 2009


3.4. Investigations, Apprehension, and Cooperation with Civilian Law Enforcement
Authorities:
     3.4.1. Unit commanders must work closely with local security forces and OSI detachments
     to pursue every avenue possible to locate and ensure the apprehension of absentees. Leads
     developed as to the location of absentees shall be conveyed as expeditiously as possible to
     appropriate civilian law enforcement authorities who shall be asked to assist in the return of
     such persons to military control.
     3.4.2. In cases where the member has been dropped from unit rolls, AFPC/DPWCM and HQ
     AFOSI/ ICON will work together to resolve the case. HQ AFOSI/XOT and local field units
     will establish liaison and maintain a level of coordination with civilian law enforcement
     agencies necessary to encourage active participation in apprehension efforts.
     AFPC/DPWCM will provide any leads to HQ AFOSI/XOT for further pursuit.
     3.4.3. Absentees detained by civilian law enforcement authorities. In some cases,
     AFPC/DPWCM and/or HQ AFOSI/XOT may be the first Air Force agencies contacted by
     civilian law enforcement authorities regarding the apprehension of an Air Force deserter.
     AFPC/DPWCM will contact the nearest military installation within 1 duty day of the
     apprehension to expedite the absentee’s return to military control.
     3.4.4. Civilian law enforcement authorities arrest and hold absentees to assist military
     departments. The commander of the installation nearest where the absentee is being detained
     is responsible for taking custody of the absentee from civilian law enforcement authorities.
     3.4.5. Do not ask civilian law enforcement authorities to hold absentees longer than
     necessary. Make every attempt to pick up absentees within 48 hours after civilian law
     enforcement authorities agree to their release. Consult with the SJA if clarification is needed.
     3.4.6. If foreign authorities hold the absentee, consult with the SJA before acting.
     3.4.7. When a Service picks up absentees from civilian law enforcement authorities
     anywhere in the continental United States (CONUS), they pick up all such individuals at
     once, regardless of each member's military Service.
        3.4.7.1. Take absentees or deserters to the nearest military installation having facilities to
        process them.
     3.4.8. If the military Service cannot pick up all absentees or deserters held, they notify the
     other Services of the remaining individuals before leaving the confinement facility.
3.5. Rewards and Reimbursements:
     3.5.1. Any authorized communication, oral or written, from a military or federal law
     enforcement official or agency, requesting active cooperation in apprehending or delivering
     to military control an absentee or deserter wanted by a military department constitutes the
     basis for a reward. After this communication, the Air Force rewards or reimburses (but not
     both) persons or agencies apprehending, detaining or delivering absentees, deserters, escaped
     military prisoners, or parole violators to military control under Air Force Centrally Managed
     Allotment (CMA) Account 591.02. If a non-Air Force military absentee/deserter/escapee is
     brought to an Air Force installation and a reward or reimbursement is due, the apprehendee’s
     parent military department Military Personnel Pay Account pays, not the Air Force CMA.
     Reference AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, paragraph 12.7.5.
AFI36-2911 14 OCTOBER 2009                                                               27


     3.5.1.1. Fifty dollars for apprehending and holding absentees, deserters, or escaped
     military prisoners until military authorities take them.
     3.5.1.2. Seventy-five dollars for apprehending and delivering absentees, deserters, or
     escaped military prisoners to the military.
     3.5.1.3. Reimbursement for reasonable and actual expenses, not to exceed $75.00 per
     case, to persons or agencies prohibited from accepting rewards.
  3.5.2. To request reward or reimbursement, persons or agencies must submit DD Form 553
  to the financial services office where the deserter is returned to Air Force control. The
  remarks section of DD Form 553 must include the name, address and phone number for the
  persons or agencies requesting reward or reimbursement.
  3.5.3. Rewards, reimbursements and the cost of travel for guards assigned to absentees may
  be charged to the Air Force. The absentee does not reimburse the Service for these costs.

                                             Chapter 4

     ACTIONS TAKEN WHEN AN ABSENTEE RETURNS TO MILITARY CONTROL

4.1. Notice of Return to Military Control. The unit CSS, MPS, or commander at the Air
Force installation taking initial control of the absentee must notify AFPC/DPWCM (DSN 665-
3752 or 1-800-531-5501) within 1 duty day of the apprehension.
     4.1.1. IAW AFI 31-205, Air Force Corrections System, paragraph 1.3.9, installation
     commanders must maintain capabilities to house pre-trial detainees and sentenced inmates up
     to 1 year. This can be accomplished through an organic correctional facility, a HQ
     AFSFC/SFC coordinated/approved memorandum of agreement (MOA) with another
     correctional facility as described in AFI 31-205, paragraph 1.2.2.2.; or a combination of
     organic and MOA derived bed space. Installations with regional correctional facilities
     (RCFs) maintain the capability to house pre-trial detainees and sentenced inmates up to 15
     months. Installations having organic confinement facilities (CFs) implement programs
     according to AFI 31-205 and will ensure adequate operations and maintenance (O&M)
     funding.
4.2. Where Absentees Return to Military Control:
     4.2.1. At any military installation staffed by active duty personnel, immediately transfer an
     individual to the nearest installation of the individual's branch of military Service that has
     facilities to process absentees. Military authorities will take absentees and deserters being
     detained temporarily in the hands of civil authorities into custody within 48 hours after
     receiving notification of the absentee’s or deserter’s place of detention.
     4.2.2. In foreign countries, military attachés, the chief of the Military Assistance Advisory
     Group (MAAG), or similar organizations, may not help an absentee who asks to return to
     military control unless the US is directly responsible for the individual's presence in the
     country.
        4.2.2.1. Generally, these organizations advise such absentees to report, at their own
        expense, to a proper US military installation in the US or overseas.
        4.2.2.2. Unless absentees are citizens of the country in which US assistance is requested,
        they must be reported to the country’s proper authorities with a view toward deportation.
        4.2.2.3. If the individual leaves or is deported from the foreign country, the military
        attaché or chief of the MAAG arranges for the individual's custody upon arriving in a
        territory where US military officers have arresting authority.
     4.2.3. In the absence of other specific arrangements among military Service commands,
     when one of the military Services makes a pickup of absentees and deserters from civil
     authorities anywhere in the continental United States, all such individuals, regardless of their
     military Service, shall be picked up at the same time and delivered to the nearest military
     installation having facilities to process absentees or deserters. When such a multi-Service
     pickup is not possible, the military authority making a limited pickup shall notify the military
     Service(s) of the individuals remaining in civilian custody, preferably before leaving the
     civilian confinement facility.
AFI36-2911 14 OCTOBER 2009                                                                       29


4.3. Defining an Absentee’s Return to Military Control. An absentee in the hands of civilian
law enforcement authorities is no longer considered to be at large when Air Force authorities
lodge a detainer with civil authorities. A detainer is a written or verbal request to hold the
member for Air Force authorities when his or her presence is no longer required by civilian law
enforcement authorities. The detainer ensures civilian law enforcement authorities will inform
military authorities when they are ready to release the absentee.
   4.3.1. An absentee’s return to military control occurs at the date and hour that:
       4.3.1.1. An absentee surrenders to, is delivered to, or is apprehended by military
       authorities.
       4.3.1.2. A civilian law enforcement authority informs the military that it holds the
       absentee for some reason other than the military's request.
       4.3.1.3. An absentee otherwise comes under the control of military personnel.
4.4. Return to the Air Force at Other than the Unit of Assignment:
   4.4.1. Disposition instructions:
       4.4.1.1. Absentees gone for less than 1 year will be returned to the unit they were
       assigned to at the time of their unauthorized absence.
          4.4.1.1.1. IAW AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, paragraph 12.7.4,
          the Air Force may furnish military personnel who are in an absent-without-leave,
          desertion, or escaped-military-prisoner status (under apprehension) the necessary
          transportation and meal tickets to return to their duty station or other place directed by
          competent authority. The travel and expenses of the apprehended member are funded
          by the Military Personnel CMA account. The detaining unit will cut a one-way TDY
          order or memorandum for the deserter (AFI 65-103, Temporary Duty Orders, table
          2.1 and Appendix H of the Joint Federal Travel Regulation). In Block 16, Remarks,
          type the following statement: ―Member is a deserter returned to military control.‖
          4.4.1.1.2. For deserters who do not require escorts, the detaining security forces unit
          will issue a DD Form 460, Provisional Pass, and the member will travel to their duty
          station.
          4.4.1.1.3. For deserters requiring escorts, do not release the deserter except to
          identified escorts. See paragraph 4.5 for escort delineation.
       4.4.1.2. Members absent for 1 year or more will stay at the nearest Air Force installation
       with facilities for handling of the case.
   4.4.2. For members in a PCS status, refer to Table 4.1.
   4.4.3. The detaining unit sends an email notifying AFPC/DPWCM of the return of a deserter
   to military control.
   4.4.4. In some cases, the rules outlined above may not be appropriate. Under these
   circumstances, contact AFPC/DPWCM (DSN 665-3727 or 1-800-531-5501) for further
   guidance.
4.5. Escorts. The action unit commander coordinates with security forces to see if absentees
need escorts. Use security forces escorts only when an armed escort is needed as determined by
30                                                               AFI36-2911 14 OCTOBER 2009


the installation chief, Security Forces. Prisoners not considered to be a threat to themselves or
the general public can be escorted by unarmed personnel such as supervisors and first sergeants.
The commander authorizes escorts for members detained outside their country of assignment
only after consulting the servicing SJA.
     4.5.1. Generally, use escorts if the member:
        4.5.1.1. Escaped from prison.
        4.5.1.2. Has been charged with other serious offenses.
        4.5.1.3. Was apprehended by civil authorities.
        4.5.1.4. Is a repeat offender.
        4.5.1.5. Has a history of disciplinary infractions.
     4.5.2. To ensure the absentee’s prompt return, on-duty escorts must not take leave or delay
     en route.
     4.5.3. Charge transportation requests (TRs) and meal tickets furnished to Air Force
     personnel acting as escorts of Air Force absentees, deserters or escaped military prisoners to
     the Air Force CMA account P-591.03. Do not charge these expenses against the pay of the
     returned Air Force member. Reference AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance and Procedures,
     paragraph 12.8.1.
     4.5.4. When the Air Force escorts return Army personnel from an Air Force installation,
     charge the TRs and meal tickets furnished to the escorts to the MilPERS appropriation,
     Army. Obtain full Department of Army accounting classification from Army fiscal codes,
     the nearest Army installation, Army headquarters, or the home organization of the Army
     absentees, deserters, or escapees. Reference AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance and
     Procedures, paragraph 12.8.2.
4.6. Actions Taken After An Absentee is Returned to a Servicing Air Force Installation .
The following items are an integral part of an absentee’s return to the Air Force:
     4.6.1. Notification of return of deserter to the military. Note: The unit CSS or unit
     commander with the assistance from the MPF/MPS commander will notify AFPC/DPWCM
     via email within 1 duty day of the member’s return to military control. Email:
     AFPC/DPWCM.AWOL/DESERTER@RANDOLPH.AF.MIL
     4.6.2. DD Form 616, Report of Return of Absentee (Note: The DD Form 616 is completed
     only when a DD Form 553 has been completed). The unit commander, with MPF/MPS
     assistance, completes and distributes DD Form 616 (Figure 4.2 and Attachment 3) to all the
     agencies that received DD Form 553 within 1 duty day of the member’s return to military
     control. Note: AFPC/DPWCM requires a data faxed copy (Fax: DSN 665-4757 or 210-565-
     4757). File original DD Form 616 in member’s FPRG. AFPC/DPWCM will data fax DD
     Form 616 to HQ AFOSI/XOT.
     4.6.3. HQ AFOSI/XOT will remove the member’s name from the NCIC upon receipt of the
     DD Form 616 and when AFPC/DPWCM receives notification from the unit commander or
     the MPF/MPS confirming the member’s return to military control.
AFI36-2911 14 OCTOBER 2009                                                                    31


   4.6.4. The unit CSS, commander, or MPF/MPS prepares the Duty Status Change Request
   using CMS. Select HR Type PPA-Duty Status Change (AWOL/Deserter) and forward to the
   commander for approval within 1 duty day after member’s returned to military control. The
   commander forwards the HR Type PPA-Duty Status Change (AWOL/Deserter) to
   AFPC/DPWCM for processing within 1 duty day of receipt.
       4.6.4.1. AFPC/DPWCM conducts a quality review of HR Type PPA-Duty Status Change
       (AWOL/Deserter) CMS case, updates MilPDS and forwards CMS case to Total Force
       Service Center for further processing.
   4.6.5. If the returned member has been dropped from unit rolls (a deserter for 180 days or
   more), the member’s duty status and PAS Code will be updated by AFPC/DPWCM. Once
   this transaction has been completed in MilPDS and the unit commander, CSS, or MPF/MPS
   completes a HR Type PPA-Duty Status Change (AWOL/Deserter) CMS case and
   AFPC/DPWCM will update MilPDS accordingly.
       4.6.5.1. If the absentee has been dropped from the unit rolls (after 180 days of desertion
       status), AFPC/DPWCM will forward the deserters medical and dental records to the unit
       CSS after the deserter is gained to an Air Force unit.
4.7. Commander's Determination. The action unit commander:
   4.7.1. Takes responsibility for disposition of unauthorized absence.
   4.7.2. Decides whether the absence was avoidable or unavoidable.
   4.7.3. Uses guidance in the Department of Defense (DoD) Military Pay and Allowances
   Entitlements Manual (DoD Pay Manual), tables 1.1.2 and 1-3-3.
   4.7.4. Uses AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program, and DFAS 7900.4-G, Federal
   Requirements for Financial Managment Systems, to tell when to charge leave for an absence
   excused as unavoidable.
   4.7.5. A commander who finds that an absence was:
       4.7.5.1. Avoidable, takes appropriate disciplinary action if warranted. Consult with SJA.
       4.7.5.2. Unavoidable, excuses it. The absence does not count as lost time to be made
       good. Charge it to leave if it is not authorized for another reason. A new HR type PPA
       AWOL/Deserter CMS case revokes the unauthorized absence report. Examples of
       excused absences not charged to leave include:
          4.7.5.2.1. When a member's lack of mental capacity causes the absence.
          4.7.5.2.2. When civilian law enforcement authorities hold, try and acquit a member.
   4.7.6. If a member dies during an unauthorized absence, the commander of the unit of
   assignment makes a new status determination. After considering all available facts, the
   commander must determine if the member was in duty status, absent on leave, absent without
   leave, or a deserter (DoD Pay Manual, paragraph 40505).
   4.7.7. See table 4.1 for other dispositions.
4.8. Erroneous Reports of Unauthorized Absence. When a commander finds an erroneous
report of unauthorized absence, the unit CSS or MPF/MPS destroys all records of it. No trace of
32                                                           AFI36-2911 14 OCTOBER 2009


the entries of the alleged unauthorized absence may remain in the FPRG or the Master Personnel
Record.
     4.8.1. If DD Forms 553 and 616 were distributed, another DD Form 616 must be
     accomplished and fully explain the error in item 9, remarks section.
     4.8.2. The commander sends new letters explaining the error to the next of kin, dependents,

   address.
   5.2.2. Contact the office issuing the orders to determine if proof exists.

to determine if substantial proof of delivery of orders exist before taking any unauthorized
absence action. The unit of assignment completes appropriate actions outlined in chapter 2.

A4.1. The offenses below warrant the assistance of civilian law enforcement resources, under

includes striking a superior commissioned officer; however, the list does not include willfully
disobeying a lawful command of a superior commissioned officer during peacetime, also an
offense under Article 90. In certain circumstances, especially involving offenses for which the
maximum punishment is equal to or greater than 10 years’ confinement, or where other serious
government interests are at stake, other offenses may warrant a determination of desertion under
aggravated circumstances. Consult with the servicing staff judge advocate for further guidance.
