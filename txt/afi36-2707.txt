Section A—General Information

1. Air Force Nondiscrimination Policy.
     1.1. Air Force Nondiscrimination Policy. It is Air Force policy that no person shall be
     excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination on the
     basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetic information
     (except as prescribed by statute or policy consistent with statute) under any program or
     activity either conducted by the Air Force, or receiving Federal financial assistance disbursed
     by the Air Force.
     1.2. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VI, provides that no person in the United States
     shall, on the basis of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, denied
     the benefits of, or otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity
     receiving Federal assistance.
     1.3. DoD Directive 5500.11, Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs, 27 May

        Defense, 31 March 1982, is the basic implementing directive for DoD compliance with
        the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 504. Individual discrimination complaints by Air
        Force appropriated and non-appropriated fund employees or applicants for employment
        concerning employment issues and alleging violations of section 504 of the
        Rehabilitation Act of 1973 are processed under the procedures outlined in AFI 36-2706.
     1.4. This instruction implements Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended,
     Section 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and DoD Directives 5500.11, 27 May

     Amendments of 1972, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, and other applicable law or
     regulation.
     1.5. The Air Force will conduct its affairs free from unlawful discrimination. It provides
     equal opportunity for all members irrespective of race, color, religion, sex, national origin,
     age, disability, or genetic information (except as prescribed by statute or policy consistent
     with statute).

   1.6. Whenever unlawful discrimination practices are found, the Air Force will immediately
   take action to address the inequities and ensure channels are available to air complaints
   without fear of reprisal.
   1.7. This instruction establishes, and outlines guidance prohibiting discrimination based on
   race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetic information in the
   Department of the Air Force. It applies to programs either receiving Federal financial

       complainants shall not be disclosed except when necessary to carry out the purpose of
       this instruction, including the conduct of investigations, hearings or judicial proceedings.
       2.1.2. Use of Illegal Drugs. This instruction does not prohibit discrimination against an
       individual based on that individual's current illegal use of drugs.
   2.2. Provide a person any service, aid, or other benefit that is different from and not
   equivalent to that provided to others under the program, unless such action is necessary to
