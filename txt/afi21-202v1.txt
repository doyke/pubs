                                            Chapter 1

      MISSILE MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY AND GUIDANCE

1.1. Air Force Instruction (AFI) 21-200, Munitions and Missile Maintenance. AFI 21-200
contains general information to support Air Force munitions and missile maintenance and
provides broad responsibilities for these organizations. This AFI is the capstone document that
defines munitions organizational structure and related roles and responsibilities and is supported
by a family of 21-2XX series instructions, which includes AFI 21-202.
1.2. Introduction. This instruction prescribes specific missile maintenance guidance and
procedures and provides senior leadership and management direction for the accomplishment of
this mission. This AFI refers to the ICBM maintenance.
1.3. Supervision of Maintenance. All levels of supervision must place emphasis on safety,
security, quality and timeliness in the performance of maintenance.
1.4. Missile and Equipment Readiness. Missile and equipment readiness is the maintenance
mission. Maintenance ensures assigned missile and support equipment are safe, serviceable and
properly configured to meet mission needs. Maintenance actions include, but are not limited to,
certification, inspection, repair, overhaul, modification, preservation, refurbishment, testing and
analyzing condition and performance.
     1.4.1. Manage nuclear-certified equipment, software, vehicles, and end items identified in
     USAF                Master            Nuclear               Certification             List
     (https://wwwmil.nwc.kirtland.af.mil/MNCL/index.cfm) per AFI 63-125, Nuclear
     Certification Program.
1.5. Preventive Maintenance. The purpose of the entire maintenance process is to sustain a
capability to support operational mission requirements. To accomplish this objective, the
primary focus of the maintenance effort should be on preventive rather than corrective
maintenance. Preventive (or scheduled) maintenance ensures equipment is ready and available
at the time of need. A conscientious and disciplined approach to preventive maintenance will be
the method used to meet that goal safely and effectively. Preventive maintenance concepts are
described in Technical Order (TO) 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection,

     ICBM MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT SUPERVISORY RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. ICBM Maintenance Management. ICBM and equipment readiness is the maintenance
mission. All maintenance actions and management efforts must be directed towards the support
of the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) requirements. The maintenance
function ensures assigned ICBMs and equipment are safe, serviceable and properly configured to
meet mission needs. Maintenance actions include, but are not limited to, inspection, repair,
overhaul, modification, preservation, refurbishment, testing, analyzing condition and
performance. All levels of supervision must place emphasis on safety, quality and timeliness in
the performance of maintenance. All maintenance supervisors are mandated to use all resources
in the most effective and efficient way with emphasis on the safety and welfare of technicians.
To the maximum extent possible, maintenance is to be accomplished on a preplanned, scheduled
basis. This planning provides the most effective and efficient use of people, facilities and
equipment, reduces unscheduled maintenance, and allows for progressive actions toward
maintaining and returning ICBMs and equipment to safe operating condition. Maintenance
activities will ensure complete, quality maintenance and absolute compliance with technical data,
safety and security standards.
     2.1.1. Weapon System:
        2.1.1.1. Remove missiles from alert status to perform maintenance actions that prevent
        progressive degradation of missile systems or to perform tests prescribed in TOs and
        higher headquarters' directives and instructions. When practical, a scheduled off alert
        will be planned to align with other maintenance requiring the sortie to be scheduled off
        alert. Technicians must correct detected discrepancies on-the-spot if within their
        capability and available time (T-3) and document uncorrected discrepancies (T-2).
        2.1.1.2. Configuration management of facilities and equipment will be emphasized at all
        levels of management.
     2.1.2. Safety:
        2.1.2.1. Use unit plans/supplements to clearly establish specific roles and responsibilities
        of maintenance personnel during missile or nuclear mishaps (Missile Potential Hazard
        (MPH), Propulsion System Rocket Engine (PSRE)/Post Boost Control System (PBCS)
        response, Nuclear Weapon Accident/Incident response, etc.) and disaster control
        situations. Coordinate plans/supplements through unit safety, 20 AF/SE/A4 and
        applicable MAJCOM logistics division. (T-2)
        2.1.2.2. The Missile Combat Crew (MCC) is in command of the launch facility (LF) at
        all times regardless of its status. The MCC has full authority to prohibit commencement
        and direct termination of any task. The maintenance Team Chief is responsible for the
        safe operation of the missile system in the LF once the LF is penetrated and lock pin
        assembly is installed in the safety control switch. The team chief has full authority to
        prohibit commencement and direct termination of any task.
        2.1.2.3. Comply with the maximum duty periods and minimum rest periods for all
        personnel assigned to a maintenance activity IAW AFI 21-200
AFI21-202V1 17 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                 9


     2.1.2.4. When a critical safety deficiency is discovered and it can be reasonably assumed
     this condition may exist on other equipment of the same type and model, the reporting
     activity will submit a deficiency report IAW TO 00-35D-54. The reporting activity will
     inspect like equipment for the same deficiency as soon as possible and submit a follow-
     on deficiency report.
  2.1.3. Workload Requirements:
     2.1.3.1. Plans and Scheduling Section will utilize teams provided to build schedules
     which maximize maintenance effectiveness. Squadron Maintenance Operations Officer
     (MOO)/Superintendent (MX SUPT) will ensure the most efficient use of maintenance
     resources. Once schedules are finalized (daily schedule must be final the day prior and
     the weekly schedule must be final by Friday the week prior), any schedule changes lower
     than a priority 1 require approval by Maintenance Group (MXG)/CC or designee (T-3).
     Any changes to posted schedules from Base Civil Engineer (BCE) must be coordinated
     with Missile Maintenance Operations Center (MMOC) (T-3).
     2.1.3.2. Long-term hardware condition depends on regular periodic maintenance and a
     viable program to clear discrepancies.
     2.1.3.3. The periodic maintenance program must ensure the performance of all Dash 6
     Requirements as well as the full spectrum of facilities maintenance (T-2). The intent is to
     integrate all periodic maintenance efforts. This window of opportunity should capitalize
     on clearing as many Work-Order Requirements File (WRF) discrepancies as possible. If
     periodic maintenance is not accomplished during other site penetrations (i.e. 3-year
     periodic maintenance cycle) annual and biennial periodic maintenance requirements will
     be completed, to the maximum extent possible, during annual code change (T-3).
     2.1.3.4. Enter all missile-related BCE discrepancies into Integrated Maintenance Data
     System (IMDS) (T-2). In addition, communication-related discrepancies will be entered
     into IMDS to requisition supplies, schedule maintenance actions, document maintenance
     actions and maintenance training (T-2). Refer to maintenance Technical Order 00-20
     series publications for maintenance documentation procedures.
  2.1.4. The maintenance goal is to perform weapon system maintenance during a scheduled
  12-hour daylight shift following the rules established in Table 2.1. Ideally, teams should be
  scheduled for 12 dispatches per month.
  2.1.5. Management:
     2.1.5.1. Limit documentation requirements to those essential for maintenance
     management effectiveness.
     2.1.5.2. MCCs may perform locally specified maintenance tasks in the Launch Control
     Centers (LCCs). MXG/CC and OG/CC must approve the specified maintenance tasks
     (T-3).
     2.1.5.3. Security Forces may perform critical emergency maintenance tasks as directed
     by the MMOC (T-3). Emergency maintenance tasks are defined as environmental
     control system resets and standby power system resets that would result in damage to
     equipment if not accomplished in minimum time. MMOC will request Security
     Response Team (SRT) support through the MCC at the parent Missile Alert Facility
10                                                     AFI21-202V1 17 SEPTEMBER 2014


     (MAF) (T-3). These tasks must be specifically authorized and under direct control of the
     MMOC (T-3).
  2.1.6. Emergency War Order (EWO) Program. At all ICBM bases, other than Vandenberg
  AFB, the normal day-to-day maintenance activities that contribute to achieving, maintaining,
  or enhancing alert posture are, in fact EWO activities. Thus, all Non-Mission Capable
  (NMC) and Partially Mission Capable (PMC) maintenance at operational bases is EWO
  maintenance. Advanced DEFCON maintenance is merely an acceleration of day-to-day
  EWO maintenance. EWO Essential Maintenance is repair actions required to generate or
  enhance the alert posture of missiles and enhance the launch capability of LCCs. For Priority
  1-4 maintenance during advanced DEFCONs, the MXG/CC must consider the tradeoffs of
  temporary degrades in hardness/capability caused by performing Priority 1-4 maintenance as
  opposed to not performing the maintenance (T-3). In-shop EWO essential maintenance
  encompasses those repair actions required to support the generation effort during advanced
  DEFCONs. Maintenance personnel must know their responsibilities in the unit's EWO role.
     2.1.6.1. One-Time/Annual EWO Familiarization Training requirements are found in
     Attachment 3: A3.18 EWO Familiarization Training.
  2.1.7. Technical Data. Use of the prescribed technical data to maintain the ICBM weapon
  system and support equipment is mandatory IAW AFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle
  Management (T-1). Use is defined as available and in-use, in the immediate work area.
     2.1.7.1. When performing nuclear weapons handling tasks, teams will verify and check-
     off steps as they are performed IAW AFI 21-204, Nuclear Weapons Maintenance
     Management (T-1). For ICBM RS mate/demate and handling tasks, the tasks that are to

 NOTES:
 1. The Maintenance Group Commander has the authority to work lower priorities over higher
 priorities to meet mission requirements consistent with safety and security. (T-3)
 2. Shop maintenance required to repair items needed to clear site discrepancies will carry the
 priority of the site discrepancy if repair is not adequately covered elsewhere in this attachment.
 (T-2)
 3. For minor hardware hardness discrepancies not expected to be a degraded condition, classify
 as a Priority 5. (T-2)
 4. Be consistent when prioritizing like discrepancies. (T-3)
 5. The following are guidelines to assist MMOC and Materiel Control determine UJCs:
 5.1. For initial requests of items from base supply, use UJC AA.(T-2)
 5.2. For backordered items, use the following UJCs:
 5.3. Supplies required to correct a red X condition, use UJC 1A. The lack of the item(s)
 prevents mission accomplishment because the end item is not operationally ready, out of
 commission or inoperative. These are MICAP conditions. (T-2)
 5.4. Supplies required to correct red W conditions, use UJC JA Lack of the requested item(s)
 impairs primary mission accomplishment because the end item is not fully equipped or is
 operating in a limited or restricted capacity. These are MICAP conditions. (T-2)

 5.5. Supplies required to correct red diagonal conditions, use UJC BQ. The item required is
 one that impairs assigned combat/support mission or tasks of the force/activity involved. Also
 use when the training for such missions and tasks can be accomplished but with decreased
 effectiveness and efficiency. These are delayed discrepancies. (T-2)
 6. The maintenance priority designator for an outage affecting the command and control
 communications at multiple sites should be elevated to reflect the higher maintenance priority of
 the communications outage. Contact MMOC for determination.
 7. Additional maintenance in conjunction with periodic maintenance will be treated as a P3 for
 resource allocation (e.g. SF support, vehicles, support equipment, etc.) even though the
 individual work orders may be a lower priority.

             Hardened Intersite Cable Right-of-Way Landowner/Tenant Questionnaire, to
 118                                                     AFI21-202V1 17 SEPTEMBER 2014


                  gather public information. See AFI 33-324, The Information Collections and
                  Reports Management Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency
                  Air Force Information Collections, for more guidance on requesting
                  information from the public.
              A4.1.3.3.1.5. Notify landowners or tenants in advance with details of any planned
              cable work on their property. In all cases where digging takes place, make every
              effort to contact the landowner. (T-3)
              A4.1.3.3.1.6. Ensure all non-routine maintenance of the ROW (i.e., erosion repair
              work, earth moving, cable lowering or relocation, etc.) is monitored and
              inspected. (T-3)
       A4.1.3.4. ROW Maintenance.
           A4.1.3.4.1. Deficiencies. The HICS ROW is USAF Real Property. Correction of
           deficiencies is a BCE responsibility. However, the CAO is the single point of contact
           for all ROW deficiencies and ensures corrective actions are implemented (T-3). The
           CAO will:
              A4.1.3.4.1.1. Inspect all ROW problems (erosion, access/gate discrepancies, etc.)
              and determine corrective actions according to TO 21M-LGM30F-2-20-1 and/or
              applicable drawings (T-3).
              A4.1.3.4.1.2. Coordinate with cable maintenance to either perform repairs or
              monitor BCE/contractor efforts as required. (T-3)
              A4.1.3.4.1.3. Request BCE assistance, as required (T-3). If BCE cannot support
              the ROW repair with in-house resources, the CAO processes a BCE funded AF
              IMT 9, Request for Purchase, for contract support (T-3).
NOTE: At bases where the missile wing is a tenant, BCE funding/reimbursement for missile support
actions is according to local support agreement. The CAO must submit annual requirements to BCE
well in advance for funding and programming. When out-of-cycle funding is necessary, the request
and justification must be submitted to BCE for joint resolution.

       A4.1.3.5. ROW Projects.
           A4.1.3.5.1. The CAO provides annual funding requirements for ROW projects,
           excluding ROW (HICS) gate projects, requiring contract support to the
           communications unit budget officer. These fund requirements are included in the
           yearly financial plans, Program Element Code (PEC) 11323F, under Electronic
           Equipment and Inter/Intra Site Cable Maintenance Element of Expense Identification
           Code (EEIC) funds. Based on these estimates, HQ AFGSC/A4A6XB allocates funds
           for specific projects as they occur. The expenses generated by reimbursable projects
           are paid from funds predeposited by the crossing agency in Deposit Fund Account
           57F3875 (see reimbursements in paragraph A6.1.3.6.4.2).
           A4.1.3.5.2. The CAO coordinates unprogrammed project requirements with unit and
           base budget       offices to immediately notify HQ AFGSC/A4N and HQ
           AFGSC/A4A6XB. HQ AFGSC/A4A6XB will fund validated projects on a case-by-
           case basis. (T-1)
AFI21-202V1 17 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                        119


           A4.1.3.5.3. The CAO requests depot level support in accordance with TO 00-25-107,
           Maintenance Assistance, when repair/project requirements are beyond base level
           capabilities. (T-3)
       A4.1.3.6. HICS ROW Crossings.
           A4.1.3.6.1. The CAO ensures the HICS is not endangered by ROW crossing or
           construction activity (T-3). Crossings divide into three distinct categories:
               A4.1.3.6.1.1. Crossings where the government has lesser easement rights
               (secondary or later).
               A4.1.3.6.1.2. Crossings where the government has superior easement rights (first
               or prior).
               A4.1.3.6.1.3. Crossings within the confines of a public ROW where the
               government was issued a license or permit for the cable installation.
           A4.1.3.6.2. Future Crossings: When notified of a future crossing, the CAO and base
           Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) must initially determine who has the superior easement.
           In all cases, the USAF must comply with the terms of the easement. When the
           question of superior easement determination cannot be resolved, the CAO forwards
           all supporting case documents to applicable MAJCOM logistics division for
           resolution (T-1). At the same time, the CAO must obtain sufficient details from the
           crossing agency to determine what actions, if any, are necessary to protect the HICS
           (T-3).
NOTE: When the CAO knows of other crossing agency plans to cross the ROW but has not been
properly contacted, the CAO must take the initiative to contact that party. If the crossing agency
refuses to submit the required request, the CAO must immediately advise appropriate MAJCOM
logistics division and the base SJA of the potential legal problem.

           A4.1.3.6.3. Crossings without Government Superior Easement Rights (Lesser).
           Required actions depend on whether HIC lowering or relocation is required due to the
           crossing activity.
               A4.1.3.6.3.1. If no cable lowering or relocating is required, the CAO:
                   A4.1.3.6.3.1.1. Advises the crossing agency that:
                     A4.1.3.6.3.1.1.1. The CAO must be notified 72 hours before work begins.
                     A4.1.3.6.3.1.1.2. Crossing work must be restricted to coordinated locations.
                     A4.1.3.6.3.1.1.3. Intentionally severing the HICS is a criminal offense and
                     could result in legal actions according to United States Code.
                     A4.1.3.6.3.1.1.4. Repair costs for negligent severing or damage to the HICS
                     will be billed to the crossing agency.
                   A4.1.3.6.3.1.2. Schedules cable teams to locate and stake the cable in the
                   crossing area and monitor the crossing work. Always attempt to place the
                   cable team on-site to satisfy the time and date requirements of the crossing
                   agency. (T-3)
 120                                                      AFI21-202V1 17 SEPTEMBER 2014


               A4.1.3.6.3.2. Cable lowering or relocating must be accomplished by USAF
               resources (in-house or contracted agent) at government expense (T-1). Under no
               circumstances will the crossing agency lower or relocate the cable (T-1). The
               CAO coordinates and oversees the effort (T-3). If MMXS lacks resources to
               perform the work, the CAO seeks assistance in the following order:
                  A4.1.3.6.3.2.1. To the maximum extent possible, BCE resources will be used
                  for ROW work (T-3). The CAO must coordinate with BCE for specific
                  equipment, operator and time requirements (T-3).
                  A4.1.3.6.3.2.2. Contract support with EEIC Funds. The CAO arranges for
                  the lease or rental of equipment and operators as required.
NOTE: Contact cable maintenance for assistance as required.

           A4.1.3.6.4. Crossings with Government Superior Easement Rights. Before the
           USAF permits any agency to cross the HICS, that agency must ask for consent-to-
           cross (T-1). The agency must agree to the reimbursement procedures, when
           applicable, before the crossing can begin. CAOs can grant conditional crossing
           consents if no problems are encountered and crossing restrictions are observed (T-2).
NOTE: Following conditional consent refer to paragraph A4.1.3.6.4.3. for permanent consent
procedures. Consent-to-cross notification, reimbursement, issuance and follow-on procedures are
outlined below:

               A4.1.3.6.4.1. Notification. The CAO must advise the crossing agency, by letter,
               of the following:
                  A4.1.3.6.4.1.1. They cannot cross the ROW where the USAF has the superior
                  easement except in a manner not involving physical or electronic interference
                  with the HIC (T-1).
                  A4.1.3.6.4.1.2. They must provide details of their planned activity so the
                  CAO can determine whether HIC lowering or relocation is required (T-1).
                  A4.1.3.6.4.1.3. Any requirement to relocate the cable to preclude interference
                  from crossing agency’s crossings will be done by the USAF at the crossing
                  agency’s expense. Include reimbursement procedures in the letter. (T-1)
               A4.1.3.6.4.2. Reimbursement. Where the USAF has superior easement rights
               and must lower or relocate the HICS cable due to the crossing agency’s activity,
               the crossing agency must reimburse the USAF (T-1). In these cases, the
               reimbursement procedures in AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and
               Procedures, apply (T-1). The CAO:
                  A4.1.3.6.4.2.1. Provides reimbursement details to the crossing agency
                  explaining they must pre-deposit sufficient funds to cover the cost, payable to
                  the local Defense Accounting Office (DAO), deposit fund account 57F3875
                  (T-1). Also, advises the party that they must pay any claims filed as a result
                  of activity associated with the crossing (T-1).
                  A4.1.3.6.4.2.2. Provides a cost estimate to the crossing agency (T-1), with at
AFI21-202V1 17 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                         121


             least the following cost breakouts:
               A4.1.3.6.4.2.2.1. Military man-hours (by grade).
               A4.1.3.6.4.2.2.2. Civilian man-hours (by grade).
               A4.1.3.6.4.2.2.3. Material required (standard cost).
               A4.1.3.6.4.2.2.4. Commercial equipment required (number of hours, type).
               A4.1.3.6.4.2.2.5. Travel.

               A4.1.3.6.4.2.2.7. Other (with description).
               A4.1.3.6.4.2.2.8. Ensures the cost estimate letter clearly states that the
               crossing agency must provide additional pre-deposits if actual expenditures
               exceed the estimate. Pre-deposit must be made before work commences.
          A4.1.3.6.4.3. Issuance. When the crossing agency has requested consent-to-cross
          and has agreed to the reimbursement procedures, the CAO notifies the BCE real
          estate office by letter (T-3). The letter must identify the specific easements
          involved and request the BCE real estate office issue a consent-to-cross to the
          crossing agency with at least the following provisions stated:
             A4.1.3.6.4.3.1. Crossing criteria (T-1).
             A4.1.3.6.4.3.2. Reimbursement details, as provided by CAO (when
             applicable). (T-1)
             A4.1.3.6.4.3.3. A statement that any USAF work (lowering or relocation)
             must be complete before the crossing agency crosses the easement. (T-1)
             A4.1.3.6.4.3.4. The requirement for the crossing agency to notify the CAO at
             least 48 hours in advance of their crossing. (T-1)
             A4.1.3.6.4.3.5. Liability for damages. (T-1)
             A4.1.3.6.4.3.6. If the USAF relocates the cable, the crossing agency must
             purchase, in the name of th5 USAF, any additional ROW needed (T-1). At no
             time will the USAF relinquish its superior easement rights to facilitate
             highway or utility construction (T-1). Purchase of additional ROW in the
             name of the USAF must include the necessary environmental analyses
             required by AFI 32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis Process, and
             environmental baseline studies required by AFI 32-9003, Granting Temporary
             Use of Air Force Real Property (T-1).
          A4.1.3.6.4.4. Follow-on Actions. Record day-to-day expenditures associated
          with the project (T-3). Coordinate with base DAO to ensure funds are available
          for project completion (T-3). In no case may expenditures continue prior to
          availability of funds to cover the expenses (T-1).
             A4.1.3.6.4.4.1. Forward requests for additional predeposits, as necessary, to
             the crossing agency with an information copy to the base DAO. (T-2)
             A4.1.3.6.4.4.2. Compute the total project cost after completion. The final
 122                                                       AFI21-202V1 17 SEPTEMBER 2014


                   cost accounting must substantiate the transfer of funds from deposit fund
                   account 57F3875 to reimburse the following appropriations:
                     A4.1.3.6.4.4.2.1. General Accounting and Finance in accordance with
                     DOD7000.14-R, Volume 1, General Financial Management Information,
                     Systems and Requirements, April 2001.
                     A4.1.3.6.4.4.2.2. Civilian Pay in accordance with DOD 7000.14-R, Volume
                     8, Civilian Pay Policy and Procedures, February 2002.
                     A4.1.3.6.4.4.2.3. Material consumed - standard cost.
                     A4.1.3.6.4.4.2.4. Commercial equipment used charged as billed.
                     A4.1.3.6.4.4.2.5. Travel costs.
                   A4.1.3.6.4.4.3. Forward a copy of the final computation to the base DAO for
                   final resolution of the predeposit fund. Also send a copy to the crossing
                   agency. (T-1)
                   A4.1.3.6.4.4.4. Retain a copy of the final reimbursement computation and all
                   supporting documentation. Obtain copies of collection and disbursement
                   documentation from the base DAO. (T-1)
NOTE: Process reimbursements in a similar manner if the crossing agency is another Government
agency other than USAF. In this case, reimbursable expenses are limited to civilian pay, material,
travel and contractual services.

       A4.1.3.7. ROW Procurement.
           A4.1.3.7.1. The CAO submits requests to the BCE Real Estate Office to acquire
           additional ROW. (T-3)
           A4.1.3.7.2. These requests contain legal descriptions, maps, and information on the
           real estate required and the date the CAO must receive notification of the new ROW
           acquisition.
NOTE: Purchase of additional ROW must include the necessary environmental analyses required by
AFI 32-7061 and environmental baseline studies required by AFI 32-9003.

       A4.1.3.8. Claims.
           A4.1.3.8.1. When a damage claim is anticipated, the CAO provides the SJA details
           of possible damage to private property caused by USAF personnel and/or contractors
           performing USAF related duties on or off the HICS ROW. (T-1)
           A4.1.3.8.2. Take color photographs of evidence and provide them to the base SJA
           when possible. The CAO advises/assists the SJA as required. (T-3)
       A4.1.3.9. Project/Case Files.
           A4.1.3.9.1. The CAO establishes project/case files to maintain any actions,
           documents and photographs pertaining to all HICS crossings, projects or ROW
           problems. (T-3)
AFI21-202V1 17 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                              123


        A4.1.3.9.2. Maintain copies of all reimbursement billing documents for future
        reference should auditing or legal actions occur (T-1). Refer to AFMAN 33-363 and
        the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).
     A4.1.3.10. HICS Construction and Siting Criteria.
        A4.1.3.10.1. HICS construction and siting requirements are found in TO21M-
        LGM30F-2-20-1. General construction and siting information for projects affecting
        the HICS follows. In all cases, the most practical and economic solution will be
        sought consistent with HICS hardness criteria.
        A4.1.3.10.2. Construction Guidelines.
            A4.1.3.10.2.1. For all construction projects, the location of the HICS must be
            positively identified before work commences.
            A4.1.3.10.2.2. Decisions to reroute, relocate or splice in additional HICS should
            be made only as a last resort.
            A4.1.3.10.2.3. When HICS relocating or lowering is unavoidable to maintain
            separation criteria, 4 inches of select backfill must surround the HIC. Refer to
            TO21M-LGM30F-2-20-1 for further protection requirements.
            A4.1.3.10.2.4. Blasting activities are permissible provided that the HICS is not at
            risk of sustaining physical damage. Consult TO 21M-LGM30F-2-20-1 for
            specific criteria.
        A4.1.3.10.3. Siting Criteria.
            A4.1.3.10.3.1. New utilities should be installed at a 90-degree crossing angle
            when possible.
            A4.1.3.10.3.2. Construction permits should not be issued for crossings within 50
            feet of HICS splice locations.
            A4.1.3.10.3.3. Communications cables must have a minimum separation of 12
            inches from the HICS. The minimum crossing angle is 30 degrees.
            A4.1.3.10.3.4. Pipelines must have a minimum separation of 12 inches from the
            HICS. Although the crossing angle is not critical, a minimum angle of 30 degrees
            is desirable to lessen the possibility of damaging the HICS during the crossing.
            A4.1.3.10.3.5. Power cables must have a minimum separation of 18 inches from
            the HICS. The minimum crossing angle is 30 degrees. Underground power
            cables with a potential difference of 2400 volts to ground must have a metallic
            sheath.
            A4.1.3.10.3.6. Highway and railroad crossing criteria are stated in applicable
            drawings. When more practical to leave the HICS in place, waivers of this
            criteria must be granted by HQ AFGSC/A4N.
124                                              AFI21-202V1 17 SEPTEMBER 2014


      A4.1.3.10.3.7. Installation of aerial transmission line towers or poles shall not be
      within100 feet of the HICS, if possible. The separation, required to avoid HICS
      damage during tower/pole installation, may be waived at the discretion of the
      CAO. The electrical effect of 60 hertz power transmission lines crossing parallel
      or nearly parallel to the HICS is negligible.
      A4.1.3.10.3.8. Dam and pond construction over the HICS will be avoided
      whenever possible. When unavoidable, the CAO must ensure no HICS splices
      remain in inundated areas.
AFI21-202V1 17 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                                 125


                                         Attachment 5
                        CENTRALIZED REPAIR ACTIVITY (CRA)

A5.1. Introduction. This attachment contains the guidance, responsibilities and procedures to
establish and manage a CRA. It authorizes the centralized repair for direct maintenance of C-E
equipment; it also authorizes indirect off-equipment maintenance for designated equipment
components. It applies to all Air Force organizations using a centralized repair concept to repair
C-E equipment.
A5.2. Basic Concept of Centralized Repair.
   A5.2.1. Centralized repair consolidates maintenance and supply resources at designated
   locations to support dispersed equipment. It integrates maintenance, supply and other
   logistics elements providing a cohesive support program that enhances logistics
   responsiveness and operational effectiveness while reducing costs (see AFI 23-101 and
   AFMAN 23-122).
   A5.2.2. CRAs consolidate tools, test equipment, spare and repair parts, and skilled personnel
   to provide a combination of logistic services for:
       A5.2.2.1. Direct maintenance, on a dispatch basis, for unattended equipment.
       A5.2.2.2. Direct, usually off-equipment, maintenance assistance for tasks beyond the
       capability of using organizations.
       A5.2.2.3. Indirect off-equipment maintenance and direct maintenance of designated
       reparable equipment.
       A5.2.2.4. Control and distribution of reparable assets received for shop processing.
       A5.2.2.5. Accomplishing using command maintenance at a central location.
           A5.2.2.5.1. Establish CRAs for one system or type of equipment and to perform
           command maintenance functions on the base or site of the CRA.
           A5.2.2.5.2. CRAs which accomplish direct or indirect off-equipment maintenance
           may include a designated supply function, a dedicated satellite account or a special
           support function within the supporting LRS complex. This function controls and
           processes reparable items and distributes serviceable items.
       A5.2.2.6. Source of Repair (SOR). SORs are not CRAs as defined in this attachment;
       however, when jointly agreed to by a MAJCOM and HQ AFMC, CRAs may perform
       SOR maintenance for AFMC. Such workload is defined in a project directive and
       implemented via project order.
A5.3. C-E Centralized Repair Guidance.
   A5.3.1. CRAs must provide clear economic advantages and an ability to sustain or increase
   maintenance and operational effectiveness. CRAs will not duplicate AFMC technology
   repair center (depot) capabilities unless agreed to by HQ AFMC.
   A5.3.2. Specific C-E centralized repair procedures are as follows:
126                                                     AFI21-202V1 17 SEPTEMBER 2014


      A5.3.2.1. Note that the centralized repair concept may be authorized when economic
      benefits are realized while effectively supporting operational readiness. Base decisions
      on logistics support considerations and not on maintenance factors alone. Assess
      tradeoffs between each type of maintenance support.
      A5.3.2.2. Periodically evaluate maintenance programs and plans for all systems and
      equipment to determine if changes (either consolidation or non-consolidation) are
      appropriate. For existing systems, equipment and components supported by a non-
      consolidated maintenance concept at least one of the following benefits must be
      demonstrated or projected against the cost of converting to and sustaining consolidation.
         A5.3.2.2.1. Improved maintenance effectiveness through better utilization of
         personnel and equipment by developing a greater technical capability.
         A5.3.2.2.2. Reduced manpower, equipment and material.
         A5.3.2.2.3. Reduced order, shipping times and transportation costs.
         A5.3.2.2.4. Consider the impacts on:
             A5.3.2.2.4.1. Inventory control point and depot source of repair.
             A5.3.2.2.4.2. Automated management systems.
             A5.3.2.2.4.3. Procedural changes, waivers or alternatives.
             A5.3.2.2.4.4. Financial and inventory accounting policies and procedures.
             A5.3.2.2.4.5. Organizational structures and work center manning.
             A5.3.2.2.4.6. One-time implementation costs.
             A5.3.2.2.4.7. Engineering and technical services.
             A5.3.2.2.4.8. Interservice support agreements, where applicable.
             A5.3.2.2.4.9. Programmed equipment life.
             A5.3.2.2.4.10. Investment spares cost at all levels.
             A5.3.2.2.4.11. Contractor maintenance.
             A5.3.2.2.4.12. Geographical dispersal and relocation of equipment.
             A5.3.2.2.4.13. Acquisition and life cycle support cost for common and peculiar
             equipment and tools.
             A5.3.2.2.4.14. Obtaining required technical data.
      A5.3.2.3. Implement the centralized repair concept only with the concurrence of all
      involved MAJCOMs/agencies (e.g., maintaining, host, AFMC and Air Intelligence
      Agency - AIA) unless HQ USAF directs otherwise.
      A5.3.2.4. Evaluate the centralized repair concept during the programming process for
      facilities, systems and equipment and as a part of the maintenance planning cycle for new
      or improved systems.
AFI21-202V1 17 SEPTEMBER 2014                                                            127


A5.4. Centralized Repair Concept Responsibilities:
   A5.4.1. HQ USAF/A4L establishes the overall guidance; reviews and approves plans,
   projects, programs and management systems; and resolves proposed consolidation actions
   that do not have the concurrence of all involved MAJCOMs.
   A5.4.2. MAJCOMs establish a focal point for CRA management:
      A5.4.2.1. Continually monitor the support posture for assigned systems and equipment
      and periodically evaluate pertinent maintenance programs and plans to determine if
      changes are appropriate. Publish Maintenance Action Directive (MAD) authorizing and
      directing establishment of a CRA. MADs also identify equipment or systems supported
      by the CRA and any special funding arrangements, responsibilities, or procedures.
      A5.4.2.2. Initiate action with other involved commands to establish CRAs and revise
      maintenance plans where appropriate.
      A5.4.2.3. Coordinate changes to support posture with supported MAJCOMs.
   A5.4.3. Note that supported MAJCOMs participate with maintaining commands to assess
   consolidation cost effectiveness and to develop CRA management procedures and other
   support functions, as necessary.
   A5.4.4. HQ AFMC:
      A5.4.4.1. Ensures maintenance plans and programs represent an integration of all
      support levels and logistics support plans identify specific procedures applicable to
      centralized repair.
      A5.4.4.2. Ensures consolidation efforts are compatible with the functions of the
      inventory control point or national inventory control point.
      A5.4.4.3. Ensures both wholesale and retail level logistics management functions
      support the centralized repair concept and its specific application.
      A5.4.4.4. Participates with and supports MAJCOMs consolidation cost effectiveness
      assessments.
      A5.4.4.5. Revises maintenance program plans and documentation to reflect centralized
      repair when applied.
      A5.4.4.6. Monitors system and equipment support postures and recommends centralized
      repair to MAJCOMs when cost analysis indicates it is, or may be, appropriate.
      A5.4.4.7. Ensures maintenance plans and programs include CRA requirements for new
      equipment and are outlined in the appropriate documents such as Program Management
      Directive (PMD), Program Active Directives (PAD) and Integrated Logistic Support Plan
      (ILSP).
   A5.4.5. Assess application of the centralized repair concept as part of the maintenance
   planning cycle for systems and equipment being developed.
   A5.4.6. AIA participates with involved MAJCOMs in all aspect of consolidation that affects
   cryptologic equipment.
 128                                                    AFI21-202V1 17 SEPTEMBER 2014


A5.5. Authority to Establish CRA.
   A5.5.1. CRAs may be authorized in one of three ways:
       A5.5.1.1. HQ USAF direction.
       A5.5.1.2. Maintenance Concepts. Maintenance concepts are normally developed during
       the acquisition programs concept, development and validation phases. If maintenance
       support responsibility within the command can best be accomplished by a CRA, include
       this concept in the ILSP. Manpower, tools, test equipment, facilities and other resources
       are programmed at this time.
       A5.5.1.3. Maintenance policy reviews. Reviews of maintenance policies, procedures
