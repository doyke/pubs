                                              Chapter 2

                                           CDDAR TEAM

2.1. Purpose. The purpose of this guide is to assist leaders and members of the CDDAR team,
to plan for and conduct successful recovery operations. It is intended to promote thoughts and
ideas for various techniques, which can be used. Any effective variations of these techniques,
new techniques developed, or available new equipment identified should be submitted to
MAJCOM for evaluation.
2.2. Mishap/Accident Investigations. Virtually every aircraft, which requires recovery, has
been involved in a mishap. Certain conditions require the investigating commander to convene
an accident investigation. CDDAR leaders and planners should be familiar with these procedures
and know the precedence of such investigations over recovery efforts.
2.3. Responsibilities. When a mishap occurs on or near a base, the nearest Air Force Base
commander is responsible for providing Crash, Fire-fighting and Rescue (CFR), and EOD
support. He or she also must secure and preserve any evidence or wreckage. Before beginning
any recovery operation, the CDDAR team chief must obtain approval from the incident
commander (IC), the EOD team chief (when applicable) and the investigating commander. The
IC should identify any real or potential hazards to personnel.
2.4. Urgency of Recovery. Chapter 5 covers methods of aircraft removal for truly urgent
situations. This type of recovery places both assets and personnel at risk and is to be avoided
except during times of tension or war.
2.5. Recovery. Even normal safe recovery procedures can be executed at an increased pace if
conditions warrant. In such cases, techniques may be used which risk additional damage to the
aircraft. The following factors should be considered to determine how great the need is for rapid
recovery. The IC will determine urgency.
     2.5.1. Availability of alternate taxiways.
     2.5.2. Availability of alternate airports.
     2.5.3. Position of disabled aircraft relative to aircraft movement areas.
     2.5.4. Cost of diversions/loss of operations.
     2.5.5. Military alert commitments.

                                 RISK MANAGEMENT (RM)

3.1. Situation Evaluation. The first task at an aircraft recovery site is to gather information and
evaluate the situation. The initial response team will be able to gather much of this data and
initiate requests for additional information from appropriate sources. This section provides
sample checklists for gathering essential data. Having all this information on a single clipboard
will make it easier to answer questions. Once all necessary information has been gathered it can
and should be used to accomplish a risk assessment.
   3.1.1. Safety, definitions, purpose, scope, and using RM is the common sense approach to
   making calculated decisions on human material and environmental factors. It enables those in
   charge to maximize operational capabilities while minimizing risks at all levels, preserving
   assets, and safeguarding health and welfare. The most important aspect of RM is to accept no
   unnecessary risk.
3.2. Environmental, Safety, and Health Hazards. The key for developing a safe and effective
CDDAR program is communication and coordination. The CDDAR office of primary
responsibility (OPR) must ensure the BEE is consulted and directly involved in determining
personnel health hazards, training required, and appropriate levels of Personal Protective
Equipment (PPE). Note: There are two distinct phases of an aircraft mishap--initial response
and recovery. Initial response teams face the probability of an aircraft fire. As the composite
material burns, gases, vapors and solid particles are released into the smoke plume. Recovery
team members may be exposed to fibers and dusts as aircraft parts are moved, modified by
cutting, breaking, twisting, or hammering. Personnel tasked to participate in crash or post-crash
response, recovery, maintenance, and/or clean up operations must be aware of and briefed on all
possible health issues involved. Units must ensure local policies and procedures for handling
crash damaged composites are addressed; to include training and PPE.
   3.2.1. Each organization involved in CDDAR must develop a respiratory protection program
   for proper respirator use IAW Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH) Standard
   48-137, Respiratory Protection Program. C-130J aircraft have numerous components
   manufactured from composite material.

                                             Chapter 4

                                           EQUIPMENT

4.1. Overall Equipment Planning. This chapter deals with equipment commonly used for
Aircraft Recovery. The CDDAR team will be cognizant of the following requirements:
   4.1.1. What equipment is available (inventory).
   4.1.2. The types and capacities of available equipment (cranes, dozers, etc.).
   4.1.3. Contractual arrangements necessary for additional                    equipment        required
   (Government Purchase Card, base contracting, agreements etc.).
4.2. Other Factors. Other factors to be considered are:
   4.2.1. Terrain in the region of responsibilities (woods, hills, water, urban areas, etc.).
   4.2.2. Climate extremes.
   4.2.3. Type and frequency of flying operations.
4.3. Crash Recovery Trailer. Standard equipment in the crash recovery trailer should include:
   4.3.1. Slings, dollies, tow bridles, etc. for aircraft assigned to that base.
   4.3.2. Ropes, cables, pulleys, chains, etc.
   4.3.3. Empty sandbags, timbers, shoring material.
   4.3.4. Pneumatic lifting bags, hoses, control consoles.
   4.3.5. Plywood sheets.
   4.3.6. Steel plates, pierced steel planking.
   4.3.7. Picks, shovels, sledge hammers, crowbars.
   4.3.8. Grounding rod and grounding cables.
   4.3.9. Gloves, coveralls, hard-hats, body harness, hearing protectors, goggles, etc.
   4.3.10. Fluid sample kits for fuel, oil, and hydraulic fluid.
   4.3.11. Communication headsets and ground cords.
   4.3.12. First aid kits.
   4.3.13. Step ladders and step stands.
4.4. Diversified Base Assets. Aircraft recoveries will generally require assets from numerous
base organizations. Aircraft maintenance shops provide both specialized equipment and
personnel trained in its use. Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) shops will be called upon to
provide a great deal of support equipment. Organizations such as Civil Engineering frequently
have items and equipment necessary for recovery operations.
4.5. Common Support Items. Equipment which must be collected from various base locations
may include:
      4.5.1. Maintenance stands and other non-powered AGE.
KEESLERAFBI21-102 10 FEBRUARY 2014                                                        11


   4.5.2. Air compressors, generators, lighting, heaters, air conditioners, and other powered
   AGE.
   4.5.3. Mobile Command Post.
   4.5.4. Communications equipment.
   4.5.5. Earth moving equipment.
   4.5.6. Tow vehicles, de-fueling trucks, etc.
   4.5.7. Mechanics tools.
   4.5.8. Sand, gravel, cement, timbers, lumber.
   4.5.9. Cables, chains, hooks, clamps, hand winches.
   4.5.10. Metal cutting saws, bolt cutters.
   4.5.11. Cranes, winch trucks.
   4.5.12. Food, water, coffee, etc. (for recovery personnel).
   4.5.13. Standby medical and fire support.
   4.5.14. Portable temporary shelters.
4.6. Recovery Teams. Commanders will consider recovery teams to be emergency operations
and will allow recovery crews access to disaster preparedness and other emergency assets. The
CDDAR team chief will know what is available from such stores. Emergency stocks may
include mobility assets such as:
   4.6.1. Hand-held radios.
   4.6.2. Mobile communications vans.
4.7. Local Contractor Equipment. CDDAR efforts commonly require items and/or equipment
not available on base. Due to the serious nature of recovery work, funding is usually made
available to purchase or rent local equipment. Local plans should address funding sources and
identify contractual methods to be used. Frequently required items include:
   4.7.1. Large cranes (with highly skilled operators).
   4.7.2. Earth moving equipment.
   4.7.3. Timbers, gravel, etc. (in large quantities).

                                            Chapter 5

                                   AIRCRAFT REMOVAL

5.1. Urgent Removal. Depending on the circumstance, a crash, damaged or disabled aircraft
will require immediate removal. This is to be accomplished despite certain additional damage to
the aircraft. Note: Urgent removal scenarios are not usually applicable to most stateside bases.
   5.1.1. An aircraft removed by conventional methods (slings, bags, jacks) will require less
   time to complete damage repairs in comparison to one removed by urgent removal
   techniques (dossier). This difference in repair times may justify use of conventional recovery
   methods despite increased recovery times. Joint decisions of the aircraft owning and base
   operating commands are required.
5.2. Evaluation of Damage: Unless the recovery team chief does not possess significant
knowledge regarding the aircraft type, it is not likely that an accurate damage evaluation can be
made. Where a team chief may see a pile of scrap metal, a mechanic for that aircraft may see
numerous high value spare parts or even a repairable airframe. When possible, type-experienced
maintenance personnel should be called to assist in removals. Thus, damage to critical parts may
be avoided.
5.3. Pulling vs. Pushing: There usually isn’t a need to push an aircraft from a runway or
operational area; pulling is always preferable. Some advantages are as follows:
   5.3.1. Safety: Pulling can be accomplished from a safe distance away from the aircraft. In
   urgent removal situations there will likely be unexploded ordnance, fuel fires, dangerous
   chemicals and/or other hazards to personnel. Removal operations are best conducted away
   from the aircraft.
   5.3.2. Traction: Vehicles used to pull the aircraft can be positioned where traction is better
   than that around the aircraft. Pulling may be done by winch from anchored positions.
   5.3.3. Damage: Pulling usually results in less airframe damage than pushing.
5.4. Pulling Techniques: Winching is a preferred method since it is more controllable. If an
aircraft must be pulled on an arcing path, winching from changing anchor positions is preferred
if terrain allows. Pulling is broken into two parts: cable attachment and airframe sliding
procedures. Sliding procedures applicable to pushing as well as pulling airframes are generally
illustrated in applicable aircraft -3 aircraft structural technical order manuals.
5.5. Cable Attachment: Structural manuals list cable attachment points for various aircraft
types in order to accomplish removal. Generally, landing gear trunnion points, landing gear,
major bulkheads, longerons and wing spar attachment points are used. It may be faster and safer
to use heavy chains with hooks to attach cables with prepared loops to the airframe.
   5.5.1. The attachment should be made at the lowest possible point so that pulling results in
   slight upward lift of the airframe. Attachment is also to be at the airframe points closest to the
   pulling vehicles to avoid downward loading on forward Center of Gravity (CG) points.
5.6. Recovery Methods. Aircraft recovery usually involves seven general steps. The extent of
these tasks will depend upon the size and type of aircraft and the general situation. Recovery
KEESLERAFBI21-102 10 FEBRUARY 2014                                                              13


team members must be familiar with all parts of this section and should consider which
techniques are most likely to be used at their location. Recovery tasks:
   5.6.1. Overall assessment, analysis, planning, and briefings.
   5.6.2. Alteration of weight and CG.
   5.6.3. Functional and structural assessment of the aircraft.
   5.6.4. Lifting the aircraft.
   5.6.5. Providing portability to the airframe.
   5.6.6. Lowering the aircraft.
   5.6.7. Movement of the aircraft.
5.7. Briefings. As soon as the initial planning step has been completed, a briefing should be
conducted by the CDDAR team chief for all involved parties. Comments and critique are
encouraged to allow pooling of everyone’s expertise. The briefing should address the next step
(alteration of weight and CG) in detail. A tentative plan to accomplish the remaining recovery
steps should be briefed in general terms. This will allow all involved to begin thinking of various
possible hazards and ways to minimize them. Detailed briefings are best broken down into
several distinct tasks and one person appointed to be responsible for each task. Each task leader
must fully understand their responsibilities and how they interface with others. Task leaders are
expected to brief all other personnel involved in their tasks.
5.8. Briefing Content. Briefings should cover the following topics:
   5.8.1. The tasks to be accomplished (what).
   5.8.2. The intended purpose of each task (why).
   5.8.3. The sequence of the tasks (when).
   5.8.4. Responsibility for each task (who).
   5.8.5. Coordination of the task (how).
   5.8.6. Any known hazards involved.
   5.8.7. Evacuation procedures.
5.9. Evacuation Procedures. Due to the many unknown (as well as known) hazards involved
in an aircraft recovery, an evacuation plan is essential. Every individual involved in the recovery
operation must be informed of evacuation procedures. During extended recovery efforts, shift
changes and the arrival of various specialists must be considered. Plans should be established by
the CDDAR team chief to ensure that everyone entering the security perimeter is advised of
evacuation procedures.
   5.9.1. Three key elements of an evacuation plan are:
       5.9.1.1. Alarm. How an alarm will be sounded if a serious hazard is seen.
       5.9.1.2. Recognition of Alarm.       What the alarm/signal will be for recognition and
       response purposes.
 14                                              KEESLERAFBI21-102 10 FEBRUARY 2014


       5.9.1.3. Response.     What the appropriate response will be upon receiving the
       alarm/signal.
5.10. Evacuation Signals. Noise level is the primary factor to consider in devising an
evacuation signal. Recovery operations are frequently very noisy in themselves. Often nearby
aircraft operations are still being conducted. Visual, as well as audio warnings, should be
considered. Portable air horns, large spotlights, whistles, and megaphones can also be used as
signals. Consider the frequency of the ambient noise and try to use audio signals with different
and/or varying frequencies.
5.11. Alteration of Weight and CG. Prior to lifting an aircraft, especially large aircraft, the
weight is generally reduced as much as possible. In some cases, adding or shifting weight to
selected points may aid recovery by changing the CG.
   5.11.1. Before beginning any weight or CG changes, the existing aircraft weight and CG
   must be determined as closely as possible. Flight crew members, crew chiefs, and aircraft
   tech orders are all good sources for this data. The -3 aircraft structural technical order
   manuals contain a large amount of standard aircraft data.
5.12. CG Transfer. In the event that only a portion of the aircraft must be lifted (e.g. single
point landing gear collapse), much work can be saved by shifting the aircraft CG away from the
portion to be lifted. This may actually be more beneficial than reducing the aircraft weight. For
example, if the nose wheel is collapsed, shifting weight (and thus CG) rearward can reduce
effective nose weight until one man can lift it. Several precautions must be taken to control such
operations to avoid overstressing the airframe or causing additional damage.
   5.12.1. The following examples are methods of CG transfer:
       5.12.1.1. CG movement by fuel transfer.
       5.12.1.2. CG movement by cargo transfer.
       5.12.1.3. CG movement by weight addition.
       5.12.1.4. CG movement by weight reduction.
       5.12.1.5. Weight reduction for lifting.
       5.12.1.6. Munitions removal.
       5.12.1.7. Fuel removal.
       5.12.1.8. Engine removal.
       5.12.1.9. Component removal.

                                          TRAINING

6.1. Aircraft Recovery Training General. The CDDAR Team Chiefs will establish a training
program for assigned weapons systems. This program will require the identification of essential
personnel to implement procedures outlined in AFI 21-101, and T.O. 00-80C-1. Training
objectives will incorporate knowledge, understanding, and hands-on usage, utilizing classroom
and application training.
6.2. Recovery Team Qualifications. All team members must be qualified in basic CDDAR
operations. All qualifications are recorded in the Career Field Education and Training Plan
(CFETP), AF Form 797, Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS, or
Maintenance Information Systems (MIS) as applicable.
   6.2.1. Qualification Training Requirements. All team members must be trained and
   qualified in recovery procedures IAW AFI 21-101, Mission Design Series (MDS) specific
   technical data, other applicable AF and MAJCOM directives and unit-developed training
   guide.
   6.2.2. All recovery team members must receive annual qualification training following
   initial training comprised of both academic and hands on training/exercises. Ensure all
   qualification training is documented.
6.3. Scenarios. Scenarios are ideal training situations. They enhance real world recovery
requirements. The CDDAR team chief should develop scenarios and incorporate them with
hands-on training.
6.4. Recovery Team Qualification Training. IAW AFI 21-101, all recovery team members
must receive initial training comprised of both academic and hands on training/exercises. Ensure
all training is documented in TBA, AF Form 797, or MIS as applicable. Do not lift the aircraft
wheels off the ground.
   6.4.1. Conduct a crash recovery lift exercise annually for C-130 aircraft consisting of either
   lifting devices positioning, sling hookup, and mock hoisting. IAW AFI 21-101 and AFI 21-
   101 AFRC Sup1 and T.O. 00-80C-1. Do not use operational aircraft for actual aircraft lifts
   in a training environment. If the unit does not possess training assets suitable for exercises,
   units demonstrate capability by completing all steps but stopping short of actually lifting an
   operational aircraft. Note: The actual recovery of an aircraft performed by a unit satisfies the
   annual requirement when it meets all aspects of a crash recovery exercise.

                                             Chapter 7

                                       MISCELLANEOUS

7.1. Briefings. Briefings will be accomplished by the CDDAR team chief prior to training on
actual aircraft recovery operations. Keep in mind not all situations are common. Performing
operations safely IAW technical data and Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH)
standards will minimize risks. When hazards cannot be completely eliminated, consider RM
analysis. Below are suggested topics:
   7.1.1. Personal issues, potential mishap or hazards including PPE.
   7.1.2. Can workers be struck by or contacted by anything?
   7.1.3. Can workers strike against or come in contact with any item which can cause injury?
   7.1.4. Can workers be caught in or between anything?
   7.1.5. Can workers fall?
   7.1.6. Can workers overexert?
   7.1.7. Are workers required to do repetitive lifting or heavy lifting?
   7.1.8. Are workers exposed to potential hazards such as toxic gases, chemicals, radiation, or
   noise?
7.2. Safety Assessments. The following are additional personnel and safety assessments
pertaining to aircraft recovery:
   7.2.1. Are workers wearing required PPE (safety toe shoes, hearing protection, gloves, and
   safety goggles)?
   7.2.2. Are workers aware of avoiding suspended loads when lifting items?
   7.2.3. Are workers aware of lifting cable limitations?
   7.2.4. Is on scene supervision assessing the risks in climbing operations?
   7.2.5. Is the crash site area assessed for slip and fall potential?
7.3. Environmental. Aircraft crashes may involve issues and situations that have both before
and after environmental repercussions. Survey assessment and correction of initial environmental
impacts need to be resolved immediately, such as fluid or gas leakage, cargo spillage and
physical damage to include fire. These items should already be analyzed but may require
technical expertise from the recovery team specialties or base functions. Additional information
may need to be solicited from bioenvironmental and base safety prior to entering a recovery site.
Note: Environmental issues are enforced by federal, state, and local laws. Proper authority must
be involved prior to closure of any aircraft incident.
