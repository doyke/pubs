SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
1. General. The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the ground
work for reporting the status of aircraft availability. They list the minimum essential systems
and subsystems that must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit wartime,
training, test or other missions. Mission Ready Available is used in readiness SORTS reporting
only and denotes MC aircraft capable of being configured for a contingency mission in
accordance with COMACC OMNIBUS Plan.

      1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex
      degraded mission systems such as suspension equipment.
      1.2. Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy FMC
      aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC. A Not Mission Capable
      (NMC) aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can be configured and
      generated to MRA status at an employment site.
      1.3. All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Major
      Command differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to another
      MAJCOM theater, the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and specify the
      unit's requirements, and resource the differences in support/mission equipment.
      1.4. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by work unit
      code (WUC) against the FSL and all applicable BSLs across the page. Each unit's Design
      Operational Capability (DOC) statement determines applicability of BSL columns. The
      aircraft MESLs incorporate all ACC assigned aircraft and therefore it is important to
      compare only those columns listed in the MESL which are applicable to the unit's assigned
      aircraft. For example, units with CC (wartime) coded aircraft would determine and report
      status using only the FSL and BSL columns related to their DOC statement. Units with TF
      (training) coded aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL and TNG
      columns , and units with CB (test) coded aircraft would determine and report status using
      only the FSL and TST columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft will ensure status is
      reported using the MESL columns appropriate to the individual aircraft assignment code.
