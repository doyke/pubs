                                            Chapter 1

                                       INTRODUCTION

Section 1A—Overview

1.1. Purpose. Hazardous chemicals are found in virtually every Air Force operation, including
aircraft and missile maintenance, civil engineering, transportation, supply, medical, and support
functions. This AFI is intended to minimize the incidence of chemically induced occupational
illnesses and injuries in the workplace by establishing guidance for training employees on the
health and physical hazards associated with, and proper preventive measures to be taken when,
using or handling hazardous chemicals in work area/shop(s). This program is commonly referred
to as the Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) Program, and is not to be confused with other
separate and distinct entities such as Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
(HAZWOPER) and the Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) Management Program (HMMP).
HAZCOM is a performance-based program with separate training requirements and successful
implementation can only be measured by evaluating worker awareness of work area/shop
hazards.
1.1. (WHITEMAN) This Supplement combined with the Workcenter Specific Hazardous
Chemical Training Handbook, hazardous material list, and non-routine task listing, serves as the
Environment, Safety and Occupational Health (ESOH) approved (509th Medical Operations
Squadron Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight, 509th Medical Operations Squadron Public
Health, 509th Bomb Wing Safety, and 509th Civil Engineer Squadron Fire Emergency Services)
work center’s written Hazard Communication program in accordance with AFI 90-821, which
supersedes AFOSHSTD 161-21 Hazard Communication.
1.2. Scope.
     1.2.1. This AFI provides the requirements for an effective Air Force HAZCOM Program for
     those work area/shop(s) that have workers that handle or use hazardous chemicals. All
     employees that work in an environment where any chemical is known to be present in such a
     manner that employees may be exposed under normal conditions of use or in a foreseeable
     emergency, will be provided information about the hazardous chemicals to which they are
     exposed. This information shall be provided by means of a hazard communication program,
     including but not limited to material safety data sheets (MSDSs), labels, and other forms of
     warning, and information [e.g. AF Form 3952, Chemical/Hazardous Material
     Request/Authorization Forms, Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) shop survey letters] and
     training.
     1.2.2. This AFI applies to:
        1.2.2.1. All U.S. Air Force military and civilian personnel, direct-hire foreign nationals,
        and indirect-hire foreign employees at Air Force installations within the Continental
        United States (CONUS), or its territories, GOCOs, GSUs, and in foreign countries as
        established in accordance with the applicable Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA).
        1.2.2.2. The Air Force Reserves, the Air National Guard, and direct reporting units
        (DRU) and field operating agencies (FOA) not located on Air Force installations.
AFI90-821_WHITEMANSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013                                                           5


       1.2.2.3. All Air Force military and civilian personnel who use, handle, or may be
       potentially exposed to chemical hazards while working under a contractor or working in
       contractor facilities. Where feasible, Air Force personnel may be included in the
       contractor’s Federal compliant hazard communication program. The Air Force retains
       ultimate responsibility for Air Force personnel participation and oversight.
       1.2.2.4. Contractor employees who are employed at Air Force-owned or operated
       facilities when authorized by the Contracting Officer in coordination with BE with the
       following exceptions:
          1.2.2.4.1. This AFI does not excuse contractors, as stipulated in their specific
          contracts, from their compliance obligations under OSHA’s Federal HAZCOM
          regulation or any applicable State and local requirements.
          1.2.2.4.2. Contractors are required to train their own employees in accordance with
          Federal HAZCOM and any applicable State and local requirements. Contractors are
          not authorized to use the AF HAZCOM Program for this purpose.
   1.2.3. The Federal HAZCOM Standard has primacy over state programs at Air Force
   installations even if the state has an OSHA-approved state program.
   1.2.4. Materials exempted from this standard are listed under the Hazard Communication
   Program description contained in Para. 2.2.
   1.2.5. In work operations such as warehousing where employees only handle chemicals in
   sealed containers which are not opened under normal conditions of use, this instruction
   applies to these operations only as follows:
       1.2.5.1. Supervisors will ensure labels on incoming containers of hazardous chemicals
       are not removed or defaced.
       1.2.5.2. MSDSs received with incoming shipments of sealed containers will be
       maintained, and employees will have access to the MSDSs. If hazardous chemicals
       received do not have MSDSs, they will be obtained as soon as possible.
       1.2.5.3. Supervisors will train employees on the hazards of the chemicals in their work
       area/shop, and to the extent necessary to protect them in the event of a spill or leak of a
       hazardous chemical from a sealed container.

                                          Chapter 2

                        HAZARD COMMUNICATION PROGRAM

2.1. Introduction. AF HAZCOM program requirements apply to any chemical hazard, except
as stated in Para. 2.2 below, known to be present in work area/shop(s) in such a manner
employees may be exposed under normal conditions of use or in a foreseeable emergency.
2.2. Materials Exempt from the AF HAZCOM Program. AF HAZCOM program
requirements do not apply to the following.
   2.2.1. Hazardous wastes regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
   (RCRA).
   2.2.2. Hazardous substances subject to a remedial action or removal action under the
   Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA).
   2.2.3. Tobacco or tobacco products.
   2.2.4. Wood or wood products that will not be processed.
   2.2.5. Articles. An article is a manufactured item other than fluid or particle: (1) which is
   formed to a specific shape or design during manufacture; (2) which has end-use function(s)
   dependent in whole or in part upon its shape or design during end use; and (3) which under
   normal conditions of use does not release more than very small quantities, e.g., minute or
   trace amounts of hazardous chemicals [as determined under 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)], and does
   not pose a physical hazard or health risk to employees.
   2.2.6. Food or alcoholic beverages.
   2.2.7. Drugs in final form [such as non-prescription and prescription, dry pelletized drugs,
   e.g., pills or caplets].
   2.2.8. Cosmetics.
   2.2.9. Consumer products in normal consumer use such as vehicle propane tanks, copier
   toner, etc (i.e., material usage in the workplace is for the purpose intended by the chemical
   manufacturer or importer of the product, and the use results in a duration and frequency of
   exposure which is not greater than the range of exposures that could reasonably be
   experienced by consumers when used for the purpose intended).
      2.2.9.1. Whether consumer product materials are subject to the AF HAZCOM program
      and require training requires a case-by-case judgment by the supervisor in consultation
      with BE. For example:
          2.2.9.1.1. Personnel who use window cleaner fluid to clean infrequently will not
          require this training; however, maintenance personnel using the same window cleaner
          daily will require training.
          2.2.9.1.2. Patrons using automotive cleaners at the auto skills center will not require
          training; however, auto skills center employees and LRS transportation personnel
          using the same cleaner as part of their job will require training.
   2.2.10. Nuisance particulates such as copier toner.
AFI90-821_WHITEMANSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013                                                        15


   2.2.11. Ionizing and non-ionizing radiation.
   2.2.12. Biological hazards.
   2.2.13. Munitions as defined in AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management.
2.3. Installation Written Hazard Communication Program. Each Air Force installation
whose employees will potentially be exposed to hazardous materials not exempted as described
in Para. 2.2 must create a written hazard communication program to support work area/shop
implementation of the HAZCOM program. The written program must include installation-
specific procedures to meet the HAZCOM program requirements and specifically, will include:
   2.3.1. How MSDSs are accessible to employees (see Para. 2.5).
   2.3.2. Container labeling procedures and requirements (see Para. 2.6).
   2.3.3. Training requirements and procedures (see Para. 2.7).
   2.3.4. Chemical inventory requirements (see Para. 2.8).
   2.3.5. Procedures for informing employees regarding hazards of non-routine tasks and
   unlabeled pipes (see Para. 2.9).
   2.3.6. Procedures for determining the hazard of a chemical (See Para. 2.4; applies to only
   work area/shops which produce hazardous chemicals).
2.4. Hazard Determination: The Air Force will rely on the hazard determination of the
supplier or manufacturer of purchased chemicals. For Air Force produced chemicals, the Air
Force activity controlling the formulation will make the hazard determination and produce an
MSDS IAW 29 CFR 1910.1200. The Air Force activity producing the chemical will include
hazard determination procedures in their written program, and ensure their personnel are trained
on the hazards. If the chemical is transferred to any other organizations, the producing
organization will provide a MSDS with the shipment and transmit the MSDS to AFIOH.
2.5. Material Safety Data Sheets. Each MSDS is a detailed information bulletin prepared by
the chemical manufacturer describing the physical and chemical properties, physical and health
hazards, routes of exposure, precautions for safe handling and use, emergency and first-aid
procedures, and control measures of the listed hazardous chemicals. The MSDS shall be
prepared to be consistent with 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) requirements. OCONUS locations will
maintain documents consistent with 29 CFR 1910.1200(g). If a document consistent with 29
CFR 1910.1200(g) cannot be obtained from the OCONUS supplier, a document meeting the
intent of 29 CFR 1910.1200(g) is acceptable.
   2.5.1. An MSDS must be immediately accessible (in either paper or electronic format) for
   every item on the work area/shop-specific hazardous chemical inventory. The MSDS on file
   must match the manufacturer and part number/trade name of the material on-hand. In
   addition, the MSDS preparation date must be consistent with the date/lot of any material on-
   hand. If a new MSDS is received, but the old material is still on-hand, the MSDS, which
   matched the old material, must be retained.
   2.5.2. MSDSs may be obtained from several sources. These include, but are not limited to,
   the chemical manufacturer or supplier, installation or unit HAZMART, DoD HMIRS on-line
   or CD-ROM, or through the ESOH-MIS. If the MSDS is not available from these sources,

   2.5.3. Access to MSDSs in the work area/shops will be provided as follows:
      2.5.3.1. All workers on all shifts must know how to obtain an MSDS, and have
      unrestricted direct access to MSDSs for their work area/shop during all shifts.
      2.5.3.2. MSDSs may be maintained in the work area/shops in paper or electronic version.
      OSHA does not specifically prohibit any form of access as long as "no barriers to
      immediate employee access" are created.
      2.5.3.3. The location of MSDSs and/or means of access for any work area/shop will be
      determined locally. The supervisor should consider how long it would take for a worker
      to obtain an MSDS if it were needed to respond to a spill or if a worker was accidentally
      splashed with a hazardous chemical.
      2.5.3.4. If the primary means for MSDS access is electronic, a back-up system for MSDS
      access must be established in case primary computer access is disrupted. The back-up
      system may include, but is not limited to, paper copies, local computer files or CDs at
      another non-impacted location, telephone, fax, or access through a nearby HAZMART or
      BE Flight. Local judgment must be used to determine an adequate back-up system on a
      case-by-case basis.
      2.5.3.5. BE or other qualified personnel will provide explanations or interpretations of
      the MSDS to supervisors and affected workers, as requested, for routine training and
      planning, and will be available during emergency situations to assist in interpretation of
      MSDSs.
      2.5.3.6. Where personnel must travel between work area/shops during a work shift (e.g.,
      their work is carried out at more than one geographical location such as flight line
      operations), the MSDS may be kept at the primary work area/shop facility. In this
      situation, the supervisor shall ensure that personnel can immediately obtain the required
      information in an emergency.
   2.5.4. Ensure any proprietary formulary and/or trade secret information in an MSDS is
   protected and used only as a management tool for exposure and incident prevention or health
   hazard education. During the acquisition process, the Bioenvironmental Engineer (BEE) will
   discuss trade-secret limitations with the work area/shop supervisor; however, supervisors
   using materials with trade-secret information are encouraged to be familiar with requirements
   and restrictions listed in 29 CFR 1910.1200(i). When requesting proprietary information, the
   BEE may be asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement regarding a manufacturer’s
   proprietary information; consult with Legal Services in non-disclosure criteria are not clear.
2.6. Labels and Other Forms of Warning.
   2.6.1. Labeling of hazardous chemical containers will be done according to 29 CFR
   1910.1200(f), and DoDI 6050.5-H, DoD Hazardous Chemical Warning Labeling System.
   2.6.2. It is the responsibility of chemical manufacturers, importers and commercial
   distributors to label containers of hazardous chemicals according to the OSHA’s Federal
   HAZCOM standard. Accordingly, chemical containers entering the installation through the
   supply system or through local purchase should already be labeled. Supply receiving and
   HAZMARTs will ensure incoming containers are properly labeled. Supply receiving and
AFI90-821_WHITEMANSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013                                                       17


  HAZMARTS will submit an item discrepancy report to identify any containers received
  without proper labeling from the manufacturer.
  2.6.3. Materials exempted from HAZCOM labeling requirements are described as follows
  [See 29 CFR 1910.1200(b)(5) if additional details are desired]:
     2.6.3.1. Any pesticide as such term is defined in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
     Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) when subject to the labeling requirements of that Act.
     2.6.3.2. Any chemical substance or mixture as such terms are defined in the Toxic
     Substances Control Act (TSCA) when subject to the labeling requirements of that Act.
     2.6.3.3. Any food, food additive, color additive, drug, cosmetic, or medical or veterinary
     device or product, including materials intended for use as ingredients in such products
     (e.g., flavors and fragrances), as such terms are defined in the Federal Food, Drug, and
     Cosmetic Act.
     2.6.3.4. Any distilled spirits (beverage alcohols), wine, or malt beverage intended for
     non-industrial use, as such terms are defined in the Federal Alcohol Administration Act,
     and regulations issued under that Act, when subject to the labeling requirements of that
     Act and labeling regulations issued under that Act by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
     and Firearms.
     2.6.3.5. Any consumer product or hazardous substance as those terms are defined in the
     Consumer Product Safety Act and Federal Hazardous Substances Act respectively, when
     subject to a consumer product safety standard or labeling requirement of those Acts, or
     regulations issued under those Acts by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
     2.6.3.6. Agricultural or vegetable seed treated with pesticides and labeled in accordance
     with the Federal Seed Act and labeling regulations issued under that Act by the
     Department of Agriculture.
  2.6.4. Supervisors will ensure labels on containers of hazardous chemicals used in their work
  area/shop meet HAZCOM requirements, remain affixed to their containers, and are not
  obliterated or covered. At minimum, the following information will appear on container
  labels [refer to 29 CFR 1910.1200(f)(6) for alternate means]:
     2.6.4.1. The identity of the hazardous chemical(s) in the container.
     2.6.4.2. Appropriate hazard warnings that include information about the specific physical
     and health hazard(s), including target organ effects of the chemical(s) in the container.
     This may be accomplished using any combination of words, symbols, or pictures.
  2.6.5. Installation HAZMARTs may affix other labels to containers for locally determined
  purposes. If the HAZMART label duplicates the Federal HAZCOM standard requirements,
  the original label may be covered. If the HAZMART label does not duplicate the
  information required by the Federal HAZCOM standard, information on the original label
  must remain legible.
     2.6.5.1. (Added-WHITEMAN) DD Form 2521, Hazardous Chemical Warning Label
     (8 1/2x11) or DD Form 2522, Hazardous Chemical Warning Label (4x6) when available,
     will be used as a uniform labeling system to meet the labeling requirements for:
         2.6.5.1.1. (Added-WHITEMAN) Existing stocks of unlabeled materials.
 18                                        AFI90-821_WHITEMANSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013


          2.6.5.1.2. (Added-WHITEMAN) Hazardous materials manufactured within the Air
          Force.
          2.6.5.1.3. (Added-WHITEMAN) Transferring, repackaging or distributing of bulk
          quantities of hazardous materials into other containers (breakdown quantities). The
          exception for this rule is when a material is placed in an unmarked container and used
          or returned to the original container after task completion or within one work shift,
          whichever is sooner.
          2.6.5.1.4. (Added-WHITEMAN) Relabeling hazardous material containers in
          accordance with AFI 90-821, paragraph 2.6.1 when labels have been accidentally
          defaced or lost.
      2.6.5.2. (Added-WHITEMAN) The sources for this labeling information are:
          2.6.5.2.1. (Added-WHITEMAN) Hazardous Material Information System (HMIS)
          labeling field.
          2.6.5.2.2. (Added-WHITEMAN) Label on bulk or packaged containers.
          2.6.5.2.3. (Added-WHITEMAN) Hard copy of the manufacturer’s MSDS.
          2.6.5.2.4. (Added-WHITEMAN) Manufacturer, importer, or other responsible
          party.
      2.6.5.3. (Added-WHITEMAN) Label all tanks with the name of the material it
      contains. This will ensure non-compatible materials are not accidentally added to the
      tank or vat.
   2.6.6. Transfer of chemicals between containers.
      2.6.6.1. If an employee transfers a chemical from a labeled container (for example, a 55-
      gallon drum) into a portable container for the immediate use of the same employee who
      made the transfer, then the portable container does not need to be labeled according to
      HAZCOM requirements. Immediate use means that the hazardous chemical will be
      under the control of and used only by the person who transfers it from a labeled container
      and only within the work shift in which it is transferred. If the employee cannot maintain
      full control over the chemical or departs the work area/shop, and if there is residual
      material left in the portable container, this material shall either be disposed of under
      applicable local disposal regulations, returned to its original container, or labeled in
      accordance with applicable regulations.
      2.6.6.2. If a chemical is transferred from a labeled container into a portable container at a
      central distribution point, such as the installation or unit HAZMART, for use by other
      employees, then the portable container must be labeled by the HAZMART in accordance
      with HAZCOM requirements.
2.7. Employee Information and Training. The work area/shop supervisor is responsible for
ensuring all workers are properly trained on the chemical hazards in their work area/shop.
   2.7.1. Purpose. Supervisors and employees who handle, use, or are potentially exposed to
   hazardous materials in the course of official Air Force duties must be provided training on
   the AF HAZCOM program, including training to address work area/shop-specific hazards
   prior to the use of hazardous chemicals. Supervisors will ensure the appropriate functionals
AFI90-821_WHITEMANSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013                                                           19


  (i.e., PH, BE, base safety office, and fire department) review and approve the shop specific
  hazard training program for technical accuracy and completeness prior to implementation in
  the work area/shop. Contract supervisors and contractors shall be trained according to their
  specific contract provisions.
  2.7.2. Hazard Communication Training. Workers will be provided HAZCOM training prior
  to working with a material that could potentially create a health hazard, and when work
  area/shop conditions or hazardous materials change.
     2.7.2.1. Initial Training. Workers will receive comprehensive HAZCOM training from
     their supervisors at the time of their initial assignment in a work area/shop. This training,
     at a minimum, will include the following:
         2.7.2.1.1. Identification of operations or processes in the work area/shop where
         hazardous chemicals are present or used, and the complete list of hazardous material
         used in association with work area/shop processes.
         2.7.2.1.2. Identification of relevant hazard categories associated with each chemical
         used (e.g., flammability, carcinogenicity, etc.) or the individual chemical hazards;
         including, but not limited to, those with specific regulatory requirements (e.g.,
         asbestos, benzene, beryllium, cadmium, formaldehyde, and lead).
         2.7.2.1.3. The location and contents of the work area/shop-specific written hazard
         communication program.
         2.7.2.1.4. Proper labeling of hazardous materials.
         2.7.2.1.5. How to access and read MSDSs.
         2.7.2.1.6. Controls (engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal
         protective equipment) workers must use to minimize or eliminate exposure to
         hazardous chemicals specific to a task (e.g., the specific respirator for a specific spray
         painting process). Supervisors shall refer to the installation BE work area/shop
         survey reports for specific control requirements.
         2.7.2.1.7. Emergency procedures, such as recognition of a spill or accidental
         chemical release (e.g., visual, odor, alarm) and escape procedures to include the
         locations of emergency eye wash stations, showers, and monitoring capabilities.
         2.7.2.1.8. Chemical hazards associated with non-routine tasks (e.g., solvent tank
         change-out every three months).
     2.7.2.2. Supplemental Training. Training for all potentially affected employees is
     required when either a new hazard is brought into the work area/shop or a new chemical
     is introduced. The training shall include all elements described in Para. 2.7.2.
     Supervisors may use the AF Form 3952 or BE special survey letters as sources of
     information to meet this training requirement. When workers change work area/shops
     either by assigned duties or location, work area/shop-specific training as described in
     Para. 2.7.2.1 will be re-accomplished only to the extent needed to cover changes in
     working conditions and potential exposures.
  2.7.3. Activities Not Co-located. Air Force employees assigned to non-co-located activities,
  such as GOCO facilities, will be trained as GSUs (see Para. 2.7) or they may participate in
 20                                        AFI90-821_WHITEMANSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013


   that GOCO’s or other Services’ hazard communication training program, as long as the
   training meets the requirements of the Federal HAZCOM standard.
   2.7.4. Documentation of Hazard Communication Training. While the Federal HAZCOM
   standard does not require documentation of worker training, the Air Force, in accordance
   with AFI 91-301, as a good management practice, requires work area/shop supervisors to
   document both worker initial and supplemental hazard communication training on AF Form
   55 or in CAMS or in ESOH-MIS. This record should also include external HAZCOM
   training provided to AF supervisors and employees from contractor organizations where
   applicable.
   2.7.5. Determining the Effectiveness of Hazard Communication Training. HAZCOM is a
   performance-based standard. Therefore, the effectiveness of worker training will be
   measured by assessing worker knowledge of basic hazard communication concepts to
   include, but not be limited to:
      2.7.5.1. What processes and chemicals present hazards in their work area/shop and the
      nature of the hazard.
      2.7.5.2. How to access MSDSs for any chemical they use.
      2.7.5.3. How to find information on an MSDS.
      2.7.5.4. How to interpret the hazard symbols or wording on hazard labels and what
      precautions (e.g., engineering controls, personal protective equipment, etc.) they must use
      when working with hazardous chemicals.
2.8. Hazardous Chemical Inventory.
   2.8.1. The written work area/shop hazard communication program must include a list of the
   hazardous chemicals known to be present in a work area/shop (the list may be compiled for
   the work area/shop as a whole or for specified and readily distinguishable portions of a work
   area/shop). The identity that is used on the MSDS must be cross-referenced to the inventory.
   Where accessible, the inventory may be maintained in the ESOH-MIS.
   2.8.2. The inventory is a fundamental building block for a HAZCOM program and the
   nature of the chemicals on the inventory in a work area/shop will determine the scope of the
   hazard communication program and training requirements appropriate for that work
   area/shop. NOTE: IAW AFI 32-7086, the IHMP, through the AF Form 3952 authorization
   process, controls which hazardous chemicals can be used in each work area/shop on an
   installation.
2.9. Non-Routine Tasks Involving Hazardous Materials.
   2.9.1. Non-routine tasks are:
      2.9.1.1. Those tasks included within a work area/shop’s normal activities but performed
      infrequently, for example, cleaning a solvent tank and changing the solvent.
      2.9.1.2. Temporary duties outside an individual’s normal Air Force Specialty Code
      (AFSC) or job series.
   2.9.2. Supervisors will ensure work area/shop operating instructions (OI), specific task lists,
   and Job Safety Analyses (JSAs) thoroughly describe non-routine tasks, associated hazards,
AFI90-821_WHITEMANSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013                                                        21


   and controls, for the infrequent tasks covered under Para. 2.9.1. OIs do not need to be
   prepared if technical orders (TO) or other official documents adequately describe these tasks
   and associated hazards and controls. Supervisors will ensure workers review these
   procedures before performing the non-routine tasks.
   2.9.3. When workers temporarily perform duties outside their normal jobs, the supervisor of
   the gaining activity will ensure these workers receive the following training prior to
   beginning the activity:
       2.9.3.1. The initial HAZCOM training described in Para. 2.7.2.1 for workers not
       previously trained.
       2.9.3.2. Work area/shop-specific training, as necessary, on work area/shop-specific
       chemical hazards and associated controls.
2.10. Contractors in AF Work Area/Shop(s). When an Air Force work area/shop uses
hazardous chemicals in a way that contractor employees (e.g., a painting contractor working in
an industrial shop) may be exposed, then the work area/shop written hazard communication
program and access to MSDSs must be provided to the contractors in accordance with 29 CFR
1910.1200(e)(2). The contractor is responsible to determine the adequacy of the HAZCOM
information for assessments of contractor employees, and is responsible for their own HAZCOM
program.
2.11. Forms Prescribed. Air Force Form 55 (AF55), Employee Safety and Health Record;
Air Force Form 3952 (AF3952), Chemical/Hazardous Material Request/Authorization Form
2.12. (Added-WHITEMAN) HAZCOM Program Effectiveness. This is a performance-
oriented instruction. Primary focus is to reduce incidence of chemically-induced occupational
illnesses and injuries by information Whiteman AFB personnel of hazards associated with and
protective measures required when handling hazardous materials in their workplaces. Program
effectiveness will be assessed by observing work practices, testing worker HAZCOM
knowledge, and measuring occupational illness and injury rates.

or other appropriate form of warning which convey the specific physical and health hazard(s),
including target organ effects, of the chemical(s) in the container(s).
(Added-WHITEMAN) Hazardous Chemical or Hazardous Material— Any material, which
is a physical or health hazard and requires an MSDS as defined in Federal Standard 313, unless
excluded. The following items are not considered hazardous materials and are exempt: 1)
Hazardous wastes; 2) Tobacco; 3) Wood products; 4) Materials packaged for retail sale; 5)
Personal food, drugs, or cosmetics brought into the work area; 6) Consumer products used in
small quantities for non-occupational uses; 7) Chemicals used for laboratory analytical
processes; 8) Pharmaceuticals and biological materials, including serums and vaccines in their
final form.
HAZMART—As the customer service desk for the IHMP, it is the only entity on an installation
authorized to issue government-owned HAZMAT. At a minimum, a HAZMART is a facility or
location where customers can receive support for obtaining HAZMAT, and where HAZMATs
 26                                        AFI90-821_WHITEMANSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013


are managed and tracked. A HAZMART is intended to be the primary location on an installation
where LRS personnel stock, store, issue, and distribute HAZMAT. Each installation must have
at least one primary HAZMART established by, and accountable to the LRS Commander. The
HMMP team may designate additional unit-controlled supply activities as HAZMARTs
performing all the functions of the primary HAZMART. The HAZMART responsibilities
include the receipt and entry of data on Government-wide Purchase Card purchases of
HAZMAT, and the receipt and entry of data on contractor usage of HAZMAT.
Hazardous Chemical (HAZMAT)—Any chemical that is a physical or health hazard and
requires an MSDS as defined in AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management, and all Class I
and Class II ozone-depleting substances (ODS). Also known as hazardous material or
HAZMAT.
Hazardous Material Management Process—A standard methodology used to manage and
track the procurement and use of HAZMAT to support Air Force missions, protect the safety and
health of personnel on Air Force installations and communities surrounding Air Force
installations from misuse of HAZMAT, minimize Air Force use of HAZMAT consistent with
mission needs, and to maintain Air Force compliance with environmental requirements for
HAZMAT usage. The HMMP is composed of three interdependent programs: the Installation
Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) Pharmacy Program (IHMP), the Weapons System Hazardous
Material (HAZMAT) Program (WSHP), and the ODS Program (ODSP).
Health Hazard—Includes materials which are carcinogens, toxic or highly toxic agents,
reproductive toxins, irritants, corrosives, sensitizers, hepatotoxins, nephrotoxins, neurotoxins,
agents which act on the hematopoietic system, and agents which damage the lungs, skin, eyes, or
mucous membranes
Immediate Use Materials—Any hazardous chemical that will be under the control of and used
only by the person who transfers it from a labeled container and only within the work shift in
which it is transferred.
Installation—For purposes of the Federal HAZCOM standard and this AFI, an installation is a
single geographic location with one or more work area/shops. The AF does not constitute one
installation and must have programs that address hazards at each installation. Note: 29 CFR
1910.1200 uses the term workplace instead of installation.
Label—Any written, printed, or graphic material, displayed on or affixed to containers of
hazardous chemicals.
Laboratory—A facility where relatively small quantities of hazardous materials are used on a
non-production basis. Use of hazardous materials must meet all of the following conditions: i)
chemical manipulations are carried out on a laboratory scale with all work with substances in
containers designed to be easily and safely manipulated by one person; ii) Multiple chemical
procedures or chemicals are used; iii) Procedures involved are not part of a production process,
nor in any way simulate a production process; iv) Protective laboratory practices and equipment
are available.
Laboratory Standard—OSHA, 29 CFR 1910.1450, “Occupational Exposure to Hazardous
Chemicals in Laboratories.” See AFOSH Standard 48-22, Occupational Exposure to Hazardous
Chemicals in Laboratories.
AFI90-821_WHITEMANSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013                                                          27


Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)—Written or printed material concerning a hazardous
chemical that is prepared according to 29 CFR 1910.1200.
(Added-WHITEMAN) Non-routine Tasks— Those tasks included within a work area’s
normal activity but performed infrequently. For example, tasks performed less than three times
per year should be considered non-routine. Temporary duties outside an individual’s normal Air
Force Specialty Code (AFSC) or job series may be considered non-routine.
Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS)—Substances that are primarily Class I or Class II ODS as
defined by the “Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.”
Physical Hazard—Includes materials for which there is scientifically valid evidence it is a
combustible liquid, a compressed gas, explosive, flammable, an organic peroxide, an oxidizer,
pyrophoric, unstable (reactive) or water-reactive.
Produce—To manufacture, process, formulate, blend, extract, generate, emit, or repackage.
Responsible Party—Someone who can provide additional information on the hazardous
chemical and appropriate emergency procedures if necessary. This party is generally a
manufacturer’s representative.
(Added-WHITEMAN) Standard Use— Normally purchased to service specific equipment.
Trade Secret—Any confidential formula, pattern, process, device, or information or compilation
of information that is used in an employer’s business and that gives the employer an opportunity
to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it.
Use—To package, handle, react, emit, extract, generate as a by-product or transfer.
Work Area/Shop—A room or defined space in an installation where hazardous chemicals are
produced or used, and where employees are present. Note: Employees that often work outside
the physically defined work area, such as pest management personnel during pesticide
application or aircraft maintainers that take chemicals to the flightline, will have their hazards
addressed as part of the work area/shop program.

1.1. Introduction.

  1.1.1. Your rights: By law (29 CFR 1910.1200), you have the right and are required to
  receive information and training regarding the hazardous chemicals that you handle or work
  with. This information and training is the “Hazard Communication Program,” commonly
  referred to as HAZCOM. You may also hear it referred to as the “Right-to-know” program.
  This program deals specifically with your supervisor informing you of the hazardous
  chemicals within your workplace. It also provides you the training required to safely work
  with and around hazardous chemicals. You were first introduced to this program when you
  received the “Department of Defense Federal Hazard Communication Training Program.”
  The training you are about to receive is a continuation of that program and addresses the
  hazardous chemicals you will be exposed to, established protective measures, and how to find
  the information needed to protect yourself. You can expect to receive some aspect of this
  program for as long as you work with or around hazardous materials.

  1.1.2. Your Responsibilities: Under AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupational and Environmental
  Safety, Fire Protection, and Health (AFOSH) Program, you have specific responsibilities.
  You are required to follow the training you are given, comply with personal protective
  equipment requirements, including its use, inspection, and care, and give due consideration to
  personal safety and the safety of fellow workers.

  1.1.3. Methods of Recourse: If you feel you have not received information which you need
  or have a right to under the Hazard Communication Program, talk to your supervisor. You
  may contact Public Health at extension 687-4305.

  1.1.4. OSHA Expanded Standard Chemicals: Our shop will comply with OSHA expanded
  standard substance requirements contained in 29 CFR 1910.___, (Benzene, Cadmium, Lead,
  etc.). Our shop is current with annual training requirements. Expanded standard training is
  documented on the AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health as OSHA expanded standard
  chemical training.

1.2. Workplace Written Hazard Communication Program and Bioenvironmental Engineering Survey.

  1.2.1. We will begin today’s training by reviewing our “Work Center Specific Hazardous
  Chemical Training Booklet” and our Bioenvironmental Engineering Survey. These two
  documents will provide you with the background information on which we base today’s
  training.

1.4. Non-Routine Tasks Involving Hazardous Materials.

  1.4.1. A non-routine task is:

      1.4.1.1. A task included within the activities of a workplace but performed infrequently.

      1.4.1.2. A detail or temporary duty performed outside of an employee’s normal workplace
AFI90-821_WHITEMANSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013                                                               37


     or AFSC. This includes squadron and base details.

  1.4.2. Supervisors will ensure work area operation instructions (OIs) thoroughly describe
  non-routine tasks, associated hazards, and controls for the infrequent tasks listed in this
  section. OIs do not need to be prepared if technical orders (TOs), other official documents, or
  manufacturer’s instructions adequately describe these tasks. Supervisors will ensure workers
  review these procedures before performing the non-routine tasks.

  1.4.3. When workers temporarily perform duties outside their normal jobs, the supervisor of
  the activity will ensure these workers receive the following training prior to beginning the
  activity:

     1.4.3.1. The initial DoD HazCom Training Program if not previously trained.

     1.4.3.2. Supplemental training, as necessary, on work area specific chemical hazards and
     associated controls.

     1.4.3.3. The supervisor of the activity will forward a letter to the worker’s formal
     supervisor describing the training conducted so the individual’s AF Form 55 can be
     updated.

  1.4.4. Our-Non-Routine Tasks Are: (if non-routine tasks do not exist, the shop should
  write a bullet statement stating that your shop does not perform non-routine
  operations.)

Table 1.2. Our Workplace Non-Routine Tasks.

1.5. Material Safety Data Sheets.

  1.5.1. MSDS are designed to help you understand how to work safely with chemicals in your
  work area. Although MSDSs may vary in appearance and length, most MSDSs will have
  approximately 8 to 10 sections which explain the proper ways to handle and store chemicals
  in your work area. An MSDS also provides information on health hazards of the chemical,
  precautionary measures to follow, and emergency procedures.

     1.5.1.1. Know where the MSDS binder is kept (location of binder).

     1.5.1.2. MSDSs must be accessible to all personnel.

     1.5.1.3. HAVE AN MSDS AVAILABLE WHEN SEEKING MEDI
     CAL ATTENTION. Note: EXPLANATION OF THE MATERIAL SAFETY DATA
     SHEET: CHEMICAL IDENTIFICATION.
38                                             AFI90-821_WHITEMANSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013


       1.5.1.3.1. The introductory section of the MSDS includes the chemical manufacturer’s
       name, address and emergency phone number, the chemical name, trade name, and
       chemical formula. This section helps you identify the chemical on the MSDS.

 1.5.2. HAZARDOUS INGREDIENTS.

     1.5.2.1. This section lists any hazardous ingredients found within the chemical that can be
     hazardous to you. In this section you might also see the terms (Threshold Limit Value)
     TLV and (Permissible Exposure Limit) PEL. Both terms are used to express the airborne
     concentration levels of a C.A.S. (Chemical Abstract Service), which will usually be listed
     in this section the MSDS. The C.A.S. numbers identify specific chemicals according to
     information published by the American Chemical Society.

 1.5.3. PHYSICAL DATA.

     1.5.3.1. This section lists such important physical properties of the chemical as boiling
     point, vapor density, percent volatile, appearance and color, and other. This information
     helps determine the degree of hazards associated with the chemical in different work
     environments. For example, vapor density describes the weight of a vapor relative to an
     equal volume of air (air=1). If a chemical has a vapor density greater than 1, the vapor
     will be heavier than air and tends to fall and hug the ground.

 1.5.4. FIRE AND EXPLOSION DATA.

     1.5.4.1. This section helps you determine the chemical flash point, which is the
     temperature at which a chemical will release enough flammable vapors to ignite.
     Chemicals that ignite at or above 100F are classified as flammable. In addition, this
     section usually lists the chemical’s upper and lower flammability limits, proper types of
     extinguishing media required to safely extinguish the fire (example Co2, water, foam,
     etc.), special firefighting procedures, and any unusual fire and explosion hazards
     associated with the chemical.

 1.5.5. HEALTH HAZARD DATA.

     1.5.5.1. This section describes health effects associated with being overexposed to the
     chemical through ingestion, inhalation, and skin or eye contact. The information may
     include: the acute (immediate) and chronic (long term) effects of overexposure to the
     chemical, whether the chemical is a known carcinogen (cancer-causing agent), emergency
     and first aid procedures to follow in case of overexposure, whether overexposures may
     require immediate medical attention, and medical conditions that may be aggravated upon
     contact with the chemical. If you work in an area where overexposure is possible, safety
     equipment may be needed to protect you.

 1.5.6. REACTIVITY DATA.

     1.5.6.1. The information contained in this section helps you determine if the chemical will
     react with other chemical or conditions. Chemicals that are reactive (unstable) may
     explode, burn, or release toxic substances under certain conditions. In addition, this
AFI90-821_WHITEMANSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013                                                                 39


     section usually tells you if the chemical is stable or unstable and list any chemicals or
     substances that might be incompatible with the chemical.

  1.5.7. SPILL OR LEAK PROCEDURES.

     1.5.7.1. This section lists the procedures to follow when a chemical is accidentally
     released or spilled. It will also cover types of cleanup and protective equipment needed to
     safely contain or clean up a spill as well as proper ways to dispose of the chemical.

  1.5.8. SPECIAL PROTECTION INFORMATION.

     1.5.8.1. This section list the types of special protective equipment (respirators, gloves, eye
     protection, ventilation) that is recommended to be used when with the chemical.
     Remember, there are various types of protective equipment that are specially designed for
     certain tasks. Consult it with your supervisor to ensure you are using the correct type for
     the work you are performing.

  1.5.9. SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS.

     1.5.9.1. The last section usually discusses special precautions to be taken to during
     handling and storage of the chemical. Also, this section will usually discuss any other
     health or safety concerns that have not already mentioned in another section of the MSDS.

1.6. Labeling.

  1.6.1. To ensure employees are aware of all hazardous material within their workplace,
  OSHA requires all containers of hazardous materials brought into or used within a workplace
  to have the contents labeled, tagged, or marked.

     1.6.1.1. The chemical manufacturer, importer, or distributor is required to label, tag, or
     mark each container with:

        1.6.1.1.1. The identity of the hazardous material.

        1.6.1.1.2. Appropriate hazard warnings.

        1.6..1.1.3. Name, address, and phone number of the manufacturer, importer, or
        distributor.

    1.6.1.2. These labels, tags, or markings will not be removed, defaced, or changed. If it
    becomes necessary to replace a label, tag, or marking due to damage or loss, a
    DD Form 2521 (8” x 11”) or DD Form 2522 (4” x 6”), Hazardous Chemical Warning
    Label, will be used. One of these forms will also be used to meet the labeling
    requirements for existing stocks of unlabeled materials and for transferring, repackaging,
    or distributing of bulk quantities of hazardous materials into other containers (breakdown
    quantities).

  1.6.2. The supervisor will ensure that each container of hazardous chemicals in the workplace
 40                                              AFI90-821_WHITEMANSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013


  is labeled, tagged, or marked with:

      1.6.2.1. The identity of the hazardous chemical; and

      1.6.2.2. Appropriate hazard warnings.

      1.6.2.3. If the container is used or transported for use outside of the workplace, the name,
      duty section and phone number of the responsible individual will be included.

  1.6.3. Stationary containers may have their contents identified using signs, placards, or other
  such written material in place of labels as long as the alternative method identifies the
  container to which it is applicable.

  1.6.4. Small quantity containers, when filled, used, and emptied by one employee during one
  shift within the workplace, will be marked, as a minimum, with the name of the material in
  use. If these small quantity containers are filled from other containers, the source container
  will have the required OSHA markings.

  1.6.5. Warning labels may be formatted with either message or symbol which will identify
  the chemical and communicate the hazards of the chemical within the container. Labels may
  also address:

      1.6.5.1. First aid - The label may explain what to do if the chemical comes in contact with
      eyes or skin or if it is ingested or inhaled.

      1.6.5.2. Fire - The label may list the type of extinguisher to use if the chemical is
      flammable, and if it should catch fire.

      1.6.5.3. Spills - Some warning labels may contain information on how spills should be
      handled.

      1.6.5.4. Handling and Storage - The label will provide storage information and may list
      the type of personal protective equipment required to handle/use the chemical.

1.7. Physical and Health Hazards.

  1.7.1. The specific chemicals used during a particular operation or task will be addressed
  during the training or orientation for that operation or task.

  1.7.2. Consult label and MSDS for information on specific chemicals before handling or
  use.

1.8. Methods and Observations to Detect Presence or Release of a Hazardous Material in the
Workplace.

  1.8.1. Continuous Monitoring Devices:

      1.8.1.1. Monitoring Conducted by the Supervisor: Shift supervisors will do a walk around
AFI90-821_WHITEMANSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013                                                               41


     inspection at beginning and end of shift to check for any spilled or leaking hazardous
     chemicals.

       1.8.1.1.1. Supervisor will also monitor the physical appearance and mental status of
       personnel working with hazardous chemicals.

     1.8.1.2. Visual Appearance: Many chemicals have a distinct color and others, by their
     lack of color, could be visually confused with water. Certain colors can be distorted
     depending upon the lighting and the color of the material the chemical is in contact with.
     For these reasons, be extremely careful when attempting to identify an unknown spill by
     color alone.

     1.8.1.3. Odor: Chemicals can also have a distinctive smell, such as an oily, or alcohol-like
     smell. Unfortunately, some chemicals are nearly odorless. In these cases, remain aware of
     your or a co-worker’s physical reactions. Burning eyes, nose or throat, prickly skin, loss
     of coordination, and dizziness are a few signs of exposure to a hazardous chemical.

     1.8.1.4. Monitoring by Bioenvironmental Engineering: May be performed as a part of a
     special survey, when a new process or chemical is introduced into the workplace, or when
     over-exposure to a chemical is suspected.

1.9. Protective Measures.

  1.9.1. Controlling chemical hazards often require a combination of protective measures:
  administrative controls, engineering controls, and personal protective equipment. We will
  examine how these controls are used.

     1.9.1.1. Administrative Controls.

        1.9.1.1.1. Information and Training: In order to recognize the need for protection
        against a hazard, you need to be aware that a hazard exists. This information is passed
        to you through Hazard Communication Training, technical data, and on-the-job training
       (OJT).

       1.9.1.1.2. Safe Work Practices: Through information and training, you learn the safe
       work practices to use with chemicals you will use or be exposed to. Common sense
       also goes a long way.

       1.9.1.1.3. Good Housekeeping and Personal Hygiene: The goal of good housekeeping
       is to contain and remove hazards through proper storage, proper cleanup, and the
       prompt removal and correct disposal of chemical wastes. Correct personal hygiene
       around hazardous chemicals involves washing your hands before eating, drinking, or
       smoking, prompt removal of contaminated clothing, and cleaning of the clothing before
       wearing again.

       1.9.1.1.4. Environmental, Medical, and Personal Monitoring: In some workplaces, the
       hazard of a chemical used requires the use of machines to monitor the air to warn of
       possible overexposure. Another method is physical exams of the personnel to detect
 42                                              AFI90-821_WHITEMANSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013


        adverse health conditions, both before allowing exposure to a chemical and at specific
        intervals while working with a chemical. In all workplaces, monitoring by the workers
        and the supervisors for poor work practices, poor housekeeping, and damaged
        equipment is the first line of defense against unprotected exposure to hazardous
        chemicals.

      1.9.1.2. Engineering Controls.

        1.9.1.2.1. Substitution: Finding a less hazardous chemical used within a process,
        finding a less hazardous process, or finding a less hazardous piece of equipment.

        1.9.1.2.2. Isolation: Using barriers or enclosures to separate the employee from the
        hazard. Examples within this work area are: List specific examples that apply in the
        workplace.

        1.9.1.2.3. Ventilation: Providing a constant source of fresh air to the work area or
        removing airborne hazards at the source. Examples within this work area are: List
        specific industrial ventilation systems used in the workplace and what exposures
        they are used to control. Note: Bioenvironmental Engineering will be consulted
        before initiating any changes in the ventilation system.

      1.9.1.3. Personal Protective Equipment: Bioenvironmental (BE) provides an authorized
      PPE listing as an attachment to their industrial hygiene survey. In addition, technical data
      and MSDSs will specify the protective equipment necessary while using specific
      chemicals. The protective equipment used in this work center is annotated in Table A.3.

      1.9.1.4. Emergency Procedures: When controls fail or there is an accidental release of a
      hazardous chemical, emergency actions to safeguard life and property must be taken.
      Work area personnel do/do not (circle appropriate word) use large quantities of hazardous
      materials. Most spills are cleaned up on the spot by following the Hazardous Material
      Spill Cleanup Procedures, which are reviewed prior to working with any chemical. An
      emergency eyewash is available in ____________________________________ for
      accidental contact and a shower is available in
      _____________________________________. Immediately after flushing the exposed
      area for 15 minutes, personnel involved will be taken to the Emergency Room for further
      evaluation. Additionally, work area personnel receive in-service training on responding to
      hazardous material spills. If, at any time, there is a spill, which is beyond our capabilities,
      work area personnel will evacuate the building and call the Fire Emergency Services for
      assistance.

1.10. Conclusion.

  1.10.1. Supplemental Training. Training for all potentially affected employees is required
  when a new hazard is brought into the work area/shop, a new chemical is introduced, and/or
  the shop uses chemicals regulated under an OSHA Expanded Standard regulation that
  requires supplemental training. The training shall include all elements described in
  AFI 90-821 Para. 2.7.2. Supervisors may use BEF special survey letters or training material
  provided by Public Health Flight as sources of information to meet this training requirement.
AFI90-821_WHITEMANSUP_I 21 MARCH 2013                                                              43


 When workers change work area/shops either by assigned duties or location, work area/shop
 specific training as described in AFI 90-821 Para. 2.7.2.1. will be re-accomplished only to the
 extent needed to cover changes in working conditions, potential exposures, and OSHA
 expanded standard requirements.

 1.10.2. Documentation of Hazard Communication Training. While the Federal
 HAZCOM standard does not require documentation of worker training, the Air Force, in
 accordance with AFI 91-301, as a good management practice, requires work area/shop
 supervisors to document both worker initial and supplemental hazard communication training
 on AF Form 55 or in CAMS or in ESOH-MIS. This record should also include external
 HAZCOM training provided to AF supervisors and employees from contractor organizations
 where applicable.

 1.10.3. We’ve covered some very important information today, information which will
 permit you to do your job safely and avert health problems in later years.

   1.10.3.1. You should now know and understand:

      1.10.3.1.1. Your personal rights and responsibilities under OSHA.

      1.10.3.1.2. HazCom requirements that apply to your job and workplace.

      1.10.3.1.3. The chemical hazards of your workplace.

      1.10.3.1.4. Personal Protective Equipment that you need, where to get it, how to use it,
      and how to maintain it.

      1.10.3.1.5. How to identify and report hazards.

      1.10.3.1.6. Emergency procedures that apply to your job and workplace.

   1.10.4. If you have any doubts or questions, ask your supervisor to go over the material
   again. Don’t shortchange yourself, your family, or the Air Force.

1. “Consumer Commodity” means product is used in the work center in the same manner as it would be
used for household use, with similar duration and frequency of exposure; determination is made item
by item by work center supervisor (Reference AFOSH Std 161-21, Page 2).
2. Consumer use items are exempt from Hazard Communication program (no MSDS required); work
centers, however, must identify these items on a separate list in their HAZCOM binder.
3. List DOES NOT exempt item from separate storage, compatibility and disposal requirements.
4. Cannot stockpile consumer use items; general guidance is two containers allowed per shop.
5. Standard Use means normally purchased to service specific equipment.
