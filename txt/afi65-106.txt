                                       GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. Scope. This instruction provides detailed Air Force financial guidance on APF support to Air
Force Services programs, activities, and NAFIs. For additional information regarding nonappropriated
fund (NAF) support, classification and operations of Air Force Services programs, see AFI 34-201, Use
of Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs). In cases of conflict with other Air Force instructions on using APFs
to support Air Force Services, this instruction takes precedence. In the event of conflict with other
instructions, submit an advisory through established command channels to SAF/FMC for appropriate
review and coordination including SAF/FMB.
   1.1.1. Personnel Authorization . Additional personnel authorizations or requirements shall not be
   programmed or allocated based on this instruction.
   1.1.2. Use of Appropriated Funds . To most efficiently utilize NAF resources, expenses should be
   paid from APFs where authorized within limits imposed by availability of resources.
1.2. Objective. The Air Force promotes and provides a well-rounded Air Force Services program to
ensure the mental and physical well-being of its personnel. Adequate facilities should be provided,
operated, and maintained through financial support provided from APFs as authorized by law.
Depending upon the category, some Air Force Services activities may be fully supported with APFs,
some with a combination of APFs and NAFs, and some primarily with NAFs.
1.3. Comptroller Responsibilities. Air Force Financial Management/Comptroller and Air Force Ser-
vices offices provide policy on APF support of Air Force Services activities. No use of APFs may be
approved beyond what is authorized by this instruction. All questions or requests for expanded direction
will be made to SAF/FMC with appropriate coordination through MAJCOM and HAF.
   1.3.1. The Comptroller community must develop, coordinate, and provide procedures for financial
   oversight and guidance to commanders and services functional managers on using APFs to support
   Air Force Services activities within the limitations established by the Congress, the Secretary of
   Defense, and the Secretary of the Air Force.
   1.3.2. The Comptroller's office must ensure obligations are accurately reported in accordance with
   funding limitations and all applicable Air Force guidance.
1.4. Categories of Air Force Services Activities. Services activities are grouped into three categories:
Category A, "Mission Sustaining Activities"; Category B, "Basic Community Support Activities"; and
Category C, "Revenue Generating Activities". Support categories are based on the activity and not the
facility. A facility may house several different activities with each classed in a different support
category. See Table 2.1. for a list of Air Force Services activities by Category.
1.5. Direct Support. Field organizations must control and report direct costs in support of Air Force
Services activities. See Table 1.1. for a general list of direct cost elements.
1.6. Indirect Support. Indirect support which does not require hiring additional APF personnel or
securing additional services are not reported by field units. SAF/FMC computes and reports indirect
support costs to the Office of the Secretary of Defense. See Table 1.2. for a general listing of indirect
cost elements.

provide services to AF Services activities on a reimbursable basis. Bases must identify materials,

                                               Chapter 2

                                CLASSIFICATION OF ACTIVITIES

2.1. Classification of Activities. Air Force Services activities are classified into three categories for
determining the source of funding support authorized for each. See Table 2.1. for a list of Air Force
Services activities by category.
   2.1.1. Category A, Mission Sustaining Activities. These activities are essential to the military
   mission and must be provided in all but the most extenuating conditions, i.e., contingency
   operations. Consequently, these programs are authorized to receive maximum APF support. They
   also have the least capacity to generate revenue. The Air Force goal is 100 percent APF support
   where authorized for Category A activities. Common support activities such as Resource
   Management (RM) and Human Resource Office (HRO) are grouped in Category A for reporting
   purposes only. APF support is based on the functions performed by these activities. For purposes of
   Executive Control and Command Supervision (ECCS), APF support is authorized for equipment
   (including data automation equipment).
   2.1.2. Category B, Basic Community Support Activities. These activities have the capacity to
   generate some NAF revenue. They may be provided substantial support from APFs. This category
   includes essential Air Force Services activities that provide a fundamental core of the Services
   programs at Air Force installations. The Air Force goal for APF support of Category B activities is a
   minimum of 50 percent of direct costs.
   2.1.3. Category C, Revenue-Generating Activities. These activities have the highest capacity to
   generate revenue and are considered self-sustaining, capable of funding most expenses. Category C
   activities are considered desirable to the military community and make major contributions to
   mission accomplishment and personnel recruitment and retention. Category C activities are
   authorized indirect APF support and limited direct APF support. For example, direct APF support is
   authorized to correct health and safety deficiencies. Category C programs at designated remote and
   isolated locations are authorized the same type of funding as Category B programs. See Paragraph
   3.1. for funding details and Table 3.1. for a list of approved remote and isolated locations.
2.2. Supplemental Mission Support NAF Activities. These activities include all NAFIs providing
MWR services that supplement the mission of training, health, lodging, or other appropriated funded
programs. Examples include the lodging fund, Fisher House Fund, in-flight meal service and the U.S.
Air Force Academy Athletic Association. The only APF support costs reportable for these activities are
direct costs related to NAFI operating functions.
2.3. Concessions and Resale Activities. Classify snack bars, soda fountains, health bars, recreation
equipment rental, arts and craft resale, and other concessions, whether standing alone or collocated with
Category A or B activities, as Category C activities for determining APF support. As an example, while
equipment issue operations are considered Category B, collocation of this function with the recreation
equipment rental activity does not authorize additional APF support for equipment rental. Utility costs
for Category C functions may be funded with APFs as directed in Attachment 2, paragraph 7. When
utilities are funded with NAFs and meters are not used, follow procedures in AFI 32-1061 to estimate
utility consumption. See Table 2.2. for a list of activities.
2.4. Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) Activities. With the exceptions noted below,
APF support may be provided to AAFES activities at the same level as that provided to Air Force
10                                                                            AFI65-106 6 May 2009

                         REMOTE AND/OR ISOLATED LOCATIONS

3.1. Level of Appropriated Fund Support. With the exceptions noted below, Category C activities at
approved remote and isolated locations are authorized Category B level APF support based on
availability of resources at each location. Table 3.1. identifies remote and/or isolated locations.
EXCEPTION: Don't provide Category B level APF support for:
   3.1.1. Equipment and supplies for AAFES.
   3.1.2. Equipment utilized for generating revenue or for providing a paid service (such as reach-in
   coolers, walk-in refrigerators, stoves, golf carts, amusement machines, slot machines, horses,
   airplanes, and guns).
   3.1.3. Additional telephone service above that authorized for Category C activities at other
   locations.
3.2. Procedures in Requesting Remote and Isolated Status. The installation level FSS/CC prepares a
Remote and Isolated Package (see DoDI 1015.10 Enclosure 5 for major factors to be addressed when
requesting R & I status).
   3.2.1. The package should include a background paper with a narrative justification for the request
   and specific information showing how the installation qualifies based on the criteria contained in
   DoDI 1015.10, paragraph E5.2. and its subparagraphs.
   3.2.2. Packages must be coordinated with installation FM and approved by the installation
   commander prior to forwarding to the MAJCOM/A1S. The MAJCOM/A1S obtains MAJCOM/FM
   coordination on the package prior to forwarding it to HQ AFSVA for review. HQ AFSVA evaluates
   the request and forwards the package to HQ USAF/A1S for review. HQ USAF/A1S evaluates the
   request and forwards the package with its recommendation to SAF/FMC for review. SAF/FMC
   evaluates the request and forwards the package with its recommendation to SAF/MRM. SAF/MRM
   evaluates the request and makes a final recommendation to SAF/FM who forwards the package with
   its recommendation to Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense, Personnel and Readiness
   (P&R) for final action.

                                               Chapter 4

                        MILITARY AND CIVILIAN PERSONNEL COSTS

4.1. General Guidance. Military and APF civilian personnel cannot be employed in Category C
activities while on duty. EXCEPTIONS:
   4.1.1. Military and APF civilian personnel are authorized for ECCS.
   4.1.2. Military and APF civilian personnel at approved remote and isolated locations when
   authorized on the Unit Manpower Document (UMD).
   4.1.3. Military and APF civilian personnel at deployed and contingency locations, e.g., Field
   Exchanges.
   4.1.4. Military and APF civilian personnel scheduled to deploy may work one time up to 45 days in
   a Category C activity no earlier than 90 days before deploying in order to gain experience in cash
   handling, merchandising, advertising, etc.
4.2. Dual Compensation. Enlisted military and APF civilian personnel generally may work in Air
Force Services activities during off-duty hours as NAF civilian employees. In the case of APF civilian
personnel, the aggregate hours worked (APF and NAF) cannot exceed 40 hours per week. For example,
full time APF employees may not work off-duty as a NAF civilian employee. Off duty military
personnel work will not exceed 34 hours per week as a NAF employee. The local Staff Judge Advocate
reviews each case to assure that dual compensation laws are not violated.
4.3. Accounting for Personnel Costs. All activities must account for costs of military and APF
civilian personnel whose assigned duties in support of Air Force Services are 25 percent or more of their
total duty time. Report costs in proportion to the amount of time spent supporting Air Force Services,
e.g., external organizations such as Base Communication Squadrons or Base Civil Engineers who spend
25 percent or more of their time in support of Air Force Services.
   4.3.1.          Use      the   official  OUSD(C)        military     composite      rates    at
   http://www.defenselink.mil/comptroller/rates to compute the costs that must be reported as APF
   support to Air Force Services.
   4.3.2. Military personnel and TDY costs, when part of a Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) exercise, must
   be identified by a separate JCS Emergency and Special Program (ESP) code and not be charged as
   Air Force Services support.
   4.3.3. Military personnel are authorized in exchanges and other Category C functions for ECCS to
   provide a trained cadre to meet wartime and deployment requirements. These costs are reported as
   direct APF support.
   4.3.4. APF Civilian Personnel costs will be computed using standard rate in AFI 65-503, Table 26-
   1.
4.4. Reimbursing Personnel Costs.
   4.4.1. For work that is not reported, use the civilian standard rate in AFI 65-503, Table 26-1,
   applicable to work performed for another DoD agency to compute the amount to reimburse APFs
   from NAFs. The civilian standard rate includes factors for annual leave, holidays, sick leave and
   contributions for group life insurance, retirement, and health benefits.
16                                                                               AFI65-106 6 May 2009


     4.4.2. Total actual cost to the federal government is reimbursed for local wage rate employees (e.g.,
     wage board authority) and foreign nationals.
        4.4.2.1. Use approved shop rates when reimbursing civil engineering work.
        4.4.2.2. See AFIs 32-1022 and 32-1032 for guidance on the use of military labor to support Air
        Force Services facility projects.
4.5. Transportation Costs for NAF Employees. Transportation costs for NAF employees are funded
from the same source as NAF salaries. However, APF funds may be used for transportation costs for
NAF employees that comply with the Department of Defense Transportation Incentive Program and for
costs that are the direct result of BRAC actions or the result of acts of God, fire, or terrorism.

                                                Chapter 5

                                 CHILD AND YOUTH PROGRAMS

5.1. General Guidance. It is DoD and Air Force policy that APF direct support for the child develop-
ment program must be at least equal to parent fees collected. Appropriated general and administrative
(G&A) costs such as comptroller support, installation security, facilities engineering, legal services, fire
protection, utilities, custodial services, refuse collection, snow removal, and similar types of base
support functions should not be counted as part of the APF direct support.
   5.1.1. Parent fees may only be used to pay caregiver wages, for consumable supplies, and for food
   program expenses not covered by APF. Consumable supplies are supplies that are consumed as used
   such as paper, crayons, office supplies, etc.
5.2. Funding for Child Development Programs. Funding for child care operating expenses has been
allocated as a separate program element (XXX19F) in the budget subactivity group for base support.
   5.2.1. Funding for items such as utilities, minor construction, custodial service and equipment will
   remain in base operation program elements and other appropriations. Table 5.1. provides a matrix
   that indicates the fund source for child care costs.
   5.2.2. For reporting purposes, accumulate all APF costs for child care services in RC/CCs XX45F2,
   XX45F3 and XX45F4. Use ESP code “VC” to control and report the APF obligations for the child
   development centers, ESP code “WC” for the family child care and child-related services, “UC” for
   youth programs, and “SA” for school-age care.
   5.2.3. SAF/FMC will report indirect support for child care programs. See AFI 34-248, Child
   Development Centers, and AFI 34-249, Youth Programs for additional guidance.
   5.2.4. In addition to expenses authorized in Table 5.1. APFs may be used for the following child
   care requirements:
       5.2.4.1. Operation of the center during alerts, national emergencies, inspections, mobilizations,
       deployments, and other special conditions as determined by the installation commander.
       5.2.4.2. National accreditation of child development and school-age centers required by Air
       Force policy.
       5.2.4.3. Training requirements of the Military Child Act, including training equipment and sup-
       plies, tuition, and instructors or consultants.
       5.2.4.4. Parent participation program as required by the Military Child Care Act.
       5.2.4.5. Purchase of fixed installation surveillance closed circuit television (CCTV) to enhance
       the level of supervision at base child development centers and school age child care programs.
       5.2.4.6. Cable television (installation, maintenance and monthly service charges).
       5.2.4.7. Civilian uniforms (approved in accordance with AFI 36-801, Uniforms for Civilian
       Employees) or other identifying apparel used in child development centers, school age child care
       programs and youth programs, designed to identify to the general public the staff authorized to
       provide care and supervision of children and youth.
5.3. Funding for Youth Programs. Funding for Youth Programs may be resourced from APF or NAF
depending on the nature of the expenditure. Youth Programs are a Category B activity supported with a
      18                                                                              AFI65-106 6 May 2009


      substantial amount of APF support in addition to revenues generated from parent fees. This chapter does
      not apply to Youth Programs unless specifically stated. As a category B activity, fund sources for Youth
      Programs are provided as indicated in Attachment 2 of this instruction and Table 5.2.
      5.4. School Age Program (Before and After School, Full-Day, Holiday, and Summer Camps).
      This program is part of the overall child development program but is operated by Youth Programs, not
      as a sub-activity of the child development center. APF support costs are reported separately from child
      development centers and there is no requirement to match parent fees with APF support. The school age
      care program is a Category B activity operated in the Youth Center or other suitable sites with a
      combination of APF and NAF.
             5.4.1.1. APF support is provided as indicated in Table 5.3.
             5.4.1.2. APF direct support is reported separately from child development centers and family
             child care programs in RC/CC XX45F5. Use ESP code “SA” to control and report APF
             obligations.
             5.4.1.3. Contract full-day summer camps are operated with a combination of APFs and NAFs.
             See Table 5.3.
             5.4.1.4. Ground transportation for field trips for educational programs is authorized to be
             provided with APF resources. Transportation for field trips for entertainment such as theme
             parks, must be provided from NAFs. Transportation to and from school normally is provided by
             designating the school age program locations as bus stops for school district, DoDDS, etc. If
             there is a demonstrated need for additional transportation services to and from school, NAFs can

                                                Chapter 6

                               AIR FORCE LODGING FUND SOURCE

6.1. Scope. The guidance in this Chapter applies to lodging facilities for permanent change of station
(PCS) and temporary duty (TDY) travel. The Air Force classifies these activities as services and reports
APF support separately from Air Force Services.
     6.1.1. The Air Force classifies recreational lodging facilities such as cabins at off-base recreation
     sites as Air Force Services Category C revenue-generating activities.
6.2. Managing Lodging Funds. Lodging funds are supplemental mission support NAFIs that generate
NAF revenues from service charges paid by authorized personnel residing in lodging facilities, and from
sundry sales, interest income, concessions and other income.
     6.2.1. Service charges must be established at a level sufficient to pay the costs of operations where
     NAF is the fund source in Table 6.1.
     6.2.2. Lodging NAFs cannot be used to fund APF requirements and must be managed and
     accounted for separately from the installation's single MWR fund.
     6.2.3. Transfers between lodging funds and other NAFIs are not authorized. However, purchases
     between NAFIs at fair market value are permitted in accordance with AFI 34-204.
6.3. Using a Single Fund Source. To prevent budgeting the same expense from APFs and NAFs, use
the single fund source identified in Table 6.1. for operation, maintenance, repair, construction, furniture,
fixture and equipment expenditures.
     6.3.1. When the fund source is APF, NAFs are not authorized and vice versa without a waiver.
     6.3.2. Send requests to waive the single fund source requirement to SAF/FMCEB through
     MAJCOM A1S/FM, HQ AFSVA and HQ USAF/A1S.
6.4. Managing Lodging Service Charges. Service charges must not be set at rates which lead to cash
accumulations above 10 percent of annual costs for those expenses paid by NAFs as identified in Table
6.1. See AFMAN 34-214, Procedures for Nonappropriated Funds Financial Management and
Accounting, for NAF accounting guidance and procedures for the lodging fund, and AFI 34-201, Use of
Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs), for authorized uses of NAFs.
     6.4.1. If cash accumulations of NAF funds exceed the 10 percent level at the end of a fiscal year, the
     lodging service charge for the succeeding fiscal year must be reduced to a level sufficient to lower
     the accumulation below 10 percent.
     6.4.2. The 10 percent available cash limit applies to the centralized Air Force Lodging Fund (AFLF)
     as a whole and not to individual bases.
        6.4.2.1. Available cash cannot exceed 10 percent of the annual operating budget and one year's
        capital requirements.
        6.4.2.2. Under the centralized AFLF concept, cash above immediate operational needs at bases
        is withdrawn to fund high dollar capital expenditures and bulk supply items. All remaining
        resources at base level are applied to fund annual operating and low cost capital requirements.
6.5. Developing APF and NAF Budgets. Lodging managers develop the APF and NAF budgets con-
currently with the APF financial plan for the budget execution year.
AFI65-106 6 May 2009                                                                                   29


   6.5.1. The installation commander submits the APF budget to the MAJCOM. The base lodging
   manager submits the annual NAF budget to HQ AFSVA for review, approval, and development of
   proposed Air Force lodging rates. Quarterly budget updates are retained at base-level.
   6.5.2. HQ AFSVA must consolidate the annual base lodging budgets and evaluate both the current
   and projected command cash positions before decisions can be made on rates. Also, if there are
   items that cannot be funded from APF (lack of funds or other reasons), the MAJCOM/FM in
   coordination with the MAJCOM/A1S may request waivers to the funding matrix from
   SAF/FMCEB. See waiver request instructions in paragraph 6.7.
6.6. Approval of Air Force Lodging Rates. AFSVA/CC submits an AFLF rate computation package
biennially to SAF/FMC through AF/A1S.
   6.6.1. SAF/FMC, in coordination with SAF/FMB, reviews the rate computation packages, and
   approves or revises them as appropriate.
6.7. Waivers to Lodging Fund Source Guidance. There may be some expenses paid from APF or
NAF where the fund source identified in Table 6.1 is not practical or possible due to insufficient funds
or other conditions. Send waiver requests for specific cases to SAF/FMCEB through the MAJCOM/FM
and MAJCOM/A1S, HQ AFSVA and AF/A1S. EXCEPTION: The approval authority for waiver of
fund source for construction is OSD, except for OCONUS youth facilities and VQs.
   6.7.1. Types of Waivers to be Considered:
       6.7.1.1. Insufficient APFs. If the MAJCOM cannot fund shortfalls, its Comptroller may
       request a waiver. For a waiver based on insufficient APFs, MAJCOMs must:
           6.7.1.1.1. Identify item(s) to be funded from NAFs.
           6.7.1.1.2. State whether the waiver request applies to a single or multiple bases or the entire
           MAJCOM. Under the centralized AFLF concept, items to be funded from NAF as a result of
           the waiver should apply to all bases within the MAJCOM unless there are unusual
           circumstances that would preclude it. Include a certification that APFs are unavailable.
       6.7.1.2. Contractor Operated Lodging Operations, or Other Contracts. Applies to NAF or
       APF contracts that cannot be converted to the appropriate fund source. The waiver will be valid
       for the life of the contract. The waiver requests must include the purpose of the contract and the
       contract expiration date.
       6.7.1.3. Other Reasons: For waivers for other reasons than those in paragraphs 6.7.1.1. and
       6.7.1.2 the request with justification goes to the MAJCOM/FM and MAJCOM/A1S, HQ
       AFSVA, and AF/A1S for staffing and can be disapproved at any of those levels. If not
       disapproved, the request is forwarded to SAF/FMC for approval/disapproval.
6.8. Processing Waivers. Each waiver request will describe the potential impact on lodging operations
and service charge rates.
   6.8.1. Each request with justification goes to the MAJCOM/A1S/FM, HQ AFSVA, and HQ
   USAF/A1S for staffing and can be disapproved at any of those levels. If not disapproved, the request
   is forwarded to SAF/FMC for approval/disapproval. If forwarded to SAF/FMC, each request will be
   coordinated with other appropriate HQ USAF staff offices and will be approved or disapproved by
   SAF/FMC.
   6.8.2. SAF/FMC granted waivers normally cover the fiscal year. EXCEPTION: Waivers may
   cover other time periods as SAF/FMC determines and states in the approval memorandum.
     30                                                                                AFI65-106 6 May 2009


          6.8.3. After SAF/FMC approves or disapproves the waiver request, the APF and NAF budgets are
          adjusted accordingly.
          6.8.4. MAJCOMs allow 30 days for review and staffing of waiver requests.

                                  FISHER HOUSE FUNDING GUIDANCE

   7.1. Scope. The guidance in this section applies to Fisher Houses & Fisher Suites (FHs & FSs). These
   houses support the patients and their families who use military treatment facilities (MTFs).
        7.1.1. The local MTF Commander controls the operation of these houses.
        7.1.2. The FSS Commander/Director/Division Chief provides accounting, contracting and financial
        management support.
        7.1.3. Although the Air Force classifies these activities as services, do not report APF support as Air
        Force Services.
        7.1.4. The Installation Commander supports FH&FS with a combination of APF and NAF. See
        Table 7.1 for funding guidance on the construction, maintenance, repair, and operation of these
        facilities.
   7.2. Supplemental Mission Support Funds. The Air Force Fisher House Fund (AFFHF) is an Air
   Force Supplemental Mission Support NAFI. Its operations at installation level are carried out through
   subaccounts of the AFFHF. Installation subaccount NAF revenues come from service charges collected
   from authorized personnel residing in the houses, sundry sales, interest income, donations, contributions,
   and other income.
        7.2.1. The MTF Commander establishes service charges and fees to pay NAF operating expenses
        (see Table 7.1). NAFs may be accumulated to maintain stable rates and to provide for capital
        expenditures.
   7.3. Single Fund Source. To prevent budgeting the same expenditure using APFs and NAFs, the local
   MTF commander must use a single fund source for each element of operation, maintenance, repair, and
   construction costs. When the fund source is APF, NAFs are not authorized and vice-versa without a
   waiver to the fund source.
        7.3.1. SAF/FMC approves requests for fund source waivers. Installation Services submits requests
        for exceptions to these funding policies directly to HQ AFSVA for review. HQ AFSVA then
        forwards recommendations for approval to HQ USAF/A1S and SAF/FMCEB, in turn. Each
        organization level (AFSVA and HQ USAF/A1S) may disapprove requests without forwarding the
        request to the next organization level. Only recommendations for approval should be forwarded to
        the next higher organization level.

                              OUTDOOR RECREATION PROGRAMS

8.1. Scope. Outdoor recreation programs provide a variety of Category A, B and C activities utilizing
on-base and off-base facilities. Commanders base APF support (personnel, equipment, facilities, and so
on) on the activity and not the facility. You must classify programs as Categories A, B or C, and use
APFs accordingly. See Table 8.1 for examples of outdoor recreation activities by Category.
8.2. Using APFs for Personnel, Supplies, Utilities, and Other Support. Authorize APF support in
accordance with Attachment 2. EXCEPTION: See paragraphs 8.3 and 8.4 for equipment loan and
equipment rental, respectively.
8.3. APFs for Recreation Equipment Loan Operations. Authorize APFs for recreation equipment
loan items such as tents, coolers, sleeping bags, camp stoves, skis, canoes, small fishing boats (16 ft. and
below) and other equipment for the outdoor recreation program.
   8.3.1. Using NAFs in lieu of authorized APFs requires a waiver to fund source in accordance with
   AFI 34-262, Services Programs and Use Eligibility.
   8.3.2. Don't use APF equipment loan items to generate profit.
   8.3.3. Charge fees to recover only verifiable NAF costs, such as cleaning, servicing, or
   administering APF equipment items.
8.4. NAFs for Recreation Equipment Rental Operations. Rental equipment must be purchased with
NAFs. Rental equipment may include such items as lawn mowers, rototillers, chain saws, large
watercraft, and trailers for overnight lodging.
8.5. Privately Owned Equipment. APFs may not be used for storage or to provide other support for
privately owned recreation equipment (for example: boats, ski mobiles, travel trailers, recreation
vehicles, etc.).
8.6. Recreational Swimming Pools. Classify all Air Force Services swimming pools as Category B,
recreational swimming pools. Authorize APFs for utilities, maintenance and repair, supplies, equipment
and lifeguards. Hire APF lifeguards as overhires or temporaries since HQ USAF will not provide end-
strength or dollars for these positions. If APFs are not available and circumstances warrant, a waiver to
use NAFs may be requested. Use of a NAF MOA supported with APFs is authorized.
   8.6.1. When a pool is linked to a revenue-generating activity such as a club, and its use is strictly
   limited to the members of the activity, do not use APFs.
   8.6.2. You may use APFs for pools collocated with clubs but open to non-members.
8.7. Off-Base Outdoor Recreation Programs. Classify recreation sites that primarily provide
overnight lodging or other revenue-generating activities in their entirety as Category C. When
recreation sites contain a mix of Category A, B, and C programs, you must classify each program area
by the MWR category. Use Attachment 2 for the appropriate fund source.

                                                Chapter 9

                     CONTRACTING FOR PHYSICAL FITNESS SERVICES

9.1. Objective and Scope. Service members must possess the stamina and strength to complete
missions successfully. The DoD uses APFs to provide the necessary physical fitness training areas and
facilities. When these military training areas and facilities are not available to individual Service
members due to their particular assignment, you may use APFs to procure alternate means of physical
fitness training.
9.2. Commercial Fitness Services. Where military facilities are not available, you may use APFs for
contracting with community recreation centers, Young Men's Christian Associations, Young Women's
Christian Associations, city, county, state, or private fitness facilities for organizational memberships for
fitness by military personnel and authorized civilian personnel.
   9.2.1. You may use APFs to contract for gymnasiums, running tracks, athletic fields, shower and
   locker facilities, recreation centers, and community centers, including swimming pools that are an
   integral part of these physical fitness facilities.
       9.2.1.1. Don't use APFs or NAFs to fund individual memberships for the use of swimming
       facilities not included as part of a gymnasium, recreation center, or community center, health
       spas, golf courses, bowling centers, sporting clubs, tennis courts, and racquet clubs.
   9.2.2. Civilian employees may use these facilities for physical fitness, if their use does not increase
   the cost to or compromise access by active duty military.
   9.2.3. Family members of active duty and Reserve component personnel may use these facilities for
   physical fitness if their use does not increase contract costs or compromise access by active duty
   military or DoD civilian employees.
9.3. Approval Procedures. Because of the sensitive nature of contracting for memberships to physical
fitness centers, HQ USAF must approve each contract on a case-by-case basis.
   9.3.1. The base submits a request to its MAJCOM, HQ AFSVA, HQ USAF/A1S, and SAF/FMC in
   turn. The request must address the following issues: why DoD physical fitness facilities are
   unavailable or inadequate; the local circumstances and commuting distance to the nearest military
   installation that has a physical fitness facility; that adequate fitness facilities are not available
   without cost to military personnel in the civilian community where they are assigned; approximately
   how many military service members would participate in a contracted physical fitness facility that
   would result in a cost effective contract; whether it is more cost-effective to build or lease facilities;
   that APFs are available to support the requirement; and that the commander certifies that contracting
   for commercial fitness service is in the best interest of the Government.
9.4. Annual Review. Each MAJCOM/A1S conducts an annual review of physical fitness contracts.
The review includes a description of past and future usage of the facilities and a justification for
continuing with the arrangement. Forward Operating Agencies, Direct Reporting Units and any other
organization that does not report to a MAJCOM will report and be reviewed directly by HQ
AFSVA/SVP.

                                                Chapter 10

                                    MISCELLANEOUS GUIDANCE

10.1. Classifying Purchases from the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF). Classify services
purchased from DWCF as direct or indirect support based on the type of service provided.
     10.1.1. Classify common services as indirect support. Do not report these services.
10.2. USAF Museum Programs. Do not classify Air Force museums as Air Force Services activities.
     10.2.1. Comply with AFI 65-601, Volume I, when using APFs to support museum programs.
10.3. Recreation Information, Tickets and Tours (ITT) Services. ITT Services (NAF Cost Centers,
Ticket and Tour Operations) are Category B activities that provide the Air Force community information
and access to a diverse range of leisure activities available on and off the installation. It complements,
but does not include commercial services available through the unofficial commercial travel office.
Typical services include: information brochures and advice concerning local and regional sites or
attractions and local or regional group tours; tickets to local movie theaters, concerts, plays, sports
events and museums; admission to regional or national theme parks; and central registration and
advance sales for most Air Force Services facilities, services and programs on the installation.
10.4. Providing Unofficial Commercial Travel. Unofficial Commercial Travel Services is a Category
C activity that provides economical commercial leisure travel services for all members of the Air Force
community. These services are either contracted or provided in-house. Services operated directly or
indirectly may only be provided from either transportation management offices (TMO), or from Air
Force Services facilities dedicated exclusively to leisure travel products and services, e.g., air, rail and
bus tickets, packaged tours, group tours, cruises and travel insurance. Also, they may include remote or
automated services to satisfy requirements of installations that lack sufficient volume to justify a
manned office.
10.5. Private Animal Care.
     10.5.1. Classify private animal care (usually collocated with the veterinary clinic) as Category C Air
     Force Services activities.
     10.5.2. The Base Civil Engineer assigns a non-Air Force Services facility code since the veterinary
     clinic is not part of the Air Force Services program.
     10.5.3. Report veterinary clinic costs applicable to private animal care as Air Force Services
     support.
     10.5.4. Use APFs for veterinary clinic costs not related to private animal care such as janitorial ser-
     vices (not related to private animal care) and medical supplies used to treat government animals. Do
     not report these costs as support to Air Force Services.
     10.5.5. Do not use APFs for veterinary clinic costs related to private animal care such as clerical and
     small animal care assistants, medical supplies and equipment, and janitorial costs. Exception: APFs
     may be used for utilities.
10.6. Auditorium/Theater Multipurpose Community Facilities.
     10.6.1. Classify Services auditorium and theater multipurpose facilities as Category B activities,
     unless regular usage justifies another MWR category (see Table 2.1).
AFI65-106 6 May 2009                                                                                    43


       10.6.1.1. When AAFES uses these facilities to generate revenues either part time or full time,
       NAFs should be used to pay for utilities unless the wing commander determines APFs are
       available. If NAFs are used, the bill must be prorated so AAFES pays the MWR utility rate and
       only for the time used solely to generate revenue.
10.7. Private Organizations. See AFI 34-223, Private Organization (PO) Program, for policy on
establishing private organizations to operate on Air Force installations.
   10.7.1. Commanders must not provide APF support unless specifically authorized by separate
   instruction. Private organizations are not NAFIs or instrumentalities of the government.
10.8. Private Property. Commanders shall not authorize APFs for support of private property (such as
boats, aircraft, recreation vehicles, or horses).
   10.8.1. Personnel receiving support for private property such as boat or RV storage and grazing of
   animals must reimburse the Air Force for costs of services provided, including use of real property.
10.9. Official Functions Held in Category C Facilities. Organizations use APF contracts or NAFI
Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs) to obtain services from Category C activities for official
functions. Use of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs), NAFI MOAs, or Government Purchase Card is
recommended.
   10.9.1. Bases must justify sole source contracts for services provided by Category C activities.
   10.9.2. If designated remote and isolated locations are receiving the authorized level of appropriated
   support for Category C activities, they may not be reimbursed with APFs for official functions.
   10.9.3. Overseas Category C activities other than at designated remote and isolated locations may
   charge for official functions for NAF expenses.
   10.9.4. Air Force Services managers develop standard fees for each room under various circum-
   stances so that personnel can quote fees when booking an official function. APF support will not be
   used in the calculation.
   10.9.5. For official functions authorized to use APFs, Air Force Services managers limit service
   charges to NAF costs for setup/cleanup (hourly salary, including benefits, multiplied by time used);
   utilities (prorated based on square footage used); and cleaning of linens if NAFs are used.
       10.9.5.1. If NAFs are normally used to pay utilities, the amount charged APFs for utilities when
       Category C facilities are used for official functions must not exceed what the facility pays for the
       utilities used. Follow this example: the utility component of the standard fee for an official
       function held in a 1,000 square foot meeting room in a club with 10,000 square feet total, where
       the monthly utility charge is $10,000, would be computed as follows: Divide $10,000 by the total
       hours of operation in a month (in this example the club is open 320 hours monthly), then
       multiply by the percentage of club space occupied by the official function (1,000 square feet /
       10,000 square feet). In this case the hourly rate would be $3.13 ($10,000 / 320 X 10%). Multiply
       the hourly rate by the number of hours the function was held plus actual time for set up, tear
       down and clean up.
   10.9.6. Air Force Services managers don't include fixed costs, that is, facility depreciation, equip-
   ment, NAF accounting costs, overhead, and so on, in service charges reimbursed with APFs since
   these costs are fixed and should not vary because of hosting an official function.
   10.9.7. Do not use APFs to pay the costs of hosting vendor demonstrations of products such as com-
   puters and software since the vendor should incur these costs.
44                                                                              AFI65-106 6 May 2009


10.10. Communications and Cable Television Support for Services. Communications support,
including equipment, installation, commercial internet provider, maintenance and repair, and service
charges will be provided as follows:.
     10.10.1. Air Force Services Activities (Except Lodging and Category C activities). Authorize full

     validated and approved by the local communications board.
     10.10.2. Lodging Activities. Authorize full communication support for lodging administrative func-
     tions; maintenance and repair of existing government owned systems; monthly service charges and
     line rentals except for contracted systems; toll calls for administration; DSN and internet access;
     cable TV service to individual rooms to include one premium channel; and high-speed Internet
     connections for business suites because they are considered alternate work sites.
        10.10.2.1. Use NAFs to pay for new or replacement systems, toll calls by lodging guests, and
        credit card verification telephone lines.
     10.10.3. Air Force Services Category C Activities under Community Services and Sustainment
     Flights. Authorize APFs to pay for one line per facility with DSN access for ECCS as validated and
     approved by the installation commander. You may authorize additional lines or connections to the
     base network backbone or squadron local area networks for ECCS purposes. For multiple unique
     activities located in one facility, one line is authorized per general manager. These Category C
     activities include AAFES and Remote and Isolated locations.
        10.10.3.1. Authorize use of multiple extension lines as necessary. Don't use APFs for the cost of
        equipment, installation and maintenance and repair of multiple extension lines.
        10.10.3.2. The installation commander may authorize additional phone lines when commanders
        use these activities to conduct official meetings or to serve as mission readiness facilities, for

     communications support for ECCS, Air Force Services readiness and training, marketing and public-
     ity support for Categories A and B activities and Air Force Services-wide programs/events.
        10.10.5.1. Use NAFs to pay for day to day personnel administration of NAF employees and
        marketing and publicity support for Category C activities.
     10.10.6. Variances Caused by Physical Layout of Facilities. The actual number of lines may vary
     depending on the physical layout of the facilities at each base for the Resource Management,
     Sustainment, and Airman and Family Services Flights. However, non-reimbursable communication
     lines (APF) must be proportionate to the functions authorized APF support.
     10.10.7. Reimbursable Communication Support. The communications squadron may provide
     telephone services not authorized APF support on a reimbursable basis.
        10.10.7.1. Classify telephone services not authorized APFs as Class B-2, unofficial telephone
        service. Use NAFs to reimburse in accordance with AFI 33-111, Voice Systems Management.
AFI65-106 6 May 2009                                                                                   45


       10.10.7.2. Reimbursable rates for overseas locations are published annually by the DoD
       Comptroller’s office and disseminated by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS).
10.11. Purchasing Air Force Services Peculiar Items. All Air Force Services peculiar items, such as
athletic shoes, clothing, supplies, and equipment, can be purchased by individual organizations.
Organizational purchases require prior approval from the FSS and Mission Support Group Commander.
Organizational intramural sports uniforms may not be personalized with individual names and should be
returned to the unit following the season or when the member departs.
10.12. Intramural Bowling and Golf. Authorize APFs for trophies and administrative expenses
associated with intramural bowling and golf at the same level as other intramural sports. Do not use
APFs to pay for equipment use or rental fees and bowling center or golf course fees and charges.
10.13. Evacuation Expenses in Contingency and Emergency Situations. When the installation com-
mander orders evacuation, APF funding is authorized for evacuation costs of NAF employees to include
Air Force Services and AAFES at the same level of funding for APF employees.
10.14. Personnel Security Clearance Investigations. APFs are authorized to fund the charge assessed
for performing investigative services for all DoD personnel to include all NAF personnel.
10.15. Utilities. APFs are authorized for paying utilities in all Air Force Services activities, including
golf course clubhouses and their immediate grounds and at all AAFES facilities. This does not include
driving ranges and putting greens. Additionally, support is not authorized for CONUS golf courses
themselves unless designated as an official Remote and Isolated location (see Table 3.1.). If NAFs are
used to pay for utilities, the activity will not be charged for overhead, maintenance and repair, and
capital investments (per AFI 32-1061).
