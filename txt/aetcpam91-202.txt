Section A--Responsibilities

1. Contractor. As employers, contractors are solely responsible for the safety and health of their
employees under Public Law 91-596, The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Further, the
prime contractor is responsible for safety compliance of any subcontractor and employees. Under the
terms of the contract, a contractor is responsible for complying with certain other Air Force codes,
instructions and regulations, and, when applicable, CEV 385-1-1, US Army Corps of Engineers Safety
and Health Requirements Manual.

2. Air Force. The Air Force is responsible for the safety and health of its employees and military
personnel under Public Law 91-596 and Section 29, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 1960,
Basic Program Elements for Federal Employee OSH Programs and Related Matters. Contractor
employees are not employees of the Air Force. However, the Air Force has a responsibility to protect its
facilities and equipment from mishap or intentional damage or loss.

3. Safety Office. The safety office is responsible for briefing the prime contractor on safety
requirements, known hazardous conditions, confined spaces, and (or) other information pertinent to the
contract. This is normally accomplished at the preperformance conference and may then be followed up
with visits to the work area. (See AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program.)

Section B--Jurisdiction

4. US Department of Labor (DOL) Inspections:

4.1. The DOL has the statutory authority to conduct inspections and investigations at any location where
contractor employees perform their work. This includes work performed under an Air Force contract on
or off the military installation. Such inspections are usually performed with no prior notice.

4.2. Citations issued to a contractor for noncompliance with Occupational Safety and Health Act
(OSHA) standards are a matter for resolution between the contractor and the DOL. If a contractor is
cited by OSHA for violations involving government-furnished equipment (GFE) or facilities, it is the
contractor's responsibility to reply to the citation. In this type of situation, however, the Air Force, as
owner of the equipment or facility, could become involved in abatement of the hazard. Because of the
many legal and regulatory matters involved, each case is considered separately and on its own merit.

5. Air Force Inspections. The Air Force reserves the right to enter and inspect, with or without prior
notice and with the contracting officer's concurrence, any and all facilities and (or) project locations at an
AETC or Air Force base. These inspections protect Air Force personnel and resources by ensuring
compliance with safety, health, fire prevention, environmental, and (or) security directives, codes, and
standards. Inspection findings are sent to the base contracting office for presentation to the contractor.

5.1. As an example, the safety office might cite the contractor for failing to protect Air Force personnel
from an open trench, but would not cite a contract employee for failing to wear personal protective
equipment. The latter type of violation would be between OSHA and the contractor because it did not
endanger Air Force personnel. Such inspections may be conducted by safety, fire prevention,
occupational health, environmental, and (or) security forces professionals to protect Air Force resources,
not to force compliance on contract employees. These visits should be nondisruptive. When it is
AETCPAM 91-202           19 November 1999                                                                 5

necessary to provide instruction or guidance to contractors about safeguarding Air Force resources, this
will be done through the contracting office.

5.2. There are, however, exceptions to the practice described above. If a safety, health, or fire prevention
professional observes what is believed to be a life-threatening, imminent-danger situation, he or she
should take immediate measures to prevent the catastrophic event from occurring. Similarly, security
forces will act immediately if they observe a criminal act or breach of Air Force security.

5.3. If a construction project is totally contained behind a secure construction fence and no Air Force
personnel, property, or equipment is involved (for example, a new building under construction), there
may be no reason to enter the site until the final acceptance inspection.

6. United States Codes (U.S.C.). A contractor's presence on an AETC base makes the contractor subject
to the U.S.C. Violations of the U.S.C. are dealt with through the Federal Magistrates Court.

7. Mishap Reporting:

7.1. If contractors or their employees are involved in an onbase mishap, they should immediately notify
the security forces control center and then the contract administration officer. The mishap scene should
not be disturbed until proper officials authorize movement of vehicles, equipment, or materials. If the
mishap involves serious personal injury or rapid emergency assistance is required, dial 911 on any
telephone. State the exact nature of the emergency and location.

7.2. Once the emergency call has been completed, immediately notify the contract administration officer
if possible. Other than making emergency notifications, do not leave the scene of the mishap. Remain to
care for the injured and to guide responding emergency vehicles.

7.3. Immediately report to the contracting officer or the contracting activity's safety office all available
facts relating to each instance of damage to government property.

7.4. Secure the mishap scene and wreckage and impound important maintenance and training records
until released by the safety office. Such release will be done through the contracting office.

7.5. If the government elects to conduct an investigation of the mishap, the contractor should cooperate
fully and assist government personnel until the investigation is completed.

7.6. A clause should be included in each applicable subcontract to require the subcontractor's
cooperation and assistance in mishap reporting and investigation.

8. Use of Traffic Control Devices or Barricades. Any barricades used in conjunction with a contract
should be lighted and furnished by the contractor unless otherwise provided for in the contract. Any time
a street or roadway is to be blocked, notification should be made to the contract administration officer so
proper coordination occurs and no unnecessary problems are created.

9. Flight-Line Access. All restricted and (or) controlled area requirements must be met before
contractors are granted flight-line access. Contractor personnel should not operate any type of vehicle on
the flight line without written approval of the airfield manager (or a representative designated by the
6                                                              AETCPAM 91-202           19 November 1999

airfield manager).

Section C--Base Administrative Procedures

10. Duty Hours. Normal duty hours for the majority of base personnel are approximately from 7:00 a.m.
(0700) to 5:00 p.m. (l700), Monday through Friday. If a contractor or his or her employees must work
weekends, holidays, or nonduty hours, the contractor should notify the contract administration officer,
who will, in turn, notify the security forces control center. Failure to provide advance notification could
result in unnecessary delays to obtain verification.

11. Operation Crime Stop. This is an Air Force-wide program conducted by the local security forces
squadron. The objective is to deter crime by encouraging persons to report any crime they witness
without having to identify themselves. If a contractor or his or her employees witness a crime, they
should call the law enforcement desk and provide as much information as possible. The caller does not
have to give his or her name. Support for this program is appreciated.

12. Job Site Security. Contractors are responsible for the security of their materials and equipment at a
job site. They should take time necessary at the end of the workday to secure this equipment and
materials. If theft or vandalism at the job site is discovered, the contractor should notify the contract
administration officer who will, in turn, notify the security forces control center. An investigation will be
conducted by the appropriate law enforcement agency, and every effort will be made to apprehend those
involved. Contractors with extremely high-value, theft-attractive equipment or materials can call the
resources protection office for information about reducing losses.

13. Base Entry Checks. Periodically, the security forces perform base and (or) specific entry point
checks. This involves a search of motor vehicles (which may include a search of personal belongings). A
search may occur at any time, and all persons entering the base are subject to such a search. Failure to
consent to a search results in base entry being denied and can result in being permanently barred from
the base.

14. Bringing Prohibited Items Onto Base:

14.1. Firearms, ammunition, and explosives may not be brought onto an Air Force base except when
required to complete a contract. (For radioisotopes or radiation-producing equipment, see paragraph 49.)

14.2. Prior approval is required when explosives and (or) ramset ammunition will be used during a
project.

14.3. Privately owned weapons of contractors and their employees are strictly prohibited. In states where
there is a concealed handgun law allowing persons with a permit to carry a concealed weapon, that law
does not apply to any federal property.

14.4. Illegal drug use or possession will not be tolerated. Contractor employees should be aware that
narcotic and explosive detector dogs may be used to check vehicles in parking lots and to check work
areas for the presence of illegal substances. Violators will be prosecuted. Alcoholic beverages are not
permitted for consumption in work areas or in public areas except for officially approved functions.
AETCPAM 91-202           19 November 1999                                                                7

Section D--Safety and Health Standards

15. Compliance. As with all US employees, contractors should comply with the safety and health
standards of the DOL and ensure their employees also comply. Depending on the nature of the contract,
a contractor may be required to meet Air Force occupational safety and health (AFOSH) standards when
involved in a joint operation with federal employees. (In most cases, AFOSH standards are more
stringent than OSHA standards.)

Section E--Safety Requirements and Responsibilities

16. Traffic and Pedestrians. The contractor should:

16.1. Ensure all open trenches, pits, manholes, and excavations are properly guarded or barricaded at all
times and illuminated during hours of darkness and (or) reduced visibility.

16.2. Provide proper and adequate trench or pit crossovers for traffic and pedestrians if traffic and
pedestrians cannot be rerouted.

16.3. Coordinate with base security forces, fire department, military treatment facility (for emergency
vehicle routing), and civil engineers prior to cutting any roadway or blocking or partially blocking base
vehicle traffic flow.

16.4. Publish any planned road closures in the base newspaper and bulletin at least 1 week in advance.

16.5. Ensure his or her equipment is properly guarded with road traffic cones and traffic control signs
any time the equipment is exposed to or stationary on or near an active roadway.

17. Trenching, Excavation, Open Pits, and (or) Manholes. The contractor should:

17.1. Apply the procedures in paragraph 16.

17.2. Ensure trenching, excavation, open pits, and (or) manholes are properly shored if their depth
exceeds 5 feet (29 CFR 1926.650, .651, and .652, Safety and Health Regulations for Construction).

17.3. Prior to any digging activity, obtain necessary digging permits from the base civil engineer.

17.4. Coordinate with the base operations branch prior to any work on or near airfield ramp and
associated taxiways.

17.5. Ensure any pit or manhole in excess of 5 feet deep is air sampled prior to personnel entry if the pit
or hole has been unoccupied for 2 hours or more.

17.6. Any time trenching and digging equipment is in operation, ensure an observer is present in addition
to the operator.

17.7. If suspected contaminated media is encountered while digging, halt the work, contact the base
environmental shop, and comply with the determination made by the base civil engineer as to what
8                                                              AETCPAM 91-202           19 November 1999

measures are required before work is resumed.

17.8. Ensure the use of an open flame in a manhole complies with safety criteria in 29 CFR 1910.21b,
.146, and .268, Occupational Safety and Health Standards for Industry, and 29 CFR 1926.956.

17.9. Ensure occupied manholes are guarded and have a safety observer on top and in close proximity to
the manhole openings according to 29 CFR 1910.23, 1910.268, and 1926.956.

17.10. Ensure a rescue line is available at occupied manholes.

18. Equipment and Material Storage. The contractor should:

18.1. Properly mark motorized equipment and chock vehicle tires at the end of the workday or when they
are left unattended.

18.2. Maintain motorized equipment in a safe operating condition per state law.

18.3. If a portable construction trailer or office is used, anchor it sufficiently to prevent wind and storm
damage.

18.4. Check cable reels with proper size dunnage when not in use.

18.5. Ensure cable reels are not left elevated while unattended.

18.6. Properly chock and brake cable trailers when they are not connected to a towing vehicle.

18.7. Ensure storage of government property is consistent with DoD 4145.19-R-1, Storage and
Materials Handling.

19. Hoist and Lifting Devices. The contractor should:

19.1. Maintain and operate hoists, cranes, slings, and other lifting equipment in a safe manner to prevent
damage to government property.

19.2. Ensure lifting devices and equipment are of sufficient capacity for the loads lifted.

19.3. Label lifting devices and equipment with their load capacities.

19.4. Ensure the operator visually inspects lifting devices and equipment before each use.

19.5. Identify lifting devices and equipment used for critical loads (high value items) with serial number
and load test them at 125 percent of their load capacity at least annually.

19.6. Ensure slings are not used when tied in knots or damaged.

20. Handling, Storing, and Using Flammable Liquids. The contractor should:
AETCPAM 91-202           19 November 1999                                                                9

20.1. Use approved safety cans for handling, transporting, and dispensing flammable liquids at the site.
Mark containers with the hazard and name of the material; for example, "Flammable - Gasoline." Keep
containers tightly covered when not in use to prevent evaporation of flammable vapors into the
atmosphere.

20.2. Take measures to exclude all possible sources of ignition from the vicinity of flammable liquids or
their vapors. Spark and flame-producing devices are prohibited.

20.3. Provide adequate ventilation, natural or supplied, in all areas where flammable liquids are used,
handled, or stored.

20.4. Properly store flammable liquids according to National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA)
criteria.

21. Handling, Storing, and Using Compressed Gas. The contractor should:

21.1. Handle, store, and transport compressed gas cylinders in the vicinity of Air Force property
according to DoD 4145.19-R-1, and AFR 67-12, Storage and Handling of Compressed Gases and Gas
Cylinders (projected to be AFJI 23-227).

21.2. Post adequate warning signs to indicate that all sources of ignition, such as smoking and carrying
matches, are prohibited within 50 feet of all possible explosive or flammable gas-air mixtures. Ensure
electrical equipment is explosion proof and sources of static electricity are bonded and grounded.
Ensures spark-producing devices are not used in areas where flammable gases exist.

21.3. On the valve body, stamp the name of the gas for which a valve is intended. Open cylinder valves
by hand unless the container is equipped with a wrench key.

21.4. Ensure gas cylinders are not stored where there is danger of mishap damage or in areas where the
cylinders will be subjected to corrosive chemicals or similar materials. Also ensure cylinders are not
stored near electrical conductors or other sources of electricity.

21.5. Ensure cylinders containing different gases are not stored together. Store nonflammable gases in
locations separate from flammable gases. Separation by a fire wall or other approved firebreaks are
required if the two types of gases are stored in close proximity to each other.

22. Welding, Cutting, or Brazing Activities. A welding and cutting permit should be obtained from the
base fire department prior to any cuttiing or welding. The contracting officer should be notified, in
writing, that a permit has been issued. The contractor should:

22.1. Ensure personnel performing duties as a welder, cutter, or brazer are fully qualified.

22.2. Prior to starting welding, cutting, or brazing activities outside approved shops, ensure the activity
supervisor obtains a welding permit from the fire department.

22.3. Implement fire watcher procedures when activities are conducted within 35 feet of combustible
materials, regardless of protection provided. Ensure a qualified individual, proficient in the operation of
10                                                            AETCPAM 91-202            19 November 1999

fire-extinguishing equipment, observes the activities for at least 30 minutes after the operation is
completed.

22.4. While welding or cutting operations are being performed, maintain fire-extinguishing equipment
ready for use.

22.5. Where available, ensure sprinkler protection is fully serviceable while welding or cutting work is
being performed.

22.6. For equipment gas leaks, use soapy water (not flame) to check for gas leakage before lighting the
torch. Mark a leaky cylinder with a warning sign that cautions personnel not to approach it with any
ignition source.

23. General Requirements. The contractor should:

23.1. Maintain housekeeping to keep the environment in a clean, orderly condition. Provide suitable
metal containers with self-closing lids at all industrial activities for the disposal of combustible wastes,
rags, and other flammable materials. Mark containers as hazardous or nonhazardous waste. Also mark
them with the contents of the container, the name of the person and office generating the waste, and the
accumulation start date. NOTE: These hazmat contractor requirements should be outlined in the
performance work statement. Refer to the performance work statement to resolve any conflict.

23.2. Ensure vehicle and (or) equipment operators are properly trained, certified, and (or) licensed for
operation. The contractor is responsible for training and certification.

23.3. Ensure vehicle operators and passengers use safety belts while operating and (or) riding in a
vehicle (business or privately owned) on base.

23.4. Ensure employees refrain from consuming alcohol and (or) drugs while on base.

23.7. If explosives are used on a construction project, provide adequate storage facilities conforming to
applicable safety distances as specified in AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards. Do not allow
storage or use of explosives without prior consent of the safety office (explosives safety officer). This
requirement does not pertain to a reasonable small amount of ammunition for use in powder-activated
tools (less than 1,000 rounds). Operators of powder-activated tools should be trained and certified in
their use. All powder-activated cartridges will be strictly accounted for, and all spent cartridges and duds
will be removed from the job site at the end of the day. NOTE: Any modifications or changes that alter
form, fit, or function of a system or subsystem require a system safety engineering analysis. MIL-STD-
882B, System Safety Program Requirements, applies.

24. Lockout or Tagout (Control of Hazardous Energy). The contractor should establish a program of
AETCPAM 91-202           19 November 1999                                                              11

energy control procedures and employee training. Training should be completed before employees
perform service or maintenance on a machine or equipment where the unexpected energizing, startup, or
release of stored energy could occur and cause injury or property damage. The machine or equipment
should be isolated and rendered inoperative in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.147.

25. Confined Space Entry (Joint Operations):

25.1. The owning organization's safety specialist may use the sample at Attachment 2 (Permit for a
Confined Space Entry) to accomplish the contractor's briefing. The contractor should notify the owning
organization's safety specialist at least 1 week prior to entry into the confined space for accomplishment
of the required briefing.

25.2. Personnel who work within confined spaces that, by design, have limited openings for entry and
exit, have unfavorable natural ventilation, are not intended primarily for human occupancy, or contain
other recognized safety hazards should comply with 29 CFR 1910.146 and AFOSH Std 91-25, Confined
Spaces. An AF Form 1024, Confined Space Entry Permit, or equivalent, should be processed with the
local safety, health, and fire department offices before personnel enter the confined space. Local safety,
health, and (or) fire department personnel should brief the contractor as follows:

25.2.1. The workplace contains a permit-required confined space, and entry will be authorized according
to an approved confined-space program.

25.2.2. The contents of a space or hazards of a space determine if a permit is required.

25.2.3. Precautions and procedures have been implemented by the organization to protect workers.

25.2.4. Entry operations and procedures have been coordinated with the contractor, and the permit space
entry system to be used when both organizational and contractor personnel are working in a permit-
required confined space has been agreed on.

25.2.5. The contractor is responsible for the safety of contractor personnel and should use the contractor
entry program and procedures if working independently in a permit-required space.

25.3. Local safety personnel may debrief the contractor at the end of the entry operations to develop
lessons learned from any problems or hazards encountered or created during the entry operations.

Section F--Fire Prevention

26. Applicability of AFI 32-2001. While working on base, contractors are subject to AFI 32-2001, The
Fire Protection Operations and Fire Prevention Program, and its MAJCOM and base supplements.
Contractors should brief their employees and any subcontractors on the requirements of this directive to
ensure a uniformly high level of fire prevention.

27. Reporting Fires. The contractor should:

27.1. Report all fires to the fire department, no matter how small. This includes fires that were burning
themselves out prior to discovery and those extinguished by the person discovering the fire. Report fires
12                                                             AETCPAM 91-202            19 November 1999

immediately by calling on any base administrative telephone, using a manual fire station or pull box, or
reporting the fire in person at the fire station.

27.2. When giving an alarm over the phone, speak slowly and distinctly and give the exact location of
the fire by building number or type facility, street intersections, and type and size of the fire if possible.
Remain at a designated location to direct responding fire department personnel to the actual scene of the
fire. (If possible, other contractor employees should use fire extinguishers to control the fire.)

27.3. Brief his or her employees that persons turning in false alarms or tampering with fire reporting
devices are subject to disciplinary action.

28. General Rules. The contractor should:

28.1. Furnish his or her own portable fire protection. Train personnel engaged in operations involving
specific hazards or likely to be required to use portable extinguishers in the operation of the
extinguishers assigned to their work area. NOTE: Contractor supervisors should ensure all personnel
assigned to their area of responsibility are familiar with the location, operation, and types of available
fire extinguishing, alarm systems, and detection equipment.

28.2. Not paint fire detectors, sprinklers, or fire protection equipment.

28.3. Not use fire hydrants without prior approval of the fire chief. If permission is granted for use of a
fire hydrant, the contractor should furnish a gate valve to fit the 2 1/2-inch outlet and a proper hydrant
wrench. Each time a hydrant is to be opened or closed, the fire department should be notified because, in
some areas of the base, false alarms occur from water surges. NOTE: Fire hose, nozzles, or hydrant
wrenches will not be loaned by the fire department.

28.4. Not park or store vehicles or equipment within 15 feet of a fire hydrant.

28.5. When working in attics, take precautions to not damage or step on fire-detection wiring. Extreme
care should be taken when working around or near any fire protection or detection alarm systems.
Accidental contact with components of these systems or the production of steam, smoke, or vapors from
some processes could cause damage to the system or initiate an emergency response by the fire
department. Any time a fire protection or detection alarm system hampers accomplishment of contract
work, fire alarm systems maintenance assistance should be requested.

28.6. Ensure the contractor monitor or designated representative notifies the fire department and
contracting officer of any utility shutdown that might affect an installed fire protection or detection
system.

28.7. Ensure the accumulation of all debris inside a building is kept to a minimum. Do not store any
combustible materials under stairs. Remove wood and waste materials at the end of the workday. Do not
place piles of debris awaiting removal outside any facility in fire lanes or within 25 feet of the facility.

28.8. Ensure temporary heat is provided by portable electric heaters approved by Underwriters
Laboratory (UL). Heaters should be kept away from combustible or flammable materials.
AETCPAM 91-202           19 November 1999                                                             13

28.9. Ensure extension cords used are of sufficient gauge to operate electrical devices, heaters, and
lighting without overheating the cord or plug. Ensure unnecessary electrical appliances are unplugged at
the end of the workday.

28.10. Ensure only explosion-proof electrical fixtures and appliances are used in areas where flammable
vapors are present.

29. Smoking:

29.1. Smoking is prohibited within 50 feet of the following:

29.1.1. Gasoline dispensing points.

29.1.2. Flammable liquid storage area.

29.1.3. Paint storage areas.

29.1.4. Compressed gas storage areas.

29.1.5. Possible explosive or flammable gas air mixtures.

29.1.6. Any other designated area.

29.2. Smoking is prohibited in any Air Force building or vehicle.

29.3. Smoking is prohibited in aircraft maintenance facilities, flight-line areas, weapons storage, and
maintenance areas (EXCEPTION: Where designated by the base fire chief in coordination with the
functional manager and [or] supervisor).

30. Hazards of Construction and Service Operations:

30.1. Salamanders. Because ignition of combustible materials by heating salamanders is commonplace,
use of salamanders should be regulated and supervised. They should be kept away from combustible
materials. Salamanders that have not been tested and are not listed by a nationally recognized laboratory
should not be used.

30.2. Temporary Wiring. All wiring should be installed and supervised by competent electricians.
Temporary circuits, especially high-voltage ones, require substantial protection against physical damage
from movable equipment, etc.

30.3. Flammable Liquids. Careless storage and handling of flammable and combustible liquids are
responsible for many construction and service fires. Small quantities of gasoline used for motorized
construction equipment should be handled in a safety container and stored in an isolated location.
Flammable and combustible liquids should be removed from the building at the end of the workday and
stored in an approved location. Flammable liquids should be stored only in suitable metal containers.
Gasoline or any other low flash point flammable liquids should not be used for cleaning purposes or to
start fires.
14                                                            AETCPAM 91-202           19 November 1999

30.4. Roofing Mops. Roofing mops soaked in pitch or asphalt should never be left inside a building near
heating equipment or combustible materials. These mops are subject to spontaneous heating or ignition,
regardless of what they are made of.

30.5. Gasoline-Powered Equipment. Gasoline-powered equipment, such as air compressors, hoists,
and pumps, should be located so exhausts are well away from combustible material. Gasoline engines
should be shut off during refueling operations. Static bonding wires should be properly attached before
combustible or flammable liquid is transferred from one vessel to another.

30.6. Compressed Air Operations. Where construction or service operations are conducted under
increased air pressure (as in tunnels), combustion is greatly accelerated so particular precautions are
necessary to prevent the ignition of combustible materials.

30.7. Tar Kettles. After fire department approval has been obtained, the pots or kettles (when operated)
should be under constant supervision by a qualified operator. The pots or kettles should be positioned at
least 25 feet from the building being worked on. Adequate fire extinguishers should be placed within 25
feet and accessible to each pot or kettle.

30.8. Open Burning. Open burning of fires is strictly prohibited except with prior approval of the fire
department and prior notification of the contracting officer.

30.9. Paints. Paint brushes, empty paint cans, varnishes, rags, paint clothes, drop cloths, etc., should be
removed from the building at the end of the workday and stored in an approved location.

31. Additional Published Guidance. In addition to the guidance in this pamphlet, official DoD
publications and nationally recognized standards apply. Hazardous conditions of a particular nature for
which no criteria has been developed or published should be corrected by local action based on sound
judgment.

32. Practicing Fire Prevention. Contractors should encourage their employees to practice fire
prevention at all times. If there are any questions, call the technical services section of the fire
department.

Section G--Environmental Material

33. Handling and Use of Chemicals--Short-Term Contracts (Less Than 1 Year):

33.1. The standard deliverable for all contacts where the vendor or solicitor indicates a hazardous
material (hazmat) will be used or delivered on or to the base should include a listing of all the hazmat to
be used along with a copy of the material safety data sheet for each and an AF Form 3952, Chemical
Hazardous Material Request/Authorization, or equivalent describing and intended process. The
material safety data sheet should be provided to the base hazardous material management office
(HAZMO) prior to starting work. Copies of material safety data sheets should be maintained at each
work site where a chemical is used. Employees should be trained in hazardous communication
(HAZCOM) to the level required by OSHA. The contractor should provide copies of training

AETCPAM 91-202           19 November 1999                                                                15

33.2. The standard deliverable at final signoff should include a listing of total quantities delivered or
used. If final signoff spans calendar years, a year-end report is also required. The listing should include
the noun and part number or trade name; manufacturer's name, city, and state; total quantity delivered,
consumed, unused (removed off site), and disposed of as waste; and the method of disposal.

34. Handling and Use of Chemicals--Long-Term Contracts (Greater Than 1 Year):

34.1. The standard deliverable for all contracts where the vendor or solicitor indicates hazmat will be
used or delivered on or to the base should be in accordance with AFI 32-7086/AETC Sup 1, Hazardous
Materials Management, and any local supplements. Each AF Form 3952 will be accompanied by a
material safety data sheet. The next step on the contract should not be allowed until the AF Form 3952 is
signed off by the HAZMO. Copies of material safety data sheets will be maintained at each work site
where a chemical is used. Employees will be trained in HAZCOM to the level required by OSHA. The
contractor will provide copies of training documentation and (or) licenses on request.

34.2. The standard deliverable each quarter (1 April, 1 July, 1 October, and 1 January) should include a
listing or report with the following information: noun and part number or trade name; manufacturer's
name, city, and state; and total quantity delivered, consumed, unused (removed off site), and disposed of
as waste; and the method of disposal (AFI 32-7086).

34.3. Contracts using Air Force supply systems to acquire hazmat will be exempt from the reporting
requirement in paragraph 33.2 because tracking will occur through the Hazmat Pharmacy Program
(HPP) in place at the Air Force supply system.

35. Use, Storage, and Disposal of Hazmat. The base environmental office (CEV) reserves the right to
limit or disapprove the use, storage, and disposal of hazmat.

36. Using or Removing Hazmat. Hazmat brought on site by a contractor will be consumed or taken off
site before contract completion. Exceptions to this requirement will be specifically stated in the contract.

37. Waste Accumulation and Disposal. Procedures for waste accumulation and disposal will be

base organizations.

42. Protecting Personal Equipment, Labeling Containers, and Performing Training Essential To
Safely Using Chemical Substances. As required by 29 CFR 1910.1200, and other directives, the
contractor will ensure these tasks are accomplished. If chemical usage will have harmful impact in areas
16                                                           AETCPAM 91-202           19 November 1999

where base personnel are working or living, the base bioenvironmental engineer will be notified prior to
the start of work.

43. Ventilation. Adequate ventilation must be provided when chemicals or processes that generate
fumes or combustion byproducts are used. This includes welding, the use of gas or diesel powered
equipment, and painting.

44. Manufacturer's Instructions. Chemicals must not be used in a manner that will adversely affect the
health of personnel working in the surrounding area. Use chemicals as directed by the manufacturer.
Before proceeding, coordinate any deviation with the base bioenvironmental engineer and the
contracting officer.

45. Storage and Disposal of Chemicals:

45.1. Unless otherwise stated in the contract, disposal of hazardous wastes generated during the contract
is the responsibility of the contractor. Contractors are prohibited from disposing of any waste water,
chemical waste, and unused chemicals into the storm water collection system. Unless prior approval has
been obtained, contractors are also prohibited from disposing of any waste water, chemical waste, and
unused chemicals into the sanitary and industrial waste water collection systems. This disposal will be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis. However, materials that are always prohibited include fuels, oils,
hydraulic and transmission fluid, paints, and chlorinated solvents. For further information, refer to the
HQ AETC Hazardous Material Pharmacy Guide available from the local hazmat pharmacy.

45.2. Storage and removal of hazardous wastes, contaminated chemicals, or used petroleum products
must be cleared through the base CEV. Handling, transportation, storage, and disposal of wastes are
closely monitored by several regulatory agencies. Waste containers must be in good condition and
marked with the contents, responsible party's name and phone number, and accumulation start date.
Hazardous and nonhazardous wastes being shipped off base must be accompanied by a hazardous
manifest. Guidance concerning disposal of waste may be obtained from CEV.

46. Emergency Response to Chemical Spills:

46.1. A release of any amount of petroleum products, oils, lubricants, or chemicals containing material
substances (other than pure water) will be reported immediately to the fire department and the
contracting officer for prompt notification and, if necessary, a consolidated emergency spill response.
The contractor will be liable for any government cleanup and disposal costs incurred as a result of such
events. Further guidance can be found in each base's spill prevention and response plan.

46.2. Preventive measures should be exercised to minimize the chances for spilling chemicals. These
include, but are not limited to, the use of material-handling devices such as dollies, drip pans, and hand
trucks; careful and thorough inspection of refueling tanks and drums for leaks, cracks, and loose
connections; allowing 10-percent ullage in containers; properly recapping or resealing containers when
finished; ensuring containers are properly labeled; and using materials only for their intended purpose.

47. Asbestos:

47.1. All AETC bases have completed a comprehensive survey and documented presence or lack of
AETCPAM 91-202           19 November 1999                                                                 17

asbestos. Lists are available through the base civil engineer. However, if suspected asbestos-containing
material (ACM) is encountered during a project, the contractor will notify the CEV immediately through
the contract monitor. The CEV will notify the base civil engineer and bioenvironmental engineering
when bulk and (or) air sampling is required. The bioenvironmental engineer will determine the percent
of asbestos content and friability.

47.2. ACM should not be disturbed except by individuals specifically trained and licensed in asbestos
abatement activities. That is, do not disturb or damage ACM unless asbestos removal is an explicit part
of the contract.

48. Lead-Based Paint. The Air Force requires the requesting unit to ensure qualitative testing of paint is
accomplished prior to allowing contractor work to begin (except if the contract is for lead-based paint
removal). If lead-based paint is suspected, contact bioenvironmental engineering for testing; do not
disturb facilities until all conditions are known and controlled.

49. Other Materials on Base:

49.1. Radiation:

49.1.1. Radioisotopes or radiation-producing equipment will not be brought or used on the base by
contractor or subcontractor without written approval of the base radiation safety officer or the
bioenvironmental engineer. Contractors must comply with AFI 40-201, Managing Radioactive
Materials in the USAF, and give the radiation safety officer at least 30 days notice before bringing
radioactive material on the base. The notice will include the source (type and activity of radioactive
material), a copy of a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) or equivalent license, training
documentation for all users, and written procedures on radiation use, storage, and emergencies while on
base.

49.1.2. If a contractor intends to use radioactive material at the installation on an irregular schedule, he
or she will provide written notice at the beginning of the project in addition to a verbal notice to the base
radiation safety officer each day the work will involve the use of radioactive materials. The contracting
officer will receive copies of all approved or disapproved requests.

49.1.3. Contractors holding radioactive materials license from the Department of Public Health must
also have an approved NRC Form 241, Report of Proposed Activities in Non-Agreement States. This
form and information regarding the use of radioactive material can be obtained from the base radiation
safety officer.

49.2. Chemical Substances. There are thousands of chemical substances and many pieces of machinery
on an Air Force base. Care should be exercised when working in and around the equipment and
chemicals used and stored thereon. When there is concern about a chemical substance or piece of
equipment in the area involved in the contract, the contractor should be informed about any known
hazards.
