SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change incorporates new guidelines which address changes to centrifuge training,
changing the number of profiles for Initial Acceleration Training from five to four and mandates
successful completion of all profiles. It eliminates F-15E and A-10 aircrew refresher centrifuge
requirements and A-10 qualification requirements for FTU entry. In addition, Chapter 3, which
establishes requirements for centrifuge training for pilots enrolled in T-6 and T-38 PIT courses,
is deleted. A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised material.

                                            Chapter 1

                                        INTRODUCTION

1.1. Purpose and Need for Centrifuge Training. The high-G aircraft operated by today’s
aircrew are easily capable of causing G-induced loss of consciousness (GLOC). Optimum
physical conditioning, appropriate functioning of anti-G equipment, and adequate G-oriented
situational awareness are all important to aircrew G-tolerance; however, an effective anti-G
straining maneuver (AGSM) is the aircrew’s most significant weapon against the potentially
incapacitating effects of G, adding an average of 3.5 G to aircrew resting G-tolerance.
Centrifuge training has proven to be our best device for teaching the proper AGSM, as well as
providing the opportunity for teaching the physiology of high-G flight and an awareness of the
factors that affect an aircrew’s G-tolerance from day to day.
     1.1.1. Centrifuge training consists of initial acceleration training between the primary (T-
     6/T-37/T34) and advanced (T-38) phases in Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training
     (SUPT) and Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot training (ENJJPT). Qualification training takes place
     before introduction to fighter fundamentals (IFF) and is required for Sustained High G
     Aircraft (SHGA) aircrew that did not previously complete this training. In addition, refresher
     centrifuge training is required for all former SHGA aircrew who are either returning from 3-
     plus years non-flying or who are converting from a non-SHGA to a SHGA or higher-G
     SHGA. Commander-directed training is also available to address specific technique
     problems.
     1.1.2. There is a 12-hour, automatic duty-not-including-flying (DNIF) period following any
     centrifuge training for individuals flying as primary aircraft crewmembers due to fatigue and
     residual motion sickness.
     1.1.3. The purpose of centrifuge training is to enhance combat capability and safety by
     optimizing aircrew defense against GLOC through the following methods:
        1.1.3.1. Increase aircrew awareness of the potentially incapacitating effects of GLOC.
        1.1.3.2. Train and evaluate aircrew on a properly performed AGSM in a controlled
        environment.
        1.1.3.3. Address strategies to improve aircrew performance under G-stress through the
        proper fit and use of protective equipment, the importance of maintaining fitness for the
        G-environment, proper nutrition, rest, hydration, and situational awareness.
        1.1.3.4. Identify aircrew with low G-tolerance and poor AGSM skill performance.
1.2. Formal Training Prerequisite. Attendance of the appropriate centrifuge training program
is a prerequisite for entry into all post-SUPT high-G aircraft formal training unit (FTU) courses.
Foreign aircrews returning to their home country following formal training are exempt from this
requirement. Centrifuge training is listed as ACC course number 30-30-30.
1.3. Explanation of Terms and Abbreviations:
     1.3.1. G-Awareness Training. A comprehensive program ensures optimum G-awareness
     training of HGA aircrew. It consists of physiological and operational training on G-

  awareness, centrifuge training, and an ongoing continuation training program. This
  instruction addresses only the centrifuge training program. For information regarding the
  physiological aspects of high-G operations, see AFPAM 11-419. For information regarding
  continuation training requirements, see AFI 11-2F-16V1, AFI 11-2F-15V1, AFI 11-2F-
  15EV1, AFI 11-2A/OA-10V1, and AFI 11-2T/AT-38V1, AFI 11-2T-6V1, AFI 11-2F-
  117V1, AFI 11-F/A-22V1and AFI 11-2T-37 V1.
  1.3.2. Active Sustained High G Aircraft (SHGA) aircrew. Any pilot, weapons system
  officer, flight surgeon, aerospace physiologist, student pilot or navigator in the fighter
  pipeline, or other rated aircrew/operational support flyer assigned to an active flying billet or
  performing unrestricted flight in a SHGA. The provisions of this instruction apply to all
  active SHGA aircrew and operational support flyers participating in unrestricted SHGA
  flights. Flight test engineers, combat camera, and aerial photographers are not required to
  take centrifuge training.
  1.3.3. Anti-G Straining Maneuver (AGSM). The AGSM is performed by:
     1.3.3.1. Isometric muscle tensing with particular emphasis on the legs, buttocks and
     abdominal muscles sustained throughout exposure to G forces.
     1.3.3.2. Maintenance of adequate intrathoracic pressure by holding a preparatory breath,
     against a closed glottis for 3-second cycles, followed by rapid air exchanges. Repeat
     until return to baseline G.
     1.3.3.3. Timing the application of the AGSM to begin just prior to G-onset and basing
     the intensity of the AGSM on the achieved G-level.
  1.3.4. Authorized Centrifuge Training Facilities.
     1.3.4.1. Facilities for USAF SHGA aircrew are:
         1.3.4.1.1. Physiological Training Center, Holloman AFB, NM.
         1.3.4.1.2. Brooks City-Base, Texas is an authorized centrifuge training facility for
         USAFSAM formal course students, including trainees in the Aerospace Medicine
         Primary (AMP/flight surgeon) Course, the Aerospace Physiology Officer Course and
         the Aerospace Physiology technician courses, as well as AETC Pilot Instructor
         Training (PIT) students.
         1.3.4.1.3. Naval Air Station Lemoore, CA is an authorized training facility for USAF
         SHGA aircrew, provided that training is conducted by an authorized Holloman AFB-
         qualified Aerospace Physiologist. Centrifuge profiles must be in compliance with
         this instruction.

     status may obtain centrifuge training from the following countries: Netherlands,
     Germany, Singapore, Taiwan, and Turkey, provided the training received has met USAF
     standards as identified in this instruction. Verification of successful completion of
     training and profiles completed will need to be provided to local Aerospace Physiology
     resources for approval and documentation on AF Form 702, Individual Physiological
     Training Record.
6                                                                AFI11-404 28 OCTOBER 2005


           1.3.4.2.1. Initial/qualification training conducted at any other location will be verified
           by a Holloman AFB aerospace physiologist on a case-by-case basis.
           1.3.4.2.2. Other US military service aircrew flying USAF trainer or fighter aircraft on
           exchange status must complete the required USAF centrifuge training as outlined in
           this instruction.
    1.3.5. High-G Aircraft (HGA). Aircraft capable of generating a G-loading in excess of
    4.0G. This definition is further divided into the following two categories:
       1.3.5.1. Sustained High-G Aircraft (SHGA). Capable of rapid G-onset rates (greater
       than 3.0G/sec) and sustained (greater than 5 seconds) G-loading of greater than 6.0 G.
       Current aircraft which meet this definition are the A/O/A-10, T/AT-38, AV-8, F-4F, F-5,
       F-14, F-15, F-16, F/A-18, and F/A-22.
           1.3.5.1.1. Aircrew that use the T-38 aircraft for landing currency only do not require
           centrifuge training. ACC T-38 IPs are required to check out other pilots on their
           AGSM and are required appropriate centrifuge training. Pilots current and qualified
           in the centrifuge do not require additional training at the local base.
           1.3.5.1.2. Aircrews that use the T-38 for the Companion Trainer Program do not
           require centrifuge training as long as maneuvering is limited to less than 6.0G. These
           aircrew are required to attend AGSM academic training conducted by a qualified
           aerospace physiologist and must be evaluated in the aircraft by a qualified T-38
           instructor pilot on AGSM performance. Aircrew identified as needing additional
           training will be required to complete commander-directed training under the
           provisions of Chapter 6.
       1.3.5.2. Non-Sustained High-G Aircraft (non-SHGA). All other HGA that do not meet
       the SHGA definition.
    1.3.6. Profiles. A profile is one run on the centrifuge training device from start (idle) to stop
    (return to idle or stop). Gradual onset rate is 1/10th G per second, moderate onset rate is 1-3
    Gs per second, and rapid onset rate is 6 Gs per second.
    1.3.7. Forms used in centrifuge training.
       1.3.7.1. AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training Record. This form tracks all
       physiological and centrifuge training and is maintained in the aircrew’s flight records.
       1.3.7.2. AF Form 4293, Student Activity Record. This forms lists the centrifuge profiles
       completed, the evaluation of student performance, and recommended AGSM and G-
       awareness improvements. This form is the official debrief to the student of their
       performance during centrifuge training and, in order to maintain the integrity of this
       process, cannot be reproduced without the student being present. Students having
       completed centrifuge training must ensure the AF Form 4293 goes into their flying
       training grade book upon return from centrifuge training.
    1.3.8. Experienced Rated Officer. For the purposes of this instruction only, an experienced
    rated officer is defined as a rated officer who:
       1.3.8.1. Has logged greater than 1,000 hours in SHGA.

     1.5.2. ―1‖ – Marginal. AGSM performance needs continued assistance to correct technical
     errors. The trainee is expected to develop AGSM skill and proficiency with continued
     practice at centrifuge training facility. Trainee will remain no longer than 3 working days
     past initial training date to complete passing criteria.
     1.5.3. ―2‖ – Average. Passed; AGSM performance has not been mastered fully. Trainee
     makes minor AGSM performance errors that impact AGSM technique but recognizes and
     corrects them.
     1.5.4. ―3‖ – Excellent. Passed; AGSM performance is correct, efficient, and skillful.
     Trainee makes only minor AGSM performance errors that do not impact overall AGSM
     effectiveness.
     1.5.5. ―4‖ – Outstanding. Passed; AGSM performance and G tolerance reflect full mastery
     of the AGSM.
1.6. Changes. Forward recommendations for changes through Stan Eval channels to the
MAJCOM/SG or ANG/SG to the office of primary responsibility (OPR) on an AF Form 847,

                        INITIAL TRAINING (JSUPT AND ENJJPT)

2.1. Overview. Initial Acceleration Training is a one-time requirement for all active SHGA
aircrew. Pipeline student pilots will receive this training between the primary and advanced
phases of Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) or Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot
Training (ENJJPT). Pipeline F-15E WSOs will receive this training after completion of CSO
training and prior to Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF). Aircrew who have successfully
completed Initial Training have met the centrifuge requirements for entry into the A-10 or F-15E
FTU.
2.2. DELETED.
2.3. Requirements. Completion of all training and centrifuge profiles prescribed by this section
is required. Exception: Former F-15E WSOs who have previously passed 7.5 G Qualification
Training or Initial Training, and are now a student in Undergraduate Pilot Training are not
required to complete Initial Training a second time. Training consists of the following:
2.4. Academic Instruction. Platform academic instruction covering the physiological effects of
acceleration forces, characteristics of GLOC, techniques of an effective AGSM, mishap lessons
learned, and protection offered by anti-G systems. Instructors will also accomplish an interactive
discussion on the impact of physical conditioning, lifestyle, proper nutrition, and situational
awareness on individual G-tolerance and on the effectiveness of the AGSM.
2.5. Four Centrifuge Profiles. All aircrew will train in the 13-degree (―upright‖) seat with
center stick and will accomplish the following training profiles in the order listed:
   2.5.1. First Profile. Gradual-onset run (0.1 G/s) to peripheral vision loss (approximately 60
   degrees vision loss). The purpose of this profile is to familiarize the aircrew with G-induced
   vision loss in a controlled environment, and determine the aircrew member’s resting G-
   tolerance for the training day. The anti-G suit will be worn but not inflated during this
   profile.
   2.5.2. Second Profile. G-X (6.0 G/s). The purpose of this profile is to practice the AGSM
   during the G-Warm Up and G-Awareness Exercises that compose the G-X for the T-38C.
   This profile consists of 4 G for 15 seconds, followed by 15 seconds at idle, then 5 G for 30
   seconds to represent the 90 and 180 degree turns of the T-38C G-X. The anti-G suit will be
   worn and inflated during this profile.
   2.5.3. Third Profile. Rapid-onset run (6.0 G/s) to 7.5 G for 15 seconds. The purpose of this
   profile is to establish the proper performance of the AGSM at the G-level prescribed for the
   T-38C and to establish aircrew confidence in their ability to operate in the high-G
   environment.
   2.5.4. Fourth Profile. Simulated air combat maneuvers; the aircrew tracks a target through a
   series of maneuvers at a minimum of 3 G and a maximum of 7 G. Automatic target tracking
   profile will be used for all rear cockpit aircrew. The purpose of this profile is to perform the
   AGSM in a dynamic high-G flight environment while fatigued.

   2.5.5. Debrief. Students will receive a short debrief following each profile, with emphasis
   on improving the aircrew’s AGSM performance for the next profile. After the centrifuge
   training session, each student will receive a thorough debrief including a review of the
   aircrew's videotape, written review of AGSM performance documented on AF Form 4293,
   and, if warranted, a written recommendation to the aircrew for a tailored conditioning
   program designed to increase the individual's G-tolerance.
2.6. Non-completion of Training. If training is incomplete because of factors beyond the
aircrew's control, notification is made within 24 hours to student’s commander, who will
reschedule the aircrew for another class.
2.7. Documentation. An evaluation regarding AGSM performance will be recorded on AF
Form 4293 and will be given to the student for placement in their UFT grade book for IP review.
A qualified AOP will document successful completion of training on AF Form 702. Document
training as ―Initial Centrifuge.‖
   2.7.1. Students meeting passing criteria will also have training documented in the Remarks
   section of AF Form 702 as ―AFI 11-404 Initial Acceleration Training Complete (7.5 Gz).‖
2.8. First Attempt Failure.
   2.8.1. Notification. The aerospace physiologist of record will notify the aircrew's
   commander in writing of the failure and provide a copy of the aircrew's training report and
   recommendations for improvement. HQ AFPC/DPAOT must be notified within 24 hours of
   F-15E WSO training failures.
   2.8.2. Grounding. Aircrews are not medically grounded following a failed first attempt at
   Initial Acceleration Training beyond the 12-hour automatic DNIF.
   2.8.3. Restrictions. There is no automatic restriction following first-attempt failure of Initial
   Acceleration Training. Following review of the centrifuge training record and consultation
   with the flight surgeon and the aerospace physiologist of record, the squadron commander
   may restrict pilot aircrews from solo high-G operations until successful completion of
   centrifuge retraining.
   2.8.4. Conditioning program.        The aircrew's commander or commander-designated
   representative will monitor the aircrew's progress in any recommended physical conditioning
   program. Aircrews must be afforded sufficient opportunity (minimum three times per week)
   to work on their individual conditioning program. Aircrews with weight training
   recommendations as part of this program should seek assistance from a local aerospace
   physiology officer in implementing their conditioning program.
   2.8.5. Second Attempt Training. A second attempt at Initial Training will be scheduled
   anytime between 60 and 180 days following the aircrew's first attempt failure at Initial
   Acceleration Training, or earlier with OG/CC permission. Aircrews are grounded on the
   181st day following their first attempt until satisfactory completion of retraining or
   MAJCOM or ANG waiver is approved. The second attempt Initial Acceleration Training
   program is only conducted at authorized centrifuge training facilities. A qualified aerospace
   physiologist will conduct or monitor the complete retraining program. This program is 1-3
   days in duration and consists of the following:
       2.8.5.1. Review of videotape and training report from the first training attempt.
AFI11-404 28 OCTOBER 2005                                                                       11


      2.8.5.2. Review of progress made during individual conditioning program.
      2.8.5.3. Academics tailored to the individual's original problem areas.
      2.8.5.4. Centrifuge training profiles tailored to the individual's needs. The purpose of
      these profiles is to work on the aircrew's specific problem areas as identified in the first
      attempt at Initial Acceleration Training. Additional warm-up profiles will be provided as
      necessary to prepare the aircrew for completion of the Initial Acceleration Training
      profiles. Aircrew must show consistent performance of a proper AGSM in order to
      complete the profiles. Once the aircrew satisfactorily completes these profiles, the AF
      Form 702 will be signed and no further training is necessary. The aerospace physiologist
      of record will generate a letter to the aircrew’s commander detailing AGSM performance
      during the second attempt session.
2.9. Second Attempt Failure.
   2.9.1. Notification. The aerospace physiologist of record will notify the aircrew's
   commander in writing and provide information copies to the MAJCOM/A3, MAJCOM SGP
   (or NGB/A3, NGB/SGP) of the aircrew's failure to complete retraining. Notification must
   include the reason(s) for the failure and should include any recommendations that might be
   beneficial in determining the future training ability of the aircrew.         In addition,
   AFPC/DPAOT must be notified within 24 hours of F-15E WSO’s failure to complete
   retraining.
   2.9.2. Grounding and medical evaluation. Aircrew members are medically grounded
   pending completion of a medical evaluation by a qualified flight surgeon. The purpose of this
   evaluation is to determine if there is any underlying pathology that caused or contributed to
   the aircrew's failure to complete training. Flight Surgeon of record will provide the results of
   this evaluation to the unit commander and the MAJCOM/SGP or ANG/SGP. Following
   satisfactory completion of treatment (if underlying pathology was a factor), recommendation
   by the attending flight surgeon, and concurrence by the MAJCOM/SGP or ANG/SGP, the
   aircrew may reattempt Initial Acceleration Training without prejudice. If no underlying
   pathology was discovered, then the remaining procedures in this section will be
   implemented.
   2.9.3. Student Disposition.
      2.9.3.1. UPT students that fail a second attempt at Initial Training will be re-tracked out
      of the fighter/bomber pipeline.
      2.9.3.2. F-15E WSOs, and all other non-UPT aircrew, who have failed a second attempt
      at Initial Acceleration Training will undergo an Operational Review to determine their
      final disposition.
      2.9.3.3. Operational Review. The aircrew's OG/CC or equivalent will conduct a unit-
      level operational review. The purpose of this review is to provide a recommendation to
      the MAJCOM/A3 or ANG/A3 as to whether the aircrew should receive a waiver to
      continue in their weapons system. The OG/CC must consider the aircrew's flying skill
      and experience, and then determine the aircrew's potential to develop into a successful
      SHGA aviator.

                                QUALIFICATION TRAINING

4.1. Overview. Qualification training is a one-time requirement for all active SHGA aircrews.
Experienced rated officers (as defined in this instruction) will be trained to the refresher level
described in Chapter 5. Aircrew who fail their first attempt at qualification training will attend
the retraining program between 60-180 days from first failure.
4.2. Requirements. Completion of all training and centrifuge profiles prescribed by this section
is required. Exception: A-10 FTU entry qualification centrifuge (ACC course 30-30-30)
requirement has been eliminated. Successful completion of initial acceleration training to 7.5 Gs
as part of AETC syllabus P-V4A-A (T-38C SUPT) satisfies the A-10 or F-15E FTU entry
requirements.‖
   4.2.1. Platform Academic Instruction. Minimum 2 hours of platform academic instruction
   covering the physiological effects of acceleration forces, characteristics of GLOC, techniques
   of an effective AGSM, and protection offered by current and future anti-G systems. Also
   included will be an interactive discussion of the impact of physical conditioning, lifestyle,
   proper nutrition, and situational awareness on individual G-tolerance and on the effectiveness
   of the AGSM.
   4.2.2. Five Centrifuge Profiles. F-16 candidates will train in the 30-degree reclined seat. All
   other aircrews will train in the 13-degree upright seat. The maximum G identified in each
   profile will be adjusted for MDS specific requirements. All profiles will be videotaped. The
   following are the training profiles and will be accomplished in the order listed:
       4.2.2.1. First profile. Gradual onset (0.1 G/s) to peripheral vision loss (approximately 60
       degrees vision loss). The purpose of this profile is to establish the student’s resting G-
       tolerance for that day in order to apply the appropriate AGSM intensity to the high-G
       profiles that follow. The anti-G suit will be worn but not inflated during this profile.
       4.2.2.2. Second profile. Rapid onset (6 G/s) run to 6 G for 30 seconds. The purpose of
       this run is to practice the proper AGSM at reduced G-levels. The anti-G suit is on for this
       and all subsequent runs.
       4.2.2.3. Third profile. Rapid onset (6 G/s) run for 15 seconds to 8.5 G for F-15 C/D, 9 G
       for F-16 and F/A-22, and 7.5 G for all other MDS. The purpose of this profile is to
       establish the proper performance of the AGSM at the G-level prescribed for the MDS.
       4.2.2.4. Fourth profile. Rapid onset (6 G/s) run for 10 seconds to 7 G for F-16 and F/A-
       22 and 6 G for all other MDS. This profile will be completed in the ―check 6‖ position.
       4.2.2.5. Fifth profile. Simulated air combat maneuver. The aircrew tracks a target
       through a series of maneuvers at a 3 G minimum with the maximum G tailored to the
       capabilities of the aircrew’s gaining aircraft, i.e., 9 G for F-16 and F/A-22, 8 G for F-15
       C/D/E, and 7 G for all other MDS. An automatic target-tracking profile will be used for
       all rear cockpit aircrew. The purpose of this profile is to evaluate AGSM performance
       and G/AGSM situational awareness while procedurally tasked.
   4.2.3. Debrief. Aircrews will receive a thorough debrief following each profile, with
   emphasis on improving each aircrew’s AGSM. The overall debrief will include a review of
AFI11-404 28 OCTOBER 2005                                                                     15


   the aircrew’s videotape with emphasis on the AGSM, written review of AGSM performance
   documented on AF Form 4293, and, if warranted, a written recommendation to the aircrew
   for a tailored conditioning program designed to increase the individual’s potential G-
   tolerance.
4.3. Noncompletion of Training. If training is incomplete because of factors beyond the
aircrew’s control, notification is made within 24 hrs to AFPC/DPAOT who will reschedule the
aircrew for another class. Non-completion because of aircrew performance is documented by the
Aerospace Physiologist who monitored the individual’s training.
   4.3.1. First Attempt Failure:
       4.3.1.1. Notification. The aerospace physiologist of record will notify the aircrew’s
       commander in writing of the failure and provide a copy of the aircrew’s training report
       and the recommendations for improvement discussed during the debrief. HQ
       AFPC/DPAOT must be notified within 24 hours of fighter pipeline training failures. The
       aerospace physiologist of record may recommend flight restrictions for pilots whose
       centrifuge performance indicates a significantly higher propensity for G-induced
       problems. MAJCOM or ANGRC notification for first time failures is not required.
       4.3.1.2. Grounding. Aircrews are not medically grounded following their first attempt at
       initial training beyond the 12-hour automatic DNIF.
       4.3.1.3. Restrictions. There is no automatic restriction following first-attempt failure.
       Following review of the centrifuge training record and consultation with the flight
       surgeon and the aerospace physiologist of record, the squadron commander may restrict
       pilot aircrews from solo high-G operations until successful completion of centrifuge
       retraining.
       4.3.1.4. Conditioning program. The aircrew’s commander or commander-designated
       representative will monitor the aircrew’s progress in any recommended physical
       conditioning program. Aircrews must be afforded sufficient opportunity (minimum three
       times per week) to work on their individual conditioning program. Aircrews that have
       weight training recommended as part of this program should follow guidance in AFPAM
       11-419 and seek assistance from a local aerospace physiology officer in implementing
       their conditioning program.
       4.3.1.5. Scheduling centrifuge retraining. Retraining will be scheduled for 60-180 days
       following the aircrew’s qualification training. AFPC/DPAOT will reassign a Training
       Line Number for the aircrew member to attend retraining. Travel Orders will be
       processed by the student’s MPF Formal Training Section. The commander and flight
       surgeon will review the aircrew’s progress in the conditioning program prior to
       scheduling retraining. Aircrews are grounded on the 181st day following their first
       attempt until satisfactory completion of retraining or MAJCOM/DO or ANG/XO waiver
       is approved.
       4.3.1.6. Retraining program. The retraining program is only conducted at authorized
       centrifuge training facilities. A qualified aerospace physiologist will conduct or monitor
       the complete retraining program. This program is 3 days in duration and consists of the
       following:
16                                                            AFI11-404 28 OCTOBER 2005


         4.3.1.6.1. Review of videotape and training report from the first training attempt.
         4.3.1.6.2. Review of progress made during individual conditioning program.
         4.3.1.6.3. Academics tailored to the individual’s original problem areas.
         4.3.1.6.4. Centrifuge training profiles tailored to the individual’s needs. The purpose
         of these profiles is to work on the aircrew’s specific problem areas as identified in
         qualification training. Additional warm-up profiles will be provided as necessary to
         prepare the aircrew for completion of the qualification training profiles. The aircrew
         must show consistent performance of a proper AGSM in order to complete the
         profiles. Once the aircrew satisfactorily completes these profiles, the AF Form 702
         will be signed and no further training is necessary. The aerospace physiologist of
         record will generate a letter to the aircrew’s commander detailing AGSM
         performance during the retraining session.
  4.3.2. Second Attempt Failure: (aircrew fails retraining program)
     4.3.2.1. Notification. The centrifuge facility chief will notify the aircrew’s commander
     in writing and provide an information copy to the MAJCOM/DOT/SGP or
     ANG/XOT/SGP of the aircrew’s failure to complete retraining. Notification must include
     the reasons for the failure and should include any recommendations that might be
     beneficial in determining the future training ability of the aircrew. In addition,
     AFPC/DPAOT will be notified within 24 hours of the aircrew’s failure to complete
     retraining.
     4.3.2.2. Grounding and medical evaluation. Aircrew members are medically grounded
     pending completion of a medical evaluation by a qualified flight surgeon. The purpose of
     this evaluation is to determine if there is any underlying pathology that caused or
     contributed to the aircrew’s failure to complete training. Flight Surgeon of record will
     provide the results of this evaluation to the unit commander and the MAJCOM/SGP or
     ANG/SGP. Following satisfactory completion of treatment (if underlying pathology was
     a factor), recommendation by the attending flight surgeon, and concurrence by the
     MAJCOM/SGP or ANG/SGP, the aircrew may reattempt qualification centrifuge training
     without prejudice. If no underlying pathology was discovered, then the remaining
     procedures in this section will be implemented.
     4.3.2.3. Restrictions. Following successful completion of a medical evaluation, aircrews
     may, with commander approval, resume limited flying duties. Pilots will not fly solo or
     as pilot-in-command, instructor, or flight examiner until completion of an operational
     review and approval of a MAJCOM/DO or ANG/XO waiver.
     4.3.2.4. Operational review. The aircrew’s operations group commander or equivalent
     will conduct a unit-level operational review. The purpose of this review is to provide a
     recommendation to the MAJCOM/DO or ANG/XO as to whether the aircrew should
     receive a waiver to continue in their weapons system. The operations group commander
     must consider the aircrew’s flying skill and experience, and then determine the aircrew’s
     potential to develop into a successful high-G aviator. If the aircrew is converting from a
     non-SHGA to a SHGA, or is new to HGA aviation, then the operations group commander
     will recommend either retaining the aircrew in a lower G system or approval to continue
AFI11-404 28 OCTOBER 2005                                                                     17


      in SHGA conversion. The operations group commander’s recommendation will be sent
      to the MAJCOM/DO or ANG/XO within 60 days of the aircrew’s failure of retraining.
          4.3.2.4.1. If recommended to return in lower-G SHGA the aircrew must return to the
          centrifuge training facility and complete the qualifying profile for the new MDS.
      4.3.2.5. MAJCOM/ANG review. The MAJCOM/SGP or ANG/SGP will review the
      centrifuge training reports and recommendations and the medical evaluation report, and
      they may review the aircrew’s centrifuge training videotapes (if desired). Based on the
      medical and physiological review, the MAJCOM/SGP or ANG/SGP will provide a
      recommendation to the MAJCOM/DOT or ANG/XOT as to the aircrew’s potential to
      tolerate the high-G environment. The MAJCOM/DOT or ANG/XOT will review the
      operations group commander and MAJCOM/SGP or ANG/SGP recommendations and
      prepare a consolidated position to the MAJCOM/DO or ANG/XO. The MAJCOM/DO or
      ANG/XO is the final authority in determining whether the aircrew is retained in their
      weapon system, whether approved to continue conversion, or if the aircrew should be
      reassigned to a low-G weapon system.
4.4. Waiver Procedures. Waiver requests must be by name and submitted in writing with
appropriate justification through the NAF/DO to the MAJCOM/DO. NAF will screen requests
and recommend concurrence or nonoccurrence to the MAJCOM/DO. All requests for waivers
for the ANG will be submitted directly to the ANG/XO. The MAJCOM/DO or ANG/XO is the
final waiver authority.
   4.4.1. Waivers to qualification training will be considered for the following circumstances:
      4.4.1.1. Unit is converting from non-SHGA or a lower-G SHGA to SHGA and aircrew
      will not convert.
      4.4.1.2. Aircrew is separating from the Air Force or retiring within 90 days (6 months for
      ANG aircrew) of when the aircrew would otherwise be required to attend training.
      4.4.1.3. Aircrew failed qualification and retraining, but was recommended to continue in
      SHGA (paragraph 4.3.2.5). An approved waiver to the training requirement also
      constitutes a waiver to the formal course entry prerequisite for aircrew members who are
      enrolled in or en route to a formal training course.
4.5. Documentation. A qualified aerospace physiologist will document completion of training
on AF Form 702 will reflect MDS specific qualification,―AFI 11-404 Qualification Centrifuge
Training Complete, 9 Gz‖ (F-16, F/A-22), ―AFI 11-404 Qualification Centrifuge Training
Complete, 8.5 Gz‖ (F-15C), or ―AFI 11-404 Qualification Centrifuge Training Complete, 7.5
Gz‖ (all other SHGA).

                                          Chapter 5

                                  REFRESHER TRAINING

5.1. Overview. Refresher training is designed for aircrews who are being reassigned to high-G
aircraft following a non-flying assignment or who are converting from a non-SHGA or lower-G
SHGA to a SHGA. Refresher training requires aircrew to successfully complete training at the
MDS G level (Chapter 4).
5.2. Applicability:
   5.2.1. All experienced rated officers who have not previously completed qualification
   training. ―Exception: Experienced fighter aircrews previously centrifuge qualified at 7.5 G or
   above have solid foundations in G-awareness, flight discipline and ORM for the employment
   envelope and will not require refresher training if returning to the T-38, A-10 or F-15E
   aircraft.‖
   5.2.2. Aircrews returning to SHGA from 3 or more years in a non-flying position or
   converting to a SHGA from 3 years in a non-SHGA. The 3 years are counted from the last
   flight as an assigned active high-G aircrew in a SHGA to formal course entry date (report
   not-later-than for aircrews who won’t attend a formal course en route to their gaining unit).
   5.2.3. Aircrew upgrading from a SHGA to a higher-G SHGA (i.e. aircrew converting from
   A-10/T-38/F-15E to F-15C/D/F-16/F/A-22) must accomplish centrifuge refresher training to
   the MDS qualifying G-level.
       5.2.3.1. Aircrew transitioning from the F-15C/D to the F-16 or F/A-22 do not require
       centrifuge training unless required by 5.2.1, 5.2.2, 5.2.3, or 5.2.4.
   5.2.4. Aircrews on MAJCOM and ANGRC waivers for failure of qualification training
   (paragraph 4.4.1.3) require refresher training every year or until aircrew passes MDS specific
   qualifying profile. Once qualification training profiles are successfully completed, the
   aircrew’s AF Form 702 will be documented accordingly; the waiver will be rescinded; and
   no further refresher training will be required (unless directed by paragraph 5.2.3 or Chapter
   6).
5.3. Requirements. Completion of all training prescribed by this section is required; except, in
the event of an equipment malfunction, training may be completed without profile 4. Training
consists of the following:
   5.3.1. Platform Academic Instruction. Minimum 2 hours of platform academic instruction
   covering the physiological effects of acceleration forces, characteristics of GLOC, techniques
   of an effective AGSM, mishap lessons learned, and protection offered by current and future
   anti-G systems. Also, included will be an interactive discussion of the impact of physical
   conditioning, lifestyle, proper nutrition, and situational awareness on individual G-tolerance
   and on the effectiveness of the AGSM.
   5.3.2. Four Centrifuge Profiles. Aircrews currently flying or converting to the F-16 will
   train in the 30-degree reclined seat. All other aircrews will train in the 13-degree up-right
   seat. All profiles will be videotaped. The following are refresher training profiles and will
   be accomplished in the order listed:
AFI11-404 28 OCTOBER 2005                                                                        19


       5.3.2.1. First profile. Gradual-onset run (0.1 G/s) to peripheral vision loss (approximately
       60 degrees vision loss). The purpose of this profile is to establish the student’s resting G-
       tolerance for that day in order to apply the appropriate AGSM intensity to the high-G
       profiles that follow. The anti-G suit will be worn but not inflated during this profile.
       5.3.2.2. Second profile. Rapid-onset run to 6 G for 10 seconds during ―check 6‖
       position. The anti-G suit is connected for this and all subsequent runs.
       5.3.2.3. Third profile. Rapid-onset run to MDS specified qualification profile (paragraph
       4.2.2.3) for 15 seconds. The purpose of this run is to demonstrate the proper AGSM.
       5.3.2.4. Fourth profile. Simulated air combat maneuver; the aircrew tracks a target
       through a series of maneuvers at a minimum of 3 G and a maximum of 7 G (8 G for F-16,
       F/A-22). Automatic target tracking profile will be used for all rear cockpit aircrew.
   5.3.3. Debrief. Aircrews will receive a verbal and written debrief following each profile,
   with emphasis on improving the aircrew’s AGSM. The overall debrief will include a review
   of the aircrew’s videotape with emphasis on the AGSM and, if warranted, a written
   recommendation to the aircrew for a tailored conditioning program designed to increase the
   individual’s potential G-tolerance. Written documentation of training debrief will be
   performed on the AF Form 4293.
5.4. Non-completion of Training. If training is incomplete due to factors beyond the aircrew’s
control, no actions are required beyond rescheduling of training. Recommendation for non-
completion due to aircrew performance is made by the aerospace physiologist who monitored the
individual’s training. Once this recommendation is validated, the procedures in this section will
be implemented.
   5.4.1. Notification. The Aerospace Physiologist will notify the aircrew’s commander in
   writing of the failure and provide a copy of the aircrew’s training report and the tailored
   conditioning program recommended in the debrief.
   5.4.2. Grounding. Aircrews are not medically grounded following refresher training beyond
   the 12-hour automatic DNIF.
   5.4.3. Restrictions. There is no automatic restriction following failure of refresher training.
   Following a review of the centrifuge training record and consultation with the flight surgeon
   and the centrifuge facility chief, the squadron commander may restrict pilot aircrews from
   solo high-G operations until successful completion of an operational review.
   5.4.4. Conditioning Program. The aircrew’s commander or commander-designated
   representative will monitor the aircrew’s progress in the conditioning program. The aircrew
   must be afforded sufficient opportunity (minimum 3 times per week) to work on their
   individual conditioning program. Aircrews that have weight training recommended as part of
   this program should seek guidance in AFPAM 11-419 and assistance from a local aerospace
   physiologist in establishing their program.
   5.4.5. Operational Review. The aircrew’s operations group commander or equivalent will
   conduct a unit-level operational review. The purpose of this review is to provide a
   recommendation to the MAJCOM/DO or ANG/XO as to whether the aircrew should receive
   a waiver to continue in their weapons system. The operations group commander must
   consider the aircrew’s flying skill and experience, and then determine the aircrew’s potential
 20                                                            AFI11-404 28 OCTOBER 2005


   to develop into a successful high-G aviator. If the aircrew is converting from a SHGA to a
   higher-G SHGA, or is new to SHGA aviation, then the operations group commander will
   recommend either retraining the aircrew in a lower G system or approval to continue in
   SHGA conversion. The operations group commander’s recommendation will be sent to the
   MAJCOM/DO or ANG/XO within 60 days of the aircrew’s failure of retraining.
   5.4.6. MAJCOM/ANGRC review. The MAJCOM/SGP or ANG/SGP will review the
   centrifuge training reports and recommendations and the medical evaluation report, and they
   may review the aircrew’s centrifuge training videotapes (if desired). Based on the medical
   and physiological review, the MAJCOM/SGP or ANG/SGP will provide a recommendation
   to the MAJCOM/DOT or ANG/XOT as to the aircrew’s potential to tolerate the high-G
   environment. The MAJCOM/DOT or ANG/XOT will review the operations group
   commander and MAJCOM/SGP or ANG/SGP recommendations and prepare a consolidated
   position to the MAJCOM/DO or ANG/XO. The MAJCOM/DO or ANG/XO is the final
   authority in determining whether the aircrew is retained in their weapon system, whether
   approved to continue conversion, or if the aircrew should be reassigned to a low-G weapon
   system.
5.5. Waiver Procedures. Waiver requests must be by name and submitted in writing, with
appropriate justification, through the NAF/DO to the MAJCOM/DO. The NAF will screen
requests and recommend concurrence or non-concurrence to the MAJCOM/DO. All requests for
waivers for the ANG will be submitted directly to the ANG/XO. The MAJCOM/DO or
ANG/XO is the final waiver authority.
   5.5.1. Waivers to refresher training will be considered for the following circumstances:
      5.5.1.1. Experienced rated officer who was unable to complete training.
      5.5.1.2. Other aircrews who attended training that was not in conjunction with
      conversion to a high-G aircraft.
      5.5.1.3. Aircrews recommended continuing in SHGA following their operational review.
   5.5.2. An approved waiver to the refresher training requirement also constitutes a waiver to
   the formal course entry prerequisite for aircrews that are enrolled in or en route to a formal
   training course.
   5.5.3. Aircrews on approved refresher training waivers do not require further centrifuge
   training except as directed by Chapter 6, Commander-Directed Acceleration Training.
5.6. Documentation. A qualified aerospace physiologist will document completion of training
on AF Form 702. Documentation will reflect MDS specific qualification, ―AFI 11-404
Qualification Centrifuge Training Complete, 9 Gz‖ (F-16, F/A-22), ―AFI 11-404 Qualification
Centrifuge Training Complete, 8.5 Gz‖ (F-15C), or ―AFI 11-404 Qualification Centrifuge
Training Complete, 7.5 Gz‖ (all other SHGA).

                          COMMANDER-DIRECTED TRAINING

6.1. Overview. Commander-directed acceleration training (CDAT) is a tool used by an
organizational commander to evaluate and improve an aircrew’s performance under G.
Following medical evaluation by flight surgeon and videotape review by flight supervision,
flight surgeon, or aerospace physiologist, recommendation can be made for CDAT.
6.2. Applicability. Any aircrew member may return at the discretion of his or her commander
following an in-flight GLOC incident or when directed to improve their performance under G.
Commanders will use the evaluation from CDAT outcome to direct follow-on training. This may
include, but is not limited to, continued pipeline training, further acceleration training, or
removal from SHGA pipeline training. Commanders-directed course of action will be
documented in the student’s grade book.
6.3. Retraining program. The retraining program is only conducted at authorized centrifuge
training facilities. A qualified aerospace physiologist will conduct or monitor the complete
retraining program. This program is 3 days in duration and consists of the following:
   6.3.1. Review of available in-flight tapes.
   6.3.2. Review of individual conditioning program.
   6.3.3. Analysis and review of individual AGSM performance.
   6.3.4. Centrifuge training profiles tailored to the individual’s needs. The purpose of these
   profiles is to work on the aircrew’s specific problem areas. This may include training with
   COMBAT EDGE equipment.
6.4. Evaluation Criteria. Successful completion of CDAT is based on the following criteria:
   6.4.1. T-37/T-38/T-6 training phase requires the individual to successfully complete the PIT
   profiles identified in Chapter 3.
   6.4.2. All other evaluations require the individual to meet the standards identified in
   Chapter 4.
6.5. Notification. The aerospace physiologist will notify the aircrew’s commander in writing of
the aircrew’s training and progress. These may include recommendations of flight restrictions
for pilots whose centrifuge performance indicates a significantly higher propensity for G-induced
problems.

                                           REPORTING

7.1. Overview. Completion of centrifuge training is documented on the AF Form 702 as
described in this instruction. Notification of non-completion is also accomplished according to
this instruction. The centrifuge training facility will provide an end-of-calendar year report to its
MAJCOM/DO/SG and AFMSA/SGPA which delineates the following (with anonymity):
   7.1.1. Number of persons (by aircrew mission design series (MDS) and crew position) who
   attended training by training program.
   7.1.2. Number of failures and rate by training program, MDS, and crew position.
   Consolidate reasons for failures and provide separate list with rates (e.g. GLOC--10 percent,
   inadequate AGSM--75 percent, poor physical condition--20 percent, etc.).
   7.1.3. Injuries or medical problems, in association with training, by aircrew MDS.
   7.1.4. Synopsis of critique comments. Only include comments directed at the overall
   program or policies. Comments on the facility or its personnel need not be sent forward.
   7.1.5. Specific comments or recommendations by the facility chief regarding program policy
   or procedures.
7.2. Videotape Disposition. The videotapes of aircrew centrifuge training are controlled items.
The centrifuge training facility will maintain original videotapes according to AFMAN 37-139,
Records Disposition Schedule. The release of student videotapes will only be made to
authorized personnel with permission from the MAJCOM/SGP or ANG/SGP. The centrifuge
facility will copy only the training profiles for the individual aircrew requested by the
MAJCOM/SGP or ANG/SGP. This copy will be labeled ―for official use only‖ and afforded
protection from unauthorized disclosure.
7.3. Individual Records. Flying units will track qualification centrifuge training in Aviation
Resource Management System (ARMS) and in individual flight records IAW AFI 11-421,
Aviation Resource Management. Aircrew records should be screened annually to determine
when the aircrew, if any, on waivers will require refresher training. Units will also develop a
method to track refresher training attendance and completion.
   7.3.1. The centrifuge training facility will maintain individual aircrew training records
   according to AFI 37-139. This will serve as a back-up to flying unit records.
   7.3.2. The training reports maintained by the centrifuge facility may be released to the
   aircrew’s commander, MAJCOM/DOT, or MAJCOM/SGP (ANG/XOT/SGP for ANG
   aircrew). Requests for release of individual training reports to other agencies must be
   approved by the MAJCOM/DOT or ANG/XOT. These reports are ―for official use only‖
   and afforded protection from unauthorized disclosure.
