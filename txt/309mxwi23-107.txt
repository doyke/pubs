This instruction provides guidance for the production support technician/production support
specialist (PST/PSS) on how to report demand data to Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) source
of supply (SOS), when a depot maintenance requirement is satisfied through other than normal
supply channels. Processes pertaining to organizations other than the 309th Maintenance Wing
(309 MXW) are not meant to be directive, but only describes the touch points and hand-offs
between the 309 MXW, and the other organizations. This procedure augments the process
outlined in Air Force Materiel Command Instruction (AFMCI) 21-130, Depot Maintenance
Materiel Control, Chapter 2, Section 33 “Recovering Unbudgeted Workaround Costs Caused by
Parts Shortages”. This instruction does not apply to 309th Aerospace Maintenance and
Regeneration Group (309 AMARG). Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual
(AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of IAW the Air Force Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

1. General Information. Materiel shortages at DLA SOS often result in accomplishing
workarounds for depot maintenance. When workaround methods are used to acquire needed
materiel, the requirements are not passed to the supplier DLA, and the suppliers historical
forecast is not accurate. This results in under purchasing, and stocking items for the depot
maintenance wing. A manual method of updating the materiel demand/requirement to DLA, is
achieved through the use of a demand history adjustment (DHA) transaction in the Wholesale
and Retail Receiving and Shipping System (WARRS/D035K). The PST/PSS is required to
communicate those demands to DLA for DHA processing. DHAs are processed by DLA
personnel for DLA SOS business systems modernization item (SMS) (managed items only), and
are not used to communicate demands for Air Force-managed SOS. In addition, the Depot
Maintenance Support System (G005M) bill of materiel may require updating by the planner as
needed. The preferred method and frequency for submitting DHAs, is to notify the DLA
customer support specialist (CSS) at the time the part is consumed, and the SOS could not fill the
demand.
     1.1. The DHA checklist (Attachment 2) provides common types of workarounds; normally
     used when materiel cannot be acquired from the SOS, and will necessitate the need for a
     DHA transaction. There should already be a backorder in the system, and the estimated
     delivery date does not meet the required delivery date.
        1.1.1. Cannibalization/Temporary Reclamation (Air Force Materiel Command {AFMC}
        Form 206, Temporary Work Request, is required): Removing materiel components from
        an end item not being overhauled;
        1.1.2. Materiel acquired from the Defense Reutilization Marketing Service (DRMS);
        1.1.3. Materiel acquired from AMARG;
309MXWI23-107 24 AUGUST 2011                                                                     3


       1.1.4. Local manufactured materiel acquired directly through local manufacturing
       facilities;
       1.1.5. Materiel acquired on the government purchase card (GPC);
       1.1.6. Equipment Specialist approved route/repair process for DLA materiel (AFMC
       Form 202, Nonconforming Technical Assistance Request and Reply, is required).
       NOTE: Local purchase/local manufacture processed through the DLA priority cell, does
       not need to be reported by 309 MXW personnel; DLA will submit the DHAs in these
       instances.
   1.2. If the intent of maintenance is to continue to satisfy requirements through workaround
   methods (i.e., technical orders changed to directed reclamation/reuse of parts), or the materiel
   is no longer going to be requisitioned through DLA in the future, the demand should not be
   reported to DLA for DHA processing.
       1.2.1. Because DHA transactions do not overlay or update the interfacing maintenance
       systems (i.e., G005M), no materiel usage (replacement percentage) or cost data is
       updated. Therefore, the data needs to be provided to the materiel planner for manual
       updates to replacement factors in G005M. NOTE: To minimize updates to G005M, the
       desired method is for the PST/PSS to place an order in Automated Bill of Materiel
       System (ABOM). If a workaround is required, and the backorder is not needed or cannot
       be moved to another end item, request cancellation of the item and notify DLA to process
       DHA.
       1.2.2. All workarounds will impact the suppliers’ historical requirements and buying
       patterns. The workarounds will be submitted to the demand forecasting specialist (DFS),
       or the process initiator for analysis to determine if the workaround quantity will affect
       future requirements. If it’s a maintenance demand trigger, the requirements will be
       passed to planning for DLA managed consumables (PDMC) cell for demand data
       exchange (DDE) processing.
       1.2.3. All demands satisfied by a workaround, must be communicated to DLA within the
       current month. DHA transactions will not be used as a method to collect historical data,
       and input large quantities to the SOS to “catch-up” for previous workaround situations.
       The demand data should be reported to DLA at the time of issue to the end
       item/consumption.
   1.2.4. In all instances, the PST/PSS will ensure the quantity reported for DHA processing
   matches the item purchased/received, the quantity on the AFMC Form 206, or exact GPC
   buy. The quantity for the DHA cannot exceed the quantity per assembly.
2. Responsibilities.
   2.1. The production mechanic will notify the PST/PSS when the estimated deliver date is not
   acceptable, and a workaround is required.
   2.2. The PST/PSS will report the workaround demand data to DLA CSS, when a back order
   is cancelled due to the materiel requirement being satisfied by a workaround.
   2.3. DLA processes the DHA; the PST/PSS will request confirmation from DLA when the
   DHA is processed. The PST/PSS will retain a copy of confirmation (i.e., signature on
   spreadsheet, screen prints, or report) for 6 months. NOTE: Maintenance Overhaul and
 4                                                           309MXWI23-107 24 AUGUST 2011


     Repair Impresa System (IMPRESA) users will run the validation report, and retain for 6
     months.
3. IMPRESA Procedures to Capture DHA Information.
     3.1. The PST/PSS will run the DHA summary report (see Attachment 3) in maintenance
     repair overhaul application in IMPRESA for the prior month, and send the DHA information
     to DLA CSS in a spreadsheet.
        3.1.1. PST/PSS receives email confirmation from DLA point of contact by the 15th of
        each month, with the actions taken for the DHAs.
        3.1.2. PST/PSS will run the validation report from IMPRESA and combine with
        confirmation, and file for 6 months.
        3.1.3. Review the save flag process (see Attachment 4) for items subject to the
        IMPRESA reclamation process.
4. Non-IMPRESA Procedures to Capture DHA Information.
     4.1. Mechanic will notify PST/PSS if reclaim materiel has been used by following non-
     IMPRESA procedures (see Attachment 5).
     4.2. PST/PSS will work closely with production in identifying insufficient required delivery
     dates and workarounds.
     4.3. PST/PSS will document required workarounds on DHA spreadsheet (see Attachment 6)
     to include: national stock number (NSN), noun, quantity, and type of workaround. This
     information will be given to DLA CSS for the DHA input. NOTE: The DHA requirement
     will be added to the spreadsheet, and given to DLA CSS at the time of requirement; do not
     use a monthly total.
     4.4. If the backorder is no longer required, request cancellation through DLA.
5. Notification of Demand in WARRS/D035K (Kadena).
     5.1. The Demand History Data Inquiry (DHAA) screen (Attachment 7.1.) provides a 90-day
     history of past workarounds for specific NSNs. The “Date From” and “Date To” fields are
     optional. If the “Date From” field is left blank, it will use a default date of 90-days prior to
     the current date. If the “Date To” field is left blank, it will default to the current date.
        5.1.1. If a document number is entered, 90 days of data will be displayed. When
        entering data to “Date To/Date From” field, it must contain the current year (i.e., 2011)
        and the Julian date (see Attachment 7.2.).
        5.1.2. If the DHAA history screen indicates an “R” in position 7 of the response screen,
        the document is a reversal (see Attachment 7.3.).
     5.2. The Initiate DHA Demand Transaction (DHAB) screen (Attachment 8.1.) allows users
     to initiate a transaction that will provide DLA SOS with demand data that was not reported
     through the normal supply chain. This establishes demand history at the SOS for future
     procurement.
309MXWI23-107 24 AUGUST 2011                                                                   5


      5.2.1. On the DHAB screen (see Attachment 8.2.), the NSN, and quantity must be
      entered by the user. The WARRS/D035K system will automatically assign the routing
      ID, the unit of issue, priority, and the document number (see Attachment 8.3.).
      5.2.2. A priority of 01-15 may be entered; however if left blank, a priority of 15 will be
      assigned (see Attachment 8.4.).
      5.2.3. When entering/return key is pressed, the assigned data will be highlighted, and the
      user will be prompted to press the F9 key to process the transaction. Once the F9 key is
      pressed, a notice should appear on the left hand bottom portion of the screen stating
      “Processing Successfully Completed” (see Attachment 8.5.).
   5.3. The Initiate DHA Demand Reversal (DHAC) screen (Attachment 9.1.) allows users to
   initiate a transaction that will reverse, or modify the demand quantity that was previously
   submitted to DLA SOS using the DHAB screen.
      5.3.1. On the DHAC screen, enter the NSN, document number, and entire demand
      quantity or any portion of the originally submitted demand quantity requiring reversal
      action (see Attachment 9.2.). Once data is entered into the fields, press enter/return. The
      system will provide all the remaining fields of data for the original DHAB (see
      Attachment 9.3.). NOTE: If no record is found, an error message will appear on the
      screen. A reversal action cannot be processed if there is no corresponding record in the
      history file.
      5.3.2. When the enter/return key is pressed, the assigned data will be highlighted and the
      user will be prompted to press the F9 key to process the transaction. Once the F9 key is
      pressed, a notice should appear on the left hand bottom portion of screen stating
      “Processing Successfully Completed” (see Attachment 9.4.).
   5.3.3. Once the reversal is accomplished, process a DHAA inquiry (see Attachment 10) to
   ensure the reversal transaction has posted.
5.4. Demand/Repair Cycle Data File Maintenance (ZF9).
      5.4.1. Retail demand data also requires update when the maintenance requirement has
      not been reported in the WARRS/D035K system. This is accomplished by processing a
      ZF9 (see Attachment 11.1.) transaction into the WARRS/D035K system. This allows the
      number of demands, and the quantity of those demands to be updated for inclusion when
      WARRS/D035K is computing retail stock levels (see Attachment 11.2.).
      5.4.2. These procedures will only be used in those situations where an actual demand has
      been satisfied through either a cannibalization, reclaim or GPC buy, and will not be used
      as a means of building demand history (see Attachment 11.3.). NOTE: ZF9s will not be
      processed for any other scenario.
6                                                      309MXWI23-107 24 AUGUST 2011



    5.4.3. The section analyst will document on the ZF9 screen print with the justification for
    the ZF9, the date processed, and their signature (see Attachment 11.4.). The ZF9 screen
    print will be attached to the DHA screen print provided by the retail item manager, and
    kept on file for 1 year.
