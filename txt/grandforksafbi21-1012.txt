This instruction assigns responsibilities and prescribes procedures for an effective FOD
Prevention Program. All military, civilian, and contractor personnel assigned and/or attached to
the 319th Air Base Wing (319 ABW) working in, on, around, or traveling through flightline
areas or near aircraft, engines, and Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) will comply with FOD
prevention measures. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained in accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of IAW with the Air Force Records Information
Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). Refer recommended
changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)

1. Responsibilities
     1.1. The 319th Operations Support Squadron Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE) will be the
     (FOD) Monitor.
     1.2. Every unit that performs operations on or around the flightline will designate a FOD
     Prevention Program Manager. Commanders will make appointments in writing and forward
     to the wing FOD Monitor.
     1.3. FOD Prevention Committee Meeting: FOD prevention committee meetings will be
     conducted quarterly as long as the wing does not exceed the established preventable FOD
     rate. If the wing exceeds the FOD rate, meetings will be held monthly. The ABW/CV chairs
     the meeting (OSS/CC may chair the meeting in the ABW/CV’s absence). At a minimum,
     group commanders, director(s), commanders of units with maintenance personnel, wing
     safety officer, civil engineering, airfield manager, transportation, and security forces will
     attend the meetings. All FOD Prevention Program Managers and maintenance supervisors
     will attend quarterly FOD/Dropped Object Prevention (DOP) briefings. The 319 ABW FOD
     prevention committee chairperson will incorporate tenant units in the host unit program.
     Tenant units should establish their own unit FOD committee, but will participate in the host
     program and comply with host program requirements.
        1.3.1. FOD rates are computed by MDS as follows: Number of Preventable FODs
        (damage exceeding $50K) ÷ Aircraft flying hours X 10,000 = FOD rate.
        1.3.2. The preventable FOD rate for Mobility Air Forces (MAF) aircraft is 3.0 with a
        goal of FOD elimination for preventable mishaps.
     1.4. All units’ members are responsible for FOD control as it pertains to daily activities on
     or around the flightline IAW AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance
     Management. Every individual will accomplish a thorough check at the completion of all
     maintenance activities while working around aircraft, engines, AGE, and associated work
     areas to remove potential FOD hazards. Maintenance production areas will have approved
     FOD containers readily accessible in the work place. Vehicles normally driven on the
     flightline will be equipped with secured and lidded FOD containers marked IAW AFI 21-101.
2. Procedures:
     2.1. FOD Walks: FOD walks will be conducted weekly, usually on Friday, weather
     permitting, as determined by the wing FOD monitor. The aircraft parking ramp and
     associated work areas must remain clear of foreign objects and debris that could damage
     aircraft engines, tires, or other equipment.
        2.1.1. In addition, transient alert and tenant units with flying missions will conduct FOD
        walks prior to recovery of aircraft, as well as Pre/Post launch FOD walks in the
        respective parking ramps.
            2.1.1.1. Assigned FOD walk areas are shown on the map (Attachment 3) as follows:
            2.1.1.2. 319 OSS Bravo ramp, and Charlie ramp spots 7-18.
            2.1.1.3. 69 RG (ACC) 600 series hangars ramp area, Charlie ramp spots 1-6, 19-24
            and spots 25-32.
            2.1.1.4. 119 AW (ANG) 3-bay hangar ramp area.
GRANDFORKSAFBI21-1012 3 OCTOBER 2014                                                            3


     2.1.2. Units with facilities in close proximity to the flightline will perform weekly FOD
     walks around those flightline structures and associated work areas.
     2.1.3. 319 OSS/QAE or work center supervisors (other units) will supervise the FOD
     walk and scan the areas after completion to determine if another FOD walk is necessary.
     2.1.4. To augment the effectiveness of FOD walks when paved flightline surfaces are
     free of snow and ice, the tow-behind “FOD Boss” unit will be utilized on FOD walk
     responsibility areas. 319 OSS personnel will perform a “FOD Boss” sweep of the OSS
     areas once a month. 69 RG personnel will perform a “FOD Boss” sweep of their areas of
     responsibility once a month.
     2.1.5. 319 OSS AGE will store and maintain one “FOD Boss” as part of their
     Consolidated Tool Kit (CTK). “FOD Boss” units will be issued just as any other piece of
     equipment and marked IAW AFI 21-101. CTK sections will perform periodic inspections
     IAW TO 1-1A-15.
     2.1.6. 69 RG will store and maintain one “FOD Boss” as part of their Consolidated Tool
     Kit (CTK). “FOD Boss” units will be issued just as any other piece of equipment and
     marked IAW AFI 21-101. CTK sections will perform periodic inspections IAW TO 1-1A-15.
     2.1.7. 319 OSS/QAE may use the “golden bolt,” placed in a FOD walk area as an
     incentive to members participating in weekly FOD walks. The member who finds the
     “golden bolt” will receive a 1-day pass. Significant contributions to the “golden bolt”
     program will be recognized at the quarterly FOD prevention meeting. Every base
     organization is encouraged to participate in weekly FOD walks. Units not assigned a
     specific FOD walk area of responsibility by this instruction may coordinate participation
     through 319 OSS/QAE not later than close of business the Wednesday prior.
     2.1.8. Vehicle operators will stop and perform a visual FOD inspection on all equipment and
     tires prior to entering the flightline areas. In addition, tire checks are required whenever
     vehicles leave the paved or unimproved surfaces. Vehicle operators are required to stop and
     check tires for foreign objects prior to returning to the aircraft movement area to include
     runway, taxiways, and aprons IAW GFAFBI 13-213, Airfield Driving. Roll-over FOD checks
     will be accomplished by checking all exposed surfaces of the tires then proceeding forward to
     allow a check of that portion of the tire which was unexposed.
     2.1.9. Vehicle operators are responsible for picking up FOD wherever found. FOD clean-up
     requiring sweeper support will be reported to Airfield Management immediately.
  2.2. Restricted area badges will be secured with a subdued nylon/cotton cord or plastic
  armband. Metal insignia/badges will not be worn on the flightline. Hats/berets will not be
  worn on the flightline within the vicinity of operating jet engines. Exception:
  Headgear/clothing authorized for extreme cold weather protection may be worn; however,
  make every effort to prevent such headgear from coming loose during duty performance.
  Special attention to the FOD potential and safety of personnel will be the prime
  considerations when determining extreme cold weather clothing authorizations.
  2.3. Personal tools are not authorized on the flightline or any maintenance area.
