A23.1.1. Adhere to the cardinal Principle of Explosives Safety: Personnel will be assigned duty
positions, documented in the crew briefing. Each fire extinguisher maintenance crew will
consist of at least two personnel, but no more than four. One person on the crew will be
designated as the task supervisor. No more than 20 fire extinguisher cartridges will be in an
Electro/Environmental squib team’s possession at any one time. This accounts for 10 (8
engine/2 APU) aircraft squibs being removed and 10 (8 engine/2 APU) new ones being installed
from supply.
A23.1.2. Industrial safety practices dictate use of the buddy system.
A23.1.3. Supervisors must be qualified on the task they are supervising and crewmembers must
be at least opened on the task and associated safety tasks in their training records.
A23.1.4. Ensure applicable technical order WARNINGS, CAUTIONS, and NOTES are briefed
prior to the start of any explosive operation. All personnel will watch for dangerous conditions or
situations and take appropriate actions to prevent mishaps.
A23.1.5. Explosive operation warning signs and appropriate fire symbol placards will be placed
at all accessible entrances to explosive maintenance operations when explosive operations are in
progress.
A23.2. Transportation and Handling.
A23.2.1. Should a vehicle transporting squibs develop a fire, it will be cleared from the aircraft
parking area, buildings and other vehicles, and stopped as soon as possible. The vehicle operator
will attempt to extinguish the fire and notify Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) using the
maintenance net or contacting the Fire Department by telephone. Evacuate the area to a distance
of 300 feet and inform the Fire Department of approximate time squibs were engulfed in flames.
A23.2.2. Do not perform unnecessary tasks in the immediate area of an explosive operation.
A23.2.3. Locate and ensure emergency exits are unlocked and marked aisle ways are clear of
obstacles at all times.
A23.2.4. Ensure explosive placards are attached to transport vehicle and/or trailer as applicable.
A23.3. Restraints.
A23.3.1. Exercise extreme caution during icy and inclement weather conditions. Slippery
conditions can necessitate increased use of tie-downs.
A23.3.2. Secure all items according to applicable technical data prior to transportation.
A23.4. Briefing Guide Use this safety briefing to ensure you give a comprehensive safety
briefing prior to starting any operation. Ensure all pre-use and post-use inspections of munitions
are performed as outlined in each individual munitions Item Technical Order. Update the
briefing as minor changes occur, but re-accomplish the entire briefing anytime the operation to

                           ADVERSE WEATHER PROCEDURES

A35.1. The Wing Commander will be responsible for the direction of aircraft evacuation as
required. Squadron commanders are responsible for the removal of all snow and ice from
assigned facilities. OI 21-26, 2
A35.1.1. High Winds. OI 21-26, 4
A35.1.1.1. When wind speeds/gusts are expected to exceed 20 knots and maintenance is not
being performed, production supervisors will ensure all radomes, panels, and engine cowlings
are closed and secured and high-profile equipment is secured in hangars. When maintenance is
being performed, radomes, panels, and engine cowls may remain open, but will be closed upon
completion of the task. Safety of personnel and aircraft is paramount. Also, all Aerospace
Ground Equipment (AGE) will be checked and parking brake/wheel locks set. Production
supervisors will keep the MOC informed of the progress in securing their aircraft/areas.
A35.1.2. When winds/gusts are expected to exceed 35knots,production supervisors will ensure
all aircraft flaps are in the full up position, aircraft doors (including cargo door) and windows are
closed, outside fuel systems maintenance is suspended and the use of deicers is prohibited.
Unattended AGE on the flight line will be removed or secured. The AGE Flight will ensure all
maintenance stands (B-4, B-5, etc) are placed in a hangar as directed by Maintenance Squadron
supervision. Production Supervisor will ensure aircraft subjected to 35 knot winds from an aft
direction are inspected IAW 1C-135-6, and aircraft exposed to 35 knot winds while control locks
or securing devices installed will be inspected immediately. Aircraft scheduled to fly may be
opened up 3 hours prior to launch for crew show preparation procedures.
A35.1.2.1. Hangar doors on buildings 1029, 1033, and 1037 will not be operated during
sustained winds of 35 knots and higher without approval and support from Civil Engineering
(CE).
A35.1.3. When winds/gusts are expected to exceed 65 knots, production supervisors will
position the aircraft to head into the wind when possible and the MOC will coordinate taxi crews
as needed. All aircraft will be configured with the nose landing gear aligned with the fuselage
and the leading edge of the stabilizers at zero. Aircraft in temporary docks or nose docks will be
towed clear when possible. The flight line will be purged of all non-essential equipment.
Essential equipment will be positioned to reduce the possibility of damage or movement.
A35.1.4. Aircraft will not be jacked unless fully inside a hangar when winds are expected to
exceed 20 knots, including nose and main gear axle jacks. Aircraft already on jacks do not need
to be down jacked unless winds are expected to exceed 40 knots.
A35.2. Extreme Cold OI 21-26, 4.3
A35.2.1. When temperatures reach -10F or colder (including wind chill factor), supervisors will
ensure personnel have proper clothing and are briefed on frostbite symptoms.
A35.2.2. When temperatures reach –25F (including wind chill factor), supervisors will ensure
