                                             Chapter 1

                                  GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. Conduct all evaluations IAW the provisions of AFI 11-401, Aviation
Management, AFI 11-202V2, and this volume.
     1.1.1. Air Combat Command, C2ISR Operations Division (ACC/A3C), has overall
     responsibility for administration of this AFI.
     1.1.2. Copies will be current and available to planning staffs from headquarters to aircrew
     level.
1.2. Recommended Changes/Waivers. Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this
AFI under normal circumstances. If an urgent requirement or emergency dictates otherwise, the
pilot in command, or instructor, will take the appropriate action to safely recover the air vehicle.
     1.2.1. Submit proposed changes to this AFI through appropriate channels to ACC/A3CH
     according to AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program (FMP). Use AF Form 847,
     Recommendation for Change of Publication.
     1.2.2. When a controlling source publication changes, that publication takes precedence until
     the change is incorporated herein. After a change is made to a controlling source, a change to
     this AFI will be distributed in a timely manner.
     1.2.3. Waiver authority for this publication is the MAJCOM/A3, IAW AFI 11-202V2.
     Waivers will be requested from the parent MAJCOM Stan/Eval through appropriate
     channels. Waiver authority for supplemental guidance will be as specified in the supplement
     and approved through the higher level coordination authority.
1.3. Procedures.
     1.3.1. Flight Examiners (FE) will use the evaluation criteria contained in Table 3.1. or Table
     4.1. as appropriate when conducting all flight and emergency procedure evaluations (EPE).
     1.3.2. FEs should not normally occupy a primary crew position during an evaluation, but
     may do so if acting as a student for an instructor evaluation, mission requirements dictate a
     crew change, or in other situations where doing so is deemed necessary by the evaluator.
     1.3.3. FEs will brief evaluatees on the evaluation purpose, conduct, and specific areas prior
     to flight. Evaluatees will accomplish required flight planning for the evaluation IAW
     requirements for their crew position. Higher headquarters (HHQ) flight examiners (and unit
     flight examiners as determined locally) may assist in mission planning and briefing as tasked
     and will be furnished a copy of all required mission materials upon request.
     1.3.4. FEs will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the flight evaluation. This debrief will
     include the evaluatee's overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than
     qualified) and any required additional training. To the maximum extent possible, evaluations
     will be debriefed with the squadron commander (SQ/CC) or evaluatee’s supervisor.
1.4. Grading Instructions. Standards and performance parameters are contained in AFI 11-
202V2, MAJCOM supplement, this instruction, and the appropriate unit addendum.
AFI11-2RQ-4V2 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                    5


   1.4.1. FEs will compare evaluatee performance for each area accomplished during the
   evaluation with the standards provided and assign an appropriate grade for the area. The
   overall flight evaluation grade is derived from the area grades and is based on a composite of
   the observed events and tasks IAW AFI 11-202V2 and this instruction. If the evaluatee
   receives an unqualified area grade in any of the CRITICAL areas identified in Table 2.1, an
   overall unqualified grade will be assigned.
       1.4.1.1. FEs will use the evaluation criteria in Chapters 3, 4, and 5 of this volume to
       determine individual area grades. FEs must exercise judgment when the wording of areas
       is subjective and when specific situations are not covered. FE judgment is paramount in
       the determination of the overall evaluation grade and all aspects of the flight should be
       considered.
       1.4.1.2. FEs will consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall evaluation
       grade. See Attachment 1 for definitions of the terms deviation, omission, and error and
       how the words minor and major apply to these terms.
   1.4.2. When grading criteria specify evaluation of a specific flight parameter and the flight
   manual lists only a minimum, maximum, or recommended flight parameter for that area, the
   evaluatee should brief the crew if deviation is necessary for any reason.
1.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluation. FEs will use an approved Aircrew Training Device
(ATD), if available, to conduct EPEs. FEs will evaluate in the ATD only those areas that can be
evaluated realistically in simulation. If not using an ATD, or for areas that cannot be evaluated
realistically in simulation, FEs will administer the EPE orally. FEs will use the evaluation
criteria in Chapter 5 to determine individual area grades. This evaluation will include areas
commensurate with evaluatee's Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) training level.
   1.5.1. The following items will be included on all EPEs:
       1.5.1.1. General Knowledge. Evaluate pilots and sensor operators (SO) on general air
       vehicle, ground station, and mission systems knowledge as required by their crew
       position.
       1.5.1.2. Emergency Procedures. Evaluate a minimum of one abnormal or emergency
       procedure per phase of flight (e.g., pre-takeoff, takeoff, cruise, and landing).
           1.5.1.2.1. FEs will evaluate pilot-initiated stop taxi procedure or pilot-initiated abort
           procedures on all pilot qualification (QUAL) EPEs. On Pilot initial (INIT) QUAL
           and requalification (REQUAL) EPEs, these items must be evaluated using the ATD;
           they may be evaluated orally on periodic QUAL evaluations at the discretion of the
           evaluator. Incorrect stop taxi procedure or pilot-initiated abort procedure requires an
           unqualified (Q-3) EPE grade. A pilot who receives a Q-3 as a result of stop taxi or
           pilot-initiated abort procedure error is not permitted to serve in his or her aircrew
           position until a successful reevaluation is accomplished.
           1.5.1.2.2. FEs will limit SO EPEs to general knowledge, checklist procedures, and
           crew coordination. SO emergency procedure responsibilities are limited to assisting
           the pilot in diagnosing the problem, completing necessary tasks, and using available
           aids to resolve the emergency. Do not evaluate SOs on in-depth air vehicle systems
 6                                                     AFI11-2RQ-4V2 30 NOVEMBER 2012


            knowledge related to emergency procedures except for sensor system faults. SOs
            may be evaluated on ground station emergencies.
        1.5.1.3. Contingency Management, Alternates, and Diverts. Evaluate pilots on
        overall contingency management. Include performance evaluation of at least one
        contingency (if using an ATD) and oral evaluation of all contingency modes on each
        EPE. Include performance or oral evaluation of coordination procedures and unique
        characteristics of landing an RQ-4 at alternate or divert airfields.
        1.5.1.4. Crew Coordination. Evaluate crew coordination where applicable.
     1.5.2. Evaluatees may use publications during the EPE that are normally available during a
     flight.
     1.5.3. Evaluatees receiving an overall unqualified grade will be placed in supervised status
     until recommended additional training is completed and/or reevaluation is successfully
     accomplished. On EPEs graded as qualified with additional training, the FE will indicate
     whether the additional training need be accomplished before the next flight. Additional
     training and reevaluations will be accomplished IAW AFI 11-202V2.
     1.5.4. Normally, separate EPEs are required for pilot instrument (INSTM)/QUAL, and
     mission (MSN) evaluations. If an EPE is conducted while the evaluatee is within both the
     INSTM/QUAL and MSN evaluation eligibility windows, a single EPE may be administered
     to fulfill the requisites for the combined INSTM, QUAL, and MSN evaluations. The
     combined EPE must be of sufficient scope and length to ensure all required areas for each
     evaluation are accomplished.
1.6. Documentation of Reconnaissance Employment Results. Document reconnaissance
employment results in the Mission Description Section of the Comments Block on the AF Form
8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
AFI11-2RQ-4V2 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                   7


                                           Chapter 2

                             EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General.
   2.1.1. Evaluation requirements for QUAL and MSN evaluations listed in this chapter are
   generic. Specific areas required for flight evaluations are indicated in Table 2.1. and specific
   areas required for EPEs are indicated in Table 2.2. Prior to the mission, the FE will ensure
   the evaluatee understands which areas will be evaluated. The criteria in Table 3.1, Table
   4.1, and Table 5.1 (as appropriate), will be used to evaluate the mission.
   2.1.2. Evaluation Requirements. Areas in Table 2.1. and Table 2.2. marked with an ―R‖
   are required items for that evaluation. A required area is a specific area that must be
   evaluated to complete the evaluation. All required areas must be included in the flight
   evaluation profile. However, if it is impossible to accomplish a required area in-flight, the
   FE may elect to evaluate the area by an alternate method (e.g. using an ATD or orally) in
   order to complete the evaluation. If the FE determines the required item cannot be
   adequately evaluated by an alternate method, the evaluatee will require an additional flight to
   complete the evaluation.
   2.1.3. Publications Check. FEs will check the following publications:
       2.1.3.1. Electronic Flight Manual (EFM). See Attachment 1 for definition of and
       evaluation procedures for electronic publications.
       2.1.3.2. Local In-flight Guide (when applicable).
       2.1.3.3. Any additional publications issued to aircrews and specified in AFI 11-2RQ-4V3
       or the unit addendum to AFI 11-202V2.
   2.1.4. Combined Evaluations. Combined INSTM, QUAL, and MSN evaluations require
   only one set of ground requisites provided requirements of all evaluations are met.
2.2. Pilot Instrument and Qualification Evaluations. Initial, re-qualification, or periodic RQ-
4 pilot INSTM and QUAL evaluations will be combined into a single INSTM/QUAL evaluation,
and may be accomplished in the Launch and Recovery Element (LRE), the Mission Control
Element (MCE), or in an approved ATD. Evaluations during exercises or deployments are
allowed.
   2.2.1. The following items are requisites for instrument and qualification evaluations:
       2.2.1.1. Qualification Exam (Closed Book)
       2.2.1.2. Qualification Exam (Open Book)
       2.2.1.3. Publications check.
       2.2.1.4. EPE.
       2.2.1.5. Instrument examination
2.3. Mission Evaluations. All RQ-4 crewmembers will successfully complete initial and
periodic MSN evaluations. Initial MSN evaluations must occur after successful completion of
the initial INSTM/QUAL evaluation. Scenarios that represent unit Designed Operational
 8                                                       AFI11-2RQ-4V2 30 NOVEMBER 2012


Capability (DOC) tasking and resemble operational missions satisfy the requirements of this
evaluation. The mission profiles will be designed to evaluate areas commensurate with the
evaluatee’s RAP training level, special qualifications, and basic airmanship. Initial mission
evaluations will be given in the primary DOC of the unit (when possible). Evaluatees will be
evaluated in the position of their highest qualification. Evaluations during exercises or
deployments are allowed.
     2.3.1. For pilots, the initial, requalification, or periodic MSN evaluations will be
     accomplished in the MCE. Units may combine pilot periodic INSTM/QUAL/MSN
     evaluations and accomplish them in the MCE. EQ-4 units may substitute the Beyond Line-
     of-Sight LRE (BLOS LRE) for the MCE on MSN evaluations when flying mid-mission from
     the BLOS LRE.
        2.3.1.1. For pilots assigned to permanent party positions at forward operating locations
        (FOL), periodic MSN evaluations may be accomplished in the LRE, with the evaluation
        tailored to the mission(s) specific to the location. Pilots who complete MSN evaluations
        in the LRE remain mission qualified, but are restricted to LRE operations only. FEs will
        document the restriction in the Comments block of the AF Form 8. A requalification
        MSN evaluation must be accomplished in the MCE to remove the restriction.
     2.3.2. For SOs, the MSN evaluation is a combined QUAL/MSN evaluation accomplished in
     the MCE.
     2.3.3. The following items are requisites for mission evaluations:
        2.3.3.1. Publications check.
        2.3.3.2. EPE.
2.4. Formal Course Evaluations. Syllabus evaluations will be flown IAW syllabus mission
profile guidelines if stated, or on a mission profile developed from syllabus training objectives.
Formal course guidelines may be modified, based on local operating considerations or FE
judgment, to complete the evaluation. Training objectives and related areas will be graded using
the performance criteria in Chapters 3, 4, and 5.
2.5. Instructor Evaluations.
     2.5.1. All crewmembers selected for instructor duty must be evaluated to determine their
     proficiency, judgment, technical knowledge, instructor ability (including error analysis of
     student activity), and use of grading documents.
     2.5.2. Instructors must demonstrate timely, effective and efficient instruction to a student (or
     qualified individual acting as a student). The evaluator may require the evaluatee to present
     verbal explanations of equipment operations, procedures, and techniques. Evaluators must
     exercise sound judgment to ensure oral questions and instructions are clear, concise, pertinent
     to the individual’s crew duties, and do not interfere with normal mission accomplishment.
     The evaluator may forego additional demonstration or instruction based on time available
     and other factors.
     2.5.3. For scheduled instructor evaluations, an evaluator who desires a critique of areas not
     covered in the evaluatee’s prebrief will allow the evaluatee sufficient time to prepare the
     critique. For HHQ Standardization/Evaluation administered evaluations, the evaluator will
AFI11-2RQ-4V2 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                    9


   provide the evaluatee a performance critique as soon as possible following the evaluatee’s
   critique.
   2.5.4. Initial Instructor Evaluations.
       2.5.4.1. Pilots or SOs must demonstrate the ability to instruct in some phase of the unit’s
       mission. Specific profiles and/or events will be determined by the FE, and must include
       any specific requirements delineated under Area 20 in Table 3.1 or Table 4.1, as
       appropriate.
       2.5.4.2. Crewmembers who desire to re-align their INSTM, QUAL, or MSN evaluation
       during the initial INSTR evaluation must complete requisite written examinations,
       publications check, and EPE.
   2.5.5. Periodic Instructor Evaluations. Periodic evaluations (INSTM/QUAL, MSN, and
   QUAL/MSN) will include evaluation of the crewmember’s instructional ability.
   2.5.6. Instructor Evaluation Grading
       2.5.6.1. An instructor receiving an area grade of U in any instructor area will receive an
       overall Q-3 for the Instructor Evaluation. The instructor may not perform instructor
       duties until additional training and/or a successful re-evaluation is complete. This
       restriction is placed in the comments and YES is marked in the ―restrictions‖ block on the
       AF Form 8.
       2.5.6.2. An instructor receiving an area grade of U or Q- with additional training
       required in any grading area will not perform instructor duties until additional training is
       complete. This restriction is placed in the comments and YES is marked in the
       ―restrictions‖ block on the AF Form 8.
       2.5.6.3. If an instructor receives an area grade of Q- in any instructor area, but the flight
       examiner determines additional training is not appropriate or necessary, the overall
       qualification level (e.g. Q-1, Q-2, Q-3) awarded for the Instructor Evaluation resides
       within the flight examiner’s judgment.
2.6. Difference Certifications and Difference Qualification Evaluations. Crewmembers
require difference qualification training and either difference certification or a difference
qualification evaluation to document qualifications in different air vehicle models; in new air
vehicle or ground station systems, software, avionics, sensors/payloads, and displays; or in
operations for which a crewmember had no previous qualification.
   2.6.1. System changes will be classified as minor or major. The operations group
   commander (OG/CC) will determine what constitutes a minor or major system change.
   2.6.2. A minor system change within the same mission design series air vehicle requires a
   difference certification. Difference certification training will be accomplished by a qualified
   instructor and certified by the SQ/CC. Units will document the difference certification on the
   squadron letter of certification (letter of Xs).
   2.6.3. A major system change requires a difference qualification evaluation. A difference
   qualification evaluation does not have an expiration date established because the evaluation
   does not satisfy the requirements for the ―full‖ periodic evaluation. For administrative

                            PILOT EVALUATION CRITERIA

3.1. General.
   3.1.1. The grading criteria in this chapter are divided into three sections: General,
   Instrument, and Mission. Use all sections for criteria applicable to the events performed on
   the evaluation.
   3.1.2. Grade all observed areas. Assign only one grade to each area. Where major areas are
   divided into subareas, grades will be assigned to each subarea for which grading criteria is
   provided. Annotate discrepancies (less than Q performance) IAW AFI 11-202V2 and this
   publication.
   3.1.3. Criteria are intended to ensure objective and standardized evaluations. Evaluators
   must realize these grading criteria cannot cover every situation. Overall performance ratings
   combine in-flight and ground requisite performance tempered by sound evaluator judgment.
3.2. Evaluation Criteria.

1A. Mission Preparation
      Q         Clearly defined the mission overview and mission goals. Provided specific
                information on what needed to be done. Solicited feedback from other
                crewmembers to ensure understanding of mission requirements. Thoroughly
                critiqued plans to identify potential problem areas and ensured all flight
                members understood possible contingencies. Checked all factors applicable to
                flight IAW applicable directives. Adequate knowledge in mission requirements
                including (if applicable) Special Instructions (SPINs), Air Tasking Order
                (ATO), coordination with Liaison Officer and participating ground-based
                mission agencies. Aware of alternatives available if flight cannot be completed
                as planned. Read and initialed all items in the Flight Crew Information File
                (FCIF) and read files. Prepared at briefing time. Able to understand and
                interpret the current mission plan.
     Q-         Did not adequately define the mission overview and mission goals. Did not
                adequately address potential problem areas. Did not adequately solicit feedback
                or critique the plans to ensure understanding of possible contingencies. Minor
                errors or omissions detracted from mission effectiveness, but did not affect
                mission accomplishment. Demonstrated limited knowledge of performance
                capabilities or approved operating procedures and rules in some areas.
      U         Did not define the mission overview and goals. Lack of specific information on

Terms
Aircrew Training Device—-A training device that permits learning, development, and the
practice of skills and procedures necessary for understanding and operating the integrated
systems of a specific prime mission system.
Pilot Stand—Alone Trainer (PSAT): An RQ-4 part-task operator trainer that allows selected
pilot tasks be practiced and a high degree of skill developed independently of the full elements of
RQ-4 ground station operation.
Weapon System Trainer (WST): A training device that dynamically simulates the flight
characteristics of the designated aircraft to train crewmembers in normal cockpit and
flight procedures, emergency procedures, and combat mission execution. Trainer
combines safety—of-flight operation and warfighting tasks, and provides skill integration
training.

regulations. Do not consider performing an action or actions out of sequence due to unusual or
AFI11-2RQ-4V2 30 NOVEMBER 2012                                                                   49


extenuating circumstances a deviation. In some cases, momentary deviations may be acceptable;
however, consider cumulative momentary deviations in determining the overall qualification
level.
Minor: Did not detract from mission accomplishment, adversely affect use of equipment, or
violate safety.
Major: Detracted from mission accomplishment, adversely affected use of equipment, or
violated safety.
Electronic Publications—-Technical orders and publications issued to crewmembers in
electronic media.
Technical Orders: The electronic flight manual (EFM) is an electronic data base that
comprises the RQ—4 Flight Manual, and requires specialized viewing software that is issued
with the data base. All changes to the data base are issued electronically; therefore, evaluation of
the EFM is accomplished by ensuring the individual crewmember has the current EFM loaded on
their viewing device.
Other Publications: RQ—4 crewmembers also may be issued other publications in electronic
(.pdf or .doc) or paper format. Units may specify evaluation of these other publications.
Evaluation of electronic publications is accomplished by ensuring the individual crewmember
has the current publication and changes loaded on their viewing device.
Emergency Procedures Evaluation—-An evaluation of crew general knowledge and
responsiveness to critical and non-critical emergency procedures conducted by a FE in an
approved ATD. An EPE may be administered orally if an appropriate training device is not
available.
Error—-Departure from standard procedures. Performing incorrect actions or recording
incorrect information.
Minor: Did not detract from mission accomplishment, adversely affect use of equipment, or
violate safety.
Major: Detracted from mission accomplishment, adversely affected use of equipment, or violated
safety.
Key Words and Definitions— “Will‖ and ―Shall‖ indicate a mandatory requirement. ―Should‖
is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplishment. ―May‖
indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
Omission—-To leave out a required action or annotation.
Minor: Did not detract from mission accomplishment, adversely affect use of equipment, or
violate safety.
Major: Detracted from mission accomplishment, adversely affected use of equipment, or violated
safety.
