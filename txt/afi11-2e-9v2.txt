                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. All evaluations will be conducted IAW the provisions of AFI 11-202V2 and this
volume.
1.2. Waivers. Waiver authority for this instruction is the MAJCOM A3. Waivers will be
requested from the parent MAJCOM A3 through appropriate Stan/Eval channels.
   1.2.1. Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this AFI under normal
   circumstances, except for safety or when necessary to protect the crew or aircraft from a
   situation not covered by this AFI and immediate action is required. Report deviations or
   exceptions without waiver through channels to MAJCOM standardization/evaluation.
   MAJCOM standardization/evaluation will notify lead command for follow-on action, if
   necessary.
1.3. Procedures:
   1.3.1. Stan Eval Flight Examiners (FE) will use the evaluation criteria contained in Chapter
   3 for conducting all flight and emergency procedure evaluations. To ensure standard and
   objective evaluations, flight examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed
   evaluation criteria.
   1.3.2. The FE may fly in any seat, including the jump seat, that will best enable the FE to
   conduct a thorough evaluation. The FE may fly as a primary crewmember on any evaluation.
   1.3.3. The FE will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and how it will be
   conducted prior to flight. The examinee will accomplish required flight planning in
   accordance with the flight position during the evaluation. Higher Headquarter SEFEs (and
   unit FEs as determined locally) will be furnished a copy of necessary mission data, and
   mission materials.
   1.3.4. Required areas are shown in Table 2.1 When it is impossible to evaluate a required
   area in flight, it will be evaluated by an alternate method in order to complete the evaluation.
   1.3.5. Critical Areas. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the aircrew member
   in order to successfully achieve the mission objectives. If an aircrew member receives an
   unqualified grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will also be
   unqualified. Critical areas are identified by an “*” in the “Notes” column of Table 2.1.
   1.3.6. The FE will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the flight. This debrief will include the
   examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified)
   and any required additional training.
1.4. Grading Instructions. Standards and performance parameters are contained in AFI 11-
202V2 and this volume.
   1.4.1. When in-flight evaluation of a required area is not possible, the area may be verbally
   evaluated or evaluated in an ATD unless otherwise noted in this AFI. Flight examiners will
   make every effort to evaluate all required areas in-flight before resorting to this provision. If
   an alternate method is used to complete the evaluation, document in the Additional
4                                                           AFI11-2E-9V2 7 DECEMBER 2009


     Comments portion of the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification. Use of this
     provision must be approved by the examinee’s commander. The commander’s signature on
     the AF Form 8 acknowledges this provision has been approved.
     1.4.2. The FE will base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a
     stable aircraft. Do not consider momentary deviations from tolerances, provided the
     examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying
     safety. The FE will consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade.
     1.4.3. When grading criteria specify that airspeed be evaluated and the flight manual lists
     only a minimum/ maximum/recommended airspeed for that area, the examinee will brief the
     desired airspeed.
     1.4.4. The FE will compare examinee performance for each area accomplished during the
     evaluation with the standards provided in this volume and assign an appropriate grade for the
     area. Derive the overall flight evaluation grade from the area grades based on a composite for
     the observed events and tasks IAW this volume.
        1.4.4.1. Overall grade will be determined based on this grading volume and SEFE
        judgment.
        1.4.4.2. The following general criteria apply during all phases of flight except as noted
        for specific events and instrument final approaches:

1.5. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). In order of preference, the EPE will be
conducted in a flight simulator/unit training device (UTD), cockpit procedure trainer (CPT), or
verbally. Only conduct a verbal EPE if a flight simulator/UTD or CPT is not available or not
configured appropriately for the evaluation. Grading criteria for each required item are listed in
Chapter 3. This evaluation will include areas commensurate with examinee's Ready Aircrew
Program (RAP) training level and event qualifications.
    1.5.1. The following items will be included on all emergency procedures evaluations:
       1.5.1.1. Aircraft general knowledge.
       1.5.1.2. Emergency procedures. Evaluate a minimum of two emergency procedures per
       phase of flight (i.e., pre-takeoff, takeoff, cruise and landing). All Bold Face will be
       evaluated.
       1.5.1.3. Crew coordination (if applicable).
       1.5.1.4. Unusual attitude recoveries. This also fulfills the Area 16 (Unusual Attitude
       Recoveries) requirement for Pilot Instrument/Qualification evaluations.
    1.5.2. The following additional items will be included on EPEs as a requisite for the
    instrument and/ or qualification evaluation:
       1.5.2.1. AFMAN 11-217, Instrument             Flight   Procedures.     Evaluate      use   of
       standby/emergency instruments.
       1.5.2.2. Alternate/Divert Airfields. Evaluate a minimum of one approach at other than
       home base.
    1.5.3. Examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade will be placed in supervised status
    until recommended additional training is completed and/or a reevaluation is successfully
    accomplished.
    1.5.4. Normally, an EPE will be conducted separately for the pilot Instrument/Qualification
    (INSTM/QUAL) and Mission (MSN) evaluations. In situations where INSTM/QUAL and
    MSN evaluation eligibility zones coincide, a single EPE may be administered to fulfill the
    requisites for the combined MSN/INSTM/QUAL evaluations. The combined EPE must be
    of sufficient scope and length to ensure all required areas for each evaluation are
    accomplished.
    1.5.5. The following grading criteria will be used to grade individual items on EPEs:
       1.5.5.1. Q. Performance is correct. Quickly recognizes and corrects errors.
       1.5.5.2. Q-. Performance is safe, but indicates limited proficiency. Makes errors of
       omission .
       1.5.5.3. U. Performance is unsafe or indicates lack of knowledge or ability.

                                            Chapter 2

                              EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1. General:
    2.1.1. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202V2. Evaluation
    requirements are depicted in Table 2.1
    2.1.2. Areas indicated with an "R" are required items for that evaluation. A required area is
    a specific area that must be evaluated to complete the evaluation. All required areas must be
    included in the flight evaluation profile. However, if it is impossible to accomplish a
    required area in-flight, the FE may elect to evaluate the area(s) by an alternate method (i.e.,
    simulator/Unit Training Device, cockpit procedural trainer (CPT), verbally, etc.), in order to
    complete the evaluation. If the FE determines the required item cannot be adequately
    evaluated by an alternate method, the examinee will require an additional flight to complete
    the evaluation.
2.2. Instrument/Qualification Evaluation. A mission flown according to instrument flight
rules (to the maximum extent practical) best fulfills the objective of the instrument/qualification
evaluation. To the maximum extent possible, this evaluation will include approaches at airfields
other than home or deployed locations. This evaluation may be administered on any compatible
training mission with the approval of the unit commander. Minimum ground phase requisites
are:
    2.2.1. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC) Training (IAW AFMAN 11-210, Instrument
    Refresher Course (IRC) Program).
    2.2.2. Instrument examination.
    2.2.3. Closed and open book qualification examinations.
    2.2.4. EPE.
    2.2.5. Bold Face Written Exam.       Answers must contain all Bold Face items in proper
    sequence.
2.3. Mission Evaluation. Profiles will be designed to evaluate the training/flight
position/special qualifications as well as basic airmanship of the examinee. Initial mission
evaluations will be given on any syllabus mission. Mission evaluations will include examinee
knowledge of operations (mission planning, range patrol, telemetry, Ultra High Frequency
(UHF) relay). Initial Qualification pilots may receive initial mission evaluations after completing
an instrument/qualification evaluation. Recurring mission evaluations will normally be combined
with recurring instrument/ qualification evaluations.
2.4. Instructor Evaluation. Instructor evaluations will be conducted IAW AFI 11-202V2.
Flight evaluations will include a thorough evaluation of the examinee’s instructor knowledge and
ability. Initial instructor evaluations may be conducted on any type of mission. The examinee
will occupy the right seat for the initial evaluation. Recurring evaluations may be performed in
either seat. Except for requirements delineated in Table 2.1., specific profiles and/or events will
be determined by the flight examiner. Subsequent evaluations (for example, Instrument/
Qualification, Mission) will include instructor portions during the evaluations.
