      sortie on targets in the industrial complex, except on designated rotational multiple drop
      targets. On the designated rotational multiple drop targets, multiple passes each sortie are
      authorized, but only one bomb per pass is authorized. Ripple releases on the industrial
      complex are prohibited at all times. There are also numerous no-drop targets within the
      industrial complex. The 366 FW Range Handbook lists the no-drop targets and rotational
      multi-drop targets. Note: Ordnance restrictions on the industrial complex are in-place to
      increase long term target survivability.
      2.6.3.3. SAM sites, East Convoy, Missile Resupply Convoy, and Forward Edge of the
      Battle Area (FEBA) tanks are always multiple-drop targets. Multiple passes and ripple
      deliveries are authorized on these targets at all times. The maximum stick length is 375’.
      As an example, aircrews can ripple 6 bombs with 75’ spacing or 4 bombs with 125’
      spacing. Aircrews requiring to ripple more than 375’ stick length shall submit their
      request to the 366 OSS/OSOR. Requests for stick lengths greater than 375’ will be
      approved on a case-by-case basis after applicable weapon footprint issues are resolved.
   2.6.4. Laser Operations:
      2.6.4.1. Combat and training laser operations are authorized on Juniper Butte Range.
      Laser Safety Surveys which provide a complete list of authorized lasers and restrictions
      can be obtained on the MHRC website or by contacting 366 OSS/OSOR.

      2.6.4.2. Units using ground based lasers must prior coordinate and obtain approval from
      366 OSS/OSOR prior to commencing operations.
      2.6.4.3. Laser Scale Target Scoring System (LSTSS). The LSTSS is a laser radiation
      sensor that determines laser spot position for laser scoring. System provides a laser spot
      position based on the selected target, simulated no-drop bomb score and remote replay
      capability. Weapons scoring operator must input the requested target and PRF code. The
      data file provides location of the laser spot for visual replay by the aircrew during debrief.
      The 366 FW Range Handbook lists the LSTSS desired mean point of impact points.
      LSTSS procedures are listed on the MHRC website or can be obtained by contacting 366
      OSS/OSOR.
   2.6.5. Areas of Critical Concern. Juniper Butte Range contains several areas of critical
   concern including scoring system towers and manned maintenance sites (Table 2.2)
   Aircrews shall mission plan to ensure these locations are not targeted.

  COMPLEX

2.7. No-Drop Sites:
   2.7.1. General. Various No-Drop (ND) target complexes and manned electronic combat
   sites are located within the MHRC. No ordnance is authorized on these sites.
   2.7.2. Laser use. Only training mode laser employment (eye-safe lasers) is permitted on ND
   target and EC sites. Combat laser employment and ground laser operations are prohibited.
   2.7.3. Refer to Attachment 7, MHRC No-Drop and Emitter Sites, are described below:
      2.7.3.1. ND-1 (Tank Farm): 111 tanks and vehicles dispersed in various formations
      located in Jarbidge North MOA. Some targets are heated when requested. Site is
      centered on N42-37.930 W115-45.360.
      2.7.3.2. ND-4: Industrial complex located in Jarbidge West MOA with heated buildings
      (when requested) and storage tanks of various shapes and sizes.
      2.7.3.3. ND-5: Industrial complex located in Jarbidge West MOA with heated buildings
      (when requested) of various sizes and shapes, four simulated petroleum, oils, and
      lubricants (POL) storage tanks.
      2.7.3.4. ND-7: Radar site contains four radar type targets simulating a variety of radar
      types and three control buildings located in Jarbidge South MOA Some targets are
      heated when requested.
AFI13-212_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFB_ADD_A 17 JANUARY 2012                                       23


      2.7.3.5. ND-9 (Grasmere): Missile site contains four 5-rail launchers with simulated
      missiles.
   2.7.4. Manned emitter sites: There are 34 sites located throughout the MHRC.             Site
   designations and locations are identified in Attachment 7.
2.8. Weapons Scoring Systems:
   2.8.1. Weapons Impact Scoring Set (WISS):
      2.8.1.1. Saylor Creek and Juniper Butte Range have WISS installed. WISS provides
      capability to score multiple impact points, day or night. Scores are passed as clock
      positions oriented relative to true north unless user coordinates attack headings with
      weapons scoring operator prior to delivery.
      2.8.1.2. Night scoring. WISS cameras are available for night scoring operations. All
      targets at Saylor Creek Range, except those in the northwest corner, can be night scored.
      Due to camera locations and targets being in close proximity, there are some targets in
      the industrial complex at Juniper Butte Range that cannot be scored at night. The 366
      FW Range Handbook provides a list of night targets that can be scored.
      2.8.1.3. WISS system accuracy is 1 meter. Weather conditions (high winds) and lack of
      coordination by user may adversely affect scoring system accuracy and availability.
   2.8.2. Improved Remote Strafe Scoring System (IRSSS). Saylor Creek Range has IRSSS
   installed on the conventional strafe pits and targets 16/17. On the conventional strafe pits,
   system can score LAS, LRS, and TTS. On target 16/17, the system can score LAS, LRS,
   TTS, and HAS. Although HAS up to 45 is permitted on target 16/17, maximum dive angle
   for accurate HAS scoring is only 30.
2.9. Scoring and Target Support Request Procedures:
   2.9.1. Aircrews desiring weapons scoring, laser scoring, heated targets or lighted targets
   should use Attachment 8, MHRC Coordination Checklist.
   2.9.2. Weapons Scoring Request Procedures:
      2.9.2.1. General. Aircrews desiring weapons scoring on Saylor Creek or Juniper Butte
      Range will notify weapons scoring operations of planned events and targets at least 1-
      hour prior to start of their range period. This will allow setup of scoring cameras on
      selected targets and reduce time required to change cameras during the mission. Failure
      to notify weapons scoring operations of intended targets and planned events may result in
      no scores.
      2.9.2.2. Fax Request. Aircrews should fax their weapons scoring requests to DSN 728-
      8153 using Attachment 8. This is the preferred method.
      2.9.2.3. Phone Request. Aircrews can request weapons scoring by calling DSN 728-
      8152. Aircrews should be prepared to pass call sign, scheduled range and range time,
      number and type of aircraft in flight, home unit, DSN fax numbers, type of events, type
      of ordnance, target # and attack heading, and special requests. After normal duty hours
      call the 24-hour answering service at DSN 728-8152. If unable to contact weapons
      scoring operators, attempt to contact RCO at DSN 728-8195.
24         AFI13-212_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFB_ADD_A 17 JANUARY 2012


     2.9.2.4. Radio Request. Aircrews can pass their request to the weapons scoring operator
     upon entry into Saylor Creek or Juniper Butte Range. During Class A operations on
     Saylor Creek Range, request will be normally passed through RCO on 262.75. During
     Class B operations on Saylor Creek Range, request will be passed to the weapons scoring
     operator on 262.75 (Callsign – "Weapons Scoring"). Requests over the radio for Juniper
     Butte Range weapons scoring will be passed directly to weapons scoring operator on
     392.2 (backup-262.75).
     2.9.2.5. During Class A operations, scores will normally be passed by the RCO to the
     flight over the radio. During Class B operations, the weapons scoring operator will only
     pass scores over the radio if requested. After completion of mission, the weapons scoring
     operators will fax a summary of scores to the local squadron’s primary fax number. Off-
     station users can request scores be faxed by calling weapons scoring (DSN 728-8152)
     after landing, or by request via UHF prior to departing range.
     2.9.2.6. Scores will normally be passed to aircraft in meters and clock position relative to
     magnetic run-in heading. If flight leads fail to coordinate attack axis with RCO or
     weapons scoring operator, score clock position will be relative to true north (12 o'clock is
     true north/344º magnetic). Impacts less than 5 meters are scored as a "Shack."
  2.9.3. Laser Scoring Request Procedures. Laser spot scoring is available with the LSTSS
  at Juniper Butte Range. Aircrews should fax their laser scoring request to weapons scoring
  operator (DSN 728-8153) using Attachment 8. Laser scoring requests at least 1-hour prior
  to start of range time. Submit laser scoring request can also be passed via telephone. Laser
  scoring request can be taken over the radio, but due to time of setting up LSTSS, aircrews
  should expect a delay. Users must download and install LSTSS Remote display program to
  use the LSTSS data file. Network administrator rights are not required to install the program
  and run it on the computer. Weapon system operator will e-mail or download to a central
  directory the LSTSS file so users can see the laser spot location. Scoring accuracy is one to
  five meters depending on target selected. Reference the 366 FW Range Handbook for
  additional information.
  2.9.4. Heated Target Request Procedures:
     2.9.4.1. A small number of targets on Saylor Creek Range can be heated by propane
     heaters for periods of up to approximately 6 hours. Aircrews should fax their heated
     target request to weapons scoring operator (DSN 728-8153) using Attachment 8.
     Heated target request for day missions, must be submitted by 1700L, day prior to the
     mission. Submit Heated target requests for night missions by 1500L the day of the
     mission.
     2.9.4.2. Heated targets at Juniper Butte Range are continuously heated and a request does
     not need to be submitted to use those heated targets.
     2.9.4.3. ND-1, 4, 5, and 7 have heated targets. Submit requests to heat these targets to
     366 OSS/OSOR (Fax: DSN 728-4663) at least 1-week prior to mission. Due to cost, no-
     drop targets are normally only heated for special training requests or wing exercises.
     2.9.4.4. Reference 366 FW Range Handbook for list of heated targets.
AFI13-212_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFB_ADD_A 17 JANUARY 2012                                        25


  2.9.5. Lighted Target Request Procedures. A small number of targets at Saylor Creek
  Range can be lighted at night with propane lanterns. Reference 366 FW Range Handbook for
  a list of lighted targets. Requested targets are lighted at sunset and will remain continuously
  lit throughout the evening for approximately 6 hours. Aircrews should fax their lighted
  target request to weapons scoring operator (DSN 728-8153) using MHRC Coordination
  Checklist by 1500L, day of the mission.

                                           Chapter 3

                                     AIR OPERATIONS

3.1. General. This chapter establishes air operating procedures and restrictions applicable to
MHRC training airspace and ranges. In conjunction with complementary references cited
within, this supplement prescribes standard operational procedures to be used by all aircraft and
support agencies. Aircrews are required to conduct live air-to-ground weapons delivery and air-
to-air training IAW aircraft specific manuals and local instructions. See 366 FW Range
Handbook and AFI 13-201/MHAFB Sup, for additional airspace and target descriptions.
3.2. Mission Planning:
   3.2.1. MHRC first-time operations:
       3.2.1.1. Prior to first-time operations in MHRC airspace, aircrews shall familiarize
       themselves with range boundaries, target locations and manned sites on the range.
       3.2.1.2. All aircrews and JTACs shall review this addendum, AFI 13-201/MHAFB Sup,
       Airspace Management, and the 366 FW Range Handbook. Aircrews operating from
       MHAFB shall be familiar with the procedures listed in MHAFBI 11-250 (FOUO),
       Airfield Operations and Base Flying Procedures. 366 OG/OGV (Stan/Eval) can provide
       a local area briefing if requested.
       3.2.1.3. Aircrews who have not flown on Saylor Creek or Juniper Butte Range for more
       than 1-year, shall accomplish a dry familiarization pass on each range prior to actual
       weapons delivery on that range.
   3.2.2. Aircrews shall mission plan to ensure the Areas of Critical Concern listed in Chapter 2
   of this addendum are not targeted.
   3.2.3. Prior to first release when carrying expendable ordnance, final switch configuration
   for weapon release shall not be accomplished until aircraft is in such a position that any
   accidental release will be contained within the impact area of the ranges. Subsequent switch
   changes can be accomplished outside the impact area.
   3.2.4. Ordnance delivery through Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) is authorized
   for aircraft dropping GPS Guided Ordnance at Saylor Creek Range. Bomber type aircraft
   (B-1, B-52) are authorized to drop unguided weapons through IMC on the northern most
   Saylor Creek Range targets as designated in the 366 FW Range Handbook. No other IMC
   deliveries are authorized on Saylor Creek or Juniper Butte Range. The ROA is the waiver
   authority to this restriction. An operational risk assessment should be accomplished prior to
   waiver approval.
   3.2.5. To the maximum extent possible, aircrews should submit their weapon scoring request
   prior to takeoff. Providing your scoring request while airborne may result in mission delays.
3.3. Airspace Procedures:
   3.3.1. Cowboy Control is designated as the MRU for the MHRC. For the purpose of this
   addendum, the term "airspace control agency" refers to the MRU or RAPCON.
AFI13-212_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFB_ADD_A 17 JANUARY 2012                                        27


     3.3.1.1. When Cowboy Control is not operational, MHAFB RAPCON may activate and
     deactivate the MHRC. When RAPCON is acting in this capacity, autonomous MHRC
     operations are in effect. RAPCON will not maintain positive control of the MHRC, but
     will track flight entry/exit and serve as the coordinating agency with Salt Lake Center.
     3.3.1.2. When Cowboy Control and RAPCON are both not operational, aircrews shall
     activate and deactivate MHRC through Salt Lake Center. When individual aircrews
     activate and deactivate the airspace, responsibility for the Air Traffic Control (ATC)
     released airspace will lie with the aircraft that scheduled and are flying within the
     MOA/ATCAA. These aircraft shall comply with autonomous operations for ATC
     purposes while flying in the MOA/ATCAA.
     3.3.1.3. Hardrock (726 ACS) or AWACS may also serve as the stand-in parent MRU for
     Cowboy Control. This shall only occur after advance coordination with Salt Lake Center
     and RAPCON.
     3.3.1.4. RCO is not authorized to activate airspace at any time.
  3.3.2. When Cowboy Control is the MHRC airspace control agency, Cowboy Control will:
     3.3.2.1. Serve as the primary contact for release and recall of airspace with ARTCC, with
     the exception of X-Ray extension, which is handled by RAPCON. Act as coordinating
     agency for real-time airspace issues.
     3.3.2.2. Clear aircraft in and out of the MHRC airspace. Ensure confirmation of
     assigned airspace, altitude blocks(s), and KMUO altimeter with aircraft upon initial
     contact and airspace entry. Monitor primary range and airspace frequencies for check-in,
     operations and checkout.
     3.3.2.3. Make airspace boundary calls (vertical/lateral) to aircraft. Make informative "5
     mile" call to aircraft when they are within 5 NM of the external airspace boundary. Make
     a directive "2.5 mile" call to aircraft when they are within 2.5 NM of the external airspace
     boundary.
     3.3.2.4. Provide radar traffic advisory service to military aircraft within MHRC to assist
     in avoiding observed nonparticipating traffic.
     3.3.2.5. Assist in maintaining separation of aircraft in MHRC.
     3.3.2.6. Provide traffic advisories on VHF frequency 134.1 to civilian aircraft transiting
     the MOAs.
     3.3.2.7. Notify military aircraft of special range restrictions. These include weapon
     delivery, laser, fire category and fire fighting restrictions.
     3.3.2.8. Notify military aircraft when JTACs or maintenance personnel are on range and
     their specific location if known (Class B/C operations only).
     3.3.2.9. Track which aircraft are within restricted areas to include who has Flight Lead
     Control and when they depart the area. Advise other requested users when there are
     aircraft already operating within the ranges and call sign of aircraft that has Flight Lead
     Control (Class B/C operations only).
28         AFI13-212_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFB_ADD_A 17 JANUARY 2012


     3.3.2.10. Record expenditure of weapons when required and forward information to
     RCO or weapons scoring operators the next day (Class B/C range operations only).
  3.3.3. When RAPCON is the MHRC airspace control agency, RAPCON will:
     3.3.3.1. Activate and de-activate MHRC to include restricted areas and MOAs. Act as
     the coordinating agency for real-time airspace issues.
     3.3.3.2. Clear aircraft in and out of MHRC. Ensure confirmation of activated airspace,
     altitude blocks(s), and KMUO altimeter with aircraft upon initial contact and airspace
     entry. Monitor departure frequency (371.85) for entry requests into airspace and
     approach frequency (259.1) for airspace exit requests. Monitor Jarbidge North/R-3202
     frequency (262.75), but pass no traffic advisories.
     3.3.3.3. Notify military aircraft of special range restrictions. These include weapon
     delivery, laser, fire category and fire fighting restrictions.
     3.3.3.4. Notify military aircraft when JTACs or maintenance personnel are on range and
     their specific location if known (Class B/C range operations only).
  3.3.4. Aircraft transitioning directly from RAPCON's airspace (Area X-Ray) to MHRC shall
  be on a local stereo or IFR flight plan.
  3.3.5. Aircraft operating in MHRC training airspace shall be on an IFR flight plan unless
  mission dictates otherwise. Discrete Codes 0100-0177 have been allocated to Cowboy
  Control by Salt Lake Center for use by aircraft operating within the MHRC. All aircraft shall
  squawk assigned discrete Mode III code and Mode C upon range entry and remain on this
  code while in the airspace, unless otherwise directed by MHRC airspace control agency.
  3.3.6. All aircraft operating in the MHRC shall utilize the MHAFB (KMUO) local altimeter.
  3.3.7. Military Assumes Responsibility For Separation (MARSA) and "see and avoid"
  procedures shall be in effect between participating aircraft/flights operating within entire
  MHRC, and remain in effect until standard ATC separation has been established after exiting
  the MHRC.
  3.3.8. MHRC transition. After participating aircraft have entered the MHRC, they may
  transition between adjacent areas, provided they have been specifically cleared by the
  airspace control agency or its designated representative.
  3.3.9. When the MHAFB RAPCON radar is out of service, aircraft inside the MHRC shall
  remain outside MUO 18 DME arc. Airspace control agency will advise aircraft when radar
  is out of service.
  3.3.10. Airspace Violation. In the event an unauthorized aircraft violates R-3202 or R-3204
  airspace Cowboy Control shall:
     3.3.10.1. For R-3202, time permitting, advise RCO of the intruding aircraft and if it
     appears that holding is necessary to avoid the intruder. For R3204, notify aircraft of the
     intruder.
     3.3.10.2. Do not have aircraft attempt to intercept intruder.
AFI13-212_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFB_ADD_A 17 JANUARY 2012                                            29


      3.3.10.3. Attempt contact with intruder on frequency 243.0 or 121.5 and direct aircraft
      out of restricted area. If appropriate, contact ATC for assistance in determining
      identification of aircraft.
      3.3.10.4. Attempt to obtain intruding aircraft's call sign/tail number, type aircraft and
      destination. Forward this information to 366 OSS/OSOA along with date and time of
      intrusion.
   3.3.11. During R-3202 Class A operations, Cowboy Control will pass traffic advisories to
   aircraft in R-3202 through the RCO. Unless there is an immediate safety of flight issue,
   Cowboy Control will not transmit on 262.75 without RCO’s approval.
3.4. Airspace Entry Procedures:
   3.4.1. MHRC Entry. Aircraft shall enter MHRC via WHISKEY or ELK at 15,000’-16,000’
   MSL, unless otherwise coordinated and approved by airspace control agency.
      3.4.1.1. On initial check-in with the airspace control agency, aircrew shall provide
      position, requested airspace, intentions and working frequency.
      3.4.1.2. Unless coordinated with Cowboy Control and approved by ATC, aircraft shall
      maintain last ATC assigned altitude and route of flight until entering MHRC.
      3.4.1.3. Aircraft may enter via HAWWG at 12,000’-13,000’ MSL if coordinated and
      approved by the airspace control agency.
   3.4.2. Aircraft entering MHRC from an instrument or visual route shall obtain clearance
   from the airspace control agency prior to entering MHRC. When RAPCON is acting as the
   airspace control agency, due to poor low-altitude communication, flights should obtain
   clearance into the MHRC prior to route entry.
   3.4.3. RAPCON operations as airspace control agency:
      3.4.3.1. When RAPCON is acting as the airspace control agency, clear aircraft into all
      activated airspace. [e.g., (Callsign), maintain assigned altitude until entering Mountain
      Home Range Complex, cleared (MHRC activated airspace) at or below flight level
      (released attitudes)] Do not clear aircraft into a specific MOA or restricted area.
      3.4.3.2. Aircraft entering specific areas will switch to appropriate area frequency and
      make an entry call to ensure the airspace is clear or coordinate with aircraft already
      established in the airspace. [e.g., "(Callsign), flight of four, entering Jarbidge South and
      R-3204, for the next 30 minutes, working FLXXX and below).]
      3.4.3.3. RAPCON will NOT provide the following services – track aircraft in specific
      airspace, track who has flight lead control, provide informative or directive boundary
      calls, assist in maintaining separation of military aircraft, provide traffic information to
      avoid civilian aircraft, or provide traffic advisories to civilian aircraft transiting the MOA.
      Autonomous operations are in affect.
   3.4.4. R-3202 Entry:
      3.4.4.1. Advise airspace control agency of intent to use Jarbidge North MOA and R-3202
      on initial check-in. Clearance into Jarbidge North MOA is not automatic clearance into
      R-3202. Specific clearance from the RCO (Class A Operations) or Cowboy Control
 30         AFI13-212_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFB_ADD_A 17 JANUARY 2012


      (Class B/C Operations) is required to enter R-3202. (Note: When R-3202 is Class B/C
      Operations and RAPCON is airspace control agency, flights are cleared into all activated
      airspace.) Flights working R-3202 shall monitor 262.75.
      3.4.4.2. R-3202 Class A operations:
          3.4.4.2.1. Advise RCO if inbound or holding for R-3202 entry. If not cleared or no
          contact with the RCO, hold outside R-3202 within the Jarbidge North MOA
          boundaries until cleared into R-3202. RCO will advise aircraft entering holding of
          other aircraft known to be operating in R-3202.
          3.4.4.2.2. Aircrew shall advise RCO of entry direction, number in flight and specific
          support request (e.g., weapons scoring, fight lead control, etc). Flight lead shall
          acknowledge current altimeter. Aircraft may enter range from any direction,
          providing target run-in headings are followed.
      3.4.4.3. R-3202 Class B/C operations. Cowboy Control will pass Flight Lead Control to
      on-scene command aircraft or request inbound flights coordinate with the Flight Lead
      Control aircraft already established in the airspace. RAPCON clears aircraft into all
      activated airspace and aircraft are required to make an entry call prior to entry.
   3.4.5. R-3204 Entry:
      3.4.5.1. Advise airspace control agency of the intent to use Jarbidge South MOA and R-
      3204 on initial check-in. Clearance into Jarbidge South MOA is not automatic clearance
      in R-3204. Specific clearance from Cowboy Control is required to enter into R-3204.
      (Note: When R-3204 is Class B/C Operations and RAPCON is airspace control agency,
      flights are cleared into all activated airspace.) Flights working R-3204 shall monitor
      392.2.
      3.4.5.2. Cowboy Control will pass Flight Lead Control to on-scene command aircraft or
      request inbound flights coordinate with the flight the Flight Lead Control aircraft already
      established in the airspace. RAPCON clears aircraft into all activated airspace and
      aircraft are required to make an entry call.
3.5. Airspace Exit Procedures:
   3.5.1. Aircraft departing MHRC with destination other than MHAFB shall coordinate their
   departure request with the airspace control agency at least 5 minutes prior to departing
   assigned airspace. Failure to provide departure request 5 minutes prior may result in a delay
   in receiving departure clearance. Include call sign, destination, direction of flight, and
   location aircraft will exit the MHRC.
   3.5.2. Primary MHRC airspace exit point for VFR and IFR aircraft is COYOTE, however,
   aircraft may also exit through WHISKEY, ELK, or HAWWG provided it is coordinated and
   approved by airspace control agency. Exit COYOTE at 13,000’-14,000’ MSL, unless
   otherwise approved by airspace control agency.
      3.5.2.1. VFR aircraft exiting via COYOTE should follow appropriate VFR recovery
      procedure (Lake or Bend). Aircraft desiring to depart airspace VFR from a nonstandard
      departure point will cancel with airspace control agency prior to departing the airspace
      with intentions
AFI13-212_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFB_ADD_A 17 JANUARY 2012                                        31


      3.5.2.2. Exit WHISKEY or ELK at 13,000’-14,000’MSL unless otherwise coordinated
      and approved by airspace control agency.
      3.5.2.3. Exit HAWWG at 10,000’-11,000’ MSL unless otherwise coordinated and
      approved by airspace control agency.
   3.5.3. Flights may elect to exit MHRC airspace from Indian Cove (VFR Only) based on
   airspace and traffic considerations. This is normally used when departing R-3202 VFR.
   3.5.4. R-3202 Departure:
      3.5.4.1. Prior to range departure, inform RCO (Class A operations) or airspace control
      agency (Class B/C operations) of recovery intentions. Flights will not depart range until
      RCO has coordinated with airspace control agency and has given them clearance to
      change frequency and depart the range. If exiting MHRC, monitor Airport Terminal
      Information Service (ATIS) on 273.5 prior to contacting airspace control agency.
      3.5.4.2. Aircraft departing R-3202 IFR will normally exit via ELK. Contact airspace
      control agency for recovery to MHAFB.
      3.5.4.3. Aircraft departing R-3202 VFR direct to MHAFB have the option to depart via
      Indian Cove Recovery. Request "Indian Cove Recovery" from RCO (Class A
      operations) or airspace control agency (Class B/C operations) and monitor ATIS prior to
      exiting range. Following approval from RCO or airspace control agency, depart range
      VFR to the north and cross Indian Cove at or above 5,700 feet MSL, then contact tower
      on 253.5. Advise tower you are "Indian Cove Recovery," with appropriate ATIS and
      intentions.
      3.5.4.4. Aircraft shall avoid directly exiting R-3202 airspace VFR to the north, unless
      flying the Indian Cove departure. A heavily traveled airway passes just north of the
      range and should be avoided.
      3.5.4.5. Aircraft departing R-3202 VFR to the south, west, or east will ensure they have
      received prior transition approval from airspace control agency or contact them prior to
      departing R-3202 or Jarbidge North MOA.
   3.5.5. R-3204 Departure. Flights departing R-3204 will normally fly north to ELK along
   W115-47 line and remain clear of R-3202. "See and Avoid" or radar traffic advisories
   provided by Cowboy Control shall be used for deconfliction during transition to exit point. If
   an IMC departure is required, contact airspace control agency prior to exiting Jarbidge South
   MOA.
   3.5.6. When RAPCON is acting as the airspace control agency, aircraft will contact
   approach on local Channel 7 (259.1) for recovery.
3.6. R-3202/Saylor Creek Range Class A Procedures (RCO Present):
   3.6.1. General Procedures:
      3.6.1.1. RCO is responsible for all range operations and ground safety within the Saylor
      Creek Range and air operations in R-3202 below FL 180. RCO has the authority to
      disapprove or terminate any activity, event, or weapons delivery that creates an unsafe
      condition or could potentially create an unsafe condition.
32        AFI13-212_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFB_ADD_A 17 JANUARY 2012


     3.6.1.2. RCO will coordinate range opening with airspace control agency and be on duty
     30 minutes prior to the first scheduled range period of the day.
     3.6.1.3. Simulated attacks will not be made on any manned sites or personnel without
     approval of RCO. Aircraft will not directly overfly manned sites at any time including
     simulated weapons delivery.
     3.6.1.4. Standard minimum altitudes. Standard minimum altitudes are IAW multi-
     command instructions and local directives.
     3.6.1.5. Conventional delivery operations are limited to a maximum of four aircraft
     within R-3202 at any one time. Multiple flights are authorized if coordinated and
     approved by RCO. RCO may split the range in any manner to maximize range usage.
     RCOs should avoid assigning hard altitudes to aircraft and instead assign altitude blocks.
     (e.g., Departing flight has 11,000’ MSL and above, and entering flight has 10,000’ MSL
     and below).
     3.6.1.6. Tactical delivery operations are limited to a maximum of four attacking aircraft
     and a Forward Air Controller (Airborne) [FAC(A)]. Additional aircraft may be holding
     in the area. Multiple flights are allowed on range if prior coordinated and approved by
     RCO. Tactical delivery operations are normally done under Flight Lead Control. The
     RCO, on-scene command flight lead, FAC(A), and JTAC will ensure positive
     geographical or altitude deconfliction among flights.
  3.6.2. Weapons Release Authority:
     3.6.2.1. Weapons release approval from RCO is required before expending ordnance on
     target impact area. All RCO instructions will be acknowledged. RCO must visually
     acquire aircraft prior to weapons release unless flight is operating under JTAC or flight
     lead control. If the RCO cannot positively determine that the aircraft can release safely,
     RCO will delegate weapons release authority to the individual pilot, flight lead, FAC(A)
     or JTAC.
     3.6.2.2. RCO may delegate weapons release authority. However, as long as RCO is
     present on range, the service provided remains Class A and RCO maintains overall
     authority on the range. Delegation of weapons release authority is not the equivalent of
     Class B/C operations.
     3.6.2.3. When RCO delegate’s weapons release authority to a flight lead, individual
     pilot, FAC(A), JTAC or other briefed person, RCO maintains overall authority on the
     range and can deny release clearance or abort the release at any time. If flight lead,
     individual pilot, FAC(A), JTAC or other briefed person accepts delegation of weapons
     release authority from RCO, they are solely responsible for safe release of ordnance until
     the RCO takes back weapon release authority.
     3.6.2.4. RCO may delegate weapons release authority to the individual pilot, flight lead
     or FAC(A) by authorizing “Flight Lead Control.” RCO will delegate weapons release
     authority to JTACs by authorizing "Weapons Release Authority." When RCO takes back
     weapons release authority, he will do so by stating "RCO has weapons clearance
     authority." All aircrew and JTACs will acknowledge delegations of weapons release
     authority on 262.75.
AFI13-212_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFB_ADD_A 17 JANUARY 2012                                        33


     3.6.2.5. When weapons release authority is delegated, RCO must maintain continuous
     radio communication with all aircraft on the range to ensure each aircraft is properly
     cleared.
  3.6.3. Fouls:
     3.6.3.1. Declaring Fouls. In addition to the foul criteria listed in AFI 11-214, fouls will
     be charged for the following reasons:
         3.6.3.1.1. Entering range without clearance.
         3.6.3.1.2. Failure to comply with ordnance or weapon delivery restrictions listed in
         the 366 FW Range Handbook.
         3.6.3.1.3. Flares that nearly impact the ground or impact the ground while still
         burning.
         3.6.3.1.4. Any situation the RCO perceives as dangerous or unsafe.
     3.6.3.2. After a second foul during any one mission, RCO will direct aircrew to hold
     high and dry or leave the range. An aircraft "fouled off" range will not be permitted
     further attacks on that mission. RCO can also order aircraft to leave range after the first
     foul if, in the RCO's judgment, foul is considered dangerous or extreme. RCO will notify
     366 OSS/OSOR when a crew is "fouled off" range, who will then notify 366 OSS/CC.
  3.6.4. Radio Procedures:
     3.6.4.1. RCO control tower is equipped with two UHF/VHF radios. Primary radio is
     operated on UHF 262.75. RCO secondary radio is normally set at 142.025.
     3.6.4.2. On initial check-in with RCO, flights will state: flight size, request for RCO
     Control or Flight Lead Control, and if they intend to use combat lasers. (e.g., "Saylor
     RCO, Gunfighter 21, flight of four, three miles west, request on range, flight lead control,
     combat lasers") RCO will provide altimeter, significant weather conditions, and
     range/traffic information.
     3.6.4.3. Subsequent radio calls should include requested targets, sequence of events, and
     type of weapon deliveries.
     3.6.4.4. During RCO control (RCO has weapons release authority), aircraft radio calls
     will be IAW AFI 11-214. RCO will clear all ordnance expenditures. If for any reason
     RCO cannot clear an aircraft "HOT," RCO may call "CONTINUE" or "CONTINUE
     DRY." If RCO has any safety concerns, they will withhold clearance to drop and require
     aircraft to go through dry.
     3.6.4.5. When RCO has delegated weapons release authority (flight lead, individual
     pilot, or JTAC control), aircraft will call in HOT or DRY during weapons delivery. If
     intent was to release, but no weapon was released, pilot will call "OFF DRY."
     3.6.4.6. Range Radio Failure. If aircraft loses contact with RCO, immediately cease all
     weapon deliveries until contact is re-established. If unable to re-establish contact with
     RCO, contact airspace control agency. RCO will immediately notify airspace control
     agency if range radio failure occurs. In the event RCO’s radios fail, airspace control
 34         AFI13-212_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFB_ADD_A 17 JANUARY 2012


      agency will take back the airspace and aircraft can continue mission using Class B/C
      operations procedures.
   3.6.5. Armament Safety Checks. Flights will ensure armament safety checks are
   completed prior to departing R-3202.
      3.6.5.1. During Class A Operations, aircrew will add, "last pass" to their last base call.
      After completing armament safety check, the flight lead or each flight member will pass
      “Switches Safe" to the RCO prior to departing range.
      3.6.5.2. If a planned weapons delivery impact is not observed during a bombing pass,
      weapons release can be confirmed visually by a chase aircraft or RCO. RCO bomb
      checks will be flown at a minimum of 500 ft AGL and heading south to north over the
      strafe target.
3.7. Uncontrolled Range Procedures (Class B/C - No RCO):
   3.7.1. Juniper Butte Range is a Class B/C range at all times.
   3.7.2. Saylor Creek Range is a Class B/C range when RCO is not on duty.
      3.7.2.1. There is normally no RCO on duty at Saylor Creek Range for night operations
      (30 minutes after sunset to 30 minutes prior to sunrise), and outside of 12-hour contractor
      scheduled range periods. If an RCO is on duty at night, only Flight Lead Control is
      authorized.
      3.7.2.2. Class B/C operations will be in effect if RCO loses radio communications.
   3.7.3. Large Force Exercises (LFE).
      3.7.3.1. It is recommended to schedule Saylor Creek Range as Class B/C range for LFE.
      This eliminates aircraft having to check-in with RCO.
      3.7.3.2. When Saylor Creek Range is scheduled as Class B/C range during LFE, RCO
      will clear range target area so participating aircraft in LFE will not have to conduct a dry
      clearing pass prior to actual weapons expenditures. LFE mission commander will
      coordinate with 366 OSS/OSOR and Cowboy Control at least 24-hours prior to LFE.
      RCO will notify airspace control agency that range is clear 30 minutes prior to start of
      LFE range period.
      3.7.3.3. Cowboy Control will pass Flight Lead Control to the mission commander or
      their designated representative, who is responsible for ensuring deconfliction within the
      airspace.
      3.7.3.4. When Saylor Creek Range is scheduled as Class B/C range, mission
      commanders may use 262.75 as common LFE frequency. If Saylor Creek Range is
      scheduled as Class A range, 262.75 will not be used as common LFE frequency since
      RCO must control on 262.75.
   3.7.4. Weapons Release Authority:
      3.7.4.1. Flight lead, individual pilot, FAC(A), or JTAC is responsible for safe release of
      ordnance.
AFI13-212_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFB_ADD_A 17 JANUARY 2012                                          35


       3.7.4.2. Prior to weapons delivery, aircrew will confirm the target area is clear of
       unauthorized personnel and equipment. RCO, FAC(A), JTAC, departing flights, or other
       aircraft using the range are authorized sources to ensure the range is clear. If target area
       cannot be confirmed cleared, aircraft will make a dry clearing pass prior to expending
       ordnance.
   3.7.5. Radio Procedures:
       3.7.5.1. Flights planning combat laser operations will notify Cowboy Control during
       initial check-in and request for airspace.
       3.7.5.2. Have Quick (HQ) and/or secure radio operations on R-3202 and R-3204 during
       Class B/C operations are permitted if flights can monitor airspace primary frequency
       using an alternate radio. During HQ operations, flights will monitor 262.75 (R-3202) or
       392.2 (R-3204) in the clear at all times.
           3.7.5.2.1. Aircraft that do not have an alternate UHF radio, may request Cowboy
           Control to monitor an intra-flight VHF frequency. In the event Cowboy Control is
           unable to monitor an intra-flight VHF frequency, flights shall monitor 262.75 (R-
           3202) or 392.2 (R-3204) as appropriate, in the clear or HQ/secure operations are not
           authorized. Cowboy Control may support this option sometimes depending on
           configuration of their radios and other factors.
3.7.6. Armament Safety Checks. Flights will ensure armament safety checks are completed
prior to departing R-3202 or R-3204. Flight lead or each flight member will pass “switches safe”
to airspace controlling agency prior to departing range.
3.8. Weapon Delivery Procedures and Restrictions:
   3.8.1. General:
       3.8.1.1. All weapon deliveries will be IAW with the ordnance, weapon delivery and run-
       in restrictions listed in 366 FW Range Handbook. The most current copy of the 366 FW
       Range Handbook can be downloaded from the MHRC CoP. FCIF will notify local units
       of any changes to the 366 FW Range Handbook.
       3.8.1.2. Aircrews are responsible for staying within assigned airspace to accomplish
       holding or weapons delivery patterns.
       3.8.1.3. Units wanting to employ ordnance not identified in this addendum or 366 FW
       Range Handbook will coordinate with 366 OSO/OSOR. An AF Form 813 is required to
       be submitted. 366 OSS/OSOR will coordinate with 366 CES/CEAN, 366 CES/CED, and
       366 FW/SEW. Final approval authority is the ROA prior to expenditure. Coordination
       for employment of ordnance not identified herein may require 90 days or more advance
       notice due to determination of safety footprint and/or other employment factors.
       Approval is not guaranteed.
       3.8.1.4. Maximum release altitude for deliveries on Saylor Creek or Juniper Butte Range
       is IAW the weapon safety footprint delivery parameters listed in the 366 FW Range
       Handbook.
       3.8.1.5. Munitions expended on Saylor Creek or Juniper Butte Range must be reported.
       RCO or weapons scoring personnel will automatically record expenditures if weapons
36        AFI13-212_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFB_ADD_A 17 JANUARY 2012


     scoring is taking place. If no scoring is requested and ordnance is released, during
     departure aircrew will report on range frequency to the weapons scoring operator
     (primary) or Cowboy Control (secondary) the type and quantity of munitions expended
     and targets expended on.
  3.8.2. Weapon Delivery Terms:
     3.8.2.1. Conventional Delivery. The term "conventional delivery" refers to strafe,
     diving, pop-up, level and loft bombing deliveries from a standard box delivery pattern.
     3.8.2.2. Tactical Delivery. The term "tactical delivery" refers to strafe, diving, pop-up,
     level and loft bombing deliveries from a nonstandard pattern or deliveries with
     nonstandard timing, such as simultaneous deliveries. Tactical deliveries are usually
     flown under Flight Lead Control, because RCO may not be able to acquire aircraft in a
     timely manner to provide clearance release authority.
  3.8.3. Saylor Creek Range:
     3.8.3.1. Weapon Deliveries:
        3.8.3.1.1. Conventional deliveries, either right-hand or left-hand, are approved on all
        range targets that are authorized for bombs. Standard conventional run-in heading is
        344. Aircrews will not overfly manned sites. Aircrews will comply with the
        ordnance, weapon delivery and run-in restrictions identified in 366 FW Range
        Handbook.
        3.8.3.1.2. Tactical deliveries are authorized on all range targets, except conventional
        strafe pits. Aircrews will not overfly manned sites and will comply with the
        ordnance, weapons delivery and run-in restrictions identified in the 366 FW Range
        Handbook.
        3.8.3.1.3. Aircrews are authorized to drop ordnance at night if the main complex
        strobe light is inoperative; however, target will be positively identified by reliable on-
        board systems prior to weapons release.
        3.8.3.1.4. Multiple passes and ripple deliveries are authorized on all targets for which
        ordnance expenditure is authorized. Maximum ripple delivery stick length is 150’.
     3.8.3.2. General Strafe Procedures:
        3.8.3.2.1. Do not position aircraft in any way to point a hot gun at any radar, tower,
        facility, moving vehicle or manned site.
        3.8.3.2.2. Target confirmation is imperative for hot passes. Strafe targets and
        delivery parameters are designed to keep strafe fan within the confines of impact area
        and clear of manned sites. Strictly adhere to run-in headings.
        3.8.3.2.3. Aircrews experiencing malfunctioning guns will begin a shallow climbing
        right turn toward the southeastern corner of restricted area. Avoid pointing guns at
        manned sites and populated areas.
AFI13-212_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFB_ADD_A 17 JANUARY 2012                                         37


    3.8.3.3. Conventional Strafe Pits:
       3.8.3.3.1. Conventional delivery only is authorized. Aircraft pattern will be "right
       range, left traffic." Run-in heading is 344 magnetic. Random run-in headings are not
       authorized.
       3.8.3.3.2. West Strafe Pit is designated as "Pit 1." East Strafe Pit is designated as
       "Pit 2." When requesting clearance, aircraft will designate what pit they are strafing
       on. (e.g., "Hawg 1 is in hot, Pit 1") Due to scoring system limitations, failure to call
       "Pit 1" or "Pit 2" may result in no score.
       3.8.3.3.3. LAS, LRS and TTS are authorized events on conventional strafe pits.
       HAS is not authorized. Maximum authorized strafe dive angle is 20. During TTS,
       Pit 1 must be strafed first followed by Pit 2 (inside strafe target, then outside strafe
       target).
       3.8.3.3.4. Cease fire slant range is 2,000’. Maximum open fire slant range is 7,000’.
       3.8.3.3.5. Weapons release clearance from RCO is required on each pass to strafe on
       the conventional pits. Only the RCO is authorized to provide positive clearance.
       3.8.3.3.6. Strafing on the conventional strafe pits is not authorized during Class B/C
       operations.
       3.8.3.3.7. Normal pull-off is to the left (west). Aircraft will not initiate turn out until
       they are positive they will turn past the RCO tower. Aircraft cease firing prior to the
       foul line will initiate a recovery away from the ground, but shall not pull off early and
       overfly tower or manned sites.
       3.8.3.3.8. Between November through March, it is possible that the conventional
       strafe pits will not have the required 12-inch depth of loosen soil (i.e., frozen strafe
       pits). When strafe pits are frozen, strafing is closed for all aircraft except the A/OA-
       10. During pull-off, the A/OA-10 will not overfly strafe pits or the strafe pit’s 3 to 9
       o’clock line, or come closer than 500’ horizontally to the target. Aircraft are not
       authorized to begin their turn out until abeam or past the RCO tower. Aircraft will
       not overfly RCO tower during turnout.
    3.8.3.4. Tactical Strafe Targets:
       3.8.3.4.1. Tactical strafe targets are designated in the 366 FW Range Handbook.
       3.8.3.4.2. LAS, LRS, TTS and HAS are authorized events on tactical strafe targets.
       3.8.3.4.3. Maximum authorized strafe dive angle on targets 16-17 is 45. Strafing at
       greater than 45 will damage the strafe scoring system. Strafe scoring on target 16-17
       is only accurate up to dive angles of 30. Maximum authorized strafe dive angle on all
       other tactical strafe targets is 60.
       3.8.3.4.4. Cease fire slant range on all tactical strafe targets for 20mm ammunition
       and larger is 3,000’. Maximum open fire slant range is 10,000’ for planned dive
       angles less than 30. Maximum open fire slant for planned dive angles equal to or
       greater than 30 is 12,000’ for targets 16-17 and 15,000’ for all other tactical strafe
       targets.
 38         AFI13-212_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFB_ADD_A 17 JANUARY 2012

      must conduct a telephonic or face-to-face brief with the RCO prior to going on range.
      JTACs must provide RCO a general scenario, type of ordnance delivered and their
      planned general location. JTACs may deviate from planned scenario with RCO approval.
      RCO has authority to deny change.
      3.9.9.2. Prior to expenditure of actual ordnance JTACs must receive Weapons Clearance
      Authority from RCO and aircraft must have received Flight Lead Control clearance.
      3.9.9.3. Unless JTACs are located at Observation Points, RCO is unable to verify JTACs
      exact location on range and cannot necessarily provide ground parties an extra layer of
      safety when ordnance is being expended. It is critical that Flight Leads have JTACs in
      sight when ordnance is being expended and JTACs are not at OPs. The JTACs and pilot
      in command are solely responsible for safety of the ground party.

                        ELECTRONIC COMBAT (EC) TRAINING

4.1. Purpose. EC training provided by the 266 RANS simulates an enemy electronic threat
environment to support aircrew training requirements and tactics development. Provides realistic
threat scenarios for aircrew to exercise systems; e.g., Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)/Electronic
Counter Measures (ECM)/Dispensable Countermeasures (i.e., CHAFF), in conjunction with
weapons delivery.
4.2. Scheduling:
   4.2.1. Utilize EC threats without entering MHRC airspace, however if access to MHRC
   airspace is desired, contact 366 OSS/OSOS at DSN 728-2172 or Comm: (208) 828-2172.
   266 RANS/DOS cannot provide clearance into or scheduling of MHRC airspace.
   4.2.2. Coordinate EC support after obtaining airspace from 366 OSS/OSOS. To schedule
   threats, call Sagebrush at DSN 728-6026/6069, Comm: (208) 828-6026, FAX to DSN 728-
   6138 or by emailing 266RANSSAGEBRUSH@mountainhome.af.mil.
   4.2.3. A list of threats and threat locations that are scheduled for the current week are
   published at https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/DocMan/DOCMain.asp?FolderID=AC-
   OP-03-19-4&Filter=AC-OP-03-19.
   4.2.4. Refer to Attachment 10, EC Coordination Checklist, 266 RANS “Sagebrush,” which
   is available electronically on the 366 FW Scheduling CoP under “Customer Guide” (see
   above for the link).
   4.2.5. EC threats are available during 366 FW flying hours, Monday through Friday. EC
   window is adjusted to accommodate LFEs, surge operations, special missions and IDANG
   drill weekends. EC availability may be obtained from 266 RANS/DOS. Moving threats to
   specified EC sites requires a minimum 2-day notice. Notify 266 RANS/DOS as soon as
   possible if canceling EC training times.
4.3. Events:
   4.3.1. Coordinate EC events with 266 RANS/DOS. Threats represent area of responsibility
   according to 366 FW training plan. Special requests may be accommodated on a case-by-
   case basis. For information contact 266 RANS/DOS.
   4.3.2. Re-programmable and non-reprogrammable ECM pods are authorized for use in
   MHRC.
4.4. Restrictions
   4.4.1. Follow all applicable airspace restrictions.

4.5. Communications.
   4.5.1. Phone Numbers:
Function                                                  Phone #

Sagebrush (IADS Director)                                 DSN 728-6069
266 RANS/DOS (EC Operations/Scheduling)                   DSN 728-6026
366 FW/EWO (Wing Electronic Warfare Officer)              DSN 728-4700
   4.5.2. EC Threat Director call sign is Sagebrush. Sagebrush can be reached in air on UHF
   251.2 and with RCO prior approval 262.75. Other UHF/VHF communications may be
   available with prior coordination.
4.6. Tactics:
   4.6.1. Simulated IADS. 266 RANS simulated IADS is designed to defend targets on MHRC
   with a variety of SAM and AAA radar simulators. Sagebrush uses Cowboy Control’s radar
   feeds for long range early warning surveillance and provides target location to threat radars
   located on the MHRC. Sagebrush simulates a sector operations center (SOC), allowing
   threat operators a combination of autonomous and centralized control, depending on training
   level requested. Threat operators use AFTTP 3-1, Volume II, for threat capabilities and
   engagement envelopes. Radars with Selective Identification Feature (SIF) only tracking
   capability, manually cycle through threat modes based on AFTTP 3-1, Volume II. SIF
   tracking radar simulators manually downgrade modes when jam or maneuvers are reported.
   Contact 266 RANS Sagebrush, DSN 728-6026, for detailed description of available threat
   levels.
   4.6.2. Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD). Real time threat radar kills are passed
   via Very High Frequency (VHF) or Ultra High Frequency (UHF) communications with
   Sagebrush. High-speed anti-radiation missile (HARM) and other air-to-ground ordnance can
   be used to simulate AAA/SAM radar destruction. Missile launch and weapon impact calls
   are transmitted to Sagebrush. Threat on/off criteria will be based on specific flight lead
   requests IAW training requirements. If "smart operators" are requested, threats will stop
   radiating only if operator did not perform anti-HARM tactics during missile time of flight.
       4.6.2.1. SEAD Profiles. SEAD Profiles are run similarly to the threat profiles referenced
       above with the additional options available. Contact 266 RANS Sagebrush at DSN 728-
       6026 for coordination.
       4.6.2.2. Ghost Targets. Notional Strikers/Ghost targets may be requested in conjunction
       with any of the above profiles. Sagebrush will provide threat operators simulated
       locations of an aircraft attacking targets on MHRC. Threats operators will aim their
       radars and transition modes as if tracking an actual aircraft. Sagebrush will create pre-
       plan ghost target flight paths from flight lead inputs or use generic flight paths.
       4.6.2.3. Smart Operators. Smart operators may be requested in conjunction with any
       threat profile. Operators will attempt to track and shoot aircraft while performing anti-
       HARM tactics.

4.7. Operations:
   4.7.1. EC training may be conducted in conjunction with MHRC target area usage, including
   no-drop targets. All flights expecting/using ground threats can contact Sagebrush on 251.2.
   Threats can be provided to aircraft inside or outside the MHRC. Aircraft inside the MHRC
   will have priority on threat presentation.
   4.7.2. Aircrew will notify Sagebrush on 251.2 or pre-briefed UHF/VHF when terminating
   EC training events.
   4.7.3. Jamming restrictions are IAW MHRC Electronic Attack clearance approved by ACC.
   Frequency bands listed below are a partial list of frequencies that will not be jammed in the
MHRC:

SEARCH               2710 megahertz (Mhz) – 2775 Mhz
BEACON               1030 Mhz – 1090 Mhz

   (DSN 728-4707), 366 OSS/OSK (DSN 728-4707) or 366ossosk@mountainhome.af.mil .
4.8. Simulators
   4.8.1. 266 RANS employs only threat simulators, no real threat systems.
   4.8.2. Smokey SAM Simulators (SSS) or Smokey Gun Simulator (SGS) operations are only
   approved on the Saylor Creek Range impact area and during Class A operations. SSS and
   SGS use during Class B/C operations require prior coordination and approval by 366
   OSS/OSOR. RCOs may instruct personnel to cease operations if any unsafe condition is
   observed.
4.9. Feedback:
   4.9.1. For threat engagements, in-flight feedback may be requested using the pre-coordinated
   threat nomenclature. When requested, Sagebrush will also provide written engagement
   reports to EC users as soon as practical after each flight. Nonstandard requests will be
   coordinated with 266 RANS/DOS
   4.9.2. Jamming feedback can be available after engagement. Feedback is based on the
   presence of jamming only. Unclassified comments on the range engagement report may
   further describe jamming effectiveness. Jamming feedback must be requested in advance of
   mission by coordinating with 266 RANS/DOS.
   4.9.3. Unclassified threat video feedback can be provided with prior coordination. Video is

(ACMI) systems, Measurement and Debriefing Systems (MDS), and Tactical Air Combat
Training Systems (TACTS) used by the United States Air Force (USAF).
6.2. User Requirements.
   6.2.1. Contact Information: Office: 366 OSS/OSO P5 CTS, DSN              728-8085/4448 or
   Commercial: 208-828-8085/4448 or Fax: 208-828-3945.
   6.2.2. All visiting units/exercise participants requesting P5 support must provide 366
   OSS/OSO the following information NLT 48 hours prior to first take-off:
      6.2.2.1. Visiting Unit Designator, POC, home and deployed contact info
      6.2.2.2. Type Aircraft
      6.2.2.3. Type Launcher
      6.2.2.4. Dates of Visit – Include final departure time from MHAFB
      6.2.2.5. Number/Type of P5 Pods required (V1/V2)
      6.2.2.6. Station P5 Pods will be Loaded On
      6.2.2.7. Number of Data Recording Devices (DRD) required (if not using host unit
      DRDs)
      6.2.2.8. Specific Pre/Post Mission Support (DRD prep/data merge/MLU set-up etc.)
      6.2.2.9. RTO/Live Monitor Support (pre/post mission requirements, mission times)
   6.2.3. In addition to the information in paragraph 6.2.2, all Non-USAF aircraft must provide
   the following information at least 7n days prior to first flight.
      6.2.3.1. Flight Clearance/Seek Eagle Clearance Information. For aircraft that have not
      flown with the P5 pod previously, flight clearance process must start NLT 90 days prior.

AFI13-212_ACCSUP_MOUNTAINHOMEAFB_ADD_A 17 JANUARY 2012                                             61


6.3. Restrictions. USN/USMC aircraft can only fly with P5 (V2) pods. P5 (V2) pods must be
equipped with ballast weights and Navy parallel umbilical IAW flight clearance documentation.
MHAFB has ten P5 V2 pods on station and twenty Navy parallel umbilical’s for use by visiting
USN/USMC units. GAF Tornado aircraft can fly with P5 V1 pods but must be connected with a
Navy parallel umbilical.
6.4. Operations. Upload and download of P5 CTS pods is performed by contractor personnel.
Contractor duty hours are either 8 hours per day/5 days a week, or 10 hours per day/4 days a
week. Hours are determined by 366 FW flying schedule. All P5 pods are connected to the
aircraft launcher via AIM-9 umbilical which filters out data recorded by the pod except for time,
space, positioning information (TSPI). P5 operations at MHAFB are conducted in the
unclassified mode. Provide aircrew a DRD prior to step. Conduct post mission data
download/merge in the respective fighter squadron or designated exercise debrief location. P5
live monitor is available at Cowboy Control for Range Training Officer (RTO) missions. Refer
to Attachment 11, ICADS “RTO” MSN Request, to complete an RTO mission sheet and fax to
both the P5 pod shop and Cowboy Control.
6.5. Feedback. A P5 mission is considered successful if the pod records 100 percent of aircraft
TSPI data from engine start to engine shut down. If a P5 pod fails during any phase of pre-flight,
in-flight, or post-flight it is considered a non-effective sortie. It is the aircrew responsibility to
complete Attachment 12, P5 Mission Evaluation Checklist, a P5 aircrew feedback sheet and fax
it to the P5 pod shop. Once received, remove the pod in question from the flightline for
troubleshooting and provide a replacement pod. See Attachment 13, Distribution List, for a list
of addresses to receive this publication.
