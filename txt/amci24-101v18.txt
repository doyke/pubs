Section A—General

1. General.
   1.1. This section outlines responsibilities and provides guidance for AMC mobilized aerial
   port forces. The commander is responsible for planning and directing all activities associated
   with mobility operations. The commander will monitor personnel Air Expeditionary Force
   (AEF) availability, personnel tempo (PERSTEMPO) availability beyond AEF, equipment
   status, daily projected workload, and worldwide mobility status and ensure training is
   accomplished and updated as required.
   1.2. AMC mobilized aerial port forces are highly mobile and flexible units organized for and
   capable of rapid deployment by air or surface to augment AMC theater airlift forces and/or to
   support operations or contingencies.
   1.3. Mobilized aerial port forces may be tasked to support any type of airlift mission during
   war or military operations other than war and must be able to transition seamlessly as the
   mission changes. The mission of mobilized aerial port forces is to provide cargo and
   passenger handling services at all levels to meet all operational requirements.
   1.4. One of the primary functions is to establish and operate non-fixed air terminals at
   employment sites where no permanent air terminal organization exists. Deployment
   operations may vary from as little as one individual with no equipment to one or more fully
   deployed units with a variety of equipment. Note: Units will operate under the provisions of
   this instruction and applicable volumes of AMCI 24-101 until the appropriate command
   agency designates the mobile unit as a permanent detachment or operating location.
   Additional directives will be cited throughout this instruction and should be referenced for
   detailed procedures.
   1.5. Contingency Response Group/Element/Team (CRG/E/T) per AMCI 10-202, Vol. 4,
   Expeditionary Air Mobility Support Operations.
      1.5.1. Contingency Response Group (CRG): CRGs are designed to deploy with the first
      responders for opening airbases. These units will bridge the gap between the seizure
      forces and the follow-on combat/expeditionary combat support forces. CRGs are critical
      to the AF’s ability to rapidly deploy U.S. military forces and initiate air operations of any
      type in minimal time at any AMC suitable base or location around the globe. CRGs may
      also provide C2, aerial port services, quick turn maintenance, force protection and
      various airbase support capabilities for AMC’s Global Mobility mission.
      1.5.2. Contingency Response Element (CRE):            A provisional, deployed AMC
      organization established at fixed, en route, and deployed locations where AMC
      operational support is non-existent or insufficient. A CRE provides continuing on-site
      management of AMC airfield operations including C2, communications, aerial port and
      maintenance on a smaller scale than the full CRG team that opens the base. These
      critical elements are needed to ensure a safe and highly efficient air base for all tanker
      and airlift operations. A basic CRE is normally expected to support a Working
      Maximum Operating on the Ground (MOG) of two aircraft with 24-hour coverage;
      however, with additional personnel, they can expand to handle many more aircraft as
      required.
 4                                                        AMCI24-101V18 22 AUGUST 2013


        1.5.3. Contingency Response Team (CRT). A CRT performs the same functions as a
        CRE, but on a smaller scale. The CRT is led by an enlisted supervisor (7-level or above)
        trained within the unit and certified by the commander. A CRT is capable of supporting
        operations for 12 hours a day, but will maintain 24 hour C2 coverage.
     1.6. Contingency Support Element (CSE): CSEs provide a specific mission support
     capability other than the core command and control, logistic, or aerial port service. They
     may be deployed as an element of a CRG, CRE, CRT, or as a small scale standalone entity.
     1.7. The terms “CRW, CRG, GAMSS , Air Mobility Squadrons (AMS), and Airlift Control
     Flight (ALCF) are interchangeable with, and will be described using the term AMCU for in-
     garrison. The terms “CRG, CRE, CRT, and CSE” are interchangeable with and will be
     described using the term “Global Mobility Forces” for deployed operations.

Section B—In-Garrison Activities

2. Deployed Survivability for Mobilized Aerial Port Forces. (Applicable to selected ARC
units when operational plan (OPLAN) requirements exist). The ability to deploy aerial port
assets, establish airlift support operations, and sustain those operations in any type of
environment, whether it be military operations other than war, or war itself, is critically
important to the mission of all aerial port units. Training in deployed survivability and force
protection is essential to the success of operations in austere or potentially hostile locations
where little or no security forces are present.
     2.1. Weapons.
        2.1.1. Theater reporting instructions determine whether personnel will deploy with
        weapons. If required, the GAU/M-4/M-16 is the standard weapon for mobilized aerial
        port forces. Officers will have the option of deploying with the GAU/M4/M-16 and/or a
        9MM.
        2.1.2. All weapons qualification standards for active duty (AD) and ARC personnel
        groups A and B are IAW AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Program. Arming groups A and B
        are defined IAW AFI 31-117, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel.
     2.2. Deployed Survivability Training.
        2.2.1. Mobilized aerial port forces will establish an in-house deployed survivability
        program to ensure all personnel receive training at required intervals. This program can
        be adjusted as necessary to meet local environmental and equipment availability
        considerations. At a minimum, units will meet the training requirements IAW AFI 10-
        403, Deployment Planning and Execution. Lesson plans should be developed using
        AFPAM 10-100, Airman’s Manual. The following may be used to satisfy deployed
        survivability training:
            2.2.1.1. Ability To Survive and Operate (ATSO).
            2.2.1.2. Exercise Eagle Flag.
            2.2.1.3. Integrated Defense Training.
            2.2.1.4. Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC).
AMCI24-101V18 22 AUGUST 2013                                                                  5


          2.2.1.5. Local wing Mobility Exercises (MOBEX) and Field Training Exercises
          (FTX).
          2.2.1.6. Deployments under field conditions. Note: Field conditions are mandatory
          for all scenarios to qualify as meeting the requirement.
   2.3. Training Documentation. Units will document training IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force
   Training Program, AMCI 24-101, Vol. 20, Air Transportation Standardization Evaluation
   (ATSEV) Quality Assurance and AMCI 24-101,Vol. 22. Personnel assigned within the CRW
   will also follow the guidance of AMCI 10-202,Vol. 4. Exception: AMCI 24-101, Vol. 20
   will not apply to ANG CRGs.

Section C—AMC Tasking Methodology

3. General.
   3.1. The AMC Aerial Port tasking policy is designed to properly assign aerial port personnel
   to a wide variety of possible mission scenarios. The policy prioritizes units to be tasked
   based on the nature of the mission.
   3.2. The CRW is AMC’s contingency response force, the Aerial Port Squadrons (APS) are
   AMC’s primary source for AEF support and sustainment operations, and the overseas AMS
   are the backbone of the En Route system which also provide some AEF support.
   3.3. Deployed operations are generally supported by aerial port personnel performing one of
   four mission types:
      3.3.1. Global Air Mobility Support System (GAMSS). 621st CRW/108 CRG/123 CRG
      are designed to provide initial GAMSS forces and facilitate the transition to long-range
      sustainment operations.
      3.3.2. Unit move operations. Are generally supported by the CRW/ CRGs (AD or ARC)
      and APS (AD or ARC).
      3.3.3. Break-bulk operations. This is typically a fixed port operation generally supported
      by an APS (AD or ARC) or an AMS.
      3.3.4. Backfill or augmentation of existing organization. Generally performed by ARC
      aerial port personnel through use of Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA) man-days;
      can also be filled by AD aerial port personnel if workload permits.
   3.4. Tasking Process.
      3.4.1. The 18 AF/A3M will task initial response and equipment requirements as well as
      support for training AMC Contracted Air Terminal and Ground Handling Services
      personnel while HQ AMC/A4OL will task AEF steady state type tasking. Both 18
      AF/A3M and HQ AMC/A4OL will use the following steps:
          3.4.1.1. Determine mission type and size requirement.
          3.4.1.2. Determine when Time Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD)/Unit
          Line Number (ULN) flow ceases and those forces will have a Change of Operational
          Control (CHOP) to the theater/supported Combatant Commander for sustainment
          (long-range 2T2 requirements).
6                                                         AMCI24-101V18 22 AUGUST 2013


           3.4.1.3. Determine proper Unit Type Codes (UTC) required based on Mission
           Capability Statements (MISCAPS).
           3.4.1.4. Determine the most appropriate unit to provide the required UTC utilizing
           the AEF Libraries and concurrently determine possible ARC involvement.
           3.4.1.5. ANG Tasking authority will review available UTCs through the UTC
           Management Information System (UMIS) and reference Air Reserve Technician
           (ART) as to availability for tasking.
           3.4.1.6. Levy UTC taskings.
    3.5. Tasking Priority.
       3.5.1. Unit tasking priority will vary based on whether the mission is:
           3.5.1.1. An initial response, GAMSS type tasking (Priority A).
           3.5.1.2. An AEF steady state type tasking (Priority B).
       3.5.2. For tasking Priority A, units will be tasked by 18 AF/A3M in the following order:
           3.5.2.1. CRW and ANG CRGs.
           3.5.2.2. Aerial Port Squadrons.
           3.5.2.3. ARC Small Air Terminals following activation or utilizing available MPA
           resources.
           3.5.2.4. Enroutes (The decision to accept an AMS tasking will be made by the
           AMOW/CC)
           3.5.2.5. If the AMOW/CC shortfalls the requirement, sourcing will revert to the
           priority list.
       3.5.3. For tasking Priority B, units will be tasked by HQ AMC/A4OL:
           3.5.3.1. Tasking Priority B will be tasked to the APS in assigned AEF period.
       3.5.4. Taskings for support of locations having terminal service contracts.
           3.5.4.1. The theater is required to provide AMC with 10-days advance notice when
           they require augmentation in support of local wing exercises/training. Every effort
           will be made to support theater exercise/training requirements with AMC
           augmentation.
       3.5.5. Taskings requiring Logistics Readiness/21RX field grade officers with aerial port
       experience. AEF Center will identify core 21RX field grade requirements to HQ
       AMC/A4O. HQ AMC/A4O will be the single point of contact for 21R field grade
       taskings requiring a Logistics Readiness field grade officer. HQ AMC/A4O will review
       the specific tasking requirements and line remarks and determine level of experience
       needed and forward to Functional Area Manager. In the event, the Logistics Readiness
       Officer Functional Area Manager is unable to fill the requirements, the shortfall will be
       rerouted back through HQ AMC/A4O who will formally shortfall the transportation levy
       back to the AEF Center for the command. 18 AF/A3M will task Non-steady/Non-
       rotational/Crisis Action related CRW 21RX field grade requirements. Note: ANG/A3F
       is the coordinating agency for ANG/CRG 21RX’s.
AMCI24-101V18 22 AUGUST 2013                                                                    7


          3.5.5.1. Tasking Shortfalls: Refer to AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and
          Execution, and AFI 10-403.

Section D—Vehicles and Material Handling Equipment (MHE)

4. General.
   4.1. Equipment to support all taskings will, as a general rule, come from either
   theater/CONUS war reserve materials (WRM) or the aerial port squadrons. During exercise
   planning, every effort should be made to use theater WRM to minimize transportation costs.
   If theater WRM is not available, equipment requirements will be tasked to the CRWs or
   pulled from CONUS WRM locations. HQ AMC/A4TR is available to assist in the
   coordination of the use of theater stocks if required. CONUS fixed aerial ports and en route
   units are authorized only enough MHE to handle their peacetime workload. These units
   should not be tasked to support deployment requirements from peacetime operating stocks
   (POS) without close coordination with the unit commander or theater wing commander.
   4.2. The squadron/group Vehicle Control Officer/Non-Commissioned Officer
   (VCO/VCNCO) will control assigned vehicles for mobile aerial port forces. Due to their
   unique mobility mission, a close liaison between the wing VCO/VCNCO, squadron/group
   VCO/VCNCO and mobility unit are required to maintain a successful vehicle management
   program.
   4.3. Tasked vehicles and MHE must receive a Limited Technical Inspection (LTI) from the
   host vehicle maintenance function. Refer to AFI 24-302, Vehicle Management, for more
   information. All tasked equipment must deploy with appropriate Technical Orders (TO) and
   either a Mobility Readiness Spare Package (MRSP) or Temporary Mission Support Kit
   (TMSK) IAW AFI 24-302. Responsibility begins with unit VCO/VCNCO through close
   coordination with base transportation.
   4.4. 18 AF/A3M will determine the requirement for a special purpose vehicle mechanic and
   TMSK based on the duration and nature of the mission and the type of MHE deployed.
   4.5. Base supply will segment the MRSP by vehicle type to assure maximum flexibility.
   This segmentation must remain constant to preclude loss of property and maintain kit
   integrity. Each segment may be deployed individually to meet operational requirements.
   Note: TOs and Logistics Detail (LOGDET) items will remain with deployed vehicles and
   MHE. These assets will be returned to the owning unit when the vehicle or equipment is
   returned to home station.
   4.6. Vehicles and MHE should not remain in a deployed status for more than 6 months, and
   if in a harsh environment with limited support, rotation at 90 days should be considered.
   Failure to rotate equipment may degrade the readiness and serviceability of the deployed
   assets. Visibility over assets is required at all levels and the 618th Air and Space Operations
   Center (TACC) (AOC) must ensure a viable rotation program. The LTI process should prep
   vehicles and MHE for harsh environments, (e.g., Antarctica). Note: Unless assigned to a
   specific equipment UTC; unit equipment (electronics, computers, etc) will be rotated with the
   assigned unit. Each deploying unit will furnish its own capability unless the original
   capability was theater-furnished. This will ensure the unit redeploying is properly equipped
   to handle subsequent deployment requirements.

Section E—Planning Phase

5. Pre-deployment Planning.
     5.1. If AMC mobilized aerial port forces (CRG/E/T, APS) are deployed as a “Stand Alone”
     capability, or become “Stand Alone” because of other unit(s) taskings; they should have, as a
     minimum, the following communication and equipment capabilities: laptops, printers, and,
     portable scales. Reference para. 6.7 of this instruction for further guidance regarding
     communication capabilities.
     5.2. Personnel.
        5.2.1. Manning requirements are generally determined at HQ AMC IAW Manpower
        Force Requirements (MANFOR).
            5.2.1.1. The MANFOR is a close approximation of manning requirements and is
            primarily based upon the planned number of aircraft, cargo tonnage, and passengers.
            The number of work shifts is also considered in MANFOR. The UTCs and
            MISCAPS contained in the MANFOR are based upon contingency workload factors.
            5.2.1.2. UTCs may be tailored based upon projected requirements.
            5.2.1.3. When UTC requirements have been determined, key personnel will be
            selected, notified, and briefed on the operation.
     5.3. Vehicles and MHE. Vehicles and MHE will be deployed in sufficient quantities to meet
     mission requirements as specified in the tasking, the OPLAN, Operations Order (OPORD)
     and/or Logistics Force Packaging Subsystem (LOGFOR).
     5.4. General Planning. Using available airfield surveys and other sources of information, key
     personnel will ensure that prior to deployment:
        5.4.1. Provisions for air terminal facilities are made at the employment site.
        5.4.2. Sufficient manpower, equipment, communications, and supplies are deployed.
        5.4.3. Sufficient personnel and equipment are planned to be in place in advance of the
        time they will be needed.

Section F—Execution Phase

6. Initial Employment Tasks.
     6.1. Upon arrival at the employment site, aerial port personnel will begin preparing for
     operations. The team chief will contact the 18 AF/A3M/Mission Support Cell (MSC) at DSN
     576-8315/COMM 618-256-8315 or 1-800-AIRMOBL, option 7 to advise the team is in-
     place. Additionally, the team chief will contact the employment site air operations agency,
     such as the CRG/E/T or base operations, to confirm the support provided by the host
     organization. The team chief will also confirm MOG, parking plan and time-sensitive nature
     of missions to be worked (i.e., multiple aircraft airdrop formation, etc.). In some cases, unit
     move and sustainment operations will be conducted simultaneously.
     6.2. Customer Liaison and Arrival/Departure Airfield Control Group (A/DACG). As soon
     as possible after arrival, establish contact and rapport with the customer at the employment
AMCI24-101V18 22 AUGUST 2013                                                                  9


  site. This coordination is vital in establishing documentation and data transfer requirements,
  chalk arrival times, joint inspection sequence and location, clarification of mission planning
  details, and determination of customer assistance.
  6.3. Deploying as part of a CRG/E/T.
     6.3.1. When aerial port forces are deployed with a CRG/E/T, they are members of that
     CRG/E/T. The senior aerial port representative is responsible to the CRG/E/T for the
     management of all aerial port assets/operations.
     6.3.2. Supervisory requirements should be coordinated between the CRG/E commander
     or CRT chief and the aerial port staff prior to deployment.
     6.3.3. The CRG/E commander/CRT chief ensures the senior aerial port representative is
     briefed on the latest pertinent data to include OPLAN changes, intelligence information
     changes, aircraft estimated time of arrival/departure (ETA/ETD), ground time,
     programmed loads and all other changes affecting operations.
  6.4. Personnel Utilization. Work schedules for deployed aerial port operations are based on
  individuals working l2-hour shifts. Adverse climatic conditions may dictate shorter work
  periods. After completion of a continuous duty period, commanders and supervisors must
  ensure personnel are provided a rest period of sufficient duration to allow a minimum of 8
  hours uninterrupted sleep.
  6.5. Quarters. Mobilized aerial port forces will make every effort to use suitable government
  or contract quarters at the deployed location in accordance with AFI 32-1024, Standard
  Facility Requirements. The senior aerial port representative must be available to the
  command and control agency at all times. For this reason, as a minimum, telephone
  communications must be available in their assigned quarters. It is the responsibility of the
  team chief to ensure adequate quarters are available for all personnel subject to their
  command and control.
  6.6. Aerial Port Control Center (APCC). During a contingency or exercise, AMC may
  provide an Air Mobility Element (AME) to the theater Combatant Commander/Air Force
  Component Commander (AFCC). The AME will operate theater air mobility forces and
  monitor/manage AMC en route global forces. The AME will include an APCC.
  6.7. Communications.
     6.7.1. Internal communications. Dedicated telephone lines and non-tactical radio nets
     are the most effective means of providing communications. The Air Terminal Operations
     Center (ATOC) must establish communications with the Tactical Operations Center
     (TOC), if deployed. Minimum requirement is one land mobile radio (LMR) for direct
     communication between ATOC and TOC. A radio net, which utilizes numerous base
     stations and portable units, will provide immediate communications to all sections and
     key personnel simultaneously. In addition, such a net is readily deployable and lends
     itself to easy expansion to support the requirements of any size operation.
     6.7.2. High Frequency (HF) Radios. In order to carry out their wartime function, all
     units will have HF radio sets assigned. Primarily, these radios will be used for exercises
     and contingencies and may be used for daily training. These radios must be continually
     maintained and ready for deployment at all times. Recommended call sign for aerial port
10                                                     AMCI24-101V18 22 AUGUST 2013


     units is “PORT” followed by a numerical suffix (i.e. “PORT One”). All efforts should be
     made to have radio frequencies re-keyed prior to arrival at the deployed location.
     6.7.3. Station-To-Station Communications. When two or more units are deployed,
     communications between the CSE and the deployed CRG/E/T will become vitally
     important to effective aerial port management. The most effective type of communication
     for this purpose is a dedicated HF radio net. Dedicated telephone lines should also be
     used, if available.
     6.7.4. Frequencies. Units must coordinate with their local frequency managers before
     they can operate any radio type and/or with the responsible CRG/E/T for deployed
     operations. Note: ATOC will need to confirm with CRG/E/T that radios are capable of
     going secure or utilize UTC UFBS1 which has encryption capable LMRs.
     6.7.5. International Maritime/Marine Satellite (INMARSAT) or Broadband Global Area
     Network System (BGANS). Units deploying with Deployed Global Air Transportation
     Execution System (DGATES) may require an INMARSAT or BGANS to transmit data
     to the Global Air Transportation Execution System (GATES) Central Database. Due to
     cost, INMARSAT or BGANS should be the last method used to establish DGATES
     connectivity when commercial phone, DSN, and Non- Secure Internet Protocol Router
     Network (NIPRNET) are not available. Training unit personnel to operate INMARSAT
     or BGANS will be a key factor to successful data submission. INMARSAT/BGANS
     Commanders must establish a viable INMARSAT/BGANS training program. Units can
     obtain GATES web-based training at https://amc.csd.disa.mil.
  6.8. Unit Moves.
     6.8.1. The primary directives guiding unit movements are DoD 4500.9-R, Defense
     Transportation Regulation (DTR); AFMAN 24-204_IP, Preparing Hazardous Materials
     for Military Air Shipments; and AFI 10-403.
     6.8.2. North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Standardization Agreements
     (STANAG). STANAGs may apply to combined airlift operations. When a STANAG is
     in force, it supersedes all US directives otherwise in conflict. All applicable NATO
     STANAGs will be complied with during joint force NATO operations. For operations
     involving NATO forces, the provisions of NATO STANAGs may be applicable.
     6.8.3. Deploying units will ensure that all cargo is properly prepared, packed, marked
     and labeled IAW DoD 4500.9-R, DTR (Part II and III), MIL-STD-129, Military Marking
     for Shipment and Storage, and any other service specific applicable directives.
     6.8.4. Deploying units will provide electronic and hard copy data/transportation
     documentation IAW DoD 4500.9-R, DTR (Part II and III).
     6.8.5. Deploying units will ensure that all hazardous cargo submitted for transportation
     within the air portion of Defense Transportation System (DTS) is properly identified,
     prepared, packaged, marked, labeled, and certified IAW AFMAN 24-204_IP.
     6.8.6. Deploying units will comply with DoD 4500.9-R, DTR (Part V) and AFI 24-405,
     Department of Defense Foreign Clearance Guide for Customs, Immigration, and
     Agricultural requirements.
AMCI24-101V18 22 AUGUST 2013                                                                11


       6.8.7. Deploying units will prepare and manifest passengers IAW DoD 4500.9-R, DTR
       (Part I and III).
       6.8.8. Deploying units will follow In-transit Visibility (ITV) timeliness criteria IAW
       DoD 4500.9-R, DTR (Part III).

Section G—Mobilized Aerial Port Responsibilities

7. ATOC.
   7.1. When tasked for a deployment where an ATOC is required, establish this function upon
   arrival at the employment site. Depending upon the size and scope of the operation, this
   function may vary from a one-person operation to a fully operational ATOC.
       7.1.1. ATOC is responsible for ensuring all functions to support an operation are in
       place, as required. The success of a deployed ATOC function is dependent upon close
       coordination with base operations, CRG/E/T, or the theater APCC, as applicable. ATOC
       will also be dependent upon the timely flow of information between applicable agencies.
       ATOC provides this overall coordination and direction of deployed aerial port activities
       IAW AMCI 24-101, Vol. 9, Air Terminal Operations Center.
       7.1.2. ATOC functions include, but are not limited to, the following:
             7.1.2.1. Maintaining AMC Form 68 to record aircraft movement.
                7.1.2.1.1. Required paperwork will be determined using the UTC MISCAP for
                missions arriving and/ or departing to be included in the AMC Form 68 with the
                following:
Arrival:
                  Passenger Manifest
                               Cargo Manifest

Departure:
                         Signed Passenger Manifest
           Cargo Manifest
           Signed Hazardous Material Brief Sheet
           Signed ICODES load plan or AMC Form 4080, Load/Sequence Breakdown Sheet
           Signed Shippers Declaration of Dangerous Goods (SDDG)
           Signed DD Form 2133, Joint Airlift Inspection Record
           Completed AMC Forms 1015, Hazmat Inspection and Acceptance Checklist
           Completed DD Form 1387-2, Special Handling Data/Certification
           Air Transportability Test Loading (ATTLA) Certifications
           Exemptions/Waivers




                   7.1.2.1.1.1. When UTC UFBBR, UFBCP, UFBML, or UFBN2 are deployed
                   there are no paperwork gathering requirements as these are augmenting UTCs
                   to an existing capability.
12                                                   AMCI24-101V18 22 AUGUST 2013


     7.1.2.2. Ensure every aircraft departs with a validated load plan, accurate cargo
     and/or signed passenger manifest. Note: Use of ICODES or AMC Form 4080 load
     plans does not relieve the responsibilities for creating and lifting cargo and passenger
     manifests in GATES.
     7.1.2.3. When no ATOC function is tasked and cargo/passengers are being handled,
     the senior CRW or Aerial Port member will ensure:
        7.1.2.3.1. AMC Form 68 is completed for any mission that is not channel.
     7.1.2.3.2. All applicable station file documents are included in the AMC Form 68.
     Note: This paragraph does not apply to UTC packages listed in paragraph
     7.1.2.1.1.1.
     7.1.2.4. Perform data records functions, to include, the distribution, collection,
     maintenance and filing of all passenger and cargo documentation IAW AMCI 24-101,
     Vol. 6, Transportation Documentation, Data, Records, and Reports.
        7.1.2.4.1. Sites will report Remote Air Transportation System (RGATES)
        registration and manifest register turn-over to the Data Processing Center (DPC),
        which is part of HQ AMC/A4TI. For questions regarding data transfer, the DPC
        can provide just in time training to ensure users are effectively transmitting
        manifest data to DCBS. This in no way relieves the deployed site of their
        responsibility to provide manifest data, a clear audit trail for all transportation
        movements and perform other Data Records duties similar to a fixed aerial port.
        7.1.2.4.2. Locations with connectivity capabilities that have access to GATES
        and DGATES are responsible for transmitting data and maintaining all records
        and reports. It is the responsibility of the down line station to correct their own
        discrepancies, maintain all documentation and manifest registers, and ensure clear
        audit trails are on station.
        7.1.2.4.3. Sites without connectivity that wish to request assistance from the DPC
        must forward their request to HQ AMC/A4TI who will approve/deny the request.
        If approval is attained, specific procedures will be outlined to ensure accurate and
        timely data is passed to meet the specific mission needs of the tasking. ITV
        support provided by the DPC does not relieve the deployed unit of their
        responsibility to provide a clear audit trail and to enter data, maintain records in
        accordance with AF records disposition schedules in AFRIMS, or the
        performance of other Data Records duties. Sites without connectivity forward
        their manifests in XMAN format or typed manual forms to the DPC via email as
        soon as possible but no later than one hour prior to aircraft departure. All
        locations must use the fastest means of transmitting data possible while still
        maintaining accurate, complete, and legible data is submitted. POC submitting
        data to the DPC must confirm receipt and remain available should any questions
        regarding missing or questionable data arise. For more detailed information and
        instructions pertaining to the DPC, refer to AMCI 24-101 Vol. 6. Contact
        information for the DPC is as follows:

8. Passenger Service.
   8.1. Passenger service provides overall direction and control of passenger operations IAW
   AMCI 24-101, Vol. 14, Military Airlift Passenger Service; DoD 4500.9-R, DTR (Part I and
   III) and DoD 4515.13R Air Passenger Eligibility.
   8.2. If tasked Passenger service functions include, but are not limited to:
       8.2.1. Coordinate and establish a passenger processing/holding area.
       8.2.2. Determine passenger eligibility.
       8.2.3. Check border clearance, when required.
       8.2.4. Brief Troop Commander on departure times.
       8.2.5. Weigh passengers and baggage.
       8.2.6. Coordinate manifesting procedures with using unit (i.e. DD Form 2131 and
       mechanized manifest).
       8.2.7. Conduct anti-hijacking inspections and briefings as required.
       8.2.8. Escort passengers to and from the aircraft.
       8.2.9. Validate all passenger documentation received from the airlift user. Input
       passenger data into GATES if service AIT not available or when tasked to provide ITV.
       8.2.10. When assigned seating is necessary, ensure distinguished visitors (DVs) are
       assigned accordingly.
   8.3. Anti-Hijack/Air Terminal Security Operations. Commanders will ensure all personnel
   are aware of and follow the anti-hijacking procedures in DoD, Air Force and AMC
   directives. Air terminal security procedures are based on AMCI 24-101, Vol. 14.
       8.3.1. Due to the wide variety of locations and conditions in which aerial port personnel
       may operate, some of the actual methods and details of terminal security are left to the
       discretion of the senior aerial port representative. If the operation involves overseas
       NATO forces and a combined air terminal is established, the provisions of NATO
       STANAG 3739, Combined Air Terminal Operations, will take precedence over US
       directives.
9. Aircraft Services.
   9.1. Aircraft services provides overall direction and control of cargo operations IAW AMCI
   24-101, Vol. 11, Cargo and Mail Policy and DoD 4500.9-R, DTR (Part II and III).
 14                                                         AMCI24-101V18 22 AUGUST 2013


   9.2. Aircraft service functions include, but are not limited to:
       9.2.1. Establish a Ready Line/Loading Ramp Area.
       9.2.2. Receive cargo from the A/DACG or user. Ensure the cargo is properly prepared,
       marked, labeled, and documented IAW the appropriate regulations DoD 4500.9-R, DTR
       (Part II and III), AFMAN 24-204_IP, and AFI 10-403, as applicable.
       9.2.3. Validate all cargo documentation received from the airlift user. Input cargo data
       in GATES when tasked to provide ITV.
       9.2.4. Perform joint inspection (JI). Note: The joint inspection is extremely important to
       the air deployment process. It is designed as a partnership between mobility and
       transported force representatives. JI personnel must know and adhere to the procedures
       in DoD 4500.9-R, DTR (Part III). Joint inspectors will ensure only properly prepared and
       thoroughly inspected cargo is accepted into the DTS. JI personnel must meet the
       minimum training requirements IAW AMCI 24-101, Vol. 22.
          9.2.4.1. Provide ATOC all cargo documentation (i.e. cargo manifest, JI Forms,
          SDDGs, AMC Form 1015s and certification/waiver letters as required) for recording
          and distribution.
       9.2.5. Receive and release inbound cargo to the A/DACG user.
       9.2.6. Establish a cargo yard to provide positive control of materials and equipment.
       9.2.7. Assemble and preposition loads as required.
       9.2.8. Transport cargo to/from the aircraft.
       9.2.9. On/offload cargo and baggage. Supervise load teams when provided by the user.
10. Fleet Service.
   10.1. The functions of fleet service in a deployed environment are usually minimal, but if a
   fleet service function is required, follow the provisions of AMCI 24-101,Vol. 10, Military
   Airlift-Fleet Service. These provisions may be modified to meet local requirements or
   capabilities. However, units must ensure sanitary handling of food/beverages is accomplished
   through a segregation of duties. Note: Fleet Services UTC does not fall within the CRW
   mission.
   10.2. Do not transport food, beverages, or food service items in a vehicle used to transport
   waste material or cleaning equipment.
   10.3. Ensure the same personnel and vehicles handling the flight food or flight feeding
   equipment do not perform duties that involve cleaning or removal of waste materials from
   the aircraft.
11. Redeployment. As mission intensity diminishes, planning and coordination with the
deployed site command element (CRG/E/T) should be accomplished to develop a gradual roll-up
and phase down of operations. This planning should be accomplished to preclude an excessive
proportion of personnel and equipment relative to the workload remaining at the operating
location. It is recommended equipment be prepared for air shipment as early as possible within
mission constraints. A marshaling area for support equipment should be established. All
deployed support agencies must be notified to deliver their equipment as soon as possible, to
AMCI24-101V18 22 AUGUST 2013                                                                    15


preclude mission delays in redeployment loading. Effective preplanning between aerial port team
chief, CRG/E/T, other support customers, and load planning functions is essential to prevent
difficulties during roll-up operations. Ensure ITV IAW AMCI 24-101, Vol. 6. The senior aerial
port representative will ensure MRSP/TMSK is included with the equipment, or signed for by
the aerial port relief team. Prior to departure, the aerial port team chief or CRG/E/T chief will
contact the 618 AOC/MSC at DSN 779-0371/COMM (618) 229-0371.
12. Deployed Personnel and Equipment (DP&E) Reports
   12.1. Equipment and personnel information is critical to mission planning. Mobilized aerial
   port forces will prepare and submit DP&E as outlined below. Submit the report to the 618
   AOC, DSN 576-8315/COMM 618-256-8315 or 1-800-AIRMOBL, option 7 upon arrival and
   when there is a change in equipment or personnel status. If no changes occur, submission of
   a daily DP&E is not required. However, MSC should be contacted/advised each 24-hour
   period to verify status and receive mission information as needed. Note: If the mobilized
   aerial port force is deployed as part of the CRG/E/T, this DP&E info will be reported by the
   CRG/E/T.
   12.2. Category 1 (MHE). List all Tunner and Halvorsen Loaders, 10K AT/STD forklifts,
   staircase trucks and Latrine Service Trucks at the deployment site. Remarks should include
   vehicle type, registration number, owning command, vehicles out of commission, Estimated
   Time in Commission (ETIC), parts ordered/required, assistance requested, and finish with the
   impact of the shortfall, if any.
   12.3. Category 2 (Pallets/Nets). List all pallets, side and top nets authorized and available at
   the deployment site. Remarks should include any shortages and the number of pallets and
   nets being returned from downline stations on a daily basis.
   12.4. Category 3 (Tie down). List all tie down equipment authorized and on hand at the
   deployment site. Remarks should include the status of tie down equipment at offload
   locations that are not flowing back into the airlift system and steps taken to return equipment
   to the system.
   12.5. Category 4 (Personnel). List all personnel available for deployment, report personnel
   by AFSC, on hand and any problem areas; shortfalls and/or excesses.
13. ITV. It is an integral part of aerial port operations and an ITV UTC has been created that
includes DGATES (incorporates a Radio Frequency Identification [RFID] tag write capability)
and Pallet Tag Interrogation Support Kits [PTISKs] (provide a RFID tag interrogation
capability), to ensure ITV capability for deployed aerial port forces is available to fully support
Combatant Commanders. This capability will document all cargo and passengers moving in the
air portion of the DTS IAW AMCI 24-101, Vol. 9. For instances where connectivity cannot be
achieved see paragraph 7.1.2.4.3. of this volume for instructions.

Section H—Aerial Delivery Flight.

      14.4.1. An adequate stock level of airdrop training loads, equipment, and if required,
      ballast pallets will be maintained by each unit. Determination of quantity will be
      coordinated with the regional airlift wing and will be based on the anticipated upgrade
      and continuation training for the current year considering:
          14.4.1.1. Time required for the initial fabrication/rigging of the loads.
          14.4.1.2. Storage capability of the unit and, if applicable, the operating location.
          14.4.1.3. Time required recovering and rigging the loads.
          14.4.1.4. Distance to the DZ/Extraction Zone (EZ).
          14.4.1.5. Availability and condition of recovery vehicles and/or airlift.
      14.4.2. All aerial delivery training loads will simulate actual aerial delivery load weights
      and configurations as much as possible. All vehicle training loads must be marked “For
      Training Only.” Units will account for these vehicles by maintaining jacket files
      containing the source documents used to withdraw the vehicles from the Defense
      Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO). Maintain this accountability until the
      vehicle is turned back in to DRMO. These vehicles will be used only as aerial delivery
      training loads and will not be repaired or used for any other purpose. To obtain these
      vehicles, units will comply with requirements of AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual.
15. Vehicle Management. The unit VCO/VCNCO will control ADF’s assigned vehicles. A
close liaison between the VCO/VCNCO and ADF are required to maintain a successful vehicle
management program.
