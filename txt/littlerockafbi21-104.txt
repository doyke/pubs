SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document was changed to reflect Little Rock Air Force base changing from an AETC base
to an AMC base. As such, it was substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
1. General. The CDDAR program applies to all USAF host and tenant organizations and is
designed to guide recovery of crashed, damaged or disabled aircraft, on or off base, in a
minimum time period consistent with the following considerations:
     1.1. Requirement to safely open the runway for operational use.
     1.2. Prevention of secondary damage to the aircraft, caused by recovery operations.
     1.3. Preservation of evidence for mishap or accident investigations IAW AFI 91-202 and
     AFI 91-204.
2. Terms:
     2.1. CDDAR Team Members: 2A5X1 personnel assigned to 19 EMS/MXMTR Aero Repair
     (A/R) trained in CDDAR procedures.
     2.2. Normal flying periods: Whenever base assigned aircraft are airborne on scheduled local
     area flights.
     2.3. Crashed: An aircraft which impacts another object or the ground during flight
     operations and the incident creates extensive damage to or destroys the aircraft.
     2.4. Damaged: An aircraft which cannot be moved by its own power or by towing on its
     undercarriage without sustaining considerable secondary damage.
     2.5. Disabled/precautionary landing aircraft: An aircraft which cannot or should not be
     moved using its own power, but can be towed by its undercarriage. This normally includes
     aircraft with blown tires, hot brakes, failed engine(s), and failed hydraulic systems.

     assessment BEE will recommend PPE appropriate for the level of hazard at each individual
     mishap location.
        6.1.1. PPE required to perform recovery of an aircraft containing composite or hazardous
        materials (to include depleted uranium) will be determined by BEE on a case by case
        basis. Typical PPE will include protective clothing and gloves and may, in catastrophic
        incidents, require respiratory protection (RP). In the event respiratory protection is
        required BEE will provide guidance on medical approval and provide respirator fit testing
        for applicable RP. In the event that RP is required BEE will make every effort to identify
        suitable RP from existing stocks of RP on base to preclude any delay in the CDDAR
        process.
        6.1.2. C-130J and many modern aircraft contain composite materials. BEE and LRAFB
        Fire Department personnel will provide initial containment measures for structurally
        damaged composite structures IAW LRAFB Consolidated Emergency Management Plan
        (10-2).
7. CDDAR Exercises:
     7.1. CDDAR will be exercised. Each of the 19 AW, 314 AW, and 189 AW AMUs will be
     invited to participate in at least one exercise annually as coordinated by 19 MXG/MXQA
     (QA) and 314 MXG/MXQI (QA).
     7.2. Each of the following disciplines will be exercised at least annually:
        7.2.1. Aircraft lift exercise to include:
            7.2.1.1. Lift with bags
LITTLEROCKAFBI21-104 19 OCTOBER 2010                                                                 9


           7.2.1.2. Wing lift
           7.2.1.3. Fuseage lift
           7.2.1.4. Jacking
NOTE: Units may position lifting bags and equipment, but will only inflate bags so the bags
mate to the aircraft. Under no circumstances will units attempt to lift an active aircraft off the
ground with bags.
       7.2.2. Clearing disabled aircraft from simulated runway
       7.2.3. Clearing crashed aircraft from simulated runway
       7.2.4. Recovering C-130J aircraft with damaged composites and depleted uranium (to
       include just-in-time respirator training and recovery utilizing respirators) (Integrating
       2A7X3)
