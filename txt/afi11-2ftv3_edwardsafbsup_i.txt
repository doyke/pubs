                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Scope. AFMC produces a three-volume set of Flight Test (FT) instructions containing
attachments for each weapon system flown in AFMC. These instructions are numbered AFI 11-
2FT Volume 1, 2, and 3, and will contain the training, evaluation criteria, and operations
procedures, respectively, for each weapon system. AFMC uses these instructions in lieu of AFI
11-2 MDS-specific Volumes for flying operations. In the absence of published guidance, AFMC
units will coordinate with HQ AFMC/A3V for approval of locally developed guidelines. If
possible, these guidelines should be consistent with similar guidance specified in the appropriate
AFI 11-2 MDS-specific lead MAJCOM Volumes. In addition, aircraft on loan to AFMC
undergoing short-term flight test programs will be flown according to the lead MAJCOM
guidance if no AFMC guidance exists.
1.1. (EDWARDSAFB)The ―412 OG Training/Stan Eval guide‖ describes many of the
processes for coordinating work items through 412 OG/OGV.
     1.1.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Any approval that requires 412 OG/CC approval, may be
     approved by a designated Flight Operations Authority (FOA).
1.2. Recommended Changes. Send comments and suggested improvements to this volume on
AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, through channels to HQ
AFMC/A3V. All correspondence can be emailed to the AFMC/A3V Workflow. HQ AF/A3/5
will approve all interim changes to this instruction.
1.2. (EDWARDSAFB)Recommended Changes. Send AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication, to 412 OG/OGV for coordination.
1.3. Waivers. Unless otherwise specified in this instruction, HQ AFMC/A3 is the waiver
authority for this instruction. All waivers will be routed through appropriate channels to flying
unit commanders, and OG/CCs prior to submission to HQ AFMC/A3V for processing. Use an
AFMC Form 73, AFMC Flight Operations Waiver Request, to process the waiver.
1.3. (EDWARDSAFB)Waivers. Waivers to this supplement will be coordinated through 412
OG/OGV and approved by 412 OG/CC.
1.4. Unit Supplements. Email unit supplements to the AFMC/A3V Workflow for review and
approval prior to publication. Include AFMC/A3V and AFMC/A3O on the distribution list for
approved supplements to AFI 11-2FT Volume 3.
1.5. Developmental Aircraft. Aircraft operations for developmental aircraft will be conducted
in accordance with this instruction and approved test plans. New aircraft-specific attachments
will be created when the aircraft reaches a maturity level that warrants inclusion.
1.6. Inter-fly. Inter-fly is the exchange or substitution of aircrew members and/or aircraft
between AFMC operations groups, MAJCOMs, DoD services, or U.S. government organizations
and agencies. Inter-fly does not apply to routine exchanges of aircraft such as depot input or
output.    Normally, inter-fly should be limited to specific test programs or other special
circumstances. As a minimum, crews will be qualified in the aircraft design and series as well as
systems or configurations required to fly the aircraft and mission. Crew members must
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                      9


thoroughly brief the procedural guidance of the operating MAJCOM, DoD service, U.S.
governmental organization or agency. OG/CCs may authorize inter-fly agreements by mutual
agreement with other participating units. Inter-fly involving the transfer of aircraft between
MAJCOMs or higher must be coordinated and approved through HQ AFMC/A3O. Formalize
agreements through a memorandum of understanding between participating organizations. A
formal inter-fly agreement is not required for aircrew that occasionally act as ―guest help‖ where
the OG/CC has accepted the credentials of the guest aircrew. Formally designated Combined
Test Force (CTF) organizations do not need inter-fly agreements for non-AFMC aircrews
assigned to the CTF.

                                           Chapter 2

                                    MISSION PLANNING

2.1. General. Aircraft commanders and flight leads are ultimately responsible for ensuring all
mission planning materials are current and command guidance is followed. All crewmembers
and formation members must be present for mission planning unless released by the aircraft
commander or flight lead.
2.2. Mission Planning Requirements. The unit commander must ensure that a flight
operations area is available with adequate space for operations management, flight
planning/briefing, and required publications. The unit commander will ensure that aircrews are
provided the following:
   2.2.1. Mission requirements and schedule of events.
   2.2.2. Briefing facilities and aids described in paragraph 2.9.
   2.2.3. Current Flight Information Publications (FLIP). Access to current FLIP may be via
   paper or electronic means. For electronic access to National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
   (NGA) and National Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO) products, a computer with access
   to these sites must be readily available to aircrews. Aircrew must comply with any review
   requirement of electronic NGA products prior to flight. If using electronic products, units
   must develop a plan for aircrew access to FLIP publications in case of internet outage.
   2.2.4. As a minimum, aircrew must have access to the following FLIP products and
   associated documents: General Planning, Area Planning - North and South America, other
   applicable Area Planning volumes, Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Supplement, Visual Flight
   Rules (VFR) Supplement, applicable instrument departure and arrival procedures, applicable
   instrument approach volumes, applicable En Route and Navigational Charts, Flight
   Information Handbook, Airman‘s Information Manual.
   2.2.5. Appropriate regulations and flight manuals (including Modification Flight Manuals)
   must be located in the unit. A current paper copy of all applicable flight manuals and
   technical orders is required in the FCIF library and readily available for aircrew. If a
   conventional paper copy of a flight manual is not available through distribution or local
   printing, then two independent methods of accessing the electronic flight manual must be
   available. The electronic flight manual must be verified to be current and operational. Refer
   to AFI 11-202 Vol 2 and AFMC Sup 1 for FCIF library requirements.
   2.2.6. Commanders will ensure the Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR) is
   available to aircrews, mission planners, and other personnel as required. Also, will ensure
   procedures to ensure personnel can access and use the ASRR to include number of accounts
   and office of responsibility. To access the ASRR or Giant Report users must have a Global
   Decision Support System (GDSS) account. To establish a GDSS account, units must
   establish a Unit Program Account Manager (UPAM) or access (gdss2support.scott.af.mil)
   and follow the instructions under "GDSS Accounts.‖
       2.2.6.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) The ASRR needs to be consulted when going to
       other than local airfields. Local airfields for 412 TW Edwards/Palmdale Plant 42 are:
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                       11


       China Lake NAS, Lemoore NAS, Meadows Field, March ARB, Mojave, Nellis AFB,
       Palmdale Plant 42, Point Mugu NAS, So Cal Logistics (Victorville) and WJ Fox Field.
   2.2.7. Communications equipment for use in obtaining weather, local airfield conditions,
   notices to airman (NOTAM), and filing flight plans. All aircraft must have MAJCOM
   approval to operate aircraft using the Jeppesen Navigational Data Base, and, if approved, are
   directed to consult the Jeppesen Navdata Alerts/NOTAMS web site before each flight located
   at www.jeppesen.com (Aviation Resources).
   2.2.8. There are several methods to obtain digital Terminal Procedures Publications (d-
   TPPs), previously referred to as Instrument Approach Procedures (IAPs) and printed in
   Flight Information Publications.
       2.2.8.1. FAA (NACO) d-TPPs are available at: http://www.naco.faa.gov from any web
       enabled computer. DoD (NGA) d-TPPs are available at https://www.geointel.nga.mil/
       from a computer that can access .mil domains. The d-TPPs from these sites can be used
       in-flight as long as the dates listed on the TPP are valid.
       2.2.8.2. The DoD (NGA) has contracted with Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc. to provide access
       to Jeppesen‘s internet-based worldwide library of aeronautical terminal navigation charts
       and text documents. All members of the DoD may now access this information from any
       web-enabled computer. Guidance regarding the use of non-FAA (NACO), or non-DoD
       (NGA) procedures contained in AFI 11-202 Volume 3 still applies.
2.3. Mission Planning/Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD) Software. If not manually
computed using the flight manual data, mission planning and TOLD computations should be
accomplished using the lead MAJCOM certified software for that MDS aircraft. If certified
software does not exist or is unavailable, other mission planning programs (contractor-
developed, DUATS, Jeppessen, etc.) can be used, but must be verified through manual
calculations using certified data. If an AF approved mission planning system, such as AF
Mission Support System (AFMSS) or Portable Flight Planning Software/Combat Flight Planning
Software (PFPS/CFPS), is used to mission plan, any chart produced will satisfy chart
requirements set forth in this instruction. The flight crew is responsible for ensuring current data
bases (i.e. ECHUM, DAIFF) are loaded and that mission planning data is correctly entered.
2.4. Inflight Publications.
   2.4.1. Carry sufficient maps, charts, and FLIP to navigate for both the planned IFR and VFR
   phases of flight. For local flights, detailed aircrew aids that contain this information are
   sufficient.
   2.4.2. Inflight Manuals/Directives. The Pilot In Command (PIC) will ensure that applicable
   flight manuals, checklists, and mission related directives (if required) for all mission required
   crew positions are carried in flight. The OG/CC will determine required mission directives.
   All applicable technical orders will be carried aboard the aircraft or in the Remotely Piloted
   Aircraft (RPA) control station. If a conventional paper copy of a flight manual and/or
   checklist is not available through distribution or local printing, then two independent
   methods of accessing the electronic flight manual that have been verified to be current and
   operational must be available to the crew.
 12                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


   2.4.2. (EDWARDSAFB) For local sorties, all aircrew will have access to AFI 11-2FT Vol
   3, AFI 11-202 Vol 3, and associated supplements via control room, ops desk or onboard the
   aircraft. For off-station sorties, the aircraft commander will determine applicable inflight
   mission directive requirements.
   2.4.3. Aircraft with inadequate secure inflight publications storage. When mission
   requirements involve flight maneuvers that may create a FOD or safety hazard by the
   abruptness or intensity of maneuvers the OG/CC will specify the minimum required inflight
   publications and FLIP to be carried. However, aircraft checklists must be available for each
   crew position.
   2.4.3. (EDWARDSAFB) Aircraft with inadequate secure inflight publications storage will
   comply with paragraph 2.4.4. of this supplement.
   2.4.4. On local sorties, OG/CCs may authorize aircrew to carry an abbreviated set of
   instrument approach procedures (IAPs) in lieu of carrying the entire FLIP approach plate
   book(s) for the local area. These IAPs must be current and obtained either from the NGA
   website or taken from the current FLIP IAP books. As a minimum, all pertinent approaches
   to the local area divert bases will be included in the abbreviated set of IAPs on board. This
   abbreviated set of approaches will be standardized by the OG/CC and explicitly authorized in
   unit supplements to AFI 11-2FT Vol 3. Procedures to ensure the most current approach
   procedures are included in the abbreviated set will be established and documented by the
   OG/CC.
   2.4.4. (EDWARDSAFB) On local sorties, aircrew are authorized to carry an abbreviated
   set of instrument approach procedures (IAPs) in lieu of carrying the entire FLIP approach
   plate book(s) for the local area. These IAPs must be checked for currency prior to flight and
   obtained either from the NGA or NACO (FAA) websites or copied from the current FLIP
   IAP books. As a minimum, all applicable approaches to Edwards AFB, Palmdale, and China
   Lake will be in the abbreviated set of IAPs on board.
2.5. VFR Low Altitude Charts. Low altitude charts are required for low-level operations.
Charts will be updated from the chart update manual (CHUM) or produced by an approved
mission planning system with a current Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF and
ECHUM). Color reproduced charts are authorized provided it is a quality facsimile of the
original chart containing essential terrain data and features. Aircrew members will supplement
existing mission planning materials (e.g. CHUM, FLIP AP/1B, etc.) with either Sectional
Aeronautical Charts or Air Force approved mission planning software with the following
information printed on the charts used inflight: Airports/Heliports, Airspace Boundaries,
Airways, Military Training Route (MTR), Parachute Jump, and Special Use Airspace (SUA)
Boundaries. Use of Sectional Aeronautical Charts in flight is not required. Note: Helicopter
aircrews conducting controlled burn, firefighting, and search and rescue operations are exempted
from this requirement. If practical, conduct an area survey for obstructions prior to commencing
these operations.
2.5. (EDWARDSAFB)Low Altitude Charts. 412 OSS/OSOA will maintain master charts in
the Base Operations mission planning area that includes the current electronic chart update
manual (ECHUM) and locally surveyed obstructions. Previously undocumented obstructions
observed by 412 OSS/OSAA will be submitted to 412 OG/OGV and published in a Flight Crew
Information File (FCIF).
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                           13


    2.5.1. Required Annotations. Low level charts will contain the following, when applicable:
        2.5.1.1. Location and dimensions of Class B/C/D airspace, civil/military airfields, and
        other potential high density traffic areas (e.g. parachute activity areas, ultra light/hang
        glider/glider sites, etc.) within 5 NM of any planned VFR route or MTR lateral boundary.
        2.5.1.2. Applicable airfield approach control frequencies in the vicinity of Class B, C, or
        D airspace.
        2.5.1.3. The intersection of other Visual Military Training Route/IFR Military Training
        Route (VR/IR) routes and any other possible areas of conflict.
        2.5.1.4. Noise sensitive areas/no-fly areas.
        2.5.1.5. Emergency airfields along the route of flight.
        2.5.1.6. Route abort altitude (RAA) (N/A C-130, see the MDS attachment). Compute
        the RAA for the entire route or area at a minimum of 1,000 feet (500 feet for helicopters
        and tilt-rotor aircraft conducting operations in the CONV/VTOL mode) separation from
        the highest obstacle or terrain feature (rounded to the next highest 100 feet) within the
        lateral limits of the route or training area, but in no case less than 5 NM either side of
        planned route.
        2.5.1.7. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA). For night operations a MSA for each leg of the
        intended route of flight will be computed. The MSA is defined as an altitude of a route
        leg which provides 1,000 feet (500 feet for helicopters and tilt-rotor aircraft conducting
        operations in the CONV/VTOL mode) of clearance above the highest obstacle or terrain
        feature (rounded to the next highest 100 feet) within 5 NM of the planned course, or route
        boundary, whichever is greater. For C-130 specific guidance see this instruction‘s C-130
        attachment.
2.6. Local Area Maps and In-flight Guides. Pilots and navigators will carry a local area map
that depicts special use airspace, alternate airfields, jettison areas, and controlled bailout areas, as
applicable to the aircraft and mission. The local area map is not required if the In-flight Guide is
current and includes this information. Additionally, FLIP enroute charts may be used instead of
maps on IFR navigation flights within areas adequately covered by these charts.
2.6. (EDWARDSAFB)Local Area Maps and Inflight Guides. Pilots and navigators will carry
the 412th Test Wing Inflight Guide (IFG) and 412th Test Wing Local Area Map onboard the
aircraft. Detachments not based in the EDW area will carry IFGs and local area maps applicable
to their area. The 412 OG/OGV will provide IFGs and local area maps to all 412 TW pilots and
navigators. Unit commanders will determine, if required, other mission-related directives to be
carried inflight.
2.7. Local Aircrew Aids. Aircrew aids should be tailored to aid the unit in performing its
mission. Unit aircrew aids may be tailored for each MD as necessary. The following areas are
recommended for inclusion:
    2.7.1. Airfield diagrams.
    2.7.2. Local radio channelization.
    2.7.3. Takeoff and landing data.
 14                                  AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


   2.7.4. Weight and balance data.
   2.7.5. Impoundment procedures.
   2.7.6. Emergency action checklists.
   2.7.7. NORDO procedures.
   2.7.8. Bailout and jettison areas.
   2.7.9. Recovery procedures with weapons onboard and jettison areas.
   2.7.10. Hot brake areas and procedures.
   2.7.11. Divert procedures/alternate and emergency airfield information. Units need to
   document completion of an ORM analysis if using emergency airfields that have runway
   lengths less than that listed in Table 2.1 or in the flight manual for their respective aircraft.
   2.7.12. Cross-country procedures.
   2.7.13. Other information as deemed necessary (e.g. stereo flight plans, turnaround
   procedures, local training areas, instrument preflight, and maintenance brevity codes).
2.8. Test Cards. Flight test cards will be constructed according to local procedures and have
the appropriate level of authorization. A copy of the test cards will be filed at the operations desk
for supervisor reference.
2.8. (EDWARDSAFB)Test Cards. See AFFTCI 99-105, Test Control and Conduct, and
AFFTCI 91-105, AFFTC Test Safety Review Process, for additional test card requirements,
minimum information, approval and test conduct requirements.
   2.8.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Non-test mission cards will be filed at the unit operations
   desk for all training missions. Mission cards will be kept only for the day of the flight.
   Supervisory approval is not required for proficiency/Flight Test Technique (FTT) missions,
   test support missions or TPS syllabus missions. The operations supervisor or representative
   will be briefed on all atypical planned events such as LASDT (Low Altitude Step-Down
   Training) or missions outside the R2508 Complex. Cross-country mission cards will comply
   with the requirements of paragraph 2.20 of this supplement.
   2.8.2. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) The 412 TW has numerous aircraft with extensive Class
   II modifications. All aircrew must review and be familiar with the information contained in
   the Modification Flight Manuals (MFMs) to include Aircraft Operating and Equipment
   Limitations (AOEL) before operating any modified aircraft. Either the MFM or tailored
   aircrew checklist must be carried on board the aircraft when operating Class II equipment.
2.9. Briefing/Debriefing Room Requirements. Briefing rooms will be private and of adequate
size to seat required crewmembers and test team members. They may be multipurpose rooms,
but privacy must be ensured during aircrew mission briefings. Briefing rooms will contain,
electronically or otherwise:

       Check Flight (FCF), jettison, drop zone or salvo areas; and supersonic areas/ranges
       normally used by the unit.
2.10. Briefing/De-briefing.
2.10. (EDWARDSAFB)Briefing/Debriefing. Participating aircrew members will plan and
brief every flight event. Aircraft commanders and flight leaders will brief flight members IAW
the applicable 412 TW briefing guide (412 OG/OGV Sharepoint). Individual flying units may
supplement and tailor the 412 TW briefing guides to cover mission-applicable items as desired.
   2.10.1. Aircraft commanders or flight leaders are responsible for presenting a logical
   briefing that promotes safe, effective mission accomplishment. Use briefing guides to
   provide a reference list of items that may apply to particular missions. Items listed may be
   briefed in any sequence. In addition to requirements specified in AFI 11-202V3 and AFI 11-
   202V3 AFMC Sup. 1, brief crew members from a guide that contains, as a minimum:
       2.10.1.1. Airfield Status and Notice to Airman (NOTAMs).
       2.10.1.2. Radar and visual search responsibilities.
       2.10.1.3. Mid-air collision avoidance.
       2.10.1.4. Interior/exterior aircraft lighting configuration for Night Vision Google (NVG)
       operations (if applicable).
       2.10.1.5. Illumination conditions (moon illumination, depression angle, EENT, cultural
       lighting, etc) for NVG operations (if applicable).
       2.10.1.6. Chase procedures (if required).
       2.10.1.7. When aircraft are flown in formation, proper position (to ensure adequate
       wingtip clearance), responsibilities and aircraft-unique requirements will be briefed for
       each phase of flight.
       2.10.1.8. Altitude Awareness (Warning Systems and Techniques). During the briefing
       for all low-level missions, emphasis will be placed on obstacle/ground avoidance,
       employment of all aircraft altitude warning features, pilot determination of low altitude
16                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


     comfort level, and human factors associated with low altitude flying such as proper task
     prioritization.
     2.10.1.9. Alternate airfields.
     2.10.1.10. Test hazard minimizing procedures/test plan flight restrictions.
     2.10.1.11. Training rules.
     2.10.1.12. Specific mission procedures.
  2.10.2. Standards. Those briefing items understood by all participants may be briefed as
  "standard". Units may use standards as long as they are in a published document. However,
  during sorties where trainees or unassigned personnel are in the flight, all items will be
  briefed.
  2.10.2. (EDWARDSAFB) Standards. Wing briefing standards contained in 412 OG OI 11-
  5 or approved unit briefing standards may be used to expedite the flight brief. If used, all
  members must be familiar with the wing/unit briefing standards.
  2.10.3. All crewmembers and required test support personnel will attend the flight briefing
  unless previously briefed and excused by the aircraft commander.
  2.10.3. (EDWARDSAFB) Personnel not qualified in the aircraft will receive an expanded
  briefing at the aircraft with proper demonstrations including hazards, operating handles and
  switches, emergency procedures and any other information needed to assure flight safety.
  Personnel who fly in AFMC aircraft in which not qualified, at a crew position with a set of
  flight controls, will complete the AFMC A3V Approved Unqualified Personnel ground
  training.
     2.10.3.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Crewmember changes will be made and
     documented IAW AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and associated supplements. When
     a change is required, the replacement crewmember will be adequately briefed, even at the
     expense of a mission delay.
  2.10.4. All aspects of test missions will be thoroughly briefed by the cognizant engineer or
  aircraft commander. Briefings will include actions to terminate the flight test profile if
  required. Each flight will brief an alternate mission, if applicable. The alternate mission
  should be less complex than the primary. Briefed mission elements and events may be
  modified and briefed airborne as long as flight safety is not compromised. Missions or
  events not briefed prior to mission execution will not be flown. Flight leads will ensure
  changes are acknowledged by all flight members.
  2.10.4. (EDWARDSAFB) Unit/squadron commanders will determine flight lead status of
  all qualified pilots. Flight leads (designated on the flight authorization) will brief, lead,
  debrief and be responsible for the safe and efficient conduct of the entire mission. Any event
  not planned and briefed is prohibited. This policy is specifically applicable on test points,
  formation, intercepts and air combat maneuvering/tactics. If another person or aircraft
  instigates any unauthorized events, do not participate and continue with the planned mission
  by the most safe and expedient method.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                      17


   2.10.5. If the flight briefing was conducted prior to the day of the flight, the aircraft
   commander or flight lead will ensure all members are briefed on current and forecast
   weather, NOTAMs, and any mission changes prior to stepping to the aircraft.
   2.10.6. Aircrew will debrief all missions. The debriefing will be conducted in a location
   with suitable tools to accomplish, as a minimum, an evaluation of the mission objectives, test
   objectives, lessons learned, and execution errors. Aircrews should debrief weather
   conditions to weather personnel when weather encountered during the mission was not as
   forecast.
   2.10.6. (EDWARDSAFB) Debriefing. Report unusual mission occurrences or significant
   test events to supervisory personnel as soon as possible. Perform maintenance debrief after
   every mission or ground abort. All test missions will be debriefed by the aircrew and test
   conductor or project engineer, as a minimum.
   2.10.7. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Aircraft commanders/flight leads/mission commanders
   are responsible for aircraft status reporting while operating away from home station. Aircraft
   movement information will be called to the home station duty desk squadron operations
   supervisor during duty hours and to the command post after duty hours.
       2.10.7.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Aircraft movement information will include date,
       mission number, call sign, location, takeoff and landing times (Zulu), flight time, aircraft
       status and grounding write-ups, estimated time of departure, next destination, delays,
       deviations, and aircraft utilization code/mission symbol.
       2.10.7.2. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) If this information is passed to the squadron
       operations supervisor, the operations supervisor will contact the command post and pass
       on the information.
   2.10.8. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) When air refueling is conducted on test missions for the
   sole purpose of extending mission length, and approved air refueling procedures exist,
   routine USAF scheduling and mission briefing practices will be used. If any portion of the
   test involves air-refueling envelope determination or expansion, or air-refueling system
   testing, face-to-face or telephone briefings are required between the tanker aircrew and the
   test team. Additional requirements for air-refueling testing can be found in 412 OG OI 99-1,
   Air Refueling of Test Aircraft.
   2.10.9. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) A general briefing will be given to the squadron
   commander or operations officer before departing to a remote site. Unit Operations section
   responsibilities may be delegated to test teams located at remote sites. Reference
   Attachments 36-40 for additional briefing and procedural requirements for deployed test
   operations.
2.11. Passenger Briefing Guides. On passenger carrying aircraft, passengers will be provided a
pre-printed passenger briefing guide. Use lead MAJCOM briefing guides where appropriate. If
none exist, use the general briefing guide in Attachment 2.
2.12. Bird Avoidance. Generally, the hour before and after sunrise and sunset presents an
increased threat of a bird strike, with migration seasons posing a significant hazard at different
times. Pilots should follow locally developed BASH procedures as well as those outlined in
 18                                 AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


AFPAM 91-212, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Management Techniques, to
minimize aircraft exposure to bird strikes. Additionally:
2.12. (EDWARDSAFB)Bird Avoidance. Pilots will follow locally developed bird aircraft
strike hazard (BASH) procedures outlined in AFFTC BASH Plan 91-202. A copy of this plan
will be maintained at the squadron operations desk. Aircrew will advise the controlling agency
and/or Supervisor of Flying (SOF) of bird activity posing a hazard to flight operations.
   2.12.1. Aircrews operating within the continental U.S. will reference the most current Avian
   Hazard Avoidance System (AHAS) for all low altitude portions of flight, to include takeoff
   and landing, instrument approaches, low level operations, and range operations that occur
   less than 3,000 feet AGL. This information is available at www.usahas.com. Operations at
   bases with established BASH procedures do not require reference to AHAS during takeoff,
   landing, or instrument approaches. Best available AHAS information will be used. If AHAS
   information is not available for the operating location, attempt to use existing bird models to
   mitigate risk.
       2.12.1.1. Flying operations are not restricted when AHAS bird strike risk rating is LOW.
       2.12.1.2. AHAS bird strike risk rating of MODERATE is a warning to all aircrew to
       maintain a vigilant lookout for bird activity, particularly in the low altitude environment.
       Reducing speed and/or minimizing flight below 3,000 feet reduces the risk of bird strike.
       Low altitude, high speed events (low level navigation, air-to-surface weapons delivery,
       TF/TA) events below 3,000 feet will be limited to only those required for syllabus
       training, currency, or for approved flight test events if AHAS predicts or observes
       MODERATE status for the applicable time.
       2.12.1.3. AHAS bird strike risk rating of SEVERE is a warning to aircrew to avoid this
       region. Aircrew will remain above 3,000 feet for all events in regions where the current
       AHAS bird strike risk is reported as SEVERE. All test and test support mission events
       requiring flight below 3,000 feet AGL in areas where the AHAS bird strike risk rating is
       SEVERE require OG/CC or TG/CC approval prior to execution.
   2.12.2. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Additional Bird Hazard Restrictions. Due to the high
   number of birds at NAS Point Mugu, only mission essential flights are authorized to go there.
   Squadron Supervisor approval is required prior to operating at NAS Point Mugu.
2.13. Normal/Minimum/Emergency Landing Fuel. See Table 2.1 Plan to arrive on initial or
downwind, as appropriate for aircraft type, or at the final approach fix with no less than Normal
fuel, and land with no less than Minimum fuel. If it becomes apparent an aircraft will land with
less than Minimum fuel, pilots shall declare minimum fuel with ATC. If it becomes apparent an
aircraft will land with less than the Emergency fuel listed in Table 2.1, pilots shall declare an
emergency with ATC.
   2.13.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Divert Fuel. This fuel state allows for one missed
   approach at the home field and a divert to the nearest available alternate. Aircrew will plan to
   land at the alternate with no lower than minimum fuel.
       2.13.1.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Aircrew will not intentionally go below divert fuel
       with the intention of landing on lake bed runways. Aircrew will divert to an appropriate
       airfield before going below divert fuel. After considering the lake bed status, security,
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                     19


       support issues, etc. the SOF/Unit may seek a waiver to this guidance. 412 OG/CC is the
       approval authority.
2.14. Authorized Fuel Loads. Aircraft will be loaded with fuel according to requirements of
T.O. 1-1B-50, the handbook of weight and balance data, and the MDS specific T.O. 1X-XXX-5-
1. Units may develop alternate fuel loads to support modified aircraft or special mission
requirements. These alternate fuel loads will be documented and approved in a Modification
Flight Manual (MFM) IAW AFI 11-215, Flight Manuals Program, as supplemented.
2.15. Aircraft Movement on the Ground. Takeoffs are restricted to wet runway conditions or
better. Pilots must account for the fact that taxiways and ramps typically have a lower RCR than
reported for the Runway. Refer to the MDS flight and/or performance manual(s), and MDS-
specific attachments to this instruction for further RCR restrictions. OG/CC has authorization to
waive takeoff on runway conditions worse than wet but not to exceed flight and/or performance
manual limits.
2.16. Minimum Runway Lengths. Table 2.1 shows the minimum runway lengths that will be
used for all planned airfield operations. Pilots are encouraged to use the entire runway length
available for takeoff, mission permitting. Aircraft gross weight, performance and weather
conditions may dictate longer runway requirements than the minimum prescribed in Table 2.1.
If there are no explicit requirements outlined in the MD specific attachment, runway available
for landing must exceed total planned landing distance by at least 1,000 feet. If applicable,
inoperative systems (anti-skid, etc.) must be taken into account. For developmental aircraft,
minimum runway length will be described in the aircraft-specific safety package.
   2.16.1. Runway available (Fighter/Attack/Trainer). Unless further guidance is provided in
   this instruction‘s MD specific attachment, do not take off if the computed ground roll
   exceeds 80 percent of the runway available. Do not execute a formation takeoff if the ground
   roll exceeds 50 percent of the runway available.
   2.16.2. Take Off and Landing Data (TOLD) (Fighter/Attack/Trainer). The following will be
   computed (if applicable): acceleration check speed, refusal/maximum abort speed, rotation
   speed, takeoff speed and distance, single engine takeoff speed, normal landing speed and
   distance, heavy weight landing speed, single engine landing speed. All computations should
   take runway condition and the possibility of drag chute failure into account if applicable.
   2.16.3. Intersection Takeoffs (All aircraft). Intersection takeoffs are permitted if the runway
   remaining meets minimum length criteria specified in paragraph 2.16.1, and Table 2.1.

mission procedures are covered in unit OI
   2.21.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Mission Authorization. A cross-country or out-and-back
   mission is any mission that includes a full stop landing at other than Edwards AFB where
   airfield services are required, landing fees are incurred or a change in the crew/passenger
   manifest is made. The aircrew must record requests and approvals of all cross-country and
   out-and-back flights on AFFTC Form 5042, Off-Station Sortie Request. The 412 OG/CC is
   the final approving authority for cross-country and out-and-back flights. 412 MXG/CC will
   be included on all AFFTC Form 5042 requests for coordination/approval. An AFFTC Form
   5042 is not required for a full-stop landing at China Lake, Palmdale, WJ Fox Field, March
   ARB or So Cal Logistics (Victorville). Aircrew will schedule flights through normal
   scheduling channels. Additional cross-country request requirements are:
       2.21.1.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) The request must be submitted to 412 TW
       scheduling IAW AFFTCI 11-15, Scheduling Procedures for Aircraft and Air/Ground
       Support.
       2.21.1.2. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) The aircraft commander will forward any changes
       to the itinerary on the Daily Flight Schedule or AFFTC Form 5042 to 412 OSS/OSOS
       Current Operations (ROC) or Command Post (after hours) before departure from home
       station. The aircraft commander will keep the Command Post advised of all
       arrival/departure changes to enroute stops while aircraft is off station.
   2.21.2. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Mission Planning. The AF 70, Pilot’s Flight Plan and

                                           Chapter 3

                                    MISSION GUIDANCE

3.1. General. This chapter contains guidance that applies to all AFMC aircraft. Guidance that
is airframe specific is contained in this instruction‘s attachments. This chapter is divided into
five sub-sections: Common, Tactical and Systems, Air-to-Air, Air-to-Surface and Low Altitude,
and Flight Test Missions.
   3.1.1. The test and safety review process does not have authority to grant exception to this or
   any other AFI. Nor do they grant exceptions to Technical Orders (T.O.s) or Preliminary
   T.O.s. AFMC/A3 is the approval authority for deviations for Flight Manual T.O.s. See AFI
   11-215 for applicable Flight Manual T.O.s and further guidance.
3.2. Common Mission Operations.
   3.2.1. Local Area Orientation (LAO). LAO flights will occur during the day as defined by
   AFI 11-202 Volume 3. MD specific guidance is provided in this instruction‘s attachments
   where required.
   3.2.2. ILS Precision Runway Monitoring (ILS PRM). AFMC aircrew are prohibited from
   flying ILS approaches requiring PRM unless there is a mission need, and the pilots at the
   controls have accomplished ILS PRM training. MD specific guidance is provided in this
   instruction‘s attachments where required.
   3.2.3. Theater Indoctrination. AFMC flying units conducting flying operations to and from
   deployed locations outside of the CONUS will ensure aircrews are thoroughly trained for
   specific theater operations. MD specific guidance is provided in this instruction‘s
   attachments where required.
   3.2.4. Touch and Go Landings. Touch and Go landings are authorized in AFMC. See
   paragraph 5.25 and MD attachments for specific guidance.
   3.2.5. Approach and Landing. Use reported RCR when computing landing ground roll.
   When the computed landing ground roll exceeds 80 percent of the available runway, land at
   an alternate if possible. In the absence of a reported RCR, land at an alternate, if possible,
   when the base of intended landing has worse than wet runway conditions. For tail-hook
   equipped aircraft, if an alternate is not available, an approach end or mid-field arrestment
   should be considered. Landing on runway with a reported conditions worse than wet runway
   (not to exceed flight and/or performance manual limits) require OG/CC authorization.
3.3. Tactical and Systems Mission Operations.
   3.3.1. Air-to-Air Refueling Tanker. MD specific guidance is provided in this instruction‘s
   attachments where required.
   3.3.2. Air-to-Air Refueling Receiver. Air refueling operations will be conducted in
   accordance with ATP-56(B) and the guidance provided below. Rotary wing and tilt-rotor air
   refueling operations will be in accordance with this instruction‘s MD specific attachments.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                   25


     3.3.2.1. Do not conduct air refueling after known losses of tanker disconnect capability
     (including tanker manual operation without tanker disconnect capability, or manual boom
     latching) unless necessary to recover the aircraft.
     3.3.2.2. Reverse air refueling and manual boom latching procedures training must be
     under direct instructor supervision. Brief procedures used for these events during mission
     planning. In-flight coordination between receiver pilot and boom operator must include
     briefing items as required by applicable air refueling technical orders. Both tanker and
     receiver air refueling system must be fully operable.
     3.3.2.3. Do not accomplish practice emergency separation training from the contact
     position or boom limit demonstration unless the receiver signal system is in normal and
     the receiver and tanker have assured normal disconnect capability prior to initiating the
     maneuver. Tanker disconnect capability will not be verified on the same contact as the
     practice emergency separation, and will be verified with each receiver that accomplishes
     a practice emergency separation.
     3.3.2.4. For practice emergency separation training, coordination between the tanker
     pilot, boom operator and the receiver pilot is mandatory and will occur prior to the event.
     In-flight coordination must include when the maneuver will occur and who will give the
     command of execution. Tanker pilot coordination with the boom operator may be
     accomplished over interphone.
     3.3.2.5. For boom envelope demonstrations, the receiver pilot and the boom operator will
     discuss the maneuver prior to accomplishment. In-flight coordination must include the
     receiver pilot informing the boom operator when commencing the demonstration, the
     limit to be demonstrated, and when terminating the demonstration. Tanker disconnect
     capability must be verified by a boom operator initiated disconnect prior to receivers
     conducting limits demonstrations.
     3.3.2.6. NVGs may be worn for night tanker rejoins to include flying in the observation
     position, but will be raised to the up and stowed position or removed prior to the pre-
     contact position. Goggles may be returned to the ―on‖ position post-AAR, if not in the
     pre-contact or contact position. In all cases, pilots will assess tanker external lighting
     conditions to determine if using NVGs is appropriate.
  3.3.3. Functional and Acceptance Check Flight (FCF/ACF).
     3.3.3.1. FCFs and ACFs will be performed according to T.O. 1-1-300, T.O. 1X-XX-
     6CF-1, T.O. 1X-XX-1 Flight Manual and associated Partial/Modification Flight Manuals
     and applicable AFMC instructions. FCFs following programmed depot maintenance
     (PDM) will also follow the current work specification. In the absence of an applicable
     T.O. 1X-XX-6CF-1, AFMC/LG will develop FCF and maintenance action guidance for
     that aircraft. FCFs for other reasons, such as major aircraft repair, modification, or
     extended aircraft downtime (as defined by T.O. 1X-XX -6CF-1) can be tailored. The
     FCF aircrew, aircraft maintenance and sustaining engineering activity will determine
     which FCF procedures will be accomplished. An FCF or ACF using the O-8E mission
     symbol are aircraft defined as non-airworthy in accordance with T.O. 1-1-300 and are
     subject to all applicable restrictions. Systems affecting airworthy status are engines,
     flight controls, landing gear and instruments affecting instrument flight (IFR) capability.
 26                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


      All other FCF and ACF flights may use the O-8F mission symbol and follow the
      restrictions associated with that mission.
      3.3.3.2. Modified aircraft. When an aircraft has original equipment modified or new
      equipment added that is not covered by USAF technical orders, the contractor or
      responsible test organization will provide ACF/FCF or airworthiness procedures. The
      need for FCF after a T-2 modification will be determined by the aircraft maintenance
      activity. These procedures will augment those already defined in the T.O. 1X-XX-6CF-
      1. Conduct of the first flight after a major T-2 modification requiring verification of
      system airworthiness will be part of an approved test plan. The aircraft manufacturer or
      contractor will define FCF procedures for developmental aircraft.
      3.3.3.3. Tail hook equipped aircraft. Initial FCF (O-8E) flights will be conducted from a
      runway with compatible approach and departure end cables or barriers. Specific cable
      and barrier configuration for the runway will be determined by local guidance. If no such
      runway is available, then an initial FCF may still be accomplished if there is a suitable
      alternate airfield with compatible cables within 50 nautical miles and recovery fuel
      allows for the possible divert. The weather at the alternate airfield must meet FCF
      requirements.
      3.3.3.4. Use of Check Flight Cards. Unit developed check flight cards may be used in
      lieu of the T.O. 1X-XX-6CF-1checklist provided they are derived from the applicable
      T.O. 1X-XX-6CF-1 checklist and are approved by the OG/CC.
      3.3.3.5. Flight Conditions. Comply with restrictions published in T.O. 1-1-300 and the
      take-off weather minimums specified in Table 3.1. Preflight inspections for ACF/FCF
      flights will be accomplished during daylight hours. Additionally, the initial preflight
      inspection will not be conducted during periods of precipitation to prevent masking fluid
      leaks. All daylight-required flight operations must be terminated prior to official sunset.
      3.3.3.6. Waivers. On a case-by-case basis, when operational requirements demand, and
      within the constraints specified in T.O. 1-1-300, flying wing commanders (or equivalent)
      may waive these night and weather restrictions for all types and models of AFMC
      assigned aircraft. Document approval on the flight authorization. For units without flying
      wing commanders, HQ AFMC/A3V is the waiver authority.

      3.3.3.7. Combined FCF and ACF Flights. IAW T.O. 1-1-300, flying wing commanders
      (or equivalent) may authorize the combination of FCFs with other mission/training flights
      if the FCF is being conducted to evaluate auxiliary aircraft systems. For units without
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                   27


     flying wing commanders, HQ AFMC/A3V is the waiver authority. The decision to
     approve a combined FCF and ferry flight is the responsibility of AFMC/A3V.
     3.3.3.8. Aircraft Release. If a malfunction occurs during an FCF, which is not related to
     the condition generating the FCF, and the original condition operationally checks good,
     the aircraft may be released for flight pending resolution of the new malfunction. This
     does not apply to post PDM FCFs.
  3.3.4. Advanced Handling Characteristics/Advanced Handling Maneuvers (AHC/AHM).
  AHC and AHM maneuver definitions are provided in AFTTP 3-3 v MDS. Further MD
  specific guidance is provided in this instruction‘s attachments where required.
  3.3.5. Fighter/Trainer Formation and Flight Lead. These procedures apply to all fighter,
  attack and trainer aircraft. For all other aircraft, refer to MD specific attachments to this
  instruction. Formations and sub-elements will be led by a qualified flight lead. In all cases,
  wingmen are responsible for deconfliction unless otherwise briefed.
     3.3.5.1. Formation Definitions. Formation definitions are in accordance with AFTTP 3-
     3.MDS or as briefed. Formation positions for dissimilar formations must be briefed by
     the flight lead.
     3.3.5.2. Taxi.
         3.3.5.2.1. Day. Minimum taxi interval is 150 feet if taxiing staggered, 300 feet if
         taxiing in trail (on the taxiway centerline). Spacing may be reduced when holding
         short of or entering the runway.
         3.3.5.2.2. Night. Minimum taxi interval is 300 feet, and the aircraft will taxi on the
         taxiway centerline.
         3.3.5.2.3. Runway/Taxiways with ice/snow/slush. Minimum taxi interval is 300 feet,
         and the aircraft will taxi on the taxiway centerline.
         3.3.5.2.4. Do not taxi in front of aircraft being armed/de-armed with forward firing
         ordnance.
         3.3.5.2.5. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Ground Abort. When a flight leader/wing
         aircraft aborts before takeoff, the remaining aircraft are authorized to fly if an
         alternate mission was pre-briefed/approved or the unit commander directs an alternate
         mission.
     3.3.5.3. Takeoff.
         3.3.5.3.1. Takeoff interval between aircraft or elements will be a minimum of 10
         seconds. Fifteen seconds is the minimum separation when the previous aircraft uses
         afterburner. When executing a trail departure, in anticipation of a rejoin above the
         weather, the minimum takeoff interval will be 20 seconds. When the previous
         aircraft is carrying live or inert air-to-surface weapons, the minimum takeoff interval
         will be 20 seconds.
         3.3.5.3.2. Flight lead will brief runway lineup and abort procedures. Flight lead will
         call for brake release over the radio during night formation takeoffs if approved, see
         paragraph
28                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


        3.3.5.3.3. Wingmen will be positioned on the upwind side of the runway when
        crosswinds are greater than 5 knots. Minimum wingtip clearance will be 10 feet.
        Spacing between separated elements or flights on the runway must be at least 500
        feet.
        3.3.5.3.4. Formation takeoffs are restricted to elements of two like (same model and
        design) aircraft. Aircraft must be symmetrically configured if carrying air-to-surface
        ordnance and/or fuel tanks, and loaded such that a trim or control application to
        counter a heavy wing or yaw during takeoff is not required.
            3.3.5.3.4.1. The runway must be at least 125 feet wide (140 feet A-10).
            3.3.5.3.4.2. Ceiling and visibility must be at least 500 feet and 1 1/2 miles.
            3.3.5.3.4.3. Formation takeoffs are prohibited if: slush, snow, ice, or standing
            water is on the runway; effective crosswind component or crosswind gust exceeds
            15 knots or flight manual limits, whichever is lower; the computed takeoff roll
            exceeds 50% of the available runway; aircraft are loaded with live or inert full
            scale munitions (excluding air-to-air missiles and internal gun ammunition, or
            practice bombs).
            3.3.5.3.4.4. Night formation takeoffs are prohibited unless waived for mission
            requirements by the OG/CC.
     3.3.5.4. Rejoins.
        3.3.5.4.1. Daytime. Weather minimums for rejoin underneath a ceiling are 1,000 feet
        and 3 miles visibility.
        3.3.5.4.2. Night. Weather minimums for rejoin underneath a ceiling are 3,000 feet
        and 3 miles. During the rejoin, wingmen remain at least 1,000 feet AGL. The last
        aircraft will keep the anti-collision beacon and/or strobe on and position lights on
        unless otherwise directed by the flight lead.
     3.3.5.5. Trail Departures. Trail departures can be unaided or aided. Unaided trail
     departures rely primarily on timing for separation. Aided trail departures rely on timing
     and air-to-air radar, or data link information to maintain separation. The term ―tied‖
     refers to aircrew that have achieved situational awareness on the preceding aircraft via
     air-to-air radar or data link information. The desired aircraft separation for all trail
     departures is 2-3 NM.
        3.3.5.5.1. Takeoff spacing will be a minimum of 20 seconds. The flight lead must
        brief the initial power setting for takeoff and acceleration, climb power setting and
        airspeed, and level off airspeed.
        3.3.5.5.2. Each aircraft (or element) will maintain 20 seconds, or 2-3 NM spacing
        using all applicable aircraft systems and navigational aids. Make all heading changes
        IAW standard instrument procedures not to exceed 30 degree of bank.
        3.3.5.5.3. On departure, each aircraft (or element) will follow the No Radar Contact
        procedures until all aircraft/elements have called ―tied.‖
        3.3.5.5.4. Radar equipped aircraft (or elements) will call "tied" when radar contact is
        established with the preceding aircraft. Alternatively, aircraft equipped with a data
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                     29


        link system that can display the relative position of the preceding aircraft will call
        ―tied‖ when airborne with a valid data link. No further radio calls are required once
        all aircraft are "tied" unless contact is lost.
        3.3.5.5.5. Each aircraft (or element) will maintain at least 1,000 feet vertical
        separation from the preceding aircraft during climbs, descents, and at level-off until
        ―tied‖ with the preceding aircraft, except in instances where departure instructions
        specifically preclude compliance.
        3.3.5.5.6. In the event a visual join-up cannot be accomplished on top or at level-off,
        the flight lead will request 1,000 feet of altitude separation for each succeeding
        aircraft (or element) that is not ―tied‖ providing all aircraft can comply with MSA
        restrictions. If the MSA cannot be complied with, vertical separation may be reduced
        to 500 feet. The flight lead should request IFF squawks for wingmen that must
        remain in trail.
        3.3.5.5.7. Do not sacrifice basic instrument flying when performing secondary trail
        tasks during trail departures. Strictly adhere to the briefed climb speeds, power
        settings, altitudes, headings, and turn points. First priority must be given to flying the
        aircraft, not operating the radar or data link. If task saturation occurs, cease attempts
        to maintain trail, immediately concentrate on flying the instrument departure, and
        notify the flight lead.
        3.3.5.5.8. No Radar Contact Procedures. When an aircrew losses, or cannot gain
        situational awareness on the preceding aircraft (or element) via air-to-air radar or data
        link information the following procedures apply.
            3.3.5.5.8.1. The flight lead will call initiating all turns and descents and passing
            each 5,000 feet altitude increment with altitude and heading until join-up, level-
            off or the non-―tied‖ aircraft calls ―tied.‖
            3.3.5.5.8.2. During climbs and descents, the aircraft (element) immediately
            preceding the aircraft that is not ―tied‖ will call passing each 5,000 foot altitude
            increment with altitude and heading until join-up, level-off or the following
            aircraft (element) calls ―tied.‖ In addition, the aircraft immediately preceding the
            aircraft that is not tied will call initiating any altitude or heading change.
            Acknowledgments are not required.
     3.3.5.6. Enroute Procedures and Working Area Operations.
        3.3.5.6.1. Do not use exaggerated or rolling maneuvers to maintain or regain
        formation position below 5,000 ft. AGL or in airspace where aerobatics are
        prohibited.
        3.3.5.6.2. In IMC, maximum flight size in close formation is four aircraft except
        when flying in formation with a tanker. Follow the guidance in ATP-56(B) when
        flying in formation with a tanker.
        3.3.5.6.3. For rejoins from tactical formations, the wingman will join to the side of
        the formation occupied at the time the rejoin is directed. If in trail, join to the left
        side. In all cases, the trailing element will join to the side opposite the number two,
        unless otherwise directed.
30                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


        3.3.5.6.4. Loss of Visual. If a flight member loses sight of his flight leader or other
        flight member at a time when he or she thinks they should be in sight, a "blind" call
        will be made. Losing sight during some types of tactical maneuvering is predictable,
        but reacquiring sight at the appropriate time is also predictable. When any flight
        member calls "blind," the other flight member will immediately respond with "visual"
        and a position report. When the other flight member is also "blind", the flight leader
        will take action to ensure altitude separation between flight members.
     3.3.5.6.5. Three and Four-Ship Formations (or more). When flights of more than two
     aircraft are in tactical formation:
            3.3.5.6.5.1. Formation visual signals performed by a flight/element leader pertain
            only to the associated element unless specified otherwise by the flight leader.
            3.3.5.6.5.2. Trailing aircraft/element will maintain a sufficient distance back so
            that primary emphasis during formation maneuvering is on low altitude awareness
            and de-confliction within elements, not on de-confliction between elements.
        3.3.5.6.6. Dissimilar Formation. Aircrew members in dissimilar formations must be
        knowledgeable of the procedures, visual references and limitations of the other
        aircraft types in the formation as required by the mission.
        3.3.5.6.7. Ops Checks. Increase the frequency of ops checks during tactical
        maneuvering at high power settings. Ops checks should include but aren‘t limited to
        fuel status, instruments, engines, and life support systems.
     3.3.5.7. Position Changes.
        3.3.5.7.1. Day VMC. The minimum altitude for position changes within a formation
        is 500 feet AGL over land or 1,000 feet AGL over water, except for emergencies.
        3.3.5.7.2. Night or IMC. The minimum altitude for position changes within a
        formation is 1,500 feet AGL, unless established on radar downwind. A radio call is
        mandatory when directing position changes at night or in IMC.
        3.3.5.7.3. Do not initiate lead changes with the wingman further aft of normal
        fingertip, route, or greater than 30 degrees back from line abreast.
     3.3.5.8. Formation Breakup. Formation breakup must be thoroughly briefed. Flight
     leads will maintain positive control and when necessary, issue instructions to ensure safe
     separation of participating aircraft.
        3.3.5.8.1. Flight leaders will not break up formations until each pilot has a positive
        fix from which to navigate (visual, ATC, INS, TACAN, VOR, or other suitable
        system waypoint). Formation break-up should not be accomplished in IMC. If
        unavoidable, IMC break-up will be accomplished in straight and level flight. Prior to
        an IMC break-up, the flight lead will confirm position and transmit attitude, altitude,
        airspeed, and altimeter setting. Wingmen will acknowledge and confirm good
        navigational aids. During formation breakups (under VMC or IMC), the flight lead
        will clear off aircraft and elements individually. Departing aircraft will initially turn
        away from the formation and, in VMC conditions, establish visual contact with
        previously departing aircraft.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                   31


        3.3.5.8.1. (EDWARDSAFB) Flight Breakup. As a guide, the flight/element lead
        will not consider the formation split up until the departing element/aircraft has turned
        to a divergent vector with 6,000 feet horizontal or 1,000 feet vertical separation and
        the separation can be maintained.
        3.3.5.8.2. VMC drags on final below the weather are authorized if coordinated with
        ATC, the weather is at least 1500 ft and 3 NM, and the drag is accomplished in
        sufficient time that the trail formation is set, and all aircraft are configured for
        landing, prior to the FAF (in the case of an instrument approach), or 3 nm from the
        landing point (in the case of a visual approach). Minimum airspeed for any aircraft
        during the maneuver will be final approach speed.
     3.3.5.9. Overhead Traffic Patterns.
        3.3.5.9.1. Overhead patterns can be made with unexpended practice ordnance (e.g.,
        BDU-33s) and live forward firing ordnance. Overhead traffic patterns will not be
        flown with live or inert unexpended air-to-surface ordnance, unless that ordnance is
        secure and within an internal weapons bay. Normal spacing between overhead breaks
        will be 5 seconds. Aircraft must be wings level on final at approximately 300 feet
        AGL and 1 mile from the planned touchdown point.
        3.3.5.9.2. After landing clear aircraft to the exit side (cold side) of the runway when
        speed and conditions permit.
     3.3.5.10. Formation Penetration and Approaches. Formation penetrations are restricted
     to two aircraft when the weather at the base of intended approach or landing is less than
     overhead traffic pattern minimums. Ceiling and visibility must be at least 500 feet and 1
     1/2 miles. If flying a formation landing, the wingman should be positioned on the
     appropriate wing prior to weather penetration. Formation low approaches may be flown
     with dissimilar aircraft. Approach airspeed will be based on the higher approach speed of
     the two aircraft. Minimum altitude for formation low approaches is 100 feet during the
     day and 300 feet at night.
     3.3.5.11. Formation Landings.
        3.3.5.11.1. Normally accomplish formation landings from a precision approach,
        when available. If not available, the rate of descent should be similar to a normal
        precision approach.
        3.3.5.11.2. Landing. When briefing formation landings, flight leads will brief missed
        approach and go-around procedures. Wingmen will be positioned on the upwind side
        of the formation when crosswinds are greater then 5 knots. Minimum wingtip
        clearance will be 10 feet.
        3.3.5.11.3. Formation landings are restricted to elements of two like (same model and
        design) aircraft. Aircraft must be symmetrically configured with air-to-surface
        ordnance and/or fuel tanks, and loaded such that a trim or control application to
        counter a heavy wing or yaw during landing is not required. The runway must be at
        least 125 feet wide (140 feet A-10). Ceiling and visibility must be at least 500 feet
        and 1 1/2 miles.
        3.3.5.11.4. Formation landings are prohibited if:
32                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


            3.3.5.11.4.1. The runway is reported as ―wet‖ and/or measured RCR is at or
            below 18 (or ice, slush, or snow is on the runway).
            3.3.5.11.4.2. Effective crosswind component or crosswind gust exceeds 15 knots
            or flight manual limits, whichever is lower.
            3.3.5.11.4.3. Night conditions exist.
            3.3.5.11.4.4. Either aircraft has hung ordnance.
            3.3.5.11.4.5. Loaded with live or inert full scale munitions (excluding air-to-air
            missiles, or internal gun ammunition, or practice bombs).
            3.3.5.11.4.6. Arresting gear tape connectors extend onto the runway surface at the
            approach end of 125-feet-wide runways.
        3.3.5.11.5. Touch-and-go formation landings are prohibited.
        3.3.5.11.6. Pilots will maintain their respective landing side of the runway until both
        aircraft have decelerated to a safe taxi speed.
     3.3.5.12. Trail Recovery. Trail recoveries are authorized for air-to-air radar and data link
     equipped aircraft that are capable of using these systems for formation position keeping.
     For all other aircraft, trail recoveries are authorized only if procedures are established in
     the applicable MD attachment.
        3.3.5.12.1. ATC approval is required to fly a trail recovery. Flight leads must advise
        ATC of intentions to conduct non-standard formation. Flight leads must ensure that
        ATC understands that instructions to the lead aircraft will be for the entire flight, and
        ATC will provide radar flight following for the entire formation.
        3.3.5.12.2. Trail recoveries are limited to a maximum of four aircraft. Prior to taking
        spacing the flight lead will ensure the requirements for formation breakup are
        accomplished. Complete any formation changes to effect trail recovery positions
        prior to the instrument approach Final Approach Fix (FAF).
        3.3.5.12.3. Use pre-briefed airspeeds, geometry, radar, radio calls, etc. to effect the
        formation change and maintain flight members‘ situational awareness. Pilots will fly
        no slower than computed final approach speed to accomplish the spacing maneuver.
        Minimum spacing between flight members is 1 NM.
        3.3.5.12.4. If radar contact, or data link situational awareness is lost with the
        preceding aircraft, the pilot will transmit "(Callsign) lost contact." The preceding
        aircraft will respond with altitude, airspeed and heading. Establish altitude de-
        confliction, if necessary, and coordinate a separate clearance with ATC. If contact is
        lost while established on a segment of a published approach, flight members may
        continue the approach, but must confirm separation via navigation aids. If separation
        cannot be confirmed, execute missed approach or climb-out as instructed by ATC.
        3.3.5.12.5. Once established on a segment of a published approach, each aircraft
        must comply with all published altitudes and restrictions while maintaining in-trail
        separation. All aircraft must report the final approach fix.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                  33


        3.3.5.12.6. Trail recoveries will not terminate in simultaneous Precision Approach
        Radar (PAR) or Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) approaches. Recoveries to
        separate PAR/ASRs are authorized. Flight leads will coordinate with ATC and will
        split prior to PAR/ASR final.
     3.3.5.13. Lost Wingman Procedures. In any lost wingman situation, immediate
     separation of aircraft is essential. Smooth application of control inputs is imperative to
     minimize the effects of spatial disorientation. Upon losing sight of the leader, the
     wingman will simultaneously execute the applicable lost wingman procedures and
     transition to instruments. The flight leader will acknowledge the lost wingman's radio
     call. Transmit attitude, heading, altitude, airspeed, and other parameters as appropriate.
     Permission to rejoin the flight must be obtained from the flight leader after lost wingman
     procedures have been executed.
        3.3.5.13.1. Two or Three Ship Flights (NOTE: If in 3-ship echelon, refer to 4-ship
        lost wingman procedures.):
            3.3.5.13.1.1. Wings-Level Flight (Climb, Descent, or Straight and Level).
            Simultaneously inform the leader and turn away using 15 degrees of bank for 15
            seconds; then resume heading and obtain a separate clearance.
            3.3.5.13.1.2. Turns (Climb, Descent, or Level):
                3.3.5.13.1.2.1. Outside the Turn. Reverse the direction of turn using 15
                degrees of bank for 15 seconds and inform leader. Continue straight ahead to
                ensure separation before resuming turn. Obtain a separate clearance.
                3.3.5.13.1.2.2. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-to-
                tail clearance and inform the leader to roll out of the turn. Maintain angle of
                bank to ensure lateral separation and obtain a separate clearance. The leader
                may resume turn only when separation is ensured.
            3.3.5.13.1.3. Precision and Non-precision Final Approach. The wingman will
            momentarily turn away to ensure separation and inform leader. Commence the
            published missed approach procedure and obtain a separate clearance from
            approach control.
            3.3.5.13.1.4. Missed Approach. The wingman will momentarily turn away to
            ensure clearance and inform leader. Continue the published missed approach
            procedure and climb to 500 feet above missed approach altitude. Obtain a
            separate clearance from approach control.
        3.3.5.13.2. Four Ship Flights. The number two and three aircraft will follow the
        procedures outlined above. Number four aircraft will follow the appropriate
        procedures listed below:
            3.3.5.13.2.1. Wings-Level Flight. Simultaneously inform the leader and turn
            away using 30 degrees of bank for 30 seconds. Resume heading and obtain a
            separate clearance.
            3.3.5.13.2.2. Turns:
                3.3.5.13.2.2.1. Outside The Turn. Reverse the direction of the turn using 30
34                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


                 degrees of bank for 30 seconds to ensure separation from lead and number
                 three aircraft. Obtain a separate clearance.
                 3.3.5.13.2.2.2. Inside The Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-
                 to-tail separation and increase bank angle by 15 degrees. Inform the leader to
                 roll out of the turn. Obtain a separate clearance.
     3.3.5.14. Severe Weather Penetration. Avoid flight through severe weather. If
     unavoidable, flights should break-up and obtain separate clearances prior to severe
     weather penetration.
  3.3.6. Targeting Pod (TGP) Pilot. MD specific guidance is provided in this instruction‘s
  attachments where required.
  3.3.7. Navigation Pod (Fighter Only). MD specific guidance is provided in this instruction‘s
  attachments where required.
  3.3.8. Night Vision Goggle (NVG). Pilots must not become overly confident in the
  capabilities of NVGs. Many things can cause a pilot to lose outside visual references. Some
  examples are entering the weather (intentionally or inadvertently), NVG battery failure, flight
  into smoke or dust, flight into a shadowed area, sudden illumination of an incompatible light
  source inside or outside of the cockpit, etc. Pilots must ensure primary and secondary flight
  instruments are sufficiently illuminated to allow transition to instruments if outside visual
  references are lost.
     3.3.8.1. NVGs must be preflight tested and focused for the individual aircrew using (in
     order of preference) the Hoffman ANV-20/20 Tester, a unit eye lane, or equivalent tester
     prior to NVG operations. See AFI 11-301 Volume 1, for specific procedures.
     3.3.8.1. (EDWARDSAFB) NVGs intended for flight operations must be capable of
     being focused to no less than 20/45 acuity for each eye. NVGs not meeting this
     requirement will be inspected and serviced by a qualified NVG Life Support
     Representative.
     3.3.8.2. Use of NVGs during all takeoffs and landings are prohibited, unless authorized
     in the MD specific attachments.
     3.3.8.3. NVGs will only be worn in-flight by NVG qualified aircrew or by upgrading
     aircrew under the supervision of a qualified NVG Instructor. Familiarization flights are
     authorized under the supervision of an NVG IP if appropriate ground training has been
     accomplished.
     3.3.8.4. Goggles will be donned above the MSA and in level to climbing flight when
     possible. The NVGs will be removed a minimum of 5 minutes prior to landing, while
     above the MSA when possible, to allow enough time to regain adequate visual acuity to
     perform the approach and landing.
  3.3.8.5. While conducting NVG formation procedures, the flight lead will brief when each
  flight member will don/doff their goggles. In single seat aircraft, only one flight member at a
  time will don goggles; other flight members will monitor the goggling member if able. In
  multi-seat aircraft, only one crew member at a time will don goggles; another crew member
  will monitor aircraft parameters if able. A ―goggles on‖ or ―goggles off‖ call will be made
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                     35


   indicating the status of the aircrew in each aircraft. Wingman will fly no closer than route
   position while wearing NVGs.
       3.3.8.6. NVGs will only be used in VMC with a discernable horizon. Flight leads or
       aircraft commanders (as appropriate) must brief a non-NVG plan to execute if flight
       conditions degrade.
       3.3.8.7. (N/A C-130 and C-17. See the MDS attachment) The minimum altitude, when
       flying below the MSA and using only NVGs to clear terrain and obstacles, is 1,000 feet
       AGL. Flight below the MSA while using NVGs only, requires high illumination
       conditions, as defined by AFI 11-214. If another system, such as TF/TA, is used to clear
       terrain and obstacles the minimum altitude is defined by that system‘s capability.
       3.3.8.8. Fly with NVGs only in production NVG compatible cockpits, or with a system
       described in the aircraft MFM, or as stipulated in an approved test plan. Aircrew must
       ensure that all control and performance instruments are sufficiently illuminated by an
       NVG compatible light source. Lighting must provide for immediate reference to the
       aircrew in the event they need to transition to instruments with loss of visual references.
       3.3.8.9. All NVG incompatible interior light sources will be suppressed so that they do
       not degrade the aircrew‘s ability to see outside of the cockpit with NVGs. If an
       incompatible light source cannot be suppressed, pilots will terminate NVG operations.
       3.3.8.10. During in-flight emergencies, NVGs may be retained unless they become a
       detriment to safely recovering the aircraft. In ejection seat equipped aircraft, NVGs will
       be removed and stowed as soon as an emergency begins to deteriorate into an ejection
       situation.
   3.3.9. Helmet-Mounted Cueing System Guidance (HMCS).               MD specific guidance is
   provided in this instruction‘s attachments where required.
   3.3.10. HARM Targeting System (HTS).            MD specific guidance is provided in this
   instruction‘s attachments where required.
3.4. Air-to-Air Operations. This section applies to Intercept, Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM),
Low Altitude Training (LOWAT), and Air Combat Training (ACBT). ACBT includes both Air
Combat Maneuvering (ACM) and Air Combat Tactics (ACT). AFMC invokes AFI 11-214 Air-
to-Air training rules for air-to-air training missions with the additional restrictions detailed
below. Developmental air-to-air testing will be conducted in accordance with test and safety
review board guidance and may include AFI 11-214 training rules as appropriate.
   3.4.1. Air-to-Air (A/A) Maneuvering restrictions. Intercept qualified aircrew can conduct
   intercepts in accordance with limited maneuvering training rules. Intercept and BFM
   qualified aircrew can conduct intercepts to unlimited maneuvering, in a 1 V 1 sortie, if both
   pilots are intercept and BFM qualified. Unlimited maneuvering, on sorties greater than 1 V 1
   (e.g., 2 V 1, 2 V 2), requires an ACBT qualification. Flights can be made up of ACBT and
   Intercept qualified crews; however, special attention must be paid to AFI 11-214
   maneuvering limitations.
       3.4.1.1. Negative G guns jinks are prohibited.
   3.4.2. Air-to-Air System Checks. Wingmen may complete their A/A system check during
   formation rejoins. Flight leads will strive to conduct A/A system checks within special use
 36                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


   airspace. If this is not possible, flight leads will do their A/A system checks above 10,000
   feet MSL.
   3.4.3. Separation of Aircraft. Do not maneuver within 1,000 feet of an opposing aircraft
   during air-to-air engagements.
   3.4.4. Simulated Gun Employment. To prevent inadvertent firings when simulating gun
   employment, ensure there is no ammunition loaded or safe the gun according to –34 Series
   T.O.s, and comply with AFTTP 3-3 v MDS specific attachment guidance or AFI 11-2MDS
   Volume 3 guidance. Perform a trigger check (trigger squeeze) before simulated gun
   employment.
   3.4.5. Maximum sortie and engagement size. Maximum sortie size is 4 V 4 for unlimited or
   limited maneuvering. Maximum visual engagement size is 4 aircraft. OG/CC‘s may
   approve participation in larger exercises on a case by case basis. Non-radar equipped aircraft
   are restricted to limited maneuvering in visual engagements larger than 2 V 1.
   3.4.6. Battle Damage/Bomb Checks. Unless circumstances prevent, flight leads will direct a
   battle damage/bomb check prior to or during RTB. Formation spacing will be no closer than
   normal fingertip.
3.5. Air-to-Surface Weapons Delivery, Air Drop and/or Low Altitude.
   3.5.1. Air-to-Surface Weapons Delivery. This section describes procedures for aircrew air-
   to-surface operations and is applicable to all AFMC aircraft. Weapons delivery operations
   will be IAW AFI 13-212, Volume 1, Range Planning and Operations, T.O. 1M-34, Aircraft
   Weapons Delivery Manual, and aircraft specific -34 T.O.s. AFMC invokes AFI 11-214 Air-
   to-Surface training rules for air-to-surface training missions with the additional restrictions
   detailed below. Developmental air-to-surface testing will be conducted in accordance with
   test and safety review board guidance and may include AFI 11-214 training rules as
   appropriate. Unless otherwise specified, all limits for tilt-rotor aircraft in APLN mode equal
   those cited for fixed wing aircraft. Tilt-rotor aircraft operating in CONV or VTOL mode are
   equal to those cited for helicopters.
      3.5.1.1. Weapons Delivery Target Identification. Aircrew must positively identify the
      target and ensure correlation with the targeting system prior to weapons release. For
      example, a pilot may visually identify a target, but must ensure the sensor controlling the
      point of impact (targeting pod, radar, etc) will direct the weapon to the identified target.
      When delivering weapons via an INS and/or GPS solution (through an undercast, in IMC,
      at night, etc) target identification, and correlation is defined as verifying the target
      coordinates and navigation solution validity respectively, while airborne.
      3.5.1.2. Weather Minimums. IMC deliveries or a VMC delivery through an undercast
      will be conducted in accordance with the applicable range rules. VMC level deliveries
      above 5,000 AGL feet with visual contact with the ground will be conducted in
      accordance with the applicable range rules.
      3.5.1.3. Single Ship Operations. AFMC aircrew, qualified in air-to-ground employment,
      may fly single ship weapon employment missions with training or simulated ordnance.
      3.5.1.4. Minimum Altitudes. Minimum release and recovery altitudes are specified in
      AFI 11-214 and Table 3.2.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                     37

Nuclear and Radar Events      Level ±2.5 degrees       200 ft
      3.5.1.5. Flight Composition. Dissimilar aircraft may execute deliveries on the same
      range provided the delivery events are compatible with each type of aircraft and AFI 11-
      214 delivery spacing restrictions are followed.
      3.5.1.6. Live Ordnance Procedures.
          3.5.1.6.1. Conduct a thorough and complete verification of all target data.
          3.5.1.6.2. No release system, indicator, or weapon bay door malfunction may exist.
          3.5.1.6.3. Weapon Unlock/Release Enable/Master Arm to Arm will not be completed
          until the aircraft is within the designated bombing range.
          3.5.1.6.4. If all weapons are expended and release is verified visually (pilot
          observation of impact, by the Range Control Officer, or other flight members) and
          internal indications are consistent with outside observations, aircrews may conduct
          additional training without restriction.
          3.5.1.6.5. Do not make simulated weapon delivery passes on targets occupied by
          personnel.
      3.5.1.7. Class B/C Ranges. When Ground Controllers are operating on Class B/C ranges
      the following procedures apply:
          3.5.1.7.1. All pilots will be familiar with applicable range weapons delivery
          procedures, appropriate targets and weapons footprints.
          3.5.1.7.2. Ground personnel locations will be briefed and acknowledged by all pilots.
          3.5.1.7.3. Pilots will not expend ordnance if any doubt exists as to the ground
          personnel or intended target locations.
38                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


     3.5.1.8. Battle Damage/Bomb Checks (Fighter/Attack/Trainer). Unless circumstances
     prevent, flight leads will direct a battle damage/bomb check prior to or during recovery to
     base. This check is mandatory following the expenditure of live ordnance including all
     types of gun ammunition. Formation spacing will be no closer than normal fingertip.
     Battle damage checks are not required during night or IMC, however they may be
     accomplished at night if wearing NVGs.
     3.5.1.9. Armament System Malfunctions. Aircrew will not attempt to expend ordnance
     using a delivery system with a known weapons release malfunction unless following
     hung ordnance procedures.
     3.5.1.10. Inadvertent Release. Record switch positions and impact point (if known) at the
     time of inadvertent release and provide to armament and safety personnel. Check
     armament switches safe and do not attempt further release in any mode. Treat remaining
     stores as hung ordnance and obtain a chase aircraft during RTB, if practical. If remaining
     stores present a recovery hazard, jettison in a suitable area on a single pass, if practical.
     3.5.1.11. Hung Ordnance. Note weapons switch settings and then safe the armament
     system. Crews experiencing a hung store may contact the RCO for permission to release
     or jettison the hung stores in a suitable area. If a hung store cannot be jettisoned or
     released, or if the crew elects not to jettison, the crew will accomplish any required
     checklists and recover to the most appropriate airfield while avoiding over-flight of
     populated areas. If practical, obtain a chase and have the aircraft visually inspected.
     Refer to local guidance for recovery procedures with hung weapons. Air refueling may
     be accomplished for safe recovery of the aircraft. Land from a straight in approach. If
     the crew is required to land at an airfield other than the base of operations with hung or
     unexpended weapons, advise the local authorities of the situation so that proper
     coordination can be accomplished with their safety office.
     3.5.1.11. (EDWARDSAFB) See AFFTCI 11-1/EAFBI 13-100 (when published) for
     local procedures for jettison and recovery of aircraft with a release malfunction.
     3.5.1.12. Hang Fire/Misfire - General.
     3.5.1.12. (EDWARDSAFB) See AFFTCI 11-1/EAFBI 13-100 (when published) for
     local procedures for jettison and recovery of aircraft with a release malfunction.
        3.5.1.12.1. A missile that fires but fails to depart the aircraft is a hangfire. If this
        occurs, the chase pilot (if available) should closely observe and safety check the
        missile. Follow the hung ordnance recovery procedures in accordance with local
        guidance.
        3.5.1.12.2. A missile that fails to fire when all appropriate switches were selected is a
        misfire. If this occurs, safe the Master Arm switch and follow the hung ordnance
        recovery procedures.
     3.5.1.13. On-Range NORDO Procedures.
        3.5.1.13.1. Attempt contact with the RCO on the appropriate back-up frequency. If
        unable to establish contact, make a pass by the range control tower (over the target if
        flying on an unmanned range) on the attack heading while rocking wings, and turn in
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                    39


         the direction of traffic. The flight leader will either rejoin the flight and RTB, or
         direct another flight member to escort the NORDO to a recovery base.
         3.5.1.13.2. If the NORDO aircraft has an emergency, and conditions permit, make a
         pass by the range control tower, on the attack heading while rocking wings, turn
         opposite the direction of traffic, and proceed to a suitable recovery base. The flight
         leader will direct a flight member to join-up and escort the emergency aircraft.
         3.5.1.13.3. Unexpended Ordnance. If radio failure occurs and circumstances
         preclude landing with unexpended ordnance, accomplish a safe jettison of the
         ordnance. The NORDO aircraft should join on another flight member that has radio
         contact with the RCO and the remainder of the flight if possible. Relay visual signals
         specified in AFI 11-205, Aircraft Cockpit and Formation Flight Signals to the
         NORDO aircraft to initiate stores jettison (hold fist at top of canopy and make several
         pumping motions).
  3.5.2. Air Drop Operations. Units conducting aerial delivery operations will develop
  specialized training programs and operational procedures. Units will employ AFI 11-301
  Volume 2, Aircrew Life Support Equipment, AFJI 13-210, Joint Airdrop Inspection Records,
  Malfunction Investigations, and Activity Reporting, AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist
  Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, FM 31-19 (US Army), and applicable T.O.s for
  all operations. Refer to MD specific attachment and or other MAJCOM instructions for
  guidance.
     3.5.2.1. Airdrops will be conducted in VMC. IMC airdrops are permitted if aircraft is
     equipped with approved software/hardware and aircrew properly trained in its operation.
     Comply with airspace and DZ restrictions for blind DZ operations. For detailed
     information on DZ sizes, markings, types, and weather and wind limits, refer to AFI 13-
     217. For information on aerial delivery airspeeds and altitudes, refer to AFI 11-231.
     3.5.2.2. Jumpmaster directed personnel airdrops require OG/CC approval (not required
     for rotary-wing aircraft). The OG/CC can approve these airdrops on a case by case basis,
     or may approve multiple airdrops from a test plan or support mission program.
     Document with a memorandum for record. If approved, the user accepts all
     responsibility for airdrop accuracy and damage to equipment or injury to personnel.
     3.5.2.3. Approved computer-aided computed air release point (CARP) and high-altitude
     release point (HARP) programs may be used but results must be verified. The following
     information must be checked/verified: DZ impact coordinates; load information to
     include number and type parachute, load weights, sequence of extraction, and load
     position.
     3.5.2.4. Crews will not make airdrop using parachutes for which AFI 11-231, Computed
     Air Release Point Procedures, does not list ballistics unless the user provides approved
     ballistic data. This does not apply to formal test missions where the purpose of the test is
     to derive ballistic data for a specific load.
     3.5.2.5. The primary aircrew will review the DZ survey during mission planning.
     3.5.2.6. ADD Form 1748, Joint Airdrop Inspection Report, will be accomplished prior
     to all equipment airdrops. Completion, retention, and disposition of the form will be in
40                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


     accordance with AFJI 13-210 and the AF Records Disposition Schedule. EXCEPTION:
     A-71 and A-21 containers rigger for door bundles.
     3.5.2.7. Radio transmissions with the DZ are limited to those required for safety of flight
     considerations. This includes ATC directions, range clearance, unsafe surface conditions,
     or mission changes. Radio silence/no communications procedures will be coordinated
     prior to mission execution.
     3.5.2.8. Drop clearance is normally inherent with mission clearance to unmanned DZs.
     The aircrew observing the proper briefed authentication confirms drop clearance in
     VMC. Drop clearance is confirmed via radio call or beacon acquisition in IMC.
     Absence of the prebriefed marking, jumbled block letter, the letter X, or red
     light/smoke/flare is considered a no-drop call.
     3.5.2.9. No-Drop Decisions.
         3.5.2.9.1. Prior to the 1-or 2-minute warning, notify the AC when any condition
         exists that could jeopardize a safe drop.
         3.5.2.9.2. After the 1- or 2-minute warning, any crewmember observing a condition
         that would jeopardize a safe drop will transmit ―NO DROP‖ on the interphone.
         3.5.2.9.3. A ―NO DROP‖ will be called if checklists items required prior to the 10/5
         second call have not been completed.
         3.5.2.9.4. The non-flying pilot, the navigator (if applicable) and the loadmaster will
         acknowledge the ―NO DROP‖ call. All applicable aircrew will immediately
         configure any automatic airdrop switches to prevent automatic release of the load.
         The AC will immediately instruct the crew to follow the appropriate procedures.
  3.5.3. Low Level Navigation Operations. AFMC invokes AFI 11-214 Low Altitude training
  rules for low altitude missions with the additional restrictions detailed below.
  Developmental testing in the low level structure will be conducted in accordance with test
  and safety review board guidance.
     3.5.3.1. Low level environment. Between sunrise and sunset, the low level environment
     defined by this instruction is at or below 2000 feet AGL. For IMC or night operations the
     low level environment is defined as below the MSA.
     3.5.3.2. Minimum Altitudes. (N/A C-130 and C-17. See the MDS attachment).
         3.5.3.2.1. Day VMC. Fixed wing pilots will not conduct low level flight below 500
         feet AGL unless current and qualified (or in an approved training program) in Low
         Altitude Step Down Training (LASDT). Helicopter and tilt rotor operations in the
         CONV/VTOL mode will not be conducted below 100 feet above the highest obstacle
         (AHO). This altitude restriction does not apply to flight test techniques, such as
         tower flybys, performed within Edwards AFB class D airspace, or FCF missions.
         3.5.3.2.1. (EDWARDSAFB) The FCF required checks of aircraft or aircraft
         systems below 500 feet AGL will be conducted by LASDT trained FCF aircrew. If
         LASDT trained FCF aircrew are not available, FCF checks below 500 feet AGL may
         be accomplished on the low altitude speed calibration course, the tower fly-by line or
         in an airport traffic pattern.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                       41


         3.5.3.2.2. Night and IMC. Aircraft will not fly lower than the MSA (or RAA when
         operating in Special Use Airspace (SUA) vice a MTR) unless using an approved
         Terrain Following (TF), Terrain Avoidance (TA), or other system. The pilots must be
         qualified in the system used, and the system must be fully operative.
         3.5.3.2.3. Night VMC. Pilots using NVGs can fly lower than the MSA (or RAA
         when operating in a SUA vice a MTR) in VMC conditions under high illumination
         conditions as defined in AFI 11-214 . The aircrew must be current and qualified in
         below MSA NVG operations, or in the upgrade program and under the supervision of
         an IP per the training program. Also, the aircraft must have an operable radar
         altimeter unless executing a test plan. During NVG low level operations, altitude
         warning will be set to the minimum altitude planned during the low level route.
         Rotary wing and tilt-rotor pilots must refer to their specific attachments for guidance.
     3.5.3.3. Visual Procedures. Weather minimums for visual low level operations will be
     1,500 feet (1000 for helicopters and tilt-rotor aircraft in CONV/VTOL mode) ceiling and
     3 miles visibility for any route or area, or as specified in FLIP for MTRs, unit regulations
     or national rules, whichever is higher.
         3.5.3.3.1. At altitudes below 1,000 feet AGL, wingmen will not fly at a lower AGL
         altitude than lead.
         3.5.3.3.2. When crossing ridges, high or hilly terrain, maintain positive G on the
         aircraft and do not exceed 120 (60 for helicopters) degrees of bank. Maneuvering at
         less than 1 G is limited to upright (less than 90 degrees of bank) bunting maneuvers.
         3.5.3.3.3. If unable to visually acquire or ensure lateral separation from known
         vertical obstructions which are a factor to the route of flight, flight leads will direct a
         climb no later than 3 NM (1 NM for helicopters and tilt-rotor aircraft in
         CONV/VTOL mode) prior to the obstacle to an altitude that ensures vertical
         separation.
         3.5.3.3.4. Military Training Route (MTR) Transition. Radar services and on-board
         radar systems will be used to the maximum extent practical to assist with visual look-
         out. Unless a faster minimum safe maneuvering speed is required by the aircraft T.O.,
         delay acceleration to airspeeds authorized in FLIP until established inside the
         confines of the MTR and decelerate back to low altitude cruise speed prior to route
         exit. If an unplanned route exit occurs (e.g. route abort, Terrain Flowing Radar (TFR)
         fly-up, etc.), slow to low altitude cruise speed after terrain or obstacle clearance is
         assured. Avoid Class A/B/C/D airspace. Limit time in Federal Airways to that
         required to cross them.
  3.5.4. Low Altitude Step Down Training (LASDT) Operations (N/A C-130 and C-17. See
  MD attachments). LASDT applies to fixed wing operations below 500 feet AGL, except for
  takeoff and landing, and weapons delivery minimum recovery altitudes. LASDT applies to
  rotary-wing enroute cruise operations below 300 feet AGL, except for takeoff and landing
  and remote operations. LASDT fixed wing aircrew will not fly lower than 200 feet AGL
  during training and will not fly lower than 100 feet AGL during test unless approved by the
  safety and test review boards. LASDT rotary wing aircrew will not fly lower than 50 feet

   AHO during training or during test unless approved by the safety and test review boards.
   MD specific guidance is provided in this instruction‘s attachments if necessary.
   3.5.5. Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance (TF/TA). TF/TA operations are prohibited
   unless the crew is current and qualified in TF/TA operations as defined in AFI 11-2FT
   Volume 1. Alternatively, qualified FCF/ACF/OCF aircrew may conduct day VMC TF/TA
   operations in accordance with T.O. -6 procedures. Flights will only be conducted in
   approved airspace. TF operations specified in an approved test plan will operate within the
   guidelines of the test plan and any restrictions imposed by the safety review board. Annotate
   low-level charts with TF Start/Termination areas. Minimum altitude for TF/TA operations
   will be no lower than aircrew qualification for Low Level Navigation or LASDT.
      3.5.5.1. Negative Altitude Variations on IR routes. Excessive negative altitude
      variations will not ensure safe terrain clearance at your MSA. Aircrews will use altitude
      variations from Pilot to Metro Service (PMSV) (or compute using PMSV altimeter
      settings and D values) to determine which route segments are affected by excessive
      altitude variations. This information should be obtained as close as possible to the
      planned entry time. Crews unable to contact a PMSV station may enter using information
      from the preflight weather briefing.
          3.5.5.1.1. NVGs may be used to clear terrain visually during night VMC. TF
          equipped aircraft may continue to TF in an area of excessive negative altitude
          variation. However, in the event of a fly-up, TF malfunction, or any required climb to
          MSA, you must abort the route. If any of the following situations occur during IMC
          or at night and the crew is unable to clear terrain visually, abort the route:
              3.5.5.1.1.1. The difference between aircraft system altitude and the Mean Sea
              level (MSL) altitude as indicated with the most current altimeter setting exceeds -
              400 feet. This can be measured directly by taking an altitude calibration (for
              example, a 2420 MSL pressure altimeter reading and a 2000ft system (true)
              altitude would yield a -420 ft altitude variation).
              3.5.5.1.1.2. The aircraft radar altimeter indicates less than a 600 ft terrain
              clearance while at the MSA.
              3.5.5.1.1.3. Flying and maintaining TF clearance plane settings and the aircraft
              pressure altimeters indicate at or above the route MSA.
          3.5.5.2. Crews may enter the route in IMC conditions and fly MSA up to the area of
          excessive altitude variation. Prior to entering the area of excessive altitude variation,
          crews must be able to visually clear terrain or fly TF, in order to continue low level
          operations. Once the forecast/observed area(s) of excessive altitude variation is over-
          flown, subsequent portions of the low level route may be flown.
3.6. Flight Test Mission Operations.
   3.6.1. Flight Test Orientation. For specific guidance see the MD attachment.
   3.6.2. Target. Target operations refer to direct support missions that do not involve chase
   events. A chase qualification is not required to fly target events. In the absence of test or
   safety review board restrictions follow the guidance in this instruction‘s paragraph 3.4 Air-
   to-Air Operations.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                      43


  3.6.3. Chase. This section describes general procedures for planning, briefing and flying
  chase formations. This guidance is not intended for test support aircraft being employed in a
  ―target‖ role.
     3.6.3.1. General. In addition to specific flight test requirements, the test aircrew are
     often concentrating on items not generally associated with normal formation operations.
     The chase aircrew must be aware of the test point requirements, monitor parameters,
     ensure safe separation and clear for the formation. To optimize the contribution chase
     assets provide, test aircrew will brief specific chase procedures for each test point to
     include description of the test maneuver, expected chase position, expected parameters,
     expected radio calls, and rejoin procedures.
     3.6.3.1. (EDWARDSAFB) Chase aircrew fulfill a valuable role that should be fully
     utilized by the test team. Specific chase objectives, duties, and responsibilities will be in
     accordance with the governing test safety package. However, an overarching requirement
     is that chase aircrew must never be a hazard to the test aircraft or article. Units will
     schedule chase aircraft configurations to ensure test and safety plan requirements are met.
     3.6.3.2. Types of Chase. The test team will clearly brief the chase crew‘s objectives in
     accordance with test and safety review board stipulations. Flight leads will cover chase
     aircrew positions and responsibilities during the flight briefing. The flight lead will direct
     chase positions in flight as required by test objectives.
         3.6.3.2.1. Safety Chase. Visual formation that maximizes the briefed chase duties.
         Chase duties include but are not limited to, deconfliction, clearing, observing test
         point execution, monitoring altitudes, airspeeds, limits and other flight parameters
         and periodic checks of aircraft and store condition.
         3.6.3.2.1. (EDWARDSAFB) The default fighter safety chase position is similar to a
         fighting wing.
         3.6.3.2.2. Area Chase. The chase aircraft need only remain in the designated test
         area and maintain radio contact with the test aircraft. The chase pilot should maintain
         situation awareness of the test aircraft‘s location via use of data link information,
         radar, air-to-air TACAN, and/or ground controllers, as required and should de-
         conflict his flight path from all other airborne elements of the mission. Area chase
         should remain in a position where an expeditious intercept to rejoin with the test
         aircraft can be accomplished, if required.
         3.6.3.2.3. Photo Chase. Position is dictated by the photo requirements of the test and
         photographic equipment. Flight planning and briefing shall include formation
         positions during various phases of flight or test points as well as radio terminology.
         Pilot and photographer will discuss camera communications, maneuvers to be
         performed, disposition and stowage of photographic equipment in the event of
         emergency egress and ejection. Regardless, maintaining the briefed minimum safe
         distance from the test aircraft, test items, or the terrain remains a primary
         responsibility of the chase pilot.
         3.6.3.2.4. Instructor Pilot/Standardization Evaluation Flight Examiner (IP/SEFE)
         Chase. IP/SEFE chase is close formation to route formation so as to evaluate
         maneuvering parameters. In-flight nose-tail separation will be maintained.
44                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


     3.6.3.3. Requirements and Restrictions. Any pilot may chase an aircraft under
     emergency or impending emergency conditions. Pilots who have completed an
     Instrument/Qualification evaluation may chase as safety observer for aircraft performing
     simulated instrument flight or hung ordnance patterns. Pilots that have completed the
     chase upgrade training may chase test events. Only, an instructor or evaluator may fly
     IP/SEFE chase.
        3.6.3.3.1. Missions Requiring Chase Support. The following types of test missions
        will include a chase aircraft, unless a test safety review board specifically assesses
        otherwise: first flights on new aircraft; performance testing of new/modified test
        aircraft, stability & control and/or flying qualities evaluations of modified or new
        aircraft configurations; structural integrity tests; dispensing, separation, functional
        and/or jettison tests of modified or new munitions (live or inert) and suspension
        equipment; captive compatibility flights (except baseline flights); and missions which
        prevent the test aircrew from clearing their flight path in ―see and avoid‖ airspace.
        Chase pilots must continue to fulfill briefed responsibilities until the test aircraft
        either lands or reverts to a non-chase required configuration or mission (for example,
        following release of a test weapon).
        3.6.3.3.2. Briefing. To the maximum extent possible, briefings between chase and
        test aircrew will be conducted face-to-face. Mission briefings at a minimum will
        include telephonic coordination with test aircrew. Chase briefings will specifically
        cover relevant test hazards and risk minimizing procedures, separation of aircraft,
        minimum and abort altitudes, chase positions, minimum safe distances from test
        aircraft and test items, control-room and flight communication, mission, photo, and
        safety-related radio calls and terminology.
        3.6.3.3.2. (EDWARDSAFB) Chase aircrew will brief any performance limitations
        that may impact chase requirements and how they will comply with flight test aircrew
        direction. Telephonic briefings will be approved and coordinated by the test director.
        3.6.3.3.3. Test/Chase Aircraft Configuration. Chase aircrew should assist with
        preflight of the test aircraft and munitions to observe and become familiar with
        configurations, lanyards, panels, airframe scratches, etc.. This is not required where
        there is no external test item and there is no additional risk of structural failures due to
        the flight test such as avionics or software tests.
        3.6.3.3.4. Communications. Primary test and chase aircraft will maintain radio
        contact during the mission. To maximum extent possible, the chase aircraft will
        monitor Guard radio frequency. The chase pilot will issue immediate advisories to
        lead if lead deviates significantly from intended maneuvers or pre-briefed flight
        profile. Chase will relay all ―terminate,‖ ―abort,‖ or ―knock-it-off‖ calls.
        3.6.3.3.5. Fuel. Fuel planning should account for test mission accomplishment and
        contingencies. When safety chase is required for recovery, fuel planning must permit
        chase aircrew to chase the test aircraft to a full stop landing, followed by another
        approach to a full stop by the chase aircraft.
        3.6.3.3.6. Weather. Weather for safety chase formation is a discernable horizon, 3
        NM of visibility, and clear of clouds.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                    45


        3.6.3.3.7. Minimum altitudes/airspeeds. Excluding airborne pickups, pattern and
        landing chase, or unless specifically permitted by the technical/safety review boards,
        the chase minimum altitude is 500 ft. AGL. The chase will not stack lower than lead
        when operating below 1,000 feet AGL. Exaggerated rolling or vertical maneuvers
        below 5,000 ft. AGL are prohibited.
            3.6.3.3.7.1. Airborne Pickup. When performing an airborne pickup chase will fly
            no slower than final turn / final approach speed and no lower than 200 feet AGL.
            This procedure may be modified by specific test mission requirements if approved
            by test and safety review boards.
            3.6.3.3.7.2. In the traffic pattern, IP/SEFE chase aircraft may maneuver as
            necessary to observed performance, but go no lower than 50 feet AGL. All other
            chase aircrew must initiate go around by 200 feet AGL, unless an emergency
            requires a lower altitude or specifically approved by a test safety review board to
            support test requirements. However, 50 feet AGL is an absolute minimum.
            3.6.3.3.7.3. Planned recovery and abort altitudes and g-loadings following dives
            will be based on available aircraft performance, and should account for the chase
            aircraft worst cast condition. Normally, aircrew should plan on a wings-level 4g
            pull-out. Higher load factors may be flown, if within aircraft limits, to provide
            increased margins of safety.
            3.6.3.3.7.4. The chase pilot must be able to fulfill chase responsibilities while
            remaining at or above approach speed for the power approach configuration as a
            minimum. If the chase event requires a slower airspeed, a different type of chase
            aircraft should be selected for the planned test maneuvers or a solution based on
            geometry while maintaining chase approach speed or higher.
     3.6.3.4. Separation from Test Aircraft/ Air Vehicles/Munitions:
        3.6.3.4.1. Manned Aircraft: Fly no closer than route formation during test
        maneuvering unless performing briefed photo chase duties or ―battle-damage‖/―clean
        and dry‖ checks.
        3.6.3.4.2. RPA/SUAS: Fly no closer than the test and safety board approved
        minimum distance.
        3.6.3.4.3. Munitions: The chase aircrew will maneuver and position themselves so
        that if the munition or store being tested separates unexpectedly no undue hazard is
        created. When chasing an item with an armed flight termination system, adjust
        maneuvers and position to avoid the associated blast and fragmentation zone to the
        maximum extent possible. When chasing live ordnance missions, the chase pilot
        must ensure safe separation in case of early fuse function, as well as safe escape.
     3.6.3.5. Terminate test and chase events for any of the following: exceeding limits, loss
     of situation awareness, other air vehicles become a safety risk to the flight, a dangerous
     situation is developing, radio failure is recognized, airspace boundaries are violated, or
     visual contact with the test aircraft is lost (area chase excepted). Termination of a test
     event does not relieve the chase aircraft of the responsibility to de-conflict from the test
     aircraft and to provide see and avoid clearing. If chase is unable to perform these duties
46                                 AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


     due to loss of situational awareness or malfunction, chase must immediately notify the
     flight lead, test director, and other participating aircraft.
     3.6.3.6. Cargo and Bomber Model Aircraft Restrictions.
         3.6.3.6.1. Cargo and bomber model aircraft may chase like aircraft (same MD) if the
         aircrew are visual formation trained. In this case, a chase qualification is not
         required. At no time will the chase aircraft come within 200 feet of the test aircraft.
         3.6.3.6.2. Cargo and bomber series aircraft may chase dissimilar aircraft (different
         MD) if the aircrew are chase qualified. At no time will the chase aircraft come within
         200 feet of the test aircraft. Exception: See MD attachment for C-12 chase minimum
         spacing.
  3.6.4. Ordnance Release Test. All weapons delivery guidance applies.               For specific
  guidance see the MD attachment.
  3.6.5. Hi Angle of Attack (Hi AoA). For specific guidance see the MD attachment.
  3.6.6. Compatibility Flight Profile (CFP). Fly training CFP events to no greater than 90
  percent of actual aircraft or store limits. For specific guidance see the MD attachment.
  3.6.7. Loads. Fly training loads profiles to no greater than 90 percent of actual aircraft or
  stores limits. For specific guidance see the MD attachment.
  3.6.8. Flutter. Fly training flutter profiles to no greater than 90 percent of actual aircraft or
  stores limits. For specific guidance see the MD attachment.
  3.6.9. Airstart (Single-Engine Aircraft). For specific guidance see the MD attachment.
  3.6.10. Test Pilot School (TPS) Curriculum. This section applies to qualifications for non-
  TPS assigned aircrew to instruct various TPS curriculum events in non-TPS assigned aircraft.
  Examples include, but are not limited to, F-15 Asymmetry, C-130 performance evaluations,
  and systems evaluations. Guidance is provided either in this instruction‘s MD attachments,
  or in the unit‘s supplement to this instruction.
  3.6.11. Air-to-Air Refueling Tanker Test. For specific guidance see the MD attachment.
  3.6.12. Airdrop Test. For specific guidance see the MD attachment.
  3.6.13. Qualitative Evaluations.
     3.6.13.1. Pilots. TPS graduates or TPS students performing qualitative flying evaluations
     in conjunction with a TPS syllabus or short term qualitative evaluations may, under the
     direct supervision of an instructor, operate the aircraft during critical phases of flight per
     AFI 11-202v3 AFMC Sup 1.
     3.6.13.2. Navigators/WSO/CSO, non-rated aircrew and CEAs. TPS graduates or TPS
     students performing qualitative flying evaluations in conjunction with a TPS syllabus
     event or short term qualitative evaluations; may, under the direct supervision of an
     instructor operate the aircraft during all non-critical phases of flight and the following
     critical phases of flight: Low Level above 1000 feet AGL (300 ft AGL for helicopters),
     non diving level Weapons Delivery above 1000 feet AGL, and Instrument/VFR
     approaches and patterns above 500 feet AGL.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                      47


     3.6.13.3. Non-TPS graduate TPS staff instructors performing curriculum mission
     familiarization flights; may, under the direct supervision of an instructor pilot, operate the
     aircraft during all non-critical phases of flight and the following critical phases of flight:

          should not be flown.
   4.2.3. Approach Category C Aircraft.
      4.2.3.1. Approach speeds of 121 knots to 140 knots.
      4.2.3.2. If approach speed exceeds 140 knots, no matter the configuration or type of
      approach (i.e. straight-in, side-step, circling), the minimums for the appropriate category
      will be used.
   4.2.4. Approach Category B Aircraft.
      4.2.4.1. Approach speeds of 91 knots to 120 knots.
      4.2.4.2. If approach speed exceeds 120 knots, not matter the configuration or type of
      approach (i.e. straight-in, side-step, circling), the minimums for the appropriate category
      will be used.
   4.2.5. Approach Category A Aircraft.
      4.2.5.1. Approach speeds of 90 knots or less.
      4.2.5.2. If approach speed exceeds 90 knots, no matter the configuration or type of
      approach (i.e. straight-in, side-step, circling), the minimums for the appropriate category
      will be used.
4.3. Weather Avoidance.
   4.3.1. Plan and fly all missions to avoid areas of known or forecast severe weather including
   severe icing or severe turbulence. These restrictions do not apply to planned severe weather
   penetration as part of an approved test plan.
   4.3.2. During flight, attempt to avoid thunderstorms by at least the following unless further
   restricted in MD attachment:
      4.3.2.1. 20 NMs laterally at or above flight level (FL) 230.
      4.3.2.2. 10 NMs laterally below FL 230.
      4.3.2.3. 5 NMs for operations below 5000 feet.
      4.3.2.4. Avoid gust fronts and winds preceding a rapidly moving thunderstorm. Avoid
      areas of high lightning potential; i.e. clouds within plus or minus 5000 feet of the freezing
      level.
   4.3.3. Do not fly directly above (within 2,000 feet) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds.
   If unable to vertically clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds by at least 2000 feet
   vertically, you must avoid them using the above criteria.
   4.3.4. Do not fly into an area of known or forecast moderate or greater mountain wave
   turbulence. The OG/CC may allow the following aircraft to fly in areas of forecast or known
   moderate mountain wave turbulence: T-6, A-10, F-15, F-16, F-22, F-35, T-37, A/T-38
   aircraft.
   4.3.4. (EDWARDSAFB) The following aircraft may fly in areas of forecast or known
   moderate mountain wave turbulence: T-6, F-15, F-16, F-22, F-35, A/T-38 aircraft.
 50                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


   4.3.5. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) 412 TW aircraft will not take off when 412 OSS Weather
   reports lightning is observed within 5 miles of Edwards AFB. Aircrew will not attempt to
   depart an airfield unless a route of flight avoiding thunderstorms and lightning can be
   determined prior to takeoff. The flight route must allow for unimpeded return to the
   departure airfield or to a suitable emergency recovery airfield.
4.4. Advisory Calls (N/A C-130). The following procedures are applicable to multi-place
aircraft that do not have guidance defined in Technical Orders. See MD attachment for C-130
Operations. Fighter-Trainers are considered single-place aircraft and exempt from these
requirements.
   4.4.1. Advisory Calls. The pilot flying will periodically announce intentions during
   departures, arrivals, approaches, and when circumstances require deviating from normal
   procedures. Mandatory advisory calls are: (The pilot not flying the aircraft will make these
   calls except those designated for any crewmember).
   4.4.2. Altitude Calls, unless announced by an aircraft system.
      4.4.2.1. 1,000 feet above IAF (or holding) altitude.
      4.4.2.2. Transition altitude/level.
      4.4.2.3. 1,000 feet above or below assigned altitude.
      4.4.2.4. During instrument approaches call 100 feet above procedure turn, FAF, MDA,
      or Decision Height (DH) altitude.
      4.4.2.5. Non Precision Approaches. The pilot not flying will state ―MDA‖ when
      reaching MDA and ―Runway in Sight‖ when the runway environment is in sight. The
      pilot flying will state intentions (i.e. ―Continue‖ or ―Land‖) and continue the approach
      below the MDA only if the aircraft is in a position to make a normal approach to the
      runway of intended landing and the pilot flying clearly sees the approach threshold of the
      runway, approach lights, or other markings identifiable with the approach end of the
      runway. Otherwise, either pilot will state ―Go Around‖ at the MAP and the pilot flying
      will execute the appropriate missed approach procedure, ATC issued climbout
      instructions, or ATC clearance.
      4.4.2.6. Precision Approaches. The pilot not flying will state ―DH‖ when reaching DH.
      At DH the pilot flying will state intentions (i.e. ―Continue‖, ―Land‖ or ―Go Around‖).
      The pilot flying may continue the approach below DH only if the aircraft is in a position
      to make a normal approach to the runway of intended landing and the pilot flying clearly
      sees the approach threshold of the runway , approach lights, or other markings
      identifiable with the approach end of the runway. Otherwise, the pilot flying will execute
      the appropriate missed approach procedure, ATC issued climbout instructions, or ATC
      clearance.
   4.4.3. Deviations. The pilot not flying the aircraft will tell the other pilot when heading or
   airspeed deviations are observed or altitude is more than 100 feet from desired and no
   attempt is being made to correct the deviation.
      4.4.3.1. Any crewmember seeing a variation of 200 feet altitude, a deviation of +/- 10
      knots in airspeed or a potential terrain or obstruction problem will immediately tell the
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                   51


       pilot. Deviations from prescribed procedures for the approach being flown will also be
       announced.
4.5. Instrument Approach Briefings/Checklists. Multi-place aircraft that do not have
guidance defined in Technical Orders will ensure the following items are set or checked and
briefed prior to the IAF: heading and attitude systems, navigation and communication radios,
TACAN/VOR select switch, the final approach course and altimeters. In addition, review the
approach and the aerodrome sketch and brief the following items: sector altitude, DH or MDA,
field elevation, weather required for approach, missed approach point, climbout, and intentions,
terrain/obstacle hazards, crew duties and responsibilities, lost communication intentions, and
backup approach and frequencies.
4.6. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) VFR Procedures. 412 TW pilots are authorized to operate
VFR instead of IFR when not flying within Class A airspace or high-density traffic areas (areas
adjacent to or above Class B airspace) and any of the following conditions are met:
   4.6.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Flights are flown under VMC conditions in the local
   flying area (R2515 and R2508 Complex MOAs).
   4.6.2. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Test and test support missions are flown to test sites and
   test supporting facilities within the local flying area, and to sites immediately outside the
   local flying area.
   4.6.3. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Flights are flown from Edwards AFB to and from
   specially approved low-altitude, high-speed routes required for test missions (terrain
   following, terrain avoidance, etc.).
   4.6.4. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Departures and recoveries are flown to and from R2508
   for aircraft stationed at AF Plant 42.
   4.6.5. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) In order to preclude saturating Edwards AFB traffic
   pattern, transition/instrument training flights should be accomplished at AF Plant
   42/Palmdale, So Cal Logistics (Victorville), WJ Fox Field, Lancaster or China Lake.
   Instrument approaches may be flown under a VFR clearance at these fields.
4.7. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Weather Radar. 412 TW inflight weather radar requirements
for weather radar equipped aircraft (unless waived by the unit commander) are:
   4.7.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Weather             radar   must   be    operative   for   overseas
   deployments.
   4.7.2. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Weather radar must be operative for flight                       in
   thunderstorm weather warning areas with thunderstorm coverage of ―few‖ or greater.
   4.7.3. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Weather radar must be operative for night IMC flight in
   uncontrolled airspace.

                                            Chapter 5

                    OPERATING PROCEDURES AND RESTRICTIONS

5.1. General. These procedures do not supersede flight manual guidance. Refer to MD
attachments for additional aircraft specific operational limits and restrictions.
5.2. Technical Orders. All aircraft will be operated IAW the applicable technical orders. In
the case where technical orders do not yet exist personnel will not operate new equipment or
modified aircraft without properly validated and verified tech data in accordance with 00-5 series
T.O.s. Once validated by flight test, new equipment can be operated using test cards derived
from an approved test plan if other tech data does not yet exist. Modified aircraft will be
operated in accordance with the aircraft modification flight manual.
5.3. Developmental Software. The aircraft chief of engineering or aircraft System Program
Director (SPD) must certify developmental software, including mission planning software for
flight outside a test program. Under no circumstances will a flight outside of a test program take
place with software that has not passed a safety of flight evaluation.
5.4. New/Modified Aircraft Equipment/Weapons. Aircrew members not qualified in the
operation of new or modified aircraft equipment are restricted in aircrew duties. They will not
operate that equipment on any flight unless under the supervision of a current and qualified
instructor of like specialty qualified in that equipment. This restriction does not apply to aircraft
and aircrew under a formal test plan.
5.5. Wind and Sea State Restrictions (Ejection Seat Aircraft). Normal flying operations will
not be conducted when surface winds along the intended route of flight exceed 35 knots steady
state or when the sea state exceeds 10 feet wave height. This is not intended to restrict
operations when only a small portion of the route is affected. If possible, alter mission plan to
avoid the area. The unit OG/CC is the waiver authority for this paragraph.
5.6. Aerial Demonstration/Show Formation. Refer to AFI 11-209, Aerial Event Policy and
Procedures, AFI 11-246, Air Force Aircraft Demonstrations, and applicable MAJCOM
directives for specific rules and appropriate approval levels to participate in static displays and
aerial events.
5.7. Aerial Photography and Equipment.
   5.7.1. Personnel authorized to use photographic equipment. Per AFI 33-117, Multimedia
   (MM) Management, only qualified aerial photographers (Air Force Specialty Code 3VOXX)
   are authorized to carry and operate photographic equipment in flight for mission related
   requirements.     Non-aerial photographer qualified personnel will not carry or use
   photographic equipment under the following conditions (OG/CCs may waive this
   requirement on a case by case basis for small single unit cameras that can be readily stowed
   for ejection or egress purposes): when flying in ejection seat aircraft; when occupying a
   crew station with a set of flight controls.
   5.7.2. Approved equipment. Equipment used during flight must meet the requirements of
   AFI 11-202V3.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                      53


   5.7.3. Fighter/Trainer Aircraft. Due to limited space and safety considerations, do not take
   more than two camera systems on board the aircraft. A mission requiring more than two
   cameras requires OG/CC approval. Equipment size must be small enough to take out and/or
   stow quickly without interfering with flight controls or throttles. Keep equipment stored
   until needed. Remove straps and lens caps before departing for the aircraft. Cords must be
   coiled, not rigid. Inventory equipment before and after each mission. Notify crew chief of
   FOD, if applicable. Do not lay professional gear on bare consoles, instead, place gear inside
   helmet bag. Equipment must remain clear of the control stick/yoke, throttles and any other
   cockpit controls or displays that are critical to flight safety. If time permits, store all gear
   prior to ejection.
5.8. Flight Duty Period (FDP). Observe guidance contained in AFI 11-202 Vol 3 Chapter 9,
AFI 11-202 Vol 3 AFMC Sup 1, and specific MD attachments to this instruction.
   5.8.1. USAF TPS students will not be scheduled for events which would deny them 12 hours
   of crew rest. However, students may elect to use school facilities (i.e. computers, data
   reduction equipment and audio-visual equipment) so long as it does not interfere with the
   opportunity for at least 8 hours of uninterrupted rest. To ensure this happens, students will
   depart the USAF TPS no later than 1 hour before the 8 hour window for uninterrupted rest
   begins. The additional hour is allotted for activity such as transportation, meals and hygiene
   related events.
   5.8.2. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Aircrew engaged in flight test or test support in single
   pilot aircraft (except for the U-2) will observe the following sortie duration limits: a
   maximum of 3.0 hours of test time (beginning at start of first test point and running
   continuously until 3.0 hours have expired), and a maximum scheduled sortie duration of 4.5
   hours (including transit time). The primary test unit is responsible for coordinating with the
   supporting unit commanders when other test/test support assets are used. Unit commanders
   must consider aircrew experience, time of day, complexity, and the impact of delays in their
   decision. Permission to SCHEDULE a test or test support sortie in excess of these
   restrictions requires advance approval from the 412 OG/CC. This should normally be
   accomplished at the week prior TW scheduling meeting. Other exceptions must be
   coordinated and approved by the 412 OG/CC. To the max extent possible, extensions should
   be coordinated prior to the brief time for the affected sortie. However, real-time (airborne)
   extensions will be considered if fully justified.
5.9. Checklists. A checklist is not complete until all items have been accomplished. Notes
amplifying checklist procedures or limitations may be added to the checklists. Checklist items
that do not apply to the unit‘s aircraft or mission may be lined out.
5.10. Preflight/Ground Operations. When an aircraft gas turbine compressor or auxiliary
power unit is being operated during preflight or other ground operation, a person qualified in its
operation must be in a position to monitor audible and/or visual warning systems.
5.11. Seat and Safety Belt Requirements. PICs must ensure each occupant over two years old
has an approved seat equipped with a safety belt. Seat belts must be worn:
   5.11.1. When an ejection seat is occupied.
   5.11.2. In the pilot and copilot positions.
 54                                  AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


   5.11.3. As directed by the PIC.
   5.11.4. During taxi, takeoff, landing, and air refueling except for crewmembers (including
   test personnel conducting official test points) performing official flight duties or cockpit
   observation when wearing the seat belt is impractical.
   5.11.5. By each passenger and crewmember to avoid injury in the event of turbulence, unless
   crew duties dictate or the PIC has authorized otherwise. The PIC will direct all occupants to
   fasten seatbelts securely when turbulence is encountered or expected.
   5.11.6. If a shoulder harness is installed, it must be worn with the seat belt during each taxi,
   and takeoff, landing and critical phases of flight. Instructors and Flight Engineers (FEs) need
   not wear the shoulder harness if it interferes with performing duties. OG/CCs may waive this
   requirement for other selected crew positions if the shoulder harness interferes with crew
   duties.
5.12. High Speed Taxi Checks. A high speed taxi check is a maintenance operational check
which requires the aircraft to be moving at higher than normal taxi speed. Brake energy limits
and cooling must be considered when planning high speed taxi checks. High speed taxi checks,
to include barrier certifications, will be accomplished according to an approved test plan or
established FCF profile. In the absence of a test plan or FCF profile, these checks will be
approved by the OG/CC and accomplished by a qualified IP or FCF pilot. In multi-place aircraft,
both pilots must be qualified in the aircraft. High-speed taxi checks will be documented on a
flight authorization form.
5.13. Aircraft Malfunctions and Damage. Do not taxi aircraft with malfunctions that affect
the nosewheel steering or brake systems. Do not use a malfunctioning system unless it is
required for safe recovery of the aircraft. Do not continue in-flight trouble shooting of a
malfunction after completing flight manual emergency procedures. If structural damage occurs
or is suspected, the mission will be aborted and a landing will be made as soon as practical,
regardless of apparent damage.
5.14. Duty Station (multi-place aircraft). A qualified pilot will be at a set of controls of the
aircraft at all times during flight. All primary aircrew members will be at their duty stations
during critical phases of flight. During other phases of flight, crewmembers may leave their duty
station for brief periods to meet physiological needs and to perform normal crew duties. Only
one pilot may be absent from their duty station at a time. Notify the aircraft commander before
departing assigned primary duty station. The aircraft commander is the final authority for
allowing personnel to move about the aircraft during flight. Reference Table 4.1 AFI 11-202V3
AFMCSUP for further restrictions and exceptions.
   5.14.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Navigators/WSO/CSO,                     non-rated          aircrew,
   Indoctrination flyers, and Incentive/Fam/Orientation flyers are prohibited from conducting
   the following events in 412 TW aircraft: Formation closer than route, air refueling, low level
   flight below 1,000 feet AGL and Instrument/VFR approaches and patterns below 500 feet
   AGL.
5.15. Transfer of Aircraft Control. Both pilots of crew aircraft or pilots in two-seat aircraft
must know at all times who has control of the aircraft. Transfer of aircraft control will be made
with the statement ―You have the aircraft (controls).‖ The pilot receiving control of the aircraft
will acknowledge ―I have the aircraft (controls).‖ Once assuming control of the aircraft, maintain
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                           55


control until relinquishing it as stated above. For fighter and trainer aircraft, if the intercom fails,
the pilot in the front cockpit (if not in control of the aircraft) will rock the wings and assume
control of the aircraft, radios and navigational equipment unless pre-briefed otherwise. In
fighter, trainer, attack aircraft either person flying can pump the stick (―pump to pass‖) to pass
control to the other, who should then rock the wings (―shake to take‖) to acknowledge transfer of
aircraft control.
5.16. Takeoff Aborts. Prior to flight, all aircrew (pilots, flight engineers, etc) on the flight deck
or in the cockpit will review and understand takeoff data. Place particular emphasis on takeoff
and abort factors during abnormal situations such as short/wet runway, heavy gross weights, and
abort sequence in formation flights. Anytime an aircraft experiences a high speed abort, hot
brakes should be suspected. If confirmed, declare a ground emergency and taxi the aircraft to the
designated hot brake area and perform hot brake procedures. If an abort occurs during a takeoff
roll, the pilot will focus on maintaining directional control and slowing or stopping the aircraft as
appropriate. Following members of a formation will ensure clearance from an aborting aircraft
or will abort their takeoff if unable to maintain adequate clearance
5.17. G-Awareness. Perform a G-awareness exercise whenever 5 Gs or greater are expected
during the sortie. If available, select Positive Pressure Breathing (PPB) on all sorties regardless
of anticipated g-loading. The wearing of the Combat Edge vest in the F-15 and F-16 is optional.
If the vest is not worn, the CRU-94/120 port plug should be installed to ensure full pressure is
available to the mask. F-22 pilots will wear the Combat Edge vest on all sorties where g-loading
above 6 gs is anticipated, or if flight above 44,000 ft MSL is anticipated.
    5.17.1. Maintain a minimum of 6,000 ft spacing between aircraft during the G-awareness
    exercise. The G-awareness exercise will consist of two turns with at least 90 degrees of
    heading change. The second turn of the G-awareness exercise for air-to-air sorties will be a
    minimum of 180 degrees of turn. The first turn will be a smooth onset rate to approximately
    4 Gs. Pilots will use this turn to ensure proper G-suit operation and to practice their anti-G
    straining maneuver. Regain airspeed and perform another 90-180 degree turn at up to 6-7
    Gs. If aircraft limits preclude either of the above, turns should be performed so as not to
    exceed aircraft limits.
    5.17.2. Flight/element leads will ensure airspace intended for conducting the G-awareness
    exercise is free from potential traffic conflicts. Use air traffic control services to the
    maximum extent practical to ensure the airspace is clear. Conduct the G-awareness exercise
    in the following airspace with preference to the order as listed:
        5.17.2.1. Special Use Airspace (e.g. restricted/warning areas, ATCAAs, MOAs, and
        MAJCOM approved special mission areas).
        5.17.2.2. Above 10,000 ft MSL outside of Special Use Airspace.
        5.17.2.3. Inside the confines of Military Training Routes.
        5.17.2.4. Below 10,000 ft MSL outside of Special Use Airspace.
5.18. Unusual Attitude and Training Maneuvers (non-aerobatic). Do not perform unusual
attitude recoveries in single seat aircraft, at night or in IMC, and anytime the safety observer is
not qualified in the aircraft. Abrupt training maneuvers (intentional maneuvers involving an
abrupt change in aircraft attitude, an abnormal attitude, or abnormal accelerations or
 56                                  AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


decelerations not necessary for normal flight) are prohibited at night or in IMC and any time the
safety observer is not qualified in the aircraft. Initiate such maneuvers at an altitude that will
allow recovery no lower than 5,000 (500 for helicopters) feet AGL. These type maneuvers must
be performed in Special Use Airspace, ATC-Assigned Airspace (ATCAA), MTRs or host nation
approved airspace. For units without SUA, ATCAA, etc, OGs will pre-coordinate and establish
repeatable consistent routing and maneuver locations with Air Traffic Control for unit mission
accomplishment. Aircraft deployed or based at overseas locations will operate IAW applicable
host nation agreements or ICAO SARPs. If the aircraft operating requirements (altitude
requirements, maximum airspeeds, dropping of objects, etc) dictated in the host nation
agreement are less restrictive than USAF/MAJCOM guidance, the most restrictive guidance shall
be used.
5.19. Simulated Emergencies. Do not practice emergency procedures that degrade aircraft
performance or flight control capabilities unless specifically authorized by an approved training
syllabus, test plan or in accordance with applicable AFIs. In addition to the restrictions in AFI
11-202 Vol 3, the following restrictions apply:
   5.19.1. Fighter, Attack, Trainer, and U-2.
       5.19.1.1. During initial qualification or re-qualification sorties in single seat aircraft, the
       IP or EP will be in a chase aircraft (U-2 see MD attachment) and in a position to direct a
       go-around, if needed.
       5.19.1.2. Day VMC only.
       5.19.1.3. Gross weight must not exceed basic weight plus weight of full internal fuel or
       flight manual limits, whichever is less.
       5.19.1.4. No external ordnance, except training ordnance, may be carried.
       5.19.1.5. Simulated Single Engine (SSE). All engines will be used for unplanned go-
       arounds. Initiate SSE go-around above 200' AGL. SSE climb out is not authorized.
       5.19.1.6. No Flap full stop landings are prohibited unless required in an approved
       training syllabus or considered a normal procedure in the flight manual.
       5.19.1.7. Simulated Flameout (SFO) patterns. Specific procedures for conduct of SFO
       training will be established in letters of agreement with appropriate agencies and
       published in appropriate local publications. The ceiling may be no lower than 500' above
       the highest portion of prescribed pattern. The SFO pattern may be entered from any
       direction or altitude that will ensure the aircraft is properly configured prior to base key
       and in a position to safely complete the approach. An SFO will not be initiated or
       continued if a potential traffic pattern conflict exists which would require that the pilot
       divide attention between the SFO and sequencing with traffic. In addition, SFOs should
       be discontinued whenever excessive maneuvering is required, whether as a result of a
       traffic conflict or when making corrections. Once discontinued, a go-around will be
       initiated and no attempt will be made to re-enter or complete that pattern/approach. If
       flown to a dry lakebed, go-around must be started to descend no lower than 50 ft AGL.
       Full stop and touch-and-go landings may be flown by fully qualified pilots or by students
       under the direct supervision of an IP or EP. From the rear cockpit, only qualified IPs or
       upgrading IPs may fly SFOs and continue to touchdown. The aircraft must rollout wings
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                 57


     level at a point no lower than 200 feet AGL on final. Airspeed must be no slower than
     technical order minimum landing gear down airspeed until the sink rate is under control
     and landing is assured. If these parameters are not met perform a go-around.
     5.19.1.8. For all simulated emergency patterns include the type of simulated emergency
     in the ―gear down‖ radio transmission.
  5.19.2. Bomber, Cargo, Tanker.
     5.19.2.1. Before initiating any simulated emergency, the PIC/IP/EP will brief the cockpit
     crew on the condition to be simulated and state ―simulated‖ over the interphone
     communication system prior to accomplishment of each simulated emergency condition
     or as the simulated condition is established.
     5.19.2.2. Refer to Table 5.2 for additional restrictions. See attachment 11 for C-130
     restrictions and attachment 21 for UH-1 restrictions.

5.20. Fuel Jettisoning/Dumping. Fuel jettisoning will be conducted only to reduce aircraft
gross weight in an emergency, for operational necessity, or as required for flight test or FCF.
When circumstances permit, jettison fuel over unpopulated areas at an altitude above 5,000
AGL, when feasible. Advise the appropriate air traffic control agency of intention, altitude, and
location when fuel is jettisoned and when the operation has been completed. Units will establish
jettison areas and procedures to minimize the impact of fuel jettisoning into the atmosphere. Use
designated jettison areas and local area procedures to the maximum extent possible, except when
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                         59


safety of flight would be compromised. Refer to specific MD attachments for additional
guidance.
   5.20.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) The C/KC-135 aircraft commander is the approval
   authority for landing at gross weights above 200,000 pounds. Before jettisoning, tanker
   aircraft will contact their Unit Operations Desk and SPORT/Joshua Approach to determine if
   there are any receiver aircraft who can accept an offload of fuel.
5.21. Fuel Conservation. In addition to AFI 11-202 Volume 3 guidance, all AFMC aircrew
will utilize fuel conservation techniques in the conduct of their missions. Aircrew should
consider safety-of-flight first and maximize mission accomplishment while conserving fuel to
the maximum extent possible. Actions to consider include executing mission tasks at fuel
efficient airspeeds (such as maximum range or endurance), completing training events in
conjunction with test sorties, flying at lower gross weights, deleting unnecessary mission items,
etc..
5.22. Dropped Objects. If an object inadvertently departs the aircraft, the flight crew will
notify the controlling agency as soon as practical; include details of routing, altitude, winds aloft,
etc. After landing, notify maintenance and initiate appropriate safety processes.
5.23. Hazardous Conditions. Relay any safety hazard (e.g. icing, turbulence, thunderstorms,
bird concentrations etc.), through a Pilot Weather Report (PIREP) to the controlling agency.
5.24. Back Seat Landings. Only qualified or upgrading instructor pilots may conduct back seat
landings.
5.25. Touch-and-Go Landings – All Aircraft.
   5.25.1. Designated First Pilot (FPs) or MPs may perform touch-and-go landings at OG/CC
   designated airfields. IPs and EPs and MP/FPs under IP/EP supervision (on board the
   aircraft) may perform touch-and-go landings at any airfield that meets aircraft landing
   requirements. Only pilots touch and go qualified may perform touch and go landings.
   5.25.1. (EDWARDSAFB) Table 5.3 lists 412 OG/CC designated FP or MP touch-and-go
   airfields. Unit commanders may further restrict this list. The 412 OG/CC may authorize
   touch-and-goes at additional airfields not listed in Table 5.3 (i.e., deployed or test locations).
   5.25.2. Touch-and-go landings will not be flown with passengers onboard the aircraft.
   5.25.3. All engines will be set to military power or as specified in flight manual or MD
   attachment.
   5.25.4. Fighter and Attack. Touch-and-go landings will not be performed when configured
   with air-to-air missiles with live rocket motors or air-to-surface ordnance (live or inert) that is
   carted for release. Touch-and-go landings may be performed with live gun ammunition on
   board and the master arm in safe.
   5.25.5. Bomber, Cargo, Tanker. A current and qualified IP or touch-and-go certified MP
   must have access to the flight controls and brief the crew on procedures to be followed prior
   to executing the first touch-and-go landing of a training mission. Refer to Table 5.2 for
   additional restrictions.

   5.25.6. Unimproved Landing Surfaces. Touch and go landings will comply with flight
   manual and MD attachment procedures. Unless authorized by local procedures, touch and go
   landings on the lakebeds are prohibited.
   5.25.7. NVG Touch and Go. See MD attachments.

5.26. Post Arresting Gear Engagement Procedures: Do not shut down the engine unless fire
or other conditions dictate or directed to do so by the arresting gear crew. Do not raise the
tailhook or taxi until directed to do so by the arresting gear crew. Further procedures will be
conducted IAW local unit directives (if applicable).
5.27. Reduced Runway Separation (RRS). Local commanders are authorized to implement
RRS IAW AFI 13-203, Air Traffic Control, and minimum criteria established by HQ
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                      61


AFMC/A3O. If implemented, local RRS criteria and procedures should be published in the local
flying (11-series) directives. Questions regarding AFMC minimum RRS standards should be
directed to HQ AFMC/A3O.
5.28. Search and Rescue (SARCAP) Procedures. In the event an aircraft is lost in flight,
actions must begin to locate possible survivors and initiate rescue efforts. When establishing
SARCAP, care should be taken to not endanger the aircraft searching for the survivor(s) by
flying too low or slow in an attempt to visually acquire the survivor. Pilots should know their
aircraft limits and not unnecessarily place the aircraft so close to airspeed and power limits that
an unexpected encounter with a bird or civilian traffic could cause another accident. Safety of
the searching aircraft is paramount as channelized attention, target (wreckage) fixation, or
marginal weather conditions may expose the searching aircraft to unacceptable risks. The
following procedures are by no means complete and should be adjusted to meet each unique
search and rescue situation.
   5.28.1. Squawk. Immediately terminate maneuvering using appropriate Knock-It-Off
   procedures. Establish a SARCAP on-scene commander (OSC). IFF should be placed to
   EMER to alert ATC/GCI of the emergency situation.
   5.28.2. Talk. Communicate the emergency situation and aircraft intentions immediately to
   applicable control agencies. Broadcast an emergency distress call on GUARD. Establish
   communications with survivors on GUARD frequency or 282.8.
   5.28.3. Mark. Mark the last known position of survivor or crash site using any means
   available. TACAN, INS/GPS position, ATC/GCI positioning, targetting pod, or ground
   references should be used to identify the immediate area for subsequent rescue efforts.
   Transmit crash site location and the downed aircraft‘s call sign and type to controlling
   agencies. Pass on other pertinent information to rescue forces: number and condition of
   survivors, ordnance at crash site, weather conditions, signaling devices, etc.
   5.28.4. Separate. Remain above the last observed parachute altitudes until position of all
   possible survivors is determined. The OSC will de-conflict other aircraft assisting in the
   SARCAP by altitude to preclude midair collision. Direct non-essential aircraft to clear the
   area. Establish high and low CAPs as necessary to facilitate communication with other
   agencies.
   5.28.5. Bingo. Revise BINGO fuels or recovery bases as required to maintain maximum
   SARCAP coverage over survivors/crash site. Do not over-fly BINGO fuel. Hand off OSC
   duties, if needed. Relinquish SARCAP operation to designated rescue forces upon their
   arrival.
5.29. Flight Test Technique Restrictions. The minimum altitude for all FTTs is 1,000 feet
AGL, except for FTTs required to be performed at low-altitude (tower flyby, low altitude speed
course, speed soak, etc.) or an FTT approved by the safety and test review boards.
   5.29.1. Test Planning for Diving Maneuvers. For test points involving descents/dives that
   involve maneuvers which are not operationally representative or described in AFTTP 3-1 and
   AFTTP 3-3 series publications, or the sections of AFI 11-214 invoked by this AFI; test teams
   should consider Time Safety Margins (TSM). TSM is defined as the time in seconds to
   directly travel from the worst case vector (i.e. worst case combination of parameters: dive
62                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


  angle, attitude, airspeed, and available g that includes both planned and maximum allowed
  deviation/tolerance) to an unrecoverable condition.

Figure 5.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) TSM Diagram




  5.29.1. (EDWARDSAFB) Test Planning for Diving Maneuvers. For all test points that
  require or result in a dive (gamma less than 0º) and are not operationally published
  maneuvers flown IAW the procedures described in the basic AFI 11-2FTV3 or AFFTP 3-
  series publications, test teams will use the procedures outlined in Table 5.4 to minimize the
  risk of controlled flight into terrain (CFIT). Dive recovery planning and safety review board
  (SRB) requirements will be dependent upon the Time Safety Margin (TSM). See Figure 5.1
  for examples of TSM.
     5.29.1.1. The following sub-paragraphs describe general planning factors and limits that
     should be considered using TSM calculations.
     5.29.1.2. Abort/Recovery procedures will be based on no more than 90% of available
     aircraft limits at flight conditions, or 90% flight clearance authorized Nz loading,
     whichever is less. Also, no more than 90% of achievable roll rate will be used when
     calculating TSM.
     5.29.1.3. Normal g-onset rate will be in accordance with aircraft capabilities at the test
     conditions.
     5.29.1.4. All Normal g levels, roll rates and other assumptions used to calculate
     maneuver TSM will be briefed to the technical and safety review boards.
     5.29.1.5. Risk mitigation tools include: flight manual tabular data and modeling and
     simulation of dive recoveries to improve planning fidelity, defined and documented
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                   63


     recovery procedures, simulator or in-flight recovery procedure practice, recovery
     initiation back-up, etc. OGs will establish risk mitigation guidance for test planning that
     addresses the following TSM increments.
        5.29.1.5.1. TSM ≥ 8 seconds. Operations in this area are considered routine. Normal
        aircrew qualification is sufficient to mitigate the risk of CFIT. However, test teams
        must be alert for situations that may require additional risk mitigation. For example,
        maneuvers with high Nz loadings may delay a pilot‘s response to where TSMs
        greater than 8 seconds require significant risk mitigation.
        5.29.1.5.2. 8 > TSM ≥ 4 seconds. The risk of CFIT in this area requires the test
        team‘s attention.   Risk mitigation procedures should be tailored to the test
        requirements.
        5.29.1.5.3. 4 > TSM ≥ 2.5 seconds. The risk of CFIT in this area is elevated. Test
        teams should use aggressive risk mitigation.
        5.29.1.5.4. 2.5 > TSM ≥ 1.5 seconds. The risk of CFIT in this area is high. Test
        teams should use all reasonable tools to mitigate risk.
        5.29.1.5.5. TSM<1.5 seconds. Test operations in this area will not be conducted.

NOTES:
1. SRB will validate both the dive planning modeling and simulation (M&S) and the
planned recovery procedure for all recoveries other than routine.
2. The recovery procedure will be planned not to exceed 80% of available aircraft limits at
planned recovery flight conditions and to minimize any combination of high-g, g dwell
time, high-g onset, and rapid transition from negative to positive g.
3. Immediately initiate recovery after test point is complete.
4. Test team will document the planned test parameters, abort parameters and recovery
procedure, on flight test cards IAWAFFTCI 99-105, Test Control and Conduct.
5. In-flight buildup maneuvers will be accomplished with a minimum computed TSM of
eight seconds. Test teams will validate predictions via buildup points before proceeding to
test points.
6. Simulator rehearsal requirements will include practicing the complete recovery
procedure. SRB simulator rehearsal requirements may be waived on a case by case basis
by the test safety package approval authority.
7. Currency for the pilot flying the maneuver and critical test team members will be
determined by SRB, but no longer than 6 days for TSMs less than 2.5 seconds.
8. All available onboard altitude awareness devices will be briefed and used.
9. The recovery initiation back-up may be provided by an on-board safety crewmember, a
chase aircrew, or control room personnel.
10. At least one of the two recovery initiation back-ups must be external to the test aircraft.

   5.29.2. High-G Guidance. The following guidelines are to be used when flying test missions
   involving high-G maneuvers (defined as 7.0 Gs or greater). The term ―sustained high- G‖
   applies to a high-G loading duration longer than 5 seconds. The term ―short duration high-
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                    65


   G‖ applies to a high-G loading duration of 5 seconds or less. Adhere to the following limits
   when performing multiple high G test points:
       5.29.2.1. Sustained high-G test points: No more than eight sustained high-G test points
       per sortie.
       5.29.2.2. Short duration high-G test points: No more than 16 short duration high-G test
       points per sortie.
       5.29.2.3. When short duration and sustained test points are combined, the limits will be
       prorated. For example, one sortie may contain two sustained high-G test points (25% of
       the limit) and 12 short duration, high-G tests points (75% of the limit).
       5.29.2.4. The symmetric pull-up (lift vector above the horizon) FTT will be used, in lieu
       of maneuvering flight, when attempting to achieve load factors greater than 7.0 Gs below
       10,000 feet AGL.
5.30. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) To increase the safety margin for practice lakebed
landings, there is a crosswind limit of 50% of the flight manual limit for each aircraft
authorized to perform lakebed landings.This restriction only applies to practice landings for
training purposes.
5.31. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Engine Running Crew Change. A primary aircrew member
or qualified maintenance personnel should be positioned at the point of entry to act as a safety
observer and should be in interphone communication with the flight deck. If an aircrew member
is not positioned outside the aircraft, the onloading aircrew will not approach until given the
prebriefed visual signal. Adequate ear protection must be worn.
5.32. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Instructor Pilot (IP) Double Duty. To keep the quality of
instruction at a maximum and prevent task saturation, the following policies concerning
performing simultaneous IP duties for crewmembers in two seat fighter/attack/trainer aircraft are
in effect:
   5.32.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) An IP instructing a crewmember of another aircraft will
   not perform simultaneous IP duties within their own aircraft. This restriction does not apply
   when the IP status is required for non-rated aircrew.
   5.32.2. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) The IP will be in active control of their aircraft when
   providing instruction to another aircraft‘s crewmember, e.g. the crewmember in the other
   seat of the IP‘s aircraft will not fly the aircraft.
   5.32.3. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) The 412 OG/CC may waive these restrictions on a case-
   by-case basis. The request and decision must be made prior to the flight briefing.
5.33. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Flight Surgeons. Flight surgeons may carry medications
required for the performance of their duties in the aircraft.
5.34. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) To the maximum extent possible, aircrew will fly with a
tape or other applicable recording device on all sorties (if the aircraft is so equipped).
5.35. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) After Landing Procedures.
66                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


  5.35.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) De-arming is not required after weapons employment
  test or training sorties when all releasable weapons or chaff/flares have been confirmed
  released and no forward firing ordnance is armed.
  5.35.2. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Prior to engine shutdown, pilots will call Conform and
  squadron operations (if unit requires) with aircraft landing time and maintenance code.
  Definitions are as follows:
     5.35.2.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) CODE 1 - Aircraft is operational with no
     discrepancies.
     5.35.2.2. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) CODE 2 - Aircraft has minor discrepancies, but is
     capable of further mission assignment within normal turnaround flight.
     5.35.2.3. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) CODE 3 - Aircraft has major discrepancies in
     essential equipment, and/or safety of flight items, and requires corrective action prior to
     further flight.
  5.35.3. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Aircrew               will   debrief  maintenance     personnel
  immediately after landing. For specific system failures, attempt to talk to the appropriate
  specialist. If in doubt whether the aircraft requires impoundment, consult the maintenance
  production supervisor.
  5.35.4. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Debrief the ops supervisor regarding any unusual
  occurrences and write a brief description of the occurrence in the Unusual Occurrence Form
  (or unit equivalent).

military aircraft commander to be his or her own air traffic control (ATC) agency and to separate
his or her aircraft from all other air traffic. (See FLIP General Planning, section 7).
DZ Entry Point—A fixed point on DZ run-in course where an aircraft or formation or aircraft
may safely begin descent from IFR en route altitude to IFR drop altitude. The DZ entry point is
a maximum of 40 NM prior to the DZ exit point according to Federal Aviation Administration
FAR exemption 4371C. Formation descent will not begin until the last aircraft in formation is at
or past the DZ entry point.
DZ Exit Point—A fixed point on the DZ escape flight path centerline, established during pre-
mission planning, at which the formation will be at the minimum IFR en route altitude.
Calculate the exit point based upon three-engine performance at airdrop gross weight. This point
will be planned no less than four NM track distance beyond the DZ trailing edge.
Earliest Descent Point (EDP)—Earliest point in the DZ run-in course where the lead aircraft
may begin IFR descent to IFR drop altitude and be assured of terrain clearance for the entire
formation. Compute EDP by subtracting formation length from the computed DZ entry point.
Equal Time Point—Point along a route at which an aircraft may either proceed to destination or
first suitable airport or return to departure base or last suitable airport in the same amount of time
based on all engines operating.
End Maneuver Area (EMA)—A control point terminating the bomb run area.
Entry Control Time—The scheduled time over the Primary/Alternate Entry Control Point.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                      83


Entry Track—A track, usually associated with a bomber IR and beginning at the Primary or
alternate Entry Point, along which decent is made to the low altitude portion of the route.
Estimated Time In Commission (ETIC)—Estimated time required to complete required
maintenance.
Evaluation Form—Worksheet used to document any evaluation to prepare the AF Form 8.
Execution—Command-level approval for initiation of a mission or portion thereof after due
consideration of all pertinent factors. Execution authority is restricted to designated command
authority.
Familiar Field—An airport in the local flying area at which unit assigned aircraft routinely
perform transition training. Each operations group commander will designate familiar fields
within their local flying area.
Fix—A position determined from terrestrial, electronic, or astronomical data.
Fuel—
Normal Fuel—Fuel state on initial or at the final approach fix such that the aircraft can land
with the fuel reserves specified in AFI 11-202V3.
Minimum Fuel—Fuel state, where, upon reaching the destination, the aircraft can accept little or
no delay. This is not an emergency situation but merely indicates an emergency situation is
possible should any undue delay occur.
Emergency Fuel—Fuel state requires immediate traffic priority to safely recover the aircraft.
An emergency will be declared and the aircraft immediately recovered at the nearest suitable
field.
Global Decision Support System (GDSS)—AMC primary execution command and control
system. GDSS is used to manage the execution of AMC airlift and tanker missions.
Hazardous Cargo or Materials (HAZMAT)—Articles or substances that are capable of posing
significant risk to health, safety, or property when transported by air and classified as explosive

oxidizer and organic peroxide (class 5), poison and infectious substances (class 6), radioactive
material (class 7), corrosive material (class 8), or miscellaneous dangerous goods (class 9).
Classes may be subdivided into divisions to further identify hazard (i.e., 1.1, 2.3, 6.1, etc.).
Initial Cadre—Those personnel assigned to conduct flight testing of experimental,
developmental, or new aircraft for which there are no established formal training programs nor
standardized evaluation criteria. Initial Cadre designations are appropriate through Initial

entry to the route can be achieved to execute additional bomb/ECM/AGM runs.
Remotely Piloted Aircraft—Full scale (e.g. MQ-1/9, RQ-4) pilotless aircraft.
Restriction—A statement on the front of the AF Form 8 that places limitations on the duties that
may be performed by an aircrew, usually as a result of a failed ground or flight phase event. For
example, ―Restriction: Examinee will not fly unless under the supervision of an instructor pilot,
Day Only, Conus Only‖.
Route Abort Altitude—The Route Abort Altitude provides a minimum of 1,000 feet (500 feet
for helicopters and tilt-rotor aircraft conducting operations in the CONV/VTOL mode)
separation from the highest obstacle or terrain feature (rounded to the next highest 100 feet)

                                          Attachment 3
                              A-10 OPERATING PROCEDURES

A3.1. General Information. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives,
outlines procedures for operation of the A-10 aircraft under most circumstances. It applies to
AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of A-10 aircraft.
Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe,
effective mission accomplishment.
A3.2. Mission Planning: No additions.
A3.3. Common Mission Guidance.
   A3.3.1. Ground/Taxi Operations.
       A3.3.1.1. Pilots will be cleared by the crew chief prior to starting the Auxiliary Power
       Unit (APU), engines or actuating flight controls.
       A3.3.1.2. All flights require the bleed air function of the APU.
       A3.3.1.3. Aircraft stall warning devices will be fully operational for all flights.
   A3.3.2. Takeoff.
       A3.3.2.1. If RCR waived to 10, the following restrictions apply. When the RCR is less
       than 12, a run-up check will not be performed prior to brake release, the takeoff roll will
       not be started until the preceding aircraft is airborne, and if the crosswind component
       exceeds the RCR, takeoffs are prohibited.
       A3.3.2.2. If a VFR takeoff is required for mission accomplishment, the aircraft must be
       capable of achieving a minimum single-engine climb rate of 150-feet/minute (gear up,
       failed engine wind-milling, and all jettisonable stores-jettisoned), unless a higher rate of
       climb is required for unique obstacle clearance requirements. IFR takeoffs will be
       conducted IAW AFI 11-202V3. Aircraft operating under IFR that are unable to comply
       with the required minimum climb gradients may be required to reduce fuel and ordnance
       loads, cart all stores (except electronic countermeasures pods), or wait for environmental
       conditions to change. If operational requirements dictate, takeoffs may be made without a
       positive single-engine climb rate when approved by wing/group commander.
       A3.3.2.3. Join-up/Rejoin. Flight leaders will maintain 200 KIAS until join-up is
       accomplished unless briefed otherwise.
   A3.3.3. Formation Instrument Trail Departure Procedures.
       A3.3.3.1. Each aircraft/element will accelerate to 200 KIAS. Climb speed will be 200
       KIAS and power setting will be 800 degrees ITT unless specifically briefed otherwise.
       A3.3.3.2. Each aircraft/element will climb on takeoff heading to 1,000 feet AGL and
       accelerate to 200 KIAS before initiating any turns, except when departure instructions
       specifically preclude compliance.
   A3.3.4. Formation Approaches and Landings.              Do not perform practice formation
   approaches above 40,000 pounds gross weight.
92                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


  A3.3.5. Maneuvering Limits.
     A3.3.5.1. Confidence Maneuvers: Entry will be made at a minimum of 10,000 feet AGL.
     A3.3.5.2. Do not perform aerobatics below 5,000 feet AGL
     A3.3.5.3. Perform Stalls to recover above 5,000 feet AGL.
  A3.3.6. Air-to-Air / Air-to-Surface Weapons Employment.
     A3.3.6.1. Simulated, off range air-to-air and air-to-ground attacks requiring activation of
     the weapons release button with expendable training ordnance and/or suspension
     equipment are allowed if the following conditions are met: (1) MASTER ARM switch is
     in TRAIN, (2) Flight lead verbally confirmed training mode (―TRN‖ in the HUD or
     ―TRAIN‖ on the MFCD) and acknowledge throughout the flight, and (3) cold pickle
     check accomplished and acknowledged throughout the flight.
     A3.3.6.2. Simulated, off-range air-to-air and air-to-ground attacks (with 30mm TP
     loaded) requiring activation of the gun trigger are allowed if the following conditions are
     met: (1) MASTER ARM switch is in TRAIN, (2) GUN/PAC ARM switch is in SAFE,
     (3) flight lead verbally confirmed training mode (―TRN‖ in the HUD or ―TRAIN‖ on the
     MFCD) and acknowledged throughout the flight, and (4) cold trigger check accomplished
     and acknowledged through the flight (NOTE: With MA switch in TRAIN and GUN/PAC
     ARM switch in SAFE, pilots will have BATA but not PAC).
     A3.3.6.3. Refer to AFI 11-2A-OA-10 Volume 3 Chapter 5 for A-10A training
     switchology.
  A3.3.7. Air-to-Air Maneuvering Limits.
     A3.3.7.1. Pilots will not maintain an angle of attack (AOA) that triggers the chopped
     stall warning tone.
     A3.3.7.2. The minimum maneuvering airspeed during LOWAT is 240 KIAS.
     A3.3.7.3. Flaps will not be used as an aid to slow speed maneuvering.
  A3.3.8. Air-to-Surface Training Rules.
     A3.3.8.1. If airspeed decreases below 210 KIAS in a pop-up attack, abort the maneuver.
     Base this airspeed on typical training weights and configurations. At heavy gross weight,
     adjust abort airspeed upward to provide sufficient G and turning room to recover from an
     adverse flight condition.
     A3.3.8.2. Pave Penny Procedures. Pave Penny employment utilizes the concepts of a
     safety and optimum attack zones.
         A3.3.8.2.1. The safety zone is a 20-degree fan whose apex is at the target and
         extends 10 degrees either side of the target-to-laser designator line.
         A3.3.8.2.2. The optimal attack zone is a 120-degree fan whose apex is at the target
         and extends to 60 degrees either side of the target-to-laser designator line, excluding
         the safety zone.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                     93


          A3.3.8.2.3. Pave Penny will not be used as a sole source for target identification. In
          some situations, laser spots shift from the designated target to the laser source while
          operating in the optimal attack zone - precluding total reliance on the laser spot.
          A3.3.8.2.4. Attack heading should avoid the target-to-laser designator safety zone to
          preclude false target indications.
A3.4. Instrument Procedures.
   A3.4.1. The A-10 is Approach Category D. Accomplish missed approach in accordance with
   the flight manual procedures.
   A3.4.2. If using category C approach criteria, use 200 to 210 KIAS to meet missed approach
   airspeed.
   A3.4.3. Use of the Heads-Up Display. The HUD may be used as an additional instrument
   reference in night/IMC conditions; however, do not use it as the sole instrument reference in
   these conditions. In addition, do not use the HUD to recover from an unusual attitude or
   when executing lost wingman procedures except when no other reference is available.
A3.5. Operating Procedures and Restrictions.
   A3.5.1. Abnormal Operating Procedures
      A3.5.1.1. Fuel Imbalance: IAW flight manual guidance. Terminate the mission if fuel
      imbalance cannot be corrected. Instruments, navigation above 2,000 ft AGL, deployment
      missions, and level weapons deliveries above 2,000 ft AGL are authorized profiles to
      reduce gross weight.
      A3.5.1.2. Aircraft operating in the low altitude environment will climb to a prebriefed
      safe altitude (minimum 1,000 feet AGL) when a Knock-It-Off is called.
   A3.5.2. Practice of Emergency Procedures.
      A3.5.2.1. Accomplish all practice and/or training related to aborted takeoffs in the
      Cockpit Familiarization Trainer (CFT), Full Mission Trainer (FMT), or a static aircraft (if
      trainers unavailable).
      A3.5.2.2. Practice in-flight engine shutdown is prohibited (except during FCF profiles).
      A3.5.2.3. While airborne, simulated loss of both engines is prohibited.
   A3.5.3. Practice of emergency landing patterns at active airfields is authorized provided that:
      A3.5.3.1. Adequate crash rescue and air traffic control facilities are available and in
      operation.
   A3.5.4. Simulated Single Engine (SSE) Approach/ Landing.
      A3.5.4.1. Do not initiate simulated single engine failure below 1,000 feet AGL and
      terminate if the aircraft descends below 800 feet AGL prior to base leg.
      A3.5.4.2. Follow procedures in the flight manual for emergency landing patterns. Pilots
      will engage anti-skid prior to landing.
94                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


     A3.5.4.3. Pilots will plan approaches to avoid turns into the simulated dead engine when
     practical. If turns into the simulated dead engine are necessary, plan patterns to minimize
     bank angle.
     A3.5.4.4. SSE approaches will be discontinued if the airspeed decreases below computed
     single engine final approach speed.
  A3.5.5. Manual Reversion.
     A3.5.5.1. A thorough review of manual reversion procedures in the Dash-1 and/or Dash-
     6 will be accomplished before any flights where manual reversion is a mandatory part of
     the flight profile.
     A3.5.5.2. Other than actual emergencies requiring manual reversion, pilots will only go
     into manual reversion when on a dedicated FCF, FCF upgrade sortie, qualification
     training sortie, or during an approved test sortie via an approved test plan.
     A3.5.5.3. Manual Reversion Operations: If aircraft will not go into Manual Reversion or
     the pitch trim does not work, return Manual Reversion switch to NORM.
     A3.5.5.4. Manual Reversion Approach and Landing. Factors to consider are pilot
     proficiency, instrument approach facilities, runway conditions, weather at the recovery
     field, and any accompanying aircraft malfunctions. Controlled bailout is recommended
     any time existing conditions may preclude a safe recovery or during single engine
     operations.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                         95


                                          Attachment 4
                               B-1 OPERATING PROCEDURES

A4.1. General Information. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives,
outlines procedures for operation of the B-1 aircraft under most circumstances. It applies to
AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of B-1 aircraft. Operations
or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe, effective
mission accomplishment.
A4.2. Mission Planning.
   A4.2.1. Chart/Map Preparation. On low altitude training flights, one member of the pilot
   team, and both the Offensive Systems Officer (OSO) and Defensive Systems Officer (DSO)
   will carry a chart. Annotate headings and maximum/minimum route structure altitudes. The
   chart will be of scale and quality that terrain features, hazards, noise sensitive areas, and chart
   annotations are of sufficient detail to allow navigation and safe mission accomplishment.
   Review pilot's and OSO/DSO low altitude charts for compatibility and accuracy.
   A4.2.2. Fuel Requirements. When overhead a remote island with no alternate required,
   aircrew will use 40,000lbs as ―minimum‖ fuel for planning purposes. Overhead a remote
   island with an alternate required, use 60,000lbs for ―minimum‖ fuel.
A4.3. Common Mission Guidance.
   A4.3.1. Traffic Pattern Limitations.
       A4.3.1.1. See Table A4.1. for limitations and restrictions.
       A4.3.1.2. Practice no-flap or slat full stop landings are prohibited.
       A4.3.1.3. Practice pattern operations are prohibited under the following conditions:
          A4.3.1.3.1. Any engine shut down.
          A4.3.1.3.2. Unable to set military power on all four engines using normal throttle.
          A4.3.1.3.3. Any flight control problem
       A4.3.1.4. SCAS Failure. Normal touch-and-go landings or low approaches are permitted
       with a PITCH AUG 1, ROLL AUG 1, YAW AUG 1, and/or SPOILER 1 caution light
       illuminated.
       A4.3.1.5. Loss of all radar altimeter does not prevent transition work during day VMC.
   A4.3.2. FCF Operating Guidelines. The minimum crew for an FCF/Test mission consists of
   two pilots, an Offensive Systems Officer, and one person trained in CITS/EMUX operation.
   A qualified DSO/WSO must be on board if ECM systems are to be tested during the FCF.
   A4.3.3. Advanced Handling Characteristics/Advanced Handling Maneuvers (AHC/AHM).
       A4.3.3.1. Approach to Stall. Due to the increased stress placed on engines, approaches
       to stall will only be accomplished when required for FCF checks, instructor proficiency,
       upgrade training, or when required as part of a formal test program. The number of times
       the maneuver is repeated should be kept to a minimum. Terminate by 8,000 feet AGL to
       recover by 5,000 feet AGL.

                                         Attachment 5
                              B-2 OPERATING PROCEDURES

A5.1. General Information. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives,
outlines procedures for operation of the B-2 aircraft under most circumstances. It applies to
AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of all B-2 aircraft.
Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe,
effective mission accomplishment.
A5.2. Mission Planning.
   A5.2.1. Mission Briefing. If the interval from the initial briefing to takeoff exceeds 72
   hours, a complete review and briefing must be re-accomplished.
   A5.2.2. Personal Equipment. Crewmembers will wear gloves during engine start, takeoff,
   and landing.
A5.3. Common Mission Guidance.
   A5.3.1. Preflight.
       A5.3.1.1. For normal training missions, aircrew step to the aircraft should occur when
       the aircraft is crew ready, ideally no later than one hour thirty minutes prior to scheduled
       takeoff. Test mission pre-flights will be performed as required. Ensure all FLIP and
       classified materials are present, current, and complete.
       A5.3.1.2. Flight control BITs (ABIT). Pilots will complete an ABIT of the FCS after
       performing any flight control (FC) memory reads.
   A5.3.2. Ground/Taxi.
       A5.3.2.1. Induction Icing Ground Operations. If the ice detection system indicates ice
       and/or ice is noticed on the inlet areas, shutdown the engines as soon as possible
       minimizing throttle movement. The risk of engine FOD increases during continued
       operation in icing conditions longer than 5 minutes. If an ICING advisory occurs after
       brake release, crews may continue the takeoff and follow in-flight icing procedures.
       A5.3.2.2. Minimum taxi interval is 500 feet.
       A5.3.2.3. Taxi over cables from BAK-9/BAK-12 as slow as possible not to exceed 10
       knots ground speed.
   A5.3.3. Takeoff.
       A5.3.3.1. Unless a flight test requirement exists, do not takeoff if any of the following
       conditions exist:
          A5.3.3.1.1. Standing or pooled water on the runway.
          A5.3.3.1.2. The computed takeoff roll exceeds 80% of the available runway (can be
          waived by OG/CC).
          A5.3.3.1.3. The tailwind exceeds 10 knots (can be waived by OG/CC).
100                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


         A5.3.3.1.4. Any attitude indicator, heading indicator, or standby instrument is
         inoperative.
         A5.3.3.1.5. One or more engines are inoperative from the start of takeoff roll.
         During emergency evacuations and at the discretion of the wing commander or with
         higher headquarters approval, aircraft may takeoff with one or more engines
         inoperative. Under no circumstances should a crew take off with a computed takeoff
         distance that exceeds 95 percent of runway available.
         A5.3.3.1.6. Over any raised web barrier (MA-1A or 61QS11). Do not start takeoff
         roll prior to approach end cables. Takeoffs accomplished beyond approach-end
         cables are permitted provided at least the minimum runway length specified in
         Chapter 2 is available beyond the cable.
      A5.3.3.2. If CFL is computed to be greater than 80% of the available runway, aircrew
      will use full available thrust on takeoff (TRT) and have OG/CC approval for operations.
  A5.3.4. Formation. Because B-2 formation flight within AFMC is uncommon, users will
  refer to AFI 11-2B-2 Volume 3, B-2 Operations Procedures.
  A5.3.5. Chase Procedures. A safety chase is not required for flights that primarily occur
  under IFR control or in exclusive use airspace. A safety chase is not required for flights
  within the R2508 complex outside of high traffic areas (at or above FL350). A safety/photo
  chase will be used as required on test flights per the approved safety package.
  A5.3.6. Air Refueling.
      A5.3.6.1. Do not conduct air refueling with control stick steering engaged.
      A5.3.6.2. Do not conduct air refueling with an FCS CAUTION, except when necessary
      for safe recovery of the aircraft.
      A5.3.6.3. Do not conduct air refueling with less than four engines operating, except
      when necessary for safe recovery of the aircraft. Simulated engine out air refueling is
      permitted under IP supervision. Pilots will place no more than one throttle to idle to
      simulate the loss of one engine.
      A5.3.6.4. Do not conduct air refueling when the tanker has less than all engines
      operating, unless required for safe recovery of the aircraft.
      A5.3.6.5. Do not conduct air refueling when tanker aircraft is unable to retract landing
      gear.
      A5.3.6.6. Discontinue air refueling after loss of all tanker disconnect capability, except
      during the following conditions:
         A5.3.6.6.1. Emergency fuel situation or emergency evacuation. Limit contact time to
         that required to obtain fuel.
         A5.3.6.6.2. Flight test mission warranting the increased risk as agreed upon by the
         test director and aircraft commander. It must be accomplished under IP supervision.
         Limit contact time to that required to obtain fuel.
      A5.3.6.7. Do not accomplish breakaway training while in contact.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                      101


       A5.3.6.8. Boom envelope demonstrations require IP supervision.
       A5.3.6.9. Visual Observation Position. Using quick-flow procedures from the ATP
       56(B), the route/visual observation position may be used to expedite day, VMC AR
       operations. The position is defined as a 30-70 degree cone aft of tanker‘s 3/9 line, no
       closer than 150 feet (wing tip spacing) and no farther than 1,000 feet. Use of the position
       requires clearance by the tanker.
   A5.3.7. Landing.
       A5.3.7.1. Do not land prior to approach end cables. Landing beyond approach-end
       cables is permitted provided at least the minimum runway length specified in Chapter 2 is
       available beyond the cable.
       A5.3.7.2. See Table A5.1. for traffic pattern limitations.

Notes:
    1. Do not accomplish touch and go landings with any of the following:
        a) Any landing gear malfunction (including gear door malfunctions and nose wheel
           steering malfunctions)
        b) Any brake or anti-skid failure indications, any flight control caution or warning
        c) Center of gravity outside landing limits
        d) Runway length insufficient to abort a touch-and-go and stop in the remaining runway
    2. Minimum weather: Whichever is higher.
    3. Normal Master Mode Touch & Go landings with the speed brakes intentionally retracted
        require an IP and should only be accomplished as a part of a formal training syllabus.
    4. Initiate low approach/go-around no lower than 200 feet height above touchdown.
    5. Use four engines for non-briefed/unplanned go-arounds.
    6. Use of MCT or TRT for the low approach/go-around is at the discretion of the aircraft
        commander.
    7. Use all 4 engines for the ―go‖ portion of the Touch & Go.

  A5.3.8. Air-to-Surface Weapons Employment.
      A5.3.8.1. Do not release weapons if a release system, indicator, or weapon bay door
      malfunction exists, unless the malfunction is only a loss of redundancy which does not
      affect weapons accuracy or normal weapons release (e.g., single power drive unit
      controller failure).
      A5.3.8.2. While carrying weapons, do not conduct simulated bomb runs, unusual
      maneuvers (unless necessary for flight test), or other potentially hazardous activity.
      Carrying weapons does not preclude accomplishing air refueling. Touch and go's may be
      accomplished with inert weapons that are un-carted/pinned/inert separation nuts
      installed(all that are possible).
      A5.3.8.3. Do not complete weapon unlock/release enable/release consent for live or inert
      weapons until the aircraft is on the range, cleared HOT by the controlling authority, and
      weapons impact would be in the range danger area.
      A5.3.8.4. Do not open weapon bay doors during flight with weapons on board other than
      for intentional release, jettison, or if necessary for flight test (e.g. captive carry).
      A5.3.8.5. Do not practice simulated emergency procedures when weapons are loaded on
      the aircraft.
      A5.3.8.6. Do not perform partial simulated mode bombing with RLA weapons unless an
      RLA is in the weapons bay and as part of a syllabus directed training event. Do not
      ―manually‖ rotate RLAs in partial SIM without RLAs installed.
      A5.3.8.7. Weather Minimums/IMC Weapons Deliveries. If range procedures permit, B-
      2 pilots may release live or inert weapons in IMC. Unless further restricted by range
      guidance, B-2 aircrews will adhere to the following when conducting IMC operations or
      dropping through an undercast:
         A5.3.8.7.1. GPS FOM greater than or equal to 4 requires one OAP or target direct
         aiming on a 0.8 NM CM map. Without GPS and system buffers greater than 250 ft,
         one OAP within 5 minutes of release (or target direct aiming) on a 0.8 NM CM map
         is required.
         A5.3.8.7.2. For Coordinate only releases: Do not release if GPS FOM greater than or
         equal to 4. For non-GPS integrated releases, do not release if navigation system
         buffers are greater than or equal to 250 ft and buffer values have been verified via a
         0.8 NM CM map within 10 minutes of release.
      A5.3.8.8. Hung weapons procedures.
         A5.3.8.8.1. If pilots receive hung munitions indications, they will accomplish
         abort/post release checklist actions to safe the weapons, terminate all subsequent
         bombing activity scheduled for the sortie, and return to base or other suitable landing
         base, avoiding over-flight of populated areas.
         A5.3.8.8.2. Pilots will jettison weapons only if, in the opinion of the pilot in
         command, the retention of stores would adversely affect the safe recovery of the
         aircraft. After a successful jettison with suspected or known hung munitions, do not
         accomplish any further weapons delivery activity.

      A5.4.3.1. Lightning Strike/Static Discharge. In the event of a known or suspected
      lightning strike or static discharge, terminate the mission and maintain below 250 KCAS
      when practical.
      A5.4.3.2. Avoid thunderstorms laterally by 20 NM when below FL 200.
      A5.4.3.3. Avoid thunderstorms laterally by 40 NM when at or above FL 200.
      A5.4.3.4. When at or above FL 200, stay VMC when within 40 NM of any convective
      activity, not just thunderstorms, which have built above FL 200.
      A5.4.3.5. Avoid cruising at altitudes in IMC, or in areas of precipitation, that are within
      +/- 5,000 feet or +/- 10 degrees Celsius of the forecast or actual freezing level. Climb or
      descend through these areas as rapidly as is safely possible.
      A5.4.3.6. Do not climb or descend through forecast or reported icing conditions greater
      than light.
      A5.4.3.7. Do not cruise in any forecast or actual icing conditions.
      A5.4.3.8. Maintain Mach .65 or greater to minimize amount of ice accumulated (in icing
      conditions).
      A5.4.3.9. Minimize throttle movements with anti-ice/rain removal operating
   A5.4.4. INS/GPS/RVSM Flight.
      A5.4.4.1. RNAV and GPS approaches are not authorized.
      A5.4.4.2. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. Airspace where
      RVSM is applied is considered special qualification airspace. Both the aircrew and the
      specific aircraft must be approved for operations in these areas. All B-2As are approved
      for restricted operation within RVSM airspace as documented in Figure A5.1 B-2A
      RVSM Envelope Limitations. Refer to FLIP GP and the following guidance for
      additional RVSM requirements:
      A5.4.4.3. Required RVSM Equipment. Both altimeters (MDUs, one display before each
      pilot, and the standby altimeter), the autopilot altitude hold function, the IFF transponder
      altitude reporting (Mode C), and the flight control system (to include the air data ports
      and their heaters) must be fully operational (defined as not more than single channel
      failed) before entry into RVSM airspace. Should any failures of this equipment beyond
      the allowable single channel failure occur, immediately notify ATC and coordinate
      further clearance. If failure occurs before entering RVSM airspace, request a new
      clearance so as to avoid this airspace, or request ATC special handling as a non-equipped
      aircraft.
 104                              AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


          A5.4.4.3.1. Autopilot. The altitude hold function of the autopilot shall be engaged
          throughout level cruise periods in RVSM airspace, except when special
          circumstances dictate, such as when turbulence procedures require disengagement.
          Report any aircraft deviations greater than 130 ft from the commanded altitude to
          maintenance.
          A5.4.4.3.2. Altimeters. Crosscheck primary altitude displays with standby altimeter,
          before or immediately upon entry to RVSM airspace.
       A5.4.4.4. RVSM Operations. Monitor systems and crosscheck altimeters on primary
       displays to ensure they agree +/- 10 ft.
          A5.4.4.4.1. Aircrews should limit climb and descent rates to a maximum of 1,000
          feet per minute when operating in RVSM airspace to reduce potential effects on other
          aircraft‘s Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) operations, and to
          minimize risk of overshooting desired altitude during level-off.
       A5.4.4.5. Post Flight. Document (in the AFTO Forms 781) malfunctions or failures of
       RVSM required equipment, including the failure of this equipment to meet RVSM
       tolerances.

AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                   105


A5.5. Operating Procedures and Restrictions.
   A5.5.1. Brief all practice maneuvers or emergency procedures before the maneuver (either
   in-flight or during mission planning).
   A5.5.2. Do not practice compound simulated emergencies during critical phases of flight.
   A5.5.3. After taking the appropriate action to rectify a malfunction, resume training only if
   the designated pilot in command determines no hazard to safe aircraft operations exists. In
   an actual emergency, terminate all training and emergency procedures practice.
   A5.5.4. Brake and nose wheel steering malfunctions. Do not taxi the aircraft with a brake
   system malfunction. Do not taxi with a nose wheel steering malfunction with the exception
   of using nose wheel steering override, or differential braking to clear the active runway.
   After clearing the runway, the pilots will stop until the malfunction can be cleared. If nose
   wheel failure occurs in-flight and cannot be cleared or reset, aircrews may taxi the aircraft
   clear of the runway using NWS Override or differential braking and stop until the
   malfunction can be cleared.
   A5.5.5. Practice unusual attitude recoveries are prohibited in flight.
      A5.5.5.1. Nose High Recovery Procedure. To recover from a nose high attitude, add
      power as required, establish a bank angle of no more than 60 degrees, lower the nose to a
      minimum minus three degree pitch attitude, then return the aircraft to level flight in both
      pitch and bank.
      A5.5.5.2. Nose Low Recovery Procedure. Recover from a nose low attitude by reducing
      power and extending speed brakes as required, rolling wings level, then increasing stick
      back pressure to return the aircraft to level flight.

                                          Attachment 6
                            B-52 OPERATING PROCEDURES

A6.1. General Information. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives,
outlines procedures for operation of the B-52 aircraft under most circumstances. It applies to
AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of all B-52 aircraft.
Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe,
effective mission accomplishment.
A6.2. Mission Planning.
   A6.2.1. Low Altitude Charts. Each pilot team and each navigator team will carry a low
   altitude chart if the crew will conduct low altitude operations.
   A6.2.2. Takeoff Planning Criteria. A minimum of 1,000 feet overrun must be available in
   addition to the minimum runway required (MRR). When 1,000 feet of overrun is not
   available, reserve a portion of the runway to satisfy the minimum overrun requirements.
   Runway available for takeoff planning must be actual runway length minus any portion of
   the runway used to satisfy overrun requirements at the departure end of the runway.
A6.3. Common Mission Guidance.
   A6.3.1. Traffic Pattern Limitations.
       A6.3.1.1. Touch-and-go landings are authorized only under the following conditions:
          A6.3.1.1.1. Use a runway of sufficient width and length to permit a safe, normal full
          stop landing without the drag chute. Make the actual touchdown in the designated
          TDZ of the runway at a point and speed which would enable a safe full stop landing
          on the remaining runway. Initiate a go-around if this is not possible.
          A6.3.1.1.2. Non-IP aircraft commanders are limited to a maximum of 4 degrees
          crosswind crab.
          A6.3.1.1.3. Instructor pilots or aircraft commanders will brief (either in-flight or
          during mission planning) the individual being supervised on the following items prior
          to supervising touch-and-go landings.
              A6.3.1.1.3.1. Flight manual procedures.
              A6.3.1.1.3.2. The importance of smooth power application and stabilizing power
              before advancing throttles.
              A6.3.1.1.3.3. Compressor stalls, including proper preventive action, recognition,
              and corrective action.
              A6.3.1.1.3.4. Emergency jettison of drag chute.
              A6.3.1.1.3.5. Proper use of airbrakes and stabilizer trim.
              A6.3.1.1.3.6. Instructor Pilot (IP) or Aircraft Commander (AC) taking control of
              aircraft when necessary.
              A6.3.1.1.3.7. Unplanned go-around using all throttles.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                  107


     A6.3.1.2. Do not practice landings with less than 100 percent flaps, except where noted.
     A6.3.1.3. Normally, deploy the drag chute on all full stop landings. Should operational
     requirements dictate a full stop landing be made without a drag chute, comply with flight
     manual taxi back limitations.
     A6.3.1.4. Do not perform taxi back landings on wet runways.
     A6.3.1.5. See Table A6.1. for in-flight and traffic pattern limitations.
  A6.3.2. Flare Drop Activity.
     A6.3.2.1. Conduct live flare drop activity only in authorized special use airspace
     contained in current FLIP planning documents and over water firing areas.
     A6.3.2.2. Do not power the flare ejector system until within the approved flare drop area.
     A6.3.2.3. Do not accomplish low approaches or touch-and-go landings after making or
     attempting a flare drop. Touch-and-go's are authorized after munitions specialists confirm
     all flares were dispensed (none remaining). Do not attempt a taxi-back sortie with
     confirmed hung, retained, or misfired flares.
     A6.3.2.4. In case of an inadvertent flare drop, take the following actions:
         A6.3.2.4.1. Immediately safe the flare ejector system.
         A6.3.2.4.2. Record time and geographic coordinates of the inadvertent release.
         A6.3.2.4.3. Contact the applicable airspace controller and advise them of the
         incident, approximate location and estimated damage.
         A6.3.2.4.4. Units will develop local procedures to handle hung/hot flare situations if
         flares will be carried and/or expended in flight.
  A6.3.3. NVG Procedures.
     A6.3.3.1. The pilot flying the aircraft will use TA procedures, radar altimeter, and visual
     inputs gained from the NVG to maintain the proper terrain clearance. NVGs will not be
     used for visual contour low level or visual formation.
     A6.3.3.2. Cockpit Lighting. AFTTP 3-3.B-52 will be used as the baseline for proper
     NVG cockpit setup. Units may supplement this information. Approved lighting systems
     include the indigenous NVG cockpit lighting (C+ modification), cyalume light sticks, and
     an approved battery powered LED light bar. Always carry cyalume light sticks as a
     backup as they remain the most reliable means of cockpit lighting. Unless on an
     approved test plan, do not use NVGs without one of the cockpit lighting systems
     mentioned above.
  A6.3.4. Air-to-Surface Employment
     A6.3.4.1. The radar navigator/navigator is responsible for ensuring the proper ballistics
     are loaded for the target and the proper bomb code (B-XX) is input into Format 10 for the
     target destination.
     A6.3.4.2. Do not open bomb bay doors during flight with internal weapons on board
     other than for intentional release, jettison or if directed in an approved test plan.
108                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


      A6.3.4.3. While carrying internal weapons, do not simulate internal weapons release and
      while carrying external weapons, do not simulate external weapons release. Carrying
      weapons does not preclude accomplishing fighter intercept exercise, air refueling, and
      transition excluding touch-and-go landings and simulated engine-loss. Furthermore, it
      does not preclude accomplishing simulated external weapons or missile runs, with SMO
      simulations, while in "full sim" with actual weapons carried internally.
      A6.3.4.4. If all weapons were loaded externally in positions visible to the aircrew,
      releases may be visually confirmed by the aircrew in lieu of confirmation by an RCO.
      Internal light indications must be consistent with visual observation. Do not rely on visual
      inspections by other aircraft or non-range personnel to clear the aircraft for subsequent
      training activity.
      A6.3.4.5. If RCO confirmation of internal release is not possible, crews must perform a
      visual bomb bay check prior to conducting any additional training.
      A6.3.4.6. Any crewmember entering the bomb bay must be qualified and must avoid
      inadvertent contact with the release mechanisms.
      A6.3.4.7. Crewmembers will not enter the bomb bay to release bombs or to perform
      maintenance on release equipment.
      A6.3.4.8. Observe the following safety precautions for continued activity with retained
      weapons:
         A6.3.4.8.1. No weapons will be programmed against any target that is not within an
         approved training or test area.
         A6.3.4.8.2. Accomplish post release/abort checklist before conducting any
         subsequent training activity.
         A6.3.4.8.3. No release system, indicator, or weapon bay door malfunction may exist.
      A6.3.4.9. If release is verified by the RCO and internal light indications are consistent
      with RCO observations, aircrews may conduct additional training without restriction
      provided no weapons remain on the aircraft. The RCO must positively confirm the exact
      number of weapons programmed for release.
      A6.3.4.10. For internal weapons, aircrews will visually inspect the bomb bay if a hung
      weapon is suspected. If there are no weapons remaining on the aircraft, the aircrew may
      conduct additional training without restriction.
  A6.3.5. Low Altitude Operations.
  A6.3.5.1. Icing. Do not conduct low altitude flight in areas of forecast severe icing or in
  areas of reported moderate or severe icing conditions. If moderate or severe icing is
  encountered, abort the low altitude area.
      A6.3.5.2. Turbulence. Do not fly low level in areas of forecast severe turbulence. Do
      not fly low level with forecast moderate turbulence associated with mountain wave
      effects, or with moderate or severe turbulence reported by military aircraft. If aircraft
      type (military or civilian) reporting turbulence is unknown, contact appropriate ARTCC
      for advisory. If moderate or severe turbulence is encountered, abort the low level area.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                     109


     A6.3.5.3. Visibility/Cloud Clearance Requirements. Weather for TA operations on IR
     routes must be at or better than TA Visual Conditions (clear of clouds with 3 miles
     forward visibility). If TA Visual Conditions cannot be maintained, climb to MSA/IFR as
     soon as practical. Weather conditions for operations on VR routes must be 1500/3. If
     these weather conditions cannot be met, abort the route. For night operations, weather
     must meet the applicable day criteria. In addition, sufficient light and visibility must exist
     to recognize major changes in terrain elevations such as mountain peaks, ridgelines,
     valleys, and sloping terrain (NVGs may be used to satisfy visibility requirement).
     A6.3.5.4. Equipment Restrictions:
         A6.3.5.4.1. Mapping Radar Failure (Scope Blank or Inadequate for Navigation). Do
         not fly low level, during day IMC or night, with mapping radar failure. Aircraft
         without mapping radar may penetrate to low altitude during daylight hours provided
         TA Visual Conditions can be maintained and the RN or Nav station has an operating
         FLIP or STV display. Abort the route if weather conditions fall below TA Visual
         Conditions at any time.
         A6.3.5.4.2. OAS Processors. Do not fly low level without an operating OAS
         processor during night or IMC. Crews may penetrate to low level and fly the route as
         long as day TA Visual Conditions can be maintained.
         A6.3.5.4.3. Multi-Function Displays (MFDs). Do not fly low level unless there is at
         least one operable MFD at the RN or Nav station.
         A6.3.5.4.4. Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS). Do not fly low level with a
         malfunctioning AHRS. Exception: The AHRS does not need to be fully operational if
         one Inertial Navigation System (INS) is providing accurate heading and there is
         accurate MD-1 gyro stabilization for the pilot‘s attitude director indicator (ADI) (this
         exception applies for day TA Visual Conditions only).
         A6.3.5.4.5. Radar Altimeter. TA or EVS/visual contour flight without a properly
         operating radar altimeter is prohibited.
         A6.3.5.4.6. Additional Night Equipment Restrictions. The following equipment must
         be fully operational for night TA operations, with or without NVGs:
            A6.3.5.4.6.1. Mapping radar (for any night low level operation).
            A6.3.5.4.6.2. Terrain avoidance system.
            A6.3.5.4.6.3. Doppler/INS. Either Doppler or INS ground speed and drift
            information may be used.
            A6.3.5.4.6.4. EVS. Either Steer-able TV (STV) or Forward Looking Infrared
            (FLIR) must be operational for night TA operations.
            A6.3.5.4.6.5. Do not fly night TA if the aircraft performance is significantly
            degraded; for example, engine out or main gear extended.
  A6.3.6. Low Altitude Limitations.
     A6.3.6.1. Low altitude weight restriction is 230,000 to 420,000 pounds. These
     restrictions apply whenever the aircraft is operated at or below 5,000 feet above ground
110                                 AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


      level or during ocean surveillance/reconnaissance operations at or below 5,000 feet MSL.
      The minimum low altitude weight restriction does not apply to en route, cruise or traffic
      pattern operations.
      A6.3.6.2. Use of the autopilot non-steering modes, other than second station, is not
      recommended for low altitude operations. Do not use non-steering modes of the autopilot
      below 1,000 feet AGL except for the stab modes comparison check.
      A6.3.6.3. Bank angles during low level or operations below 1,000 feet AGL/ASL are
      limited to 30 degrees maximum. Use steep turn guidance as applicable for higher
      altitudes.
      A6.3.6.4. Normal minimum clearance plane settings: 300 feet day and 500 feet night.
      However, 200 feet clearance plane may be flown if necessary for the accomplishment of
      a test point or FCF. The time spent at this altitude will be kept to a minimum. The
      determining factor will be crew judgment, based on evaluations of aircraft equipment,
      weather conditions, aircrew capabilities, proficiency, and fatigue.
      A6.3.6.5. Do not conduct TA or EVS/visual contour flight without a properly operating
      radar altimeter.
  A6.3.7. TA Procedures.
      A6.3.7.1. Crewmembers must use all means available to clear terrain, including EVS
      equipment. Sound crew judgment must be used to determine whether current conditions
      warrant TA flight. If there is any doubt, the crew should climb to a safe altitude
      immediately.
      A6.3.7.2. Descent from IFR altitude must be accomplished in TA Visual Conditions. The
      PTAIP, or Start TA Point, is not a mandatory start descent point. The OAS radar will be
      in full scan TA (Plan Position Indicator {PPI} display or Displaced Center Plan Position
      Indicator {DCPPI} display) for all descents to TA altitudes. Range marks will be
      displayed to the maximum extent possible (N/A day Visual Flight Rules {VFR}).
      A6.3.7.3. TA flying under a cloud deck can be extremely hazardous, particularly under
      conditions of rising terrain or decreasing ceiling. In this case, climb immediately to
      MSA/IFR.
      A6.3.7.4. Attempt to maintain route centerline when flying at IFR altitudes without
      visual terrain clearance. Crews are not authorized to deviate from published route
      corridor except when aborting the route. NOTE: If a conflict arises between the pilot‘s
      and navigator‘s information, climb to a safe altitude and resolve it; obtain further flight
      clearance if necessary. If differences are resolved resume scheduled training activity.
      A6.3.7.5. If aircraft position is unknown, immediately climb to MSA/IFR altitude. If
      position cannot be determined after climbing to MSA/IFR altitude or any time route
      corridor has been exceeded, abort the route.
      A6.3.7.6. Whenever bank angle exceeds 15 degrees the pilot flying the aircraft will make
      the turn visually or, if at night, initiate a climb to a safe altitude before executing the turn.
      A6.3.7.7. Crews may omit the circled items of the Descent, After Descent, and TA
      Compensation checklist when weather conditions or time constraints prevent
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                     111


      accomplishment of the comparison/FRL compensation. During night mountainous
      conditions, crews will accomplish the entire checklist unless the TA set has been
      previously compensated.
      A6.3.7.8. Do not practice radar silent operations in IMC or at night.
   A6.3.8. Chase Operations.
      A6.3.8.1. It is unsafe to fly in close vertical proximity to another aircraft due to the
      interrelated aerodynamic effects. Never fly directly over or under another aircraft. The
      chase position for fighter/trainers chasing the B-52 is defined as:
      A6.3.8.2. Wings level position - at least 100 feet between wing tips or;
      A6.3.8.3. Stern position - approximately 1/4 mile behind and 100 feet below lead.
      A6.3.8.4. The normal chase position will be on the right wing of lead.
      A6.3.8.5. The lead aircraft must inform the chase aircraft and receive acknowledgment
      prior to initiating turns, climbs and descents, airspeed changes, or configuration changes
      (e.g. flaps, gear, airbrakes, etc.).
A6.4. Instrument Procedures.
   A6.4.1. Approach Category. The B-52 is normally approach category D. Category E is
   applicable when best flare plus ten knots or approach speed exceeds 165.
A6.5. Operational Limits And Restrictions.
   A6.5.1. Steep Turns. Except when otherwise required by an approved test plan, limit the
   maximum target bank angle to 45 degrees (not to exceed 60 degrees). The aircraft must
   remain clear of clouds throughout the maneuver. Do not perform steep turns during traffic
   pattern operations. For steep turns at or below 5,000 feet AGL/ASL, the following
   restrictions apply:
      A6.5.1.1. Weather must be day VFR.
      A6.5.1.2. Maneuver must be accomplished at or above 1,000 feet AGL/ASL with the
      flaps up. The aircrew will maintain at or above the minimum recommended airspeed or
      Mach for the planned bank angle throughout the maneuver.
   A6.5.2. Initial Buffet.
      A6.5.2.1. Perform initial buffet practice as prescribed in the flight manual and under
      instructor pilot supervision.
      A6.5.2.2. Pilots must review and discuss the correct recovery procedures and limitations
      for accomplishing initial buffet with the crew during mission planning.
      A6.5.2.3. Practice recovery from initial buffet at a minimum altitude of 20,000 feet
      above the terrain. If clouds exist between the aircraft and the terrain, the aircraft must be
      at least 10,000 feet above the tops of the clouds. Do not practice recovery from initial
      buffet above FL 300 or at gross weights above 300,000 pounds.
      A6.5.2.4. Perform the entire initial buffet maneuver with wings level.
      A6.5.2.5. Do not practice initial buffet with weapons or missiles loaded.

  A6.5.3. Fuel Minimums. In addition to the fuel requirements of chapter 2, the minimum fuel
  reserve for remote or island destination is 34,000 pounds. If weather conditions are such that
  an alternate airfield is required in accordance with AFI 11-202V3, then minimum fuel
  reserve is 54,000 pounds. The definition of a remote or island airfield is contained in AFMC
  Supplement 1 to AFI 11-202V3.
  A6.5.4. Air Refueling Limitations and Restrictions. Do not accomplish air refueling during
  training missions when two or more engines are shut down or when any engine has been shut
  down due to fire or fire indication. Also do not accomplish air refueling when the aircraft
  gross weight is less than 230,000 pounds .
  A6.5.5. Emergency Limitations.
      A6.5.5.1. If it becomes necessary to shut down two or more engines or one engine for
      fire or fire indication, abort the mission.
      A6.5.5.2. Refueling is not authorized with two or more engines inoperative or when any
      engine is shut down due to fire or fire indication, except when fuel is required to safely
      recover the aircraft.
      A6.5.5.3. Compute performance with one or more engines inoperative assuming the loss
      of another engine.
      A6.5.5.4. Aircraft with confirmed or suspected fuel leaks will abort the mission. Remain
      in the local area or proceed to the departure base or destination base by the most direct
      route. If circumstances permit, reduce to routine landing weight. Do not allow the center
      of gravity to exceed safe limitations or attempt any training activity, which would
      jeopardize safe recovery of the aircraft.
  A6.5.6. Fuel Quantity Indication System Failure. Normally, each fuel quantity indicator for
  each fuel tank must be fully operational. If a fuel quantity indicating system failure is
  discovered prior to flight, the following exceptions apply:
      A6.5.6.1. When a standard fuel load results in one or more empty tanks, the respective
      fuel quantity indicator for the empty tank need not be fully operational provided:
         A6.5.6.1.1. The tank will remain empty throughout the flight, including in-flight
         refueling.
         A6.5.6.1.2. The fuel quantity gauge indicates zero.
         A6.5.6.1.3. The circuit breaker for the respective indicator is pulled and a safety clip
         installed to prevent inadvertent resetting.
      A6.5.6.2. Aircraft may be flown with either one external or one outboard, but not more
      than one, wing tank gauge inoperative or malfunctioning, provided the following
      procedures are adhered to:
         A6.5.6.2.1. The aircraft is loaded with a standard fuel load.
         A6.5.6.2.2. The circuit breaker for the inoperative or malfunctioning gauge is pulled
         and a safety clip installed to prevent inadvertent resetting. In this situation, the pilots
         must realize that regardless of the gauge indication, the total fuel quantity indicator
         will be receiving indications that the tank is empty. Therefore, there will be a
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                   113


         discrepancy between the total fuel quantity indication and the actual amount of fuel
         on board.
         A6.5.6.2.3. The fuel flow indicator for that tank is fully operational.
         A6.5.6.2.4. Pilots must be particularly watchful when using fuel from a tank having
         an inoperative or malfunctioning fuel gauge since the only indication of fuel flow will
         be the fuel flow indicator light, lateral trim indications, and balance of fuel between
         main tanks one and four. The Fuel Quantity Indicating System (FQIS) sends a voltage
         to the total fuel quantity gauge rather than a restrictive value. When the circuit
         breaker is pulled, the indication to the total fuel quantity indicator from that gauge
         will be zero.
  A6.5.7. Aircraft/Aircrew Limitations
     A6.5.7.1. In B-52 aircraft, personnel occupying ejection seats may unstrap their
     parachute during non-critical phases of flight provided the ejection seat pins are installed
     (trigger ring stowed), seat belts remain fastened and adverse weather/turbulence is not
     expected. This does not preclude briefly vacating/swapping seats at safe clearance
     altitudes, pattern altitudes, or safe distance from tanker at the discretion of the PIC.
     Personnel not occupying ejection seats may unstrap their parachute during non-critical
     phases of flight. Instructors/evaluators not occupying ejection seats are exempt from
     wearing parachutes when performance of their essential duties makes wearing the
     parachute impractical. All crewmembers will wear helmets during initial takeoff/climb
     out, air refueling from 1/2 mile through termination of actual refueling operations, low
     altitude training routes, flight characteristics demonstration, flight below 10,000 feet
     MSL and any time an armed ejection seat is occupied. Pilots will have a visor down
     during any operations exceeding 300 KIAS below 10,000 feet MSL. If the visor
     interferes with the ability to see the instruments or terrain, minimize the time spent with
     the visor up.
     A6.5.7.2. Only the following compound practice emergencies are authorized with an IP
     in the seat.
         A6.5.7.2.1. Single Engine Loss on Takeoff following a Six Engine Landing see note
         3 Table 6.1
         A6.5.7.2.2. Six Engine Approach, Go-Around, or Landing in conjunction with an

                                         Attachment 7
                         E-3/E-8/B707 OPERATING PROCEDURES

A7.1. General Information. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives,
outlines procedures for operation of the E-3/E-8/B707 aircraft under most circumstances. It
applies to AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of all E-3/E-
8/B707 aircraft. Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if
they enhance safe, effective mission accomplishment.
A7.2. Mission Planning.
   A7.2.1. Melbourne Intl, (KMLB), performance data may be calculated using RCR 16 in lieu
   of RCR 10 per performance manual with a runway condition reported as "wet" without
   standing water. Use actual MU or RCR if reported by ATC, for performance calculations.
A7.3. Common Mission Guidance.
   A7.3.1. Crew Complement. Minimum aircrew complement will be commensurate with
   Flight Manual and /or mission specific requirements.
   A7.3.2. Maneuver Restrictions.
       A7.3.2.1. In-flight, prior to simulating emergency procedures (EP), the pilot will notify
       all crewmembers.
A7.3.2.2. In the event of an actual emergency, all student training and simulated EPs will be
terminated. Training will resume only when the pilot in command (PIC) has determined that no
hazard to safe aircraft operations exist.
A7.3.3. Prohibited Maneuvers.
       A7.3.3.1. This section adds aircraft limitations and restrictions to those already specified
       in flight manuals and applies to all aircrew. Unless on an approved test plan or an actual
       emergency exists, deviations from the aircraft flight manual are prohibited. The
       following maneuvers are prohibited:
          A7.3.3.1.1. Stalls
          A7.3.3.1.2. Zero Flap Landings
          A7.3.3.1.3. Dutch Roll (unless in approved lesson plan)
          A7.3.3.1.4. Simulated Emergency Descent
          A7.3.3.1.5. Simulated 3 engine, rudder power-off landings are prohibited
          A7.3.3.1.6. Simulated Compound Emergencies. (Excludes 3-engine, 25 degree flaps
          landing).
          A7.3.3.1.7. Actual practice engine shutdown (unless in approved lesson plan)
   A7.3.4. Landing Limitations. The following landing limitations apply to both touch-and-go
   and full stop landings:
       A7.3.4.1. All pilots will plan to land on centerline within the touchdown zone.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                    117


     A7.3.4.2. All touchdowns will be at a gross weight and at a point and speed that will
     permit a safe, full stop landing in the remaining runway. If this is not possible, initiate a
     go-around.
  A7.3.5. Engine Running Crew Changes. Unless otherwise published, use the following
  procedures. A crewmember should be positioned at the point of entry to act as a safety
  observer.     Crewmembers should approach and depart the aircraft from the nose.
  Crewmembers should ensure that all loose items are secure prior to entering and exiting the
  aircraft. Pilot in Command (PIC) will ensure that the aircraft is clear prior to taxi.
  A7.3.6. Air Refueling Limitations.
     A7.3.6.1. Do not accomplish AR operations when:
         A7.3.6.1.1. Conditions are encountered which, in the opinion of either aircraft
         commander or the boom operator result in marginal control of either aircraft.
         A7.3.6.1.2. Either the tanker or the receiver has less than the full number of engines
         operating.
         A7.3.6.1.3. The tanker aircraft is unable to retract the landing gear.
     A7.3.6.2. Tanker Autopilot. Conduct AR using all axes of the tanker autopilot except
     when either the tanker or receiver requires training with the tanker autopilot off or when
     the tanker autopilot is inoperative. Tanker pilots must notify the receiver pilot when any
     axis of the autopilot is not being used. For autopilot off tanker must have normal
     disconnect capability, unless fuel emergency exists.
     A7.3.6.3. AR without Tanker Disconnect Capability. AR without tanker disconnect
     capability means the boom operator is unable to get an immediate disconnect by
     triggering the disconnect switch. After a known loss of tanker disconnect capability with
     a particular receiver, no further contacts will be attempted with that receiver. The
     inability to get an immediate disconnect from one receiver by triggering a disconnect
     does not prohibit contact attempts with other receivers, if the tanker system (signal coil)
     checks good. However, if disconnects cannot be triggered on two successive receivers, no
     further contacts will be attempted unless required for the safe recovery of the aircraft.
     A7.3.6.4. Practice Maneuvers.
         A7.3.6.4.1. Restrictions. Practice emergency separations while in the contact
         position and demonstration of boom envelope limits are prohibited when the tanker
         has lost disconnect capability or during manual/emergency boom latching.
         A7.3.6.4.2. Maneuvers initiated from the contact position require that the tanker AR
         system be in normal, and a disconnect capability with the receiver must have been
         previously determined by a boom operator initiated disconnect
     A7.3.6.5. Practice Emergency Separation. Prior to the actual accomplishment of a
     practice emergency separation, coordination between the tanker pilot, boom operator, and
     the receiver pilot is mandatory. Coordination must include when the maneuver will occur
     and who will give the command of execution. Tanker pilot coordination may be
     accomplished over interphone with the boom operator. All crewmembers will be briefed
     on interphone prior to the practice emergency separation.
 118                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


       A7.3.6.6. Air Refueling Envelope Limits Demonstration. Prior to a limits demonstration,
       a disconnect capability must have been previously determined by a boom operator
       initiated disconnect.
       A7.3.6.7. Receiver AR Training. A qualified receiver IP will conduct training. The
       receiver pilot must inform and obtain acknowledgment from the tanker pilot and boom
       operator when an unqualified receiver pilot is receiving AR training. During this time, a
       boom operator qualified for the applicable category receiver must operate the boom
       controls, and if the tanker autopilot is off, the tanker must be flown by a pilot current and
       qualified in tanker AR.
   A7.3.7. Formation Flying. Formation is authorized IAW applicable technical order.
A7.4. Instrument Procedures.
   A7.4.1. The E3/E8/B707 is instrument category D.
A7.5. Operating Procedures and Restrictions.
   A7.5.1. Simulated Loss of Engines.
       A7.5.1.1. Perform practice or simulated loss of engines IAW this instruction, the
       applicable flight manual, and the following:
       A7.5.1.2. Simulated engine-out approaches may end in a missed approach, a full-stop
       landing, or a touch-and-go landing using all engines during the takeoff phase. A planned
       three-engine go-around may be started at any time before the power is reduced in the
       flare. If no IP or EP is onboard, the go-around will be initiated no lower than 200 feet
       AGL. Use all four engines as soon as safe and practical
       A7.5.1.3. Simulated two-engine approaches and landings will be practiced under IP
       supervision only. Simulated two-engine approaches can be practiced using two
       symmetric engines or three engines using two-engine procedures. Two-engine
       approaches and landings will not be practiced in an extensively modified aircraft.
       (Simulator only)
       A7.5.1.4. Simulated engine-out, rudder-power-off approach and go-around will not be
       accomplished unless an IP has briefed the maneuver prior to flight and an IP has access to
       a set of flight controls. The go-around will be started no lower than 200 AGL. For an
       unplanned go-around, use all four engines as soon as safe and practical. (Simulator only)
   A7.5.2. Practice Emergency Gear and Flap Operation. Accomplish day or night, clear of
   clouds.
   A7.5.3. Zero-Degree Flap Approach. Do not practice zero-degree flap approaches unless an
   instructor pilot has access to a set of flight controls and no emergencies (actual or simulated)
   exist. The approach will be terminated no lower than 200 feet AGL.
    AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                      119


                                              Attachment 8
                                   C-5 OPERATING PROCEDURES

    A8.1. General Information. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives,
    outlines procedures for operation of the C-5 aircraft under most circumstances. It applies to
    AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of C-5 aircraft. Operations
    or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe, effective
    mission accomplishment.
    A8.2. Mission Planning.
        A8.2.1. Obstacle Clearance Planning. Use AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217V1, and this
        instruction when planning an IFR departure. The Aircraft Commander shall provide the
        engineer with the following; planned IFR departure procedure, takeoff runway direction,
        length, slope, RCR/RSC, screen height, the height and distance of any known obstacles
        affecting departure path, and climb gradients (OEI and four engine).
        A8.2.2. Fuel Planning. On flights where a test plan does not dictate required fuel load, fuel
        planning is the responsibility of the aircraft commander.
    A8.3. Common Mission Guidance.
        A8.3.1. Taxi Procedures. Refer to Table A8.1 for taxi clearance criteria.

    Table A8.1. Minimum Taxi Clearance Criteria.

        A8.3.2. Aircrew Engine Running On-load/Offload/Crew change (ERO/ERCC). Aircrew
        will apply these procedures when conducting ERO/ERCCs through the crew entrance door.
        Crews should spend a minimum amount of time on the ground when accomplishing an ERO
        or ERCC. Aircraft commanders will brief crewmembers on the intended ERO/ERCC
        operation. The parking brake will be set and at least one pilot in the seat will monitor brakes,
        aircraft systems, interphone, and command radio. As a technique, operate engines in the
        lowest thrust setting necessary. Prior to landing, the loadmaster or scanner will brief
        personnel in the cargo compartment regarding their locations, duties, and responsibilities
        during the ERO/ERCC. During enplaning or deplaning, station a crewmember on interphone
        (cord held taut) at approximately 20-30 feet and 45 degrees from the aircraft axis to establish
        a visual reference between personnel and the running engines. No deplaning/enplaning
        personnel should approach the airplane until this crewmember is in place. Brief
        deplaning/enplaning personnel to remain forward of the interphone cord and ensure hearing
        protection is used. Use wing leading edge lights, taxi lights, and landing lights to enhance
        safety at night as the situation dictates.

   A8.3.3. Observer. Use available crewmembers to assist in outside clearing during all taxi
   operations and any time the aircraft is below 10,000 feet MSL.
   A8.3.4. Landing Gear and Flap Operating Policy. The pilot flying (PF) will command
   configuration changes. The pilot monitoring (PM) will verify appropriate airspeed and
   configuration prior to echoing the gear or flap actuation command. All gear operation will be
   activated by the pilot in the right seat and all flap operation will be activated by the PM.
   A8.3.5. Flight Engineer Procedures. All flight engineers assigned to AFMC will use the
   following guidance when operating C-5s, regardless of location. This guidance contains
   normal procedures for flight engineers (FE) not contained in the flight manual or applicable
   technical orders (TO).
       A8.3.5.1. Authority to Clear Red X Symbols in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance
       Discrepancy and Work Document. A first engineer or above may clear red Xs for fan
       stops, pitot covers, gear pins, engine cowlings, exterior panels and single-point refueling
       (SPR) drains when qualified maintenance personnel are not available.
       A8.3.5.2. Aircraft Servicing.
A8.3.5.2.1. Refueling and De-fueling. Flight Engineers are authorized to refuel and de-fuel
when maintenance personnel are not available. The applicable refueling and de-fueling checklist
shall be used during all refueling and de-fueling operations. If ground support personnel are not
available, the aircraft commander will designate other crewmembers to assist the FE. Aircrews
will not refuel at bases with AMC support except in isolated cases when maintenance support is
not readily available and the mission would be delayed.
           A8.3.5.2.2. Refueling at Nonsupport Stations. When crewmembers are required to
           refuel due to lack of maintenance support, two refueling qualified personnel and an
           additional individual for scanner or safety duties are required. The additional
           individuals will be briefed on duties by the refueling team supervisor. EXCEPTION:
           If left and right SPRs are used, two qualified personnel and two additional individuals
           are required.
       A8.3.5.3. Weight and Balance. The flight engineer performing scanner duties is
       responsible for completing the DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F,
       when loadmasters are not on board and/or one has not been done through other means
       (i.e.- Canned DD Form 365-4, etc.).
       A8.3.5.4. Aircraft Structural Integrity Program. The purpose of this program is to
       provide a reliable system for predicting potential or impending failures based on
       historical records of the aircraft's exposure to those actions contributing to fatigue
       failures.
           A8.3.5.4.1. The program is monitored through the use of AF IMT 4097, Aircraft
           Identification.
           A8.3.5.4.2. Flight engineer will:
              A8.3.5.4.2.1. Ensure all applicable sections of AF IMT 4097 are completed
              according to procedures in paragraph A8.3.5.4.3.
              A8.3.5.4.2.2. Always leave a newly initiated form on the aircraft.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                 121


              A8.3.5.4.2.2.1. Initiate a new form by completing section I.
              A8.3.5.4.2.2.2. Place all completed AF IMT 4097s in aircraft stowage pouch
              along with newly initiated form.
              A8.3.5.4.2.2.3. Ensure all completed AF IMT Forms 4097 accompany the
              aircraft back to home station with its records and turn into maintenance at
              debrief.
       A8.3.5.4.3. AF IMT 4097 instructions.
          A8.3.5.4.3.1. The AF IMT 4097 will be closed out after each sortie, runway
          abort, or landing on a substandard runway. The criteria in AFI 11-401, and
          MAJCOM supplement, pertaining to sorties, landing, and flying time entries
          made in the AFTO 781 by the pilot in command apply, with the following
          exceptions:
              A8.3.5.4.3.1.1. Do not start a new log for in-flight mission symbol changes.
              A8.3.5.4.3.1.2. Do not start a new log for practice full stop landings at a point
              other than the point of takeoff.
              A8.3.5.4.3.1.3. Start a new log when the aircraft remains on the ground more
              than 20 minutes after touchdown, regardless of circumstances.
          A8.3.5.4.3.2. Weights. Except for section VI, enter weights to the nearest
          thousand pounds. Always right adjust the three columns. For example, enter a
          weight of 94,500 pounds as 095. For section VI, enter values in thousands and
          tenths of thousands, such as 94.5 for the above example.
          A8.3.5.4.3.3. Altitudes. Enter altitude to the nearest thousands of feet in section
          III. Enter altitude as thousands and tenths of thousands of feet in section V. The
          decimal point is on the form. (EXAMPLE: Enter 24,600-feet as 24.6 in section
          V.)
          A8.3.5.4.3.4. Accuracy and neatness are essential. All numbers and letters must
          be legible. Do not use diagonal marks (/) on zeroes.
              A8.3.5.4.3.4.1. Section I, Aircraft Identification. Complete an AF IMT 4097
              for each sortie or condition as defined in paragraph A8.3.5.4.3.1. Do not
              complete a log for any ground operation or sortie that does not involve an
              attempted takeoff. This includes ground aborts for maintenance, operations,
              weather, and on-load or off-load exercises. When a sortie is terminated before
              an attempted takeoff, transcribe the section I information contained on the log
              to a new AF IMT 4097. Use the same log number.
               A8.3.5.4.3.4.1.1. Effective Date. The Zulu date the form is started. For each
               mission departure from home station, the AFTO 781J, Aerospace Vehicle-
               Engine Flight Document, will contain the correct information for the
               effective date and columns 1-20 in a special block. This information will be
               used for confirmation. All discrepancies on the AF IMT 4097 will be
               corrected to agree with the AFTO 781J.
               A8.3.5.4.3.4.1.2. Columns 1-3. Aircraft tail number: Enter the last 3
122                    AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


       numbers of the aircraft's serial number.
       A8.3.5.4.3.4.1.3. Columns 4-8. Log number: Only one log number will be
       used for each sortie flown. Place the year in columns 4-5. Right adjust the
       remaining three digits, ending in column 8. Unused columns should contain
       zeroes. No dashes are permitted. EXAMPLE: The ninth log of the calendar
       year 2005 would be entered as 05009.
       A8.3.5.4.3.4.1.4. Column 9. Normally, the letter "A" will be entered in this
       column. (EXCEPTION: Enter C when ALDCS is off; enter D when air
       refueling with a KC-10 tanker and ALDCS is off; enter E when air refueling
       with KC-10 tanker and ALDCS is on.) In instances when additional AF IMT
       4097s are needed (i.e. aborted takeoff, aircraft remaining on the ground
       more than 20 minutes after an intermediate landing, landings on substandard
       runways), add a suffix letter beginning with B through Z with the exception
       of C, D, and E explained above. (EXAMPLE: Initial log number 05011A,
       aircraft aborts takeoff for a door warning light on--initiate new log with
       number 05011B. Aircraft makes a full stop landing with taxi back for
       another takeoff, but is delayed on the ground over 20 minutes--initiate a new
       log with number 05011F. The mission is then completed after further flight.
       The aircraft has flown one sortie and has used one log number although
       three AF IMT 4097s are completed.) NOTE: When an AF IMT 4097 is
       initiated for a flight that is aborted on the runway during an attempted
       takeoff resulting in mission termination, the form will be completed as much
       as possible. Include the reason for the abort in the remarks section.
       A8.3.5.4.3.4.1.5. Columns 10-12. No entries will be made in these columns.
       A8.3.5.4.3.4.1.6. Columns 13-17. Airframe hours: To nearest hour. Decimal

                 A8.3.5.4.3.4.2.2.1. Columns 42-44. Fuel weight: Fuel weight at engine
                 shutdown or 5 minutes after final touchdown, whichever comes first, to
                 the nearest thousand pounds. NOTE: This entry and the fuel entry
                 (columns 30-32) are extremely important and must be accurate. The
                 chronological event (cruise periods, touch-and-go (T&G), intermediate
                 full stops and takeoffs) fuel weight is computed using the initial takeoff
                 and final landing fuel weight.
                 A8.3.5.4.3.4.2.2.2. Columns 45-48. Time Z: Sortie landing time as

                 designation (4 letters) for the airfield at which the final landing occurred.
                 If no ICAO code is listed for an airfield, leave blank and annotate the
                 name of the airfield of landing in the remarks section.
                 A8.3.5.4.3.4.2.2.4. Column 53. Substandard runway: Enter an "X" if the
                 runway is not asphalt or concrete.
                 A8.3.5.4.3.4.2.2.5. Column 54. Fuel sequencing: Enter "S" for standard
                 fuel sequence; enter "N" for nonstandard fuel sequence. When "N" is
                 entered, make an entry in the remarks block to indicate fuel quantity in
                 each tank containing fuel, and the total flight time spent in nonstandard
                 configuration.
            A8.3.5.4.3.4.3. Section III , Flight Profile Data.
              A8.3.5.4.3.4.3.1. This section allows for four separate cruise periods. Do
              not enter temporary cruise periods of less than 15 minutes (due to clearance
              changes, weather, etc.). Entries are required for low-level clean
              configuration events where a cruise period time and altitude is held longer
              than 5 minutes at 6,000-feet mean sea level (MSL) or lower. Neither traffic
              nor the climb or descent portions of the sortie are to be entered. These
              entries are to be made left-to-right in chronological time sequence as they
              occur. The first cruise period start time should begin after the initial climb
              and cruise is stabilized. Cruise period stop times should be entered when one
              of the following events occur:
124                    AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


           A8.3.5.4.3.4.3.1.1. Climb or descent in excess of 4,000-feet from
           recorded altitude is initiated.
           A8.3.5.4.3.4.3.1.2. Altitude increases by more than 4,000 from the last
           recorded value. This may occur when multiple step-climbs (less than
           4,000-feet each) are performed.
           A8.3.5.4.3.4.3.1.3. Cruise Mach number is stabilized at 0.10 from the
           last recorded value. NOTE: Climb and descent criteria will normally
           govern when to close out a cruise period. The Mach number change
           criteria is possible during aerial refueling operations and turbulence
           encounters.
       A8.3.5.4.3.4.3.2. Subsequent cruise periods should begin when
       Mach/altitude conditions are stabilized. The stop time for the last
       chronological cruise entry indicates scheduled cruise has ended and descent
       for landing follows. NOTE: Cruise entries are not required if the entire
       flight remains in the initial takeoff airfield's traffic pattern. (See section II,
       columns 37-40.) However, a cruise entry will be required when:
           A8.3.5.4.3.4.3.2.1. The traffic pattern altitude (6,000-feet MSL) is
           exceeded, regardless of time duration.

                  A8.3.5.4.3.4.6.1. Flight Duration:
                     A8.3.5.4.3.4.6.1.1. Landing time: Enter the ending Zulu landing time.
                     A8.3.5.4.3.4.6.1.2. Takeoff time: Enter the initial Zulu takeoff time.
                     A8.3.5.4.3.4.6.1.3. Total time: Enter the total flight time in hours and
                     minutes.
                     A8.3.5.4.3.4.6.1.4. Total time: Enter the total flight time in hours and
                     tenths. NOTE: The takeoff and landing time entries in sections II and
                     VI should be identical and should be the same as recorded in the AFTO
                     781 for the sortie being reported. (See paragraph A8.3.5.4.3.1. for
                     exceptions.)
                  A8.3.5.4.3.4.6.2. Takeoff Weight Computation. Complete the takeoff
                  weight computation portion when computing takeoff requirements. The
                  operating weight and cargo, passenger, and miscellaneous weight entries
                  should not change. The fuel weight at brake release is subject to change due
                  to unforeseen delays. The FE need not readjust section VI entries in case of
                  delays. The FE should always enter the corrected fuel weight and gross
                  weight at takeoff in section II. NOTE: LN2 weight will be included in the
                  aircraft operating weight.
                  A8.3.5.4.3.4.6.3. Remarks: Enter any appropriate comments that could
                  influence aircraft fatigue factors. Examples are: severe turbulence
                  encountered, hard landing, nonstandard fuel sequence, high load maneuvers,
                  unpressurized flight, and in-flight thrust reverser operation. If active lift
                  distribution control system (ALDCS) is off or inoperative in flight, record
                  the conditions and flight duration. Record the appropriate sequence number
                  from section V, In-flight Operations Data, of any AR event occurring behind
                  the KC-10. EXAMPLE: "KC-10 A/R, seq XX" where "XX" is the
                  sequence number. Other required remarks are mentioned in the various
                  section instructions. NOTE: If all blocks for a specific maneuver are
                  completed and additional blocks are needed, use another AF IMT 4097 for
                  continuation. Use same log number and annotate in the remarks section of
                  the continuation form, ―Continuation of log number XXXXX.‖
      A8.3.5.5. Fault Code Reporting Procedures:
         A8.3.5.5.1. The Fault Reporting Method (FRM) is used to isolate system
         malfunctions with a minimum amount of troubleshooting and provide a description of
         the malfunction for maintenance.
         A8.3.5.5.2. System malfunctions, whether monitored by Malfunction Analysis
         Detection and Recording (MADAR) (auto or manual) or observed by a crewmember,
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                     127


         will be troubleshot using the fault reporting method (FRM) or fault isolation manual
         (FIM) procedures contained in MADAR to the maximum extent possible.
         A8.3.5.5.3. The manual fault code (FC) from the troubleshooting routine and the auto
         fault code reported by MADAR will be recorded in AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance
         Discrepancy and Work Document, along with the description of the malfunction.
         Include any additional information required for clarification of the discrepancy.
     A8.3.5.6. Monitoring Primary Radios. The FE will monitor the primary radio for flight
     clearances, altitudes, heading changes, and radio frequencies. The FE is not required to
     copy departure clearances.
     A8.3.5.7. Scanner Duties. After takeoff, the scanner will normally make a walk-around
     when flaps are retracted, the after-takeoff climb checklist has been initiated, and the
     airplane is clear of turbulence. The walk-around should be completed by 10,000 feet.
     EXCEPTION: When the scanner is sitting in the jump seat, he or she will remain there
     until 10,000 ft., unless coordinated with the pilot to clear off earlier for the after takeoff
     climb scan.
     A8.3.5.8. Wheel and Brake Procedures. If dragging wheels or brakes are suspected
     during taxi, or after the Anti-Skid check, deplane the scanner and another crewmember, if
     available, and proceed as follows.
         A8.3.5.8.1. Maintain interphone contact throughout the inspection.
         A8.3.5.8.2. To inspect, approach directly from the front or rear of the tire, touch main
         landing gear tire and cautiously move the hand toward the wheel. Then place the
         hand near the brake to determine excessive heat without touching the brake surface.
         Repeat for each main landing gear (MLG) wheel and brake assembly.
         A8.3.5.8.3. If any brake is significantly hotter than the majority, advise maintenance
         that corrective action is required. If an obviously dangerous overheated condition is
         observed, do not taxi the airplane.
         A8.3.5.8.4. If no brake is found significantly hotter than the majority of brakes, the
         brake check is satisfactory.
  A8.3.6. Runway, Taxiway, and Airfield Requirements.   In all cases ensure obstacle
  clearance requirements are met. Computed landing distance will not exceed runway
  available.
     A8.3.6.1. Runway Length for Takeoff/Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, takeoffs will be
     initiated from the beginning of the approved usable portion of the runway. Decision to
     make intersection takeoffs rests solely with the AC. Intersection takeoffs may be
     accomplished provided the operating environment (i.e. gross weight, obstructions, climb
     criteria, weather, etc.) will allow safe takeoff and departure. When less than the entire
     runway is used, takeoff and landing data (TOLD) card computations will be based on
     actual runway remaining from the point at which takeoff is initiated.
  A8.3.7. Arresting Cables.
 128                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


       A8.3.7.1. Do not land on (touchdown on) approach end arresting cables (does not
       include recessed cables). If the aircraft lands before the cable, the crew should contact the
       tower to have the cable inspected.
       A8.3.7.2. Do not takeoff or land over an approach end cable that has been reported as
       slack, loose, or improperly rigged by NOTAM, automated terminal information service
       (ATIS), or ATC.
   A8.3.8. Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews will not normally attempt to
   recover an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto unprepared surfaces not suitable for taxi;
   ground crews will accomplish aircraft recovery.
A8.4. Instrument Procedures.
   A8.4.1. Aircraft Category. The C-5 is approach Category D.
   A8.4.2. Data Insertion. Another pilot will verify flight plan or waypoint data inserted into
   the FMS/MCDU. Check both the coordinate information and the distances between
   waypoints against the route of flight.
   A8.4.3. Use of Automation.
       A8.4.3.1. In flight, the PF will determine the most desirable level of automation for the
       given situation. However, the PIC still has the ultimate responsibility and authority for
       the safe operation of the aircraft.
       A8.4.3.2. One pilot should always remain heads up. One technique is to announce ―pilot
       heads down‖ or ―copilot heads down‖ when the task requires focusing significant
       attention on the FMS/MCDU in flight.
       A8.4.3.3. Extensive programming of the FMS/MCDU below 10,000 feet and during
       critical phases of flight should be avoided, especially during times of increased workload.
       A8.4.3.4. To maximize situational awareness, the PF should verbalize automation mode
       and level changes to the crew. Confirm inputs by observing the desired result.
       A8.4.3.5. Any system which increases situational awareness, such as EGPWS, TCAS or
       WX radar, should be operated by the PM at the direction of the PF.
   A8.4.4. FMS 800 Operations.
       A8.4.4.1. Normally the PM will make FMS inputs, especially at low altitudes (e.g. below
       10,000 feet). When work load and phase of flight permit, the PF may make FMS inputs.
       Coordinate route changes between pilots to ensure accuracy.
       A8.4.4.2. Autopilot. When the autopilot is engaged, the PF should operate the autopilot.
       The PM should only make inputs as directed by the PF.
   A8.4.5. AMP Operations.
       A8.4.5.1. Normally the PM will make MCDU inputs, especially at low altitudes (e.g.
       below 10,000 feet). Changes which alter the flight path should be verified by the PF prior
       to execution.
       A8.4.5.2. AFCS operation is governed by the autopilot status with consideration given to
       aircraft altitude.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                   129


          A8.4.5.2.1. With the autopilot engaged, the PF should make all changes to AFCS
          modes and settings. EXCEPTION: The Altitude Select Window is set by the PM. In
          all cases the new altitude setting will be verbally confirmed with the PF.
          A8.4.5.2.2. With the autopilot disengaged, the PM should make all AFCS inputs at
          the direction of the PF. However, when receiving ATC vectors or altitude change
          clearances, the PM should set assigned headings or set the new altitude and await the
          PF‘s instructions to engage HDG SEL mode or a vertical mode.
      A8.4.5.3. The following standard terminology will be used:
          A8.4.5.3.1. SELECT, SET or ENGAGE directs the selection of a value and/or a
          mode on the AFCS panel which results in the value being placed in the ―engaged‖
          (top green) portion of the FMA. SELECT or SET is normally used with rotary knobs,
          however ENGAGE is acceptable.
          A8.4.5.3.2. ARM directs the selection of a mode on the AFCS panel which results in
          the value being in the ―armed‖ (bottom, cyan) portion of an FMA.
          A8.4.5.3.3. ENGAGE should be used to request autopilot or autothrottle
          engagement.
          A8.4.5.3.4. UP or DOWN should be used to indicate a change in vertical speed.
          A8.4.5.3.5. EXECUTE should be used by the PF to indicate agreement with a
          programmed change to the flight path.
          A8.4.5.3.6. PRESET or PRESELECT should be used to change an AFCS value
          without changing the engaged or armed mode
      A8.4.5.4. The Altitude Select Window is set by the PM. The commanded altitude
      depends on the vertical mode to be used for the climb/descent. If using VNAV, the PF
      may elect to call for the highest level cleared in a climb or the lowest level cleared in a
      descent. This will allow VNAV management of the climb profile for intervening altitude
      restrictions. If not using VNAV, set current altitude clearance. Do not preselect a
      subsequent altitude until an altitude hold or altitude capture FMA is displayed and
      clearance to that altitude has been issued. At no time should an expected ATC clearance
      be set in the Altitude Select Window.
   A8.4.6. Autopilot and Auto-throttle Use. C-5 AMP aircraft auto-throttles are approved for
   use during climb, cruise, descent, and approach. C-5 FMS-800 aircraft auto-throttle use is
   restricted to the approach phase only.
      A8.4.6.1. The autopilot will be disconnected no later than DH, departing the MDA, or
      300' for visual approaches.
      A8.4.6.2. The auto-throttles will be disconnected no later than DH or 100' at all other
      times.
A8.5. Operational Procedures and Restrictions.
   A8.5.1. Passenger Procedures. The aircraft commander has the discretion to release seats for
   passenger accommodations. Passengers can be carried on the flight station (jump seat or
   navigator‘s seat), in the relief crew area, or in the courier compartment. Any additional
130                                 AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


  members on the aircraft must have an oxygen source and a seat/seat belt for all phases of
  flight and ground operations. One additional current and qualified C-5 crewmember must be
  on board when carrying passengers other than on the flight deck. This crewmember will
  perform only passenger-related duties. Passengers will not normally be carried in the troop
  compartment. If passengers are carried in the troop compartment, obtain qualified
  loadmasters and reference AMC guidance contained in AFI 11-2C-5, Volume 3 for any
  specific requirements.
  A8.5.2. Cargo procedures. Cargo will not normally be carried. If cargo is carried, obtain
  qualified loadmasters and reference AMC guidance contained in AFI 11-2C-5, Volume 3 for
  any specific requirements. Parachute racks, survival equipment and a single B-1 stand are
  not considered cargo. Ballast for SCM-modified aircraft is not considered cargo. Small
  items capable of being hand-carried up the crew entrance ladder are also not considered
  cargo.
  A8.5.3. Wind Restrictions. Airfields will be considered below minimums for takeoff and
  landing when winds (including gusts) are greater than: Maximum wind (any direction)—50
  knots; Maximum tailwind component—10 knots; Maximum crosswind components,
  corrected for RCR, are specified in TO 1C-5A-1-1.
  A8.5.4. Prohibited Maneuvers. The following maneuvers are prohibited in the aircraft unless
  they are part of an approved test plan or aircraft recovery plan:
      A8.5.4.1. Simulated/actual engine out takeoffs.
      A8.5.4.2. Aborted takeoffs.
      A8.5.4.3. Two engine out landings and missed approaches.
      A8.5.4.4. Stop and go landings.
      A8.5.4.5. No slat landings.
      A8.5.4.6. Full stalls.
      A8.5.4.7. Dutch rolls.
      A8.5.4.8. Unusual attitudes / spatial disorientation training.
      A8.5.4.9. Simulated runaway pitch trim malfunctions.
  A8.5.5. Training Restrictions.
      A8.5.5.1. No Flap Landing. Perform no flap landings to a full stop only. Maximum
      crosswind component will not exceed 15 knots. Limit gross weight to 525,000 lbs or less.
      A8.5.5.2. Stallimeter Training. All practice approach to shaker onset/audible warning
      must be done in day, VMC only conditions at an altitude greater than 10,000 ft AGL with
      an instructor pilot in the left or right seat.
         A8.5.5.2.1. For practice approach to shaker onset, recover the airplane at shaker
         onset or the lowest acceptable computed shaker onset airspeed, whichever occurs
         first.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                     131


          A8.5.5.2.2. For practice approach to audible warning, recover the airplane at audible
          warning or the highest acceptable computed audible warning AOA, whichever occurs
          first.

   A8.5.6. Equipment Limitations.
      A8.5.6.1. Objective. Redundant systems may allow crews to safely perform some
      missions when a component/system is degraded. The Pilot in Command (PIC) is the final
      authority in determining the overall suitability of an aircraft for the mission. The PIC will
      ensure a detailed explanation of the discrepancy is entered in the AFTO Form 781A,
      Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document; include the following maintenance
      identifiers to effectively communicate aircraft status:
          A8.5.6.1.1. Mission Essential (ME). The PIC will designate an item, system, or
          subsystem component essential for safe aircraft operation or mission completion as
          ME.
          A8.5.6.1.2. Mission Contributing (MC). The PIC will designate an item, system, or
          subsystem component, which is not currently essential for safe aircraft operation as
          MC. These discrepancies should be cleared at the earliest opportunity. If
          circumstances change or mission safety would be compromised, re-designate as ME.
          Do not delay a mission to clear a MC discrepancy.
          A8.5.6.1.3. Open Item (OI). The PIC will designate discrepancies not expected to
          adversely impact the current mission or any subsequent mission as an OI. These items
          are normally cleared at home station.
      A8.5.6.2. Minimum Equipment List (MEL) Policy. The MEL is a pre-launch document
      listing the minimum equipment/systems to operate the aircraft. It is impractical to prepare
      a list that anticipates all possible combinations of equipment malfunctions and contingent
      circumstances. Consider equipment/systems with no listed exceptions as grounding
      items. A PIC who accepted an aircraft with degraded equipment/systems is not
      committed to subsequent operations with the same degraded equipment. PICs are not
      committed to operations with degraded equipment accepted by another PIC.
132                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


         A8.5.6.2.1. The PIC shall account for the possibility of additional failures during
         continued operation with inoperative systems or components. The MEL is not
         intended for continued operation over an indefinite period with systems/subsystems
         inoperative.
         A8.5.6.2.2. All emergency equipment will be installed unless specifically exempted
         by mission requirements/directives.
      A8.5.6.3. Hydraulic Systems. The aircraft will not be flown with more than one
      hydraulic pump on two nonadjacent engines inoperative. If flown in this configuration,
      all PTUs shall be operative, and system filters shall be checked to ensure the system is
      not contaminated. All pumps shall have positive depress capability.
      A8.5.6.4. Landing Gear. If a gear-down flight becomes necessary, make an AFTO Form
      781 entry after the flight requiring inspection of the extended gear(s) prior to the next
      flight to include the associated gear-well areas, LN2 servicing panel and doors. Nose
      landing gear inspections include the kneeling door supporting actuators, brackets, and
      bulkhead assembly.
      A8.5.6.5. Fuel System.
         A8.5.6.5.1. If a main tank boost pump is inoperative, cross-feed and isolation valves
         shall be operational.
         A8.5.6.5.2. Auxiliary tank boost pumps, one pump per tank may be inoperative.
         Both pumps may be inoperative in each tank if the tank is not serviced with fuel
         and/or the refuel valve is not leaking fuel back into the associated tank.
         A8.5.6.5.3. Extended range tank boost pumps, one pump per tank may be
         inoperative. Both pumps may be inoperative in each tank if the tank is not serviced
         with fuel and/or the refuel valve is not leaking fuel back into the associated tank.
         A8.5.6.5.4. The aircraft will not be flown with more than one inoperative fuel
         quantity indicator for each wing (symmetrically opposite indicator in the other wing
         shall be operative).
      A8.5.6.6. Electrical System.
         A8.5.6.6.1. One engine driven generator may be inoperative provided the bus tie
         system is operative.
         A8.5.6.6.2. One Constant Speed Drive (CSD) may be inoperative and disconnected,
         provided the bus tie system is operative. The oil level of the disconnected CSD will
         be checked for proper oil quantity prior to flight and during all subsequent en route
         stops. Do not fly more than 50 hours with a disconnected CSD (non-waiverable).
         A8.5.6.6.3. Central Air Data Computer (CADC). CADC Replacement – These
         procedures apply when one CADC system has not been disturbed. If computer
         failure, as opposed to a pitot static system failure, is confirmed and a new CADC is
         installed, a leak check is not required. Crosscheck pilot and copilot airspeed
         indicators at 80 knots on takeoff roll. Abort the takeoff if airspeed differs by five
         knots or more. Exception: Maintenance leak and accuracy checks are required
         before flights in RVSM airspace.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                               133


        A8.5.6.6.4. Micro Inertial Reference System (Micro IRS). May be inoperative as
        long as there are three sources of attitude. Both EGIs and standby attitude indicator
        (SAI) shall be operational. Shall be repaired at next repair capable station.
        A8.5.6.6.5. Embedded Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation System (EGI).
        Three sources of attitude required. Micro IRS and standby attitude indicator (SAI)
        shall be operational. Shall be repaired at next repair capable station. GPS function
        may be inoperative.
        A8.5.6.6.6. Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). One INS may be inoperative for
        navigation provided the attitude function is operative. The fully operational units
        should be installed in the number 1 and 3 positions.
        A8.5.6.6.7. MADAR. One SAR channel indicating a vibration (fan or core) out of
        limits and one SAR channel indicating within limits suggests an indicating system
        malfunction. To determine if an indication malfunction exists apply the following:
            A8.5.6.6.7.1. If channel 08 mil value is more than 2.5 times greater than the
            channel 09 mil value or the channel 09 value is more than 1.1 times greater than
            the channel 08 value, an indicating system malfunction exists.
            A8.5.6.6.7.2. If an indicating system malfunction exists, the usable channel
            indicating vibration within limits will be used. Record the system malfunction as
            a discrepancy as in the AFTO Form 781A.
            A8.5.6.6.7.3. If an indicating system malfunction does not exist, the usable

                              C-12 OPERATING PROCEDURES

A9.1. General Information. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives,
outlines procedures for operation of the C-12 aircraft under most circumstances. It applies to
AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of C-12 aircraft.
Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe,
effective mission accomplishment.
A9.2. Mission Planning.
   A9.2.1. Briefing/Debriefing.
       A9.2.1.1. C-12 Paradrop mission briefings will be conducted with a qualified
       jumpmaster and will begin NLT 1 hour prior to scheduled takeoff. C-12J will not
       conduct actual Paradrop missions.
A9.3. Common Mission Guidance.
   A9.3.1. Taxi. Instructor pilots may run engines and taxi the aircraft, as a single pilot.
   A9.3.2. Reverse Taxi.
       A9.3.2.1. The pilot will coordinate reverse taxi directions and signals with the crew
       chief, marshaller or scanner (any qualified C-12 aircrew member).
       A9.3.2.2. The crew chief or scanner will be outside the aircraft and positioned to
       effectively direct the reverse taxi.
       A9.3.2.3. The reverse motion should be stopped using forward thrust before the brakes
       are applied in order to prevent the aircraft empennage from contacting the ground.
   A9.3.3. Takeoff/Landing Requirements.
       A9.3.3.1. Compute takeoff and landing data for all flights. OG/CC-approved tab data
       may be used when available.
       A9.3.3.2. Minimum runway length. In no case will a takeoff be performed if the runway
       available is less than ACCL/STOP distances adjusted for RCRs. Minimum runway for
       touch and go‘s is 5000 ft for the C-12C/D and MC-12 and 6000 ft for the C-12J.
   A9.3.4. Chase Operations. Chase operations are defined as flights involving similar or
   dissimilar aircraft performing maneuvers with a ―non-cooperative‖ lead aircraft (i.e.
   moderate banked turns, shallow climbs, and descents) from a route or trail position
       A9.3.4.1. Chase Restrictions.
       A9.3.4.2. Day VMC only.
       A9.3.4.3. No wing takeoff or landings.
       A9.3.4.4. Minimum ATC wake turbulence criteria applies when chasing larger aircraft.
       A9.3.4.5. Minimum lateral spacing is one-half the wingspan of the largest participating
       aircraft.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                     137


   A9.3.5. Airdrop Procedures. The C-12J is prohibited from airdrop operations. The C-12C is
   authorized to airdrop personnel out of the rear main cabin entry door. The following
   guidelines apply:
      A9.3.5.1. Maximum airspeed is 205 knots with the airstart door removed.
      A9.3.5.2. Airdrop configuration is 40% flaps or 100% flaps and gear as necessary.
      A9.3.5.3. Minimum airspeed is 100 knots with flaps 40% or 90 knots with flaps 100%.
      A9.3.5.4. A loadmaster is not required to be on board the aircraft when the jumpmaster is
      from the AFFTC test parachute program.
      A9.3.5.5. The minimum exit altitude for free fall is 2500 ft AGL.
      A9.3.5.6. The minimum emergency exit altitude is 1000 ft AGL.
      A9.3.5.7. Below 1000 feet AGL all airdrop personnel will have lap belts securely
      fastened.
A9.4. Instrument Procedures.
   A9.4.1. Approach Category. The C-12 is approach category C.
A9.5. Operating Procedures and Restrictions.
   A9.5.1. Maneuvering Parameters.
      A9.5.1.1. Unusual Attitudes. Perform unusual attitudes at an altitude that will allow
      recovery not lower than 5,000 ft AGL and avoid exceeding bank angles of 60 degrees and
      pitch attitudes of + 25 degrees.
      A9.5.1.2. Stall Characteristics. Recover the aircraft at the first indication of stall
      warning or actual stall during stall demonstrations. During stall training under an
      approved syllabus, instructor pilots may allow the trainee to recover the aircraft at the
      first indication of aerodynamic stall. Perform all practice stalls and stall recoveries above
      5,000 ft AGL.
      A9.5.1.3. Practice Engine Shutdown/Restarts. Actual engine shutdowns and restarts for
      practice will only be accomplished during training under an approved training syllabus or
      during FCF proficiency training with the restrictions imposed by table 5.2. Prior to
      engine shutdown, the pilot in command will verify that the altitude for the planned engine
      shutdown does not exceed the single engine service ceiling.
      A9.5.1.4. Engine Failure Immediately After Takeoff. Simulated engine failures
      immediately after takeoff may only be performed after a positive rate of climb is attained,
      the aircraft is above the safe single engine airspeed defined in the appropriate flight
      manual, and the aircraft is capable of meeting the published climb gradient or at least a
      3.3% single engine climb gradient (200 ft/nm), if not published.
      A9.5.1.5. No Flap Landings/Touch and Go‘s. C-12s have no restrictions on No Flap
      landings or touch and goes. This is a normal flap setting and may be accomplished
      without an IP or EP.
138                            AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


      A9.5.1.6. Touch and Go‘s. Without a C-12 qualified IP or EP onboard, both MPs must
      be MP Touch and Go certified in order to perform actual touch and go events in the
      aircraft.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                139

 Modification Flight Manual
A10.3. Common Mission Guidance.
   A10.3.1. Functional/Acceptance Check Flights. FCFs and ACFs will be performed
   according to T.O. 1-1-300 and applicable MAJCOM instructions (i.e., 21-XXX series).
   Additional guidance can be found in T.O.s 00-20-6, 1C-17A-6CF-1 and 1C-17A-1.
       A10.3.1.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Ram Air Turbine (RAT) Check Procedures.
       Aircrews are authorized to perform the RAT extension check in accordance with the
       procedures listed in T.O. 1C-17A-6CF-1, Acceptance and Functional Check Flight
       Procedures Manual. A copy of this T.O. will be provided to the aircrew by maintenance
       personnel upon arrival at the aircraft. The following additional restrictions apply:
          A10.3.1.1.1. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) A RAT flight check requires a current and
          qualified instructor pilot on the aircraft.
          A10.3.1.1.2. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Do not flight check the RAT when landing
          crosswinds exceed 15 knots or landing gross weight exceeds 400,000 lb.
          A10.3.1.1.3. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) After an in-flight check of the RAT,
          perform one normal ¾ flap full stop and return.
140                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


  A10.3.2. Formation Procedures. Visual formation, to include chase and target support, is
  authorized with similar and dissimilar aircraft. Station Keeping Equipment (SKE)/Formation
  Flight System (FFS) formation will be flown in accordance with lead-command guidance to
  the maximum extent possible.
  A10.3.3. NVG Procedures
      A10.3.3.1. Aircraft/Aircrew Preparation. Test aircraft T-1 requires significant cockpit
      preparation for flight with NVGs. During the walk-around inspection, a pilot will ensure
      all wheel well inspection lights are turned off.
      A10.3.3.2. NVG Donning/Doffing. Donning and doffing of NVGs will be initiated by
      the aircraft commander as briefed. For non-NVG landings, cease NVG usage 5 minutes
      prior to activity to regain adequate night visual acuity.
      A10.3.3.3. Takeoff and Landing Requirements. Use airfield marking patterns IAW AFI
      13-217 appropriate to runway conditions. Preflight study of the airfield environment is
      key for successful NVG visual approaches.
      A10.3.3.4. Slowdown through Escape (airdrop only). If either pilot‘s NVGs fail,
      continuing the airdrop will be at the aircraft commander‘s discretion. As a guide, if the
      DZ is in sight and CARP alignment has been confirmed between the PF and PM, the
      airdrop may be continued.
      A10.3.3.5. Takeoff, Approach and Landing. During an NVG takeoff, if the PF
      experiences NVG failure, takeoff may be continued at the discretion of the aircraft
      commander; otherwise an abort will be initiated. If NVG malfunctions occur after Vgo,
      takeoff will be continued with the other pilot assuming control of the aircraft if necessary.
      If either pilot‘s NVGs fail after takeoff, continue the climbout and transfer aircraft control
      to the pilot with operable NVGs. Strong consideration should be given to continuing the
      flight on autopilot. During an approach, if either pilot experiences NVG failure below
      500‘ AGL, perform a go-around. If the PF‘s NVGs fail during or after touchdown,
      transfer control to the PM for the landing rollout.
  A10.3.4. Air Drop. Unless used in conjunction with drop execution, avoid use of the word
  GREEN after the Combat Entry Checklist and until completion of the Combat Exit Checklist.
  ―GREEN LIGHT‖ will be seen or heard by the loadmaster for all drops.
      A10.3.4.1. NVG airdrop operations can include drops into unmarked drop zones.
      Mission requirements will dictate the release method used.
      A10.3.4.2. Jumpmaster directed and pilot directed airdrop without logic may be
      accomplished provided the drop zone is visually acquired and the jumpmaster or both
      pilots determine that the load will land within the confines of the drop zone.
  A10.3.5. Low Level Navigation
      A10.3.5.1. Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) / Terrain Alert Warning System
      (TAWS).
         A10.3.5.1.1. For operations in day VMC conditions, with terrain and obstacles
         clearly in sight, the PF will call runway and/or terrain in sight, state intentions and
         visually clear terrain.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                       141


          A10.3.5.1.2. For operations at night or in IMC, if an aural warning is heard,
          immediately and simultaneously rotate the aircraft to establish a climb while rolling
          wings level, and add power until the warning has ceased and adequate terrain
          clearance is verified. WARNING: Do not delay pull-up for diagnosis of the low
          altitude warning. Failure to roll wings level during the maneuver described above will
          decrease stall margin at heavy aircraft gross weights.
          A10.3.5.1.3. Ensure the mode of the GPWS/TAWS is commensurate with the
          aircraft‘s phase of flight.
   A10.3.6. Flight Test Mission
      A10.3.6.1. TPS Curriculum. TPS qual eval flights will be conducted under the guidelines
      in the Qual Eval Review Board (QRB) documentation. Normal mission elements may be
      conducted under the supervision of an IP. All other mission elements and FTTs will be
      conducted under the supervision of an IP who is a TPS graduate.
A10.4. Instrument Procedures.
   A10.4.1. The C-17 is approach category D.
   A10.4.2. Simulated Instrument Flight. Artificial vision restricting devices are not authorized
   for any phase of flight. Simulated instrument flight may be flown and logged without the use
   of a vision-restricting device.
   A10.4.3. Approaches. Crews are cleared at any time to fly approaches to published
   minimums (or unit specified minimums, whichever is higher) using raw data, flight director,
   or autopilot/auto-throttles. EXCEPTION: Mission Computer (MC) approaches are cleared
   for day/night VMC. For MC approaches in IMC refer to AFI 11-2C-17 Vol 3 for guidance.
A10.5. Operating Procedures and Restrictions.
   A10.5.1. Minimum Equipment List.
      A10.5.1.1. Due to the unique requirements of the test mission, the aircraft commander, in
      concert with inputs from maintenance, engineering, instrumentation, etc., will be the final
      authority on mission status.
      A10.5.1.2. It would be impractical to prepare a list that would anticipate all possible
      combinations of equipment malfunction and contingent circumstances. This section lists
      the equipment and systems considered essential for routine as well as test operations.
      The list does not necessarily include all equipment or systems essential to airworthiness
      (e.g. rudder, ailerons, elevators, flaps, tires, etc.). For this MEL, a local area departure is
      defined as a planned full stop landing outside the local Edwards AFB flying area.
      A10.5.1.3. The aircraft commander is responsible for exercising the necessary judgment
      to ensure no aircraft is dispatched with multiple items inoperative that may result in an
      unsafe degradation and/or an undue increase in crew workload. The possibility of
      additional failures during continued operation with inoperative systems or components
      shall also be considered. This section is not intended to allow for continued operation of
      the aircraft for an indefinite period with systems/subsystems inoperative.
      A10.5.1.4. Engine performance, aircraft attitude, vertical velocity indications, altitude,
      speed, and heading instruments should be operative in both pilot positions.
142                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


      A10.5.1.5. Aerial Delivery Systems. The PDM, TRM, Rail Bridge Assembly and Ramp
      Edge Cover will be operational for equipment airdrop missions. The retrieval winch(es),
      GRMs and BSA will be operational for CDS airdrop missions.
         A10.5.1.5.1. The retrieval winch(es), Canadian Retrieval System, paratroop door(s),
         and air deflector door(s)/pod fairing(s) will be operational for personnel airdrop
         missions.
         A10.5.1.5.2. The ADSC, LFCP, LACP, PADS, and all proximity sensors and
         indicating systems associated with these items will be fully operational for all airdrop
         missions.
      A10.5.1.6. AFCS Panel. AFCS panel will be operational for all departures. If the
      autopilot or auto-throttles are inoperative, comply with a 12 hour crew duty day limit.
      A10.5.1.7. Air Conditioning, Pressurization, and Environmental Systems.
         A10.5.1.7.1. One air conditioning pack will be operational for avionics cooling.
         A10.5.1.7.2. If the wing isolation valve fails closed en route, all engine pneumatic
         supply SOVs will be operational, and all en route stops will have the capability to
         manually reposition the wing isolation valve (i.e. open for engine start and close for
         takeoff). If a pneumatic supply SOV fails en route, do not plan flight through any
         area of forecast icing. CAUTION: T-1 (A/C #870025) should not plan sustained
         flight in forecast icing due to inoperative wing anti-icing.
      A10.5.1.8. Air Data Computer. At least three channels are required before a local area
      departure. The aircraft will be flown on a onetime flight to a station with repair
      capability with only two channels. (At least one channel of ADC1 must be operational).
      A10.5.1.9. APU. The APU will be operational for any mission departure into a field
      without alternate electric/air sources when engine shutdown is planned. Only one loop A
      or Loop B light/detector system may be inoperative for operation.
      A10.5.1.10. Cargo Mission Systems. The following door and ramp systems will be

        inoperative provided the transfer pump and auxiliary pumps are operable.
        A10.5.1.17.2. The transfer pump will be operational for local area departures. If the
        transfer pump fails en route, the mission may be continued to a facility with a repair
        capability as long as all system #2 and #3 pumps are operational.
        A10.5.1.17.3. All auxiliary pumps are required for a local area departure. En route,
        continue the mission with one inoperable auxiliary pump to a station with repair
        capability (all engine driven pumps/transfer pump for the affected system must be
        operational).

         A10.5.1.22.3. Stall Warning System. Both channels will be operational before a
         local area departure. En route, if one channel fails, continue the mission to a facility
         with a repair capability. Without a stall warning system, a one-time flight to a repair
         facility is authorized. A 3/4 flap landing with CG forward of 32% MAC is advised.
         A10.5.1.22.4. All proximity sensors affecting AFCS operation (landing gear, slats,
         doors/access hatches, etc.) will be operational for a local area departure and for all
         airdrop missions.
         A10.5.1.22.5. Fire/Smoke Detectors. Only one loop A or Loop B light/detector
         system for one engine may be inoperative. The following are the minimum smoke
         detectors required for flight: One AV; all 4 IRU; CAR 9, 10, 13, 14 plus two others
         in the cargo compartment.
         A10.5.1.22.6. Weather Radar. Radar is required for overseas deployments, night
         IMC flight, and when possible imbedded thunderstorms are forecast or a coverage
         greater than ―few‖ is expected for the planned route of flight.
         A10.5.1.22.7. Wheel Brakes. Ten operative brakes are required for all departures.
      A10.5.1.23. Oxygen Requirements. The minimum quantity of oxygen aboard the
      aircraft before takeoff must be sufficient to accomplish the planned flight to a suitable
      recovery base, should oxygen be required. Crewmembers occupying a crew station will
      have an oxygen mask connected and readily available for use from engine start until
      engine shutdown.
  A10.5.2. Aircraft T-1 (Tail # 870025) Restrictions.
      A10.5.2.1. Icing. T-1 is restricted from cruising in areas of known or forecast icing
      conditions due to inoperative wing anti-ice systems. Intermediate climbs and descents
      through light icing are approved.
      A10.5.2.2. Steep Approach/Austere Airfield Operations. For T-1, limit gross weight to
      428,000 pounds when crosswinds are greater than 20 knots due to 80 percent loads
      restriction.
  A10.5.3. Restrictions.
      A10.5.3.1. Simulated engine out approaches may be flown with an IP or flight examiner
      in one of the pilot seats, except for IP candidates under the supervision of a flight
      examiner during initial or re-qualification upgrade evaluation to IP. One throttle may be
      retarded to idle under the following conditions: airspeed not less than VMCA; positive
      rate of climb established during takeoff and climb out; and no lower than 500 ft AGL on
      approach to land. Rudder pedals are not active with the autopilot engaged.
      A10.5.3.2. Abnormal flap/slat configuration approaches will not be flown in the aircraft
      for training.
      A10.5.3.3. Approach to stall training will be performed no slower than stick shaker onset
      speed and with an instructor pilot in one of the seats.
      A10.5.3.4. Checklists. All checklists are initiated by the pilot flying; however,
      individual items may be accomplished prior to starting the respective checklist.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                   147

                             C-130 OPERATING PROCEDURES

A11.1. General Information. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives,
outlines procedures for operation of the C-130 aircraft under most circumstances. It applies to
AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of C-130 aircraft.
Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe,
effective mission accomplishment.
   A11.1.1. Crew Complement and Management
       A11.1.1.1. Non-Currency and Qualification Training. Non-current or unqualified
       crewmembers may perform in their primary crew position when supervised by an
       instructor of like specialty. For pilots, the instructor must occupy the other pilot seat.
       Crewmembers may instruct across like specialty lines for the purposes of scanner duties.
       (i.e. an instructor pilot qualified as a scanner may instruct a flight engineer during scanner
       upgrade and log instructor flight time on the AFTO Form 781)
       A11.1.1.2. Crew Complement. Minimum crew complement for the C-130 is IAW Table
       A11.1.
          A11.1.1.2.1. The minimum crew in AFMC C-130 aircraft will consist of the
          following: pilot; copilot; and flight engineer, or as directed in the applicable aircraft
          T.O. For C-130J aircraft, minimum crew is pilot, copilot, and loadmaster.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                  149

NOTES:
1. When required for mission accomplishment. Required for low level navigation
unless waived by OG/CC. For over-water missions, see FLIP AP.
2. An additional qualified aircrew member may perform scanner duties as
authorized and required by the mission.
3. Two loadmasters or one loadmaster and another qualified crewmember are
required if more than 40 passengers are scheduled to be carried. Both crewmembers
must remain in the cargo compartment, one forward and one aft for takeoffs and
landings. Qualified crewmembers may perform these duties on missions where 15
passengers or less are carried, and floor loaded cargo weight does not exceed 500
pounds.
4. Only one loadmaster is required for airdrop missions if:
a. Using only one paratroop door for personnel or door bundle (less than 100 lbs.)
drops.
b. High altitude (up to 10,000 feet MSL) non-static line personnel are dropped fro
m the ramp and door or, only one paratroop door is opened.
c. Dropping only simulated airdrop training bundles (SATBs).
d. A no-drop (dry pass) is planned.
e. Ground time is sufficient to permit on-load or offload by one loadmaster.
      A11.1.1.3. Pilot Qualification Training. Pilot mission qualification training may be
      conducted on missions with passengers onboard only if the individual in training is
      qualified (completed aircraft checkride with a valid AF Form 8) for the seat position
      occupied.
         A11.1.1.3.1. Maintenance and civilian employees under direct contract to the DoD,
         engaged in official direct mission support activities, are considered mission essential
         and may be onboard when touch-and-go or stop-and-go landings are performed.
A11.2. Mission Planning.
   A11.2.1. Minimum Altitudes. See Section A11.3.7. Minimum Altitudes, for guidance to
   compute all low Level related altitudes.
   A11.2.2. Departure Planning. Use AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217V1, and this instruction
   when planning an IFR departure.
      A11.2.2.1. IFR Departures.
150                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


         A11.2.2.1.1. Takeoff gross weight (GW) must not exceed that which would, in the
         event of an engine failure, lower the rate of climb to less than a 2.5 percent climb
         gradient (152 ft/nm).
         A11.2.2.1.2. Critical Field Length (CFL). Takeoff GW must never exceed that
         which would require CFL in excess of the runway available for a normal takeoff. If a
         DER crossing requirement exceeds 50 feet, use the correction chart in the
         performance manual for balanced critical field length for the first 50 feet, and add 50
         feet to balanced critical field length for every foot of altitude above 50 feet. Example:
         55 feet DER crossing requires the full correction on the balanced critical field length
         chart plus 250 additional feet of balanced critical field length. Required screen
         heights depend on the agency that wrote the standard instrument departure (SID).
         A11.2.2.1.3. If unable to determine the DER altitude required, use 35 feet for
         planning purposes.
         A11.2.2.1.4. If the requirements of AFI 11-202V3 paragraph 8.7.2.2. have been
         complied with (note: fuel dumping does not meet the requirements of immediate
         jettison to reduce weight) then use the following guidance for departure planning. If
         no minimum climb gradient is published, use 200 ft/NM with all engines operating
         and 152 ft/NM with one engine inoperative. If a higher climb gradient is published or
         required for radar vectors, use that climb gradient as the minimum with all engines
         operating and the required climb gradient minus 48 ft/NM as the minimum with one
         engine inoperative. If the departure airfield does not have an instrument approach,
         then an obstacle survey has not been completed. Therefore an IFR departure is not
         authorized. If the published IFR departure procedure does not include either routing
         or a minimum climb gradient (weather mins. only) then an IFR departure using those
         procedures is not authorized.
         A11.2.2.1.5. If the airport does not have an authorized IFR departure method, the
         weather at takeoff must permit a VFR climb to an IFR MEA, an appropriate IFR
         cruising altitude, or an altitude where radar vectors can be provided.
      A11.2.2.2. VFR Departures. VFR Departures will not be flown in lieu of proper obstacle
      clearance planning.
         A11.2.2.2.1. VFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and high
         terrain is avoided. Conduct VFR operations only when required for mission
         accomplishment.
         A11.2.2.2.2. The minimum climb gradient on four engines must ensure obstacles
         clearance along the planned departure route. Note: Use the climb-out flight path -4
         engines charts for this calculation.
         A11.2.2.2.3. Engine-out climb gradient capability ensures that in the event of an
         engine failure, the planned departure or emergency return route provides obstacle
         avoidance. Even when obstacles are not a factor, the aircraft must be capable of
         climbing at a rate of at least 300 feet per minute (or vertical velocity corresponding to
         152 feet per NM whichever is greater) on three engines at obstacle clearance speed.
         Use the takeoff gross weight limited by 3 engine climb performance charts for this
         calculation. The pilot shall ensure predeparture planning includes emergency return
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                 151


         routing (if applicable) and a gross weight reduction plan (fuel dumping and/or cargo
         jettison) if applicable.
  A11.2.3. Flight Data Calculations.
     A11.2.3.1. Computer Flight Plans. The authorized flight planning software for most C-
     130 variants is PFPS. If your aircraft is not supported by PFPS, use a contractor-
     developed equivalent or compute the flight plan manually.
     A11.2.3.2. Navigators will refer to Chapter 11 guidance in 11-2C130V3 for fuel
     planning.
     A11.2.3.3. A pilot crewmember, or additional flight engineer, will crosscheck the AF
     Form 4063, Mini C-130 TOLD Card, for accuracy by using the performance manual or
     approved tab data. As a minimum, the person checking the data will:
         A11.2.3.3.1. Verify gross weight independently from the AF Form 4063.
         A11.2.3.3.2. Review and compare the computed distances or ground roll with the
         actual conditions and runway available.
         A11.2.3.3.3. Crosscheck minimum control, takeoff, and landing speeds.
     A11.2.3.4. A C-130J pilot will crosscheck the CNI-MU TOLD information for accuracy
     using the performance manual or approved tab data. As a minimum the person checking
     the data will:
         A11.2.3.4.1. Verify gross weight independently from the entered value.
         A11.2.3.4.2. Verify the entered parameters and configurations.
         A11.2.3.4.3. Verify Minimum Control, Rotate, and Landing speeds.
         A11.2.3.4.4. Verify the correct speeds have been entered into the V SPEEDS page.
         A11.2.3.4.5. Review and compare the computed distances or ground roll with the
         actual conditions and runway available.
     A11.2.3.5. The guidance for completing a takeoff found in TO 1C-130H-1-1 Change 6
     Minimum Control Speeds requires the pilot to maintain continuous input into the
     nosewheel steering until Vrot or VMCG. This guidance is in conflict with the published
     guidance found in the C-130 Dash-1. The guidance published in the C-130 Dash-1,
     Section 2 will continue to apply with respect to the use of nosewheel steering during
     normal takeoffs. The guidance published in the C-130 Dash-1, Section 3, Directional
     Control Problems will continue to apply with respect to the use of nosewheel steering for
     all cases. Over controlling through the use of nose wheel steering could result in a pilot
     induced directional control problem.
  A11.2.4. Runway and Taxiway Minimums. Minimum dimensions for aircraft operations are
  shown in Table A11.2.

Note 1: The OG/CC may authorize the use of tactical takeoff criteria for
both assault and non-assault qualified crews. Comply with performance
manual calculation procedures. Document approval on the flight
authorization.
   A11.2.5. Operations over Runway cables.
      A11.2.5.1. Do not land on (touchdown on) approach end arresting cables (does not
      include recessed cables). If the aircraft lands before the cable, contact the tower to have
      the cable inspected.
      A11.2.5.2. Do not takeoff or land over an approach end cable that has been reported as
      slack, loose, or improperly rigged by NOTAM, automated terminal information service
      (ATIS) or ATC.
      A11.2.5.3. Operations are authorized on runways where BAK-12 systems are installed,
      with a minimum of a six-point cable tie-down system, without regard to the Dash-One
      Restriction. The aircraft must cross the cable within the lateral dimension of the tie down
      system to avoid damage. When operating from runways equipped with other types of
      systems, or if it is unknown if the BAK-12 system includes six point tie-downs, aircrews
      should recognize the increased risk of damage to the aircraft.
   A11.2.6. LZ Markings. Refer to AFI 13-217. The markings must be firmly established
   during mission planning and included in the aircrew briefing.
   A11.2.7. Minimum Runway Condition Report (RCR). Refer to paragraph 2.15 and 3.2.5.
   When no RCR is available, refer to the flight manual for standard ICAO conversions based
   on general runway condition.
   A11.2.8. Crash Fire Rescue (CFR). Up to four takeoffs and landings within 14 consecutive
   days may be accomplished at airfields without appropriate CFR readily available.
   A11.2.9. Reduced Power Operations. Reduced power operations are intended to prolong
   engine service life.
      A11.2.9.1. During proficiency flights, TIT will not be less than 900 degrees C for
      takeoff, not to exceed 19,600 in-lbs of torque.
      A11.2.9.2. Reduce power for formation takeoffs to a torque corresponding to a TIT of no
      less than 970 degrees C for takeoff and climb. Higher power settings may be used, if
      needed, and will be briefed by the formation commander.
      A11.2.9.3. Climb power to cruise altitude will be 970 degrees C TIT for -15 engines and
      932 degrees C TIT for -7 engines, unless mission requirements dictate otherwise, not to
      exceed 19,600 in-lbs of torque.
      A11.2.9.4. Use maximum power for max effort takeoffs (actual or simulated), not to
      exceed 19,600 in-lbs of torque.
A11.3. Common Mission Guidance. Note: Aircrew attached to AFSOC or AFSOC gained
flying organizations will comply with AFSOC published guidance.
154                                 AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


  A11.3.1. Air Refueling. The C-130 can fulfill roles as a tanker during Helicopter Air
  Refueling (HAR) or Tiltrotor Air Refueling (TAR). Special Mission C-130 variants may
  also be capable or Air-to-Air Refueling (AAR) as a receiver. Contact AFMC/A3V for
  guidance when/if these mission elements are required. N/A for AFMC aircrew attached to
  AFSOC or AFSOC gained flying organizations.
  A11.3.2. Formation. All tactical and special formation procedures will be flown in
  accordance with AFI 11-2C-130V3 or AFI 11-2C-130JV3. For the most current guidance,
  download that instruction from the AF publications web site.
      A11.3.2.1. The most probable formation flown in AFMC is visual fluid trail. Spacing
      will be as briefed/required but will be flown to assure nose/tail and wing tip separation.
  A11.3.3. NVG Operations. NVGs are approved for use during takeoffs and landings for
  properly qualified aircrew.
      A11.3.3.1. NVG Altitudes. Aircrew may use NVGs to maintain situational awareness
      and to visually clear at any altitude. NVG Low Level operations flown by qualified
      aircrew may be conducted at 300 ft contours for level/rolling terrain and 500 ft contours
      in mountainous terrain.
  A11.3.4. Airdrop Procedures. AFMC aircrew will reference AFI 11-2C-130V3 and/or AFI
  11-2MC-130V3 for additional guidance for the various airdrop operations capable on the C-
  130. AFMC aircrew attached to AFSOC or AFSOC gained flying organizations will comply
  with AFI 11-2MC-130V3.
      A11.3.4.1. Specialized airdrop equipment (test articles, etc) will be operated in
      accordance with test plans and/or locally approved procedures.
  A11.3.5. Low Level Navigation. The low level environment is defined in Chapter 3, Para
  A3.5.1. Low Level environment. C-130 low level operations are not held to LASDT
  constraints. Instead, if the crew member has received an AF Form 8 documented low level
  evaluation from a formal school qualification program, that individual is low level qualified
  to the altitudes outlined in this attachment. For all others, gain low level qualification by
  completing the AFMC published low level training plan. Except for navigation profiles
  flown as part of approved test plans or in conjunction with FCF profiles, do not operate the
  aircraft lower than the altitudes shown below.
  A11.3.6. Minimum Altitudes.
      A11.3.6.1. Day VMC Enroute. Plan a minimum of 500 feet AGL (300 AGL on
      approved routes) modified contour altitude above the terrain using visual references and
      radar altimeter. Aircrews may fly lower to perform system checks (OCF/FCF/Test etc.).
      However limit time below 300 feet to the minimum required for system checks.
      A11.3.6.2. Night VMC Enroute. Plan enroute legs at an indicated altitude of 500 feet
      above the highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstacle, terrain feature, or spot
      elevation), or 400 feet plus one chart contour interval above the highest depicted terrain
      contour, whichever is highest, within 5 NMs of route centerline to include the aircraft
      turn radius over each turn point. If the altitude for the next leg is higher than the current
      leg altitude, climb will be completed prior to the turn point. If the altitude for the next leg
      is lower than the current leg, do not initiate descent until over the turn point. Legs may
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                    155


     be divided into segments for night altitude computations, depending on terrain
     differential or threats in order to allow flight closer to the ground. Once the obstacle or
     terrain feature is visually identified and the aircraft is confirmed well clear, the crew may
     descend to the next segmented altitude, if lower. NOTE: Planning a route on a JOG
     chart, if available, significantly reduces night enroute altitudes. If the route has been
     planned on a JOG and night altitudes are verified, the route may be flown with the lower
     altitudes when flying with reference to a tactical pilotage chart (TPC).
     A11.3.6.3. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA). MSA is an initial VFR altitude that provides
     additional terrain clearance while the aircrew analyzes situations that require interruption
     of low-level operations (route disorientation and equipment malfunctions or when either
     pilot must leave the seat during low-level operations, etc. Climb to the 500 set clearance
     plane if a pilot must leave the seat during TF operations.). An MSA will be computed for
     each leg, route segment, or entire low-level route. Compute MSA the same as night
     altitudes above.
     A11.3.6.4. Minimum IFR Enroute Altitude. Compute minimum IFR enroute altitude by
     adding 1,000 feet (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain) above the highest obstruction to
     flight (man-made obstruction, terrain feature, or spot elevation) within 5 NMs of route
     centerline. Round this altitude to the next 100-foot increment.
        A11.3.6.4.1. Minimum altitudes for IFR operations within published Military
        Training Routes (MTRs) in US sovereign airspace will be the computed leg MSAs
        unless a higher altitude is required by FLIP AP/1B.
     A11.3.6.5. Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA). ESA is designed to provide positive IMC
     terrain clearance during emergency situations that require leaving the low-level structure.
     Several ESAs may be computed for route segments transiting significant terrain
     differentials, or a single ESA may be computed for the entire low-level route. To
     compute ESA, add 1,000 feet (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain) to the elevation of the
     highest obstruction to flight within 22 NMs either side of the planned route centerline.
        A11.3.6.5.1. Climbing to the ESA may put the aircraft in a controlled (i.e., IFR)
        altitude structure requiring coordination with air traffic control agencies.
     A11.3.6.6. Pressure altimeters are calibrated to indicate true altitudes under international
     standard atmospheric (ISA) conditions. Any deviation from these standard conditions
     will result in erroneous readings on the altimeter. This error becomes important when
     considering obstacle clearances in temperatures lower than standard since the aircraft's
     altitude is below the figure indicated by the altimeter. Refer to the flight information
     handbook to determine correction.
  A11.3.7. Chase Operations. C-130 aircrew are not normally required to maintain chase
  qualification.
     A11.3.7.1. If the C-130 is required to fly as a test mission chase, the following
     restrictions apply:
        A11.3.7.1.1. The C-130 acts as chase for another C-130.
            A11.3.7.1.1.1. The aircrew will be C-130 visual formation qualified.
            A11.3.7.1.1.2. All formation procedures will be IAW this Instruction. Formation
 156                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


              spacing will be no closer than 200ft.
          A11.3.7.1.2. If the C-130 aircrew is required to chase any other aircraft, Chase
          qualification training will be completed IAW 2FT Vol 1 and the Procedures in Chap 3
          of this Instruction will be complied with.
              A11.3.7.1.2.1. Chase spacing will be no closer than 200ft.
       A11.3.7.2. If a specific test mission requires an aircraft to chase the C-130, the following
       restrictions apply:
          A11.3.7.2.1. Prior to each chase sortie, supervisory personnel will ensure the C-130
          PIC and chase pilots are briefed on the mission content, restrictions, and
          responsibilities.
          A11.3.7.2.2. The C-130 and chase aircraft must maintain radio contact throughout
          the chase operation.
          A11.3.7.2.3. It is unsafe to fly in close vertical proximity to another aircraft due to
          the interrelated aerodynamic effects. Never fly directly over or under another aircraft.
          The chase position is will be defined I the test plan, but will be no closer than 200ft.
          A11.3.7.2.4. The normal chase position will be dictated by the test plan
          requirements.
          A11.3.7.2.5. The C-130 aircraft must inform the chase aircraft and receive
          acknowledgment prior to initiating turns, climbs and descents, airspeed changes, or
          configuration changes (e.g. flaps, gear, etc.).
   A11.3.8. Test Pilot School (TPS) Curriculum. Any curriculum profile will be flown IAW
   the procedures and limitations of the applicable C-130 and IAW all guidance in this
   Instruction. An IP will be in the seat for all TPS curriculum events.
A11.4. Instrument Procedures.
   A11.4.1. Instrument Approach Procedures.
       A11.4.1.1. The C-130 is normally a category C aircraft. If approach speeds exceed 140
       knots, the minimums for category D will be used.
       A11.4.1.2. Circling Approach. If the circling minimums are not published by category,
       ensure the HAA and visibility are not less than the following:
          A11.4.1.2.1. Category C - 500 feet – 1 ½ miles.
          A11.4.1.2.2. Category D - 600 feet - 2 miles.
       A11.4.1.3. If full flight instrumentation is not available and operational, base DH or
       MDA on a minimum HAT or HAA of 300 feet and RVR 40, or visibility ¾ mile if RVR
       is not available. Full flight instrumentation for all approaches includes barometric
       altimeters, airspeed indicators, vertical velocity indicators, heading indicators, and
       attitude indicators, in the pilot and copilot positions. For an ILS/MLS full flight
       instrumentation also includes dual flight displays. One flight director for the pilot flying
       the approach, plus ADI repeat (C-130J: same sources for the Primary Flight Display) for
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                 157


     the pilot monitoring the approach satisfies this requirement.          MC-130H standby
     instruments do not satisfy this requirement.
     A11.4.1.4. For precision radar approaches, visibility will be no lower than RVR 24 or ½
     mile if RVR is not available. DH will be based on an HAT of no less than 200 feet.
     A11.4.1.5. Fly a precision approach, if available, at night and during marginal weather.
     If PAR, MLS, or ILS is not available, fly any available approved instrument approach.
     On training and evaluation flights, or flights at familiar airfields, pilots may fly
     nonprecision approaches or VFR patterns to accomplish required training or evaluation
     requirements.
  A11.4.2. Advisory Calls. C-130 crews will use the guidance below versus that listed in AFI
  11-2FTV3 Chap 4. The pilot flying will periodically announce intentions during departure,
  arrivals, approaches, and when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures.
  Mandatory advisory calls are: (The pilot not flying the aircraft will make these calls except
  those designated for any crewmember).
     A11.4.2.1. Takeoff. State "GO" at refusal speed or takeoff speed, whichever is lower. If
     refusal speed is lower than takeoff speed, state ―‖Rotate‖ at takeoff speed. Any
     crewmember noting a safety of flight malfunction before hearing ―GO‖ will state
     ―REJECT‖ and a brief description of the malfunction.
     A11.4.2.2. Takeoff Aborts and Landings: The Flight Engineer (non-flying pilot for C-
     130J) will state which throttles / power levers may be brought into reverse: ―All 4‖;
     ―Inboards‖, or ―Outboards‖ as appropriate.
     A11.4.2.3. Altitude calls:
         A11.4.2.3.1. 1000 feet above initial approach fix (IAF) (or holding) altitude.
         A11.4.2.3.2. Transition altitude/level.
         A11.4.2.3.3. 1000 feet above/below assigned altitude.
     A11.4.2.4. Approaches:
         A11.4.2.4.1. Call 100 feet above procedure turn, final approach fix (FAF), MDA, or
         DH altitude.
         A11.4.2.4.2. Non-precision approaches.
             A11.4.2.4.2.1. ―Minimums‖ when reaching MDA.
             A11.4.2.4.2.2. ―Runway in sight.‖ Call when sufficient visual reference with the
             runway environment is established and the aircraft is in a safe position to land.
             Do not call too soon when obstructions to vision, such as fog, haze, low stratus
             clouds, etc., are present.
             A11.4.2.4.2.3. ―Go-around.‖ Call at missed approach point when visual
             reference with the runway environment is insufficient to continue the approach, or
             if the aircraft is not in a position for a safe landing.
         A11.4.2.4.3. Precision approaches.
             A11.4.2.4.3.1. ―Continue.‖ Call at DH if only the approach lighting system is in
 158                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


              sight and a determination cannot yet be made that the aircraft is in a position for a
              safe landing. If an approach is continued below DH based on seeing the approach
              lights only (an approach to visibility minimums), ―Go-around‖ must be called by
              100 feet if a determination to land cannot be made.
              A11.4.2.4.3.2. ―Land.‖ Call at DH if runway environment is in sight and the
              aircraft is in a position for a normal landing.
              A11.4.2.4.3.3. ―Go-around.‖ Call at DH or later if the runway environment is not
              in sight or if the aircraft is not in a position for a safe landing. If an approach is
              continued below DH based on seeing the approach lights only (an approach to
              visibility minimums), ―Go-around‖ must be called by 100 feet if a determination
              to land cannot be made.
       A11.4.2.5. Deviations.
          A11.4.2.5.1. The pilot not flying the aircraft will tell the other pilot when heading or
          airspeed deviations are observed or altitude is more than 100 feet from desired, and
          no attempt is being made to correct the deviation.
          A11.4.2.5.2. Any crewmember seeing a variation of 200 feet altitude, a deviation of
          ±10 knots or a potential terrain obstruction problem will immediately notify the pilot.
          Deviations from prescribed procedures for the approach being flown will also be
          announced.
A11.5. Operating Procedures and Restrictions.
   A11.5.1. Flight Duty Period (FDP). Observe restrictions and guidance of AFI 11-202 Vol. 3
   and this instruction and the following: Limit crew day to 12 hours with an inoperative

         before engine start until engine shutdown.
         A11.5.9.1.3. Aircrews required to fly un-pressurized missions from18,000 feet to FL
         249 will pre-breathe 100 percent oxygen for thirty minutes. Crews are restricted to
         one sortie per 24 hour period and a maximum of 2 hours exposure per sortie. For any
         flight above FL 249, refer to lead command guidance.
         A11.5.9.1.4. Life preserver units (LPUs). The loadmaster/scanner will place an LPU
         within easy reach of each seated passenger and aircrew member for over-water
         flights. Crewmembers will fit and adjust LPUs for over-water flights and will wear
         them on over-water missions below 2000 feet. (LPUs need not be worn for takeoffs,
         landings, or approaches).
  A11.5.10. Communications Policy.
      A11.5.10.1. Sterile Cockpit. Limit conversation to that essential for crew coordination
      and mission accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, approach, landing, and any flight below
      10,000 feet MSL (except cruise).

      critical phases of flight. All C-130J crewmembers will monitor VOX in addition to
      Interphone during critical phases of flight. Crewmembers will advise the aircraft
      commander prior to checking off interphone.
      A11.5.10.3. Command Radios:
         A11.5.10.3.1. The pilot not flying the aircraft normally makes all air traffic control
         (ATC) radio calls.
         A11.5.10.3.2. The pilot operating the radios will announce which radio is primary,
         and advise the crew when the primary radio changes.
         A11.5.10.3.3. One pilot will record and acknowledge all ATC clearances. Another
         crewmember should monitor the read back and ensure compliance.
         A11.5.10.3.4. Both pilots will monitor UHF guard (or VHF guard when appropriate)
         regardless of primary radio.
  A11.5.11. Reverse Taxi.
      A11.5.11.1. The pilot will coordinate reverse taxi directions and signals to be used with
      the scanner or loadmaster.
      A11.5.11.2. Secure all cargo and ensure all passengers are seated.

     instructions on turns, distance remaining, conditions of the maneuvering area, and
     stopping point.
  A11.5.12. Engine Running On-load and Offload (ERO). Use ERO procedures when
  necessary to expedite aircraft movement or permit the exchange of crewmembers. ERO
  procedures may be used for any mix of personnel or cargo. Material handling equipment
  should be used if palletized cargo is to be on-loaded or offloaded. Aircraft commanders must
  assess prevailing weather, lighting and parking location to ensure safe operations.
  WARNING: Do not on-load or offload through the crew entrance door and cargo ramp and
  door at the same time. Paratroop doors will not normally be used. NOTE: At their
  discretion, aircraft commanders may ERO any category of passenger. The number of
  passengers and amount of baggage to be on-loaded or offloaded should be taken into
  consideration.
     A11.5.12.1. General Procedures.
         A11.5.12.1.1. Aircraft commanders will brief crewmembers on the intended ERO
         operation.

         monitor brakes, interphone, and radio.
         A11.5.12.1.3. Use wing leading edge and taxi lights to enhance safety at night as the
         situation dictates.
         A11.5.12.1.4. Station another crewmember on interphone or public address (PA) in
         the cargo compartment as safety observer. Safety observers will remain forward of
         all cargo.
         A11.5.12.1.5. C-130 J crews should consider using HOTEL mode for the propellers.
         If this is utilized, select Emergency Brakes prior to selecting HOTEL mode on
         engines 1 and 2. While down-sped, the hydraulic pumps are also turning at 29% and
         may not deliver enough pressure to maintain normal brakes under certain
         circumstances.
     A11.5.12.2. Offload Preparation/Procedures. Aerial delivery support (ADS) arms will
     remain connected in flight. Prior to landing, the loadmaster will brief all personnel in the
     cargo compartment regarding their locations, duties, and responsibilities during the ERO.
         A11.5.12.2.1. One tie-down device forward and aft will remain connected to vehicles
         until the aircraft is parked.
         A11.5.12.2.2. Vehicles and passengers will proceed directly aft of the aircraft at least
         50 feet before turning and/or 300 feet before stopping.
     A11.5.12.3. Personnel on/offload through the aft cargo door and ramp.
         A11.5.12.3.1. Passengers will be escorted by a crewmember when enplaning or
         deplaning through the aft door and ramp.
         A11.5.12.3.2. Auxiliary ground loading ramps should be used.
         A11.5.12.3.3. Unless cargo size and location dictate otherwise, deplane passengers
         before cargo, and enplane after cargo.
162                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


      A11.5.12.4. Personnel on-load and offload through the crew entrance door:
         A11.5.12.4.1. Station a crewmember on interphone with cord held taut at
         approximately 20 feet at an angle of 45 degrees from the aircraft axis.
         A11.5.12.4.2. Brief deplaning personnel to secure loose articles and remain forward
         of the interphone cord.
         A11.5.12.4.3. No enplaning personnel should approach the airplane until the
         crewmember is in place.
  A11.5.13. Takeoff and Landing Policy. An aircraft commander or higher (IP/EP) will
  occupy either the left or right seat during all takeoffs, landings, and critical phases of flight.
  The designated PIC (A-Code) is not required to occupy a primary position, but still retains
  overall authority for the conduct of the mission. Pilots (MP/FP) or Instructor pilots may
  takeoff or land from either seat. Copilots (MC) will only takeoff or land from the right seat
  unless in upgrade status to MP/FP and under the direct supervision of an IP.
      A11.5.13.1. An instructor qualified pilot or aircraft commander will make all takeoffs
      and landings during:
         A11.5.13.1.1. Aircraft emergencies.
         A11.5.13.1.2. Tactical/Assault or substandard airfield operations. EXCEPTION:
         Instructors providing upgrade training, receiving an evaluation, gaining currency, or
         proficiency.
         A11.5.13.1.3. Situations when in the opinion of the aircraft commander, marginal
         conditions exist.
  A11.5.14. Simulated Emergency Procedures.
      A11.5.14.1. Emergency procedures which require simulating an engine(s) shutdown, or
      placing switches in other than their normal positions, or an abnormal configuration, only
      during training, evaluation, or currency flights when an instructor or flight examiner is in
      one of the pilot seats. Instructor pilot candidates who occupy a pilot seat and are under
      the supervision of a flight examiner pilot (not in a pilot seat) may practice simulated
      emergency procedures during initial or re-qualification upgrade evaluations. Preface all
      simulated emergencies with the word ―simulated‖ and terminate simulated emergencies
      when an actual emergency arises.
      A11.5.14.2. When conducting simulated engine(s) out training, the flight engineer will
      post actual charted minimum control speed on the TOLD card. Comply with Dash -1
      guidance for Simulated Engine Failure adjustments to Vmca. (Chap 3). During simulated
      3-engine takeoff operations, takeoff speed will be adjusted for minimum control speed.
      The instructor pilot should strive to maintain zero torque on the simulated shutdown
      engine(s). More detailed information is contained in chapter three of the applicable -1.
      C-130J pilots will reference the minimum control speeds through Tab data or the CNI.
      Turns unto the simulated inoperative engine(s) should be minimized when possible.
  A11.5.15. Prohibited In-flight Maneuvers. The following maneuvers will not be practiced or
  demonstrated in-flight:
      A11.5.15.1. Rudder force reversals (fin stalls).
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                     163

       A11.5.15.3. Simulated runaway trim malfunctions.
       A11.5.15.4. Simulated hydraulic system loss by turning engine driven hydraulic pumps
       off.
   A11.5.16. Flight Maneuvers. The maneuvers listed in Table A11.3. are authorized for
   qualification and continuation training (or formal upgrade training where indicated). Certain
   maneuvers will only be performed during formal training under direct IP supervision. They
   are applicable to all C-130 aircraft. Aircraft commanders will ensure their crews are advised
   of the maneuvers being flown. The intent is to eliminate confusion or concern over unusual
   procedures that might not be anticipated. Good communication is a matter of policy and
   common sense.

      A11.5.17.6. -(C-130J) Normally set the RADALT to 250 for non-precision approaches
      and 300 for circling approaches.
  A11.5.18. Chaff and Flare Operations. Conduct the following procedures after the live
  firing of chaff and flares:
      A11.5.18.1. After landing, taxi to the de-arm area or another suitable safe location to
      check for hung ordnance.
      A11.5.18.2. The loadmaster or another qualified crewmember will deplane the aircraft
      and check all flare dispensers for hung ordnance. NOTE: The mid-fuselage dispensers
      can be visually checked by opening the paratroop doors. (Eye protection is required prior
      to opening the paratroop door.) The forward dispensers must be checked by deplaning a
      crewmember.
         A11.5.18.2.1. ALE-40/47 or flare squibs that fail to fire are not considered hung
         ordnance.
      A11.5.18.3. If hung ordnance is found, identified by a protruding or partially ejected
      flare cartridge, the aircraft will remain in a de-arm area until Explosive Ordnance
      Disposal (EOD) personnel meet the aircraft. The aircraft must remain in the designated
      safe area until EOD personnel can clear all hung ordnance.
      A11.5.18.4. If hung ordnance is not found, the aircraft can proceed to the parking
      location.
  A11.5.19. Descent. Prior to descent into unfamiliar areas, appropriate terrain charts
  (Operational Navigation Chart (ONC), Sectional Aeronautical Chart, Tactical Pilotage Chart
  (TPC), or Joint Operations Graphic (JOG)) should be reviewed to increase aircrew situational
  awareness of obstructions. The C-130J Global Digital Map with the appropriate charts
  loaded meets this requirement. Primary crewmembers will not be involved in duties other
  than aircraft operations, descent and approach monitoring, and required checklist items from
  the initial descent point to landing.
  A11.5.20. Touch and Go Landings. Touch and go landings can only be performed by
  certified individuals. Refer to AFI 11-2FT Vol. 1, for specific certification requirements.
  Include type of touch and go as part of the briefing, (i.e., ground-idle or flight-idle). Use 900
  TIT minimum during touch and go‘s. Any MP/FP/CP may complete flight idle touch and go
  landings. An IP is required to be in the seat for ground idle touch and go landings.
  A11.5.21. Windmill Taxi Starts, Buddy Starts, and 3-Engine Takeoffs.
      A11.5.21.1. Windmill taxi and buddy starts, dictated by operational requirements, may
      be authorized by the OG/CC or equivalent (System Program Director O-6 at units
      without an OG) to meet specific mission requirements. (N/A for C-130J).
         A11.5.21.1.1. Windmill taxi starts, for training, may be accomplished during pilot
         proficiency training. Comply with all T.O. –1 restrictions and those contained in this
         instruction.
      A11.5.21.2. Actual 3-Engine takeoffs require specific approval from HQ AFMC/A3.
  A11.5.22. Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) / Ground Collision Avoidance
  System (GCAS)
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                   167


     A11.5.22.1. For operations in day VMC conditions, with terrain and obstacles clearly in
     sight, the PF will call runway and/or terrain in sight, state intentions and visually clear
     terrain.
     A11.5.22.2. For operations at night or in IMC, if an aural warning is heard, immediately
     and simultaneously rotate the aircraft to establish a climb while rolling wings level, and
     add maximum power until the warning has ceased and adequate terrain clearance is
     verified. WARNING: Do not delay pull-up for diagnosis of the low altitude warning.
     Failure to roll wings level during the maneuver described above will decrease stall
     margin at heavy aircraft gross weights.
     A11.5.22.3. Ensure the mode of the GPWS/GCAS is commensurate with the aircraft‘s
     phase of flight.
  A11.5.23. Traffic Advisory and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). Operate the TCAS
  with sensitivity set to Traffic Advisory/Resolution Advisory (TA/RA) to the maximum
  extent possible. ATC procedures and the ―see and avoid concept‖ will continue to be the
  primary means of ensuring aircraft separation. Pilots shall not deviate from an assigned ATC
  clearance based solely on TA information. Attempt to attain visual contact and maintain safe
  separation. However, if visual separation with the intruding traffic cannot be assured, it is
  imperative to follow resolution advisories (RA) to obtain aircraft separation computed by
  TCAS. Failure to follow the computed RA may increase the probability of a midair
  collision. Do not exceed aircraft structural limits or safe flight speed in order to follow the
  RA. Always attempt to visually clear the airspace before maneuvering your airplane in
  response to a TCAS advisory. Advise ATC as soon as practical when a deviation becomes
  necessary due to a TCAS resolution advisory.
  A11.5.24. Systems Operations Guidelines
     A11.5.24.1. Objectives
         A11.5.24.1.1. A fully mission capable aircraft is the ultimate objective of the
         logistics effort. The final responsibility regarding equipment required for a mission
         rests with the aircraft commander. If one aircraft commander accepts an aircraft to
         operate a mission or mission segment without an item or system, this acceptance does
         not commit that aircraft commander, or a different aircraft commander, to subsequent
         operations with the same item or system inoperative. When the aircraft commander
         considers an item essential, designate the component mission essential (ME) on the
         AFTO Form 781, and the item will be repaired or replaced prior to departure.
         A11.5.24.1.2. Engine performance, aircraft attitude, vertical velocity indications,
         altitude, airspeed, and heading instruments should be operative in both pilot positions.
         For instruments with both analog and digital displays, as a minimum the analog
         portion must be operational. (Exception: the radar altimeter may have either analog or
         digital readouts operational.)
     A11.5.24.2. Policy. Command operating guidelines list the equipment and systems
     normally considered essential for routine operations. This list is not inclusive of all
     equipment or systems essential to airworthiness. The aircraft commander is the
     approving authority for operations with degraded equipment and needs no further
     approval. This section provides guidance on how to operate with inoperative/degraded
168                                 AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


      equipment. The Minimum Equipment List (MEL) shall not direct deviation from the
      aircraft flight manual limitations, emergency procedures or USAF/AFMC directives. The
      diversity of C-130 variants flown by this command complicates the task of balancing
      operational reliability with safe mission completion. C-130 Category specific guidance
      will be defined in the tables below. If there is no category listed, the restriction applies to
      all applicable versions. C-130J: Unless otherwise noted, when the item is duplicated on
      a soft panel (switch or indication), the number required may be satisfied by either
      location. For partial or complete hard panel failures, aircrews may revert to soft panel
      operations. Normally, if a soft panel is selected due to hard panel failure, it should be
      used for the remainder of the flight.
         A11.5.24.2.1. If, after exploring all options, the aircraft commander determines that a
         safe flight is possible with an item listed below inoperative (beyond the scope listed
         here) a waiver shall be requested through channels to AFMC/A3V. Phone or e-mail
         methods are appropriate. Any inoperative item not covered in this publication shall
         be assessed by the aircraft commander and crew. If a safe flight can be
         accomplished, no further action is necessary. Exceptions for degraded operations is
         not intended for continued operations over an indefinite period with
         systems/subsystems inoperative.
      A11.5.24.3. Navigation Systems.
         A11.5.24.3.1. For flights in Minimum Navigation Performance Specifications
         (MNPS) airspace in the North Atlantic region or the Composite Hawaii/mainland US
         Route System, the following fully operable navigation systems are considered the
         minimum necessary to permit compliance.
             A11.5.24.3.1.1. SCNS aircraft. Fully functional SCNS, to include the navigator‘s
             IDCU and either the pilot or copilot IDCU.
             A11.5.24.3.1.2. Non-SCNS aircraft. Two independent sources of drift and
             ground speed, i.e. doppler/DVS and INS, doppler/DVS and GPS, INS and GPS,
             or dual INS.
         A11.5.24.3.2. Sextant and sextant mount. (Not required on aircraft with integrated
         GPS or dual INS).
         A11.5.24.3.3. Compass systems. When two systems are installed, both should be
         operational. If one system fails, refer to the flight manual to determine what other
         equipment is affected. One compass and one aligned inertial system is acceptable.
         The C-130 standby compass is not considered a separate source for the purposes of
         this paragraph.
         A11.5.24.3.4. For flights on all other Category I routes, the aircraft commander
         determines the minimum navigational capability required to safely accomplish the
         mission.
         A11.5.24.3.5. Equipment listed in FLIP AP/2 for permitting compliance with MNPS
         is mandatory. Loss of any component before track entry requires a return to station
         with maintenance capability or re-file via specified routes.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                               169

NOTE: The primary concern with inoperative fuel boost pumps or quantity indicators is fuel balance
and wing loading. Degraded operation is permissible, however, flight crews must consider potentially
trapped fuel and decreased range should further degradation occur.

Notes
1. A Quick don oxygen mask with attached goggles is the preferred smoke and fume protection
for aircrew personnel. Quick don masks with attached goggles will be available for each primary
crew member aboard plus two extra mask/goggle sets located at FS 245 and 617 for the purpose
of firefighting. Fire Fighter‘s Smoke masks may be used in lieu of Quick don masks/goggles at
FS 245 and 617 if necessary. These requirements are in addition to the crew member‘s personal
helmet and oxygen mask. Personal helmets/oxygen masks may be substituted for personal Quick
don mask/goggles sets as mission directives require. Firefighting capability must be maintained
through the use of Quick don mask/goggles and/or firefighters smoke masks. Total number of
mask/goggle combinations must equal the primary crew positions for the mission to be
planned/flown. Use and positioning of aircrew oxygen helmets/masks will be IAW published
guidance.
2. Number may be reduced to zero if two quick don oxygen masks with attached goggles are
used instead of smoke masks and positioned with walk around O2 bottles in the cargo
compartment. IAW AFI 11-301 Vol 2 Table 4. Note 1, Smoke masks will not be placed on the
flight deck.
3. One harness must be installed on the flight deck for the Flight Engineer. If parachutes are not
used, a second restraint harness is required for FCF missions when doors are to be opened. A

second harness may be desired for LM/Scanner use during door operations for Smoke/Fume
Elimination. C-130J: One harness must be installed on the flight deck and a second harness will
be prepositioned in the cargo compartment. Two harnesses will ensure that the Loadmaster will
have a harness available for any door open warning.
4. Tie down devices and chains are not required when MLG Emergency Tie-Down Devices are
carried aboard the aircraft. However, chains and devices provide an increased margin of safety
in the event of device failure and these numbers are recommended.

                            C-135 OPERATING PROCEDURES

A12.1. General Information.
   A12.1.1. Scope. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives, outlines
   procedures for operation of the C-135 aircraft under most circumstances. It applies to AFMC
   aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of all C-135 series aircraft.
   Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance
   safe, effective mission accomplishment.
A12.2. Mission Planning.
   A12.2.1. Aircrew Qualification. Primary crewmembers or those occupying a primary
   position during flight must be basic-qualified or in training for qualification for that crew
   position. If non-current, or in training for a particular event, the crewmember must be under
   the supervision of an instructor while accomplishing that event (direct supervision for critical
   phases of flight). Exceptions are IAW with AFI 11-401/AFMC S1.
      A12.2.1.1. Pilots:
          A12.2.1.1.1. Missions with passengers. Only a pilot that is qualified and current will
          occupy a pilot‘s seat with passengers onboard the aircraft. One of the following
          conditions must be met:
              A12.2.1.1.1.1. Two qualified and current pilots must be at the controls. Or,
              A12.2.1.1.1.2. A qualified pilot regaining currency, a basic-qualified receiving
              difference, conversion, or mission training; and an IP providing direct supervision
              must be at the controls.
      A12.2.1.2. Other crewmembers: Non-current or unqualified navigators, flight engineers,
      communications systems operators, flight attendants, boom operators or avionics flight
      technicians may perform in their primary crew position on any mission when supervised
      by a qualified instructor of like specialty.
   A12.2.2. Crew Complement. Minimum aircrew complement for basic and augmented FDP
   will be commensurate with the applicable T.O. 1C-135X(X)X-1 Flight Manual, applicable
   Partial/Modification Flight Manual and Table A12.1.

Note 1: When required by basic/partial/modification
flight manual or as mandated by Unit CC for mission
accomplishment.
Note 2: One Navigator, flight engineer, and
communications system operator satisfies augmented
crew member requirements for Speckled Trout
executive airlift missions.
Note 3: One boom operator satisfies augmented
crewmember requirements during non-tanker
executive airlift missions.
Note 4: Two FAs will be the basic crew complement
for all Speckled Trout executive airlift missions. No
FAs are required on local missions with 10 or fewer
passengers, provided another crew member trained in
passenger handling is aboard and designated as
passenger monitor. FAs are not required in the
absence of passengers.

       A12.2.2.1. The unit commander will designate additional crewmembers if the mission
       complexity or priority dictates, or to meet navigator or other crew position
       currency/training requirements.
       A12.2.2.2. Augmented crews are required when a mission cannot be safely completed
       within a basic flight duty period. Augmentees must be basic-qualified in accordance with
       AFI 11-2FTV1, Flight Test Aircrew Training.             In those situations requiring
       augmentation, the crew must be augmented from the start of the duty period. If
       augmentees are added to the crew, the crew‘s flight duty period will be computed based
       on the flight duty period of the most limited person.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                    191


  A12.2.3. Runway, Taxiway, and Airfield Requirements. See Table 2.1. In all cases ensure
  obstacle clearance requirements are met. Landing distance will not exceed runway available.
  Crews will normally use 0.80 delayed braking factor (DBF) for computing landing distance.
  The pilot in command may direct using greater than 0.80 DBF as an exception on a case by
  case basis, but must be aware of the resultant increase in brake wear. OG/CC or equivalent
  approval is required for landing with greater than a 0.90 DBF. When using greater than 0.80
  DBF crews will brief the planned braking speed.
     A12.2.3.1. Runway Length for Takeoff and Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, takeoffs
     will be initiated from the beginning of the approved usable portion of the runway.
     Intersection takeoffs are authorized if the following conditions are met:
         A12.2.3.1.1. Pilots may accomplish intersection takeoffs provided the operating
         environment (i.e., gross weight, obstructions, climb criteria, weather, etc.) allows a
         safe takeoff and departure. Calculate takeoff performance based on the runway
         remaining from the point at which the takeoff is initiated. In no case will a takeoff be
         made from a position where less than 7000 feet of runway remains.
     A12.2.3.2. During operations on runways partially covered with snow or ice, takeoff
     computations will be based on the reported RSC or RCR for the cleared portion of the
     runway. A minimum of 50 feet either side of centerline should be cleared. If 50 feet
     either side of centerline is not cleared, then compute data based on the un-cleared portion
     up to 50 feet either side of centerline.
  A12.2.4. Operations over Runway Cables (does not include recessed cables).
     A12.2.4.1. Do not land on (touchdown on) approach end arresting cables (does not
     include recessed cables). If the aircraft lands before the cable, the crew should contact the
     tower to have the cable inspected.
     A12.2.4.2. Do not takeoff or land over an approach end cable that has been reported as
     slack, loose, or improperly rigged by NOTAM, ATIS, or ATC.
  A12.2.5. Minimum Runway Condition Report (RCR).
     A12.2.5.1. For 412 FLTS operations, on an active DV Airlift mission, RCR limits are a
     minimum of 7 for taxi and 9 for take-off and landing.
     A12.2.5.2. Operations from RAF Fairford and RAF Mildenhall. An RCR 15 may be
     used for computing takeoff performance for all operational and training missions when
     wet runway conditions exist. This authorization does not apply to landing data
     computations or when standing water is on the runway. Determination of standing water
     versus wet runway conditions will be made by the 100 OG/CC.
  A12.2.6. Non-Standard Fuel Loads. For depot operations, after the initial PDM FCF landing
  fuel load may be left ―as is‖ when fuel CG is in the range of 24-28%. This will result in a
  non-standard fuel load. Mission planning must take into account both the non-standard fuel
  load and FCF checks to be accomplished to ensure that the fuel is available and accessible in
  case of emergency and or divert.

A12.3. Common Mission Guidance.
   A12.3.1. Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC). Use ERCC procedures when necessary to
   expedite aircraft movement or permit the exchange of crewmembers. Pilot in command must
   assess prevailing weather, lighting and parking location to ensure safe operations. Unless
   otherwise published, use the following procedures:
       A12.3.1.1. Pilot in command will brief crewmembers on the intended ERCC operation to
       include their locations, duties, and responsibilities during the ERCC.
       A12.3.1.2. Crewmembers should ensure that all loose items are secure prior to entering
       and exiting the aircraft.
       A12.3.1.3. The parking brake will be set and at least one pilot in the seat will monitor
       brakes, interphone, and radio.
       A12.3.1.4. Use terrain and taxi lights to enhance safety at night as the situation dictates.
       A12.3.1.5. A crewmember should be positioned at the point of entry to act as a safety
       observer.
       A12.3.1.6. No enplaning personnel should approach the airplane until the crewmember is
       in place.
       A12.3.1.7. Crewmembers should approach and depart the aircraft from the nose. When
       departing crewmembers will proceed forward of the aircraft at least 50 feet before
       turning.
       A12.3.1.8. Brief deplaning personnel to secure loose articles and remain forward of the
       interphone cord.
       A12.3.1.9. Pilot in command will ensure that the aircraft is clear prior to taxi.
   A12.3.2. Formation Flying. Formation is authorized IAW applicable technical order and
   AFI 11-2KC135Volume 3, C/KC-135 Operating Procedures or AFI 11-2RC-135Volume 3,
   RC/OC/WC/TC-135 Operating Procedures.
   A12.3.3. Air Refueling Limitations.
       A12.3.3.1. Do not accomplish AR operations when:
          A12.3.3.1.1. Conditions result in marginal control of either aircraft or boom (in the
          opinion of either PIC or BO).
          A12.3.3.1.2. Either the tanker or the receiver has less than the full number of engines
          operating (except B-52).
          A12.3.3.1.3. The tanker aircraft is unable to retract the landing gear.
          A12.3.3.1.4. Pod Control Panel malfunction exists that cannot be resolved.
          A12.3.3.1.5. MPRS pod malfunction. NOTE: If Pod Control Panel is operational and
          only one pod is malfunctioning, AR is permissible with operational pod.
       A12.3.3.2. Tanker Autopilot. If a tanker pilot or receiver pilot is required to fly
       autopilot-off for qualification training, the pilot flying the opposing aircraft will be
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                 193


     qualified. Verbal notification and acknowledgment will take place between the tanker
     and receiver prior to conducting autopilot-off training.
     A12.3.3.3. A/R without Tanker Disconnect Capability. A/R without tanker disconnect
     capability means the boom operator cannot trigger an immediate disconnect. After a
     known loss of tanker disconnect capability with a particular receiver, no further contacts
     will be attempted with that receiver. The inability to get an immediate disconnect from
     one receiver by triggering a disconnect does not prohibit contact attempts with other
     receivers, if the tanker system (signal coil) checks good. However, if disconnects cannot
     be triggered on two successive receivers, no further contacts will be attempted.
        A12.3.3.3.1. Exceptions to the restrictions are:
            A12.3.3.3.1.1. During fuel emergency situations.
            A12.3.3.3.1.2. When necessary to complete receiver over-water deployment or
            redeployment.
            A12.3.3.3.1.3. Operational missions.
     A12.3.3.4. Manual/Emergency Boom Latch Training. The following conditions must be
     met in order to complete training or an evaluation in manual /emergency boom latching:
        A12.3.3.4.1. An AR IP must be at a set of controls during the receiver contacts.
        A12.3.3.4.2. Contacts will be limited to the minimum required.
        A12.3.3.4.3. The receiver aircraft AR system must be fully operable, and a
        disconnect capability with the receiver must have been previously determined by a
        boom operator initiated disconnect.
     A12.3.3.5. Prohibited Refueling Maneuvers. When operating in manual/emergency
     boom latching or when the tanker does not have disconnect capability, limit contacts to
     the minimum number necessary to complete mission requirements. The following
     maneuvers are prohibited:
        A12.3.3.5.1. Practice emergency separation while in contact.
        A12.3.3.5.2. Demonstration of envelope limits.
     A12.3.3.6. Practice Emergency Separations.
        A12.3.3.6.1. Prior to the actual accomplishment of a practice emergency separation,
        coordination between the tanker pilot, boom operator, and receiver pilot is mandatory.
        Coordination must include when the separation will occur and who will give the
        command of execution. Tanker pilot coordination may be accomplished over
        interphone with the boom operator.
        A12.3.3.6.2. If separation is initiated from the contact position, the receiver‘s A/R
        system must be in normal, and a boom operator disconnect capability with the
        receiver must exist.
        A12.3.3.6.3. Practice emergency separations will not be accomplished with
        passengers on board unless passengers are seated with seat belts fastened.
 194                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


       A12.3.3.7. Limits Demonstration. Prior to a limits demonstration, a disconnect capability
       must have been previously determined by a boom operator initiated disconnect.
       A12.3.3.8. Receiver AR Training. A qualified and current receiver IP will conduct
       training. The receiver pilot must inform and obtain acknowledgment from the tanker pilot
       and boom operator when an unqualified receiver pilot is receiving AR training. A boom
       operator qualified for the applicable category receiver must operate the boom controls,
       and if the tanker autopilot is off, the tanker must be flown by a pilot current and qualified
       in tanker AR.
       A12.3.3.9. Altitude. A/R operations are normally conducted above 12,000 feet MSL, or
       10,000 feet AGL, whichever is higher. A/R operations based at or above 12,000 feet
       MSL which momentarily fall below 10,000 feet AGL, but not lower than 5,000 feet
       AGL, due to overflight of mountain ridges, peaks, etc., are authorized. A/R operations in
       support of C-130 receivers at the receiver's optimum refueling altitude, but no lower than
       5,000 feet AGL are authorized. A/R performed below those altitudes will only be on an
       approved test plan or for other operational considerations approved by the OG/CC.
       Except as noted above, A/R operations below 6,000 feet AGL is considered Low Altitude
       Air Refueling (LAAR) and must comply with the following:
          A12.3.3.9.1. Consideration will be given to wearing helmets with visor down for
          protection against bird strikes. When available, a boom mike may be used to facilitate
          cross-cockpit communications.
          A12.3.3.9.2. A knowledgeable safety observer will be used to the maximum extent
          possible.
          A12.3.3.9.3. Maximum time per sortie for LAAR will be 1 hour.
          A12.3.3.9.4. Perform during day, under VFR conditions.
          A12.3.3.9.5. Minimum altitude is 3,000 feet above the highest obstacle or terrain
          within 4 NM of course centerline.
          A12.3.3.9.6. Forecast, reported, or observed winds less than or equal to 27 knots.
          A12.3.3.9.7. Less than forecast, reported or observed moderate turbulence.
          A12.3.3.9.8. Over flat and rolling terrain or a minimum of 10 NM from land over
          contiguous water.
          A12.3.3.9.9. The autopilot rudder axis or yaw damper will be used if functioning.
          Consideration will be given to not utilizing the other axes of the autopilot based upon
          maneuvering requirements.
          A12.3.3.9.10. Flight manual restrictions for low altitude operations will be complied
          with.
A12.4. Instrument Procedures.
   A12.4.1. Aircraft Category. The C-135 is approach category D.
   A12.4.2. Traffic Advisory and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). Operate the TCAS
   with sensitivity set to Traffic Advisory/Resolution Advisory (TA/RA) to the maximum
   extent possible. ATC procedures and the ―see and avoid concept‖ will continue to be the
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                   195


  primary means of ensuring aircraft separation. Pilots shall not deviate from an assigned ATC
  clearance based solely on TA information. Attempt to attain visual contact and maintain safe
  separation. However, if visual separation with the intruding traffic cannot be assured, it is
  imperative to follow resolution advisories (RA) to obtain aircraft separation computed by
  TCAS. Failure to follow the computed RA may increase the probability of a midair
  collision. Do not exceed aircraft structural limits or safe flight speed in order to follow the
  RA. Always attempt to visually clear the airspace before maneuvering your airplane in
  response to a TCAS advisory. Advise ATC as soon as practical when a deviation becomes
  necessary due to a TCAS resolution advisory.
  A12.4.3. Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (E-GPWS) and/or Terrain
  Awareness and Warning System (TAWS). When operating in the low altitude structure, it is
  imperative to follow E-GPWS advisories. Advise ATC as soon as practical when deviation
  from an ATC clearance is directed by E-GPWS/TAWS.
  A12.4.4. Aircraft Systems Operations and Navigation Procedures
     A12.4.4.1. MFD. Pilot Flying (PF) must have a MFD with the full ADI for all takeoffs,
     final approaches and landings. Course guidance (other than stick map) appropriate for
     the current ATC clearance, will be displayed on a PF MFD. EXCEPTION: When
     malfunctions limit the pilot to a single operable MFD.
     A12.4.4.2. Weather Radar. Configure the weather radar based on mission requirements.
     For Pacer CRAG: The Predictive Wind Shear (PWS) function of the weather radar
     should normally be operating for all takeoffs, approaches, and landings.
     A12.4.4.3. Flight Progress.
         A12.4.4.3.1. Prior to flight, plot the oceanic portion of the flight on an appropriate
         chart. Annotate the chart with the mission number, AC's name, preparer‘s name, and
         date. If practical, chart may be reused.
         A12.4.4.3.2. The PIC will ensure the navigation waypoints loaded in the INS (FMS
         for Pacer CRAG) flight plan accurately reflect the intended/cleared route of flight.
         This can be done using one or more of the following methods:
             A12.4.4.3.2.1. Latitude/longitude from current FLIP
             A12.4.4.3.2.2. Bearing/distance from a flight plan after latitude/longitude are
             verified for each waypoint.
             A12.4.4.3.2.3. Ground Based NAVAIDS.
         A12.4.4.3.3. In-Flight, use all available NAVAIDS to monitor INS performance.
         Immediately report malfunctions or any loss of navigation capability, which degrades
         centerline accuracy to the controlling ARTCC. Use the following procedures for
         flight progress:
         A12.4.4.3.4. Obtain a coast out fix prior to, or immediately on entering the Category
         I Route or over-water segment. Perform a gross error check using available
         NAVAIDs and annotate the position and time on the chart.
         A12.4.4.3.5. When approaching each waypoint, recheck coordinates for the next
         waypoint.
196                            AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


      A12.4.4.3.6. Approximately 10 minutes after passing each oceanic waypoint, record
      and plot the aircraft position and time on the chart, and ensure compliance with
      courses and ETA tolerances.
      A12.4.4.3.7. If a revised clearance is received, record and plot the new route of flight
      on the chart.
      A12.4.4.3.8. For Pacer CRAG, periodically check all solution position differentials
      on the INAV pages.
      A12.4.4.3.9. Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace. Airspace
      where RVSM is applied is considered special qualification airspace. See FLIP GP for
      aircraft equipment requirements. Both the operator and the specific aircraft must be
      approved for operations in these areas. Always refer to the appropriate Area Planning
      (AP) publication for specific theater RVSM requirements.
      A12.4.4.3.10. Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Airspace. Airspace where
      RNP is applied is considered special qualification airspace. Both the operator and the
      specific aircraft type must be approved for operations in these areas. The PIC is
      responsible for a thorough review of the aircraft forms and maintenance logs to
      ascertain the status of RNP equipment. Document (in the aircraft forms)
      malfunctions or failures of RNP required equipment, including the failure of this
      equipment to meet RNP tolerances.
         A12.4.4.3.10.1. RNP-10. Compliance includes navigation accuracy within 10NM
                 of actual position 95% of the time. Aircraft not possessing integrated GPS
         with receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM), or equivalent system, are
         limited in how long they may operate in RNP-10 airspace. See FLIP for RPN-10
         long term requirements/aircraft capabilities. KC-135 aircraft with properly
         functioning steering solutions may operate in RNP-10 airspace without time
         limitations. If the capability to update the inertial navigation solution with the
         GPS is lost, or if the receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) is lost, the
         aircraft is limited to 6.2 hours of operation in RNP-10 airspace after the GPS or
         RAIM is degraded.
         A12.4.4.3.10.2. Enroute. At least two long-range navigation systems certified for
         RNP-10 must be operational at the oceanic entry point. Periodic crosschecks will
         be accomplished to identify navigation errors and prevent inadvertent deviation
         from ATC cleared routes. Advise ATC of the deterioration or failure of
         navigation equipment below navigation performance requirements and coordinate
         appropriate actions.
      A12.4.4.3.11. Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV) Airspace. BRNAV is defined as
      RNAV with an accuracy that meets RNP-5 for operations under IFR in that European
      airspace designated for BRNAV/RNP-5 operations. When operating in BRNAV
      airspace, aircrews will immediately notify ATC if any of the required equipment fails,
      or is unable to meet BRNAV tolerances. Document in the aircraft forms malfunctions
      or failures of RNP required equipment including the failure of this equipment to meet
      BRNAV tolerances. The KC-135 is approved for BRNAV operations.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                 197


        A12.4.4.3.12. MNPS Airspace Operations. Operations within the North Atlantic
        area‘s MNPS airspace, Canadian MNPS, or selected Pacific routes are designed for
        INS-auto-pilot coupled operation. (See FLIP AP/2, chapter 5 and AFI 11-202,
        Volume 3, General Flight Rules). When not engaged in AR operations, aircrews will
        adhere to these procedures. Comply with FLIP for operations in North Atlantic
        Minimum Navigation Performance Specification Airspace, and US West Coast to
        Hawaii Route System Procedures.
           A12.4.4.3.12.1. Malfunctioning equipment that reduces the aircrew‘s capability
           to comply with MNPS, whether occurring prior to, or within MNPS airspace, will
           immediately be reported to the controlling agency and subsequent agencies
           throughout the route of flight. Prior to airspace entry, aircrews will return to the
           nearest maintenance repair facility unless the aircraft has a minimum of two
           operable and correctly functioning INUs, unless specifically cleared to proceed
           along original, or revised routing by the controlling agency. If subsequent failures
           occur, advise ARTCC, comply with track restrictions, and use all means available
           (HF DR, dead reckoning, etc) to ensure navigation accuracy.
           A12.4.4.3.12.2. When flying in MNPS airspace, exercise special caution to
           ensure the coordinates of the assigned track and associated landfall and domestic
           routings are fully understood and correctly inserted into the automatic DR
           navigation system with appropriate cross-checks. If at any time the route (re-
           routing, if appropriate) is in doubt, check the details with ARTCC facility.
           A12.4.4.3.12.3. When flying in MNPS airspace, crews will utilize Strategic
           Lateral Offset Procedures (SLOP) to the max extent possible. Refer to the MNPS
           Manual and AFI 11-217 for further information on SLOP.
        A12.4.4.3.13. Inoperative Navigation Systems (Oceanic systems include: INU-1,
        INU-2, and GPS with RAIM).
           A12.4.4.3.13.1. One unit inoperative: Advise ARTCC unless within range of
           normal radio aids. Plot position on navigation chart every 30 minutes. Check the
           accuracy of remaining nav systems, using all available NAVAIDs.
           A12.4.4.3.13.2. Two units inoperative: Advise ARTCC. Cross-check compass
           system heading with mission plan at each waypoint or every 30 minutes. Verify
           last recorded position on chart. Use flight plan as guide. Use ADF, VOR/DME,
           weather radar ground mapping mode, to update estimated positions. If desired
           and other methods fail, try to obtain an HF DF fix. This service can be requested
           through the regular ARTCC frequencies.
           A12.4.4.3.13.3. Differences Between Navigation Systems. When there is a
                   difference between navigation systems, normally two of the three will be
           in close proximity, so that it will be simple to determine that the malfunctioning
           system is the one, which is most distant from the other two. When available,
           check position using available ground NAVAIDs. Comparing the doppler
           groundspeed with the groundspeed derived from each system may also provide a
           good indication of a malfunctioning system.
  A12.4.5. RNAV Operations.
 198                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


       A12.4.5.1. KC-135R (BLK 40) (IAW FAA AC 90-100A and KC-135 (BLK 40)
       airworthiness certification) aircraft are approved for unrestricted RNAV/RNP 1,
       RNAV/P-RNAV/RNP 2, NAV/RNP 4, BRNAV, RNP operations and RNP 0.3, lateral
       navigation (LNAV) only procedures.
          A12.4.5.1.1. All pilots/navigators (if applicable) must complete KC135 RNAV/GPS
          Operations Certification training before utilizing RNAV 1 (SIDs & STARs) and
          RNAV 2 ("Q" & "T" routes) airspace or RNP 0.3 RNAV (LNAV minima)
          approaches. Training requirements are located on the AFMC/A3V CoP. The AFMC
          training overview (word document) provides the appropriate training guidance.
          A12.4.5.1.2. The KC-135 aircraft is not authorized to fly "overlay GPS approaches",
          due to concerns about the ability to accurately code the missed approach portion of
          these procedures. "Overlay GPS approaches" are characterized by "Or GPS" in the
          title (i.e. VOR or GPS RWY 15), these approaches are designed differently from
          RNAV, RNAV (GPS) and GPS approaches, because overlays are designed around
          ground based NAVAIDs and interpreted for space based navigation. This does not
          preclude the use of "GPS in lieu of" to define individual points on a conventional
          approach, such as a final approach fix defined by an NDB for an aircraft that is not
          equipped with an NDB; crews can still use GPS to define these individual points IAW
          11-217V1 paragraph 7.12.4.
          A12.4.5.1.3. GPS overlays of conventional SIDs and STARs found in aircraft
          database are only authorized for situational awareness and require the pilots to use the
          ground based NAVAIDs as their primary navigational source, where RNAV SIDs
          and STARs do not require the use of ground based NAVAIDs.
          A12.4.5.1.4. When flying RNAV SIDs KC-135 crews will accomplish a gyro takeoff
          and ensure pilot flying's primary course as a minimum is set to FMS. The crew will
          ensure the flight directors are set to NAV/LOC to provide flight director guidance
          prior to reaching 500 feet AGL, IAW FAA Advisory Circular 90-100A.
          A12.4.5.1.5. Flight director lateral guidance must be available anytime the KC-135 is
          operating in RNP 0.3 airspace IAW KC-135 (BLK 40) performance assessment
          summary.
          A12.4.5.1.6. HQ AFFSA/A30 has determined KC-135 (BLK 40) RNAV instrument
          approach procedures are in compliance with 11-217V1 paragraph 7.13.5.2, despite
          the current FMS software's inability to display leg length to a tenth of a mile in the
          flight plan pages prior to flight. To mitigate this software limitation, crews are
          required to evaluate distance-to-fly displayed as the FMS sequences to the next point
          against the chart value while flying the approach. If significant deviations from the
          expected values are witnessed the pilot should consider aborting the approach.
A12.5. Operational Procedures and Restrictions.
   A12.5.1. Flight Duty Period. Observe AFI 11-202 Vol. 3 Chapter 9 restrictions, and the
   following:
       A12.5.1.1. Basic Crew FDP.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                     199


          A12.5.1.1.1. Maximum FDP for a basic crew is IAW AFI 11-202v3. Reduce this
          period to 12 hours without an operative autopilot altitude hold. If the autopilot fails
          after departure, continue to the next scheduled stop and then comply with this
          restriction.
      A12.5.1.2. Augmented Crew FDP.
          A12.5.1.2.1. Maximum FDP for an augmented crew (operational missions only) is
          IAW AFI 11-202v3. Reduce this period to 16 hours without an operative autopilot
          altitude hold. In this case, only the pilot portion of the crew need be augmented.
          A12.5.1.2.2. Basic crews will not be augmented after FDP has started.
          A12.5.1.2.3. Authorized only for a maximum of four intermediate stops/sorties.
          Sorties are defined as stops for the purpose of refueling or stops with significant
          ground time/delay. Waiver authority is the OG/CC.
   A12.5.2. Duty Station. The pilot, copilot, flight engineer, navigator, and boom operator will
   be at their duty stations during all critical phases of flight. During other phases of flight,
   crewmembers may leave their duty station to meet physiological needs and to perform
   normal crew duties. During cruise flight, the flight engineer, navigator, or boom operator
   may leave his/her duty station for longer periods with pilot approval. Crewmembers will
   notify the pilot in command prior to departing assigned primary duty stations.
   A12.5.3. Control Cabin Entry. Pilot in command may authorize passengers and observers
   access to the control cabin during all phases of flight. In all cases, sufficient oxygen sources
   must be available to meet the requirements of AFI 11-202, Volume 3. Passengers or
   observers will not be permitted access to the pilot or copilot position regardless of its
   availability. Exceptions are IAW AFI 11-401/AFMC Sup 1.
A12.5.4. Command Radios.
      A12.5.4.1. The pilot not flying the aircraft normally makes all ATC radio calls.
      A12.5.4.2. In terminal areas the pilot, copilot, navigator, flight engineer, and boom
      operator will monitor the primary command radio unless directed otherwise.
      A12.5.4.3. The pilot operating the command radios will inform the crew when the
      primary radio is changed.
      A12.5.4.4. One pilot should record and will acknowledge all ATC clearances. The
      navigator or boom operator will monitor the read-back and will ensure compliance with
      all clearances.
      A12.5.4.5. Both pilots will monitor UHF guard (or VHF guard when appropriate)
      emergency frequency regardless of primary radio. EXCEPTION: Only one crewmember
      is required to monitor guard frequency during tanker or receiver rendezvous and A/R.
      During tanker A/R, the PNF normally monitors guard.
   A12.5.5. Fuel Jettison Procedures. Use jettison altitudes above 20,000-feet AGL to the
   maximum extent possible. If jettison is accomplished, record all pertinent data to include
   flight conditions, altitude, airspeed, air temperature, wind direction and velocity, type and
   amount of fuel, aircraft type and position at time of jettison, time and duration of jettison
200                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


  activity, and reason jettison was accomplished. Retain this information for 6 months as
  documentation in the event of claim against the government resulting from the fuel jettison.
  A12.5.6. Qualification Training. Initial qualification, re-qualification, or upgrade training
  for pilots will not be conducted on missions with passengers onboard. Mission qualification
  or mission instructor training may be conducted on missions with passengers onboard only if
  the individual in training is qualified (completed aircraft checkride with a valid AF Form 8).
  A12.5.7. Three-Engine Ferry Operations. Consider three-engine ferry operations only after
  exhausting all other options to return an aircraft with an inoperative engine to full mission
  ready status. Each three-engine ferry sortie must be approved IAW AFI 11-202Vol 3 AFMC
  Sup 1. The owning MAJCOM will provide execution authority for these sorties. The
  following procedures apply:
      A12.5.7.1. Plan ferry operations well ahead to allow sufficient time for completion of
      maintenance preparation actions.
      A12.5.7.2. Plan the flight to the nearest destination possessing a usable maintenance
      support capability. Obtain clearances and alert all en route, alternate, and abort bases
      along the intended route of flight.
      A12.5.7.3. Use the minimum crew necessary for the ferry operation. Do not carry
      passengers or other non-essential personnel. Observe aircraft flight manual limitations.
      A12.5.7.4. All primary aircraft systems not associated with the failed engine must be
      fully operational.
      A12.5.7.5. Performance data must satisfy takeoff field length requirements, gear down 3-
      engine climb performance, and final segment two-engine asymmetric go-around
      capability.
      A12.5.7.6. Download cargo (including mission support kits) prior to ferry operations.
  A12.5.8. Power Management Control (PMC) Operations. The pilot in command may
  (authorize) takeoff with one PMC inoperative. Do not turn off an operational PMC to
  practice a PMC inoperative takeoff. Simulated three-engine approaches and touch-and-go
  landings are not authorized with a PMC inoperative.
  A12.5.9. Flight Maneuvers. The following maneuvers are authorized for qualification and
  continuation training. They are applicable to all mission and series C-135 aircraft, except
  when prohibited or restricted by the flight manual, partial/modification flight manual or other
  applicable directives. Direct instructor-pilot (IP) super-vision requires the IP to have
  immediate access to the controls. Comply with Training Restrictions in Table 9.2 of this
  instruction and the following:
      A12.5.9.1. Simulated Engine Failure. Perform practice or simulated loss of engines IAW
      this instruction, the applicable flight manual.
      A12.5.9.2. Approach and Landing, Simulated Engine-Out (direct IP supervision).
      A12.5.9.3. Approach and Go-Around, Simulated Engine-Out (Power Rudder On). A
      planned three-engine go-around may be started at any time before the power is reduced in
      the flare. For an unplanned go-around use all four engines as soon as safe and practical.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                 201


     A12.5.9.4. Approach and Go-Around, Simulated Engine-Out (Power Rudder Off) (direct
     IP supervision). This maneuver will not be accomplished unless an IP has briefed the
     maneuver prior to flight. The go-around will be started no lower than 200 AGL. For an
     unplanned go-around, use all four engines as soon as safe and practical.
     A12.5.9.5. Simulated Engine Failure Takeoff Continued (direct IP supervision).
     A12.5.9.6. Simulated 2-Engine Approach/Landing (direct IP supervision). May be
     practiced using two symmetric engines or three engines using two-engine procedures.
     Two-engine approaches and landings will not be practiced in an extensively modified
     aircraft. NOTE: During a go-around or missed approach, use the asymmetric engine as
     required to ensure at least a 3.3% climb gradient.
     A12.5.9.7. Simulated Jammed Stabilizer Demonstration (spoiler use only) (direct IP
     supervision).
     A12.5.9.8. Landing Attitude Demonstration (IP supervised).
     A12.5.9.9. Spoiler/Lateral Control Demonstration (IP supervised).
     A12.5.9.10. Trim Demonstration (IP supervised).
  A12.5.10. Touch-and-Go Landing Limitations.
     A12.5.10.1. Touch and Go landings may be performed under direct instructor pilot
     supervision or by a certified mission pilot IAW this instruction, AFI 11-2FTV1, and the
     applicable flight manual. Refer to AFI 11-2FT Vol. 1 as supplemented for specific touch
     and go training requirements, restrictions and approved airfields (without IP).
     A12.5.10.2. Touch-and-go landings with passengers are prohibited. Civilian employees
     under direct contract to the DoD and MAJCOM approved maintenance personnel
     engaged in official direct mission support activities are considered mission essential and
     may be onboard when touch-and-go landings are performed under MEGP status.
     A12.5.10.3. Brief touch-and-go landing considerations with the other appropriate aircrew
     members prior to final approach. On successive approaches, if the briefing remains the
     same and there are no questions, the briefing need not be repeated.
  A12.5.11. Prohibited maneuvers. The following maneuvers, in addition to those already
  specified in applicable flight manuals, are prohibited unless part of an approved test plan,
  USAF TPS curriculum, FCF profile, or an actual emergency exists.
     A12.5.11.1. Stalls.
     A12.5.11.2. Initial Buffet.
     A12.5.11.3. Dutch Roll.
     A12.5.11.4. Emergency Descent.
     A12.5.11.5. Simulated 3 engine, rudder power-off landings.
     A12.5.11.6. Compound Emergencies (except simulated engine-out with rudder power or
     EFAS off).
     A12.5.11.7. Takeoffs and landings with the EFAS off.
202                              AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


      A12.5.11.8. Actual practice engine shutdown.
  A12.5.12. Operating Limitations. Unless specifically authorized elsewhere in this section,
  do not practice emergency procedures that degrade aircraft performance or flight control
  capabilities (in-flight).
      A12.5.12.1. In-flight, prior to simulating emergency procedures (EP), the pilot will
      notify all crewmembers.
      A12.5.12.2. In the event of an actual emergency, all student training and simulated EPs
      will be terminated. Training will resume only when the pilot in command has determined
      that no hazard to safe aircraft operations exist.
      A12.5.12.3. Rudder power will be on for all takeoffs and landings. The EFAS will be on
      for all C/KC-135R/T takeoffs and landings.
      A12.5.12.4. Do not practice traffic pattern operations, instrument approaches, low
      approaches or go-around at gross weights that will not afford a minimum of 500 feet per
      minute rate of climb at approach speed, three engines, flaps-30, gear-up (gear-down for
      emergency procedures practice).
  A12.5.13. Landing Limitations. The following landing limitations apply to both touch-and-
  go and full stop landings:
      A12.5.13.1. Gross weight. Landing gross weights will be at a gross weight that will
      permit a safe, full stop landing in the runway available. At gross weights above 200,000
      pounds pilot will brief and comply with flight manual sink rate limitations.
      A12.5.13.2. Flap Setting. Do not practice landings with less than 30 degree flaps. Full
      stop landings should normally be made with 50 degree flap settings. Consideration
      should be given to runway length, landing distance (including flare and stopping
      distance), crosswinds, RCR, and other factors influencing the landing ground roll in
      deciding to land with less than 50 degrees of flaps.
      A12.5.13.3. Multiple Full Stop Landings.       Compute brake energy prior to each
      subsequent takeoff.
      A12.5.13.4. Final Landing Fuel. Final landing fuel will not be less than 5,900 pounds.
      Engineering analysis has proven that engine fuel starvation is imminent past this point.
  A12.5.14. Zero-Degree Flap Approach. Do not practice zero-degree flap approaches unless
  an instructor pilot has access to a set of flight controls and no emergencies (actual or
  simulated) exist. The approach will be terminated no lower than 200 feet AGL.
  A12.5.15. Practice Emergency or Abnormal Gear and Flap Operation. Accomplish clear of
  clouds (not applicable when IP-supervised). May be accomplished day or night.
  A12.5.16. Simulated Instrument Flight. Artificial vision restricting devices are not
  authorized for any phase of flight unless as part of an approved flight test plan. Simulated
  instrument flight may be flown and logged without the use of a vision-restricting device.

                                          Attachment 14
                               F-4 OPERATING PROCEDURES

A14.1. General Information. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives,
outlines procedures for operation of the F-4 aircraft under most circumstances. It applies to
AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of all F-4 series aircraft.
Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe,
effective mission accomplishment.
A14.2. Mission Planning.
   A14.2.1. TOLD will be calculated for every sortie using the current Flight Planning System.
   Off station crews may utilize the performance section of 1F-4(R)C-1CL or contact flight test
   operations to use specified software. There is no requirement to calculate or post a No-Chute
   Max Abort speed."
A14.3. Common Mission Guidance.
   A14.3.1. Formation Procedures.
       A14.3.1.1. Formation Takeoffs and Formation landings are prohibited.
       A14.3.1.2. Close Formation. Wingmen must maintain wingtip clearance by flying a
       position that aligns the forward tips of the lead aircraft's stabilator and puts the aft join-up
       light in the star on the fuselage. Keep this position throughout all turns.
A14.4. Instrument Procedures.
   A14.4.1. The F-4 is approach category E.
A14.5. Operating Procedures and Restrictions.
   A14.5.1. Maneuvering Parameters. T.O. 1F-4C-1, TPS Guides and applicable phase
   manuals in addition to this instruction will be used to define and describe the performance of
   stalls, confidence maneuvers, aerobatics, or advanced handling maneuvers.
   A14.5.2. Rig/Stab Aug checks are required prior to the performance of stalls, confidence
   maneuvers, or other maximum performance/high AOA maneuvering.
       A14.5.2.1. Do not maneuver the aircraft at high AOA if an out-of-rig condition,
       malfunctioning Stab Aug, or asymmetrical load exists. Fly a straight-in approach for
       landing.
       A14.5.2.2. The Roll channel of the Stab Aug will be disengaged for stalls, confidence
       maneuvers, and other maneuvers in which rudder rolls or reversals will be accomplished.
   A14.5.3. Maneuvering Limitations. All flight maneuvering, except stall demonstrations and
   confidence maneuvers, is limited to a maximum of 19.2 units AOA, excessive wing rock, or
   200 KIAS, whichever occurs first. A radio call to "Knock-It-Off" is normally required;
   however, at 200 KIAS primary attention will be devoted to regaining an adequate energy
   state. Stall demonstrations, confidence maneuvers, and indexer light orientations are limited
   to 120 KIAS.
   A14.5.4. Approach to Stalls Restrictions:
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                    205


     A14.5.4.1. An IP is required in the aircraft for all stall demonstrations (except FCF
     missions).
     A14.5.4.2. Initiate recovery at the first indication of nose rise, nose slice, 30 degree wing
     rock, or build-up of side forces (tendency to move pilot to the side of the cockpit),
     whichever occurs first. If no stall indications occur, initiate recovery not to exceed 25
     units AOA; initiate landing configuration stall recoveries at 22.3 units AOA (pedal
     shaker).
     A14.5.4.3. Stall recoveries will be IAW the flight manual.
     A14.5.4.4. Minimum entry altitude is 15,000 feet AGL, maximum entry altitude is
     25,000 feet MSL (20,000 feet MSL for accelerated & landing configuration stalls).
     Minimum altitude during recovery is 5,000 feet AGL.
     A14.5.4.5. Approach to Accelerated Stalls. Discontinue the maneuver if the stall
     indications have not been observed before decelerating through 300 KIAS.
  A14.5.5. Approach to Stall Demonstration Maneuvers.
     A14.5.5.1. 1G stall approaches (clean/gear-flap configurations): Power is set at 80-85
     percent.
     A14.5.5.2. Accelerated Stall Approaches:
        A14.5.5.2.1. Power is set at military
        A14.5.5.2.2. Entry airspeed is 350-400 knots.
  A14.5.6. Confidence Maneuvers.
     A14.5.6.1. Minimum entry altitude is at or above 15,000 feet AGL to be recovered by
     10,000 feet AGL. Entry airspeed is 300 knots for all maneuvers; ensure power is at MIL
     NLT 200 knots. Minimum airspeed is 120 knots.
     A14.5.6.2. AOA Recovery. Set and maintain a 45-60 degree climb. At 200 knots,
     establish and maintain 3 to 8 units AOA. Recover at 250 knots.
     A14.5.6.3. Low AOA Rolls. Set and maintain a 45-60 degree climb. At 200 knots,
     establish and maintain 3 to 8 units AOA and roll the aircraft 360 degrees with ailerons.
     Maintain 3 to 8 units AOA with wings level upright. Recover at 250 knots.
     A14.5.6.4. High AOA Roll. Set and maintain a 30 degree climb At 200 knots (approx 10
     to 15 units AOA), roll the aircraft 360 degrees with rudder; maintain 16 to 18 units AOA
     throughout rudder roll. Stop the roll with opposite rudder and reestablish/maintain 3 to 8
     units AOA. Recover at 250 knots.
     A14.5.6.5. Inverted Recovery. Set and maintain a 45-60 degree climb. At 200 knots,
     establish and maintain 3 to 8 units AOA and roll the aircraft 180 degrees with ailerons.
     Maintain 3 to 8 units AOA inverted until 200 knots (CAUTION: Too much forward stick
     could cause a negative-G inverted stall). At 200 knots, roll the aircraft upright and
     maintain 3 to 8 units AOA. Recover at 250 knots.
 206                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


       A14.5.6.6. For all recoveries expect degrees nose low while at 3 to 8 units AOA to equal
       degrees nose high from initial entry; i.e. expect to initiate recovery from 45-60 degrees
       nose low on all but the High AOA roll (30 degrees).
    A14.5.7. Advanced Handling Maneuvers.
       A14.5.7.1. Minimum altitude for advanced handling is 5,000 feet AGL (10,000 feet
       AGL over water); maximum AOA is 19.2 units and minimum airspeed is 200 knots. Use
       parameters IAW F-4 Advanced Handling Maneuvers in Table A14.1.
    A14.5.8. Unusual Attitude Recoveries.
       A14.5.8.1. An IP/SEFE is required for all Unusual Attitude Recoveries.
       A14.5.8.2. Nose-Low Recovery. Confirm unusual attitude exists. Set power and roll to
       nearest horizon while pulling max available G until on-speed. If > 420 knots, set power
       at idle and extend speedbrakes; if <420 knots, select afterburners. Maintain on-speed
       until recovered. A14.5.8.3. Nose-High Recovery. Confirm unusual attitude exists. If
       >250 knots, execute Inverted Recovery (IAW para A14.6.6.5) in MIL/afterburner as
       required. If <250 knots, execute AOA Recovery (IAW para A14.5.6.2.) in afterburner.
       IMC/Simulated IMC recoveries will roll to a maximum of 90 degrees of bank.
    A14.5.9. Aerobatic Maneuvers.
       A14.5.9.1. Minimum altitude for aerobatics is 5,000 feet AGL; maximum AOA is 19.2

   (verbatim and in order) listed in the applicable checklist.
   A15.2.3. Low Altitude Map Preparation / Terrain Following (TF) Flight Map.
       A15.2.3.1. On all low altitude flights, each aircraft in the flight will contain a minimum
       of one Chart Handbook Manual (CHUM) updated map of the low altitude route or
       training areas. The map will be of a scale and quality that terrain features, hazards, and
       chart annotations are of sufficient detail to allow navigation and safe mission
       accomplishment.
       A15.2.3.2. Annotate all maps with a Route Abort Altitude (RAA). Compute the RAA for
       the entire route/area at a minimum of 1,000 feet (2000‘ in mountainous terrain) above the
       highest obstacle/terrain (rounded up to the next 100 feet) within the lateral limits of the
       route or training area, but in no case less than 5NM either side of planned route.
       A15.2.3.3. For TF flight, annotate a Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) for each leg of the
       intended route of flight. MSA is defined as an altitude that provides 1000 feet of
       clearance above the highest obstacle/terrain (rounded up to the next 100 feet) within
       5NM of the planned course.
       A15.2.3.4. Planned night turn point bank angles should reflect system limitations to
       ensure maps accurately display planned routes. Flight leads should select TF letdown
       points that avoid initial descents into rugged or mountainous terrain at night (defined by
       TO 1F-15E-1 as any vertical change that exceeds 900 ft/NM).
   A15.2.4. Briefing/Debriefing.
       A15.2.4.1. Emphasize low altitude flight maneuvering, obstacle and ground avoidance,
       Low Altitude Warning System (LAWS) features and limitations, low altitude comfort
       level, and complacency avoidance on all low-level mission briefings. For low altitude
       training over water and featureless terrain, include specific considerations with emphasis
       on minimum altitudes and spatial disorientation.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                     209


      A15.2.4.2. Weapon Systems Officers (WSOs) should brief items applicable to rear
      cockpit duties during the mission.
   A15.2.5. Stowing Equipment in Bay 5 (F-15A/C). Stow containers or baggage with hard
   sides inside a Bay 5 cargo container. Without a cargo container, stow only soft-sided
   personal equipment baggage, such as hang-up or A-3 bags, in Bay 5. Items stowed in Bay 5
   will be positioned so as not to interfere with circuit breakers, test equipment, and ICS cables.
   Items should be secured with non-stretchable cord in such a manner to prevent movement in
   all three axes of motion. The pilot is responsible for ensuring items stowed in Bay 5 are
   loaded correctly and properly secured. The carriage restrictions for the Bay 5 cargo container
   are identical to the MXU-648/A cargo pod except for the airspeed restriction, which does not
   apply. Aircraft with items stowed in Bay 5 will not perform aerobatics but may execute
   tactical intercept missions restricted to LIMITED maneuvering. Do not execute zero or
   negative G maneuvers unless safety of flight dictates.
A15.3. Common Mission Guidance.
   A15.3.1. Ground Visual Signals. When ground intercom is not used, use visual signals IAW
   AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movements on the Ground and this volume. The
   following signals augment AFI 11-218.
      A15.3.1.1. Jet Fuel Starter (JFS) Start: With clenched fist, pilot makes a pulling motion.
      A15.3.1.2. Flight Controls Check: Raise arm, clench fist, and make a stirring motion.
      A15.3.1.3. Brake Check: Hold left or right arm horizontal, open hand and push forward,
      breaking at the wrist (as in applying rudder pedal pressure with feet).
      A15.3.1.4. Digital Electronic Engine Control (DEEC), Improved Digital Electronic
      Engine Control (IDEEC)/Automatic Thrust Departure Prevention System (ATDPS)
      Check: With the fingers and thumb of each hand extended and joined at the tips, open
      and close the fingers and thumbs of both hands simultaneously, simulating nozzle
      opening and closing.
      A15.3.1.5. Target Pod Clear: Extend arm and rotate a closed fist in a circular motion.
   A15.3.2. Taxi / Takeoff. If the computed military power takeoff distance exceeds one-half
   of the available runway, takeoff using afterburner.
   A15.3.3. Join-Up/Rejoin. Flight leaders will maintain 350 KCAS until join-up is
   accomplished unless mission requirements necessitate a different airspeed.
   A15.3.4. Tactical Formation.
      A15.3.4.1. Wingmen/trail elements will cross above the lead/lead element when
      deconfliction is required during tactical maneuvering.
      A15.3.4.2. De-confliction Responsibilities. The wingman is responsible for flight path
      deconfliction during tactical maneuvering unless he calls ―Padlocked", ―Blind‖, or
      ―Engaged‖ and flight lead acknowledges.
   A15.3.5. Minimum Altitudes.
      A15.3.5.1. Nose high, low speed recoveries and Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC)
      vertical maneuvers: 10,000 feet AGL.
210                              AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


      A15.3.5.2. Aerobatics: 5,000 feet AGL.
  A15.3.6. Radio Procedures.
      A15.3.6.1. Any flight member may make a "Knock-It-Off" or "Terminate" call IAW AFI
      11-214. A KIO applies to any phase of flight and any type of mission.
  A15.3.7. Air-to-Air Weapons Employment.
      A15.3.7.1. Simulated Gun Employment. Missions may be flown with a loaded gun
      provided the gun is safe IAW TO 1F-15A/ E-34-1-1-CL-1 and a trigger check is
      performed prior to the first engagement. Never perform a trigger check with a hot gun,
      regardless of Master Arm switch position.
      A15.3.7.2. Maneuvering Limitations. Minimum airspeed during low altitude offensive
      or defensive maneuvering (LOWAT) is 350 KCAS.
  A15.3.8. Air-to-Surface Weapons Employment.
      A15.3.8.1. Simulated Attacks against Off-Range or Manned Targets May be conducted,
      to include use of Master Arm and A/G Master Mode, when carrying practice ordnance
      under the following restrictions:
         A15.3.8.1.1. No live or carted heavyweight inert A/G ordnance, or live A/A missiles
         are loaded.
         A15.3.8.1.2. The A/G training mode is used on the Programmable Armament
         Control Set (PACS).
         A15.3.8.1.3. Stations loaded with carted practice ordnance are not selected on the
         training PACS.
         A15.3.8.1.4. The combat laser may be used only in approved areas.
      A15.3.8.2. Loft Recovery Procedures in Night or IMC Conditions. Escape maneuvers
      following loft deliveries are instrument recoveries which exceed numerous TF limits.
      Use the following procedures to manually recover to within TF limits:
         A15.3.8.2.1. Recovery Initiation Altitude (RIA) is the sum of the escape corridor
         MSA and altitude lost during the dive recovery. Compute RIA for the planned escape
         corridor. The escape corridor is defined as a 10NM wide corridor, starting at the
         planned roll out point and extending for 8NM along the egress heading. The MSA is
         1,000 feet above the highest obstacle within the corridor, rounded up to the nearest
         100 feet.
         A15.3.8.2.2. Following release, roll to 120-135 degrees of bank and execute a 4-5G
         slicing turn. As the nose passes the horizon, decrease bank angle to 90 degrees and
         continue to decrease bank angle to keep the nose from dropping lower than 10
         degrees nose low. Roll out on egress heading or upon reaching 10 degrees nose low
         and follow TF steering when it appears. If approaching RIA before rolling out, or
         before TF steering appears, pull to recover at or above MSA.
         A15.3.8.2.3. An Electronic Attitude Director Indicator (EADI) will be displayed in
         both cockpits throughout the loft maneuver and recovery.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                    211


        A15.3.8.2.4. If the TF system fails during recovery, maintain the appropriate
        minimum altitude (RAA/MSA) that provides terrain clearance.
        A15.3.8.2.5. If at any time during a low altitude, nose-high LANTIRN weapons
        delivery (loft) or recovery, airspeed drops below 300 KCAS, abort the maneuver and
        recover. Direct primary emphasis towards aircraft attitude, altitude and regaining
        airspeed.
     A15.3.8.3. Pop-Up Attacks. Abort pop-up attacks if airspeed decreases below 350 KCAS
     (300 KCAS above 10,000 feet AGL).
  A15.3.9. Low Altitude Procedures.
     A15.3.9.1. Fly low level formation positions/tactics using AFTTP 3-1vMDS, AFTTP 3-
     3vMDS as guides.
        A15.3.9.1.1. Line abreast formation is authorized at or above 300 feet AGL. When
        flying below 300 feet AGL, direct the wingman to a wedge formation position.
     A15.3.9.2. Obstacles:
        A15.3.9.2.1. All obstacle avoidance planning will be based on Minimum Safe
        Altitude (MSA) and Route Abort Altitude (RAA).
        A15.3.9.2.2. If unable to visually acquire or ensure lateral separation from known
        obstacles that could be a factor to the flight, flight leads will direct a climb not later
        than 3 NM prior to ensure sufficient vertical separation. Do not descend back into the
        low level environment until visual with the obstacle or positional awareness dictates it
        is safe to do so.
        A15.3.9.2.3. Low Altitude Warning System (LAWS) equipped aircraft. During all
        low altitude operations the LAWS will be set at 90 percent of the briefed minimum
        altitude or 90 percent of the command-directed minimum altitude, whichever is
        higher.
     A15.3.9.3. Minimum Airspeed. The minimum airspeed for low level (less than
     1000‘AGL) navigation is 300 KCAS.
     A15.3.9.4. For night or IMC operation the minimum altitude is 1000 feet above the
     highest obstacle within 5 NM of course unless operating under the conditions of
     paragraph A15.3.10., General Terrain Following (TF) Operations.
     A15.3.9.5. For Air to Surface range operations min altitudes will be determined by
     Range restrictions, AFI 11-214 restrictions, or aircrew minimums, whichever is greater.
     A15.3.9.6. Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) Route/Area Abort Procedures.
     Comply with VFR altitude restrictions, maintain VMC and squawk applicable (IFF/SIF)
     modes and codes. Attempt contact with controlling agency, if required.
     A15.3.9.7. IMC Route/Area Abort Procedures. Immediately climb to, or above, the
     briefed RAA and maintain preplanned ground track. Execute appropriate lost wingman
     procedures if necessary. If deviations from normal route/area procedures are required, or
     if the RAA/MSA is higher than the vertical limits of the route/area, squawk (IFF/SIF)
     emergency. Attempt contact with the appropriate ATC agency for an Instrument Flight
 212                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


       Rules (IFR) clearance. If required to fly in IMC without an IFR clearance, cruise at
       appropriate VFR altitudes until IFR clearance is received.
   A15.3.10. General Terrain Following (TF) Operations.
       A15.3.10.1. The minimum altitude for TF training will be the higher of MTR, MOA, or
       aircrew LASDT qualification, but not lower than 500‘ AGL at night or in IMC.
       A15.3.10.2. An operational LANTIRN system is required to conduct night or day IMC
       low level operations below the MSA. If Low Altitude NVG qualified comply with
       restrictions in para 3.3.8.7. of the basic instruction.
       A15.3.10.3. For training, unarmed TF operations are prohibited.
       A15.3.10.4. Minimum equipment required for TF operations is TF radar, radar altimeter
       (RALT), and E-SCOPE. For IMC TF a functioning A/A and A/G radar is also required.
       For night operations, a usable Navigation/Forward Looking Infrared (NAV/FLIR) HUD
       image is required. NVGs may be used in place of the NAV/FLIR.
       A15.3.10.5. Each crew will confirm by inter-cockpit communication that the TF and
       RALT are on and working properly before descending below the MSA.
       A15.3.10.6. Any maneuvering that will put the aircraft outside of TF limits, negating fly-
       up protection, will be at or above the applicable MSA or RAA.
       A15.3.10.7. Abnormal Operation during IMC TF. Aircrews who experience failure of
       any portion of the TF system or A/A / A/G radar while flying IMC TF will immediately
       climb to (or above) the MSA (or RAA if not within 5NM of course). If the failure(s) can
       be cleared and safe TF regained, TF operations may resume. Otherwise terminate the
       low level portion of the mission.
   A15.3.11. Approaches and Landings.
       A15.3.11.1. The desired touchdown point is 500-1000 feet past the runway threshold for
       a VFR pattern or 500-1000 feet past the Runway Point of Intercept (RPI) for a precision
       approach.
       A15.3.11.2. Landing Restrictions:
          A15.3.11.2.1. Do not land over any raised web barrier (e.g. MA-1A, 61QS11), or
          loose or slack cable (e.g. BAK-12/13/14).
   A15.3.12. NVGs.
       A15.3.12.1. Night BD checks are permitted only when wearing NVGs.
       A15.3.12.2. Aircrew that are NVG Medium Altitude Qualified may fly below the MSA
       while wearing NVGs during low level navigation if using the TF system for terrain
       avoidance. With any failure of the TF system the aircrew will immediately climb to (or
       above) the MSA (or RAA if not within 5NM of course)
A15.4. Instrument Procedures.
   A15.4.1. The F-15 is Approach Category E.
   A15.4.2. Area Navigation. The F-15 INS and EGI are approved for Enroute Area
   Navigation (RNAV); however, RNAV and GPS approaches are not authorized.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                   213


   A15.4.3. Trail Departures.
      A15.4.3.1. Each aircraft/element will accelerate in MIL/AB power until reaching 350
      KCAS. Climb at 350 KCAS until reaching cruise mach/TAS IAW Flight Manual, unless
      otherwise briefed.
      A15.4.3.2. Upon reaching 350 KCAS, the flight leader will set 850 FTIT for PW-100/-
      220 and 900 FTIT for PW-229 unless otherwise briefed.
   A15.4.4. Electronic Attitude Director Indicator (EADI) – F-15E. In IMC the EADI must be
   used as the primary attitude reference by the crewmember flying the aircraft. The F-15E
   HUD is not certified as a Primary Flight Reference (PFR) IAW AFI 11-217V1; therefore, it
   cannot be used as a sole attitude reference.
      A15.4.4.1. The HUD is the primary reference for low level/TF operations. Do not use
      the HUD to recover from an unusual attitude or when executing lost wingman procedures
      except when no other reference is available.
A15.5. Operating Procedures and Restrictions.
   A15.5.1. General. Follow the procedures in this chapter when other than normal
   circumstances occur. These procedures do not supersede flight manual guidance.
   A15.5.2. Aircraft Over-G Procedures.
      A15.5.2.1. Non-OWS equipped aircraft and OWS equipped aircraft whose OWS is not
      operational will terminate the mission and land as soon as practical from a straight-in
      approach.
      A15.5.2.2. Aircraft equipped with an operable OWS system will immediately terminate
      maneuvering and call up the OWS matrix:
      A15.5.2.3. If level "1" (one) is displayed in any column of the matrix except Mass Items
      (MIT), perform a battle damage check. If no abnormalities are noted, the flight lead may
      continue the briefed mission. If a subsequent level "1" or greater over-G occurs,
      terminate the mission, perform a battle damage check, RTB and fly a straight-in
      approach.
      A15.5.2.4. If level "1" (one) or greater is displayed in the MIT column, or level "2" (two)
      or greater is displayed in any column of the matrix, terminate the mission, perform a
      battle damage check, RTB and fly a straight-in approach.
      A15.5.2.5. Document over-Gs (level 1 or greater) in the AFTO Form 781.
   A15.5.3. In-flight Practice of Emergency Procedures.
      A15.5.3.1. A Simulated Emergency Procedure is defined as any procedure that produces
      an effect that closely parallels an actual emergency, such as retarding the throttle to
      simulate the drag equivalent to a flamed out engine.
      A15.5.3.2. Practice aborted takeoffs only in the flight simulator, Cockpit Procedures
      Trainer (CPT), or a static aircraft.
      A15.5.3.3. Simulated in-flight loss of both engines and practice in-flight engine
      shutdown is prohibited unless part of a syllabus for a formal training course such as TPS.

      A15.5.3.4. Emergency Landing Patterns. Include the type of practice emergency pattern
      if appropriate in the gear down call.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                    215


                                        Attachment 16
                             F-16 OPERATING PROCEDURES

A16.1. General Information. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives,
outlines procedures for operation of the F-16 aircraft under most circumstances. It applies to
AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of F-16 aircraft.
Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe,
effective mission accomplishment.
A16.2. Mission Planning.
   A16.2.1. Takeoff and Landing Data.
       A16.2.1.1. Compute a 2,000 foot acceleration check speed anytime the computed takeoff
       roll exceeds 2,500 feet. When the computed takeoff roll is 2,500 feet or less, use the
       actual takeoff distance versus the computed takeoff distance to evaluate aircraft
       performance.
A16.3. Common Mission Guidance.
   A16.3.1. General Requirements and Restrictions.
       A16.3.1.1. (B/D model aircraft) When the rear cockpit is occupied by other than a fully
       qualified F-16 pilot, the stick control switch will be placed in the FWD position.
       A16.3.1.2. Baggage or equipment will not be carried in the avionics bay behind the
       cockpit or in the aft canopy fixed transparency area.
       A16.3.1.3. Baggage or equipment will not be carried in an unoccupied F-16B/D rear
       cockpit.
       A16.3.1.4. Objects will not be placed in or on top of the engine intake.
       A16.3.1.5. Publications, maps and personal items placed in the cockpit will be secured to
       avoid flight control and throttle interference.
       A16.3.1.6. Pilots will ensure the ejection seat survival kit deployment switch is in the
       automatic position.
       A16.3.1.7. The CAT III position of the Stores Configuration Switch will be selected
       when the aircraft is configured with a Category III loading in accordance with aircraft
       technical orders.
       A16.3.1.8. Aircraft will not descend below 5,000 feet AGL during any portion of
       aerobatic maneuvering.
       A16.3.1.9. Flight through wingtip vortices and jet wash should be avoided. If
       unavoidable, the aircraft should be unloaded immediately to approximately 1 G.
       A16.3.1.10. Unless conducting authorized High AOA training, do not attempt to bypass
       flight control limiters to improve performance. Examples are: fuel transfer to alter center
       of gravity or use of the manual pitch override (MPO).
       A16.3.1.11. Unless conducting authorized High AOA training, the minimum airspeed for
       all maneuvering is based upon activation of the low speed warning tone. When the low
216                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


      speed warning tone sounds, the pilot will take immediate action to correct the low speed
      condition.
      A16.3.1.12. The minimum airspeed for low level navigation is 300 KCAS. If conditions
      allow, enough airspeed and altitude should be maintained to allow a zoom and JFS-
      assisted airstart attempt in the event of engine failure.
      A16.3.1.13. Use of Altimeters.
         A16.3.1.13.1. General. For those aircraft so equipped, the radar altimeter will be on
         for all flights. The MSL Floor altitude advisory will be used for those missions that
         are conducive to spatial disorientation (night/IMC), or where minimum altitudes must
         be observed (ACBT floors).
         A16.3.1.13.2. Non-TFR Operations. Set the ALOW function of the radar altimeter
         no lower than the briefed minimum altitude.
      A16.3.1.14. Afterburner Use. Do not use AB below 2,000 pounds total fuel or
      established bingo fuel, whichever is higher, unless required for safety of flight.
      A16.3.1.15. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Analog FLCS F-16s that have ballast installed
      for High AoA sorties are restricted to maneuvering categories of Limited, Restricted, or
      Non-maneuvering when accomplishing Air-to-Air engagements. No maneuvers where
      AoA limits are assaulted will be performed. HARTS maneuvers IAW AFTTP 3-3 are
      allowed. There are no restrictions if ballast has been removed.
  A16.3.2. Ground/Taxi Operations.
      A16.3.2.1. Ice FOD Procedures. The following procedures apply when the conditions in
      the flight manual indicate engine damage due to icing is possible.
      A16.3.2.1. (EDWARDSAFB) Induction Icing Conditions broadcast by EDW WX are
      more stringent than actual flight manual Ice FOD Procedures. Pilots will use Dash 1
      conditions (at a minimum) to initiate F-16 Ice FOD Procedures.
         A16.3.2.1.1. The first aircraft will start 5 minutes early to check for inlet ice
         formation. The pilot will brief the crew chief to look for ice build up on the inlet lip
         and strut heater. Shutdown immediately if icing is visually detected, and notify the
         SOF and the squadron supervision.
         A16.3.2.1.1. (EDWARDSAFB) When Ice FOD conditions exist, F-16 units will
         designate one F-16 to start first in order to determine Ice FOD potential. This check
         may be done by units independently or in coordination with other units (i.e. one check
         is good for all units).
         A16.3.2.1.2. Position ANTI ICE switch to ON prior to engine start.
         A16.3.2.1.3. An ice FOD monitor must be available to monitor the engine inlet for
         ice buildup whenever the aircraft is stopped for an extended period of time (i.e.
         ramp/shelter and EOR). While taxiing, avoid unnecessary stops en-route to EOR. If
         possible, remain at the ramp, or in the shelter until traffic delays are eliminated.
         Avoid standing water and snow or slush accumulations. When pulling into the
         arming area, attempt to stop the aircraft over an area clear of water, ice, or snow.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                   217


         A16.3.2.1.3. (EDWARDSAFB) When Ice FOD conditions exist, pilots will ensure
         crew chiefs are briefed on Ice FOD potential and procedures.
         A16.3.2.1.4. Hold in the arming spot with an ice FOD monitor present until cleared
         for take-off.
         A16.3.2.1.4. (EDWARDSAFB) EOR crews are trained to monitor F-16s for Ice
         FOD but normally can only monitor the jet they are currently inspecting. If multiple
         F-16s are at EOR, F-16 pilots will monitor the intakes of jets adjacent to them for
         potential Ice FOD. After all EOR inspections are complete, EOR crews will also
         monitor intakes when possible. In the case of a single F-16 at EOR, EOR crews will
         remain with the aircraft to monitor the inlet.
         A16.3.2.1.5. Shutdown immediately if icing is visually detected and notify the SOF
         and the squadron supervision. Make an appropriate entry in the aircraft forms. A
         qualified crew chief should accomplish an intake inspection prior to restarting the
         engine.
     A16.3.2.2. Quick Check and Arming. Place hands in view of ground personnel while the
     quick check inspection, arming, or de-arming are in progress. If the intercom system is
     not used during EOR checks, the pilot will establish and maintain visual contact with the
     maintenance team chief or weapons load chief to facilitate the use of visual signals.
     A16.3.2.3. EPU Check. When accomplishing EPU checks at EOR, pilots will ensure
     that maintenance technicians do not approach the aircraft until the EPU check is
     complete. Use a "thumbs up" signal or the intercom to indicate when it is safe.
  A16.3.3. Takeoff.
     A16.3.3.1. Make an afterburner takeoff anytime the computed MIL power takeoff roll
     exceeds 50 percent of the available runway.
     A16.3.3.2. When centerline stores are carried, start the takeoff roll beyond a raised
     approach end cable, unless runway length, runway conditions (wet/icy), winds, gross
     weight or cable availability dictate otherwise. Aircraft configured with a centerline fuel
     tank may takeoff across approach end BAK-12 arrestment cables which are tied down
     with an 8-point system.
     A16.3.3.3. For single ship takeoffs, aircraft will steer toward the center of the runway.
     A16.3.3.4. To takeoff in formation, aircraft must be within 2,500 pounds gross weight of
     each other and have the same type engine (PW-220 vs. PW-220, etc.).
  A16.3.4. Overhead Traffic Patterns.
     A16.3.4.1. Tactical entry to the overhead traffic pattern is permitted if the following
     conditions are met:
         A16.3.4.1.1. Published overhead pattern altitude and airspeed will be used.
         A16.3.4.1.2. Specific procedures will be developed locally and coordinated with
         appropriate air traffic control agencies.
         A16.3.4.1.3. Four aircraft are the maximum permitted. Aircraft (or elements) more
         than 6,000 feet in trail will be considered a separate flight.
218                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


         A16.3.4.1.4. Regardless of the formation flown, no aircraft should be offset from the
         runway in the direction of the break. The intent is to avoid requiring a tighter than
         normal turn to arrive on normal downwind.
         A16.3.4.1.5. Normal downwind, base turn positions, and spacing will be flown.
  A16.3.5. Functional Check Flights (FCF). If an FCF is flown for engine-related causes, a
  maximum afterburner takeoff will be performed to maximize climb capability to obtain an
  immediate SFO high key position. A ceiling, if present, must be confirmed to be at least 500
  feet above computed high key altitude. In all cases, departure-field weather must permit an
  immediate overhead SFO pattern where VMC can be maintained throughout the pattern. All
  engine-related FCF checks must be accomplished within gliding range of a suitable landing
  field and weather must permit a VMC descent to high key and VMC SFO at that airfield.
  Pilots flying engine-related FCFs will verify that these requirements can be met prior to
  takeoff.
      A16.3.5.1. If the ceiling directly over the departure field is lower than 500 above the
      computed high key altitude, the following alternate procedures are authorized. A pre-
      planned and coordinated position and altitude (alternate high key) that will allow for an
      immediate VMC SFO will be determined prior to takeoff. The weather at the alternate
      high key must have a ceiling no lower than 500 feet above the computed altitude
      required, the field must be visible from this position, and the pilot must be able to
      maintain VMC throughout the SFO. These procedures must be coordinated and
      published locally, and pilots must be able to practice SFOs from the alternate high key
      position.
  A16.3.6. Advanced Handling Characteristics. Minimum altitude for the Horn Awareness
  and Recovery Series (HARTS), Confidence Maneuvers, and Advanced Handling Maneuvers
  is 10,000 feet AGL. Reference the applicable exercises or maneuvers for minimum and
  recommended entry altitudes. Procedures for these maneuvers are found in AFTPP 3-3.F-16.
  HARTS maneuvers will be flown in CAT-1 configured aircraft only.
  A16.3.7. NVG Lighting Restrictions. The use of the ―WING/TAIL – OFF‖ simultaneously
  with ―COVERT-FORM‖ or ―COVERT-ALL‖ is a prohibited external lighting configuration
  for NVG operations.
  A16.3.8. Air-to-Air Operations.
      A16.3.8.1. Maneuvering Limitations.
         A16.3.8.1.1. Minimum airspeed during offensive or defensive maneuvering below
         5,000 ft AGL is 350 KCAS.
         A16.3.8.1.2. All CAT I configurations are authorized for unlimited maneuvering, as
         defined by AFI 11-214. CAT III configured aircraft must maintain 200 KCAS
         minimum during maneuvering.
      A16.3.8.2. Simulated Gun Employment. The gun is considered SAFE and simulated gun
      employment is authorized if the following conditions are met:
         A16.3.8.2.1. Preflight.     Accomplished IAW DASH-34 Cold Gun (SAFE)
         Procedures.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                    219


         A16.3.8.2.2. In-Flight. A trigger check must be performed with the Master Arm
         switch in SIMULATE and the aircraft pointed away from other aircraft and inhabited
         areas. If HUD symbology reads "ARM" or SMS/MFD symbology reads "RDY," do
         not depress the trigger or continue with simulated weapons employment. Regardless
         of Master Arm switch position, do not perform a trigger check with a "hot" gun.
  A16.3.9. Air-to-Surface.
     A16.3.9.1. Off-Range Attacks. With expendable stores (bombs, external fuel tanks,
     TERs carted at the pylon, etc.) loaded on the aircraft, simulated weapons will be loaded
     (zero quantity) in the SMS/MFD only on empty or uncarted/unexpendable stations.
     EXCEPTION: When loaded, captive Maverick and HARM missiles may be selected.
     The Master Arm switch will be confirmed in OFF or SIMULATE prior to the first attack.
     A16.3.9.2. Pop-Up Attacks. Abort pop-up attacks if airspeed decreases below 350 KCAS
     (300 KCAS above 10,000 feet AGL).
     A16.3.9.3. Night Weapons Delivery/Range Operations.
         A16.3.9.3.1. Compute a MSA for the entire bombing pattern.
         A16.3.9.3.2. Do not exceed 135 degrees of bank when returning to the low altitude
         structure following practice or actual night weapons deliveries.
     A16.3.9.4. LANTIRN Weapons Delivery/Range Operations.
         A16.3.9.4.1. If CARA ALOW and/or MSL Floor altitude advisory warnings are used
         for altitude cues on medium altitude weapons deliveries, care must be taken to reset
         them as appropriate when descending into the low-level structure.
         A16.3.9.4.2. The LANTIRN Attitude Advisory Function (LAAF) must be
         operational and set at the IP to TGT run-in MSA plus 5,000 feet for all night, self-
         designated laser-guided bomb (LGB) Loft deliveries.
         A16.3.9.4.3. The pilot will perform no duties (i.e., adjusting designation cursor on
         targeting pod) other than maintaining aircraft control from the initial pull-up during
         the performance of a night weapons delivery. During safe escape maneuver or during
         a night climbing delivery which employs a descent back to low altitude, pilots will
         focus solely on aircraft control until the aircraft is recovered back within TFR limits
         and TFR indications are adequate to continue safe low altitude operations.
     A16.3.9.5. Strafe Procedures. To prevent accidental gun firing, pilots will not select
     strafe mode until just prior to roll-in and will deselect strafe mode after establishing safe
     recovery parameters from each pass.
  A16.3.10. LANTIRN Operations.
     A16.3.10.1. Minimum Altitude. The minimum altitude for LANTIRN training will be
     the higher of VR/IR/MOA minimum altitude, or pilot minimum altitude as certified by
     the unit commander.
     A16.3.10.2. Vision Restriction Device (VRD) Restrictions:
         A16.3.10.2.1. VRDs will only be worn while conducting LANTIRN low-level
         training and LANTIRN weapon deliveries.
220                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


         A16.3.10.2.2. When a VRD is in use, a safety observer must be present. A safety
         observer is defined as a crewmember qualified in that aircraft in the rear cockpit of a
         two-place aircraft or another aircraft flying in the chase position. The chase aircraft
         must maintain continuous visual contact and have two-way radio communication
         between aircraft.
         A16.3.10.2.3. When a VRD is in use with the safety observer in the rear cockpit,
         pilots are restricted to the same altitude and procedures they are cleared to for night
         LANTIRN operations.
      A16.3.10.3. Operational Procedures. All procedures in AFI 11-214 apply in addition to
      the following:
         A16.3.10.3.1. Terrain following is prohibited after any alignment other than a full
         performance INS ground alignment, or extended interrupted alignment with a
         flashing RDY/ALIGN (status 10 or better) displayed.
         A16.3.10.3.2. TFR/LANTIRN systems will be in-flight checked using flight manual
         procedures on every flight involving TFR/LANTIRN operations.
         A16.3.10.3.3. Pilots must ensure all LANTIRN systems are functioning properly
         prior to sustained low-level operations. If any feature that is critical to overall system
         performance - Flight Control System (FLCS), INS, Combined Altitude Radar
         Altimeter (CARA) - is questionable or disabled, the checks and/or LANTIRN portion
         of the mission will be discontinued. When in formation, all pilots will confirm by
         radio call that the TFR and radar altimeter are on and working properly before
         descending below the MSA; "(Call Sign), RALT ON, TFR ON."
         A16.3.10.3.4. For TFR/LANTIRN operations, the ALOW feature of the CARA will
         be on and set no lower than 90 percent of the set clearance plane (SCP). The CARA
         may be placed to standby or off only during air refueling operations. Pilots need to
         ensure the CARA is tracking properly when descending through 4,500 feet AGL.
         A16.3.10.3.5. Minimum airspeed for TFR navigation is 400 KCAS.
         A16.3.10.3.6. During descent, pilots will accomplish a 1,000 foot Set Clearance
         Plane (SCP) level off prior to selecting a lower SCP.
         A16.3.10.3.7. Pilots will not conduct LANTIRN operations in IMC below the MSA,
         and must abide by FLIP weather minimums while on military training routes.
      A16.3.10.4. Abnormal Operation:
         A16.3.10.4.1. Pilots who experience failure of the terrain following system or failure
         of the LANTIRN HUD/FLIR imagery system while flying low-level missions will
         immediately climb to the MSA or above. The mission may be continued at the MSA
         within the low-level structure provided the aircraft position is known. If aircraft
         position cannot be positively determined, pilots will terminate that portion of the
         mission and execute route abort procedures.
         A16.3.10.4.2. If the TFR/LANTIRN system fails prior to route entry, pilots may still
         enter the route and continue the mission at the MSA, provided the above provisions
         are met.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                     221


          A16.3.10.4.3. Pilots will honor all system fly-ups and will not continue low-level
          operations below the MSA without TFR protection. The following procedures will
          be used at the first indication of a fly-up (pilots need only accomplish sufficient steps
          of the fly-up procedure to assure terrain clearance or until the fly-up
          terminates/clears):
          A16.3.10.4.4. Allow the fly-up to develop. CAUTION: If an automatic fly-up is not
          initiated by the system and aural or visual pull-up warnings are present, pilots will
          manually initiate a fly-up and comply with these procedures.
          A16.3.10.4.5. Throttle - As required. CAUTION: Military Power may be required
          to maintain a safe airspeed. Do not hesitate to use AB if required.
          A16.3.10.4.6. When terrain clearance ensured, Paddle Switch - Depress and release.
          CAUTION: Holding the paddle switch depressed inhibits fly-up commands to the
          FLCS.
      A16.3.10.5. If the system does not reset:
          A16.3.10.5.1. Climb to MSA. CAUTION: Using climb angles greater than 20
          degrees can result in rapid airspeed bleed off. The use of AB and/or steep climb
          angles can result in spatial disorientation.
          A16.3.10.5.2. Level off at or above MSA and refer to checklist (if required).
          A16.3.10.5.3. If the malfunction can be reset, pilots may continue TFR operations.
   A16.3.11. High AoA. F-16 Flight Manual prohibited maneuvers of "intentional departures,
   not recovering at activation of low-speed horn, rudder-assisted rolls, and expanded g-limits"
   are allowed for test and safety review board approved flight tests and when used during
   approved High-AOA training programs. This flight manual deviation has been approved by
   HQ AFMC/A3 per AFMC waiver 09-166.
A16.4. Instrument Procedures.
   A16.4.1. The F-16 is approach category E.
   A16.4.2. The F-16 INS/GPS and EGI are approved for enroute Area Navigation (RNAV).
   Neither RNAV nor GPS approaches are authorized.
   A16.4.3. Use of the Heads Up Display (HUD). Regardless of Block or OFP, do not use the
   HUD to recover from an unusual attitude or while executing lost wingman procedures except
   when no other reference is available. The HUD in F-16 Block 25/30/32 aircraft and Block
   40/50 aircraft with Operational Flight Program (OFP) 40T5/50T4 (TV Code 117/115) and
   later OFPs may be used as a primary flight reference in night/IMC conditions. The HUD in
   all other F-16 Blocks and OFPs may be used as an additional instrument reference, but not
   the sole reference, in night/IMC conditions.
A16.5. Operating Procedures and Restrictions.
   A16.5.1. Takeoff Aborts. If aborting above 120 KCAS, suspect hot brakes. Taxi the aircraft
   to the designated hot brake area and follow hot brake procedures. During any abort, the
   tailhook should be lowered if there is any doubt about the ability to stop on the remaining
   runway.
222                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


  A16.5.2. In-flight Practice of Emergency Procedures.
      A16.5.2.1. Aborted Takeoff Practice. All practice and/or training related to aborted
      takeoffs will be accomplished in the flight simulator, Cockpit Familiarization Trainer
      (CFT) or (if trainer unavailable) a static aircraft.
      A16.5.2.2. Practice in-flight engine shutdown is prohibited unless conducting authorized
      airstart training.
      A16.5.2.3. SFO‘s will not be performed to a touch and go or full stop landing if aircraft
      gross weight exceeds 23,000 lbs. (A/B model) or 25,000 lbs. (C/D model).
  A16.5.3. (Added-EDWARDSAFB) Lakebed landings. Full stop lakebed landings on
  Rogers Dry Lakebed at Edwards AFB are authorized for F-16 aircraft (emergency recoveries,
  crosswinds limitations, main runway closures). Lakebed proficiency landings are authorized
  but require Squadron Supervisor approval. Notify maintenance prior to conducting a lakebed
  proficiency landing. After landing, an F-16 may continue taxiing but must leave the throttle
  in idle to minimize the potential for FOD ingestion. Select SEC to increase idle thrust if
  necessary. Pilots will shut down the engine immediately if the aircraft comes to a stop on the
  lakebed, and contact maintenance for tow support.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                        223

                                        Attachment 18
                             T-38 OPERATING PROCEDURES

A18.1. General Information. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives,
outlines procedures for operation of the T-38 aircraft under most circumstances. It applies to
AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of all T-38 series aircraft.
Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe,
effective mission accomplishment.
A18.2. Mission Planning.
   A18.2.1. Takeoff Requirements.
       A18.2.1.1. Compute takeoff and landing data for all flights. MAJCOM approved tab
       data may be used when available. Also, 558th ASCG T-38C (PMP) and T-38C (non-
       PMP) TOLD calculators may be used.
       A18.2.1.2. Operations without a BAK-15. Use Refusal Speed (RS) - Both Engines
       Operating (RS-BEO) as Go/No-Go speed when Decision Speed (DS) is less than RS-
       BEO.
          A18.2.1.2.1. When DS is greater than RS-BEO, the OG/CC (or designated
          representative) approval is required. Use Refusal Speed Engine Failure (RS-EF) as
          the Go/No-Go speed. (Note: Aborts for other than engine failure (e.g., generator
          lights, fire lights, etc.) initiated between RS-BEO and RS-EF may result in
          overrunning the runway surface.)
          A18.2.1.2.2. When DS is greater than RS-EF takeoffs are not authorized.
       A18.2.1.3. Operations with a BAK-15. Use Refusal Speed - Engine Failure (RS-EF) as
       Go/No-Go speed when DS is less than or equal to RS-EF. (Note: Aborts for other than
       engine failure (e.g., generator lights, fire lights, etc.) initiated between RS-BEO and RS-
       EF may result in barrier engagement.)
          A18.2.1.3.1. When DS is greater than RS-EF and less than Takeoff Speed (TOS),
          takeoffs are allowed with OG/CC (or designated representative) approval. Use TOS
          as Go/No-Go speed with a remotely controlled BAK-15. With a non-remotely
          controlled BAK-15 in the raised position use Single Engine Takeoff Speed (SETOS)
          as Go/No-Go speed.
          A18.2.1.3.2. When DS is greater than or equal to TOS, or DS & SETOS cannot be
          validated, takeoffs are not authorized unless specific procedures for operational
          requirements are developed and approved by the OG/CC. (Note: For some extreme
          combinations of temperature and pressure altitude, the performance charts will not
          yield a valid DS or SETOS. This occurs on the DS chart where the curves on the
          gross weight plot do not extend far enough upwards and on the SETOS chart where
          the gross weight plot is labeled "SINGLE ENGINE TAKEOFFS NOT POSSIBLE.")
A18.3. Common Mission Guidance.
   A18.3.1. General Requirements and Restrictions.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                     225


      A18.3.1.1. Pilots must take into consideration deviations from standard day temperatures
      at altitude when planning flights above FL300. The engine compressor stall/flameout
      susceptibility area chart will be consulted and flight will not be planned into the black
      striped area.
   A18.3.2. Ground/Taxi Operations.
      A18.3.2.1. Cold Weather Start.
          A18.3.2.1.1. In the event of T-38C EED oil pressure indicator erroneously latching
          red immediately after a battery start in cold weather (oil pressure in excess of 55 psi),
          pilots are authorized to continue operating engines until oil pressure returns to within
          ops limits and then clear the latched oil pressure indication by, with both engines at
          IDLE, monitoring engine operation via the EED Repeater in the MFD while
          performing EED IBIT as detailed in the aircraft flight manual.
   A18.3.3. Air-to-Air Operations.
      A18.3.3.1. Maneuvering Limitations.
          A18.3.3.1.1. Minimum airspeed during offensive or defensive air-to-air maneuvering
          below 5,000 ft AGL is 350 KIAS.
          A18.3.3.1.2. Minimum maneuvering airspeed during ACBT is 150 KIAS.
   A18.3.4. Air-to-Surface.
      A18.3.4.1. Off-Range Attacks. With expendable ordnance loaded on the aircraft,
      simulated weapons employment off range is permitted. However, the master arm must
      remain safe, and the pickle button or trigger will not be used.
      A18.3.4.2. Popup Attacks. Abort pop-up attacks if airspeed decreases below 300 KIAS.
      A18.3.4.3. Night Weapons Delivery and Range Operations. Night weapons delivery and
      range operations are prohibited.

                                         Attachment 19
                             KC10 OPERATING PROCEDURES

A19.1. General Information. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives,
outlines procedures for operation of the KC-10 aircraft under most circumstances. It applies to
AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of all KC-10 aircraft.
Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe,
effective mission accomplishment.
A19.2. Common Mission Guidance.
   A19.2.1. Intersection Takeoffs. Intersection takeoffs are authorized if available runway
   length meets or exceeds the aircraft minimum runway length from table 2.1.
   A19.2.2. Landing Guidance. The following landing limitations apply to both touch-and-go
   and full stop landings:
       A19.2.2.1. All pilots will plan to land on centerline within the touchdown zone.
       A19.2.2.2. All touchdowns will be at a gross weight and at a point and speed that will
       permit a safe, full stop landing in the remaining runway. If this is not possible, initiate a
       go-around.
       A19.2.2.3. The maximum crosswind component for takeoff and full stop landings is 31
       knots or flight manual limits, whichever is less.
       A19.2.2.4. Transition, to include approaches and touch-and-go landings, can be
       conducted up to Flight Manual gross weight limits.
       A19.2.2.5. Do not land on approach end arresting cables (does not include recessed
       cables). If the aircraft lands before the cable, the crew should contact the tower to have
       the cable inspected. Do not takeoff or land over an approach end cable that has been
       reported slack, loose, or improperly rigged by NOTAMs, ATIS, or ATC.
       A19.2.2.6. Perform touch-and-go landings IAW this instruction and the applicable flight
       manual.
       A19.2.2.7. Before final approach, the instructor pilot or qualified Mission Pilot (MP) will
       brief touch-and-go landing considerations with the other appropriate aircrew members.
       On successive approaches, if the briefing remains the same and there are no questions,
       the briefing need not be repeated and the pilot may simply state, ―Briefing remains the
       same.‖
       A19.2.2.8. Do not accomplish touch-and-go landings on slush-covered runways.
       A19.2.2.9. The center gear will be extended for touch-and-go landings.
       A19.2.2.10. A minimum of 9 wheel brakes must be operational.                Antiskid on all
       operational wheel brakes must be functioning normally.
A19.3. Instrument Procedures. The KC-10 is approach category D, unless gross weight
dictates category E.
A19.4. Operating Procedures and Restrictions.

  A19.4.1. Prohibited Maneuvers. This section adds aircraft limitations and restrictions to
  those already specified in flight manuals and applies to all aircrew. Engine out training is
  covered by AFI 11-2FTV3, Table 5.1. The following maneuvers are prohibited unless on an
  approved test plan:
      A19.4.1.1. Stalls.
      A19.4.1.2. Dutch Roll.
      A19.4.1.3. Emergency descents.
      A19.4.1.4. Unusual attitudes.
  A19.4.2. Air Refueling (AR) Limitations.
      A19.4.2.1. Do not accomplish AR operations when:
         A19.4.2.1.1. Conditions are encountered which, in the opinion of either aircraft
         commander or the boom operator, result in marginal control of either the aircraft or
         the boom.
         A19.4.2.1.2. Either the tanker or the receiver has less than the full number of engines
         operating (except B-52).
         A19.4.2.1.3. The tanker aircraft is unable to retract the landing gear.
      A19.4.2.2. Tanker Autopilot. Aircrews will notify and receive acknowledgement from
      the receiver pilot any time any axis of the autopilot is not being used.
      A19.4.2.3. AR without tanker disconnect capability. AR without tanker disconnect
      capability means the boom operator cannot trigger an immediate disconnect using either
      the normal disconnect system or the independent disconnect system (IDS). AR (tanker or
      receiver) will not be conducted after a known loss of tanker disconnect capability.
      Exceptions to the restrictions are:
         A19.4.2.3.1. During emergency fuel situations.
         A19.4.2.3.2. When     necessary          to     complete       receiver     over-water
         deployment/redeployment.
      A19.4.2.4. Manual boom latching (MBL), emergency boom latching (EBL) and override
      boom latching (OBL). The MBL, EBL and OBL with IDS system operative may be
      accomplished without restrictions. To complete training or evaluation in MBL, EBL and
      OBL procedures without IDS, the following conditions must be met.
         A19.4.2.4.1. An AR instructor pilot must be at a set of controls during the receiver
         contacts (if other than fighter type).
         A19.4.2.4.2. Contacts will be limited to the minimum required.
         A19.4.2.4.3. The receiver aircraft AR system must be fully operable.
         A19.4.2.4.4. Boom operator and receiver pilot must coordinate all actions as required
         by applicable directives and checklists when making contacts during the situations
         listed above.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                    229


     A19.4.2.5. Practice Emergency Separations. Prior to the actual accomplishment of a
     practice emergency separation, coordination between the tanker pilot, boom operator and
     the receiver pilot is mandatory. Coordination must include when the separation will
     occur and who will give the command of execution. Tanker pilot coordination may be
     accomplished over interphone with the boom operator. Practice emergency separations
     may be accomplished with passengers onboard. Ensure all passengers are seated with
     seat belts fastened. Prior to a practice emergency separation from the contact position
     when conducting AR behind a KC135, a disconnect capability must have been previously
     determined by a boom operator initiated disconnect.
     A19.4.2.6. Limits Demonstration. Prior to a limits demonstration, when conducting AR
     behind a KC135, a disconnect capability must have been previously determined by a
     boom operator initiated disconnect.
     A19.4.2.7. Receiver AR Training. A qualified receiver IP will conduct training. The
     receiver pilot must inform and obtain acknowledgement from the tanker pilot and boom
     operator when an unqualified receiver pilot is receiving AR training. During this time, a
     boom operator qualified for the applicable category receiver must operate the boom
     controls, and if the tanker autopilot is off, the tanker must be flown by a pilot current and
     qualified in tanker AR.
     A19.4.2.8. All personnel will be strapped in a crew position during either receiver or
     tanker AR operations unless a test plan requires personnel to be unrestrained.
     A19.4.2.9. Altitude. A/R operations are normally conducted above 12,000 feet MSL, or
     10,000 feet AGL, whichever is higher. A/R operations based at or above 12,000 feet
     MSL which momentarily fall below 10,000 feet AGL, but not lower than 5,000 feet
     AGL, due to overflight of mountain ridges, peaks, etc., are authorized. A/R operations in
     support of C-130 receivers at the C-130's optimum refueling altitude, but no lower than
     5,000 feet AGL are authorized. A/R performed below those altitudes will only be on an
     approved test plan or for other operational considerations approved by the OG/CC.
     Except as noted above, A/R operations below 10,000 feet AGL is considered Low
     Altitude Air Refueling (LAAR) and must comply with the following:
        A19.4.2.9.1. A knowledgeable safety observer will be used.
        A19.4.2.9.2. Perform during day, under VFR conditions.
        A19.4.2.9.3. Minimum altitude is 3,000 feet above the highest obstacle or terrain
        within 4 NM of course centerline.
        A19.4.2.9.4. Forecast, reported, or observed winds less than or equal to 27 knots.
        A19.4.2.9.5. Less than forecast, reported or observed moderate turbulence.
        A19.4.2.9.6. Over flat and rolling terrain or a minimum of 10 NM from land over
        contiguous water.
        A19.4.2.9.7. Flight manual restrictions for low altitude operations will be complied
        with.
  A19.4.3. Cargo Loading Procedures. The KC10 cargo loading will only be performed by a
  KC10 boom operator that was previously fully cargo qualified in AMC and has operational
230                             AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


  cargo loading experience. This restriction does not apply to crew chiefs during aircraft
  reconfiguration.

                                         Attachment 20
                              U-2 OPERATING PROCEDURES

A20.1. General Information. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives,
outlines procedures for operation of the U-2 aircraft under most circumstances. It applies to both
Air Force and Contractor aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of all U-
2 aircraft. Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they
enhance safe, effective mission accomplishment.
A20.2. Mission Planning.
   A20.2.1. Flight Logs.
       A20.2.1.1. Flight logs generated using the approved mission planning software ―Green
       Card‖ are authorized.
   A20.2.2. Minimum Oxygen Requirements.
       A20.2.2.1. T.O. U-2S-1 minimum oxygen requirements may be waived by the OG/CC
       for a short ferry flight or during mission unique situations. This waiver will be
       documented and attached to the flight mission paperwork.
A20.3. Common Mission Guidance.
   A20.3.1. Specific Maneuvers.
       A20.3.1.1. Approach and Landings. Conduct multiple patterns, touch and go landings,
       and simulated emergency patterns only when a qualified instructor pilot is in the aircraft
       or occupying the mobile vehicle. A qualified SOF/FSS must be in the mobile and in a
       position to monitor the pattern and landing. (Note: An ACC qualified mobile meets the
       requirements of this paragraph.)
       A20.3.1.2. Do not intentionally perform touch and go landings or practice emergency
       patterns with Primary Mission Equipment (PME) on board.
       A20.3.1.3. All AFMC and Contractor U-2 pilots are authorized to perform SFOs to a
       touch and go or full stop.
       A20.3.1.4. All AFMC and Contractor U-2 pilots are authorized to perform touch and go
       landings at any military airfield in the local training area, to include Beale AFB,
       consistent with the above mobile requirement.
   A20.3.2. Supervisory Requirements.
       A20.3.2.1. A qualified SOF or Flight Safety Supervisor (FSS) will monitor all initial
       takeoffs and full stop landings. The control room will monitor every test sortie flown and
       a SOF or Flight Safety Supervisor (FSS) from the mobile vehicle will monitor every take-
       off, approach, and recovery. Additional information about the SOF and FSS program is
       contained in Det 2, WR-ALC sup to AFMCI 11-201.
   A20.3.3. Personal GPS Units (PGUs).
 232                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


       A20.3.3.1. Aircrew members will not use PGUs for routine en-route navigation. Follow
       PGU policy in AFI 11-202, Volume 3. (Note: PGUs carried by U-2 pilots are used for
       emergency and situational awareness use only)
A20.4. Instrument Procedures.
   A20.4.1. The U-2 is approach category B.
   A20.4.2. Instrument evaluations will not routinely be conducted in the U-2.
A20.5. Operating Procedures and Restrictions.
   A20.5.1. Weather Restrictions.
       A20.5.1.1. Operations during high winds result in an increased risk, primarily caused by
       higher possibility of crosswind problems, windshear, and turbulence. The following
       wind limits will be used when determining go-no go weather.
       A20.5.1.2. Maximum forecast wind, to include gust effects, for launch is 30 knots. Once
       airborne, a recall should be initiated if the forecast wind (gust) exceeds 35 knots.
       Maximum wind for actual landing is not specified, however, consideration should be
       given to the crosswind component (15 knots, maximum), gust factors, and the aircraft
       tow limit of 40 knots. Note: Sorties may launch if the landing is planned for one hour
       prior to the effective time of the out of limit wind forecast. Planned landings one hour
       after the effective time are not recommended. The OG/CC may waive these wind
       restrictions dependent on mission priorities.
       A20.5.1.3. Takeoff. Maximum tail wind for initial takeoff is 10 knots.
       A20.5.1.4. Touch and Go's. When flying touch and go‘s: the maximum crosswind
       component limit is 12 knots and a maximum tail wind component is 5 knots.
   A20.5.2. Functional Check Flight (FCF).
       A20.5.2.1. Initial FCF/ACF weather minimums are a 5000 foot ceiling, with 5 miles
       visibility. This limit may be waived, by the 412 OG/CC for USAF pilots and by
       AFMC/A3V for contractor pilots, to the minimums specified in chapter 3 of this
       instruction. Additionally, weather should allow continuous visual contact with the ground
       sufficient to allow a VMC recovery to either the primary airport or emergency alternates.
       A20.5.2.2. Subsequent ACF and FCF minimums: 3000 foot ceiling and 3 miles
       visibility. This limit may be waived by the OG/CC to the minimums specified in chapter
       3 of this instruction.
   A20.5.3. Weather Minimums.
       A20.5.3.1. Minimum weather required for engineering support flights, if not otherwise
       specified, is 1500 and 3 miles visibility or as outlined in the test plan, whichever is more
       restrictive. This minimum may be waived by the OG/CC but will not deviate from the
       specifics of the approved test plan and safety review board recommendations.
       A20.5.3.2. Operational, Training and Delivery flights will follow command weather
       minimums.
   A20.5.4. Crew Rest Requirements.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                   233


     A20.5.4.1. Fatigue associated with flights in pressure suits and at high cabin altitudes is
     very insidious and accelerated by less than ideal crew rest prior to flight. The following
     restrictions apply to high altitude pressure suit flights:
     A20.5.4.2. Pressure suit flying in excess of 6.5 hours, in a 24-hour period requires 18
     hours recovery time between high flight landing and any subsequent takeoff.
     A20.5.4.3. No more than two pressure suit flights allowed in a 12-hour period or three
     total sorties allowed in a 24-hour period. (A sortie includes an engine start, take off, and
     engine shutdown).
     A20.5.4.4. No more than 13 flying hours in a 48 hour period.
     A20.5.4.5. Maximum high altitude pressure suit sortie hours in any seven-day period is
     25 hours.
     A20.5.4.6. Crew duty day for pressure suit flying is 10 hours. The OG/CC, GFR,
     operations officer, or LMAC Chief Pilot may waive this to 12 hours, with the consent of
     the pilot flying. Waivers to 12 hours for any night flight will be approved by the 412
     OG/CC for USAF pilots and by AFMC/A3V for contractor pilots, but only under extreme
     circumstances. For flights requiring duty periods greater than 12 hours, MAJCOM/DO
     approval is required. Document all waiver action in the remarks section of the flight
     authorization.
  A20.5.5. Pressure Suit Requirements.
     A20.5.5.1. A full pressure suit will be worn for all high flights (flights above FL 450)
     and crewmembers will pre-breath 100 percent oxygen for a minimum of one hour prior to
     takeoff.

                           UH/TH-1 OPERATING PROCEDURES

A21.1. General Information. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives,
outlines procedures for operation of the UH/TH-1 aircraft under most circumstances. It applies
to both Air Force and Contractor AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with
operation of all UH/TH-1 aircraft. Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be
accomplished if they enhance safe, effective mission accomplishment.
A21.2. Mission Planning.
   A21.2.1. Minimum Crew Requirements. Minimum crew requirements are established by
   T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1 and T.O. 1H-1(T)H-1. In addition to flight manual requirements, Table
   A21.1 specifies minimum crew requirements for missions accomplished within AFMC.
   Flight engineers add significantly to the safety and efficiency of all helicopter missions and
   should be used to the maximum extent possible. On single pilot missions, additional aircrew
   or passengers may sit in the left front seat when not required in the cargo compartment.

1. An instructor pilot must be designated on the flight orders and at a set of controls.
2. Single pilot landing at prepared sites and on ranges is permitted provided a minimum of 300
feet rotor disk clearance is provided. Landings may be made to areas that provide a minimum of
75 feet rotor disk clearance (from each blade tip) with a pilot and a co-pilot/FE. If landing to
areas that do not meet these requirements, minimum crew is a pilot, co-pilot, and flight engineer.
3. Training flights accomplished as a part of an upgrade (to copilot, aircraft commander or
instructor) will have a flight engineer.
4. Mission profile and passenger personal requirements must be carefully considered prior to
flying single pilot. Cabin doors will be closed when flying single pilot with passengers.
5. Operations permitted with Co-Pilot / FE if jump master is on intercom and is not jumping.
6. Passengers will not be on the aircraft when practice emergency procedures are flown.

   A21.2.3. Weight and Balance.
       A21.2.3.1. Weight and Balance will be computed IAW T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1, T.O. 1H-
       1(T)H-1, T.O. 1H-1(U)N-5, and T.O.1 -1B-50.
       A21.2.3.2. Weight and Balance computations will be accomplished in handwritten form
       or by use of the current Automated Weight and Balance System (AWBS). When
       computing weight and balance, the ―Transport‖ side of the form F will be used. Weight
       and Balance is normally computed by the flight engineer but can be computed by any
       qualified crewmember. The original form F will be signed by the crewmember that
       completed all computations and by the aircraft commander. The crewmember
       accomplishing the weight and balance form F will make a copy of the original to be
       carried on board the aircraft and the original form F will be filed with the operations desk
       or, when off station, the base operations section prior to crew step.
   A21.2.4. Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD)
       A21.2.4.1. Whenever possible, TOLD should be completed prior to the aircrew briefing
       and re-computed in flight as applicable to mission profile. A standardized TOLD/Lineup
       card will be used, as determined by the AFMC UH-1 Command Chief Pilot and
       maintained in the applicable organization‘s in-flight guide.
       A21.2.4.2. Power Requirements. The following criteria apply when flight planning and /
       or accomplishing test or training missions. Exception: due to the unique ability to
       instantaneously release the water or jettison the fire bucket, the following power
       requirements do not apply to fire bucket operations.
          A21.2.4.2.1. Clear escape route: power for intended hover +5%.
          A21.2.4.2.2. Restricted escape route: Out of Ground Effect (OGE) hover power +5%.
   A21.2.5. Non-standard checklist exception.
       A21.2.5.1. Copies of the Before Takeoff, Before Landing, Hoist Operator‘s Before
       Pickup, and Hoist Operator‘s After Pickup checklists may be posted in the cabin and used
       by the aircrew at the discretion of the flight commander. Accuracy of these extracts must
       be maintained and checked prior to each use.
A21.3. Common Mission Guidance.
   A21.3.1. Night Vision Goggle (NVG) Operations. Use of NVGs during takeoffs, landings,
   and hover operations is authorized. The minimum enroute cruise altitude while flying with
   NVG‘s is 300 feet. Also see the requirements of paragraph A21.5.9.1.

   500 feet above the highest obstacle, within five nautical miles of course centerline.
A21.4. Instrument Procedures.
   A21.4.1. UH/TH-1 aircraft are flown under Approach Category A. Prior to departing from
   an airfield with marginal weather conditions, or if IMC flight is expected, the aircraft
   commander will complete an instrument cockpit check and brief the appropriate instrument
   approach for emergency IFR return.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                    237


   A21.4.2. Any crewmember seeing deviations greater than 10 degrees of heading, 10 knots of
   airspeed, or 100 feet of altitude will inform the pilot flying. Deviations from prescribed
   procedures for the approach being flown will also be announced.
   A21.4.3. Mandatory altitude calls for the pilot not flying / flight engineer during non-
   precision approaches:
      A21.4.3.1. ―One hundred feet above minimum descent altitude‖ (MDA).
      A21.4.3.2. ―Minimums‖ at MDA.
      A21.4.3.3. ―Runway in sight.‖ Call when the runway environment is in sight. Do not call
      too soon when obstructions to vision (such as fog, haze, low stratus clouds, etc.) are
      present.
      A21.4.3.4. ―Go-around.‖ Call at missed approach point if the runway environment is not
      in sight.
   A21.4.4. Mandatory altitude calls for the pilot not flying / flight engineer during precision
   approaches:
      A21.4.4.1. ―One hundred feet above decision height‖ (DH).
      A21.4.4.2. ―Land.‖ Call at decision height if the runway environment is in sight and the
      aircraft is in a position for a normal landing.
      A21.4.4.3. ―Go-around.‖ Call at decision height if the runway environment is not in sight
      or if the aircraft is not in a position for a normal landing.
   A21.4.5. Mandatory calls for the pilot not flying / flight engineer during climb out/descent:
      A21.4.5.1. ―Five hundred feet below/above assigned altitude‖ and ―one hundred feet
      below/ above assigned altitude.‖
      A21.4.5.2. ―Five hundred feet above/below initial approach fix altitude or holding
      altitude‖ and ―one hundred feet above/below initial approach fix altitude or holding
      altitude.‖
A21.5. Operating Procedures and Restrictions.
   A21.5.1. Survival Equipment and restraint devices.
      A21.5.1.1. Overwater flight. Life preserver and HEED (Helicopter Emergency Egress
      Device or equivalent device) will be worn by aircrew and a life raft will be on-board for
      over water flights when route of flight is beyond autorotational gliding distance of land.
      Ensure sufficient LPUs are available for all passengers. Life rafts are not required if a
      radio-equipped boat or a hoist-equipped helicopter provides mutual support coverage.
      Life rafts, life preservers, and HEEDs are not required when over water flight occurs only
      for short distances immediately after takeoff or before landing.
      A21.5.1.2. Survival vests will be IAW AFI 11-301 and applicable supplements.
      A21.5.1.3. Restraint Devices. Gunner‘s belts are authorized for crew members when
      duties require them in lieu of a seat and lap belt. Only one gunner‘s belt may be attached
      to a tie down ring at any one time. If seats are available, aircrew members will be seated
      in a seat with a lap belt. Passengers involved in AIE operations and / or paradrop
238                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


      operations may be restrained by alternate methods, provided multiple individuals are not
      secured to the same tie down ring.
  A21.5.2. Preflight.
      A21.5.2.1. Before applying power to the aircraft and / or operating aircraft systems, the
      AFTO 781 series forms will be reviewed by a qualified crewmember. The exceptional
      release (ER) must be signed prior to flight by an authorized maintenance representative
      or, in the absence of a maintenance representative, the aircraft commander.
      A21.5.2.2. An operable white light (landing or searchlight) is required for all night
      flights.
  A21.5.3. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations.
      A21.5.3.1. Crewmembers may accomplish refueling duties when maintenance personnel
      are not available. Crewmembers will comply with T.O. 00-25-172. When not directly
      involved in the refueling operation, personnel will remain a minimum of 50 feet from the
      aircraft. Hot refueling (engines running) may be accomplished IAW T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1
      and T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1CL-2
      A21.5.3.2. Engine-running crew changes may be accomplished under the following
      provisions: one pilot will have seat belt and shoulder harness fastened during pilot
      change, the new aircraft commander will review aircraft weight and balance and
      configuration, and current takeoff and landing data must be computed.
      A21.5.3.3. Fire Guard. A fire guard will be used for all engine starts. When maintenance
      personnel are not available, a crewmember may perform this duty. The primary duty is
      to assist the crew in evacuating the aircraft should a fire occur, not fight the fire at the
      engine compartment.
  A21.5.4. En Route.
      A21.5.4.1. Forced or Precautionary Landings. Aircraft commanders must consider a
      precautionary landing as an option when mechanical malfunctions or deteriorating
      weather interfere with mission accomplishment. The following procedures apply to all
      forced and precautionary landings:
         A21.5.4.1.1. Make every effort to notify a controlling agency (i. e., declare an
         emergency if necessary IAW FLIP guidance) before making a forced or
         precautionary landing (time permitting).
         A21.5.4.1.2. Every effort will be made to contact the SOF (ground- to- ground/
         ground- to- air/ telephone) once the aircraft is safely on the ground.
         A21.5.4.1.3. For precautionary landings due to deteriorating weather, the flight may
         be continued at the discretion of the aircraft commander.
         A21.5.4.1.4. For actual, impending, or potential malfunctions, corrective action will
         be completed before continuing flight and OG/CC approval must be received prior to
         continuing flight. If contact cannot be established and if the aircraft commander
         determines it is potentially more hazardous to await maintenance assistance, he/ she
         may continue the flight to the nearest suitable area if the aircraft commander
         determines flight manual actions have corrected the malfunction.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                    239


  A21.5.5. Transition Maneuvers/Emergency Procedure Training.
     A21.5.5.1. Emergency procedures will be conducted at an approved landing area under
     radio communications with the appropriate controlling agency (for example, tower,
     runway supervisory unit, UNICOM, etc.). Aircraft rescue and fire-fighting equipment
     will be immediately available. All practice emergency procedures will be briefed during
     the flight briefing. Crews will complete the transition/emergency procedure briefing in
     the UH-1N In-Flight Guide.
     A21.5.5.2. Slide Landing Training Areas. Slide landings will only be accomplished to
     runways or suitable taxiways, with ATC approval. Exercise extreme caution on barrier-
     equipped runways. Slide landings may also be accomplished to other approved surfaces
     meeting helicopter runway criteria specified in AFMAN 32-1123, Airfield and Heliport
     Planning. Minimum dimensions will be IAW UFC 3-260-01, Airfield Facilities Design.
     If wind information at the slide area cannot be obtained through tower or AWOS, a wind
     detection device must be present.
        A21.5.5.2.1. The aircraft commander will accomplish the following:
            A21.5.5.2.1.1. Brief the hazards of the slide landing area prior to commencing
            any maneuvers.
            A21.5.5.2.1.2. Visually inspect the slide area for hazards and surface condition. If
            the visual inspection was inconclusive, test the surface prior to commencing
            emergency procedures by accomplishing a slide landing with both throttles full
            open.
     A21.5.5.3. Simulated Emergency Procedures.
        A21.5.5.3.1. Prohibited Training Maneuvers. The following maneuvers will not be
        intentionally accomplished in the aircraft:
            A21.5.5.3.1.1. Actual engine shutdown.
            A21.5.5.3.1.2. Blade stall and power settling.
            A21.5.5.3.1.3. Dual fuel control failures.
            A21.5.5.3.1.4. Dual hydraulic system failures.
            A21.5.5.3.1.5. Hovering autorotation.
        A21.5.5.3.2. Training Restrictions. Unusual attitude training and emergency
        procedures involving engines (to include simulated autorotations), engine fuel
        systems, flight controls, or hydraulic systems will be accomplished only:
            A21.5.5.3.2.1. During visual meteorological conditions.
            A21.5.5.3.2.2. After official sunrise/prior to official sunset (extended daylight
            hours may be authorized by MAJCOM).
            A21.5.5.3.2.3. When passengers are not on board.
            A21.5.5.3.2.4. With an instructor pilot designated on the flight authorization.
        A21.5.5.3.3. Single Engine Emergencies. Simulated single engine failure will be
        entered no lower than 150 feet AGL and 55 KIAS while in-flight. Single engine
240                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


         emergencies may be initiated from the ground or in a hover if single engine hover
         power is available. Single engine approaches may be initiated below 150 feet AGL as
         long as simulated torque available is limited with both throttles full open. If a throttle
         is reduced to flight idle, ensure that combined torque is below single engine computed
         to prevent over torque of the remaining engine. Single engine approaches and
         landings must be practiced to a slide or hard surface landing area.
         A21.5.5.3.4. Boost Off. Minimum entry altitude and airspeed is 500 feet AGL 70
         KIAS during straight and level flight, or on the ground.
         A21.5.5.3.5. Manual Fuel. Minimum entry altitude and airspeed is 500 feet AGL and
         70 KIAS, in a hover if single engine hover capability is available, or on the ground.
         Before entering into manual fuel, ensure that the collective setting is below single
         engine computed torque available. After entering into manual fuel, maintain torque
         on the manually governed engine approximately five to ten percent below the
         governed engine. During high density altitude conditions, it may be required to
         maintain torque on the ungoverned engine less than five percent to preclude over
         temp, over speed, and/or over torque of the governed engine.
         A21.5.5.3.6. Practice Autorotations. Due to the risk associated with this maneuver,
         carefully consider wind, density altitude, aircraft gross weight, and individual pilot
         proficiency prior to performing autorotations. The IP will terminate the maneuver and
         initiate a power recovery at the first indication of abnormally high or low rotor RPM,
         excessive sink rate, low airspeed, ineffective flare or at anytime an inadvertent
         touchdown may occur.
             A21.5.5.3.6.1. The initial autorotation will be a straight-ahead autorotation
             accomplished by the instructor to evaluate aircraft performance. On evaluation
             flights, the instructor receiving the evaluation may accomplish this requirement.
             A21.5.5.3.6.2. Practice autorotation will be accomplished to an area clear of
             obstructions that permits a safe go-around.
             A21.5.5.3.6.3. Practice autorotations require the aircraft landing direction to be
             aligned within 45 degrees of the wind direction when wind is 15 knots or greater.
             With winds less than 15 knots, aircraft landing direction must be within 90
             degrees of wind direction.
             A21.5.5.3.6.4. Minimum entry altitude is 800 feet above ground level (AGL) for
             180 degree turning autorotations; 500 feet AGL for all others. Practice
             autorotations in excess of 180 degrees must terminate with a power recovery at or
             above 500 feet AGL unless aligned on final for an approved training area within
             normal autorotation parameters.
             A21.5.5.3.6.5. Simulated instrument autorotation must be terminated with full
             power recovery no lower than 500 feet AGL unless conducted to an area meeting
             the requirements above.
  A21.5.6. Medical Evacuation / Search and Rescue (SAR).
      A21.5.6.1. Aeromedical Evacuation Missions. Aircraft will not be used for routine
      patient transfer. Medical evacuation flights may be operated to transport seriously ill or
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                  241


     injured persons and/or to transport medical personnel, equipment, or supplies under
     emergency conditions when other means are not suitable or readily available.
     A21.5.6.2. Search and Rescue (SAR). SAR missions involving life threatening
     injuries/illnesses will not launch until authorized and thorough mission planning is
     complete. Crews will attempt to coordinate medical support if time and circumstances
     permit.
         A21.5.6.2.1. Altitude Restrictions:
             A21.5.6.2.1.1. Operational Searches. Altitudes are determined by the aircraft
             commander and are dependent on terrain, aircraft limitations, crew limitations,
             weather, etc.
             A21.5.6.2.1.2. Training Searches. Any search training below 300‘ must be in a
             surveyed low level area. Day search training can be accomplished down to a
             minimum altitude of 100‘ AHO. NVG search training can be accomplished to a
             minimum altitude of 300‘ AGL / AWL. Night unaided search training can be
             accomplished to a minimum altitude of 500‘ AGL/AWL.
  A21.5.7. Operational / Unprepared Landing Site Procedures. This section provides guidance
  for the successful accomplishment of operational and unprepared landing site operations. The
  aircraft commander must consider crew qualification, aircraft power and capability, weather
  (including winds), terrain, environmental factors, illumination and mission requirements
  before performing any approach to an unprepared landing area. The final decision to
  accomplish the approach or landing rests with the aircraft commander.
     A21.5.7.1. Power Available Check. Perform a power available check prior to remote,
     AIE, search, cargo sling, fire bucket, controlled burn missions, or anytime time use of
     maximum or near-maximum power is anticipated.
     A21.5.7.2. Landing Area Evaluations.
         A21.5.7.2.1. Operational Sites. Operational sites are areas specifically prepared and
         maintained for helicopter operations (not including airports or helipads listed in FLIP
         documents). Units will designate permanent operational sites and develop site
         diagrams. These sites may be used for routine landings and do not require a full
         remote site evaluation.
         A21.5.7.2.2. Site Diagrams. Refer to AFI 13-217.
         A21.5.7.2.3. Operational Site Evaluation (OSE). The pilot will review the site
         diagram prior to accomplishing an Operational Site Evaluation (OSE) for all
         operational site landings. This review will highlight hazards and will assist the crew
         in determining the best approach/departure route. The pilot will review the site
         diagram prior to all landings and takeoffs at the site. Evaluate and confirm elevation,
         power requirements, obstructions, wind, and approach and departure routes before
         initiating final approach. A power available check is not required unless the aircraft
         commander believes a critical requirement exists. The purpose of the site evaluation
         is to alert the pilot to unforeseen, dangerous situations prior to being committed for
         final landing. If a site diagram is unavailable or non-current, complete a remote site
         evaluation.
242                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


         A21.5.7.2.4. Remote Landing Sites. Areas not defined as operational sites are
         considered unprepared or unfamiliar landing areas. Operating into these areas require
         a remote site evaluation which consists of a high and low reconnaissance. The full
         site evaluation does not need to be re-accomplished during successive approaches to
         the same area where conditions are equal to or less restrictive than previous
         approaches.
         A21.5.7.2.5. High Reconnaissance. The high reconnaissance is flown at a minimum
         of 300 feet above the site and a minimum airspeed of 50 KIAS. During this
         reconnaissance, in addition to T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1 or T.O. 1H-1(T)H-1 requirements,
         the crew will evaluate:
             A21.5.7.2.5.1. Winds – direction, turbulence, and null areas.
             A21.5.7.2.5.2. Elevation, pressure altitude.
             A21.5.7.2.5.3. Temperature.
             A21.5.7.2.5.4. Power available, power required, power margin.
             A21.5.7.2.5.5. Approach and departure route.
             A21.5.7.2.5.6. Size, slope, surface suitability.
             A21.5.7.2.5.7. Touchdown point.
             A21.5.7.2.5.8. Escape route (brown out / white out heading, abort Go/No-Go).
         A21.5.7.2.6. Low Reconnaissance. The low reconnaissance confirms items noted in
         the high reconnaissance. Pilots may descend to a minimum of 50 feet above the
         highest obstacle along the flight path and at a minimum of 50 knots to reconfirm
         items noted on the high reconnaissance. The pilot should fly the low reconnaissance
         on the same approach angle and approach route as discussed during the high
         reconnaissance. If the selected approach route is not satisfactory, select another route
         and execute another low reconnaissance. The low reconnaissance may be
         accomplished on final approach if OGE hover power is available.
      A21.5.7.3. Communication. On final approach, the pilot not flying / flight engineer will
      make advisory calls in 100 foot increments when above 300 feet AGL and 50 feet
      increments when below 300 feet AGL. The advisory will include altitude and airspeed
      and, at the pilot‘s discretion, descent rate and power applied (i.e.,‖250 feet, 40 knots, sink
      500 [fpm], torque 50‖). After each advisory call, the FE/scanner(s) will provide
      terrain/hazard clearance inputs. Advisory calls should be clear and concise with
      commentary on the progress of the approach and hover operation.
      A21.5.7.4. Landing. When landing in an unfamiliar LZ, plan the approach to a hover to
      avoid landing on hidden obstacles. After landing, slowly reduce power until surface
      stability is verified. This procedure will facilitate an immediate departure as well as
      prevent possible tipping and/or aircraft damage due to unstable surface. When landing to
      dry grassy areas, landing/searchlights should be turned off to prevent inadvertent ground
      fires.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                   243


         A21.5.7.4.1. Obstacle Clearance. Whenever rotor clearance is 25 feet or less, the
         scanner will inform the pilot of the clock position relative to the nose of the aircraft
         and estimated distance to the obstacle.
  A21.5.8. Night Operations.
     A21.5.8.1. Night Approaches to Remote and Operational Sites. Do not leave flight
     altitude until the location of the landing area has been identified. Brief and conduct a
     remote site evaluation prior to the approach, provided adequate lighting is available.
     A21.5.8.2. During night VFR descents, the pilot not flying / flight engineer will call
     1,000 feet above intended altitude, 500 feet above intended altitude, 100 feet above
     intended altitude, and intended altitude. On final approach, the pilot not flying / FE will
     call rates of descent greater than 500 fpm.
  A21.5.9. NVG Operations.
     A21.5.9.1. The searchlight must be operable and equipped with an IR filter for flights
     conducted below 20 percent EMI (Equivalent Moon Illumination). When EMI is below
     20 percent, minimum enroute altitude is 300 feet AHO with an operable radar altimeter.
     If both radar altimeters are inoperative, minimum enroute altitude is 500 feet AHO.
     A21.5.9.2. Comply with the NVG preflight procedures in applicable NVG T.O. (e.g.,
     T.O. 12S10-2AVS9-2). Do not fly with NVGs that fail to meet the visual acuity
     requirements.
     A21.5.9.3. Training will not be conducted with less than 5% EMI. Adequacy of lighting
     on moonless nights will be evaluated by crew, taking into consideration cultural lighting
     and cloud cover.
  A21.5.10. Unaided Night Operations.
     A21.5.10.1. Minimum en-route altitude is 500 feet AHO within 5 miles of the flight path
     on either side of course center.
     A21.5.10.2. Site Selection for Training. In addition to AFI 13-217 Drop Zone and
     Landing Zone Procedures, the following apply. Sites will be selected where the vertical
     development of the surrounding terrain does not restrict the pilot‘s option to execute a go-
     around, with minimum maneuvering, at any point during the approach.
     A21.5.10.3. The obstacles/terrain within three NM of the site will not exceed 200 feet
     above the site elevation. Restricting the approach and departure route to directions that
     will avoid terrain or obstacles exceeding the above criteria satisfies this requirement.
     A21.5.10.4. Illumination Requirements for Helicopter Landing Areas. Helicopters on
     operational support missions may operate into and from unlighted areas provided all
     available illumination is used. On all other missions, operations into remote or
     operational sites between official sunset and official sunrise will be made only if one of
     the following conditions can be met:
         A21.5.10.4.1. The area is outlined by discernible lights.
         A21.5.10.4.2. The pilot can clearly see the approach path and landing surface (as
         would be possible immediately after official sunset or before sunrise).
 244                                 AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


          A21.5.10.4.3. For sites without permanent lighting, prior to full darkness (may be
          within 30 minutes after official sunset or 30 minutes before official sunrise), make a
          visual survey of the site and position lights to outline the landing area. Check for
          obstacles, general site condition, and wind. This survey may be accomplished by
          other crews flying during the day or by ground party.
       A21.5.10.5. Landing Zone Lighting Patterns. Since a variety of landing zone lighting
       patterns are in use, the pilot should anticipate diversity in lighting patterns when
       participating in joint and/or combined operations. The inverted Y light system, see
       Figure A21.1, is an excellent way to identify landing zones. The two lights at the base of
       the inverted Y should normally be spaced 15 paces to the sides of the helicopter. The
       lights for the stem of the inverted Y should set into the wind, 20 paces apart. When set
       up in this fashion, the inverted Y provides visual cues to determine the correctness of the
       glide angle by observing the apparent distance between the lights in the stem of the Y. If
       the lights in the stem appear merged into a single light, a shallow glide angle is indicated.
       If the lights in the stem appear to increase in distance apart, the approach is becoming
       steeper. Approach path lineup corrections can also be made using the stem of the Y. For
       example, if the stem points to the left, the helicopter is left of course and should correct to
       the right. The direction of the approach is into the open end of the Y. The touchdown
       area is outlined by the triangle formed by the three lights marking the open end of the Y.
       When set up properly, wind direction will be along the stem of the Y.

   A21.5.11. Ship Board Operations
       A21.5.11.1. General. Aircrews will abide by the versions, to include marshaling
       procedures outlined in the following: Joint Publication 3-04.1 Joint Tactics, Techniques,
       and Procedures for Shipboard Helicopter Operations (Electronically or updated CD
       version) and AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground. Aircrew
       will conduct shipboard operations training IAW Navy/Army/Air Force Memorandum of
       Understanding. Refer to AFI 11-2FT Volume 1 for all training requirements.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                  245


     A21.5.11.2. Mission Commanders will ensure that all personnel receive a pre-
     deployment briefing consisting of the following:
         A21.5.11.2.1. Launch Procedures and light/hand signals.
         A21.5.11.2.2. Landing Procedures and light/hand signals.
         A21.5.11.2.3. Aircraft control doctrine and procedures.
         A21.5.11.2.4. Emergency procedures peculiar to shipboard operations
         A21.5.11.2.5. Special procedures for night and IFR.
         A21.5.11.2.6. Communication.
         A21.5.11.2.7. Ship Resume.
  A21.5.12. Aerial Delivery Operations.
     A21.5.12.1. Aerial delivery operations refer to air movement of personnel, supplies, or
     equipment in which unloading is accomplished from the aircraft while in flight.
     A21.5.12.2. Drop Procedures. Refer to AFI 11-301V1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE)
     Program, AFJI 13-210, Joint Airdrop Inspection Records, Malfunction Investigations,
     and Activity Reporting, 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Rating
     and Badges , FM 31- 19 (US Army), and applicable T.Os for all operations.
  A21.5.13. External Load Operations.
     A21.5.13.1. External load operations refers to equipment transport via cargo hook. This
     includes cargo sling and fire bucket operations. Refer to the UH-1N In-Flight Guide for
     preflight criteria.
     A21.5.13.2. Crews will complete the applicable briefings outlined in the UH-1N In-
     Flight Guide prior to accomplishing the mission.
     A21.5.13.3. Refer to T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1, T.O. 1H-1(T)H-1, AFJAM 11-223 Volumes 1-3,
     AFOSHSTD 91-46 for the cargo sling.
  A21.5.14. Fire Bucket Operations.
     A21.5.14.1. General. Firefighting is one of the most hazardous missions performed by
     the UH-1N. During actual fires, the entire crew must exercise extreme caution due to the
     rapidly changing conditions and multiple aircraft operating in and around the fire area. If
     at any time the safety of the crew is in question, aircraft commanders will cease
     operations and clear the area. Avoid over-flight of ground personnel, structures, vehicles,
     etc. to the maximum extent possible.
     A21.5.14.2. Mission Preparation.
         A21.5.14.2.1. Conduct a fire bucket briefing prior to all fire bucket operations. The
         ingress checklist will be accomplished per the guidance in the UH-1N In-Flight
         Guide. Complete the egress checklist upon leaving the fire area.
         A21.5.14.2.2. Fire Bucket Terminology. The fire bucket itself is referred to as the
         ―bucket,‖ and the water source is referred to as ―water.‖ If at any time the presence
246                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


         of the bucket constitutes a hazard, any crewmember may call ―Pickle, Pickle, Pickle.‖
         If this call is made, the pilot will release the load immediately, without discussion.
      A21.5.14.3. Drop Control.
         A21.5.14.3.1. Airspeed and Direction. Drops made into the wind or at slower
         airspeed increase the concentration of the drop by shortening the swath. Drops made
         downwind or at higher airspeeds will reduce concentration and increase swath length.
         A21.5.14.3.2. Altitude. Altitude affects concentration in swath width; the lower the
         drop, the narrower the swath and the heavier the concentration. Conversely, the
         higher the drop, the more time the water mass has to break up into droplets and be
         dispersed by wind drift, therefore, the wider the swath and the lighter the
         concentration. The standard drop is from 50-foot AHO bucket height and 50 knots
         indicated airspeed.
             A21.5.14.3.2.1. Set the radar altimeters for the length of the load plus 10 feet.
             When calling altitudes, flight engineers will relay bucket height above the ground
             and /or obstacles.
      A21.5.14.4. Drop Techniques. Drops on structures, equipment or personnel should be
      avoided unless specifically requested or there is an obvious threat to someone‘s life.
         A21.5.14.4.1. Hover / Spot Drops. Except on isolated snags or trees, hover drops are
         not recommended on active ground fire, unless well inside a burned area, since the
         rotor downwash will intensify and spread far more fire than the drop will extinguish.
         If attempting to concentrate the bulk of a drop on a single target a low airspeed, high
         altitude drop will be just as effective while avoiding adverse consequences of the
         rotor downwash.
         A21.5.14.4.2. Cross-slope drops. Cross-slope drop, whether above or below the fire,
         usually present no special problems; however, watch the main rotor clearance on the
         uphill side in steep terrain.
         A21.5.14.4.3. Down slope drops. Down slope drops low on the slope may be
         approached cross-slope at a reduced airspeed with a 90-degree descending turn to the
         target. This allows the pilot flying to see the target if turning in the direction of the
         side they are sitting on. Another less recommended method is to come directly over
         the ridge for the drop. This type of drop requires careful planning, especially in steep
         terrain. The pilot must pick out objects on top of the ridge above the fire and in the
         background beyond the fire to line up on, as the down slope drop presents a blind run.
         This means that the pilot cannot see the target until crossing the ridge above the fire
         and only if not obscured by smoke. If the slope is very steep it may be advisable to
         approach the ridge top at a reduced airspeed, using caution not to get too slow if
         downwind or too low when on the leeward side. Slowing prior to the ―dive‖ reduces
         the chance of excessive airspeed. The pullout must be planned to provide adequate
         terrain clearance in the event the drop is aborted for any reason. Down slope drops
         may be made at a slower airspeed and are more effective if made into the wind.
  A21.5.15. Alternate Insertion/Extraction Operations.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                       247


     A21.5.15.1. Alternate insertion/extraction (AIE) is the insertion or extraction of any
     personnel by means other than landing the aircraft. The following procedures apply to
     day and night operations.
     A21.5.15.2. Equipment.
         A21.5.15.2.1. The flight engineer will accomplish preflight and post-flight
         inspections of all AIE equipment used in flight. Preflight/post-flight will be
         accomplished IAW T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1, T.O. 1H-1(T)H-1, and the UH-1N In-Flight
         Guide. The flight engineer will also accomplish all required cleaning of AIE
         equipment which is outlined in the cleaning criteria checklist located with the AIE
         equipment.
         A21.5.15.2.2. During all live AIE training, personnel being inserted / extracted will
         wear eye protection, any uniform that completely covers the arms and legs, a helmet,
         and either leather or flight gloves.
         A21.5.15.2.3. All hoist-equipped aircraft will have precision wire rope cutters readily
         available in the event the electrical cable cut guillotine fails. Affix cable cutters to the
         aircraft or hoist for quick access.
     A21.5.15.3. Aircrew Procedures:
         A21.5.15.3.1. Water AIE.
             A21.5.15.3.1.1. Conduct all water AIE training a minimum of 50 yards offshore
             in approved water training areas.
             A21.5.15.3.1.2. Both radar altimeters must be operable for all water operations.
             A21.5.15.3.1.3. Observation pass. If an observation pass is required, after the
             initial sighting of the survivor, maneuver to a position approximately 100 feet
             downwind of the survivor from which an observation pass can be accomplished.
             Pattern direction (either left or right patterns) is at the discretion of the pilot. If
             swimmer deployment is anticipated, the observation pass will be made at a
             maximum of ten-feet AWL and ten knots with a heading from zero to 90 degrees
             off the wind line to allow for swimmer deployment. If swimmer deployment is
             not required, make the observation pass above ETL at a minimum of 25 feet
             AWL. After the observation pass, initiate a climbing turn at 50 feet AWL to a 100
             feet AWL minimum downwind altitude. If OGE hover power is not available, a
             minimum of 50 KIAS and 50 feet AWL is required prior to initiating the climbing
             turn to downwind. If OGE hover power is available, start the turn at a minimum
             of translation lift airspeed and 50 feet AWL.
             A21.5.15.3.1.4. Do not descend below 50 feet AWL until established on final. If
             the survivor is not ready for immediate pickup, situation permitting, establish a
             holding hover approximately 75 feet downwind of the survivor.
  A21.5.16. Hoist Operations.
     A21.5.16.1. Limitations. Restrict live hoist training to the minimum necessary to
     accomplish initial qualification, re-qualification and support training. The unit CC/DO
     will determine eligibility of personnel to ride the hoist during training.
248                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


      A21.5.16.2. Land Hoist. Recommended ―live‖ hoist altitude is 10 feet, but will be no
      greater than 25 feet for training.
      A21.5.16.3. Water Hoist. Recommended hoist altitude over water or vessels is the
      minimum altitude necessary to avoid salt spray and/or shipboard obstacles. Do not
      conduct live hoist training over water or ships if required hover altitude exceeds 50 feet.
      A21.5.16.4. Water Hoist Recoveries. Install the flotation collar prior to lowering the
      forest penetrator. It is recommended to place at least one seat paddle in the down
      position and remove one safety strap from the stowed position. Do not unhook the safety
      strap fastener from the penetrator.
      A21.5.16.5. Grounding. Ground the hoist hook to discharge static electricity to prevent
      personnel on the ground or water from sustaining a shock. To preclude ignition of fuel,
      do not ground the hoist near damaged aircraft or vehicles.
      A21.5.16.6. Hoist Rescue Devices. Approved rescue devices include the forest
      penetrator, rescue basket, stokes litter, rope ladder, hook and survivor‘s sling. A survivor
      unfamiliar with the rescue device will be assisted by a crewmember to ensure proper
      entry and security for a safe pickup. The aircrew determines which device is most
      appropriate for each scenario.
         A21.5.16.6.1. Survivor‘s Sling (Horse Collar). The survivor‘s sling (NSN 1680-00-
         5A21.43-2712) is a buoyant device consisting of a fiber filling encased in a brightly
         colored waterproof cover to facilitate high visibility during rescue operations.
         Webbing, woven through the cover with both ends terminating in two v-rings, is used
         to attach the sling to the hoist hook. Two retainer straps, one long with a quick
         ejector snap and one short with a v-ring, are provided for personnel security.
         Additional information on the survivor‘s sling is found in NAVAIR 13-1-1-6.5.
         Personnel performing rescue operations when it is impossible for the helicopter to
         land use the survivor‘s sling. The sling can be used to lower a rescuer, as well as
         raise a survivor over land or water. Use the same procedures as for the forest
         penetrator.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                  249

                             F-22 OPERATING PROCEDURES

A22.1. General Information. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives,
outlines procedures for operation of the F-22 aircraft under most circumstances. It applies to
AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of all F-22 aircraft.
Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe,
effective mission accomplishment.
A22.2. Mission Planning. None additional
A22.3. Common Mission Guidance.
   A22.3.1. General Requirements.
       A22.3.1.1. Wear of the upper pressure garment is required when flying above 44,000
       feet MSL or at greater than 6g.
       A22.3.1.2. Publications, maps and personal items placed in the cockpit will be secured to
       avoid flight control or throttle interference.
   A22.3.2. Ground/Taxi Operations.
       A22.3.2.1. Keep hands in view of ground personnel during quick check, arming or
       dearming operations. If the intercom system is not used during EOR checks, the pilot
       will establish and maintain visual contact with the ground personnel to allow the use of
       visual signals.
       A22.3.2.2. When ground intercom is not used, use visual signals IAW AFI 11-218,
       Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground, and this instruction. All signals
       pertaining to operation of aircraft systems will originate with the pilot. The crew chief
       will repeat the given signals when it is safe to operate the system. The pilot should not
       activate any system that could pose danger to the ground crew prior to receiving proper
       acknowledgment from ground personnel. The following signals augment AFI 11-218:
          A22.3.2.2.1. APU Start. With clenched fist, make a pulling motion.
          A22.3.2.2.2. Engine Start. Hold up number of fingers corresponding to which engine
          is being started, and make circling motion.
          A22.3.2.2.3. Flight Control Check. Raise right arm, clench fist, and make a stirring
          motion.
          A22.3.2.2.4. Refueling Receptacle Open or Close. Display hand flat on top of
          helmet with fingers extended. To open, raise fingers to the vertical position and heel
          of hand remaining stationary. To close, reverse signal.
          A22.3.2.2.5. Weapons Bay Open or Close. Display hands with fingers extended,
          palms up and edges of hands touching. Move hands apart several times.
   A22.3.3. Takeoff.
250                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


      A22.3.3.1. Make an afterburner takeoff when configured with two external wing tanks or
      anytime the computed MIL power takeoff roll exceeds 50 percent of the available
      runway.
      A22.3.3.2. Aircraft will steer toward the center of the runway at the start of the takeoff
      roll.
      A22.3.3.3. Do not takeoff with an SES LOW ICAW.
      A22.3.3.4. Formation takeoffs with inert internal munitions are permitted.
  A22.3.4. Maneuvering Parameters. For aerobatics, remain above 5,000 feet AGL. During
  nose high/low speed and Advanced Handling Characteristics vertical maneuvering, ensure
  maneuvers are terminated to allow recovery above 5,000 feet AGL.
  A22.3.5. Ops Checks.
      A22.3.5.1. Accomplish sufficient ops checks to ensure safe mission accomplishment.
      Ops checks are required during climb or at level off after takeoff, prior to each
      engagement, and following air refueling.
      A22.3.5.2. Minimum items to check are ICAWS, total fuel, G-suit connection, oxygen
      system, cabin altitude, and HUD maximum G indicator.
      A22.3.5.3. The query and response for ops checks will include total fuel amount as read
      on the Standby Flight Group. If wingmen are within 500 lbs of the flight lead, a ―same‖
      call may be used.
      A22.3.5.4. When external tanks are feeding, add a ―tanks feeding‖ call to the normal ops
      check reply. Make a ―tanks dry‖ call once the external tanks are confirmed dry. Once
      the ―tanks dry‖ call has been made, no further reference to tanks needs to be made on
      subsequent ops checks.
  A22.3.6. Fuel Requirements. Do not use AB below established bingo fuel, unless required
  for safety of flight.
  A22.3.7. Battle Damage Checks. When circumstances permit, flight leads will direct a battle
  damage check after each mission prior to or during RTB. Brief deconfliction responsibilities
  and position change procedures.

         A22.3.10.1.2. The landing light and a position light on each wingtip must be
         operational for flight. If only two position lights are operating, one must be on top of
         the wing and one on the bottom.
         A22.3.10.1.3. For taxi and takeoff, the POSN/ANTI-COLL switch should be set to
         FLASH. In jets modified with reduced-intensity anti-collision lights, the ANTI-
         COLL/BRT setting may be used.
         A22.3.10.1.4. After join-up, the last aircraft in the flight should remain in the takeoff
         setting. Flight lead will set position setting 2 and adjust as needed. Other flight
         members set BRT unless otherwise directed.
      A22.3.10.2. Night Vision Goggles (NVGs).
         A22.3.10.2.1. NVGs may be worn for night tanker rejoins, but will be raised to the
         up/stowed position or removed no later than the pre-contact position.
         A22.3.10.2.2. Unless required for battle damage checks or aircraft assistance,
         wingmen wearing NVGs will fly no closer than route formation.
   A22.3.11. Air-to-Air Weapons Employment
      A22.3.11.1. Simulated Gun Employment. A loaded gun is considered safe and simulated

AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                    253


                                        Attachment 23
                             RQ-4 OPERATING PROCEDURES

A23.1. General Information. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives,
outlines procedures for operation of the RQ-4 aircraft under most circumstances. It applies to
both Air Force and Contractor AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with
operation of all RQ-4 aircraft. Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be
accomplished if they enhance safe, effective mission accomplishment.
   A23.1.1. Phase Manuals. Phase manuals are "how to" documents that expand on basic
   procedures in flight manuals and applicable USAF instructions. Training units may develop
   these manuals from procedures contained in relevant documents to enhance volume and
   provide student crewmembers with explanatory study material. Phase manuals will not be
   less restrictive than flight manuals and applicable USAF instructions. Operational units may
   use phase manuals to augment mission qualification and continuation training.
   A23.1.2. Crew. The crew is defined as personnel responsible for safe operation of the RQ-4
   aircraft. For the RQ-4, the term pilot refers to a pilot in the LRE or MCE or to the Mission
   Commander (MC).
       A23.1.2.1. Minimum Crew: Common Ground Station (CGS): Pilot (MCE/LRE/MC)
       A23.1.2.2. The MC is responsible for the smooth conduct of the mission including air
       vehicle routing, collection objectives, and crew duties. Though not always directly
       controlling the aircraft, the MC is the Pilot In Command (PIC) with the authority and
       responsibilities outlined in AFI 11-202V3. The MC is the final authority on mission and
       flight issues. The MC should maximize the mission objectives while maintaining safety
       of flight.
          A23.1.2.2.1. For all ground and flight operations, at least one pilot will occupy the
          controlling shelter at all times. Normally, two pilots will be scheduled for each shift
          of a long mission allowing each to take breaks.
       A23.1.2.3. The SO is responsible for mission collection planning and management. The
       SO is responsible for monitoring image quality, controlling the automatic or manual
       imagery dissemination, and assisting the pilot as required with checklists and available
       crew aids.
       A23.1.2.4. The Hawkeye is responsible for executing the pilot‘s aircraft exterior
       inspection; verifying the aircraft is properly configured for each phase of ground
       movement, takeoff, and landing; visually clearing appropriate taxiways and runway areas
       prior to and during taxi, takeoff, and landing operations; alerting the PIC of any required
       corrective action; and maintaining constant communications with the PIC in order to
       maintain safe ground operations prior to launch and after landing until engine shut down
       and ground safety pin insertion.
A23.2. Mission Planning.
   A23.2.1. Responsibilities.
254                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


      A23.2.1.1. Mission Commanders (MC). The MC is responsible for mission planning and
      briefing. Mission planning and mission briefing are two separate activities. The MCs
      and mission planners will jointly review mission plans to ensure mission effectiveness
      and safety if a mission planner is available. (mission planner may not be on-site at FOLs).
      A23.2.1.2. Commanders will ensure currency of all mission planning materials and
      compliance with command guidance. Squadron and Forward Operating Location
      operations officers will schedule adequate mission planning time prior to flight.
      A23.2.1.3. Crewmembers other than the crew flying the mission may accomplish
      mission planning. If operationally necessary, mission elements and events may be
      modified the day of the flight or while the RQ-4 is airborne as long as changes do not
      compromise flight safety. The MC will ensure all crewmembers acknowledge any
      changes.
      A23.2.1.4. Complete sufficient mission planning to ensure safe mission accomplishment.
      Areas covered will include, at a minimum, fuel requirements, takeoff and landing data
      (when applicable), mission objectives, threat study (when applicable), departure/arrival
      procedures including thorough contingency route planning, communication plan, and
      collection plan. The use of RQ-4 certified departures and arrivals ensure safe margins for
      varying conditions including winds, wet runway, aircraft weight, Differential Global
      Positioning System (DGPS) tolerances, etc. This does not relieve the MC of ensuring a
      safe mission plan for current conditions. Any additional risks must be briefed and
      elevated to the appropriate authority for approval if required.
  A23.2.2. Mission Materials.
      A23.2.2.1. AFMSS Mission Plan. The mission plan is created entirely in AFMSS
      consisting of Navigation route, collection plan, communications plan, and other required
      files. The Mission Generation Process of creating these files is complicated and has the
      potentiality for human errors.
      A23.2.2.2. Mission Materials. AFMSS produces products to aid the crew in mission
      monitoring. Products include: flight plan, sensor plan, action points, screen capture
      charts showing the route in various scales, etc. Units will standardize the mission
      materials package to allow for maximum situational awareness and flexibility to the pilot
      and cover all possible contingencies (emergency routes). A copy of the Flight Operators
      Manual and associated directives will be available in each ground shelter.
  A23.2.3. Briefing/Debriefing.
      A23.2.3.1. Briefing Guides. Briefing guides provide the briefer with a reference list of
      items that may apply to particular missions. The briefer should cover only mission
      essential information. Those items understood by all participants may be briefed as
      "standard.‖ Reference 452 FLTS OI 11-1RQ for squadron specific briefing guides.
      A23.2.3.2. Mission Brief (or T-1 Brief). The MC will brief all crew members to ensure
      safe and effective mission accomplishment. Use the following procedures for all mission
      briefings:
         A23.2.3.2.1. All crewmembers scheduled to support the mission will attend the
         briefing. Students in combined Initial Qualification Training (IQT)/Mission
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                    255


          Qualification Training (MQT) and crewmembers who are logging individual events
          for currency do not need to attend the mission briefing provided they are under the
          supervision of an instructor who attended the briefing; however, they must receive a
          changeover brief in their respective crew position before participating in the flight.
          Other crewmembers who did not attend a mission briefing must obtain Squadron
          Operations Officer (SQ/DO) approval prior to participating in a flight. The pilot in
          command or MC will ensure crewmembers participating in a flight under SQ/DO
          approval are adequately briefed prior to assuming crew duties.
          A23.2.3.2.2. Brief any manual pilot interventions in the case of contingencies not
          autonomously handled by the AV (if applicable).
          A23.2.3.2.3. Mission elements and events may be modified and briefed while the
          RQ-4 is airborne as long as changes do not compromise flight safety. Do not fly
          unbriefed missions and/or events. The pilot or MC will ensure all crewmembers
          acknowledge all changes.
          A23.2.3.2.4. Changeover Briefs.       Individual crewmembers will complete a
          changeover brief for each crew position changeover.
          A23.2.3.2.5. Mission Debrief. After changeover or landing, debrief all missions as a
          crew.
A23.3. Common Mission Guidance.
   A23.3.1. Common Ground Station (CGS).
      A23.3.1.1. The MC is the approval authority for visitor seating in the CGS. Only
      qualified pilots or students in a formal course of training and under instructor supervision
      may fly the RQ-4.
      A23.3.1.2. Ensure the RQ-4 is not in a critical phase of flight before entering the CGS.
      While the RQ-4 is airborne, all personnel will limit extraneous conversations.
      A23.3.1.3. Place no items (checklists, charts, etc.) on the keyboards or on the mouse at
      any time during ground or flight operations.
      A23.3.1.4. The MC will ensure the CGS is clean and orderly after a mission. All
      crewmembers are responsible for personal and professional items prior to departing the
      CGS.
      A23.3.1.5. The MC will ensure removal of all classified material from the CGS upon
      mission completion.
      A23.3.1.6. Smoking is prohibited in or within 50 feet of the CGS.
      A23.3.1.7. Crewmembers will take appropriate unclassified logs to mission debrief.
      A23.3.1.8. Crewmembers will operate in the CGS only those electronic items necessary
      for flight and/or mission operations.
   A23.3.2. Communications. Crewmembers will use the following crew positions for
   intercom identification and call up: ―MC,‖ ―pilot,‖ ―CX,‖ and ―QC‖ for the shelter. Call sign
   for the Vehicle Test Controller (VTC) is ―VTC.‖ Do not discuss classified information when
   making radio transmissions.
256                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


      A23.3.2.1. Ground Communications.
         A23.3.2.1.1. The pilot and ground crew will maintain good communication during all
         ground checks and anytime the aircraft's engine is operating on the ground.
         A23.3.2.1.2. VTC operator will maintain communication with the pilot as per
         checklist procedures
      A23.3.2.2. In-flight Communications.
         A23.3.2.2.1. Limit intercom communications to flight critical information from start
         of ―Before Starting Engine‖ checklist until completion of ―After Takeoff and Climb‖
         checklist and from initiation of ―Descent and Landing‖ checklist until completion of
         ―Shutdown‖ checklist. During critical phases of flight, keep a sterile environment
         consistent with good CRM procedures. Critical phases of flight are taxi, takeoff and
         departure up to safe altitude, arrival and landing, taxi back, shutdown, and any other
         time determined by the pilot in command.
         A23.3.2.2.2. Limit telephone calls to the CGS to time-critical flight related items.
         A23.3.2.2.3. Pilots flying the aircraft should not use the telephone during a critical
         phase of flight unless absolutely necessary for safe operations.
         A23.3.2.2.4. All crewmembers will monitor the intercom to the maximum extent
         possible and advise the pilot prior to going off intercom and will announce when back
         on intercom.
  A23.3.3. Checklists. Each pilot will have and refer to appropriate checklists during flight
  operations to ensure accomplishing required actions. The PIC will ensure accomplishment of
  all checklist items and when completed state applicable ―Checklist Complete."
  A23.3.4. Engine Start/Taxi.
      A23.3.4.1. All engine starts require a fireguard.
      A23.3.4.2. VTC operator starts the engine on pilot‘s command and announces each state
      of the start process (engine parameters, BIT checks, etc.). Ground Chase (―Hawkeye‖)
      will monitor engine start and maintain area control for the pilot.
      A23.3.4.3. The pilot taxiing the aircraft should designate only one ‗in-control‘ link. For
      local operations, two ‗in-control‘ links may be utilized to ensure C2 coverage and
      mitigate undesired taxi interruptions provided it is briefed and the pilot not in control also
      executes Stop Taxi commands as required.
      A23.3.4.4. Hawkeye will maintain position to accurately assess the position of the
      aircraft while taxi operations are performed. He will inform the pilot of any deviations in
      crosstrack, heading, and speed. The pilot will inform Hawkeye of impending turns,
      speed changes, stops, etc., as required.
  A23.3.5. Takeoff.
      A23.3.5.1. Do not taxi and/or takeoff over a raised cable or into a raised webbing-type
      barrier. Pilots may takeoff beyond or between raised cables provided there is 8000 ft of
      runway beyond or between barriers.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                    257


      A23.3.5.2. During departure/arrival pilots will monitor the aircraft performance and
      advise Air Traffic Control of any deviations from planned route or Air Traffic Control
      clearance.
      A23.3.5.3. Any crewmember or ground crew member noting a safety-of-flight
      malfunction will alert the pilot and give a brief description of the problem. The pilot will
      make the decision to continue or abort.
   A23.3.6. Approach/Landing.
      A23.3.6.1. The pilot or MC will pre-coordinate the handoff to the LRE in the mission
      briefing. Any change to handoff procedures will be briefed during the mission in a non-
      critical phase of flight. Positive exchange of aircraft control is mandatory.
      A23.3.6.2. All pilots will monitor the approach and landing and backup the PIC as
      necessary. All available links should be maintained to limit loss of communications
      (Contingency 1). Good CRM procedures are essential.
A23.4. Instrument Procedures.
   A23.4.1. Approach Category. The RQ-4 is an approach category C aircraft.
   A23.4.2. Weather Minimums.
      A23.4.2.1. The weather (TEMPO or prevailing) for RQ-4 operations at any airfield must
      be at or above a ceiling and visibility of 1000 feet and 2 miles. The weather for RQ-4
      operations must be at or above these minimums at the time of takeoff and be forecast for
      the ETA +/- 2 hours. If the arrival window forecast weather degrades below 1000 feet
      and 2 miles during the mission, RQ-4 pilots will return aircraft to their operating base
      with sufficient fuel to hold for a minimum of 2 hours (if required) then penetrate and land
      with normal recovery fuel.
      A23.4.2.2. The Global Hawk aircraft autonomously executes the planned approach and
      landing without any requirement for visual reference with the runway. For Global Hawk
      approaches, visibility minimums are observed to allow Hawkeye (SOF), or the pilot using
      the aircraft‘s nose camera, to visually verify that the aircraft is on runway centerline
      during the final stages of the approach.
   A23.4.3. Self Contained Approach Planning. All Global Hawk approaches are self
   contained. Approaches are the product of the GH Mission Planning System, and are built
   using predetermined slopes appropriate for either normal or engine out (emergency)
   operations. All approaches are constructed in compliance with local ATC restrictions and
   host nation agreements. SCA operations are routine to every flight, and as such, no requests
   are submitted through HQ or other agencies for approval.
   A23.4.4. Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA). Approaches planned on the mission planning
   system emulate precision approaches, and as such do not include MDAs.
   A23.4.5. SCA Construction. Use current DAFIF sources for all topographical, point
   obstruction, and airfield information (DAFIF and Chart Updates provided each 28 days by
   NGIA). NAVAIDs are not used in constructing the approach.
   A23.4.6. Enroute Altitudes. Descent to the first point on a Global Hawk approach is
   generally from a cruising altitude in excess of FL 600, though lower enroute descents may be
 258                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


   appropriate in some instances. The last enroute point is assigned an attribute which
   associates it with the IAF for the desired approach. Descents are normally spirals performed
   at the IAF from the operating altitude.
   A23.4.7. Obstacle Clearance: Use the published FLIP minimum and emergency safe
   altitudes for the Inner Terrain Clearance Elevation (ITCE) and Outer Terrain Clearance
   Elevation (OTCE) respectively. ITCEs and OTCEs interact with the navigation software to
   ensure that the aircraft remains above those altitudes out to the appropriate distances (25 and
   100 NM).
   A23.4.8. Global Hawk approaches fall into three categories, Standard, Missed, and Minimal,
   and are constructed as described in the next three paragraphs. An approach to any given
   runway contains at least two of these three approaches.
       A23.4.8.1. Standard Approaches are constructed as depicted in Figure A23.1. Standard
       approach glide slope is determined by the planning system based on aircraft performance
       factors at the estimated gross weight, winds, aircraft configuration and airspeed.

Figure A23.1. RQ-4 Standard Instrument Approach Construction Procedure (typical).




A23.4.8.2. Minimal Approaches are straight-in approaches which begin ten miles from the end
of the runway. They are provided with the planning system as a means of quickly building an
approach to a runway or ditch point. Glideslope values are the same as in a standard approach.
       A23.4.8.3. Missed approaches are intended to bring the aircraft around to a point at
       which the approach may be re-attempted. The last point of the missed approach is
       associated with the first point of the next approach, which may be the same as the
       original standard approach, or a shorter, modified standard approach. Values for
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                 259


      distances between optional waypoints may be selected and filled in by the planner, or not
      used. Altitudes are set into the system by the planner.
   A23.4.9. Glideslope Planning.
      A23.4.9.1. Global Hawk software plans approaches within a window of 3.5 to 8.5
      degrees.     Approaches are typically built using 4.5 degrees, and 5.25 for
      emergency/engine-out operations. Terrain clearance is included in the AFMSS function
      with the appropriate Digitized Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) loaded.
      A23.4.9.2. Mission planners will use 6-DOF simulation to select touchdown point to
      maximize runway available.
A23.5. Operating Procedures and Restrictions.
   A23.5.1. Minimum Equipment. Two communication links, at least one being a line-of-sight
   (LOS) link between the air vehicle and the CGS, are required to be up and operational prior
   to takeoff. Furthermore, RQ-4 will not exit restricted airspace without two good command
   and control links

                                        Attachment 26
                            CV-22 OPERATING PROCEDURES

A26.1. General Information. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives,
outlines procedures for operation of the CV-22 aircraft under most circumstances. It applies to
AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of all CV-22 aircraft.
Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe,
effective mission accomplishment.
   A26.1.1. Unless otherwise stated in this instruction, the CV-22 is considered a helicopter for
   the purpose of terminal area operations (takeoff, approach, and landing) or when configured
   ≥ 60 degrees nacelle. The CV-22 will be considered a fixed wing for other operations.
   A26.1.2. Except where otherwise noted, for purposes of any FAA guidance or Air Force
   Instruction, when in airplane mode follow the fixed wing rules. When flying in conversion
   mode (≥ 60 degrees nacelle) follow helicopter rules.
A26.2. Mission Planning.
   A26.2.1. Flight Planning Systems. The primary flight/mission planning system is the Special
   Operations Forces Planning and Rehearsal System (SOFPARS). SOFPARS is a subset of the
   Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS) that includes the Portable Flight Planning
   Software (PFPS) and the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS). The core mission planning
   software (PFPS or JMPS) in conjunction with V-22-specific modules and hardware
   interfaces is known as the V-22 Mission Planning System (VMPS).
   A26.2.2. Fuel Planning. For flight planning purposes, fuel requirements for descent,
   approach, and missed approach will be 1,500 pounds.
   A26.2.3. Weight and Balance. If the basic weight/moment of the aircraft is changed, a new
   DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F-Transport, will be computed. A
   new or corrected DD Form 365-4 need not be recomputed provided the initial takeoff gross
   weight (item 16) is not changed by more than 500 lbs. If the change is more than 500 lbs, the
   crew will modify the weight and balance using the cockpit management system (CMS). The
   crew will ensure CG and weight limits are not exceeded. These computations will be briefed
   during the crew, mission brief, or during flight, as required.
   A26.2.4. Weather Planning.
       A26.2.4.1. OG/CCs or equivalent may establish minimum weather criteria (ceiling or
       visibility) less than day minimums for flights during which only hovering maneuvers will
       be performed (i.e. hover checks, OCF, FCF).
       A26.2.4.2. Training Weather Minimums:
          A26.2.4.2.1. VFR Training Minimums. Comply with AFI 11-202V3, helicopter
          weather minimums unless local weather minimums are more restrictive. In the
          absence of more restrictive criteria, the following minimum weather criteria
          (ceiling/visibility) apply during all VFR training operations:
              A26.2.4.2.1.1. In CONV/VTOL mode (≥ 60 nacelle).                Under day time
              operations: Day: 500/2 SM or 700/1 Statute Mile (SM).           Under night time
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                  263


            operations: Night: Unaided: 1000/2 SM, Aided (NVG): 500/2 SM.
            A26.2.4.2.1.2. In APLN mode (< 60 nacelle). Day/Night/NVG: 1500/3 SM.
         A26.2.4.2.2. IFR Training Minimums. Comply with AFI 11-202V3 MAJCOM Sup,
         helicopter weather minimums unless local weather minimums are more restrictive.
         Instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) TF flight may be accomplished on
         published IFR Military Training Routes or other approved, surveyed training routes.
         A26.2.4.2.3. Wind Limits. Do not accomplish hovering operations during training
         when the surface wind gust spread exceeds 20 knots without an instructor pilot at a
         set of flight controls.
     A26.2.4.3. Illumination and NVG Requirements.
         A26.2.4.3.1. Any training or test missions planned when the effective illumination
         (regardless of methodology or measurement) is forecast to be less than 10 percent, or
         .8 millilux, during the mission will require an additional level of Operational Risk
         Management (ORM).
         A26.2.4.3.2. The Squadron CC/DO will be made aware of the ORM assessment and
         risk mitigation conducted for missions planned to be flown in low illumination
         conditions.
  A26.2.5. En Route Planning. Crews should fly test missions at the highest altitude
  commensurate with test requirements.
  A26.2.6. Low Level Planning. Maps with a scale of 1:500,000 or greater detail are required
  for low level operations. Maps with a scale of 1:250,000 or greater are highly desired.
     A26.2.6.1. Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA). ESA is an altitude that will provide positive
     terrain clearance in IMC during situations that require the exiting of the low-level
     environment. To compute ESA, add 1,000 feet (2,000 feet in mountainous terrain) to the
     highest obstacle or terrain feature within 10 NM of route centerline or intended flight
     path, rounded to the next 100- foot increment. Use of area ESAs is recommended
     whenever possible, however, a single ESA is sufficient when there are no significant
     changes in topography.
         A26.2.6.1.1. Failure to maintain an accurate altimeter setting during flight may cause
         lower than planned terrain clearances or impact with terrain when using the computed
         emergency safe altitude ESA/MSA.
     A26.2.6.2. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA). MSA provides terrain clearance during
     situations that require the interruption of low-level operations. To compute MSA for each
     leg or leg segment, add 500 feet (or the planned set clearance for TF operations) to the
     elevation of the highest terrain or obstacle within 3 NM of route centerline or the planned
     flight path, and round up to the next 100-foot increment.
         A26.2.6.2.1. Failure to maintain an accurate altimeter setting during flight may cause
         lower than planned terrain clearances or impact with terrain when using the computed
         emergency safe altitude ESA/MSA.
 264                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


       A26.2.6.3. Aeronautical Chart Preparation. Pilots will carry a chart on all flights and
       ensure all charts used for flight have the most current hazards posted. Aircrew will also
       ensure appropriate civil airspace is annotated along their route of flight.
       A26.2.6.4. Route Surveys. Prior to any low level operations in non-surveyed areas,
       accomplish a survey of the route or area as follows:
           A26.2.6.4.1. Conduct an extensive map study of the selected routes and areas.
           Annotate all manmade obstacles over 50 feet AGL (or the lowest altitude to be
           flown), except when below the tree line. Additionally, annotate any published low-
           level routes, avoid areas or other hazards within the boundaries. Use the Chart
           Updating Manual (CHUM) to ensure current obstacles are depicted on maps.
           A26.2.6.4.2. Fly the survey during the day. Conduct a visual search of the proposed
           route or area at the lowest applicable altitude down to a minimum altitude of 50 feet
           AGL in CONV mode or 100 feet AGL in APLN mode. Check the obstacle location
           against map location and any additional obstacles charted.
           A26.2.6.4.3. If a route or area has been inactive or flight operations have not been
           conducted at survey minimums for 12 months, re-accomplish the survey or restrict
           operations to or above the lowest level flown during the 12-month period.
   A26.2.7. Crew Complement. The crew complement for operations is specified in the flight
   manual and Table A26.1.

Notes:
1. Minimum crew is either 1 Pilot and 1 Flight Engineer or 2 Pilots.
2. Only one FE is required while operating at a location with sufficient ground crew to perform
hot refueling duties.
3. This mission category includes all basic non-tactical operations to and from
improved/approved areas (airfields, helipads, etc.) day and night. Qualified crews may use night
vision goggles (NVGs) as appropriate to improve general flight safety.
4. At the discretion of the squadron (SQ/CC), crew complement may be 2 pilots and 1 Flight
Engineer (FE). Crew complement will not be reduced if Low Visibility Approaches (LVAs) are
anticipated.
   A26.2.8. Security. CV-22 aircraft are priority C resources when they are not configured for
   special missions that require higher security priority. This security priority designation
   applies to operational aircraft worldwide. Some aircraft contain equipment and documents
   which require protection per DOD 5200.1, DOD Information Security Program/AFI 31-401,
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                    265


   Information Security Program Management. Requirements for protection of the aircraft in a
   transient status at US and foreign bases are found in DOD 5200.1 and AFI 31-401.
   A26.2.9. Arming of Crewmembers. Unit commanders may direct arming of crewmembers as
   deemed necessary by mission threat analysis. During operations where weapons are on
   board, it may be necessary to arm a weapon qualified aircrew member. Protect these weapons
   and others installed IAW AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel and
   AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons Handling Manual.
A26.3. Mission Guidance.
   A26.3.1. Landing Zones.
      A26.3.1.1. A thorough review of the landing zone survey and accompanying
      photographs or imagery will be accomplished by all crewmembers during the aircrew
      brief. The PIC is responsible for ensuring that any crewmember unable to attend the brief
      either reviews the landing zone survey or is briefed on the hazards associated with the
      LZ.
      A26.3.1.2. CV-22 aircrew will follow procedures for Helicopter Landing Zones in AFI
      13-217.
   A26.3.2. Altitude Restrictions. Except for navigation profiles flown as part of approved test
   plans or in conjunction with FCF profiles, do not operate the aircraft lower than the altitudes
   shown below.
      A26.3.2.1. Conduct all APLN mode operations at or above 300 feet AGL and
      CONV/VTOL mode operations above 100 feet AGL, except when lower altitudes are
      required for takeoff, landing, test missions, training flights in approved surveyed areas or
      routes, or while conducting a route survey under day VMC.
      A26.3.2.2. Conduct low-level sorties in mountainous terrain no lower than 300 ft
      modified contour or 200 ft set clearance plane (SCP) in airplane mode, 100 ft in CONV
      mode. In non-mountainous terrain or over water where there is a valid mission
      requirement, crews may descend to no lower than 100 feet AGL in APLN and 50 ft
      CONV. Limit the time at minimum altitudes to the duration required for mission
      accomplishment. Without an operational FLIR, lowest altitude permitted is 500 ft
      modified contour.
      A26.3.2.3. Unaided (no NVG and no TF system). Minimum en-route altitude for night
      navigation, for testing and training, is 500 feet above the highest obstacle within 3 NM
      (MSA).
      A26.3.2.4. Aided. NVGs or TF systems are the only approved methods for conducting
      night operations below 500 feet AGL. Time spent at the minimum altitude should be the
      minimum required to complete the test or complete mission proficiency training and
      night water operations.
   A26.3.3. Low Level Operations. The low level environment is defined as operations below
   500‘ AGL in APLN mode and 300‘ AGL in CONV/VTOL mode during the day. The night
   NVG low level environment is defined as operations below 1000‘ AGL in APLN mode and
   500‘ AGL in CONV/VTOL mode.

   A26.3.4. IMC Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance (TA) Training.
       A26.3.4.1. AFFSA AFSOC Waiver Vol 3/2000-1 allows IMC TF/TA operations below
       published enroute IFR minimum altitudes. Conditions and requirements of AFSOC 2000-
       1 are listed in AFI 11-202V3 MAJCOM Sup.
       A26.3.4.2. Prior to entering IMC conditions the aircrew must ensure the TF/TA radar
       and navigation systems are functioning properly.
       A26.3.4.3. Altitude Restrictions. For IMC TF/TA en-route training, the minimum
       altitude is 200 feet SCP.
       A26.3.4.4. IMC TF and flight director (FD) approach (APPR) approaches will be
       conducted to surveyed/approved landing zones along specified routes. Visual contact
       with the ground allowing confirmation of aircraft position and drift state (by someone on
       the crew) will be established prior to decelerating below 30 KGS.
       A26.3.4.5. Degraded systems training will not be conducted during IMC TF/TA
       operations.
A26.4. Instrument Procedures.
   A26.4.1. Approach Category. The CV-22 is approach category A and will adhere to
   Helicopter IFR procedures laid out in AFI 11-202V3 and AFMC Supplement.
   A26.4.2. Ceiling Below Minimums. If the reported ceiling is below minimums for the
   approach, but the visibility value is at or above the authorized minimums before initiating an
   en-route descent or published approach, ensure fuel remaining is sufficient to accomplish the
   en-route descent, approach, missed approach, and flight to alternate with appropriate
   reserves.
A26.5. Operating Procedures and Restrictions.
   A26.5.1. Aircraft Equipment
       A26.5.1.1. General. A fully mission capable aircraft is the ultimate objective of the
       logistics effort. The final responsibility regarding equipment required for a mission rests
       with the aircraft commander. If one aircraft commander accepts an aircraft to operate a
       mission or mission segment without an item or system, this acceptance does not commit
       that aircraft commander, or a different aircraft commander, to subsequent operations with
       the same item or system inoperative. When the aircraft commander considers an item
       essential, designate the component mission essential (ME) on the AFTO Form 781, and
       the item will be repaired or replaced prior to departure. This section provides guidance
       on how to operate with degraded equipment.
          A26.5.1.1.1. Radar Altimeter. The radar altimeter will be operational for night, low-
          level tactical events as well as all low-level operations over open water.
          A26.5.1.1.2. Avionics Cooling. Avionics cooling will be operational prior to
          departure. Should avionics cooling malfunction after departure, flight may be
          continued as long as airspeed is at or above 200 KCAS. Flight below 200 KCAS
          should be minimized to the maximum extent possible.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                      267


         A26.5.1.1.3. Environmental Control System (ECS). If environmental conditions
         permit, the aircraft may be flown without ECS. Crew comfort, type of mission, and
         length of mission should be considered when deciding whether or not to proceed.
         A26.5.1.1.4. Electrical Systems. If a variable frequency generator (VFG) fails at an
         en route stop, the mission may continue. Loss of a single VFG and/or converter with
         no other system failures will not adversely impact the electrical system and flight may
         be continued at the discretion of the PIC. Comply with all flight manual guidance.
         Continued operations with 1 VFG inoperative are authorized for a period not to
         exceed 35 flight hours.
         A26.5.1.1.5. Fuel Systems. Degraded operation is permissible, however, flight crews
         must consider potentially trapped fuel (center of gravity (CG) limits) and decreased
         range should further degradation occur.
             A26.5.1.1.5.1. Fuel Pumps. All suction lift pumps should be operational prior to
             departure. All boost pumps will be operational prior to departure.
             A26.5.1.1.5.2. Operations will not be conducted with any malfunction in the fuel
             system that affects the fuel quantity warning system.
         A26.5.1.1.6. Landing Gear. If a landing gear malfunction is encountered, only a full
         stop landing will be made. The discrepancy will be corrected prior to the next flight.
         Exception: If repair capability does not exist and a positive determination is made
         that further flight can be accomplished with the gear down and locked, the aircraft
         may be flown to a destination where repair capability exists provided the gear is not
         moved from the down and locked position. Required en-route stops are authorized.
         Takeoffs and landings should be minimized and made from a hover.
         A26.5.1.1.7. Navigation Systems. The aircraft will not be flown with more than one
         inertial navigation system (INS) failure as this would remove any redundancy in the
         aircraft attitude indicating system and flight control system.
         A26.5.1.1.8. Cockpit Displays. If the standby altitude indicator (AI) is inoperative,
         the aircraft may only be flown in day visual meteorological conditions (VMC)
         conditions. Flight in night VMC conditions permitted if night vision goggles (NVGs)
         are used. If any of the standby pitot-static instruments are inoperative, the aircraft will
         not be flown. Should there be degraded performance or damage to pitot-static probes
         1, 2, or 4, standby instrumentation will be affected and the aircraft will not be flown.
         As a minimum, one operating multi-function display (MFD) is required at the pilot
         and the copilot position and one operable display electronics unit (DEU) is required.
  A26.5.2. Aircrew Flight Equipment Requirements. Upon reporting to the aircraft, the PIC or
  designated representative will ensure sufficient quantities of appropriate serviceable aircre
  flight equipment, survival equipment, and protective clothing are aboard the aircraft.
  Aircrew flight equipment and medical kits below 200 lbs may be secured with seat belts.
     A26.5.2.1. Aircrew members will wear life preservers and underwater breathing devices
     on overwater flights when route of flight is beyond gliding distance of the shore.
     Passengers will have life preservers available and will be worn at the discretion of the
     Pilot in Command. Life rafts will be available to cover all personnel on board. Life rafts,
268                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


      life preservers, and helicopter emergency egress device (HEED)/Helicopter Aircrew
      Breathing Device (HABD) are not required when over-water flight occurs only for short
      distances, takeoff, approach, and before landing.
      A26.5.2.2. Survival vests will be onboard the aircraft and available to the crew for all
      flights and may be worn at the discretion of the PIC.
      A26.5.2.3. Crewmembers occupying a primary crew position should accomplish a
      communications and operations check of their oxygen masks prior to flight. This oxygen
      mask will remain connected and readily available for cockpit crewmembers and available
      for cabin crewmembers for use before engine start until after engine shutdown.
      A26.5.2.4. CV-22 crews will use rotary wing requirements for over water flight. See AFI
      11-301, MAJCOM Sup 1, for further guidance.
  A26.5.3. Flying Clothing/Safety Equipment.
      A26.5.3.1. Eye Protection.
         A26.5.3.1.1. Use protective goggles, plastic/shatter resistant lens, glasses/sunglasses,
         or the helmet visor for eye protection if duties require personnel to be in close
         proximity of the aircraft when the proprotors are turning. Wear goggles whenever
         dust, sand, dirt, etc., constitute a hazard.
         A26.5.3.1.2. During all live firing of weapons from the aircraft, ensure that all
         personnel involved in the firing of weapons wear eye protection to include one of the
         following: helmet visors, shatter resistant glasses/eye protection, safety goggles, or
         aircrew gas mask. Glass lens eyeglasses alone do not satisfy the requirement.
  A26.5.4. Maximum Flight Duty Period (FDP).
      A26.5.4.1. FCF/ACF, proficiency training, test sorties, test support sorties and tactical
      events must be completed during the first 12 hours of the FDP and are limited to a
      maximum of three sorties per day.
      A26.5.4.2. The basic FDP is 16 hours provided no tactical events, test sorties, test
      support sorties, proficiency training, Functional Check Flights (FCF) (including
      maintenance ground runs) are accomplished after 12 hours and no Aerial Refueling (AR)
      is accomplished after 14 hours. If the autopilot (coupled modes) is not fully operational
      for the required mission profile, or its use is denied for more than 4 hours, the FDP will
      be 12 hours. A fully operational autopilot is defined as a system which is capable of
      coupling course (ENAV or INAV), speed, and altitude. For the purposes of this
      paragraph, NVG terminal operations to a prepared surface are not considered tactical
      events and use of NVGs is authorized throughout the flight duty period.
      A26.5.4.3. The OG/CC or equivalent may extend FDP up to 2 hours IAW AFI11-202V3
      and AFMC Supplement.
  A26.5.5. Checklist. Accomplish all checklists with strict discipline using the challenge and
  response method as required.
  A26.5.6. Aircraft Forms/Fuel Card. Review the aircraft forms before applying power to the
  aircraft or operating aircraft systems. Ensure that the USAF fuel card and/or other authorized
  method of payment are aboard the aircraft.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                        269


  A26.5.7. Control. A qualified pilot will be at a set of flight controls at all times when
  proprotors are turning.
  A26.5.8. Crew Duties and Responsibilities.
      A26.5.8.1. Change of Aircraft Control. The change of flight controls will be
      accomplished using a positive change of controls. Use a statement which includes the
      crew position such as, ―Pilot/Copilot has controls‖ to transfer control. The other aircrew
      member will acknowledge using the crew position also such as, ―Pilot/Copilot has
      controls.‖
      A26.5.8.2. Boldface. The aircraft commander normally calls for boldface procedure
      execution. The pilot not flying should be the primary crewmember responsible for
      executing BOLDFACE and other emergency checklist procedures that involve cockpit
      switches while the pilot flying maintains aircraft control and reacts appropriately. The
      flight engineer, if in the cockpit, will confirm any switches prior to being actuated and
      will reference the checklist for guidance during the emergency. Additional crewmembers,
      if on board, should review the flight manual and assist as needed/requested.
  A26.5.9. Communications Policy.
      A26.5.9.1. Interphone Communications.
          A26.5.9.1.1. Limit intercommunication system (ICS) transmissions to those essential
          for crew coordination.
          A26.5.9.1.2. Clearance is required from the PIC prior to going off ICS.
      A26.5.9.2. The pilot operating radios will brief the crew on which radio is primary. All
      crewmembers will monitor the primary radio unless specifically directed to do otherwise
      by the PIC.
          A26.5.9.2.1. Regardless of the primary radio, monitor ultra high frequency (UHF)
          GUARD (243.0).
  A26.5.10. Aircraft Lighting. Operate aircraft lighting IAW AFI 11-202V3, MAJCOM
  supplements. Additionally, All anticollision lights will be operational for day or night
  operations. When flying in formation, only the trail aircraft is required to have a visible
  anticollision light on. In the event of failure of any light or all lights of the anticollision light
  system after takeoff, flight may be continued.
  A26.5.11. Arresting Cables. Avoid rolling over arresting cables at high speed to preclude
  damage to the bottom of the aircraft.
  A26.5.12. Proprotor Turning Offload and Onload Procedures.                 Employ the following
  procedures when engines are running:
      A26.5.12.1. Do not approach the aircraft until cleared by the crew.
      A26.5.12.2. Place one engine condition lever (ECL) in START (or reduce both ECLs),
      when practical, to reduce the proprotor downwash whenever personnel are present near
      the aircraft.
      A26.5.12.3. Personnel and equipment should approach and depart between the 4 and 8
      o‘clock position during engine running ground operations. When using the crew door,
270                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


      approach and depart from the nose of the aircraft as much as possible to stay in the pilot‘s
      field of view until clear of the aircraft. Avoid the regions directly outboard of the nacelles
      (3 and 9 o‘clock) due to engine exhaust deflected by the coanda system.
  A26.5.13. Oxygen Requirements. Comply with AFI 11-202V3, for unpressurized aircraft.
  A26.5.14. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations.
      A26.5.14.1. Conduct hot refueling IAW AFI 11-235, Forward Area Refueling Point
      (FARP) Operations, TO 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static
      Grounding/Bonding, and appropriate flight manuals. The guidance in this section
      supplements the procedures outlined in TO 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and
      Static Grounding/Bonding, appropriate flight manuals, and checklist.
      A26.5.14.2. Transmissions on other than line of sight (LOS) radios are prohibited.
      A26.5.14.3. Aircrew will not wear Gortex garments within 50 feet of the aircraft when
      refueling with JP-4 or Jet B.
      A26.5.14.4. Personnel not directly involved in refueling operations will remain clear by
      a minimum of 50 feet.
      A26.5.14.5. In the absence of qualified maintenance personnel, aircrew may service
      aircraft hydraulic and oil systems IAW the flight manual.
  A26.5.15. Forced or Precautionary Landings. If the crew becomes doubtful of the aircraft‘s
  airworthiness or encounters hazardous weather conditions preventing further flight, they
  should execute a precautionary landing, provided the landing conditions are not more
  hazardous than the in-flight problem. Report all precautionary landings through the
  appropriate chain of command as soon as communications are established.
  A26.5.16. Radar Altimeter Procedures.
      A26.5.16.1. During low-level operations, the recommended low altitude warning setting
      is 80 percent of intended cruise altitude.
      A26.5.16.2. For instrument approaches, set the radar altimeter low altitude warning to
      the appropriate height above touchdown (HAT) or height above aerodrome (HAA) prior
      to the final approach fix (FAF).
  A26.5.17. Radar Advisories. Participate to the maximum extent possible while operating in
  VFR or simulated IFR conditions.
  A26.5.18. Power Checks.
      A26.5.18.1. Aircrew will reconfirm power requirements using either the cockpit
      management system (CMS) or performance charts when power required is within ten
      (10) percent of power available.
      A26.5.18.2. Takeoff and landing will be executed utilizing interim power at the pilot‘s
      discretion. For tactical approaches to and from LZs, interim power will be used.
  A26.5.19. Personnel Restraints.
      A26.5.19.1. Aircrew. At least one pilot will have seat belt and shoulder harness fastened
      when engines are running. Crewmembers may perform duties that require them to be
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                  271


     unrestrained for short periods of time, provided they are not in close proximity to an open
     door.
     A26.5.19.2. Except for primary and additional aircrew all cabin occupants must be
     seated with seat belts fastened during taxi, initial takeoff, and initial approach and
     landing.
  A26.5.20. Power Required for Tactical Terminal Operations Training.
     A26.5.20.1. Clear escape route – out of ground effect (OGE) hover power.
     A26.5.20.2. Restricted escape route – OGE hover power plus 10 percent.
  A26.5.21. Obstacle Clearance for Tactical Terminal Operations Training. Horizontal
  obstacle clearance will be no less than 25 feet from the proprotor tip path plane. Shipboard
  operations to marked spot cleared for V-22 may be conducted with less clearance.
  A26.5.22. Flare and Chaff Policy. Dispense flares IAW controlling agency procedures and
  restrictions. When over water, dispense flares at least 3 NM from any surface vessel,
  platform, or landmass. Upon next landing, deplane a crewmember to visually inspect
  dispensers to ensure that there are no hung flares. If a hung flare is detected, follow
  appropriate procedures.
  A26.5.23. Simulated Instrument Flight. The use of a hood or other artificial vision-
  restricting device is not authorized for any phase of flight unless IAW approved test plan.
  A26.5.24. Emergency Procedures. Emergency procedures are normally practiced in the
  aircrew training device (ATD). Do not retard ECL‘s or fail any aircraft systems, except as
  required during FCF‘s.
  A26.5.25. Mission Employment. Refer to CV-22 CONOPS Annex C as appropriate.
  A26.5.26. Direct Support Operator Procedures. Refer to CV-22 CONOPS Annex C as
  appropriate.

                                       Attachment 27
                           MQ-1/9 OPERATING PROCEDURES

A27.1. General Information.
   A27.1.1. Scope. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives, outlines
   procedures for the operation of the MQ-1/MQ-9 Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) under most
   circumstances. It applies to all aircrew operating AFMC MQ-1/MQ-9 aircraft. Operations
   or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe, effective
   mission accomplishment.
A27.2. Mission Planning.
   A27.2.1. Mission Planning Requirements. The PIC is responsible for mission planning and
   briefing. Mission planning and briefing are two separate activities. The PIC and mission
   planners (if available) will jointly review mission plans to ensure safety and mission
   effectiveness. Crewmembers other than the crew flying the mission may accomplish mission
   planning. Commanders will ensure currency of all mission planning materials and
   compliance with command guidance. Squadron and Forward Operating Location operations
   officers will schedule adequate mission planning time prior to flight.
   A27.2.2. Inflight Publications. FLIP terminal instrument procedure books are not required
   in the GCS except when operating from an airfield with a published MQ-1/MQ-9 compatible
   approach. If the MQ-1/MQ-9 compatible approaches are separately published plates, then
   only those plates are required in the GCS. If units annotate the ground track from compatible
   MQ-1/MQ-9 approach plates on the PSO Tracker display chart, it will be to scale and reflect
   current FLIP products. When operating away from El Mirage or Gray Butte Airfields a taxi
   diagram will be loaded in both PSO racks or in the GCS for the aircrew to reference.
   A27.2.3. Local Area Maps And Inflight Guides. A local area map of sufficient detail to
   remain within assigned operational or training areas will be available to crewmembers and
   displayed in the GCS. Units will ensure that, as a minimum, the PSO racks contain charts
   that are accurate enough to ensure the safe operation of the aircraft. Maps, charts, and FLIP
   required for navigation for both the planned IFR and VFR phases of flight shall be available
   to the aircrew at all times.
   A27.2.4. Briefing/De-briefing
       A27.2.4.1. The PIC is responsible for presenting a logical briefing to all crewmembers
       that promotes safe, effective mission accomplishment. A structured, logical debrief of
       the flight shall be conducted at the completion of each mission.
       A27.2.4.2. Briefing Attendees. Crewmembers who are logging individual events for
       currency do not need to attend the mission briefing iaw Chapter 2, however, they must
       receive a changeover brief in their respective crew position before participating in the
       flight. Other crewmembers who did not attend a mission briefing must obtain Squadron
       Operations Officer (SQ/DO) approval prior to participating in a flight. The pilot in
       command or MC will ensure crewmembers participating in a flight under SQ/DO
       approval are adequately briefed prior to assuming crew duties.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                        273


      A27.2.4.3. Brief Content. A Go/No-Go and Operational Risk Management (ORM)
      checklist will be completed by the PIC with all crewmembers available. The extent and
      depth of the briefings will depend on the type of flight, complexity of the tests and
      equipment, previous mission and flight crew experience. Those items published in unit
      standards and understood by all participants may be briefed as ―standard.‖ Mission
      briefings will be accomplished IAW Mission Briefing Guides contained within the unit
      In-Flight Guides.
          A27.2.4.3.1. In-flight Changes. Do not fly unbriefed missions and/or events. If
          operationally necessary, mission elements and events may be modified while the MQ-
          1/MQ-9 is airborne as long as changes do not compromise flight safety. The PIC will
          ensure all crewmembers understand any changes.
      A27.2.4.4. Crew Change/Handover Brief. When conducting handover operations the
      LRE and MCE pilots should carefully plan and coordinate handover locations, times, and
      other mission pertinent information. Emphasis should be placed on notifying the other
      element of current mission status, mission accomplishment, items not accomplished, and
      any deviations from previously coordinated operations.
   A27.2.5. Crew. The crew is defined as the personnel responsible for safe operation of the
   MQ-1/MQ-9 aircraft. For the MQ-1/MQ-9, the term pilot refers to a pilot in the LRE or
   MCE or to the Mission Commander (MCC).
      A27.2.5.1. Pilot-in-command (PIC). The PIC will be designated in the flight
      authorization IAW AFI 11-401. For multiple crews, the PIC will be designated for each
      crew.
      A27.2.5.2. Pilot/Sensor Operator (PSO) racks. For normal ground and flight operations,
      the pilot in control of the aircraft will occupy the left seat unless equipment malfunctions
      dictate use of an alternate control rack. In addition, during critical phases of flight, a pilot
      or sensor operator must be in the right seat. The crewmember in the right seat will act as
      a safety monitor while operating the Multi-Spectral Targeting System (MTS) to ensure
      the safety of the aircraft and ground personnel.
   A27.2.6. Flight Plan. When required by the FAA CoA, the PIC or delegated shall file a
   flight plan prior to flight. A flight plan may not be required due to the unique nature of RPA
   operations. The PIC‘s initials on the Flight Authorization (AF IMT 4327a) cover the
   requirements stipulated in AFI 11-202V3.
A27.3. Common Mission Guidance.
   A27.3.1. Ground Control Station (GCS).
      A27.3.1.1. Entry Procedures. The GCS will be considered the flight deck of the aircraft
      under operation with no exceptions.
      A27.3.1.2. At the beginning of every flight, the PIC will display the appropriate access
      signs on the GCS entry points.
      A27.3.1.3. For GCS entry procedures, critical phases of flight will be defined as: takeoff
      to initial climb configuration; final approach to touchdown (or low approach); LRE to
      MCE (and vice versa) handover operations; medium or high risk test point execution, and
      terminal attack sequences (maneuver-to-attack to weapons impact).
274                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


      A27.3.1.4. During critical phases of flight and any other time determined by the pilot in
      command keep a sterile environment consistent with good CRM procedures. The
      technician will post an access sign instructing personnel to call for entry. During an
      emergency situation, requested personnel can enter the rear door without calling. Exit
      from the GCS through the rear door. If no rear exit is available, coordinate with the PIC
      prior to exiting. Talking should be minimized and only if necessary for the execution of
      the mission in the GCS, especially when the aircraft is below 2000‘ AGL.
      A27.3.1.5. During all phases of flight there will be no entry or exit through the forward
      door, unless the GCS does not have an aft door. Aircrew will not answer pages in the
      GCS and the PA system should be turned down in volume. The PA can be used to
      declare an IFE or call a Code Red or Yellow. If crewmembers are unable to answer the
      phone, a technician may answer and ask the crew if they are able to take the call. The
      PIC has final authority on number of personnel in the GCS. The PIC can designate the
      technician to limit the nonessential personnel within the GCS.
      A27.3.1.6. Limitations/Restrictions. While in the GCS, crewmembers will operate only
      those electronic items necessary for flight and/or mission operations.
      A27.3.1.7. Telephone usage is authorized in the GCS while the RPA is in flight.
      A27.3.1.8. Smoking is prohibited in or within 50 feet of the GCS.
  A27.3.2. Required Equipment.
      A27.3.2.1. Video Sources. Two separate video sources are required for flight operations.
      At least one nose camera, either EO or IR, must be available.
      A27.3.2.2. Navigation Equipment. The inertial navigation system (INS) and global
      positioning systems (GPS) are required for flight operations.
      A27.3.2.3. Transponder. The aircraft shall have an operable transponder with altitude
      encoding for all flights, unless the PIC has contacted the controlling facility and been
      given permission to fly without it. The PIC should get the name and phone number of the
      individual at the controlling facility granting permission to fly the mission.
      A27.3.2.4. Sensor Equipment at Night. A minimum of one IR sensor must be
      operational for any mission with planned operations between the hours of official sunset
      and official sunrise.
      A27.3.2.5. Data Recording. New recording media (VCR tape, RDVD, etc.) shall be
      installed prior to each ground run or flight operation.
      A27.3.2.6. Ground Crew Communication. Two way communications are required
      between the pilot and ground crew during all ground operations and airborne operations
      that require ground crew participation.
  A27.3.3. Engine Starts. The engine will only be started on the command of the pilot.
  A27.3.4. Taxi Operations.
      A27.3.4.1. Maintain safe taxi speeds at all times. Maximum taxi speed is 20 knots
      ground speed on taxiways and runways. Maximum taxi speed is 5 knots ground speed in
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                   275


     turns. Crews are allowed to perform high speed brake checks up to 35 knots ground
     speed or airspeed as the test mission dictates.
     A27.3.4.2. Do not taxi over arresting gear (i.e. BAK 9/12 or BAK-14).
     A27.3.4.3. Prior to arm/de-arm, pilots will notify the ground crew that hands are clear of
     all aircraft controls.
  A27.3.5. Takeoff/Departure.
     A27.3.5.1. Do not takeoff, land or accomplish touch-and-go landings over raised
     webbing-type barriers (e.g., MA-1A, 61QSII). Pilots may takeoff, land or accomplish
     touch-and-go landings before, beyond or between raised cables or barriers provided the
     available distance meets minimum runway length requirements.
     A27.3.5.2. Command the MTS to position mode whenever below 500‘ AGL. Above
     500‘ AGL and with pilot concurrence, the sensor operator may use the MTS at their
     discretion.
     A27.3.5.3. Maintain an engine-out glideback capability to the maximum extent possible.
     A27.3.5.4. For initial takeoffs on test sorties, with safety and test review board approval,
     the available runway for landing must exceed total planned landing distance by at least
     500 feet. This is meant to apply to emergency heavy weight landings that occur
     immediately after takeoff. Attempt to dump fuel or jettison ordnance to reduce gross
     weight and landing distance. In all other cases, landings will be planned so that the
     available runway exceeds landing distance by at least 1000 feet.
  A27.3.6. Ops Checks.
     A27.3.6.1. Accomplish sufficient ops checks to ensure safe mission execution. Time
     between ops checks will not exceed one hour.
     A27.3.6.2. Minimum items to check are: communication links, engine instruments, total
     fuel quantity and distribution, current feeding fuel tank, and aircraft weight.
  A27.3.7. Enroute. PICs shall maintain normal VFR/IFR separation utilizing chase aircraft
  and two way radio communications with a controlling agency. If flying within the National
  Airspace System (NAS), the PIC will request flight following from ATC as much as
  possible.
  A27.3.8. Recovery. The normal procedure is to bring the RPA into visual range of the
  ground crew. Once the ground crew can maintain visual on the RPA and it is within the CoA
  limits for distance away from the observer, the aircrew may clear the chase aircraft off by
  stating ―CLEARED OFF‖. Once cleared off, chase will either leave the area of operations or
  orbit south of the field and land after the runway is clear.
  A27.3.9. Approach and Landing.
     A27.3.9.1. Stabilized Approach. Stabilized approach is defined as payload in position
     mode, configured for landing, normal glidepath, and on target airspeed (minus 5 KIAS
     and plus 15 KIAS). Aircraft must be stabilized by 200 feet AGL. If the aircraft becomes
     un-stabilized below 200 feet AGL, or if the following sink rate limits are exceeded, a go
     around is mandatory. Sink rate limits: 1200 feet per minute (FPM) descent rate below
276                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


      200 feet AGL and 600 FPM below 50 feet AGL. Momentary deviations do not require a
      go around as long as immediate corrective actions are taken.
      A27.3.9.2. The desired touchdown zone for a visual approach is 500 to 1500 feet from
      the threshold, or the glide path interception point for a precision approach. When local
      procedures or unique runway surface conditions require landing beyond a given point on
      the runway, adjust the desired touchdown zone accordingly and brief applicable
      crewmembers.
      A27.3.9.3. During a go-around or low approach, do not fly directly over aircraft on the
      runway at low altitude.
      A27.3.9.4. Comply with the wake turbulence avoidance criteria for a small aircraft
      (category 1).
      A27.3.9.5. Pilots will not practice EO nose-camera landings at night.
      A27.3.9.6. The crewmember in the right seat will announce altitude deviations (plus or
      minus) exceeding 100 feet at the initial approach fix and the final approach fix. The
      crewmember in the right seat will announce ―DECISION HEIGHT‖ or ―MDA‖
      (Minimum Descent Altitude) when reaching these altitudes for precision and non-
      precision approaches.
      A27.3.9.7. For MQ-9 landings using beta range (full reverse), the pilot will call ―Full
      Reverse‖ after he pulls the power lever into reverse. The right seat crew member will
      call "Full Reverse" after he confirms the pilot‘s action. The right seat crew member will
      call ground speeds as the aircraft decelerates in 10 knot increments (60 kts, 50 kts, 40 kts,
      30 kts) then call out the directive: "Ground Idle". The pilot will call "Ground Idle" after
      moving the power lever to ground Idle. The right seat crew member will again verify the
      pilot‘s action.
  A27.3.10. Simulated Flame Out (SFO) procedures. Minimum airspeed during an SFO
  traffic pattern is Max Endurance airspeed. Landings (touch-and-go or full-stop) may be
  accomplished out of an SFO, provided an IP is present, the approach is stabilized and the
  aircraft will land in the recommended touchdown zone. Terminate the SFO maneuver if
  airspeed decreases below the minimum stated or at 100 feet AGL if the aircraft will land
  short of the runway threshold.
  A27.3.11. Air-to-Surface Weapons Delivery
      A27.3.11.1. Battle Damage/Weapons Checks. Crews will perform battle damage and
      weapons checks prior to or during RTB. This check is mandatory following expenditure
      of live ordnance. If unable to complete the check using organic sensors, request support
      from the chase aircraft or a ground observer before landing.
      A27.3.11.2. Captive-carry Ordnance Procedures. If carrying training ordnance, aircrew
      can arm the master arm switch and actuate all appropriate buttons. Pinned up live or inert
      weapons are not considered training ordnance.
  A27.3.12. Chase Operations.
      A27.3.12.1. Chase Crew Requirements. Two pilots are required for night chase
      operations. The safety pilot (pilot not flying) is responsible for clearing for traffic while
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                    277


     the pilot flying is responsible for maintaining aircraft control and visual separation with
     the RPA. Two pilots are also required when oxygen is required by FAA regulations. A
     single pilot may be used in day chase missions.
     A27.3.12.2. It is the chase aircraft‘s responsibility to advise the RPA aircrew if the flight
     path indicates a possible conflict with other aircraft or weather. Two-way radio
     communication will be maintained between the chase aircraft and the RPA. If there has
     been no communication between the chase aircraft and the RPA in the last 15 minutes, a
     radio check between the two aircraft will be accomplished.
     A27.3.12.3. Weather Minimums. Chase operations will be conducted in VMC. For
     rejoins underneath a ceiling, minimum ceiling/visibility criteria are 1000 feet/3 NM for
     day, 3000 feet/3 NM for night.
     A27.3.12.4. Altitude Minimums. Chase aircraft will not go below 500 feet AGL during
     chase procedures in day/VMC conditions. Chase aircraft will not go below minimum
     safe altitude (MSA) during chase procedures at night. MSA is defined as 1000 feet above
     the highest obstacle in the defined testing/training area and will be briefed on every
     mission. (Recommend the MSA be based on a 5 NM radius from the RPA.)
     A27.3.12.5. Distance Minimums. Chase aircraft will maintain 300 feet to 1500 feet of
     separation from the RPA. Chase aircraft should maintain a slight stack and 2 to 5 aspect
     on the RPA.
     A27.3.12.6. Equipment Procedures. The chase aircraft and the RPA will have their
     beacons and strobe lights on during daylight operations to increase visibility for other
     aircraft.
     A27.3.12.7. The RPA will squawk the transponder code for the formation. The chase
     aircraft will squawk standby and be ready to squawk for the formation in the event the
     RPA‘s transponder fails.
     A27.3.12.8. The chase crew will call ―READY FOR REJOIN‖ when in position and
     visual the RPA. Additionally, the chase crew will report all gear up and gear down
     positions.
     A27.3.12.9. The RPA will call all turns at night or in close formation, as well as all
     altitude and airspeed changes.
  A27.3.13. Lost Communication.
     A27.3.13.1. RPA Lost Communication. If the chase aircraft detects the RPA is lost
     comm, the chase crew will contact the RPA ops desk and direct the RPA to recover to the
     local area. If the RPA does not recover, chase crew will provide ATC with the actual
     position and probable destination of the RPA. If the chase aircraft cannot safely continue
     to execute chase responsibilities (maintain VMC, chase low on fuel, a potential threat of a
     collision exists, etc.), the chase aircraft will proceed to and loiter, well clear of the
     landing runway. If radio communications are regained, chase aircraft will request to
     rejoin. Otherwise, the chase aircraft will return to base (RTB).
     A27.3.13.2. Chase Aircraft Lost Communication.           If the RPA crew detects a
     communication failure with the chase aircraft, the RPA crew will RTB.

   A27.3.14. Loss of Visual Contact. If the chase aircraft loses visual contact with the RPA,
   immediate separation is essential. Upon losing sight of the RPA, the chase aircraft will call
   ―BLIND‖ with altitude over the radio. The RPA will acknowledge the blind call and
   immediately transmit heading, altitude, and airspeed. The RPA will remain predictable and
   continue its current flight path unless directed otherwise. The sensor operator will utilize the
   MTS (if available) in an attempt to clear the RPA flight path and avoid a collision. The
   chase aircraft will obtain a minimum of 500 feet altitude separation until visual contact is
   regained. If visual contact is lost for more than 30 seconds, chase aircraft will request
   assistance from ATC to reacquire the visual. While the chase aircraft is visually searching,
   the RPA will make position reports and call turns.
   A27.3.15. Encountering IMC. The chase aircraft should be directive to avoid IMC
   penetration; however, if an inadvertent IMC penetration occurs resulting in loss of visual,
   immediate separation from the RPA is essential. Smooth application of control inputs is
   imperative to minimize the effects of spatial disorientation. The chase aircraft will
   simultaneously transition to instruments, maneuver away from the last known RPA position,
   and call ―BLIND, POPEYE‖ over the radio. The RPA aircrew will acknowledge the blind
   call and immediately transmit heading, altitude, and airspeed. The RPA will remain
   predictable and maintain its current flight path unless directed otherwise. The sensor
   operator will utilize the MTS (if available) to clear the RPA‘s flight path. The chase aircraft
   will obtain a minimum of 500 feet altitude separation until visual contact is regained. If
   visual contact is lost for more than 30 seconds, chase aircraft will request assistance from
   ATC to reacquire the visual. While the chase aircraft is visually searching, the RPA aircrew
   will make position reports and call turns. The chase aircraft and the RPA will coordinate
   separate ATC clearances to ensure separation with each other as well as other aircraft (IFR
   clearance, squawk, etc). Once clear of IMC and visual the chase aircraft will request rejoin
   with the RPA.
   A27.3.16. Chase Rejoins.
       A27.3.16.1. Takeoff. This is the preferred method of rejoin. Chase aircraft will
       normally takeoff prior to the RPA, loiter south of the field and call ―READY FOR
       REJOIN‖ on the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF) or other pre-briefed
       frequency. The RPA aircrew will announce takeoff on the CTAF. Chase aircraft will
       keep the RPA in sight, climb with it, and plan to rejoin by 2000 feet AGL. Chase aircraft
       will not go below final approach speed during rejoin.
       A27.3.16.2. In-flight. If the RPA is airborne prior to the chase aircraft‘s arrival, the chase
       aircraft will remain south of the runway environment until visual. The RPA will assist
       the rejoin by stating the RPA‘s location, heading, airspeed and altitude. Once visual, the
       chase aircraft will request to rejoin.
A27.4. Instrument Procedures.
   A27.4.1. The MQ-1 is an approach category A aircraft. The MQ-9 is an approach category
   B aircraft.
   A27.4.2. Weather Minimums, Restrictions, and Planning Factors. The MQ-1/MQ-9 are
   weather category 1 aircraft.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                     279


      A27.4.2.1. All flights at El Mirage and Gray Butte Airfields shall be conducted under
      VFR conditions throughout the planned route of flight (1500 feet ceiling, 3 SM visibility,
      +/- 1 hr ETA). Pilots will maneuver the aircraft so as to maintain appropriate VFR cloud
      clearances during departure, en-route, and recovery IAW AFI 11-202V3. The following
      sources shall be utilized in determining weather conditions: airport control tower, regular
      and special weather reports obtained through DUATS (if available), Flight Service
      Station, Military Weather Services, commercial pilot reports and GCS installed weather
      systems.
      A27.4.2.2. Operating the MQ-1/MQ-9 with ceiling and/or visibility below VFR
      minimums requires a published airport surveillance radar or precision approach radar
      terminal approach procedure at the operating airfield. The MQ-1/MQ-9 INS/GPS is not
      certified for flying GPS instrument approaches.
      A27.4.2.3. Normally, declaring an alternate airfield is not an available option for the
      MQ-1/MQ-9 unless the airfield has a pre-positioned GCS (or LRGCS). If a pre-
      positioned GCS is available, use published alternate weather requirements IAW AFI 11-
      202V3. Holding (instead of an alternate airport) is authorized for RPA operations. While
      airborne, if the actual weather deteriorates below 1500 feet ceiling or the visibility is
      below 3 SM, MQ-1/MQ-9 crewmembers will increase recovery fuel to allow the aircraft
      to hold for at least one hour, in addition to, normal recovery fuel.
A27.5. Operating Procedures and Restrictions.
   A27.5.1. Wind. Actual winds must be within flight manual limits at takeoff and landing. If
   forecast winds exceed flight manual limits at ETA, the RPA must return to the local area one
   hour prior to the forecasted winds exceeding limits. If unable to land prior to the increased
   winds, terminate the mission in time to return to the airfield with sufficient fuel for at least
   two hours of low approaches in addition to normal recovery fuel. For cross-country sorties,
   winds must be forecast within limits for +/- 1 hour of ETA.
   A27.5.2. Thunderstorms and Lightning. Lightning strikes and electrostatic discharges can
   occur in what may look like benign conditions. All flight and ground operations are
   prohibited when lightning is reported within five (5) nautical miles of the airfield. All
   ground operations are prohibited if thunderstorms are producing hazardous conditions such
   as hail, strong winds above 30 knots, heavy rain or lightning.
   A27.5.3. Cold-Weather Operating Procedures. Do not takeoff with frost, ice or snow
   accumulation on the wings. Whenever the outside air temperature is less than 40 degrees
   Fahrenheit or the pilot is concerned about frost, ice or snow, apply an ice retardant to the
   wings or inspect the aircraft for frost immediately prior to takeoff. Pilots should avoid
   penetration of visible moisture or precipitation to the maximum extent possible, particularly
   above the freezing level. If precipitation cannot be avoided, pilots should maximize climb or
   descent rate to exit potential or actual icing conditions.
      A27.5.3.1. Icing Procedures. Do not conduct flight into forecast icing greater than light.
      Do not conduct flight into known icing conditions. If encountering icing in flight, take
      action to exit icing conditions immediately.
   A27.5.4. Runway/Taxiway Conditions. When no RCR is available, refer to International
   Civil Aviation Organization conversions in the Flight Information Handbook. Handling
280                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


  characteristics of the MQ-1/MQ-9 on ice or snow are not optimum. Minimize power settings
  to limit taxi speed to no more than 5 KGS. If required to stop, try to stop over clear portions
  of the taxiway. The pilot will remain focused on the outside video display at all times.
  A27.5.5. Emergency Mission Planning. Maintain awareness of current and forecast weather
  along the planned and emergency mission routes of flight, and at the intended landing field.
  Update the emergency mission route for weather hazards (e.g., cloud layers, icing,
  turbulence, etc.) throughout the flight. Alter the route, if necessary, and use care to select
  appropriate aircraft parameters to avoid hazardous weather conditions.

                       DHC-8-Q200/Q300 OPERATING PROCEDURES

A29.1. General Information. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives,
outlines procedures for operation of the DHC-8 (Dash 8) Series 200 and 300 aircraft under most
circumstances. It applies to AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with
operation of DHC-8 aircraft. Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be
accomplished if they enhance safe, effective mission accomplishment.
A29.2. Mission Planning.
   A29.2.1. Aircrew.
       A29.2.1.1. Minimum Crew for Flight. The minimum crew for the DHC-8 is a pilot
       (aircraft commander) and copilot for high-speed taxi and flight operations.
       A29.2.1.2. Supplemental Crew. Additional crew may include sensor operators and/or
       observers.
A29.3. Common Mission Guidance.
   A29.3.1. Minimum Air Work Altitude. Unusual attitudes, stalls, steep turns, and flight at
   minimum control airspeed will be accomplished clear of clouds and at or above 5,000 feet
   AGL.
   A29.3.2. Single Engine Simulation. To simulate an engine out situation, retard the
   appropriate power lever to 20 percent torque (at not less than VMCA nor less than 200 feet
   AGL).
A29.4. Instrument Procedures.
   A29.4.1. The DHC-8 is approach category B.
   A29.4.2. CNS/ATM Limitations. Navigation capability limitations are as stated in the Pilot‘s
   Operating Handbook and any Supplements for the aircraft flown.
A29.5. Operating Procedures and Restrictions.
   A29.5.1. Reverse Taxi. The reverse taxi capability of the DASH 8 will not be utilized,
   except in an emergency, or as part of a test plan. If the aircraft must be reversed, follow
   procedures in the Flight Manual and use a safety observer outside the aircraft, in full view of
   the pilots. Hand signals will be pre-briefed.
   A29.5.2. Runway and Taxiway Minimums.
       A29.5.2.1. The aircraft commander will determine that all airfield facilities are of
       suitable construction, and weight bearing capacity.
       A29.5.2.2. Minimum Runway Length for Takeoff. For takeoff, runway available must
       exceed computed takeoff field length corrected for Runway Condition Reading (RCR) or
       3,000 feet whichever is greater. The decision to make intersection takeoffs rests solely
       with the PIC.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                               283


     A29.5.2.3. Minimum Runway Length for Landing. For landing, runway available must
     exceed computed landing distance without reverse over a 50 foot obstacle corrected for
     RCR or 3,000 feet whichever is greater.
     A29.5.2.4. Minimum Runway Length for Touch and Goes. Touch-and-go landings are
     authorized on runways of 6,000 ft or more. If the planned landing runway has arresting
     gear, there must be at least 6,000 ft between cables.
  A29.5.3. Arresting Gear. Taxiing or landing over arresting gear or cables is not authorized
  due to restricted clearance of the radar dome and EO/IR pod. Plan to touch down beyond and
  takeoff prior to arresting gear.

              PC-12/U-28 (AND VARIANTS) OPERATING PROCEDURES

A30.1. General Information. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives,
outlines procedures for operation of the U-28/PC-12 aircraft and U-28/PC-12 modified aircraft. .
It applies to AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of U-28/PC-12
aircraft. Operations not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe,
effective mission accomplishment.
A30.2. Mission Planning.
   A30.2.1. Fuel Requirements. Plan an additional 15 minutes of fuel per hour at Maximum
   Cruise Power fuel consumption rates for that portion of the flight where structural icing or
   thunderstorms requiring off-course maneuvering are forecast or reported.
   A30.2.2. Flight Logs.
       A30.2.2.1. Prepare a flight log for each off-station mission and include the following as a
       minimum: turn points, headings, distances, Estimated Time Enroute (ETE), Minimum
       Safe Altitude (MSA) (for low-level operations), and fuel computations. A flight log is not
       required if the above information is included on a flight map
       A30.2.2.2. A flight log is not required for flights within 2.5 hours of home station. It is
       the responsibility of the aircraft commander to brief fuel requirements and meet the
       minimum fuel requirements of Table 2.1.
   A30.2.3. Departure Planning. Use AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217 and this instruction
   when planning an IFR departure.
       A30.2.3.1. IFR Departures.
           A30.2.3.1.1. Takeoff gross weight (GW) must not exceed that which would lower the
           rate of climb to less than a 3.3 percent climb gradient (200ft/NM).
           A30.2.3.1.2. If no minimum climb gradient is published, use 200 ft/NM. Review
           AFMAN 11-217 for further guidance.
       A30.2.3.2. VFR Departures will not be flown in lieu of proper obstacle clearance
       planning. VFR departures require detailed planning to ensure obstacles and high terrain
       are avoided.
A30.3. Common Mission Guidance.
   A30.3.1. Crew Complement. Minimum crew for the U-28/PC-12 is one U-28/PC-12
   qualified pilot. In addition to the qualified pilot, a second qualified pilot or instrument rated
   safety pilot is required if other crewmembers are on board. Crew complement for the U-
   28/PC-12 is IAW Table A30.1.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                     285

       A30.3.1.1. Non-current or unqualified crewmembers may perform in their primary crew
       position when supervised by an instructor of like specialty. For pilots, the instructor must
       occupy the other pilot seat.
   A30.3.2. Safety Belts, Shoulder Harnesses.
       A30.3.2.1. The aircraft commander will ensure crewmembers and passengers have safety
       belts securely fastened during takeoffs, approaches, landings, simulated emergencies, and
       when turbulence is encountered or anticipated.
       A30.3.2.2. When occupying their crew position, the pilot and copilot will have safety
       belts fastened at all times, and safety belts with shoulder harnesses fastened for taxi,
       takeoff, approach and landing.
   A30.3.3. Runway and Taxiway Minimums.
       A30.3.3.1. The aircraft commander will determine that all airfield facilities are of
       suitable construction, and weight bearing capacity.
       A30.3.3.2. Minimum Takeoff Runway. The Accelerate-Stop Distance must be less than
       80% of usable runway available.
       A30.3.3.3. Minimum Landing Runway. The computed Landing Distance must be less
       than 80% of useable runway (without propeller reverse).
       A30.3.3.4. Operations from other than hard surfaced runways are not authorized.
   A30.3.4. Take-off/Landing Procedures.
       A30.3.4.1. Only qualified U-28/PC-12 pilots will conduct the takeoff and landing unless
       the other pilot is a U-28/PC-12 instructor. Either pilot can taxi the airplane onto the
       runway for take-off.
       A30.3.4.2. Crosswind for Takeoff and Landings. Table A30.2 will be used to determine
       the recommended maximum crosswind component for takeoffs or landings. The pilot‘s
       operating handbook does not introduce RCR into performance factors for takeoff or
       landing.

  A30.3.5. Touch-and-Go/Stop-and-go Landings.
      A30.3.5.1. Conduct touch and go operations IAW the PC-12/U-28 Checklists. Touch-
      and-Go operations require two qualified pilots or an IP if the other pilot is unqualified or
      non-current.
      A30.3.5.2. The Touch-and-Go Checklists may be used when performing multiple
      instrument approaches or VFR pattern practice at the same airport or transitioning to
      another airport within 25 NM. Pilots will complete the Climb, Cruise, Descent, and
      Before Landing Checklists after the initial takeoff or if transiting to another airfield
      greater than 25 NM from the airport where instrument-approach or VFR-pattern practice
      was accomplished.
      A30.3.5.3. When the runway surface is reported as wet and crosswinds exceed 75% of
      the maximum demonstrated crosswinds listed in the Pilot Operating Handbook (POH),
      Stop-and-Go or Touch-and-Go operations are prohibited.
      A30.3.5.4. Stop-and-Go or Touch-and-Go operations are prohibited on icy or snow-
      polluted runways.
  A30.3.6. Minimum runway length for touch and go operations is 5,000 feet for full and
  partial flap landings and 6,000 feet for no-flap landings.
  A30.3.7. Stop and go landings are authorized if the Accelerate-Stop Distance is less than
  80% of usable runway available. Stop-and-go landings will not be accomplished unless a
  minimum of 2400 RVR, or ½ SM mile (if RVR is unavailable) and useable runway length is
  not less than 80% of Accelerate-Stop distance.
  A30.3.8. Touch-and-Go Landings are authorized when ceiling and visibility range are better
  than 300 and ¾.
  A30.3.9. Aircraft Loading/Cargo Handling. Ensure a weight and balance computation is
  accomplished prior to each flight. Use of spreadsheet products is acceptable, provided all
  weights and moments are properly accounted for by flight station.
  A30.3.10. Taxi. All aircraft doors will be closed during taxi operations.
  A30.3.11. Flap Setting. Takeoff flap setting will be 15 degrees. Takeoff flap setting of 30
  degrees is permissible, provided the procedure is briefed by the pilot.
  A30.3.12. Oxygen Requirements. Oxygen will be used as prescribed in AFI 11-
  202V3/AFMC Sup 1 or the flight manual, whichever is more restrictive.
  A30.3.13. Communications Policy.
      A30.3.13.1. Sterile Cockpit. Limit conversation to that essential for crew coordination
      and mission accomplishment during taxi, takeoff, approach, landing, and any flight below
      10,000 feet MSL (except cruise).
      A30.3.13.2. Aircraft Interphone. Primary crewmembers will monitor interphone during
      critical phases of flight. Crewmembers will advise the aircraft commander prior to
      checking off interphone.
      A30.3.13.3. Command Radios.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                     287


          A30.3.13.3.1. The pilot not flying the aircraft normally makes all air traffic control
          (ATC) radio calls. During periods of high tasking it is acceptable for the pilot flying
          the aircraft to assume ATC radio duties.
          A30.3.13.3.2. The pilot operating the radios will announce which radio is primary,
          and will inform the crew when the primary radio changes.
          A30.3.13.3.3. One pilot will record and acknowledge all ATC clearances. Another
          crewmember should monitor the read back and ensure compliance.
          A30.3.13.3.4. Both pilots will monitor UHF guard (or VHF guard when appropriate)
          regardless of primary radio.
   A30.3.14. Functional Check Flights.     For initial takeoff weather minimums during
   FCF/ACF operations, PC-12 aircrews will use the fighter, attack, trainer, and U-2 guidance
   regarding weather found in table 3.1.
A30.4. Instrument Procedures.
   A30.4.1. The U-28/PC-12 is approach category B. The pilot may fly circling approaches at
   higher speeds raising the circling minimums to the category for the speed to be flown. The
   PF is responsible for briefing speeds and flying the approach according to the correct
   minimums.
   A30.4.2. During night or marginal weather, fly a precision approach, if available. If a PAR
   or ILS is not available, fly any available approved instrument approach. On training and
   evaluation flights, or flights at familiar airfields, pilots may fly non-precision approaches or
   VFR patterns to accomplish required training or evaluation requirements.
A30.5. Operating Procedures and Restrictions.
   A30.5.1. Maximum Gross Weights. Operating weights will be in accordance with the flight
   manual (and supplements) weight, altitude, and temperature limits.
   A30.5.2. Flight Duty Period. Observe restrictions and guidance of AFI 11-202 Vol 3,
   Chapter 9 and AFMC Sup 1 for transport type aircraft. In addition to the restrictions for FDP
   in AFI 11-202 Vol. 3, limit crew duty day to 12 hours with an inoperative autopilot even if a
   second qualified U-28/PC-12 pilot is available. If the autopilot fails after departure, continue
   to the next scheduled stop and then comply with the 12-hour duty day limitation.
   A30.5.3. Survival/Aircrew Flight Equipment Requirements.
      A30.5.3.1. On missions carrying passengers, ensure oxygen masks are available for all
      occupants regardless of planned flight altitude.
      A30.5.3.2. A minimum One first aid kit should be onboard the aircraft at all times.
   A30.5.4. Air Work
      A30.5.4.1. Descent. Prior to descent into unfamiliar areas, appropriate terrain charts
      (Operational Navigation Chart (ONC), Sectional Aeronautical Chart, Tactical Pilotage
      Chart (TPC), or Joint Operations Graphic (JOG)) should be reviewed to increase aircrew
      situational awareness of obstructions. Primary crewmembers will not be involved in
      duties other than aircraft operations, descent and approach monitoring, and required
      checklist items from the initial descent point to landing.

      A30.5.4.2. Unusual attitudes, stalls, steep turns, and flight at minimum control airspeed
      will be accomplished clear of clouds and at or above 5,000 feet AGL.
      A30.5.4.3. Steep turns will be limited to 60 degrees of bank during level flight in day,
      VMC; otherwise, bank is limited to 45 degrees. Review stall speeds before
      accomplishing.
      A30.5.4.4. Traffic Pattern Stall Series requires day VMC at a minimum of 5000 feet
      AGL or 5000 feet above cloud deck.
  A30.5.5. Practice/Simulated Emergencies.
      A30.5.5.1. Practice/simulated emergencies will not be accomplished with passengers
      onboard. Emergency procedures, which require placing switches in other than their
      normal positions or placing the aircraft in an abnormal configuration, may only be
      accomplished during training, evaluation, or currency flights when an instructor or flight
      examiner is in one of the pilot seats. Instructor pilot candidates who occupy a pilot seat
      and are under the supervision of a flight examiner pilot (not in a pilot seat) may practice
      simulated emergency procedures during initial or re-qualification upgrade evaluations.
      Preface all simulated emergencies with the word ―simulated‖ and terminate simulated
      emergencies when an actual emergency arises.
      A30.5.5.2. Simulated engine-out. Simulated engine-out maneuvers will only be
      accomplished near a suitable landing area.
      A30.5.5.3. Simulated Forced Landings. Simulated forced landings outside the airfield
      environment due to simulated engine malfunction/failure and other emergencies will only
      be accomplished in VMC under VFR. The IP will initiate the simulated emergency to
      practice a forced landing only in an area previously studied by the IP for hazards and
      obstacles. The IP will terminate the simulated forced landing and direct a go-around no
      lower than 100 feet AGL.
      A30.5.5.4. Practice engine shut-downs will not be accomplished.
  A30.5.6. Aircraft Equipment
      A30.5.6.1. A fully mission capable aircraft is the ultimate objective of the maintenance
      effort. The final responsibility regarding equipment required for a mission rests with the
      aircraft commander. If one aircraft commander accepts an aircraft to operate a mission or
      mission segment without an item or system, this acceptance does not commit that aircraft
      commander, or a different aircraft commander, to subsequent operations with the same
      item or system inoperative. When the aircraft commander considers an item essential,
      designate the component mission essential (ME) on the AFTO Form 781 (or user
      equivalent), and the item will be repaired or replaced prior to departure.
      A30.5.6.2. Engine performance, aircraft attitude, vertical velocity indications, altitude,
      airspeed, and heading instruments should be operative in both pilot positions. For
      instruments with both analog and digital displays, as a minimum the analog portion must
      be operational.

                     C-20 GULFSTREAM OPERATING PROCEDURES

A31.1. General Information. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives,
outlines procedures for operation of the C-20 aircraft under most circumstances. It applies to
AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of C-20 aircraft.
Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe,
effective mission accomplishment.
A31.2. Mission Planning.

Table A31.1. Minimum Crew Complement.

A31.3. Common Mission Guidance.
   A31.3.1. The aircraft commander will determine that all airfield facilities are of suitable
   construction, and weight bearing capacity. If takeoff/departure end overruns are available,
   (stressed or authorized for normal operations), they may be used to increase the runway
   available for takeoff/landing if needed.
       A31.3.1.1. Taxi restrictions: If in doubt, the AC should consider deplaning a
       crewmember to safely marshal the aircraft.
       A31.3.1.2. For 90 degree turns to/from a surface less than 35 feet, but no less than 25
       feet, the other surface will be a minimum width of 45 feet. Offset to the larger surface to
       keep on the pavement.
       A31.3.1.3. Minimum taxiway width for 90 degree turns (with fillets) is from a 35 foot to
       35 foot taxiway. Aircraft Commander will make the final ―on scene‖ decision to use
       approved taxiways.
   A31.3.2. Barriers. Do not takeoff, land or accomplish touch and goes over raised webbing-
   type barriers (e.g., MA-1A, 61QSII). Pilots may takeoff, land or accomplish touch and go
   landings beyond or between raised cables or barriers provided the available distance meets
   minimum runway length requirements.
   A31.3.3. Wind Restrictions. Airfields will be considered below minimums for takeoff and
   landing when winds (including gusts) are greater than: Maximum wind (any direction) - 50
   knots; Maximum tailwind component - 10 knots; Maximum crosswind components,
   corrected for RCR, as specified in TO 1C-20B-1-1. The maximum crosswind component
   during manual (autopilot off) CAT II ILS approaches is 10 knots. The maximum crosswind
   component for practice CAT II ILS approaches is 15 knots.
   A31.3.4. Training Restrictions.
290                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


      A31.3.4.1. Unless specifically authorized elsewhere in this section or in an approved test
      plan, do not practice emergency procedures that degrade aircraft performance or flight
      control capabilities (in-flight).
         A31.3.4.1.1. In-flight, prior to simulating emergency procedures (EP), the pilot will
         notify all crewmembers. In the event of an actual emergency, all student training and
         simulated EPs will be terminated. Training will resume only when the pilot in
         command has determined that no hazard to safe aircraft operations exist.
      A31.3.4.2. Touch-and-Go Landing Limitations.
         A31.3.4.2.1. Touch and Go landings may be performed under direct instructor pilot
         supervision or by a certified mission pilot IAW this instruction, AFI 11-2FTV1, and
         the applicable flight manual. Refer to AFI 11-2FT Vol 1 as supplemented for specific
         touch and go training requirements, restrictions and approved airfields (without IP).
         A31.3.4.2.2. Touch-and-go landings require at least 8000‘ of runway, ensure aircraft
         performance assures full stop capability per aircraft performance manual.
         A31.3.4.2.3. Do not accomplish touch-and-go landings on slush covered runways.
         A31.3.4.2.4. Brief touch-and-go landing considerations with the other appropriate
         aircrew members prior to final approach. On successive approaches, if the briefing
         remains the same and there are no questions, the briefing need not be repeated.
  A31.3.5. Flight Maneuvers. The following maneuvers are authorized for qualification and
  continuation training, except when prohibited or restricted by the flight manual,
  partial/modification flight manual or other applicable directives. Direct instructor pilot (IP)
  super-vision requires the IP to have immediate access to the controls. Comply with Training
  Restrictions of this instruction and the following:
      A31.3.5.1. Simulated Engine Failure. Perform practice or simulated loss of engines
      IAW this instruction and the applicable flight manual.
         A31.3.5.1.1. Approach and Landing, Simulated Engine-Out (direct IP supervision).
         A31.3.5.1.2. Approach and Go-Around, Simulated Engine-Out (direct IP
         supervision). A planned single-engine go-around may be started at any time before
         200 AGL. For an unplanned go-around, use both engines as soon as safe and
         practical.
         A31.3.5.1.3. Simulated Engine Failure Takeoff Continued (Simulated Engine Out
         Climb Out) (direct IP supervision). Minimum altitude to initiate a simulated engine
         failure on takeoff is 200 feet AGL.
      A31.3.5.2. Landing Attitude Demonstration (direct IP supervision).
  A31.3.6. Prohibited maneuvers. The following maneuvers, in addition to those already
  specified in applicable flight manuals, are prohibited unless part of an approved test plan,
  USAF TPS curriculum, ACF/FCF profile, or an actual emergency exists.
      A31.3.6.1. Simulated emergency descents
      A31.3.6.2. Split flap landings

       A31.3.6.3. Tactics maneuvers (except MAJCOM approved tactics maneuvers)
       A31.3.6.4. Aborted takeoffs
       A31.3.6.5. Full stalls
   A31.3.7. Special flight planning considerations:
       A31.3.7.1. Departure Planning:
             A31.3.7.1.1. Refer to AFMAN 11-217 V1 Chapter 9 and AFI 11-202 Vol 3 AFMC
             Sup 1, paragraph 8.7 for authorized departure procedures. VFR departures and
             Jeppesen Special Departure Procedures (SDP‘s) require OG approval. In no case will
             the aircrew perform a VFR departure in lieu of OEI obstacle clearance planning or an
             IFR departure procedure. Use of SDP‘s as alternate departure routing (no
             emergency) is not authorized. Refer to AFMAN 11-217 V1 for description of SDP‘s.
             A31.3.7.1.2. Climb Gradient: IAW AFMAN 11-217 V1 paragraph 9.3, AFMC
             authorizes the use of zero feet obstacle clearance to compute engine-out performance
             data. Refer to AFMAN 11-217 V1. However, if the airport has a Special Departure
             Procedure (SDP) for your type aircraft, you are required to use the SDP for engine-
             out performance planning.
   A31.3.8. Takeoff Minimums and Departure Alternates.

Table A31.2. Takeoff Weather Minimums.

   A31.3.9. Takeoff minimums. IAW AFI 11-202 V3, Table A31.2 describes MAJCOM
   authorized weather minimums for the C-20.
   A31.3.10. Destination Filing Requirements. The forecast destination weather will be
   according to AFI 11-202, Volume 3 and the following:
   A31.3.11. Dual Alternates. IAW AFI 11-202 V3, file two alternates when the forecasted
   weather at the intended destination is below minimums for the lowest suitable approach or
   the forecast surface winds (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected for RCR.
292                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


  A31.3.12. OCONUS. File an alternate, regardless of forecast weather, when the destination
  aerodrome is outside the 48 conterminous states.
  A31.3.13. Remote or Island Destination. When filing to a remote or island destination,
  aircrews will use 1+15 holding fuel (in lieu of an alternate and 45 minutes holding fuel). A
  remote or island destination is defined as any aerodrome which, due to its unique geographic
  location, offers no suitable alternate (civil or military) within 2 hours flying time. The
  forecast weather at the remote or island destination must meet the following criteria:
      A31.3.13.1. The prevailing surface winds, corrected for RCR, must be within limits at
      ETA and forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter, and
      A31.3.13.2. The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than
      published minimums for an available non-precision approach (excluding ASR), for ETA
      plus 2 hours. NOTE: If a precision approach is available, the ceiling or visibility may be
      temporarily (TEMPO) below non-precision approach minimums (excluding ASR), but
      not below precision approach minimums (for ETA plus 2 hours).
      A31.3.13.3. When filing to a destination where the alternate is located in Alaska or at
      latitudes greater than 59 degrees, aircrews will use 1+15 holding fuel in lieu of 45
      minutes holding fuel. This extra holding fuel is not a substitute for normal alternate fuel
      planning, but rather an additional safety margin.
  A31.3.13.4. Compute holding fuel using planned destination or alternate gross weight as
  applicable to destination filing requirements.
  A31.3.14. Adverse Weather.
      A31.3.14.1. Icing. The Air Force Weather Agency Technical Note (AFWA/TN 98/002)
      Meteorological Techniques, states that freezing drizzle is equivalent to moderate icing
      and freezing rain is equivalent to severe icing. Flight into areas of forecast or reported
      severe icing (freezing rain) is prohibited.
         A31.3.14.1.1. Prior to using anti-icing fluids, ensure wings and flight control surfaces
         are clear of frost, ice and snow (de-iced via hot air or heated type I fluids IAW
         operations manuals). As a guide, ACs may use published anti-icing holdover times
         IAW AF T.O. 42C-1-2 Aircraft Anti-icing Procedures, and AFFSA holdover tables
         located at the FAA website: http://www.faa.gov/avr/afs/fsat/fsat0301.doc. The
         holdover time begins when anti-icing fluid is first applied and the AC shall use time,
         temperature, and dilution of mixture to determine when times are exceeded and re-
         apply fluid, if required. NOTE: In all cases, ACs shall ensure visual inspection
         within 5 minutes of takeoff.
         A31.3.14.1.2. SAE Type I/II anti-icing fluids are suitable for use on C-20 aircraft.
         Air Force Military Specification Type 1 and Type 2 anti-icing fluid is similar to SAE
         Type I/II fluid, but has different properties. Typical use of Mil Spec Type 1 fluids is
         to heat the fluid and de-ice the aircraft, as the concentration of glycol/water is
         inconsistent. NOTE: With any Mil Spec Type 1/2 fluid, there is no guarantee to
         prevent re-freezing. As a result, there is no holdover time associated with this fluid.
         A31.3.14.1.3. SAE Type II/IV anti-icing fluid differs from SAE Type I fluid in that it
         has a higher viscosity and adheres longer to aircraft surfaces. SAE Type II/IV fluid,
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                 293


          when applied, has a molasses-like appearance, and is subsequently blown off aircraft
          surfaces during takeoff acceleration, (approximately 80 knots).
          A31.3.14.1.4. Based on actual testing and review of the runoff characteristics in the
          undiluted (neat) form, Gulfstream has determined that Type IV de-icing fluid is
          aerodynamically acceptable for the wing. Listed Type IV de-icing fluids that are
          approved for use on the Gulfstream aircraft may be used in all dilution mixtures.
              Approved Type IV                    Unapproved Fluids
              Union Carbide Ultra +               Arktica

              Octagon Max Flight
              Kilfrost ABC-S
   A31.3.15. Turbulence. Flights into areas of forecast or reported severe turbulence are
   prohibited. Knowledge of the tropopause flight level will help in altitude planning to avoid
   turbulent flight areas. Ask the weather briefer for the tropopause flight level whenever
   possible. Turbulence can be expected +4000 feet of this altitude. Do not fly into an area of
   known or forecast moderate or greater mountain wave turbulence
   A31.3.16. Fuel Limitations. C-20 aircraft are not allowed to operate on JP-8+100 except in
   emergency conditions. If inadvertent refueling with JP-8+100 occurs, the aircraft will be
   immediately de-fueled prior to flight. All JP-8+100 locations are required to maintain a
   clean JP-8 capability to support transient aircraft. Every effort must be made not to allow
   aircraft flight while serviced with JP-8+100. If emergency refueling occurs utilizing JP-
   8+100, flight crews will make an AFTO 781 entry stating, ―CAUTION: Aircraft refueled
   using JP-8+100, preventive measures must be taken when de-fueling. Close coordination
   with maintenance and POL fuels personnel must be accomplished.‖
   A31.3.17. Local TOLD Card. The aircraft commander will complete the entire TOLD card,
   including the landing portion, prior to departure. Pilot not flying (PNF) will confirm
   accuracy of FMS computed performance data and complete manual TOLD card when
   directed by the aircraft commander.
   A31.3.18. Multiple Full-Stop Landings. For all practice, full-stop landings, the PNF will
   complete a new TOLD card using actual GW, field, and weather conditions. PNF will
   confirm accuracy of FMS computed performance data and complete manual TOLD card
   when directed by the aircraft commander.
A31.4. Instrument Procedures.
   A31.4.1. The C-20 is primarily approach category C.
   A31.4.2. RNAV, GPS and RNAV(GPS) Instrument Departures, Arrival and Approaches.
   All C-20 aircrews are authorized to fly pure GPS, RNAV, and RNAV(GPS) instrument
   departures, arrivals, day or night, IMC or VMC. Comply with procedures IAW AFI 11-
   202V3 and temperature corrections procedures IAW AFI 11-202V3 and FIH. Aircraft must
   have required navigation performance (RNP) set IAW MD procedures as published on the
   IAP. PNF shall monitor lateral cross track, vertical velocity trends, IAW operations manual
   guidance and report alerts (RNP, RAIM or loss of GPS signal) to the Pilot Flying (PF). PF
   shall execute missed approach if excessive deviations occur.
294                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


      A31.4.2.1. Equipment. Aircraft must have operable RNAV (INS/IRS) and/or GPS-
      updated FMC equipment to ensure sufficient RAIM, or appropriate level of ANP is
      available IAW operations manual procedures prior to initiating the approach. IAP notes
      such as ―DME/DME RNP 0.3 N/A‖ or ―GPS Required‖ state that GPS signal and aircraft
      equipment must be operational to start the approach. If the required approach
      RAIM/ANP is not available, the approach shall not be flown.
      A31.4.2.2. RNAV Instrument Approaches. Properly trained C-20 aircrews and certified
      aircraft are approved to perform LNAV approaches IAW AFI 11-202V3 and operations
      manual guidance applies.
      A31.4.2.3. LNAV approaches. LNAV approaches are non-precision approaches and
      may be flown IMC to a barometric LNAV MDA(H). They may be also be flown using
      VNAV procedures to a derived decision altitude (DDA) = LNAV MDA(H) +50ft. PNF
      shall monitor lateral track error IAW operations manual guidance and provide trends to
      the PF.
      A31.4.2.4. Flying Conventional Approaches Without GPS in the Title. Approaches in
      the FMS database without ―GPS‖ or ―or GPS‖ in the title may only be used to enhance
      position orientation. When flying a conventional approach, pilots may use RNAV
      equipment for situational awareness, but may not use RNAV as the sole means of course
      guidance inside the FAF. The NAVAID(s) in the approach title is(are) the primary
      NAVAID(s) and must be serviceable, tuned, identified, monitored and displayed to the
      pilot throughout the approach.
      A31.4.2.5. Minimum descent altitudes.         For all overlay approaches, FMC/FMS
      procedures are approved no lower than the published MDA and WX minima as
      prescribed on the underlying approach. Barometric LNAV procedures IAW operations
      manual guidance are authorized no lower than computed derived decision altitude
      (DDA). Overlay DDA is defined as MDA plus 50 feet. This enables aircraft tail
      clearance over required obstacle clearance at MDA.
      A31.4.2.6. Crew actions: Prior to initiating the overlay approach, crews shall determine
      WGS-84 status, applicable GPS inhibit procedures, and MEL restrictions that would
      affect equipment and approach capability. This includes NAVAIDs which must be
      monitored (if applicable) and actions to be taken if FMS reliability exceeds tolerances. If
      the underlying NAVAID exceed tolerances, or ANP exceeds RNP (RAIM/RNP alerts),
      the crew will disregard FMS guidance and transition to the underlying approach (if
      applicable) or take over visually.
         A31.4.2.6.1. WGS-84 Status:
             A31.4.2.6.1.1. If WGS-84 compliance is in question, contact AFMC/TERPS or

             A31.4.2.6.1.2. WGS-84 compliance. Individual country compliance with the
             World Geodesic System (1984) means that the country‘s NAVAID and obstacle
             database conforms to the same US grid standard that today‘s updated avionics use
             to determine position. US NAS/Canadian domestic airspace can be assumed to be
             WGS-84 compliant. WGS-84 standard is used to determine accredited countries
             to authorize RNAV(GPS) and overlay terminal procedures. ACs shall contact
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                 295


              MAJCOM TERPS to determine country status if in doubt as to a country‘s WGS-
              84 status. RNAV/GPS and Overlay approaches may not be flown in non-
              compliant or undetermined WGS-84 countries unless:
              A31.4.2.6.1.3. WGS-84 Non-compliant. GPS must not be used as part of the
              FMC/FMS navigation solution for any portion of the IAP. Additionally, the GPS
              signal shall be inhibited IAW operations manual procedures and the aircraft must
              be able to maintain required RNP for operations without GPS. The operations
              flight manual shall provide specific procedures for flying IAPs in non-compliant
              WGS-84 countries.
              A31.4.2.6.1.4. WGS-84 Undetermined. The underlying NAVAID must be tuned,
              identified, monitored and displayed in the cockpit. LNAV and/or VNAV
              operations manual procedures may be used to MDA or DDA only. The approach
              briefing shall include PF and PM duties to monitor ground based NAVAID IAW
              operations manual procedures, as this it the primary navigation.
A31.5. Operating Procedures and Restrictions.
   A31.5.1. Maintenance specialists and civil contractors, flying for the purpose of conducting
   in-flight maintenance inspections are considered MESPs. These specialists should be
   deplaned after completion of the in-flight inspection. Authorize MESPs and MEGPs via
   DCMA form 644 or equivalent .

                                          Attachment 33
                          FALCON 20 OPERATING PROCEDURES

A33.1. General Information. This attachment, in conjunction with other governing directives,
outlines procedures for operation of the Falcon 20 aircraft under most circumstances. It applies
to AFMC aircrews and all management levels concerned with operation of all Falcon 20 series
aircraft. Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished if they
enhance safe, effective mission accomplishment.
A33.2. Mission Planning. A flight shall not be commenced until all pertinent flight data has
been compiled, including the pilot‘s flight log as specified in chapter 12 and an ATC flight plan
or Flight Itinerary has been filed. Likewise the PIC shall not commence a flight unless it has
been ascertained that the facilities available and directly required for such flight and for the safe
operation of the aircraft are adequate, including communication facilities and navigation aids.
For transoceanic flights, the aircrew will retain the trip documentation (flight log, plotting chart,
weather, etc.) and give to the chief pilot upon completion of the trip. The chief pilot will retain
the documents for six months.
   A33.2.1. Weather Considerations. The following Weather considerations will be reviewed
   as part of the flight planning process.
       A33.2.1.1. SEVERE WEATHER. No aircraft will be dispatched into an area of known
       thunderstorms unless the aircraft is equipped with operating weather radar. Flights shall
       not proceed through areas in which turbulence of more than moderate intensity exists
       unless the flight crew cannot avoid those areas by weather radar references. Passengers
       will be advised to fasten seat belts prior to anticipated severe weather and seat belt signs
       illuminated.
       A33.2.1.2. WIND SHEAR. Wind shear may create a severe hazard for aircraft below
       1,000 ft AGL in the vicinity of a "micro burst", particularly during the approach to
       landing and in the take-off phases. Because of the hazards associated with flying through
       and in the vicinity of these intense downdrafts, which on reaching the surface spread
       outward from the down flow centre in all directions, the best defense is to avoid it
       altogether as it could be beyond you or your aircraft's capability. Pilots are to heed wind
       shear PIREPs as a previous pilot's encounter may be the only warning you will receive.
       On receiving such notice, alternate action such as delaying a departure or an arrival until
       the phenomena has passed is recommended. If wind shear is encountered, prompt action
       is required. In all aircraft, the recovery could require full power and pitch attitude
       consistent with the maximum angle of attack for the aircraft. In addition, warn others as
       soon as possible by sending a PIREP to the closest air traffic services facility.
       A33.2.1.3. ICING.        The flight crew shall give careful consideration to all factors
       involved when operating into areas of known or anticipated areas of icing and assure that
       the aircraft anti-icing and de-icing systems are functioning properly. The only time a
       structurally or externally modified XYZ CONTRACTORFF aircraft will be flown in
       icing is for transitional purposes. Continued flight into areas of icing greater than light
       rime shall be avoided. For the phase of flight during a XYZ CONTRACTORFF Flight
       Test operating into conditions of known or predicted icing is prohibited. If icing
 298                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


       conditions are encountered which have not been reported or forecast, it should be
       reported to the nearest Flight Service Station or Air Traffic Control unit.
   A33.2.2. Flight Plans. Flight test and demonstration flights will be flown under IFR to the
   maximum extent consistent with mission accomplishment. When IFR is not practical, a VFR
   flight plan will be filed or equivalent data will be left with a responsible agency or individual.
   On flights conducted under VFR, radar traffic advisories and TCAS will be utilized to the
   maximum extent possible. Appropriate and current VFR charts must be available and used
   prior to commencing VFR operations.
   A33.2.3. Aircraft Weight and Balance. The pilot-in-command is responsible for the proper
   loading, including load security, weight and weight distribution. All loadings (including
   fuel) shall be distributed using the current weight and balance report. The load shall be
   distributed to ensure that the center of gravity will remain within the prescribed limits
   throughout the entire flight.
       A33.2.3.1. Aircraft take-off and landing weights shall not exceed that which would
       preclude the aircraft meeting performance requirements for take-off, en-route and landing
       at any aerodrome used.
       A33.2.3.2. The weight & balance calculation may take two forms: one that is pre-
       computed for different fuel and passenger loads, and the other that is individually
       prepared for a specific flight reflecting non-standard loading. If the specific flight has
       non-standard loading, the UltraNav program should be utilized to compute the weight &
       balance calculation.
       A33.2.3.3. The pilot-in-command will ensure that all items carried that are not included
       in the equipment list that forms part of the weight and balance report have been included
       in the weight calculations.
       A33.2.3.4. Each aircraft shall have a current weight and balance report with an up-to-
       date equipment list. Using this information, the center of gravity location and operational
       empty weight (OEW) shall be calculated.
   A33.2.4. Aircraft with a MEL. Flight crews shall comply with MEL procedures approved
   for the specific aircraft. MEL deferral procedures are specified in each MEL approved for
   the aircraft. Flight crews shall ensure that all ―Operations‖ and ―Maintenance‖ procedures
   are followed.
   A33.2.5. Turbulence. Flights shall not be planned or flown through area of moderate
   turbulence. When approaching areas of anticipated turbulence, NCM should be verbally
   advised and if possible, the FASTEN SEAT BELT sign illuminated.
A33.3. Common Mission Guidance.
   A33.3.1. Crew Complement. Minimum crew for the FA 20 MODEL C is 2 pilots. Crew
   complement for the FA 20 MODEL G, see Table A33.1.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                       299

   A33.3.2. Oxygen Requirement. Except for maintenance test flights, ferry flights and flight
   test programs, Flight Facility aircraft will not be flown unpressurized above 10,000 feet
   MSL. Flight test aircraft will adhere to the requirements set forth in service guidance
   regarding the use of oxygen.
   A33.3.3. Passenger Briefing. The PIC will ensure that prior to flying in the aircraft; every
   passenger will have received a briefing with the following information: the fastening,
   unfastening, tightening and general use of safety belts or safety harnesses; the use and
   location of the passenger oxygen system including the location and use of oxygen masks; the
   location and use of the portable oxygen bottle; the location of emergency exits and for NCM
   seated next to an exit, how that exit operates; the location, purpose of, and advisability of
   reading the passenger safety briefing card; the location of any emergency equipment the
   passenger may have a need for in an emergency situation such as the ELT, fire extinguisher,
   survival equipment (including the means to access if in a locked compartment), first aid kit,
   life preserver or flotation device and life raft; flight Facility procedures regarding the use of
   portable electronic devices, and any other considerations based on the configuration of the
   aircraft cabin and equipment; the advisability of using safety belts or safety harnesses during
   flight; the safest direction and most hazard-free route for passenger movement away from the
   airplane following deplaning and any dangers associated with the airplane type such as pitot
   tube locations, propellers, or engine intakes; location and operation of engineering power kill
   switch.
      A33.3.3.1. The pilot-in-command shall ensure that NCM are given a safety briefing as
      appropriate to the passenger's needs; and covers at least the items specified in this
      section. The standard safety briefing may be shortened for regular/recurring NCM who
      are familiar with the aircraft, route and have repeated exposure to that type of flight.
      A33.3.3.2. Smoking is not permitted on any Flight Facility-operated aircraft by NCM or
      crewmembers. NCM will be advised of this policy
   A33.3.4. Flight Data Recorder. Where installed, the FDR shall be operated continuously
   from the time the electrical power is first applied to the time that the aircraft is shut down and
   the electrical power is removed.
   A33.3.5. TCAS. Where installed, TCAS will be checked in accordance with the
   manufacturer's instructions before the first flight of the day.
   A33.3.6. Fueling. Pilots or Crew Chiefs will supervise the fuelling of their aircraft to ensure
   that it is properly bonded and the aircraft is fueled as desired.
   A33.3.7. Cargo. Cargo may not be carried outside a cargo compartment unless: it is carried
   in an approved cargo rack, bin, or compartment installed in the airplane, or it is properly
   secured by a safety belt or other tie down having enough strength to eliminate the possibility
300                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


  of shifting under all normally anticipated flight and ground conditions, or it is packaged or
  covered to avoid possible injury to passengers, or it is not located in a position that restricts
  the access to or use of any required emergency or regular exit or the use of the aisle between
  the crew and the passenger compartment.
      A33.3.7.1. When cargo is carried in cargo compartments accessible in-flight, the cargo
      must be loaded so as to allow a crew member to effectively reach all parts of the
      compartment with the contents of a hand fire extinguisher.
      A33.3.7.2. At the discretion of any pilot or maintenance technician, any piece of cargo
      may be opened for inspection prior to being accepted for flight aboard any Flight Facility
      aircraft.
  A33.3.8. Runway Surface Condition. Use only hard-surfaced runways for takeoff or
  landing. The runway condition will be such that structural damage or undue concern of crew
  or passengers will not occur
  A33.3.9. Takeoff Restrictions. No takeoff shall be initiated when the following conditions
  exist: Freezing rain, hail, or severe icing conditions; heavy wet falling snow or ice adhering
  to any part of the aircraft; thunderstorms at, or adjacent to, the airport; inoperative radar or
  other approved thunderstorm detection equipment when thunderstorms or other potentially
  hazardous weather conditions are present or forecast anywhere along the intended route;
  hazardous weather or conditions at the destination or alternate(s) which will prevent a safe
  landing; braking actions reported nil; dry snow greater than four inches (4") in depth
  covering an appreciable part of the runway. (Aircraft Flight Manual will be adhered to if it is
  more restrictive); standing water of greater than three-quarters of an inch (¾") in depth
  covering an appreciable part of the runway. (Aircraft Flight Manual will be adhered to if it is
  more restrictive.)
      A33.3.9.1. If a takeoff must be made with standing water, slush or snow covering the
      runway, takeoff performance shall be based the published contaminated runway take-off
      distance.
  A33.3.10. Deicing. Prior to flight, the aircraft shall be deiced by appropriate procedures and
  no takeoff shall be attempted with frost, snow, or ice accumulations on wing and tail
  surfaces, windshield, pitot static, or angle of attack system. Flight /Maintenance Manual
  Supplements contain detailed procedures for ground deicing of their respective aircraft.
  When practical, the aircraft should be placed in a hangar during periods of inclement
  weather.
  A33.3.10.1. Avoid spraying wheel and brake assemblies with de-icing fluid. Ice and
  moisture buildup in the brake stack may cause the brakes to freeze and lock after departure or
  following taxi and shutdown. When moisture and freezing weather conditions exist, using
  firm brake pressure during taxi can minimize problems. This will permit the brake stack to
  reach a warm condition, minimizing any moisture buildup within the stack. Snow/slush may
  also be removed by cycling the landing gear after takeoff. Firm touchdowns should be made
  when landing with suspected frozen brakes. The parking brake should be released as soon as
  possible following shutdown in conditions conducive to freezing.
  A33.3.11. Sterile Cockpit. When operating within 10 nm of the airport of intended
  departure or landing (jet aircraft, 5 nm for propeller aircraft) and with the intent of takeoff or
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                     301


   landing, Flight Crew Members will not engage in non-pertinent conversation between
   themselves or with NCM.
   A33.3.12. Descent. Once cleared below FL180 domestically or at appropriate transition
   level internationally, the current barometric setting as received from the controlling authority
   will be repeated aloud as a means of acknowledgment in the cockpit. Altimeters will then be
   set and cross-checked.
      A33.3.12.1. The PF will make the following altitude callouts during the descent phase of
      every flight: "Flight Level 180/transition level, altimeters set and cross-checked".
      A33.3.12.2. Both pilots will monitor the altimeters during descent to negate the
      possibility of one pilot reading the instruments incorrectly.
      A33.3.12.3. If turbulence is anticipated at a lower level, airspeed will be reduced to
      appropriate turbulence penetration speed.
      A33.3.12.4. The approach briefing will be conducted during the final enroute descent
      and will be completed well before reaching the Final Approach Fix (FAF). The briefing
      will cover all pertinent details relating to the instrument approach, runway exit, missed
      approach, terrain awareness and crew coordination.
      A33.3.12.5. The altitude preselect (when available) will be set as follows:
          A33.3.12.5.1. Precision Approach: Missed Approach Altitude
          A33.3.12.5.2. Non Precision Approach (using MDA): Minimum Descent Altitude
          (MDA)
          A33.3.12.5.3. Non Precision Approach (VGP/LPV)            : Missed Approach Altitude
          A33.3.12.5.4. Visual Approach: 500‘ AGL or pilot‘s discretion
   A33.3.13. Touch-and-Go Landing Limitations.
      A33.3.13.1. Touch and Go landings may be performed under direct instructor pilot
      supervision or by a certified mission pilot IAW this instruction, AFI 11-2FTV1, and the
      applicable flight manual. Refer to AFI 11-2FT Vol 1 as supplemented for specific touch
      and go training requirements, restrictions and approved airfields (without IP).
      A33.3.13.2. Touch-and-go landings require at least 8000‘ of runway, ensure aircraft
      performance assures full stop capability per aircraft performance manual.
      A33.3.13.3. Do not accomplish touch-and-go landings on slush covered runways.
      A33.3.13.4. Brief touch-and-go landing considerations with the other appropriate aircrew
      members prior to final approach. On successive approaches, if the briefing remains the
      same and there are no questions, the briefing need not be repeated.
A33.4. Instrument Procedures.
   A33.4.1. The Falcon 20 is approach category C.
   A33.4.2. On non-precision approaches, all NAVAIDs available should be utilized to back up
   the approach. This includes the FMS lateral and vertical navigation features as necessary.
   The PNF will call out movement of the lateral/vertical steering guidance from the fully
   deflected position on the HSI (i.e., VOR radial or Localizer), "Localizer or Course Alive"
302                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


  and "Glide Slope Alive" if appropriate. When the Flight Director captures the lateral/vertical
  steering, both pilots will acknowledge "Localizer or Course Capture and Glide Slope
  Capture".
  A33.4.3. Final Approach. To the maximum extent possible, all actual IMC approaches will
  be executed coupled to the autopilot, in particular, when conducting approaches to near
  minimum weather conditions. In addition, the aircraft will depart the final approach fix in a
  stabilized condition, i.e. on altitude, on speed, and in the appropriate approach configuration.
  A33.4.4. Inter-cockpit calls. The PF will call for landing gear down and the Before Landing
  Checklist at or prior to the FAF. The landing shall not be made until the checklist is
  complete. If the situation permits, an abnormality encountered during the landing phase will
  be cause for rejecting the landing, followed by a climb to a safe altitude and an investigation
  of the problem in an organized manner.
      A33.4.4.1. After passing the FAF on all approaches, the PNF shall monitor the
      instruments and will call out any warning indications or significant deviations from the
      planned flight path, descent rate, or airspeed.
      A33.4.4.2. The PNF will also make the following calls:
         A33.4.4.2.1. ―Airspeed‖, when airspeed is below Vref or in excess of Vapp + 10
         A33.4.4.2.2. ―Sink Rate‖, when sink rate exceeds 1000 ft/min.
         A33.4.4.2.3. ―Localizer‖ or ―Glideslope‖ if one dot deviation is exceeded.
         A33.4.4.2.4. ―Bank‖, when bank angle is greater than 30 degrees.
         A33.4.4.2.5. At ―1000 ft. above minimums‖
         A33.4.4.2.6. At ―500 ft. above minimums‖
         A33.4.4.2.7. At ―100 ft. above minimums‖
      A33.4.4.3. The PF will acknowledge deviation call outs. (i.e. ―correcting‖)
      A33.4.4.4. The following are mandatory calls:
         A33.4.4.4.1. ―Minimums, Runway/Lights at          (clock position)‖ when the runway
         threshold is completely in view and the aircraft positioned suitable for the pilot to
         take over and continue the approach visually.
         A33.4.4.4.2. PF will acknowledge with ―Contact‖ if the runway threshold is in view
         and sufficient to continue the landing.
         A33.4.4.4.3. ―Minimums, Go Around‖ if no approved visual references are available
         or the aircraft is not in position to continue a normal approach. Concurrence and
         acknowledgement by the PF is required.
         A33.4.4.4.4. ―Go Around,‖ at anytime during the approach until before touchdown if
         the PNF feels safety is in question. The PF will acknowledge the call and initiate an
         immediate, unquestioned missed approach and the issue will be resolved when the
         aircraft is safely established on the missed approach.
      A33.4.4.5. As the minimum altitude or forecast ceiling is approached, the PNF will
      periodically direct his/her attention outside the airplane to establish visual contact with
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                      303


      the approach lights or runway. The PNF must ensure that the PF has the runway or
      approach lights in sight.
   A33.4.5. Visual Approaches. The PF should attain a "stabilized approach", i.e. on altitude,
   on airspeed, and in the appropriate landing configuration prior to passing 500' AGL on a
   visual approach. Available lateral and vertical guidance (e.g. ILS) will be utilized as
   required to assist in runway alignment.
   A33.4.6. Circling Approaches. The visual portion of the approach should be planned so as
   not to exceed 30 degrees angle of bank. The approach must be stabilized (on speed, wings
   level, on a normal glide path) by 300‘ AGL.
   A33.4.7. FMS/GPS Approach Operations. Crews should use all available radio NAVAIDs,
   but also should endeavor to navigate using identical navigation displays. FMS programming
   for the IAP and the approach briefing should be completed prior to arrival into the terminal
   area, preferably prior to descent. The CDU should be examined to confirm that all waypoints
   and course/distances contained in the database procedure, including the missed approach,
   conform to the printed chart. The approach chart is the final authority. Proper setting of the
   Altitude Pre-selector (ASEL) is critical to VNAV approach operations. Incorrect settings of
   the ASEL may result in unintentional level off or descents when VNAV is engaged. Both
   pilots will confirm all settings verbally.
      A33.4.7.1. Display and Monitoring Requirements. Approved GPS Overlay and all
      GPS/FMS Stand alone Procedures: Both pilots display FMS on EFIS/HSI.
      A33.4.7.2. GPS approaches will not be conducted at non-WGS-84 compliant airports.
A33.5. Operating Procedures and Restrictions.
   A33.5.1. Aircraft Parking and Securing. The Pilot-In-Command is responsible for the
   security and safe disposition of the aircraft and its contents (including secure data) during all
   layovers. Parking the aircraft in a secure, well-lighted area, away from boundary fences and
   within direct observation of security personnel shall always be considered.
   A33.5.2. When strong winds or storms are expected, the aircraft should be parked as nearly
   headed into the anticipated wind as possible. Under these circumstances, brakes should be
   reset after the heat generated during the landing and taxiing has dissipated.
   A33.5.3. During overnights or extended layovers (especially in winter weather, or when
   thunderstorms with possible hail are anticipated), the Pilot-In-Command will arrange for
   hangar accommodations where available. Whenever possible, these arrangements should be
   made well in advance of the scheduled arrival.
   A33.5.4. Where hangar facilities are not available, the Pilot-In-Command must ensure that
   adequate facilities are available to de-ice the aircraft during cold weather operations. In
   addition, water should be drained from the aircraft system and other items that could freeze
   and break should be removed.
   A33.5.5. Post flight inspection similar to the preflight walk-around inspection should be
   accomplished.
   A33.5.6. If maintenance is required, the Pilot-In-Command will discuss such arrangements
   with the crew chief or his/her designee. If the possibility of a delay exists, alternate
304                                AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


  arrangements should be discussed with all affected persons (non-flying crewmembers,
  engineering team members, crew chief, etc.).
  A33.5.7. The FBO should be given a contact number where crewmembers can be reached in
  the event of an emergency
  A33.5.8. As soon as possible, the Pilot-In-Command will brief maintenance on all
  discrepancies that exist. Aircraft discrepancy sheets will be filled out for any discrepancies
  that need attention.
  A33.5.9. Recording of Aircraft Defects. An aircraft maintenance log will be carried on each
  flight and discrepancies encountered during the flight clearly and concisely entered in the log
  to assist Maintenance in rectifying the problem. Maintenance personnel will briefly note the
  remedial action opposite the particular discrepancy in the log. Previous write-ups that remain

   A36.3.1. (EDWARDSAFB) The TFC establishes contacts with the host base or agency and
   with the assistance of other team members, develops any Memoranda of
   Understanding/Agreement (MOU/MOA) required to support operations at the host base.
   Resources may not be committed through an MOU/MOA. If resources must be expended,
   separate funding documents (i.e. Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR)) must
   be arranged to provide funds. The Program Introduction Document/Statement of Capability,
   (PID/SOC) process will be used for aircraft test deployments where the host base uses
   PID/SOCs.
   A36.3.2. (EDWARDSAFB) The TFC selects a team to conduct a site survey, if required.
   As a minimum the team should include representatives from maintenance, supply and
   logistics in addition to personnel representing specific test requirements to ensure basic
   deployment support is adequately planned. This survey, conducted a minimum of two
   months in advance of the deployment, should ensure the adequacy of facilities at the
   operating location. Attachment 3 contains a sample site survey checklist.
   A36.3.3. (EDWARDSAFB) The 412th Mission Support Group, Traffic Management
   Branch, will assist in preparing documentation for shipping (i.e., Requisition and
   Invoice/Shipping Document, DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document.
   Each unit will prepare the equipment for shipping (i.e., drain/purge).
   A36.3.4. (EDWARDSAFB) The squadron operations and administration sections prepare a
   "trip kit" containing commonly used operations and administrative forms, pertinent
   regulations and applicable FCIFs. A sample trip kit list is contained in Attachment 35.
A36.4. (EDWARDSAFB) PREDEPARTURE BRIEFING. The deployment of 412 TW
assets is a high visibility mission. The following pre-deployment briefings are required:
   A36.4.1. (EDWARDSAFB) The TFC prepares a deployment package and briefs the 412
   OG/CC. The package includes as a minimum:
       A36.4.1.1. (EDWARDSAFB) TFC and alternate.
       A36.4.1.2. (EDWARDSAFB) Task Force personnel.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                    311


       A36.4.1.3. (EDWARDSAFB) Local points of contact.
       A36.4.1.4. (EDWARDSAFB) MOU/MOA or PID/SOC.
       A36.4.1.5. (EDWARDSAFB) Schedule for test.
   A36.4.2. (EDWARDSAFB) The TFC prepares and conducts a briefing for all members of
   the deployed test force. This briefing will be held a minimum of two days prior to departure
   and should include:
       A36.4.2.1. (EDWARDSAFB) TFC and alternate.
       A36.4.2.2. (EDWARDSAFB) Task Force chain of command.
       A36.4.2.3. (EDWARDSAFB) Mission/test objectives/classification.

       A36.4.2.5. (EDWARDSAFB) Clothing, uniforms, professional gear.
       A36.4.2.6. (EDWARDSAFB) Personal documents.
       A36.4.2.7. (EDWARDSAFB) Leave policy.
       A36.4.2.8. (EDWARDSAFB) Rental car policy.
       A36.4.2.9. (EDWARDSAFB) Emergency notification.
       A36.4.2.10. (EDWARDSAFB) Lodging and messing facilities.
A36.5. (EDWARDSAFB) OFF-SITE SUPPORT. The key to adequate support at deployed
locations is careful and complete pre-departure planning. The following areas require the most
attention:
   A36.5.1. (EDWARDSAFB) The Maintenance Chief is the primary point of contact
   between the TFC and the maintenance team. It is imperative that relations be established with
   maintenance agencies at the operating location. The type and level of contacts will depend on
   such factors as the priority and complexity of the mission, the number of aircraft, the type of
   support required and the time sensitivity of the takeoff. It is important to establish
   maintenance requirements early with the host base. Use the site survey visit to establish
   contacts and review facilities. USAF Maintenance Precedence and the Force Activity
   Designator (FAD) for the test program should be indicated in maintenance and support
   agreements. The maintenance precedence and FAD will affect the priority the host base
   assigns to maintaining the task force aircraft.
   A36.5.2. (EDWARDSAFB) When civilian employees are included in the deployment, care
   is required to properly schedule their work hours. In the performance of duties during
   Temporary Duty (TDY), management may require civilians to adjust their work hours to
   support the deployment schedule. Civilian employees are authorized overtime pay for any
   work in excess of their regular work hours. Pay will be calculated IAW applicable laws, rules
   and regulations. Supervisors of bargaining unit employees assigned to deployments should
   ensure reasonable rest periods are provided to all personnel when possible.
   A36.5.3. (EDWARDSAFB) Contractor employees must use their company‘s respective
   travel procedures. However, occasionally it may be necessary to use government billeting or
   other government services due to geographic isolation of the proposed test site, work
 312                               AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012


   schedules or situations where separation from the rest of the team is not acceptable. If these
   conditions exist, it will be necessary to arrange government sponsored orders. Government
   TDY Orders DO NOT replace normal company travel requirements or policies. They simply
   authorize the use of specified government goods or services. Because contractor travel
   requirements and use of Government goods and services are stipulated by their contract, you
   should begin this process by contacting the appropriate Contract Administrator within the
   AFFTC‘s Directorate of Contracting.
   A36.5.4. (EDWARDSAFB) Maximum use of government facilities should be planned for
   the deployment. The site survey team should review government facilities for adequacy. In
   the event facilities are not available or the use of these facilities would impair the
   performance of duties essential to the mission, the site survey team will locate local lodging
   for the deployment. The decision to use other than government facilities should be
   documented and approved by the Squadron Commander.
   A36.5.5. (EDWARDSAFB) Arrangements will be made for military, General Services
   Administration or commercial rental cars at the operating location, if required. The TFC will
   attempt to prearrange the use of military U-drive vehicles at each military operating location.
   The standard request will include one vehicle per four individuals. This criterion may vary
   based on size of available vehicles and specific crew needs.
       A36.5.5.1. (EDWARDSAFB) A Policy and Procedure Letter for rental cars is included
       in the trip kit.
       A36.5.5.2. (EDWARDSAFB) The TFC will coordinate with the Maintenance Chief to
       ensure adequate arrangements are made for transporting maintenance personnel between
       the aircraft and quarters when required.
   A36.5.6. (EDWARDSAFB) The TFC is responsible to ensure the security of test assets and
   test data.
       A36.5.6.1. (EDWARDSAFB) The TFC should review AFI 10-701, Operations Security
       (OPSEC) and the AFMC Supplement. The TFC should evaluate the Security Annex of
       the project DTP for specific procedures for OPSEC and Communications Security
       (COMSEC).
       A36.5.6.2. (EDWARDSAFB) The TFC should designate couriers for classified
       materials which must be transported to and from the operating location. Details for
       appointing couriers are outlined in AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
       Management. As a minimum, the courier needs a Letter of Designation which includes a
       military identification card number and briefed IAW DD Form 2501, Courier
       Authorization (Accountable).
A36.6. (EDWARDSAFB) DEPLOYED TEST MANAGEMENT. Test cards must agree
with approved test plans and AFFTC Form 5028. The SQ/CC will sign low risk test cards. High
and medium risk cards will be approved by 412 TW/CC and 412 OG/CC respectively.
   A36.6.1. (EDWARDSAFB) If the test requires airspace or assets at the operating location,
   the TFC will ensure requirements are scheduled correctly.
AFI11-2FTV3_EDWARDSAFBSUP_I 22 AUGUST 2012                                                   313


   A36.6.2. (EDWARDSAFB) The TFC conducts postflight debriefings with flight crews and
   engineering to review results and contacts squadron supervision of significant test results.
   The TFC will make a daily report to the SQ/CC or DO.
   A36.6.3. (EDWARDSAFB) The PE assures status reports to the test Squadron Commander
   and Project Manager are dispatched as directed.
A36.7. (EDWARDSAFB) FLIGHT OPERATIONS. The following command and control
procedures are a minimum for flight operations. They can be expanded or modified by an
approved test plan or SRB.
   A36.7.1. (EDWARDSAFB) AF 4327a, Crew Flight Authorization, or AF IMT 4327,
   ARMS Flight Authorization, should be prepared for each deployed sortie and signed by the
   TFC. In the absence of a TFC, the Aircraft Commander will clear the flight through the
   applicable AFFTC Squadron Operations Section.
   A36.7.2. (EDWARDSAFB) Conduct a preflight mission brief. The Squadron Operations
   Section will keep the TFC informed of FCIFs affecting the deployed team.
   A36.7.3. (EDWARDSAFB) File a DD Fm 175, Military Flight Plan, or appropriate flight
   plan.
   A36.7.4. (EDWARDSAFB) Flight-follow the deployed missions by radar and radio when
   possible. When flights will be conducted out of radar and radio coverage, brief specific
   departure and return procedures to the flight-following agency.
A36.8. (EDWARDSAFB) DEPLOYED EMERGENCIES. Report aircraft mishaps as
required by AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports. The TFC will ensure the Safety
Office at the deployed location and the Squadron Operations Officer are notified in a timely
manner. After hours and on weekends, pass information through the Edwards Command Post
(CP).
   A36.8.1. (EDWARDSAFB) If an individual is injured or develops a physical emergency,
   take the person to the nearest adequate medical facility for treatment. As soon as practical,
   relay information to the Squadron Operations Officer. After hours or on weekends, pass
   information through CP. Notify host base safety as required. Mission impact must be quickly
   evaluated and actions taken to minimize degradation. In no case is a person to fly on
   deployment aircraft with a debilitating illness.
