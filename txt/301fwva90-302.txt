The IG Complaints program in accordance with Air Force Instruction 90-301, Inspector General Complaints
Resolution, investigates possible violations of standards and provides redress or appeals where none already
exists.

            You have the right to file an IG complaint without fear of reprisal; but first, verify the facts and
             give your chain of command a chance to handle the problem.

            Typically complaints can best be solved by your commander or supervisor. We encourage you to
             talk to your IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR/ FIRST SERGEANT/UNIT COMMANDER/NEXT
             LEVEL COMMANDER (as appropriate) before coming to the IG. If you feel your issue can’t be
             resolved through your Chain-of-Command, you can bring your issue directly to the IG.

            If there is already a process in existence to handle your issue we will refer you to the appropriate
             agency to handle your complaint.

A hotline telephone has been setup for use in reporting fraud, waste and abuse: (817) 782-5989. Members may
also use the contacts above or the DoD Hotline at 800-424-9098.

Stop by, call or send us a letter. We will be happy to talk with you. If an issue needs immediate attention,
contact Lt Col John Moyer at office (817) 782-6875 or cellular telephone (817) 829-7152.
