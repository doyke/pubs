SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Major changes include defining Reliability, Availability, Maintainability for Pods (RAMPOD) as
the tool used for financial reporting to Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) for all
AF externally carried pods (including leased pods) and uses RAMPOD to account for pod assets
possessed by the ―Total Force‖ (Active Duty, Air National Guard, or US Air Force Reserve
Command). The use of possession purpose identifier (PPI) code "BU" is expanded. Clarifies
policy on the use of PPI codes "PJ" and "PR", and provides additional guidance on Operations
Group Aerospace Vehicle Utilization Monitor (OG AVUM) responsibilities. Additionally PPI
code ―BQ‖ is not authorized when the only reason for the communication with depot engineering
has been directed by technical order or previous disposition instructions on an existing condition.
Office symbols and publication references were updated throughout. Also, the process for
reporting aircraft possessed by depot/contract field teams has been updated. Finally, Chapter 5
has been deleted and Chapter 6 has been updated to provide current policy and procedures for all
Communication & Information maintainers.

                                 REPORTING GUIDELINES

1.1. Using Report Information. The Air Force uses the information from reports produced by
each reporting system mainly for accounting and analysis. Each reporting system also gives
basic historical management information and data on equipment availability and use to all levels
of command. Use this information to:
   1.1.1. Compute the official Air Force inventory.
   1.1.2. Build the Air Force programming documents and their related budget and staffing
   requirements.
   1.1.3. Produce statistical analysis for congressional committees, the Office of Management
   and Budget, and the Department of Defense.
   1.1.4. The MAJCOMs establish capability goals in coordination with the Air Staff to include
   but not limited to Mission Capable (MC), Total Not Mission Capable Maintenance
   (TNMCM), and Total Not Mission Capable Supply (TNMCS). These goals enable HQ
   USAF to assess resource allocation funding on a quarterly basis. The MC-rate goals and
   plans also go into the yearly DoD Materiel Readiness Report to Congress.
   1.1.5. Compute the official Air Force Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Information.
1.2. Correct Reporting. Because the Air Force uses reports named in this instruction to
develop and defend the US Air Force Plan, Program, and Budget, correct and timely reporting is
critical. Errors in reporting can cause the Air Force to lose needed funding, manpower
authorizations, and supplies.
1.3. Offices of Responsibility. The office of primary responsibility (OPR) for this instruction is
AF/A4LM, 1030 Air Force Pentagon, Washington D.C. 20330-1030. Offices of collateral
responsibility (OCR) are:
   1.3.1. AF Aerospace Vehicle Distribution Officer (AVDO) at HQ AFMC, 4375 Childlaw

        AIRCRAFT, DRONE, AND UNMANNED AEROSPACE SYSTEMS (UAS)
             INVENTORY, STATUS, AND UTILIZATION REPORTING

Section 2A—Reporting System Overview

2.1. Concepts.
   2.1.1. Each Aerospace Vehicle is always possessed by a designated Air Force reporting
   organization at either the organizational or depot level. The possessing organization or depot
   will report:
       2.1.1.1. The hours it possesses the aerospace vehicle.
       2.1.1.2. Changes in aerospace vehicle possession.
       2.1.1.3. Status conditions that affect an aerospace vehicle's ability to perform assigned
       missions.
       2.1.1.4. Flying hours and sorties.
   2.1.2. If a contractor controls or maintains an aircraft that needs inventory, status, and
   utilization reporting, the administrative contracting officer must submit the needed reports or
   information to the agency that asks for them, unless the applicable contract states otherwise.
   Use these reports whenever it is in the best interest of the Government.
   2.1.3. The Weapon System Program Manager is responsible for ensuring CFO data elements
   are properly reported in Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS) in a
   timely fashion:
       2.1.3.1. Establish the acquisition value of each asset (including the value of the GFM)
       once the asset is established in REMIS by the AF-AVDO.
       2.1.3.2. Determine which modification contracts (organic or contract installed) need to
       be capitalized for CFO reporting. Initially establish the modification records (serial
       number and average modification cost) for each asset being modified by the specific
       modification contract. Once the modification is completed on an asset, enter the specific
       completion date in REMIS to start the CFO reporting.
2.2. The Reporting System. Units process inventory, status and utilization data using an
approved Maintenance Information System (MIS). MAJCOMs, Field Operating Agencies
(FOAs), HQ AFMC, HQ USAF, and other authorized users of the Reliability and Maintainability
Information System (REMIS) database check the data.
2.3. Transmitting Data. Data will be sent to the REMIS database at specified times.

Section 2C—Aircraft Inventory Reporting

2.9. Assignment Procedure. Inventory reporting starts when an aircraft is accepted according
to this section and AF-AVDO at HQ AFMC initiates the first assignment procedure according to
AFI 16-402. 2.10 Possession Reporting.
   2.10.1. What to report as possessed inventory:
       2.10.1.1. All US Air Force-owned aircraft, including those on loan or lease to agencies
       outside the US Air Force as directed by HQ USAF.
       2.10.1.2. Non-US Air Force-owned aircraft as directed by HQ USAF.
   2.10.2. Procedures. When a unit or depot gains or losses possession of an aerospace vehicle,
   the unit or depot must:
       2.10.2.1. Start or stop possession reporting.
       2.10.2.2. Coordinate the gain/loss time of transfer with the reciprocating unit.
       2.10.2.3. Inform the base/depot engine manager of all aerospace vehicle losses, gains,
       and terminations by providing a copy of the appropriate e-mail message..
   2.10.3. Criteria and limitations for use of Possession Purpose Identifier (PPI) Codes BQ,
   BT, BU, PJ, and PR.
       2.10.3.1. PPI code "BQ" is NOT authorized when using an automated communication
       system (such as the AFMC Form 202, Nonconforming Technical Assistance Request and
       Reply Process) when the only reason for the communication with depot engineering has
       been directed by technical order or previous disposition instructions on an existing
       condition.
       2.10.3.2. "BQ" is authorized for use when the wing has submitted a request IAW TO 00-
       25-107, Maintenance Assistance, or thru an automated system to request depot assistance
       with an NMC condition preventing the aircraft from flying, requesting a depot team,
       equipment, or funding is anticipated from MAJCOM and the following conditions are
       met:
          2.10.3.2.1. No additional field level scheduled or unscheduled NMC driver(s) are in-
          work, (e.g.. Phase).
          2.10.3.2.2. The unit lacks capability to correct the deficiency at field level and the
          condition has been validated by Quality Assurance as a depot level repair.
       2.10.3.3. MAJCOMs shall approve the use of PPI Code ―BT‖.
       2.10.3.4. "BU" is authorized to prepare an aircraft 3 duty days prior to the start of a
       depot/contract field team. "BU" is also authorized for up to 5 duty days after depot level
       maintenance for rebuilding the aircraft and completing operational checks. During this
       rebuild period, under no circumstances will parts be cannibalized from the aircraft while
       in "BU" PPI code. Prior to any cannibalization action(s), units must regain the aircraft in
       its primary PPI code.
          2.10.3.4.1. If other major field level maintenance, i.e. phase, is in-work, BU is only
          authorized for the portion of time that depot level work is actually being performed.
AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010                                                               17


          2.10.3.4.2. BU - Repair instructions outlined in field level technical orders do not
          constitute depot level repair and use of PPI code BU.
       2.10.3.5. "PJ" is authorized for use from the first day of crating preparation until arrival
       at new location, reassembly, and ground operational checks are completed. Upon receipt
       the aircraft may be possessed in this code no longer than 10 duty days. If an aircraft is
       not reassembled or placed in PPI code "PR" after 10 duty days, the aircraft must be
       changed back to its primary code and the current maintenance status will be reported (i.e.
       NMC).
       2.10.3.6. "PR" is authorized for attrition reserve aircraft and remotely operated aircraft in
       storage. The aircraft must be mission capable (FMC or PMC) prior to being placed in
       storage and maintained in an MC condition. Aircraft can move from PJ directly to PR
       provided the MC requirement was met before shipment. Units will continue to monitor
       air vehicles in PPI code PR or PJ to ensure fleet health is maintained. If a cannibalization
       action that creates an NMC condition is required, the air vehicle must be removed from
       PPI code "PR" and status changed to reflect the air vehicles current maintenance status
       (i.e. NMCS). Once aircraft are placed in PPI code PR or PJ, the unit will notify
       MAJCOM-AVDO of the code change thru normal AFI 21-103 message reporting
       channels. Air vehicles in PPI code PR or PJ will continue to be tracked on a daily status
       sheet to ensure continued fleet health is maintained.
2.11. Criteria for Gaining or Losing Possession. Possession of an aircraft changes when:
   2.11.1. The flight crew of the gaining organization accepts and leaves with the aerospace
   vehicle unless otherwise stated in an inter-command Memorandum of Agreement (MOA).
   The time of possession change is the actual time the aircraft takes off from the losing
   organization. For aircraft moved in a "PJ" purpose identifier, the possession changes at the
   time the Traffic Management Flight (TMF) of the gaining organization accepts the aircraft.
   2.11.2. The flight crew of the losing organization, or a neutral flight crew, delivers the
   aircraft. The time of possession changes when the engines shut down at the gaining base.
   Note: The Air Combat Command Air Operations Squadron ACC/AOS aircrew is considered
   a neutral crew if they are not assigned to the losing or gaining unit. Because flying hour
   sorties and hours are directly tied to aircraft possession the unit that possesses the aircraft
   IAW the rules outlined above will receive flying hour/sortie credit unless otherwise specified
   in a MAJCOM approved MOA. This MOA must be coordinated and approved by the
   MAJCOM AVDO prior to the aircraft transfer.
   2.11.3. In the event, an aerospace vehicle is damaged or destroyed:
       2.11.3.1. The nearest base with the necessary repair or reclamation capability takes
       possession. The time of possession change is the time of landing or crash.
       2.11.3.2. Possession does not change if the parent organization does the repair,
       reclamation or termination; however the unit AVDO must initiate the proper station
       location code and possession purpose identifier changes.
   2.11.4. In the event, a transient aircraft requires maintenance lasting more than 7 calendar
   days:
18                                               AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010


     2.11.4.1. The organization performing the maintenance gains possession of the aircraft
     when it is known the work cannot be completed in 7 days.
     2.11.4.2. Do not change possession if the parent organization does the maintenance. The
     unit AVDO must change the station location code and the possession purpose identifier
     to "BL."
     2.11.4.3. Do not transfer possession for AMC aircraft in transit at bases where AMC has
     transient or en-route maintenance responsibility unless depot assistance is required.
     2.11.4.4. Do not transfer possession for KC-10 aircraft unless depot assistance is
     required.
  2.11.5. An authorized government representative accepts an aircraft from a contractor on
  behalf of the Air Force. In this situation:
     2.11.5.1. AFMC becomes the first possessing activity for new production aircraft. AF-
     AVDO at HQ AFMC processes the gain in coordination with the respective ALC
     program office.
  2.11.6. (Added-AETC) The actual acceptance, operational use (utilization), or designation
  of responsibility for an aircraft changes. Aircraft Purpose Possession Identifier (PPI) code
  "BT" is not automatically authorized for acceptance and transfer activities. If PPI ―BT‖ is
  required as a direct result of NMC maintenance conditions directly attributed to depot,
  contract field teams (CFT) or transfer activities, a formal request must be approved by HQ
  AETC/A4MAA-AVDO.
     2.11.6.1. (Added-AETC) Units are authorized the use of "BK" possession when
     aerospace vehicles are being processed through a major command-directed funded and
     operated maintenance program, however this code must be approved by MAJCOM HQs
     prior to use. (For Little Rock AFB: The use of "BK" possession is authorized for locally
     directed C-130 refurbishment program.) It is not to be used when aircraft are undergoing
     unscheduled maintenance, (for example, corrosion repair), scheduled inspections, or time
     compliance technical orders (TCTO). The following guidelines apply:
         2.11.6.1.1. (Added-AETC) The use of possession purpose code "BK" is only
         authorized for a total of 15 work or duty days to strip, prepare, and paint an aircraft.
         EXCEPTION: Little Rock AFB is authorized a total of 20 work or duty days.
         2.11.6.1.2. (Added-AETC) At any time during the painting process (see paragraph
         2.11.7.1.1 of this supplement), if maintenance other than stripping, preparing, or
         painting is performed on the aircraft, then the aircraft will be turned to "TF"
         possession and the status changed appropriately. The aircraft may be returned to
         "BK" to complete the paint once the maintenance action has been stopped. However,
         the total number of "BK" days will not exceed 15 work or duty days.
         2.11.6.1.3. (Added-AETC) If more than 15 work or duty days are required by the
         unit, send a formal message to HQ AETC/A4MA, and A4MAA-AVDO, requesting
         the additional days. Include justification for the extension request, and an estimated
         completion date. For Little Rock AFB: If more than 20 work or duty days are
         required, send a formal message to HQ AETC/A4MSS, A4MA, and A4MAA-AVDO
AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010                                                             19


           requesting the additional days. Include justification for the extension request, and an
           estimated completion date.
           2.11.6.1.4. (Added-AETC) Aircraft temporarily transferred for bead blasting may
           remain in "BK" possession with MAJCOM approval if corrosion discrepancies are
           discovered which must be repaired before returning to home station.
           2.11.6.1.5. (Added-AETC) When an aircraft is transferred for bead blasting and
           discrepancies are discovered which must be repaired before returning to home station
           (other than corrosion discrepancies), place the aircraft into possession purpose code
           "TF" and the status will change from FMC to the appropriate status.
2.12. Criteria for Terminating Possession. Possession terminates when vehicles become
training aids or transferred to the National Museum United States Air Force or at the time the
aerospace vehicle meets the termination requirements of this instruction and AFI 16-402.
Termination codes can be found in the Air Force Data Dictionary. Terminate the aerospace
vehicle and cease reporting if it has permanently transferred to non-Air Force activities such as:
   2.12.1. Foreign countries, as applicable.
   2.12.2. Other DoD agencies, such as US Army or US Navy.
   2.12.3. Other Government agencies.
   2.12.4. USAF Heritage Program.
   2.12.5. DRMS.
2.13. Criteria for Reporting Aircraft as Deployed. When sending aerospace vehicles for use
at other locations or for specialized maintenance (other than that done by a depot), list such
movements and their possession accountability according to the criteria contained in paragraphs
2.13.1. through 2.13.5.
   2.13.1. Satellite Operation and Detachment. An aircraft is in a satellite operation or
   detachment when it is moved to another station and the parent command unit continues to
   operate and support it. Note: Do not change possession accountability unless directed by an
   Operation Plan (OPLAN). The possessing command is the command to which the flying
   hours are allocated.
   2.13.2. Rotations. An aircraft is on rotation when direct responsibility for its operation or
   support changes between CONUS or overseas activities, commands, or units.
       2.13.2.1. Since the flying hours are allocated according to PA documents, MAJCOMs
       may not change possession accountability unless the host organization is within their own
       command.
       2.13.2.2. When the aircraft moves as a part of a total unit movement that will not
       integrate under a host control, the possessing organization stays the same or changes as
       stated in the OPLAN.
       2.13.2.3. Change in station location may be made by MAJCOM option.
       2.13.2.4. All reporting is done according to the OPLAN.
 20                                              AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010


      2.13.2.5. MAJCOMs must include the time of transfer in the OPLAN describing the
      movement.
   2.13.3. Supporting Exercises.
      2.13.3.1. The OPLAN must state possession accountability for aircraft moved to support
      intra-command, inter-command, or inter-service missions.
      2.13.3.2. If the PA document uniquely allocates the flying hours or utilization for the
      aircraft, the command to which the flying hours are allocated is always the possessing
      command.
   2.13.4. Consolidated or Centralized Repair Activities. When you move an aircraft for
   corrosion control, refurbishment, or other maintenance, normal reporting procedures apply
   unless otherwise directed by the MAJCOM AVDO or Lead Command approved MOA.
   2.13.5. Loaned Aircraft. Possession changes to the command and unit having direct
   responsibility for using and supporting the aircraft. The MAJCOM AVDO(s) or operational
   order directs the change.
2.14. Possession Reporting Criteria for Depot Teams. If an aircraft goes in for maintenance
by contract or depot field teams, transfer possession according to these criteria:
   2.14.1. For field teams (depot or contract) performing maintenance or modifications, the
   owning unit AVDO reports possession changes for both the owning and depot units.
      2.14.1.1. Transfer possession to AFMC in purpose identifier "DJ" when the operating
      command receives formal AFMC acknowledgment of repair responsibility per TO 00-25-
      107, but before the team starts the repair.
      2.14.1.2. Change possession to purpose identifier "DM" when the depot field team
      begins maintenance, repair, or modification on the aircraft.
      2.14.1.3. Change the aircraft possession purpose identifier to "DR" only if an AFMC
      aircrew will perform a Functional Check Flight (FCF).
      2.14.1.4. Possession returns to the proper organization if:
          2.14.1.4.1. The aircraft has received all assigned work and the required operational
          check or FCF (if part of the workload agreement) is accomplished.
          2.14.1.4.2. The host or operating organization receives, accepts, and controls the
          aircraft.
          2.14.1.4.3. The host or operating organization accomplishes a permanent inventory
          loss transaction (―TP‖).
   2.14.2. Other Field Teams. If an aircraft receives depot field team maintenance, other than
   stated above, the command with control responsibilities over the team doing the work
   possesses the aircraft.
      2.14.2.1. Specific responsibilities must be stated in the workload agreement.
      2.14.2.2. The host unit must do the required inventory reporting.
AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010                                                             21


2.14. (AETC) Possession Reporting Criteria for Depot Teams. Units awaiting depot
assistance will follow the instructions in AFI 21-103, paragraphs 2.14 through 2.14.2.2 when
depot assistance conditions are encountered.
2.15. Notifying MAJCOMs of Possession Changes.
   2.15.1. Accurate reporting of possession changes is essential in order for the Air Force to
   accurately account for the location and use of the aircraft inventory. MAJCOMs determine
   procedures for reporting changes of possession within the command. Possession change
   messages are required on aircraft transfers between commands. For aircraft transfers, both
   reporting organizations must use the same ZULU time and date.
2.16. Gain Message, Aerospace Equipment Possession Change Report. The unit or depot
AVDO of the organization gaining the aircraft sends a priority gain e-mail message not later than
the first workday after the possession changes. See Attachment 10 for a sample gain message
and instructions for preparing it. This report is designated emergency status code (ESC) C-1.
Continue reporting during emergency conditions, priority precedence. Submit data requirements
assigned this category as prescribed or by any means to ensure arrival on published due dates.
2.17. Loss Message Aerospace Equipment Possession Change Report. The unit or depot
AVDO of the organization losing possession of an aircraft sends a priority loss e-mail message
not later than the first workday after the possession change takes place. On new production
aircraft where engines are tracked as outlined in TO 00-25-254-1 series publications, the Air
Force program office will include engine serial numbers on the loss message. See Attachment
11 for a sample loss message and instructions for preparing it. This report is designated
emergency status code (ESC) C-1. Continue reporting during emergency conditions, priority
precedence. Submit data requirements assigned this category as prescribed or by any means to
ensure arrival on published due dates.
2.18. Termination Message, Aerospace Equipment Termination Report. The unit or depot
AVDO of the organization losing accountability of an aircraft must send a priority termination e-
mail message not later than the first workday after it has been decided the aircraft should be
terminated. See Attachment 12 for a sample termination message and instructions for preparing
it. This report is designated emergency status code (ESC) C-1. Continue reporting during
emergency conditions, priority precedence. Submit data requirements assigned this category as
prescribed or by any means to ensure arrival on published due dates. Note: If a losing
organization has removed the engine/s from an aircraft prior to the aircraft being terminated then
the aircraft termination message must state at item 11 that no engine/s were installed on the
aircraft. For aircraft being terminated by Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group
(AMARG), engine serial numbers do not need to be listed on the termination message. The
AMARG Engine Manager must continue to report all engines according to AFI 21-104, Selective
Management of Selected Gas Turbine Engines and TO 00-25-254-1/ -2, Comprehensive Engine
Management System.
2.19. Possession Purpose Identifier Code Change Message, A erospace Equipment
Possession Purpose Identifier Code Change Report. When changing a possession purpose
identifier, the possessing unit or depot AVDO must send a priority message, via an email, not
later than the first workday after the change. See Attachment 13 for a sample possession
purpose identifier change message and instructions for preparing it. This report is designated
emergency status code (ESC) C-1. Continue reporting during emergency conditions, priority
 22                                               AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010


precedence. Submit data requirements assigned this category as prescribed or by any means to
ensure arrival on published due dates.
2.19. (AETC) Possession Purpose Identifier Code Change Message (RCS: HAF-
ILM(AR)9482, Aerospace Equipment Possession Purpose Identifier Code Change Report).
When the possession code changes, send a priority message to HQ AETC/A4MAA-AVDO.
Include HQ AFMC/A4RC-AVDO, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, and the applicable AFMC system
program director as information addressees. Only one message is required when aircraft
possession is changed between AETC bases. The gaining organization prepares the message if
the losing organization ferries the aircraft. The losing organization prepares the message if the
gaining organization ferries the aircraft. Units are authorized to submit one AFI 21-103
possession purpose identifier code change message per day with all possession code changes for
that day.
2.20. Mission,    Design,    and    Series    (MDS)/Configuration       Identifier  Change
Message, Aerospace Equipment MDS/Configuration Identifier Change Report. The AVDO
of the organization changing the MDS or configuration identifier must send a
MDS/configuration identifier change e-mail message. Obtain proper authorization from the
MAJCOM AVDO before making the change, and send a priority message not later than the first
workday after the change. See Attachment 14 for a sample MDS/Configuration identifier
change message and instructions for preparing it. This report is designated emergency status
code (ESC) C-1. Continue reporting during emergency conditions, normal precedence. Submit
data requirements in this category as prescribed, or as soon as possible after submission of
priority reports.
2.21. How To Determine Codes. Attachment 4 lists the references used in inventory reporting
under this instruction.

Section 2D—Aircraft Logistics Status Reporting

2.22. Reporting Maintenance Status. The reporting requirements in this section are exempt
from licensing in accordance with paragraph 2.11.3 of AFI 33-324, The Information Collections
and Reports Management Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force
Information Collections.
   2.22.1. Use multiple status reporting to the maximum extent the MIS allows. Multiple
   Status meaning an aircraft can be broken for more than one condition at the same time.
   2.22.2. MAJCOMs will not include possession purpose identifiers codes BJ, BK, BL, BN,
   BO, BQ, BR, BU, BT, PJ, PL, PM, PN, PR, TJ, TX, XJ, XR, XS, XT, XU, and XW when
   computing and developing rates and standards for individual organizations. Note: To
   determine the possession purpose identifier codes to use for calculating status metrics refer to
   TO 00-20-2-WA-1, Appendix L.
   2.22.2. (AETC) Access Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS) transaction identifier,
   possession identifier inquiry (PII), AFCSM 21-564, Volume II, Status and Inventory
   Reporting, for an online display of available possession codes. The PII lists codes used in
   computing equipment possession time, and categorizes possession code used in computing
   reportable equipment status.
AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010                                                                23


   2.22.3. Status reporting for permanently assigned Ground Instructional Trainer Aircraft
   (GITA) is not required.
2.23. Determining Maintenance Status.
   2.23.1. Attachment 2 gives a list of maintenance and condition status codes and their
   definitions, which are based on DoDI 3110.5, Material Condition Reporting for Mission-
   Essential Systems and Equipment. These codes describe the capability of an aerospace
   vehicle to do its assigned missions, that is, a unit's specifically assigned wartime, training, or
   test missions as specified in:
      2.23.1.1. The unit's Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statements.
      2.23.1.2. Unit training syllabuses.
      2.23.1.3. Test mission requirements.
      2.23.1.4. Mission Essential Subsystems List (MESL).
   2.23.2. Report any aircraft not Full Mission Capable (FMC) with a maintenance status code
   determined by the following criteria:
      2.23.2.1. Report an aircraft that can perform at least one, but not all of its assigned
      missions as Partial Mission Capable (PMC). Report an aircraft that cannot perform any
      of its assigned missions as Not Mission Capable (NMC).
      2.23.2.2. Add the letter M (maintenance), S (supply), or B (both maintenance and
      supply) to show the reason the aircraft is PMC or NMC.
      2.23.2.3. Aircraft in codes NMCM and NMCB also show if the needed maintenance is
      scheduled (S) or unscheduled (U).
      2.23.2.4. The dual status condition--Not Mission Capable Both (NMCB) or Partial
      Mission Capable Both (PMCB)--starts when an aircraft requires both maintenance and
      supplies.
      2.23.2.5. Change an existing maintenance or supply condition to the dual condition if
      discovering a second problem. For example, when an aircraft is in NMCM maintenance
      status code and then you find a supply problem (NMCS), change the reported status to
      NMCB.
      2.23.2.6. Change the dual condition when you have rectified either the maintenance or
      the supply problem. For example, if you fix the maintenance problem before the supply
      problem, change the NMCB status code to NMCS (or vice versa from NMCB to NMCM
      when part becomes available but maintenance is not).
      2.23.2.7. Work Unit Codes (WUC). WUCs are an important part of the MIS status
      reporting. They determine subsystem problems and repair actions associated with a piece
      of equipment or a system. A proper WUC is required to be entered into the MIS status
      reporting when an equipment problem is discovered or repaired. If a specific WUC is not
      known initially due to troubleshooting, then a system or subsystem WUC may be used
      until the faulty component is identified. When the equipment is returned to service or
      when parts are placed on order, it is the expeditor‘s responsibility to provide MOC with
24                                                 AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010


     the proper WUC to be used for the PMC or NMC status reporting period. The use of
     __000 and or __00 must not be used when a more specific WUC is available.
  2.23.3. Scheduled or unscheduled maintenance status stops when you finish maintenance
  according to applicable technical data using the following criteria:
     2.23.3.1. When all ground operations checks and cure checks are complete.
     2.23.3.2. If in-flight operational checks are required by technical data, maintenance
     status will stop when all ground checks leading up to the in-flight operational check are
     completed.
     2.23.3.3. When you verify a lack of parts limits the mission.
     2.23.3.4. If a Functional Check Flight (FCF) is required IAW TO 1-1-300, -6 FCF
     requirements, or any other applicable technical data, maintenance status will not stop
     until the FCF is completed.
     2.23.3.4. (AETC) Report aircraft undergoing a functional check flight (FCF) due to a
     maintenance requirement (scheduled or unscheduled) as not mission capable maintenance
     airworthy (flyable) until released.
     2.23.3.5. (Added-AETC) Policy guidance for status reporting of impounded aircraft.
     Once impounded, (nonmission capable) NMC status will continue until released by the
     impoundment release authority.
  2.23.4. Supply status starts after all of these actions occur:
     2.23.4.1. You find the aircraft requires an essential part.
     2.23.4.2. You make a valid demand on supply and/or depot. Note: When the Engine
     Manager makes a demand on depot for supported replacement engine to fill an aircraft
     hole for which no serviceable or repairable asset is available at the unit.
     2.23.4.3. Maintenance verifies the part is essential.
     2.23.4.4. Maintenance and supply together verify that the needed part (serviceable or
     reparable and not awaiting parts) is not available on base (does not apply to Contract
     Logistics Support (CLS) or Contract Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS)
     provided parts).
  2.23.5. Supply time stops when maintenance receives the part(s). If maintenance cannot
  accept the part(s) when they are available, supply status time stops at the time supply
  attempts to deliver the part(s). Note: Supply time will continue if a part is received from
  LRS supply activities but must be sent off-base to a contractor facility/depot for additional
  adjustments/configuring/programming/drilling, etc. In this instance the supply time will stop
  when the part is returned to maintenance from off base.
  2.23.6. When you find an aircraft discrepancy during flight, maintenance status starts at the
  time the aircraft returns to its parking spot/engine shutdown.
  2.23.7. When you find an aircraft discrepancy during ground operation, maintenance status
  starts at the time you found the discrepancy.
AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010                                                            25


      2.23.7.1. It is imperative that aircraft status accurately reflects the capability of the
      aircraft to perform its assigned missions. While the majority of red X discrepancies
      require an aircraft to be reported in a not-mission capable condition, some red X entries
      do not. These entries do not necessarily affect the status or the mission capability of the
      aircraft and do not require a maintenance repair action. Examples of red X entries that do
      not affect the status and mission capability are:
          2.23.7.1.1. External tanks/pylons ejector cartridges removed
          2.23.7.1.2. Openings/panels taped/covered prior to and during a wash
          2.23.7.1.3. Protective covers installed
          2.23.7.1.4. Ejection seats de-armed for static display/training
          2.23.7.1.5. Reconfiguration/installation/removal of Primary Mission Equipment
          (PME). This is not intended to be an all-encompassing list as there may be other red
          X entries that fall into this category.
   2.23.8. When maintenance places an MC aircraft into scheduled maintenance on the printed
   flying schedule/maintenance plan, the status changes only if you determine that maintenance
   cannot, and will not return the aircraft to a MC status within 2 hours.
   2.23.8. (AETC) Scheduled maintenance is defined as required maintenance actions that are
   planned and published within the daily portion of the weekly utilization and maintenance
   schedule.
      2.23.8.1. For example, if maintenance performs Planned Scheduled Maintenance on an
      otherwise MC aircraft and can and will return, or is scheduled to return, the aircraft to
      MC status within 2 hours, do not report it as NMC.
      2.23.8.2. As another example, when you find a discrepancy during scheduled
      maintenance that causes the aircraft to be declared NMC, and maintenance will need
      more than 2 hours to return the aircraft to MC status, NMC status starts when you find
      the discrepancy.
   2.23.9. Aircraft entering phase, periodic, Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP), or
   isochronal inspections will be coded NMC using the support general work unit code (WUC)
   for the look phase/inspection. The NMC time using the support general WUC will start
   when the work cards are initiated and continue through the look phase/inspection. Normal
   NMC-driver WUC reporting applies after the look phase is complete.
   2.23.10. Management uses certain groupings of status codes to perform summaries,
   analyses, briefings, and so on. These groupings show total supply and maintenance
   limitations. A complete list of these groupings appear in Attachment 2.
2.24. Pacing Items.
   2.24.1. Units will report the WUC for the mission limiting condition that will take the
   longest for maintenance to correct on an aircraft in PMC and NMC status. Units will use a
   minimum of the 3 digit WUC when reporting the driving NMC condition. All maintenance
   status codes are defined and associated with a condition status code as shown in Attachment
   2. Note: For aircraft with systems awaiting operational check, units will report the status of
   the next highest NMC/PMC driver (if another mission limiting system is reported). Status
 26                                              AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010


   reported will not be below that of system requiring operational check. When all mission
   limiting conditions are corrected, the unit will then report the system requiring operational
   check as the system driver.
   2.24.2. When accomplishing single/multiple status reporting, use the following order of
   precedence, from most severe to least severe: Note: All Mission Capability (MICAP) write-
   ups must be input. NMCBS, NMCBU, NMCS, NMCMS, NMCMU, NMCBSA, NMCBUA,
   NMCSA, NMCMSA, NMCMUA, PMCB, PMCS, PMCM, FMC
2.25. Minimum Essential Subsystems List (MESL).
   2.25.1. MESLs lay the groundwork for reporting the status of aircraft capability. They list
   the minimum essential systems and subsystems that must work on an aircraft for it to
   perform specifically assigned unit wartime, training, test or other missions. The MESL
   brings together the Full Systems List (FSL) and the Basic Systems List (BSL).
      2.25.1.1. The BSL lists a unit's specifically assigned wartime, training, and test missions
      and the systems and subsystems that must work for a unit to accomplish those missions.
      2.25.1.2. The FSL lists all systems and subsystems needed for Full Mission Performance.
      It lists the essential systems and subsystems that must work to do all BSL missions
      (specifically assigned unit wartime, training, or test missions), and other kinds of unit
      sorties such as Program Depot Maintenance (PDM) delivery flights, aircraft transfer
      flights, cross-countries, or other training sorties units fly.
   2.25.2. The MESL allows you to compare aircraft systems, subsystems, and components, by
   WUC, against the FSL and BSL across the page. In each column, mark the equipment that
   must work with an "X".
   2.25.3. A system may have an "X" in the FSL column only or in the FSL column and any or
   all of the BSL columns.
      2.25.3.1. If there is an "X" in the FSL column only, the equipment does not have any
      specifically assigned unit wartime, training, or test mission. The equipment may have
      other kinds of unit sorties or missions to fly such as those listed in paragraph 2.25.1.2.
      2.25.3.2. If there is an "X" in the FSL column and any or all of the BSL columns, the
      equipment must be operational for the mission identified by the column heading.
      2.25.3.3. If any system or subsystem with an "X" in the FSL column only is not working,
      put the aircraft in maintenance status code PMC.
   2.25.4. If any system or subsystem with an "X" in the FSL and all BSL columns is not
   working, the aircraft cannot do any mission and is status code NMC. If any BSL column
   does not have an "X" for the inoperative system, the status code is PMC.
   2.25.5. Determine the adverse impact of non-working components within listed systems or
   sub-systems on a case-by-case basis. Components may appear on a MESL if the component
   is the only part of the subsystem that must be operational.
   2.25.6. For degraded system performance evaluations, decide whether the overall system or
   sub-system can still support applicable mission requirements.
AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010                                                            27


   2.25.7. Units with aircraft not equipped, and/or not programmed to be equipped, with a listed
   system or subsystem should not report status on that equipment, unless the MESL states
   otherwise.
   2.25.8. (Added-AETC) Minimum Essential Subsystems Lists (MESL) for AETC-assigned
   aircraft are located at
   https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/DocMan/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO-LG-
   AE-27-2-5&Filter=OO-LG-AE-27. Operating restrictions specified in AFI 21-101, AETC
   SUP, Aircraft and Equipment Management, and aircraft technical orders (TO) take
   precedence when determining acceptability for flight. Minimum requirements for a FCF are
   determined by the profile required and the FCF pilot. One-time flight procedures are
   specified in 00-20-series TOs.
      2.25.8.1. (Added-AETC) All MESLs for AETC assigned aircraft will be posted and
      maintained current by the respective Weapons System Manager (WSM) assigned to HQ
      AETC/A4MA and published under the authority of this instruction.
      2.25.8.2. (Added-AETC) Units may submit request for changes on AETC Form 1236.
      When changes are required, WSMs will update MESLs as required and change the date
      on the MESL to reflect the most current product. All changes will be coordinated with
      affected offices (AETC/A3R, 19 AF/DO, A4M affected branches, etc.) and approved by
      AETC/A4M. When changes occur, WSMs will notify affected units to ensure the most
      current MESL is available.
      2.25.8.3. (Added-AETC) WSMs will accomplish a complete review of their respective
      MESLs for currency and relevancy in conjunction with the 2 year review of this
      supplement IAW AFI 33-360, Publication Management Program.
      2.25.8.4. (Added-AETC) Each unit's training syllabus determines applicability of basic
      system list (BSL) columns. Qualifying note codes are used in the MESL to help explain
      degraded mission systems that are complex or redundant and to define aircraft
      exceptions.
2.26. Developing the MESL. MESLs will be developed in accordance with AFPD 10-9.
MAJCOMs must make sure MESLs list only the minimum essential aircraft systems or
subsystems that must work in order for a unit to accomplish its mission. A sample MESL is
shown in Figure 2.1
   2.26.1. Units can fly missions and sorties other than specifically assigned wartime, training,
   or test missions. Since the FSL is an all-inclusive list, build it to include all systems and
   subsystems on any or all BSLs and those required for sorties and missions not specifically
   assigned to that unit by the DOC, aircrew training, or flight test taskings.
   2.26.2. The MESL does not portray the role these "other" type missions and sorties may
   play. The aerospace vehicle status will be PMC if an inoperative system or subsystem is on
   the FSL only because of the limitation to full mission performance.
   2.26.3. MESL BSL columns show standard mission codes for specific wartime, aircrew
   training, and test missions assigned to a unit. MAJCOMs may build and use additional
   unique mission codes when needed as long as the codes are standardized within the
   MAJCOM. Standard MESL mission codes are listed in Attachment 3.
    28                                          AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010


      2.26.4. AFMC has sole responsibility and authority to develop and implement MESLs for
      Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) missions and aircraft in support of
      RDT&E.

Note: GENERAL: Rear Cockpit Systems/Subsystems/Components Not Required to be
Operational for BSLs.
1. Manual mode only required.
2. As required by AFI 11-202 Volume 3, General Flight Rules.
3. When equipped.
4. HAVE QUICK/Secure Voice required if aircraft is modified.
5. All eight AIM-7/AIM-9 stations required for FMC any combination of six required for
PMC.
6. Conformal fuel system required when equipped.
7. Excludes HUD camera - 74KEO.
8. F-15B and F-15D must be external ECM pod capable.
9. Strip lighting required as a minimum.
2.27. Determining Aircraft Maintenance Status and Capability.
   2.27.1. The MESL does not determine airworthiness or "safety-of-flight": Technical data,
   maintenance crews and aircrew judgment alone determine airworthiness. Do not use the
   MESL to gauge "go/ no-go" decisions.
   2.27.2. The maintenance status NMC Airworthy (Condition status codes K,L,M,N,P) must
   be used when an aircraft cannot accomplish the units wartime, training or test mission, but is
   still Airworthy (Safe for flight).
   2.27.3. You may deploy an NMC Airworthy aircraft as long as it can be returned to MC
   status (FMC or PMC) at an employment site.
   2.27.4. An aircraft is FMC if:
       2.27.4.1. All systems, subsystems, and components having an "X" in the FSL column are
       working (the aircraft can do all missions and sorties).
       2.27.4.2. A system, subsystem, or component having an "X" in the FSL column or any
       BSL column is degraded but is still capable of full mission performance.
   2.27.5. An aircraft is PMC if:
       2.27.5.1. One or more systems, subsystems, or components are not working and have an
       "X" in the FSL column only (the aircraft can do all BSL missions but is not fully
       equipped or capable of full mission performance).
       2.27.5.2. Systems, subsystems, or components that are not working and are not needed
       for unit specifically assigned wartime missions but, are needed for safe aircraft operation
       during peacetime (safety-of-flight discrepancies).
       2.27.5.3. One or more systems, subsystems, or components are not working and have an
       "X" in the FSL column and in at least one, but not all, BSL columns (the aircraft can do
       at least one, but not all, of its BSL missions).
       2.27.5.4. A system, subsystem, or component is degraded and has an "X" in the FSL
       column and all BSL columns but can support some of its BSL missions.
   2.27.6. An aircraft is NMC if:
 30                                                  AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010


       2.27.6.1. One or more systems, subsystems, or components having an "X" in the FSL
       column and all BSL columns are not working (the aircraft cannot do any BSL missions).
       2.27.6.2. The aircraft is "grounded" (not flyable).
       2.27.6.3. The aircraft cannot fly any of the unit's BSL missions. Note: The engineer at
       the ALC may approve the aircraft for a one-time flight to a maintenance facility.
   2.27.7. Use the Aircraft Maintenance Status Code Flow Chart in Table 2.1. to help
   determine the proper aircraft maintenance and condition status codes to report.

Section 2E—Aircraft Utilization Reporting Note: Not Applicable to UAS’s.

2.28. Flying Hour Program. Tracking and reconciling is the responsibility of the AVUM with
the Director of Operations being responsible for reporting. However, maintenance Debrief is
responsible for entering flying hours from the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight
Data Document into the MIS. Guidance for completing AFTO Form 781 can be found in TO 00-
20-1, AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance
Management, and this instruction.
   2.28.1. Maintenance Operations Flight (MOF) PS&D and OG AVUM will develop and
   implement policies and procedures to validate sorties and hours flown. Additionally, unit‘s
   MOC will reconcile uncompleted sorties daily in the MIS. Operations Squadron (OS)
   monitor will validate total sorties/hours flown and total sorties/hours flown for the month to
   date. Units may use the daily sortie reconciliation aspect of Maintenance Scheduling
   Application Tool (MSAT) instead of the printed copies of the Aircraft Utilization Report
   (AUR). Mobility Air Force (MAF) units may use equivalent G081 screens.
   2.28.2. The MOF PS&D will send an electronic copy of the MSAT product or the AUR to
   the AMU debriefing section, and OS monitors. Debriefing sections and OS monitors will
   reconcile sorties and hours flown on the AUR. If a disparity exists, the debriefer/OS monitor
   will annotate the difference on the AUR with the debriefer correcting the MIS. If an
   agreement cannot be made on the disparity, Maintenance Operations Squadron (MOS) PS&D
   will coordinate with the OG AVUM for appropriate action. A signed copy of the agreed
   upon daily AUR (signed by debrief) will be maintained by the OS monitor for three months.
   OS monitors will send the final AUR to the OG AVUM and AVDO upon closing-out the
   month.
      2.28.2.1. The OG AVUM and AVDO will compare the flying hours in the MIS (REMIS
      or GCSS Air Force Data Services) with flying hours in the MAJCOM sanctioned flying
      hour program database monthly to ensure the data in the MIS represents hours flown.
      MIS flying hour data is the official reporting source, completeness and accuracy of flying
      hours is a joint endeavor.
   2.28.3. The OG AVUM will submit a monthly flying hour report to the MAJCOM for the
   previous month‘s flying hours. The monthly flying hour report is due to the MAJCOM
   AVUM NLT the 5th calendar day of each month.
      2.28.3.1. The monthly flying hour report will only include those hours that were reported
      and reconciled in the MIS as 2400 on the 4th calendar day of the following month. Any
      hours or changes reported after that will be included as late time in the following months
      report.
      2.28.3.2. The AVUM and AVDO will compare the flying hours in the MIS (REMIS or
      GCSS Air Force Data Services) with flying hours in the MAJCOM sanctioned flying
      hour program database monthly to ensure the data in the MIS represents hours flown.
   2.28.4. The AVUM will submit a monthly flying hour report to the MAJCOM for the
   previous month‘s flying hours. The monthly flying hour report is due to the MAJCOM
   AVUM NLT the 5th calendar day of each month.
 32                                               AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010


       2.28.4.1. The monthly flying hour report will only include those hours that were reported
       and reconciled in the MIS as 2400 on the 4th calendar day of the following month. Any
       hours or changes reported after that will be included as late time in the following months
       report.
2.29. Aircraft Utilization Reporting Concept. Report unit or depot flying hours and sorties by
Program Element Code (PEC) and mission symbol for each possessed aircraft. This data helps
determine future inspection and modification requirements including the Aircraft Structural
Integrity Program (ASIP) and Reliability and Maintainability Programs. MIS data must be input
no later than midnight the fourth calendar day of the following month. Any flying time reported
after the fourth calendar day will be reported in the next month's data in MIS. The reporting
requirements in this section are exempt from licensing in accordance with AFI 33-324.
   2.29.1. Each MAJCOM's utilization data automatically updates REMIS. If the possessing
   unit is not in the command allocated the hours to be flown, the MAJCOM AVDO credits the
   hours to the assigned command by using the "L" (loan) indicator in REMIS.
   2.29.1. (AETC) Complete the flying hour report provided by HQ AETC/A3RA. Send
   report by most expedient means available to HQ AETC/A3RA, A4MMA, A4MAA-AVDO,
   SEF, and 19 AF/A3, and A4 no later than 1430 Central Standard Time (CST) on the 5th
   calendar workday of the following month.
       2.29.1.1. The utilization monitor in the MAJCOM will credit the hours to the assigned
       unit.
   2.29.2. The reporting period is based on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The first day of the
   new GMT month, the flying hours are reported for the new month.
       2.29.2.1. If the base or MAJCOM is reporting flying hours on aircraft at locations other
       than where they are possessed, the base or MAJCOM directs how hours will be
       forwarded to the MIS reporting location. The base or MAJCOM may use interim
       reporting means such as phone, fax, or message via email. Avoid duplicate reporting
       when the aircraft returns to its possessed location and process the original AFTO Form
       781.
          2.29.2.1.1. The utilization monitor in the MAJCOM will provide instructions on how
          to get the hours to the possessed location.
       2.29.2.2. When an AFMC contractor or depot field team possesses an aircraft and an
       AFMC aircrew will fly the FCF, the reporting base submits utilization data using:
          2.29.2.2.1. A "DR" possession purpose identifier.
          2.29.2.2.2. PEC 0702007F.
          2.29.2.2.3. Program Element Identification (PEID) "I" (INDIA).
          2.29.2.2.4. Command code ―MTC‖ for the field team.
          2.29.2.2.5. Field Team organization.
   2.29.3. In aircraft movements such as rotations and deployments, the MAJCOM AVDO
   should consider ease of reporting and flying hour accountability in deciding whether to
   transfer possession to the operating location.
AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010                                                            33


       2.29.3.1. If the movement involves more than one MAJCOM, MAJCOM AVDOs must
       agree on the inventory reporting changes to make sure utilization is reported to the
       desired MAJCOM. MAJCOM AVDOs issue inventory reporting instructions before
       aircraft movement unless the movement is urgent.
          2.29.3.1.1. The MAJCOM utilization monitor will make this determination and
          coordinate with MAJCOM-AVDO.
2.30. What to Report. Utilization reporting is required for all aircraft except those in
possession purpose codes XU, XY, and NY.
2.31. Multiple Utilization Reporting. This capability is only currently available in the REMIS
and G081 MIS.
   2.31.1. Multiple utilization reporting allows sorties to be divided in segments or legs. A leg
   is a portion of a sortie that may have a different mission number or PEC / Utilization Purpose
   Code (UPC) / Type Utilization Code combination.
   2.31.2. Time overlaps or gaps between sortie legs are not allowed and all flying time will be
   entered in Zulu time.
   2.31.3. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) code may be used to designate
   from/to locations on each sortie leg. ICAO codes will be edited against the ICAO Code
   table.
   2.31.4. (Added-AETC) Submit utilization data to HQ AFMC for aircraft requiring FCF as
   a result of undergoing modification by AFMC rapid area maintenance and or contract field
   team. Use mission symbol O80I (letter O, eight, zero, letter I) and PEC 72007F. NOTE: It
   may be necessary to place a zero before and after the first seven.

Section 2F—Accountability, Termination, and Delivery Procedures

2.32. Aircraft Accountability.
   2.32.1. HQ AFMC/A4U-AVDO maintains accountability on AFMC Form 1026, Aircraft
   Accountability Record, for all Air Force aircraft. The AF AVDO assigns voucher numbers
   for terminated vehicles and records them on AF Form 3131, General Purpose (used as a
   manual register of all assigned voucher numbers).
   2.32.2. Accountability begins when DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving
   Report, is signed.
   2.32.3. Account for aircraft as long as they are assigned to an Air Force, Air National Guard,
   or US Air Force Reserve activity. Accountability ends on receipt of a termination message
   and/or DD Form 1149, AFTO Form 290, Aerospace Vehicle Delivery Receipt, or DD Form
   250 with termination transactions input to the appropriate MIS.
   2.32.4. AF AVDO must maintain an electronic continuity book.
2.33. Final Termination Accountability.
   2.33.1. The possessing unit AVDO initiates termination of accountability with a termination
   message and inputs the termination into the appropriate MIS if:
 34                                               AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010


       2.33.1.1. Loss or disposition is due to crash damage or major maintenance beyond
       economical repair.
       2.33.1.2. The possessing organization receives certification of destruction, normally via
       contractor or DRMS.
       2.33.1.3. Upon transfer to DRMS, USAF Heritage Program, Other DoD Service, DoD
       agency, other government agency (local, state, or federal), executed foreign military sale.
       Transfer can be executed by, but is not limited to the following documents: DD1149,
       DD1348-1 or GSA Form 120/121.
   2.33.2. For crash-damaged aircraft: The possessing unit AVDO initiates and sends a
   termination message without waiting for mishap investigation board findings after the
   Maintenance Group Commander, or equivalent, with System Program Director coordination
   determines the aircraft is completely beyond repair. If the decision is beyond the Group
   Commander's capability, submit an AFTO Form 92, IAW TO 1-1-638, Repair and Disposal
   of Aerospace Vehicles, to the System Program Director for engineering determination. The
   unit AVDO terminates possession upon receipt of determination via message. The
   possessing unit AVDO terminates possession, citing the Group Commander's decision with
   SPD coordination or the SPD's engineering determination message and reports using
   Aerospace Equipment Termination Report, along with MIS input. Note: Prior to
   terminating an aerospace vehicle from the MIS, archive all records.
       2.33.2.1. Report abandoned aircraft wreckage to the nearest Defense Property Disposal
       Office for sale or formal abandonment.
       2.33.2.2. Crashed aircraft considered for termination will be placed in possession code
       XW until the Maintenance Group Commander, equivalent, or SPM determines the
       appropriate termination code.
       2.33.2.3. Units determine the appropriate termination code using the Air Force Data
       Dictionary.
   2.33.3. The unit AVDO sends a copy of the termination message to the unit engine manager
   with responsibility for the engines. This message gives the engine manager the authority to
   dispose of the engines according to AFI 21-104.
       2.33.3.1. After the engine manager has disposed of or terminated the engines, the unit
       AVDO terminates the aircraft using the applicable termination code as described in the
       Air Force Data Dictionary.
   2.33.4. Sometimes, HQ USAF authorizes the termination of aircraft that cannot be
   terminated using standard procedures. In such cases, the possessing unit processes the
   termination citing the HQ USAF notification as authority.
   2.33.5. Disposition of aircraft historical records. After release of aircraft historical records
   by the accident investigating board and/or termination from the Air Force Inventory, retain
   the records for three months, then destroy IAW the AF Records Disposition Schedule in
   AFRIMS, https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims , Table 21-6, Rule 3.
2.34. Delivering Aircraft to Agencies Outside the Air Force.

Activities

2.35. Using AFTO Form 290.
   2.35.1. Use AFTO Form 290 as a record of selected equipment to be transferred with the
   aircraft. The form:
       2.35.1.1. Is not required if aircraft are moved by airlift or surface transportation.
       2.35.1.2. Is used in lieu of the DD Form 1149, for aircraft going to agencies outside the
       Air Force inventory.
       2.35.1.3. Gives the delivery pilot, transporter, or recipient organizations a complete list
       of items they must check.
   2.35.2. Use AFTO Form 290 as:
       2.35.2.1. An aircraft receipt for delivery pilots or transporters.
       2.35.2.2. A receipt for selected aircraft equipment and as a paperwork checklist.
   2.35.3. The releasing organization (such as the AVDO or AFPRO at factories, depots,
   modification centers, and bases), or the delivery control officer at the base where the delivery
   started, fills out the form, including:
       2.35.3.1. The aircraft or missile model and serial number.
       2.35.3.2. Account or contract number.
       2.35.3.3. Project and priority.
       2.35.3.4. Flight Transportation Order Number when known.
       2.35.3.5. Receiving organization (organization to which the aircraft will be delivered).
       2.35.3.6. Released by (the releasing organization's unit, base, and command).
       2.35.3.7. Delivery Point (point and date of release).
36                                               AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010


     2.35.3.8. Numbers Placed on Aircraft or Missile by Releasing Organization, column B
     (the numbers of listed items placed on each aircraft). Note: List all Confidential, Secret,
     and/or Nuclear Weapon Related Materiel (NWRM) equipment installed on the aircraft in
     the space provided. Enter "none" in the "classified materiel installed on aircraft" block of
     the AFTO Form 290 if the aircraft has no classified materiel/NWRM installed.
     2.35.3.9. The authorized representative at the delivering organization accepts the aircraft
     from delivery and accepts responsibility for paperwork and equipment listed in column B
     of the check-list by signing the delivery receipt in the space provided. The representative
     checks each item received in column C. When the check is complete, the representative
     initials the bottom of the column.
     2.35.3.10. The delivery organization must not accept the aircraft until the items listed in
     column B match those on the aircraft.
     2.35.3.11. If the authorized representative of the delivering organization is the pilot or
     transporter, fill out the AFTO Form 290 just before the aircraft actually departs.
     2.35.3.12. Delivery control or transportation officers at factories or modification centers
     must check the items listed and sign AFTO Form 290.
  2.35.4. At factories or modification centers, the delivery control or transportation officer
  may not have guards to keep close watch over received aircraft. Instead, a contractor, or
  other agency provides these services.
     2.35.4.1. In these cases, the delivery control transportation office is not responsible for
     items listed on AFTO Form 290.
     2.35.4.2. The delivery pilot or transporter of the delivery control or transportation officer
     must personally check all items and promptly sign a receipt for them on AFTO Form 290
     in the "Transportation/Ferrying Organization Receipt" section before the aircraft departs.
  2.35.5. AFTO Form 290 provides space in columns D through I for up to three intermediate
  stops. Use this space when the pilot or transporter is not staying with the aircraft and does
  not want to be responsible for the items on the checklist.
     2.35.5.1. If the aircraft makes more than three intermediate stops, the pilot or transporter
     uses an additional set of forms and attaches them to the first form.
     2.35.5.2. At these intermediate activities, the commander authorized representative take
     responsibility for the items after check-in.
     2.35.5.3. The authorized activity representative and the pilot or transporter check the
     items immediately after the aircraft arrives.
     2.35.5.4. If all items in column B match those on the aircraft, the activity representative
     checks the first open intermediate activity check-in column and initials the bottom of the
     column.
     2.35.5.5. If an item is missing, the representative enters the correct figure in the check-in
     column. The pilot or transporter initials the corrected figure and explains the discrepancy
     in the remarks section of the form. After all items are checked, the activity commander is
     responsible for the equipment and papers.
AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010                                                              37


       2.35.5.6. The pilot or transporter checks the items in the checklist before the aircraft
       leaves. The pilot or transporter checks the proper intermediate activity check-out column
       and initials the bottom of the check-out column. The activity representative also initials
       the column. The activity representative must explain any discrepancy in the remarks
       section of the form, giving his or her grade and signature.
   2.35.6. When the aircraft arrives, if the items in column B match those on the aircraft, the
   authorized representative of the recipient organization checks column J and initials the
   bottom of the column.
       2.35.6.1. If an item is missing, the representative enters the corrected figure in column J
       and the pilot or transporter initials the corrected figure and explains in the remarks
       section of the form.
       2.35.6.2. The authorized representative of the recipient organization then signs the
       receipt in the space provided on the form.

       2.35.7.1. Copy 1 -- home station.
       2.35.7.2. Copy 2 -- pilot or transporter.
       2.35.7.3. Copy 3 -- recipient.
       2.35.7.4. Copy 4 -- releasing organization.
       2.35.7.5. Copy 5 -- Defense Plant Representative Office (DPRO) where the contractor
       facility is located, marked for the property administrator (if aircraft are delivered to the
       contractor facility).
   2.35.8. The commands should work together to reduce the number of copies needed.

Section 2G—Reporting Assigned and Possessed Drones and Unmanned Aerospace Systems
(UAS)

2.36. Possession Reporting. The reporting requirements in this section are exempt from
licensing in accordance with paragraph 2.11.5. of AFI 33-324. Drone and UAS reporting begins
when a drone or UAS is accepted according to this section and after AF/ A8PL starts assignment
action by sending AF Form 913, Aerospace Vehicle Project Action, and an Air Force Project
Number to the Air Force AVDO at HQ AFMC/A4U-AVDO (See AFI 16-402). The Air Force
AVDO sends the information to the MAJCOM AVDO. Either HQ USAF or the MAJCOM
gives assignment changes to the Air Force AVDO (according to program documents) as they
happen. HQ AFMC sends MAJCOM assignment changes to HQ USAF. Note: Status and
utilization will be waived for drones.
   2.36.1. The unit gains possession of a drone or UAS when:
       2.36.1.1. They move in a "PJ" purpose identifier. The possession changes at the time the
       TMF of the gaining organization accepts the drone or UAS.
       2.36.1.2. An authorized government representative accepts the drone or UAS from a
       contractor on behalf of the Air Force. HQ AFMC becomes the first possessing activity
 38                                              AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010


      for a new production drone or UAS at the time it is accepted. The gain is processed by
      AFMC/A4U-AVDO.
   2.36.2. An organization loses possession of a drone or UAS when AFMC/A4U-AVDO
   computer generates the loss of a new production drone or UAS for HQ AFMC. After the
   organization processes the loss transaction, the REMIS inventory database is updated
   automatically.
   2.36.3. Termination of possession starts at the time of transfer to the non-Air Force activity
   on the date that the drone or UAS meets termination requirements.
      2.36.3.1. A drone or UAS is terminated and no longer needs to be reported if the drone
      or UAS is lost from the Air Force inventory or has been assigned (permanent transfer) to
      non-Air Force activities such as:
          2.36.3.1.1. Foreign countries.
          2.36.3.1.2. Other DoD and government agencies.
2.37. Notification Procedures.
   2.37.1. Notification procedures are the same for drones and UAS as previously outlined for
   aircraft in paragraphs 2.15. through 2.21.

Section 2H—Financial Accountability

2.38. Asset Value
   2.38.1. Weapon System Program Managers are responsible for establishing the complete
   acquisition value in REMIS for each delivered AF aircraft, UAS, cruise missiles, and drone.
      2.38.1.1. The value must include all installed subcomponents purchased on a separate
      contract and all GFM.
      2.38.1.2. The value should be established in REMIS not more than 5 work days after the
      AF-AVDO establishes the asset record in REMIS.
      2.38.1.3. Since the full-scale drone costs are determined in phases, the Weapon System
      Program Manager will enter the initial cost (fly away cost from AMARG) and then
      update the cost as the other costs are reported to that office. AMARG and any other
      organic or commercial organization involved in creating the drones must provide this
      information to the Weapon System Program Manager in a timely manner.
      2.38.1.4. A copy of the documentation supporting the acquisition value should be
      maintained in the Weapon System Program Manager for the life of the weapon system
      plus 5 years. This documentation can be stored electronically but the program office
      must ensure that there are copies of this information stored at a backup site (other than
      the location of the Weapon System Program Managers).
2.39. Modification Value
   2.39.1. Weapon System Program Managers are responsible for establishing CFO
   modification records including determining the value of the modification on each asset and
   documenting when the modification was completed on each asset.
AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010                                                         39


     2.39.1.1. This CFO requirement applies to aircraft and UAS. The full-scale and sub-
     scale drones do not have to record modifications for CFO reporting.
     2.39.1.2. Capitalize only those modifications that add capability to the weapon system or
     extend the useful life of the weapon system beyond its originally planned useful life.
     2.39.1.3. Establish the applicable modification records with the modification cost once
     the contract is awarded or when the contract price is known and add the completion date
     once the modification is completed on each asset.
     2.39.1.4. The modification records should be established in REMIS not more than 5
     work days after the qualified modification contract was awarded or when the contract
     price is known. In addition, the modification completion date should be entered in
     REMIS not more than 5 work days after the modification was completed on the specific
     asset.
     2.39.1.5. A copy of the documentation supporting the modification information should
     be maintained in the Weapon System Program Manager for the life of the weapon system
     plus 5 years. This documentation can be stored electronically but the program office
     must ensure that there are copies of this information stored at a backup site (other than
     the location of the Weapon System Program Managers). Note: Each Weapon System
     Program Manager will identify a primary and alternate CFO focal point. Each CFO focal
     point is responsible for entering the complete acquisition cost of each asset (including
     GFM) delivered to the Air Force (For full-scale drones this includes the cost of making
     the drone flyable as well as the cost of installing the drone package), determining which
     modifications need to be capitalized, enter complete modification information, review
     CFO information, submit any corrections, and attest to the information in REMIS as
     required.

                                         Chapter 3

                INVENTORY AND STATUS REPORTING OF MISSILES

Section 3A—Reporting Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs)

3.1. Types of Reporting.
   3.1.1. Inventory and Status Reporting. ICBM reporting includes inventory and status
   reporting on assembled ICBM downstages and Propulsion System Rocket Engines (PSRE)
   assigned to units by HQ USAF and MAJCOMs for specific missions. The AVDO records
   this information and sends it to the MAJCOM. For ICBM downstages, either HQ USAF or
   the MAJCOMs provide changes to assignment data to the Air Force AVDO (according to
   program documents) as they occur. HQ AFMC/A4LC-AVDO sends HQ USAF assignment
   changes to the MAJCOM. Reporting begins when:
       3.1.1.1. The missile downstage and PSRE are accepted according to this section.
       3.1.1.2. AF/A8PL initiates the first assignment action by sending mission design series
       (MDS), command of assignment, missile downstage, PSRE and purpose identifier,
       program element code (PEC), and assignment project to the Air Force AVDO (See AFI
       16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming, Assignment, Distribution, Accounting and
       Termination.)
   3.1.2. Possession Reporting. Possession is the actual acceptance or designation of
   responsibility for a missile downstage and PSRE. When the unit takes possession of an
   ICBM, the unit starts reporting according to this instruction and applicable systems
   instructions.
       3.1.2.1. Units input all missile downstage and PSRE gains, losses and relocations into
       Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS). For ICBM booster, perform semi-annual
       reconciliation of MIS with MAJCOM provided REMIS documents.
       3.1.2.2. The unit processing the ICBM will report the gain as required (Delete entire
       ―EXCEPTION‖ paragraph).
       3.1.2.3. Units will report ICBM All Up Rounds (AUR). An ICBM is classified as an All
       Up Round when in the launch facility and possessed in Possession Purpose Code ―CC‖.
       3.1.2.4. The Maintenance Group Commander (Squadron Commander for 30 SW units
       due to unique organizational makeup) and/or depot maintenance directorate appoints a
       primary and alternate AVDO to report inventory status for the unit or depot. By
       facsimile or message, provide the MAJCOM AVDO the name, grade, duty phone, e-mail
       address, and office symbol of the primary and alternate AVDO annually at the beginning
       of each fiscal year and as changes in personnel occur.
3.2. Possession Gain, Loss, and Relocation Criteria:
   3.2.1. An organization gains possession of a missile downstage or PSRE when the gaining
   organization accepts the asset.
AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010                                                             41


   3.2.2. An organization loses possession of the missile downstage or PSRE when the gaining
   organization accepts possession of the asset. Also, an organization loses possession of a
   missile downstage or PSRE when the ICBM is launched or destroyed.
   3.2.3. For missile downstage or PSRE moved in PJ code, possession changes when the
   Traffic Management Office (TMO) of the gaining field unit accepts the vehicle or when the
   581 MMXS/MXDPB (Missile Maintenance Support Flight) accepts it at the depot (OO-
   ALC).
       3.2.3.1. This is accomplished when TMO of the gaining organization or 581
       MMXS/MXDPB accepts the vehicle at the gaining station location code. The crews that
       move missiles by truck are treated as ―neutral‖ crews and therefore do not affect gain/loss
       reporting.
   3.2.4. Depot relocates a missile downstage or PSRE when they move it between buildings or
   to contracted organizations supporting depot functions/programs. An organization relocates
   a missile downstage or PSRE when they move it from support base or another launch facility
   (LF) and it is installed at a new LF and an organization relocates a missile downstage or
   PSRE when they return the asset from a LF to the support base.
3.3. Notification Procedures. Use the same reporting procedures for ICBM possession changes
as those spelled out for aircraft outlined in paragraphs 2.15. -2.21. You may include more than
one transaction in the same notification message.
EXCEPTIONS:
   3.3.1. Relocation Message, Aerospace Equipment Location Change Report). The AVDO of
   the organization relocating a missile downstage or PSRE must send a priority relocation
   message to the depot AVDO not later than the first workday after the asset‘s location
   changed. See Attachment 18 for a sample relocation message and instructions for preparing
   it. This report is designated emergency status code (ESC) C-1. Continue reporting during
   emergency conditions, priority precedence. Submit data requirements assigned this category
   as prescribed or by any means to ensure arrival on published due dates. A relocation
   message does not require USAF AVDO or MAJCOM AVDO notification. ICBM booster
   relocation may require a possession purpose identifier code change message IAW
   Attachment 13.
   3.3.2. No airframe hours are required.
3.4. ICBM Accountability.
   3.4.1. HQ AFMC/A4U-AVDO maintains accountability for ICBMs on the AFMC Form
   1026. The AVDO assigns voucher numbers for terminated ICBMs and records them on AF
   Form 3131, Aero-space Vehicle Voucher Register.
   3.4.2. For all missile downstages or PSREs assigned to an Air Force activity, accountability
   begins when the DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, is signed.
   3.4.3. Accountability ends on receipt of a termination message and DD Form 1348-1, when
   applicable.
   3.4.4. The Unit AVDO is responsible for completing all reportable IMDS/REMIS
   transactions.
 42                                               AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010


3.5. ICBM Condition Status Reporting.
   3.5.1. Report ICBM condition status through, ICBM Condition Status Report. Transmit this
   report on the tenth working day of each month. This report is designated emergency status
   code (ESC) C-1. Continue reporting during emergency conditions, priority precedence.
   Submit data requirements assigned this category as prescribed or by any means to ensure
   arrival on published due dates. Use IMDS to record the cause and duration of every ICBM
   status condition. The missile launch facility designator is the governing identifier for this
   system.
   3.5.2. Report the condition status on the entire ICBM site, including:
       3.5.2.1. The missile downstage or PSRE.
       3.5.2.2. Real property installed equipment (RPIE).
       3.5.2.3. Support equipment (SE).
       3.5.2.4. Any other equipment needed for launch.
3.6. NMCM and NMCS Time.
   3.6.1. NMCM time starts when you realize that an NMC condition exists. The time stops
   when either maintenance finishes the repair and the missile achieves strategic alert, or when
   you find a verified NMCS condition. NMCM time resumes when the required supply items
   arrive.
   3.6.2. NMCS time starts when all of these conditions exist:
       3.6.2.1. When a parts requirement affects Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP)
       capability or launch capability.
       3.6.2.2. Maintenance makes a valid demand on supply.
       3.6.2.3. Maintenance verifies the impact of the needed part.
       3.6.2.4. Maintenance and supply together verify that the needed part (serviceable or
       reparable and not awaiting parts) is not available on base.
       3.6.2.5. Maintenance stops work on a system, subsystem, or component because the base
       lacks a needed part.
   3.6.3. The NMCS time stops when maintenance receives the supply item or items.
       3.6.3.1. If maintenance cannot take delivery of the item when it becomes available, the
       NMCS time stops at the time supply received the part.

Section 3B—Air Launched Cruise Missiles

3.7. Air Launched Cruise Missiles Reporting: Report all Air Launched Cruise Missile,
Advanced Cruise Missile, and Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile inventory gains, losses
and terminations (using the same procedures for aircraft outlined in paragraphs 2.13. thru 2.21.
of this instruction. Perform a semi-annual reconciliation of all assigned/possessed cruise missile
inventories with IMDS and REMIS.
AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010                                                           43


Section 3C— Financial Accountability

3.8. Asset Value
   3.8.1. Weapon System Program Managers are responsible for establishing the complete
   acquisition value in REMIS for each delivered AF aircraft, UAS, cruise missiles, and drone.
      3.8.1.1. The value must include all installed subcomponents purchased on a separate
      contract and all GFM.
      3.8.1.2. The value should be established in REMIS not more than 5 work days after the
      AF-AVDO establishes the asset record in REMIS.
      3.8.1.3. A copy of the documentation supporting the acquisition value should be
      maintained in the Weapon System Program Manager for the life of the weapon system
      plus 5 years. This documentation can be stored electronically but the program office
      must ensure that there are copies of this information stored at a backup site (other than
      the location of the Weapon System Program Managers).
3.9. Modification Value
   3.9.1. Weapon System Program Managers are responsible for establishing CFO modification
   records including determining the value of the modification on each asset and documenting
   when the modification was completed on each asset.
      3.9.1.1. This CFO requirement applies to ICBMs. The cruise missiles do not have to
      record modifications for CFO reporting.
      3.9.1.2. Capitalize only those modifications that meet the DoD capitalization threshold
      and add capability to the weapon system or extend the useful life of the weapon system
      beyond its originally planned useful life.
      3.9.1.3. Establish the applicable modification records with the modification cost once the
      contract is awarded or when the contract price is known and add the completion date
      once the modification is completed on each asset.
      3.9.1.4. The modification records should be established in REMIS not more than 5 work
      days after the qualified modification contract was awarded or when the contract price is
      known. In addition, the modification completion date should be entered in REMIS not
      more than 5 work days after the modification was completed on the specific asset.
      3.9.1.5. A copy of the documentation supporting the modification information should be
      maintained in the Weapon System Program Manager for the life of the weapon system

   4.5.1. Units report the inventory of all groups of trainers even if they are under CLS, TCT,
   or ATS.
   4.5.2. The basic possession purpose code for all trainers is TJ. Change the possession
   purpose code of a trainer in pipeline, storage, or modification, according to Air Force Data
   Dictionary, ADE AE-630 Aerospace Vehicle and Trainer Purpose Identifier. Use these
   codes to show the status of the trainer. For example, use BT code if a trainer is:
       4.5.2.1. Being made ready for transfer.
       4.5.2.2. In transit.
       4.5.2.3. Being assembled for operation.

    COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT STATUS AND INVENTORY REPORTING

6.1. Purpose.
   6.1.1. The reporting requirements in this section are exempt from licensing in accordance
   with paragraph 2.11.3 of AFI 33-324. Base activities enter transactions via IMDS and
   transmit them to REMIS on a near real-time basis.
   6.1.2. REMIS provides managers with worldwide information and the capability to extract
   data on in-use Air Force systems. This MIS:
      6.1.2.1. Helps managers identify trends and clear up problems.
      6.1.2.2. Helps in developing replacement systems, spare parts, and equipment
      modifications.
      6.1.2.3. Ensures that managers know the equipment status on critical communications
      equipment.
   6.1.3. For the purpose of this instruction communications equipment as it relates to AFSPC
   includes Space Command and Control (C2) systems.
6.2. Terms/Status Definitions.
   6.2.1. Green - Fully Mission Capable (FMC): Equipment/system functioning as required
   in TO specifications and is capable of doing all assigned missions.
   6.2.2. Amber - Partial Mission Capable (PMC): System or equipment functioning in such
   a way that it can perform at least one, but not all its missions/functions impaired but usable.
   Systems with redundant capabilities will be coded PMC when redundancy is lost, even
   though the system is fully capable of supporting all missions. Equipment must be at least
   amber when you order partially mission capable supply.
      6.2.2.1. Equipment in this category usually supports minimum mission requirements
      with deficiencies in range, quality, and speed of service. Further loss of redundancy,
      spare equipment, channels, circuits, frequencies, etc. will cause the equipment to become
      RED (NMC). Equipment reported as AMBER for the sole purpose of ordering parts at a
      higher priority is not authorized.
   6.2.3. Red - Not Mission Capable (NMC): The system or equipment does not meet the TO
   specifications; therefore, cannot accomplish its assigned mission or function. Unusable
   (neither in use nor available for use). The equipment must be red when you order parts not
   mission capable supply.
      6.2.3.1. Condition does not apply if the equipment is in use, available for use, or was
      turned off by the user at their option. Equipment Notice to Airmen (NOTAMed) out is
      considered RED (NMC) until it is NOTAMed back in.
   6.2.4. Mission status: Status hours required for operation of mission-set equipment. Note
   Mission status reporting is optional within IMDS; however MAJCOMs/FOAs can define
   mission status reporting procedures in MAJCOM/FOA supplements, if required.
 50                                              AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010


   6.2.5. Status Codes: Are used in REMIS to determine the condition status of the equipment
   at the point in time the status is being reported and have the same meaning as downtime code
   in IMDS. See Table 6.2 for list of status codes.
   6.2.6. Reason Codes: Are used in REMIS to help explain when equipment is placed in the
   ―Other (NMCO) status code condition and have the same meaning as delay codes in IMDS.
   See Table 6.3 for list of reason codes.
   6.2.7. Downtime Codes: The codes provide the cause for C-E equipment downtime and are
   used in reporting status. See Attachment 5 for list of downtime codes.
   6.2.8. Delay Codes: The codes listed reasons for C-E equipment delay time and are used in
   reporting status.
   6.2.9. Active Equipment: Equipment installed and commissioned to perform an
   operational mission or requirement includes cold spares or off-line equipment and
   equipment used for in-house training or PMIs).
   6.2.10. Inactive Equipment: Equipment not commissioned or installed to perform an
   operational mission or requirement. Includes equipment in storage, tactical and combat
   communications equipment not deployed or setup and operational for training, mockups,
   procured/identified training equipment, and equipment not being utilized to perform a
   specific mission.
6.3. Security Exemption.
   6.3.1. Do not report or enter classified data into IMDS. Report equipment or mission status
   information as directed by the maintaining command or as specified in the commands
   security classification guide.

       reconciliation of all RED/AMBER jobs.
       6.4.5.13. Ensure updates provided by the work center are entered into the ESR system
       through IMDS.
       6.4.5.14. Be familiar with using TRIC "STI" (IMDS 230 NFSB80, Status Inquiry) so the
       job status of new or existing jobs may be reviewed during the duty day for accuracy.
       6.4.5.15. Perform checks and balances to ensure ESR is current and accurate.
   6.4.6. The work center will:
       6.4.6.1. Appoint a work center ESR point of contact (POC) if the workcenter has ESR
       reportable equipment. It can be the work center supervisor or any individual within the
       section. The ESR POC will review and provide updates/corrections to the CFP weekly.
       6.4.6.2. Review the OIL to ensure each job against the work center is current and correct.
       6.4.6.3. Contact the CFP when problems are discovered and provide updates on a timely
       basis so the job can be updated.
       6.4.6.4. Be familiar with using TRIC "STI" (Status Inquiry) so the job status of new or
       existing jobs may be reviewed during the duty day.
       6.4.6.5. Account for or remove all reportable equipment end items from Air Force
       Equipment Management System (AFEMS) or Asset Inventory Management (AIM)
       records before requesting the CFP to add the reportable equipment to the EIL.
6.5. What is Reportable? Report all communications equipment (Type Equipment ‗C‘ or ‗R‘)
that is assigned a standard reporting designator (SRD), as listed in the IMDS/REMIS SRD Table.
This requirement exists even when bases are undergoing closure, systems will be reported until
deactivated or the base is closed. Use Transaction Identification Code (TRIC) QBC, Program
NFSU10, Screen 127 or TRIC QCC, Program NFS840, Screen126 to view the SRD table.
   6.5.1. Report equipment inventory in IMDS for all equipment (including in-garrison
   deployable equipment) assigned a SRD to include items that do not require maintenance data
   collection (MDC) as indicated on the REMIS SRD table (IMDS reporting level P or Y).
       6.5.1.1. Report inventory only for COMSEC equipment (SRD category U and IMDS
       report level P).
   6.5.2. Report equipment status for all equipment (including in-garrison deployable
   equipment) that is authorized MICAP as indicated on the REMIS SRD table (IMDS
   reporting level Y). Note: Do not report status against embedded equipment (items installed
AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010                                                           53


   on a higher level end item) (e.g. GRC-171 can be used as a standalone item in a Ground to
   Air Transmitter-Receiver (GATR site) or as an embedded part of the TYQ-23. Since the
   GRC-171 has an SRD both will be loaded to the inventory, however when the one imbedded
   in the TYQ-23 breaks, the status is documented against the TYQ-23 using the WUC of the
   imbedded item.
      6.5.2.1. Report classified equipment status on Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and
      Reconnaissance Agency (AFISRA) equipment (SRD category Q) as directed by
      AFISRA. SRD category Q will only be used by AFISRA units. MAJCOMS are not
      authorized to use SRD category Q unless permitted by AFISRA.
   6.5.3. You may report local status only on non-reportable equipment, provided the reporting
   level is set to local only (IMDS reporting level R). Status reported on equipment or with
   IMDS report level R will remain at the local (base level IMDS) database.
   6.5.4. MAJCOMs/FOAs, or higher headquarters determine what mission reporting is
   required (IMDS reporting level Y). MAJCOM/FOA supplements define specific reporting
   and non-reporting requirements.
   6.5.5. Contractor          Reporting. For        contractor-controlled     or     maintained
   equipment/system(s), the possessing organizations still retains the responsibility to ensure
   inventory, status, utilization, and configuration reporting is accomplished. The organization
   owning the contract maintenance requirement or designated official shall be responsible for
   ensuring the contract contains the necessary requirements for the contractor to provide the
   required inventory and status reporting information to affected users. The organization
   requiring the contract controlled maintenance shall work with the contracting officer to
   ensure inventory and equipment status reporting requirements are accurately captured in
   contract documents. For example the contracting quality assurance evaluator (QAE) may
   have to enter the inventory and equipment status reporting in IMDS.
   6.5.6. Weather Meteorological Equipment. See Attachment 15 and Attachment 16 for
   specific guidance on status and serial number reporting of Weather Meteorological
   equipment.
   6.5.7. Deployable Communications Equipment Status Reporting.
      6.5.7.1. Deployable communications equipment poses a challenge for reporting
      purposes. Unlike its fixed base counterpart, much of the equipment is in storage (in-
      garrison). Even when it is being utilized, it is seldom used in close proximity to an
      established base. The following procedures apply:
      6.5.7.2. Reporting Criteria: Report equipment status as per para 6.3 when the equipment
      is deployed. Local deployed reporting procedures will be developed no later than 14 days
      after deployment to ensure data is recorded on a reoccurring basis.
      6.5.7.3. Requirement for real time outage reporting (when the equipment is deployed and
      operational) will be determined by appropriate reporting agency.
6.6. Equipment Status Reporting Procedures.
   6.6.1. Follow the instructions for TRIC COX, Screen 996, Program NFSJR0 and TRIC
   EUC, Screen 997, Program NFSJQ0, in AFCSM 21-560, volume 2.
54                                              AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010


     6.6.1.1. TRIC COX (Communications Status Load and Maintenance Scheduling) will
     not process action/request if the start date is greater than 33 days in the past from the
     current date.
     6.6.1.2. TRIC EUC (Status Update and Close) will not delete, or update a status or delay
     in which the start date/time is greater than 33 days in the past from the current date.
  6.6.2. Unless specified in a MAJCOM supplement, you do not need to report:
     6.6.2.1. Outage of less than 5 minutes.
     6.6.2.2. Frequency changes, crypto reset, or runway change outages that last less than 15
     minutes.
     6.6.2.3. Adjustments or alignments performed during scheduled maintenance such as
     PMIs, TCTO and TCI. These actions are documented during the outage.
     6.6.2.4. Generator run-ups that are scheduled. However, RED time associated with
     generator failures during scheduled run-ups if over 5 minutes will be reported using
     Down Time Code (DTC) "N".
  6.6.3. Use the downtime codes listed in Attachment 5 to describe the reason for the outage.
  6.6.4. Use the delay codes listed in Attachment 6 to describe any maintenance delay that is
  keeping the equipment from being returned to operational status.
  6.6.5. Use ESR sequence codes to upgrade or downgrade status. Do not change the
  condition code on the original status unless it was wrong when loaded. Change sequence
  codes as needed to allow more than 26 delays or comments.
  6.6.6. Work Unit Codes (WUC). WUCs are an important part of ESR reporting. They
  determine subsystem problems and repair actions associated with a piece of equipment or a
  system. A proper WUC is required to be entered into ESR when an equipment problem is
  discovered or repaired (except for DTC of "U"). It is the technician‘s responsibility to
  provide CFP with the proper WUC when the equipment is returned to service, when parts are
  placed on order or when the source of the outage is known. Use the lowest assembly WUC
  when possible and do not use the highest assembly (i.e. AB000) WUC. The lowest level
  WUC is used to identify specific components causing equipment downtime. Note: The use
  of **000 must not be used when a more specific WUC is available.
     6.6.6.1. Always report status against the highest level end item when reporting a red or
     amber status condition against an embedded end item. Do so by using the WUC within
     the highest level end item's WUC table that best describes the lower level embedded end
     item and is the closest to the component in need of repair. Never downgrade the status of
     work unit coded associated equipment if maintenance is not required for higher or lower
     assemblies.
     6.6.6.2. Refer to MAJCOM supplement of mission reporting requirements for associated
     equipment status reporting.
  6.6.7. Reporting Procedures. CFP will report changes in equipment status as they become
  aware of them. This is accomplished by user notification or from the work center. The
  following procedures apply:
AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010                                                             55


     6.6.7.1. Status Times. Use the notification time the outage was reported. Do not
     backdate times to previous days. Not Applicable (N/A) to AFSPC when status of outages
     are considered classified. Time logged to put equipment back into service will be used to
     close the job.
     6.6.7.2. Downtime Codes. Initial down-time code (DTC) of "U-Unknown" will be
     entered until such time as maintenance can determine the exact problem, then change the
     DTC to the one best describing the reason for the outage. DTC definitions are found in
     Attachment 5 of this instruction and AFCSM 21-560 Vol 2, Attachment 1.
     6.6.7.3. Delay Codes. Use Delay Codes (DC) when maintenance is not working on the
     problem. Use the code which best describes the delay. Close the delays upon return of
     maintenance on the job, reason for the delay no longer exists, or a change in situation
     occurs. Researching parts is not a delay unless it exceeds 30 minutes. DC definitions are
     found in Attachment 6 of this instruction and AFCSM 21-560 Vol 2, Attachment 1.
     6.6.7.4. Comment requirements:
        6.6.7.4.1. Enter comments against the status and delay codes as required. Do not add
        comments to codes not requiring them unless an adverse circumstance warrants it.
        Keep comments short and concise but ensure there is enough information to describe
        the problem or situation.
        6.6.7.4.2. Enter comments against the status and delay codes that require one. Do
        not add comments to codes not requiring them unless an adverse circumstance
        warrants it. Keep comments short and concise but ensure there is enough information
        to describe the problem or situation. Example: 125/TACAN INOP; AA -
        125/AWAITING DOWN-TIME.
     6.6.7.5. Comments against the STATUS:
        6.6.7.5.1. Initial status comments may not provide the exact reason for an outage.
        Use the words given by the user for the first comment. Example: 125/WSA MM3
        CONSTANT ALARM.
        6.6.7.5.2. Once maintenance has determined the problem cause, an actual reason for
        the outage must be entered. Example: 125/ALARMS CAUSED BY FAULTY
        WIRES.
        6.6.7.5.3. When the problem is corrected, enter the corrective action. Example:
        128/CE REPLACED EXTERIOR BUILDING WIRES.
        6.6.7.5.4. Other comments pertinent to the status of the equipment can be entered as
        they are known.
        6.6.7.5.5. Enter the Julian Date followed by a slash and then the comment. Example:
        A336/.
        6.6.7.5.6. Initials may be used if required. If initials are used, they will be placed one
        space after the comment. Using an entire line for initials must be avoided. No work
        center or agency names will be used. Units using initials must develop a local format
        for entering requirements. Example: 111/RADIO WEAK RX NM/OP.
 56                                                AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010


          6.6.7.5.7. Comments against delays will include an estimate of when maintenance
          will return to work on the problem. The Estimated Time Return to Operation
          (ETRO) will be entered at the end of the comment. If the ETRO expires, an update
          comment and ETRO will be entered. Example: 003/AWAITING DOWN-TIME
          ETRO 004D/1200 BB/DF.
          6.6.7.5.8. (Added) Abbreviations may be used if common to all levels of command.
          Example: 224/123.1 RX INOP.
          6.6.7.5.9. Comment lines must only contain pertinent information pertaining to the
          job. Do not enter extra characters (i.e., dots, dashes, etc.) to fill up the comment line.
6.7. Inventory Records. To load communication equipment to IMDS follow the instructions
for TRICs CEL, IMDS Screen 800, Program NFSE20 and MCR, Program NFSK60, in AFCSM
21-560, volume 2. IMDS TRIC Code "EIL" Equipment Inventory List (EIL) is use to extract
equipment inventory records.
   6.7.1. CEL is the source program for up channel and local reporting for communication
   equipment. This includes but is not limited to: Job Data Documentation (JDD), Equipment
   Status Reporting (ESR), Deficiency Reporting (DR), Time Compliance Technical Order
   (TCTO), and Enterprise Solutions Supply (ESS).
   6.7.2. Only communications equipment which possesses an AF level or local SRD being
   maintained by your unit or by a contractor overseen by the communication unit will be enter
   on the EIL.
      6.7.2.1. Not all equipment maintained by the unit is communications equipment. Items
      like vehicles, tool boxes, etc., will not be listed on the EIL. There are trainers, support
      equipment, and test, measurement, and diagnostic equipment (TMDE), which are loaded
      on other IMDS subsystems. These other subsystems have separate inventory lists which
      require different IMDS equipment loads.
      6.7.2.2. Contractor-supplied and maintained equipment can be reported or track using a
      local SRD.
      6.7.2.3. Gain equipment (enter it into the inventory) when your unit accepts maintenance
      responsibility and it has been accounted for in AFEMS and AIM.
      6.7.2.4. Lose equipment (place it in "inventory loss condition,") when your unit no
      longer has maintenance responsibility, "or when it has been decommissioned" and
      removed from AFEMS and AIM.
      6.7.2.5. When adding reportable equipment and missions to the inventory, make sure you
      have the right data elements and codes (obtained from SRD Table requested with IMDS
      screen 126). These data elements are important for status and inventory reporting.
      6.7.2.6. Change the equipment from active to inactive status as required. Combat
      Communications, tactical, and stored equipment will be reported as inactive until
      deployed, powered up, conducting PMIs, or maintenance, etc. (Operating time is
      calculated from active times as reported on possessed inventory.)

      6.7.2.7. Equipment Designator: Use the equipment designator as indicated on the
      IMDS/REMIS SRD Table (screen 126). The system will not accept equipment
      designators that differ from the IMDS/ REMIS SRD table.
      6.7.2.8. Serial Number: Use the actual equipment serial number from the equipment
      data plate. If the number is longer than fifteen characters, use the last fifteen. If the
      equipment has no serial number, assign one in accordance with AFMAN 23-110. If you
      find a duplicate serial number, verify your number and contact your MAJCOM/FOAs
      IMDS Functionals for assistance.
          6.7.2.8.1. Care must be taken to ensure that "0, O" and "1, I" are not confused when
          recording the serial number. If the equipment does not have a data plate or does not
          have a number in the serial number block, a message must be sent to MAJCOM for
          serial number assignment to prevent duplication of SNs in REMIS. A system made
          up of several components will use the SN of the control unit or main component.
      6.7.2.9. Requiring Command: Enter the MAJCOM that the equipment supports. This is
      the command that is the customer for the equipment. See AFCSM 21-556 volume 2,
      Introduction to the Core Automated Maintenance System, Attachment 1 or use IMDS
      screen 127, for a list of command codes.
      6.7.2.10. Overhaul/Install Date. When the equipment is initially loaded, use the date the
      equipment was accepted by the unit or equipment overhaul date. Do not change this date
      unless the original acceptance date was entered in error.

6.8. Organization Record.
    6.8.1. The IMDS system identifies an organization by number, kind, type, geographic
    location and detachment number. There are two organizational fields; IMDS and AFI 21-
    103.
       6.8.1.1. The 21-103 organization is used for up channel reporting to REMIS of status and
       inventory and follows the "G" Series Special Orders. Notify MAJCOM or FOA
       Functionals before making the change.
       6.8.1.2. The IMDS organization is used for local identification. In most cases the IMDS
       and 21-103 organizations should be the same.

   6.8.2. Assign a 4 digit organizational identification (ORG ID) only to actual units,
   detachments, and operating locations (OLs). Report equipment and missions (if required) at
   unmanned sites and locations under the organization that has maintenance responsibility.
   You need not lose and regain the inventory to change the organization record if within the
   same MAJCOM.
      6.8.2.1. The first two positions of the ORG ID are the 2 digit command code which is up
      channel reported to REMIS as a 3 digit command code.
      6.8.2.2. The last two positions of the ORG ID are "00" for the basic (parent) unit; for
      example, use "1C00".
      6.8.2.3. For detachments or OL, the last two positions of the ORG ID are the detachment
      number or operating location letter. For example: for Detachment 2, use "1C02"; for OL
      "A" use "1C0A."
      6.8.2.4. For an OL of a detachment, use the detachment and the OL letter; for example,
      "1C2A".
6.9. Organization Changes.
   6.9.1. Organization Record (OGT). The OGT is the IMDS record identifying the unit
   locally and when data is transmitted off base. The OGT record will not be updated unless
   specifically instructed to do so. Entering the wrong codes will prevent data from being
   passed to REMIS and other MISs. MAJCOM/ FOA or higher headquarters will provide
   specific instructions when a change to this record is required.
   6.9.2. The MAJCOMs/FOAs Functionals must make organization changes in REMIS prior
   to any AFI 21-103 organization change made in IMDS to avoid up channel reporting errors
   in IMDS. Notify your MAJCOM/FOA Functionals prior to loading or changing
   organizations.
   6.9.3. Make organization changes in IMDS using TRIC OGT, Program NFSD80.
   6.9.4. Communications units will ensure any required deactivation and/or transferring of
   organizations within IMDS are accomplished to ensure all status and inventory of equipment
   is properly transferred or lost.

AUTOMATIC TEST EQUIPMENT (ATE) INVENTORY, STATUS, AND UTILIZATION
                          REPORTING

Section 7A—Reporting System Overview

7.1. How and What To Report.
   7.1.1. The reporting requirements in this section are exempt from licensing in accordance
   with para-graph 2.11.3 of AFI 33-324. Report ATE through the appropriate MIS. Data is
   maintained in REMIS.
   7.1.2. For the purposes of this instruction, ATE includes:
       7.1.2.1. Test stations.
       7.1.2.2. Tester replaceable units (TRUs).
   7.1.3. The Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratories only report the inventory and
   status of ATE systems that are unique to a weapon system and mission-essential systems that
   don't have manual back-up.
7.2. Basic Reporting Concept.
   7.2.1. Each item of ATE is possessed by an Air Force training or maintenance organization
   (to include organizational, intermediate, or depot-level).
   7.2.2. The possessing unit reports:
       7.2.2.1. Possession and changes in possession.
       7.2.2.2. Conditions that change the ability of the ATE to do its mission (condition
       status).
       7.2.2.3. Configuration.
       7.2.2.4. Daily utilization.
7.3. Contractor Reporting. For contractor-controlled or maintained equipment, report the
inventory, status, utilization, and configuration on ATE Government-furnished equipment (GFE)
for contracts initiated after 1 October 1993. The administrative contracting officer sends the
needed reports to the agency that asked for them, unless the contract states otherwise.
7.4. The Reporting System. Data is processed at the unit level and at the REMIS processing
sites. MAJCOMs, HQ AFMC, HQ USAF, and other authorized users of the REMIS database
monitor the data.
   7.4.1. Units collect and input the data as shown in the applicable MIS users manual. Data is
   electronically transmitted at specified times to the REMIS database.
   7.4.2. HQ USAF, HQ AFMC, MAJCOMs, and other authorized users may extract reports,
   data, and information from REMIS to monitor and control ATE inventory, status, and
   utilization.
7.5. Security Classification. Do not report classified data under this instruction.

Section 7B—Reporting Responsibilities

7.6. Unit-Level Activities. All reporting starts at unit level.
   7.6.1. The designated ATE POC makes sure that ATE inventory, status, and utilization
   reporting is accurate and timely.
   7.6.2. A maintenance official (usually the ATE section or shop supervisor):
       7.6.2.1. Ensures that the unit correctly maintains inventory, maintenance status,
       utilization, and configuration data.
       7.6.2.2. Ensures that the unit reports data on all ATE at their work center (using the
       procedures in this instruction), including:
       7.6.2.3. Initial station or equipment inventory or changes.
       7.6.2.4. Initial TRU inventory or changes.
       7.6.2.5. Station or equipment status changes.
       7.6.2.6. Station or equipment utilization time.
       7.6.2.7. Checks the error file daily and corrects all ATE errors with help from the unit or
       host database manager (DBM) as needed.
       7.6.2.8. Works with MAJCOMs, ALCs, or contractor field teams to verify inventory,
       status, and utilization reporting.
   7.6.3. Units without access to an automated MIS work with their command headquarters to
   determine alternative procedures.
7.7. MAJCOMs:
   7.7.1. Work with other MAJCOMs, ANG, Air Force Reserve, and non-USAF organizations
   to move, ship, or transfer ATE and send applicable movement reports.
   7.7.2. Make sure that ATE chosen for transfer meets the desired configuration requirements
   and is made ready for transfer in accordance with TO 00-20-1, Preventive Maintenance
   Program and other transfer inspection requirements, as applicable.
   7.7.3. Help MAJCOM agencies in pulling ATE inventory, status, and utilization data from
   the REMIS database.
7.8. MAJCOM POCs:
   7.8.1. Check their reporting units to make sure that ATE inventory, status, utilization, and
   configuration appear in the REMIS database.
   7.8.2. Make sure that units take action to correct any reporting discrepancy or problem.
   7.8.3. Work together with the units as stated in paragraph 7.6.1. of this instruction.

                                             Chapter 8

      SPACE VEHICLE INVENTORY, STATUS, AND UTILIZATION REPORTING

Section 8A—Space Vehicle Reporting

8.1. Purpose. The purpose for tracking satellites is to have a single tracking tool within the
DoD to show an accurate status of assets. With the exception of inventory and financial
accountability reporting the reporting requirements in this section are exempt from licensing in
accordance with paragraph 2.11.5 of AFI 33-324. Each Space Wing and Product Center owning
space assets reports on their systems through IMDS and REMIS. The possessing unit reports the
inventory and status of those assets. Space Operational Unit personnel will collect and process
the information.
8.2. What is Reportable. Report all satellite systems through REMIS. Satellite systems will
include the satellite as a whole. The Weapon System Program Manager will enter the complete
acquisition cost of the satellite including the launch of the satellite in REMIS against the specific
satellite once the satellite is established by the AF AVDO.
8.3. Reporting Accuracy. Reports specified in this procedure are the basis for justifying and
defending AFSPC plans, programs, the budget, and to support the AF‘s CFO statement.
Accurate and timely reporting is critical. Errors in reporting can result in the loss of required
funding, manpower authorizations, and supplies.
8.4. Status Definitions.
   8.4.1. Green (Fully Mission Capable (FMC)): DoD owns the system and has declared the
   system operational.
   8.4.2. Amber (Partial Mission Capable (PMC)): DoD owns the system. It has been
   functionally turned over (DD Form 250) from contractor to DoD, but has not been declared
   operational. This is a transitional status and not indicative of satellite health (e.g. pending
   launch or on-orbit checkout).
   8.4.3. Red (Not Mission Capable (NMC)): The system is a contractor asset. It is not under
   control of the DoD.

Section 8B—Space Vehicle Responsibilities

8.5. Security Exemption.
   8.5.1. The classified status or locations of each satellite will not be entered in unclassified
   data systems. However, the official serial number of each satellite along with whether the
   satellite is in orbit, in storage (with the location of the storage facilities) or destroyed will be
   entered and maintained in REMIS.
   8.5.2. Specific data about satellite/system degradation is reported through secure operational
   means.
8.6. Inventory Reporting. Inventory reporting begins when an asset transfers to DoD
ownership (versus contractor owned). Reporting is accomplished by the applicable System
AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010                                                            71


Program Office (SPO) at the Product Centers until the system is fielded and declared operational.
Then asset reporting transfers to the operating Space Wing/unit.
   8.6.1. The SPO will establish a mission design series for each satellite program once the
   program is funded and provide this information to the AF-AVDO.
   8.6.2. The SPO will establish an official serial number for each satellite delivered to the AF
   regardless of its location (in space or in storage) and provide this information to the AF-
   AVDO as the satellite is accepted by the AF.
   8.6.3. The SPO or the organization accepting the satellite must send the first page of the DD
   Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, and a launch confirmation memo (if
   acceptance is on the launch pad) to the AF-AVDO for documentation under the CFO
   requirements.
       8.6.3.1. The launch date will be used as the placed in service date for all satellites in
       orbit. The DD Form 250 date will be used for all satellites accepted by the AF and held
       in storage.
       8.6.3.2. The SPO will enter the total cost of the satellite (including all launch costs)
       within 5 work days of the satellite entry being established by the AF AVDO.
       8.6.3.3. When a stored satellite is finally put in orbit, the SPO will enter a single
       modification entry in REMIS against that satellite with the cost of making the satellite
       whole plus the launch cost and using the launch date as the date of that modification.
   8.6.4. Each SPO will identify a primary and alternate CFO focal point. These
   individuals will be responsible for reviewing CFO information in REMIS, submitting any
   corrections and attesting to the information in REMIS as required.
   8.6.5. Possession Gain and Loss Criteria. Possession of an asset changes when the gaining
   unit accepts the operational control of the system. Systems will be accounted for as long as
   they are assigned to an Air Force activity under Air Force operational control.
   8.6.6. System/Mission Accountability. Assets will be accounted for as a whole per
   mission. The gaining unit will enter the asset into IMDS/REMIS upon operational control.
   This will include all associated booster and launch cost data.
8.7. Status Reporting. Follow the instructions for TRIC COX, Screen 996, Program NFSJR0
and TRIC EUC, Screen 997, Program NFSJQ0, in Air Force Computer Systems Manual 21-560,
Vol 2. Use local time (24-hour clock) for start and stop times.
8.8. Organization Record.
   8.8.1. The IMDS system identifies an organization by number, kind, type, and detachment
   number. There are two organizational fields; IMDS organization and 21-103.
       8.8.1.1. The 21-103 organization is used for up channel reporting to REMIS of status and
       inventory and follows the "G" Series Special Orders. Notify MAJCOM or FOA DBA
       before making the change.
       8.8.1.2. The IMDS organization is used for local identification. In most cases the IMDS
       and 21-103 organizations should be the same.
 72                                              AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010


   8.8.2. Assign a 4 digit organizational identification (ORG ID) only to actual units,
   detachments, and OLs. Report equipment and missions at unmanned sites and locations
   under the organization that has maintenance responsibility. You need not lose and regain the
   inventory to change the organization record.
       8.8.2.1. The first two positions of the ORG ID are the 2 digit command code which is up
       channel reported to REMIS as a 3 digit command code.
       8.8.2.2. The last two positions of the ORG ID are "00" for the basic (parent) unit; for
       example, use "1C00".
       8.8.2.3. For detachments or operating locations (OL), the last two positions of the ORG
       ID are the detachment number or operating location letter. For example, for Detachment
       2, use "1C02"; for OL "A" use "1C0A."
       8.8.2.4. For an OL of a detachment, use the detachment and the OL letter; for example,
       "1C2A".
8.9. Organization Changes.
   8.9.1. The MAJCOMs or FOAs must make organization changes in REMIS prior to any 21-
   103 organization change made in IMDS to avoid up channel reporting errors in IMDS (see
   para 8.8.1.1.).
   8.9.2. Make organization changes in IMDS using TRIC OGT, Program NFSD80
8.10. Notification Procedures. Notification of initial possession, or change in possession will
be done IAW paragraph 2.15. Message tailoring will be IAW HQ AFSPCI 21-103.

     I, II and III of the applicable -21 technical order to ensure on hand quantities are
     sufficient to meet unit needs. Use AF Form 2691 to maintain visibility of these items.
     Maintain one AF Form 2691 for each applicable line item in the -21 technical order.
     Accomplish and document annual inventories by placing the date in Block A and writing
     "INV" in Block E. Adjust quantities and locations accordingly. Units may place selected
     expendable assets on bench stock to serve as spares if consumption data warrants.
     Annotate levels established for bench stock items in Block J. Actual on hand level in
     bench stock need not be updated. Expendable assets placed in bench stock are exchanged
     on a one-for-one basis. Dash 21 items locally manufactured to replace -21 technical
     order items reference the same line item number as listed in the technical order.
     Additional locally manufactured items maintained, but not listed in the -21 technical
     order, reference local line item numbers, e.g., L-1, L-2, etc. Units develop local
     procedures to identify all locally manufactured items, accountable agency and
AFI21-103_AETCSUP_I 19 AUGUST 2010                                                           77

     air launched missile -21 assets.
  9.6.6. MAJCOMs, AFMC Centers or DLA identify items managed and controlled as
  expendables (XB3).
     9.6.6.1. Mark the -21 TO to show the maintenance activity must manage the items as
     expendables.
     9.6.6.2. As a rule, maintenance does not manage or control these items once they've been
     issued.
     9.6.6.3. Some items defined as expendables may require specific management
     procedures. For example, maintenance must have the right number of cables on-hand for
     ejector rack operation. MAJCOMs may choose to manage these items like the end item
     they are used with.
        9.6.6.3.1. Calculate total quantities authorized using quantities listed in applicable -
        21 technical orders multiplied by the number of assigned unit aircraft. Units manage
        all weapons related –21 equipment using AF Forms 2691 and supporting
        documentation. Variances in the authorized versus on-hand quantities of armament -
        21 requires Lead Command approval.
        9.6.6.3.1. (AETC) Quantity variances of armament –21 TO levels require HQ
        AETC/A4MSW approval.
        9.6.6.3.2. (Added-AETC) Accountable individuals monitor expendable (XB3)
        assets identified in sections I, II, and III of the applicable -21 TO to ensure on-hand
        quantities are sufficient to meet unit needs. The following guidance applies:
            9.6.6.3.2.1. (Added-AETC) If not automated use AF Form 2691,
            Aircraft/Missile Equipment Property Record, to maintain visibility of these
            items. Maintain one AF IMT 2691 for each applicable line item in the -21 TO.
            9.6.6.3.2.2. (Added-AETC) Use manual records (AF Form 2691) to accomplish
            and document annual inventories by placing the date in Block A and writing
            "INV" in Block E. Adjust quantities accordingly.
            9.6.6.3.2.3. (Added-AETC) Units may place selected expendable assets on
            bench stock to serve as spares if consumption data warrants. Annotate levels
            established for bench stock in Block J. Actual on-hand level in bench stock need
            not be updated.
            9.6.6.3.2.4. (Added-AETC) Expendable assets placed on bench stock are
            exchanged on a one-for-one basis. Exchange of item or AETC Form 138, Lost
            Tool or Item Investigation Record, is required to maintain accountability.
            Retain AETC Form 138 in Tab D of the custodial file for 1 year.
            9.6.6.3.2.5. (Added-AETC) Dash 21 items locally manufactured to replace -21

AVIONICS POD SYSTEM INVENTORY, STATUS AND UTILIZATION REPORTING

Section 10A—Reporting System Overview

10.1. Description of Pods. Electronic combat pods and other avionics pods are self-contained
systems, designed to be externally carried, and are interchangeable among the general class of
fighter, interceptor, strike, and reconnaissance aircraft. Pods are modularly constructed to
provide capabilities specific to aircraft mission requirements for training, self-protection against
enemy threat radar controlled weapons, airborne threats, navigational and target illumination,
instrumentation, and communications (telemetry and data link).
10.2. Description of RAMPOD. RAMPOD is an integrated weapons management information
system that collects, reports, and maintains real-time reliability, availability, maintainability,
configuration, warranty, system on-time, inventory, performance, sortie, and engineering
parametric data for externally carried electronic combat pods and other avionics pods. HQ
AF/A4 and SAF/FM have designated RAMPOD as the inventory and financial accountability
system for all AF externally carried pods, including leased pods. Financial reporting to Defense
Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) for all AF externally carried pods is accomplished via
RAMPOD. The RAMPOD financial module is generally compliant with the Chief Financial
Officer (CFO) Act of 1990, The Chief Information Act of 1996 and the Federal Managers
Integrity Act of 1996. As a result of diverse pod configurations and new technologies,
RAMPOD may track internal mounted pods as directed by MAJCOM or SPO. Also, other
systems may be reported in RAMPOD as directed by MAJCOM or SPO and approved by
AF/A4L in their capacity of Maintenance Systems Portfolio Owner.
10.3. How and What to Report.
   10.3.1. The reporting requirements in this section are exempt from licensing in accordance
   with paragraph 2.11.3 of AFI 33-324.
   10.3.2. As the accountability system, RAMPOD maintains accountability for all AF
   externally carried pods. RAMPOD must account for pod assets possessed by Air Force, Air
   National Guard, or US Air Force Reserve activities. Accountability begins when DD Form
   250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, is signed. All pod program offices are
   required to forward a DD Form 250 to RAMPOD for any new pods within 5 working days of
   the date title passes to the government. Accountability ends on receipt of a termination
   message and/or DD Form 1149, Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document. Deletions of
   pods from active inventory or any in-transit actions must be reported to RAMPOD within 5
   working days.
   10.3.3. The cost of any improvements (modifications) to pods must be reported in
   RAMPOD. Cost data for modifications or copies of DD Forms 250 must be forwarded to
   RAMPOD when the improvements performed by contract exceed $100K per pod.
   10.3.4. For the purpose of this instruction, the following data is reportable to
   RAMPOD:
       10.3.4.1. DD Form 250 for all pod acquisitions

       10.3.4.9. Current and assigned pod locations
       10.3.4.10. The Elapsed Time Indicator (ETI) meter readings. The frequency of ETI
       capture will be determined based on configuration and maintenance philosophy of the
       affected pod.
           10.3.4.10.1. Readings of external ETI meters will be captured for each action
           accomplished affecting the pod; to include aircraft installation/removal and any
           maintenance performed on the system.
           10.3.4.10.2. Readings of internal ETI meters will be captured on any maintenance
           action requiring de-paneling for maintenance and/or inspection.
       10.3.4.11. Changes in avionics pod ownership between Air Force, Air National Guard,
       or Air Force Reserve, changes in current and assigned pod location and support
       responsibility, to include all deployments, TDYs, and/or special missions.
       10.3.4.12. Any changes in pod status conditions impacting mission capabilities and/or
       readiness.
   10.3.5. Additional reporting requirements:

Mail copy 2 to the PS&D of the gaining organization.
Place copy 3 in the aircraft records binder for the aircraft being transferred.
Hold copy 4 for 30 days in case the gaining organization needs to resolve discrepancies
found during the acceptance inventory.
Gaining Organization:
Uses copy 2 or 3 of AF Form 2692 to conduct the acceptance inventory.
If there are shortages, review AFTO 781-series forms to determine if the missing equipment was
removed en route.
If the equipment was removed at an en route base (the transferring organization didn't ship
it), requests assistance from MAJCOM to resolve the shortage.
Adjusts AF Forms 2691 to show the equipment gained in the transfer.
