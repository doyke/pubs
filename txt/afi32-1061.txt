                                            Chapter 2

                                  PURCHASING UTILITIES

2.1. Utility Acquisition Authority. The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act
(FPASA) [40 U.S.C 501(a)] authorizes the General Services Administration (GSA) to manage,
procure and supply public utility services to the government. The FPASA also authorizes DoD
to procure utility service, accomplished in accordance with a DoD-GSA agreement.
2.2. Determining Utility Service Requirements.
   2.2.1. Validate that a utility requirement exists.
   2.2.2. Survey the utility requirement site for special problems or conditions.
   2.2.3. Evaluate alternative ways of acquiring utility service for large loads and decide which
   is the most economical and feasible.
   2.2.4. Use utilities supplied by other government agencies when feasible.
   2.2.5. Explore privatization initiatives before requesting military construction appropriations
   to construct or expand a government-owned plant or system.
   2.2.6. Do not construct or expand government-owned facilities when economical utilities are
   available from commercial sources and the reliability of the purchased utility service is
   consistent with mission requirements.
   2.2.7. Increase the reliability of purchased utilities using priority restoration of service
   agreements with the utility suppliers. Energy security should be considered and supported in
   utility agreements.
   2.2.8. Prepare utility service contract specifications, making sure that consumption and
   demand estimates are realistic. Attachments 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 contain utility service contract
   specification formats for potable water, sewage, steam, electricity, and natural gas.
   2.2.9. Check applicable published rate schedules to decide the most favorable rate schedule.
   If no published rate schedule is compatible with government demand and consumption
   requirements, assist base contracting in negotiating a favorable special rate.
2.3. Types of Purchased Utilities. Conversion charts for energy units may be found at:
http://www.think-energy.net/energy_units.htm.
   2.3.1. Electricity – Measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) (energy) and kilowatts (kW)
   (demand).
   2.3.2. Natural Gas – Measured in thousands of cubic feet (Mcf or kcf) and in million British
   thermal units (MBtu). The therm (thm) is a unit of heat energy equal to 100,000 British
   thermal units (Btu).
   2.3.3. Water – Measured in thousands of gallons (KGAL) or thousands of cubic feet (kcf).
   2.3.4. Wastewater (also called Sewage) – Measured in thousands of gallons (KGAL) or
   thousands of cubic feet (kcf).
   2.3.5. Steam – Measured in pounds (lbs) and in million British thermal units (MBtu).
 10                                                            AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011


   2.3.6. Stormwater is not a purchased utility. Stormwater charges are environmental impact
   fees or assessments and are not paid with utility funds.
2.4. Types of Utility Contracts.
   2.4.1. Support Agreements. Support agreements are used when acquiring utilities from
   another federal agency.
       2.4.1.1. When acquiring utilities from another Air Force organization or DOD agency,
       use a written support agreement to record the type and conditions of service (DOD
       Instruction [DODI] 4000.19, Interservice and Intragovernmental Support, August 9,
       1995).
       2.4.1.2. When acquiring utilities from another Federal agency, use a written interagency
       support agreement to record the type and conditions of service (FAR, Part 17.5).
   2.4.2. GSA Area-Wide Contracts. GSA area-wide contracts are master contracts entered
   into between the government and a utility service supplier to cover the utility service
   acquisitions of all Federal agencies in the franchised certified service territory for a period
   not to exceed 10 years. (See FAR, Part 41.) The Air Force should use the GSA area-wide
   contract if available in the region in which the base is located. A listing of the areawide
   public    utility     contracts    is   located    online   at    the    following     address:
   http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/contentView.do?contentType=GSA_DOCUMENT&c
   ontentId=12395&noc=T. The GSA area-wide contract has a specific contract number for
   each public utility, a signature page, and the required FAR clauses.
       2.4.2.1. Select the proper published rate or negotiate a special rate through GSA.
       2.4.2.2. Negotiate and add special provisions as needed.
       2.4.2.3. Add the installation's utility service specifications.
       2.4.2.4. Pay the bills/invoices in a timely manner, avoiding late fees.
   2.4.3. Direct Supply Natural Gas Program (DSNGP). The DoD policy is to competitively
   acquire natural gas via the DSNGP. DSNGP is managed by the Defense Energy Support
   Center (DESC). DESC awards a contract to a natural gas supplier and an installation may
   request to be a part of that contract via task order. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)
   arranges for transportation of the natural gas commodity via interstate pipelines to local
   distribution companies. The base arranges for transportation of the commodity from the
   interstate or intrastate pipeline through the local distribution company (LDC) system to the
   base distribution system as required. DLA evaluates the installation’s requirements.
   2.4.4. Separate Utility Service Contracts (See FAR, Parts 41.103(a)(2) and 41.305, and
   Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), Part 241). A separate utility service contract is used
   when the GSA area-wide contract is not available or separate contract is found to be more
   advantageous to the government. Ensure utility service contracts, agreements, and
   modifications are acceptable before sending to base contracting officer for execution.
       2.4.4.1. Negotiate the lowest overall cost commensurate with the installation’s
       requirements.
       2.4.4.2. Negotiate and add special provisions.
AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                     11


       2.4.4.3. Add the installation’s utility service specifications.
       2.4.4.4. Ensure the negotiated payment date is no earlier than 30 days from the date of
       billing. If the payment date must be earlier than 30 days from the date of billing, work
       with the utility provider on alternative charges in lieu of the earlier payment date. The
       Air Force and DFAS validation and routing processes make it difficult to meet a payment
       date earlier than 30 days, thus making the Air Force susceptible to late fees.
       2.4.4.5. Pay the bills in a timely manner avoiding late fees.
2.5. Acquiring Electric Service. Use the following options, in the preferred order of
preference, when determining best value for acquiring new electric service for the main base
       2.5.1. Supplier's (public or municipal utility) transmission voltage to supplier-owned
       substation, with distribution through a supplier- or privately owned distribution system.
       2.5.2. Supplier's transmission voltage to a government-owned substation, with the
       delivery point on the supplier’s side of the substation transformer (AFI 32-1063, Electric
       Power Systems) to a government-owned distribution system.
       2.5.3. Supplier’s transmission voltage to a supplier-owned substation (with a separate
       charge to the government for use of the facilities), with the delivery point on the
       government side of the substation transformer to a government-owned distribution
       system.
       2.5.4. Supplier’s transmission voltage directly to a government-owned distribution
       system when government system primary voltage is the same as the supplier’s
       transmission voltage.
       2.5.5. Supplier’s secondary voltage directly to a building load for small, localized loads.
       2.5.6. Government-owned central plant to a government-owned substation with
       distribution through a government-owned distribution system.
2.6. Acquiring Natural Gas Service. Use natural gas when it is the most economical fuel
available. The Defense Logistics Agency/Defense Energy Support Center (DLA/DESC),
Installation Energy Branch awards contracts for directly purchasing natural gas from producers,
thus the Air Force would be purchasing the commodity directly from the producer. DESC
arranges transportation of the natural gas via interstate pipelines to LDC and bases manage the
transportation of the commodity through the LDC system to the base distribution system.
Transportation may be acquired under a separate contract. Use the following options, in the
preferred order of preference, when determining best value for acquiring natural gas service:
       2.6.1. Local utility supplier’s (public or municipal utility) natural gas distributed using
       on-base distribution through a supplier or privately owned system.
       2.6.2. Local utility supplier’s (public or municipal utility) natural gas distributed using
       on-base distribution through a government-owned system.
       2.6.3. Competitively procured natural gas using on-base distribution through a supplier
       or privately owned system.
       2.6.4. Competitively procured natural gas using on-base distribution through a
       government-owned system.
 12                                                          AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011


2.7. Acquiring Water and Sewage Service. Use the following options when determining best
value for acquiring water and sewage service:
   2.7.1. For water for the main base, use in order of preference:
      2.7.1.1. Supplier’s (public or municipal utility) water with distribution through a supplier
      or privately owned distribution system.
      2.7.1.2. Supplier’s water with distribution through a government-owned distribution
      system.
      2.7.1.3. Government-owned water supply facilities through a government-owned
      distribution system.
   2.7.2. For sewage service for the main base, use in order of preference:
      2.7.2.1. Supplier’s (public municipal utility) treatment facilities with collection through a
      supplier- or privately owned collection system.
      2.7.2.2. Supplier’s treatment facilities with collection through a government-owned
      collection system.
      2.7.2.3. Government-owned treatment facilities through a government-owned collection
      system.
2.8. Connection and Termination Charges or Liability.
   2.8.1. Acquire utility service without a FAR, Part 41, termination liability or connection
   charge if possible. When a utility supplier builds electric generating capacity or transmission
   lines specifically for the installation, the termination liability amount or the connection
   charge can be substantial. If possible, negotiate a termination liability charge before offering
   a connection charge.
   2.8.2. Funds for termination charges are obligated when the actual termination of the
   contract occurs (31 U.S.C. 1501; and DOD 7000.14-R, DOD Financial Management
   Regulation, Volume 3, Budget Execution - Availability and Use of Budgetary Resources).
   2.8.3. Pay special attention to the minimum charge provision when using a definite-term
   utility service contract or any utility service contract with a termination liability. "Minimum
   monthly charge" means any minimum charges of the supplier's rate schedule that become
   payable if the government reduces its usage below the minimum or terminates the service.
   These charges occur in:
      2.8.3.1. Utility service contracts with a termination liability provision.
      2.8.3.2. Definite-term utility service contracts.
   2.8.4. Negotiate a refundable connection charge, if possible.
   2.8.5. Do not base a connection charge or termination liability on the utility supplier's entire
   construction cost. The connection charge shall never be more than the installation cost less
   net salvage value. Labor only installation costs do not have a salvage value. The supplier
   recovers some of the construction costs in the rate schedules. In arriving at fair and
   reasonable construction costs, consider the following:
      2.8.5.1. Permanency of load, annual load factor, and potential growth.
AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                      13


       2.8.5.2. Proposed construction cost applicable to Air Force and to other customers.
       2.8.5.3. Utility supplier's line extension policy and the amount of expansion cost
       included in rate schedules.
       2.8.5.4. Special considerations that the utility supplier accords to other large industrial
       customers.
       2.8.5.5. Added tax cost to the utility supplier if there is a contribution in aid of
       construction tax
2.9. Rate Schedules. Some utility suppliers offer several rate schedules for the same conditions
of service. Review the utility supplier’s rate schedules to determine which rate schedule applies
to the base and results in the lowest cost to the government. Some utility suppliers offer a choice
of energy and demand charges to large customers. One rate schedule includes high-energy
charges with low-demand charges and another rate schedule may include low-energy charges
with high-demand charges. Using the previous 12 months of billing data, analyze which rate
schedule offers the lowest cost based on historical data.
   2.9.1. Time-of-Day Rates. Determine whether to take service on a time-of-day rate. Some
   utility suppliers require large consumers to take such service, and some offer it as an
   alternative to other rates.
       2.9.1.1. Time-of-day rate schedules specify on-peak, off-peak, and a partial (or shoulder)
       peak period. The rates for energy and demand used during the peak period are higher
       than the rates for energy and demand during the off-peak period. The start, end, and
       duration of the peak period differ greatly among suppliers. When the installation shifts
       usage from the on-peak period to the off-peak period, utility bills can be reduced using
       time-of-day rates.
       2.9.1.2. Calculate the potential savings under a time-of-day rate schedule, using 12-
       month historical and 12-month projected billings for the installation.
   2.9.2. Interruptible Rates. Some utility suppliers offer interruptible service at a substantial
   savings over firm (non-interruptible) service. Interruptible service permits the utility supplier
   to temporarily discontinue service during peak demand hours. The utility supplier will give
   advance notice, ranging from a few minutes to several hours. The cost savings is
   proportional to the amount of advance notice the Air Force receives before the utility
   interruption.
   2.9.3. Demand Ratchets. Some rate schedules contain a demand ratchet provision, which is
   a means of applying a minimum billing to a customer who may have inconsistent or seasonal
   energy requirements. The utility supplier incurs costs by making the utility available to the
   Air Force when it needs it.
       2.9.3.1. If the existing rate schedule contains a demand ratchet and the base energy
       manager expects 1 month of abnormally high demand (caused by a construction project,
       equipment testing, or other factors), ask the contracting officer to negotiate with the
       utility supplier to avoid unnecessary demand charges for the next 12 months. The factor
       causing unusual demand must be estimated in advance for successful negotiations with
       the utility supplier.
 14                                                          AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011


       2.9.3.2. If the existing rate schedule contains a demand ratchet and the BCE expects the
       installation's load to decline (caused by demolition of buildings, installation of renewable
       energy source, or other factors), ask the contracting officer to negotiate with the utility
       supplier to delete the demand ratchet from the rate schedule.
   2.9.4. Standby Rates. Standby rates require the utility supplier to stand ready to serve the
   government’s load when the Air Force’s utility production facilities do not operate. The
   utility supplier provides a connection for use by the Air Force, and this connection is used
   when the Air Force is unable to produce enough energy from their own resources.
   2.9.5. Franchise Fee. Most utility suppliers obtain franchises from incorporated cities and
   towns within their service territory and may pay a fee based on the dollar amount of the
   utility bill for the use of the municipality's alleys, streets, and rights-of-way where
   distribution lines are located. Sometimes the supplier lists the franchise fee separately on the
   bill. Franchise fee issues are highly dependent on local and state tax law, and questions
   regarding whether an installation should pay such amounts should be referred to the
   installation legal office or the Utility Litigation Team.
2.10. Rate Changes. Requests for rate changes are processed differently for utility suppliers not
subject to an independent regulatory body than for suppliers subject to an independent regulatory
body.
   2.10.1. Power Marketing Administrations. Power Marketing Administrations request rate
   changes through a public participation process. They publish proposed rate changes in the
   Federal Register for public comments, and then hold public meetings to receive and discuss
   all oral and written comments. After considering all comments, they decide, approve, and
   publish the new rate.
   2.10.2. Utility Suppliers Not Subject to a Regulatory Body (Non-regulated Utility). Use the
   FAR 52.241-8 clause, "Change in Rates or Terms and Conditions of Service for Unregulated
   Suppliers," in utility service contracts. This clause allows either party to request a change in
   rates or terms and conditions of service, with both parties agreeing to enter into good faith
   negotiations concerning such changes. When the utility service contract provides for rate
   negotiation, the installation:
       2.10.2.1. Does not recognize rate changes for any amount until the parties agree to a
       mutually satisfactory rate and a date for the new rate to take effect, and then modifies the
       utility service contract to add the new rate.
       2.10.2.2. Makes payment at the old rate until the contracting officer modifies the utility
       service contract to add the new rate; during this period, ensures the financial manager
       commits enough funds to cover the possibility of retroactive payment based on the utility
       supplier's initially proposed rate increase (DOD 7000.14-R, Volume 3).
       2.10.2.3. Provides notification of a rate increase request in accordance with the
       guidelines in paragraph 2.10.3 below.
   2.10.3. Utility Suppliers Subject to an Independent Regulatory Body (Regulated Utility).
   Use the FAR 52.241-7 clause, "Change in Rates or Terms and Conditions of Service for
   Regulated Suppliers," in utility service contracts. This clause requires the Air Force to pay
AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                  15


  for utility service at the regulated rate. Promptly process a regulated supplier's request for
  change in rates.
     2.10.3.1. The BCE gives all known details to the base legal office, base contracting, and
     the MAJCOM within 24 hours of change notification.
     2.10.3.2. Installations located outside the continental United States (OCONUS) shall
     have the MAJCOM requests HQ AFCESA/CENR assistance, if needed.
     2.10.3.3. Installations in the United States shall have the MAJCOM inform HQ
     AFCESA/CENR within 24 hours if the potential increase to an installation is:
         2.10.3.3.1. More than $300,000 a year for electric or gas service. The MAJCOM
         notifies HQ AFCESA/CENR of fuel adjustment or purchased gas adjustment when
         circumstances warrant intervention.
         2.10.3.3.2. More than $200,000 a year for water or sewage service. The MAJCOM
         notifies HQ AFCESA/CENR of fuel adjustment or purchased gas adjustment when
         circumstances warrant intervention.
         2.10.3.3.3. Unreasonable, unjustified, or discriminatory.
     2.10.3.4. The base legal office informs AFLOA/ULT of the request for intervention.
     2.10.3.5. Within 1 week of the date that the MAJCOM informs HQ AFCESA/CENR of a
     proposed rate increase, the BCE provides to the MAJCOM (with information copies to
     base legal, base contracting, and HQ AFCESA/CENR):
         2.10.3.5.1. A list of all DoD activities being serviced by the utility company.
         2.10.3.5.2. The date the supplier filed the request for a change in rates with the
         regulatory body, the assigned docket number, the amount and the percent requested
         for total company revenue, and the amount and the percent of potential annual impact
         on the installation.
         2.10.3.5.3. A copy of the supplier's request for a change in rates (obtain from either
         the supplier or the regulatory body).
         2.10.3.5.4. The date, amount, and percent in total revenue of the supplier's last
         approved rate increase.
         2.10.3.5.5. A copy of the present and the proposed rate schedule.
         2.10.3.5.6. A comparison of the installation's costs under the present rate schedule
         versus the proposed rate schedule. (Calculate hypothetical monthly bills for each rate
         schedule, using 12-month historical and 12-month projected billings for the
         installation.)
         2.10.3.5.7. A copy of other rate schedules applicable to the installation that are more
         economical than the proposed rate schedule, along with a month-by-month
         comparison. If no other rate schedule is more economical, make a statement to that
         effect.
         2.10.3.5.8. A list of other Federal agencies and large industrial or commercial
         consumers receiving service under the same or similar rate schedules.
 16                                                          AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011


           2.10.3.5.9. A recommendation as to whether the proposed rate increase is unjustified,
           unreasonable, or discriminatory to the Air Force. Specify whether you recommend
           intervening or not intervening, and explain why.
       2.10.3.6. The MAJCOM promptly informs HQ AFCESA/CENR of its recommendation
       for AFCESA to intervene and provides TDY funding for utility rate intervention support
       and technical expertise.
       2.10.3.7. HQ AFCESA/CENR evaluates data received; coordinates with concerned
       MAJCOMs, branches of the Armed Forces, and other federal executive agencies; and
       decides whether intervention before a regulatory body is appropriate.
       2.10.3.8. If the decision is made to intervene, the federal executive agency constituting
       the largest energy user affected by the requested rate change will request intervention.
       Where the Air Force is the largest energy user, AFLOA/ULT will intervene on behalf of
       all federal executive agencies. Typically, AFLOA/ULT will draft and direct the base
       legal office to file the Notice of Intent to Intervene. The AFLOA/ULT attorney is the
       federal executive agency's spokesperson before the regulatory body.
       2.10.3.9. When the independent regulatory body approves and puts a new rate into
       effect, notify the financial manager of the financial impact and effective date of the new
       rate.
2.11. Utility Bills and Payment. The Asset Management Flight and the Resources Flight shall
coordinate to ensure utility bills are validated and processed for payment to avoid late fees (see
Figure 2.1. Model Utility Bill Payment Process). Faster processing is possible using electronic
mediums for billing and payment. If a utility provider does not have automatic electronic billing
services, ask the provider to fax or e-mail a scanned copy of the bill before mailing it.
   2.11.1. The Funds Manager (or Resource Advisor) in the Resource Flight may validate
   utility bills for payment if the energy manager or representative confirms the bill is correct.
   An e-mail from the energy manager or his representative is adequate for this confirmation.
   Utility bills shall be validated with the statement "The services covered by this invoice have
   been received and the amount of $<insert amount> is proper for payment. Errors in the
   invoice have / have not been identified and the utility company has been notified of these
   errors."
   2.11.2. A utility payment shall not be delayed due to billing errors. Ensure billing elements
   and rates comply with the most current contract rate. If any elements of the bill are incorrect,
   pay the amount that would be owed if the elements were correct. Notify the utility company
   of the discrepancy immediately and follow up with the utility company until the issues are
   resolved.
   2.11.3. Ensure the invoice contains applicable discounts.
   2.11.4. Ensure demand charges for periods immediately following power failures do not
   unfairly penalize the Air Force.
AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                 17


Figure 2.1. Model Utility Bill Payment Process.




   2.11.5. Analyze bills to determine whether:
      2.11.5.1. Power factor corrective measures should be taken.
      2.11.5.2. Demand should be rescheduled to off-peak periods.
      2.11.5.3. Demand is increasing.
      2.11.5.4. Demand controls are necessary.
      2.11.5.5. Load factors are changing.
      2.11.5.6. Utility conservation measures are not effective.
      2.11.5.7. Budgets should be modified.
      2.11.5.8. Contract demand is too low.
      2.11.5.9. Another rate schedule would be more economical.
   2.11.6. There are several methods of metering and billing from a utility provider. The most
   advantageous to the Air Force is one master meter and one monthly bill per utility provider.
   This is not always possible when Air Force facilities are geographically separated by large
   land masses. The preferred order of metering and billing for any utility services is as
   follows:
 18                                                           AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011


       2.11.6.1. One master meter and one monthly bill.
       2.11.6.2. Multiple meters with conjunctive (combined) billing.
       2.11.6.3. Multiple meters with separate billing for each meter.
2.12. Utility Purchase Contract Review. Review utility contracts annually and when a
contract is modified to ensure the Air Force is acquiring utilities at the most favorable rate
available and costs are minimized. Document this review using AF Form 3550, Annual Utility
Contract Review for Electric Service, AF Form 3551, Annual Utility Contract Review for Gas
Service, and AF Form 3552, Annual Utility Contract Review for Water and Sewage Service.
   2.12.1. Compare current cost trends to historical trends and analyze unusual or unexpected
   change.
   2.12.2. Determine whether current utility service requirements, including quality and
   quantity of service, are within the estimated demand, consumption, and other contract
   provisions. Do not reduce estimated maximum demand and consumption in existing
   contracts to coincide with current actual reduced demand and consumption unless such
   reduction results in a benefit to the government. Such reductions result in the loss of demand
   or consumption rights in connecting facilities.
   2.12.3. Review the utility supplier's applicable rates for the installation's actual usage,
   conditions, and characteristics of service. Make sure that the installation buys utilities at the
   most advantageous rate schedule.
   2.12.4. Make sure that metering and billing procedures are the most advantageous to the
   government.
   2.12.5. Maintain the review documentation. Make corrective actions for each discrepancy in
   the utility service folder.
   2.12.6. Provide the base contracting officer a copy of the updated information and a letter
   with recommended utility contract changes. When the review shows actual consumption or
   demand exceeds contract quantities, prepare a new service specification (see Attachments 4,
   5, 6, 7, and 8) to be added to the contract.
2.13. Utility Service Folders. Installations shall keep a utility service folder for each supplier
providing utilities to the installation. The folder is a tool for managing purchased utilities. See
Attachment 3 for a list of folder contents. This folder is not required at installations where
another agency purchases the utilities for the Air Force.
AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                     19


                                            Chapter 3

                        PRODUCING AND MANAGING UTILITIES

3.1. Ownership of On-Base Utility Systems. On-base utility distribution and production
systems are owned, operated, and maintained either by the government, a local municipality,
public or private utility provider, a utilities privatization contractor-owner, or a housing
privatization contractor-owner.
3.2. Government Owned. Government owned systems normally indicate the Air Force is
responsible for construction, operations, maintenance, and repair for the utility production and
distribution system from the base fence or real estate boundary to the point of utility delivery to
the customer. If the government does not produce the utility, the government purchases the
utility from an off-base provider. Costs to provide utilities to the end user include the purchased
utility and the operations, maintenance, repair, and construction to the distribution system.
   3.2.1. Limit the off-base utility supplier’s ownership to that part of the system needed to
   connect the utility supplier's service delivery to the base. This delivery point is normally at
   or near the base real estate boundary.
   3.2.2. The Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) will follow
   the policy on ownership and operation of ANG and AFRC on-base utility distribution
   systems as set forth in Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Installations (SAF/IEI)
   memorandums.
3.3. Public or Private Utility Provider Owned. These utility systems are wholly owned and
operated by the provider that also produces the utility for the local area. The point of utility
delivery is directly to the facility consuming the utility. The government is not responsible for
the maintenance or operations of any part of the distribution system including metering the
consumption.
3.4. Utility Privatization (UP) Owned. If the on-base utility system has been privatized, it will
be owned, operated, and maintained by a UP contractor-owner. The privatized utility system
may include production, distribution, collection, generation and treatment facilities. The UP
contractor- owner may be a private company or a local utility company. UP contracts are utility
service contracts with a maximum term of 50 years (10 U.S.C 2688, Utility Systems, Conveyance
Authority).
   3.4.1. If the UP contractor-owner is not the local or current utility provider, the UP
   contractor-owner charges will be a separate charge and additional to the commodity or utility
   company billing.
   3.4.2. If the UP contractor-owner is also the local utility provider, then the UP costs may be
   included in the utility bill, depending on the structure of the utility contract.
3.5. Housing Privatization (HP) Owned. If HP results in the utility system associated with the
housing area transferred to the HP contractor-owner and Air Force facilities are located within
the housing area, utility service for these facilities will be acquired according to the following
options:
 20                                                            AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011


   3.5.1. HP Distribution System Owned by Local Utility. If the local utility company becomes
   the provider of utility service to the privatized housing area, then the installation shall
   procure utility service from the local utility company for the Air Force facilities within the
   HP owned area in accordance with this instruction.
   3.5.2. HP Distribution System Owned by HP Contractor-Owner. If the HP contractor-owner
   operates the utility distribution system in the privatized housing area, the government
   (installation) may provide utility service on a reimbursable basis to the HP contractor-owner.
   If the government (installation) provides the commodity to the HP contractor-owner, the HP
   contractor-owner will provide wheeling service without charge to the Air Force facilities
   located on the housing utility distribution system. Meters will be installed to measure the
   quantity delivered exclusively to the Air Force facilities. These meters will be read monthly,
   and this usage deducted from the metered quantities delivered by the government
   (installation) to the HP contractor-owner.
3.6. Operations, Maintenance, and Repair Costs. The operations, repair, and maintenance
costs associated with government owned production and distribution utility systems comes from
work orders, maintenance service contracts, and projects. Coordinate with the Operations Flight
for work order and maintenance service contract data and the Programs Flight for project data.
   3.6.1. The Operations Support element in the Operations Flight shall provide a monthly and
   annual work order report showing all work completed on utility systems. This could include
   a variety of account codes depending on the Operations Flight and Resource Flight
   procedures. The Operations Flight shall ensure the work associated with the utility systems
   is properly and accurately documented into the IWIMs database and that labor, materials,
   equipment, vehicles, and supplies are included in work accountability.
   3.6.2. Work associated with utility systems includes (but not limited to) work on piping, lift
   stations, transformers, valves, lines, conduit, overhead electrical poles, electrical vaults,
   water wells, water hydrants, sewer manholes, primary power electrical generators, waste
   water treatment and collection plants, etc. Work on utility systems normally begins on five
   feet away from the exterior wall of a building. Work performed on and in buildings or
   facilities is not normally a utility cost unless the building is for the exclusive production or
   distribution of a utility. Street lighting and traffic controls are not considered utility costs so
   ensure work order information does not include costs for work on these systems.
   3.6.3. Sample civil engineer utility account codes and real property category codes useful in
   analyzing utility costs are in Attachment 2.
   3.6.4. A work report will include all costs associated with operations, repair, and
   maintenance. These costs include:
       3.6.4.1. Military labor.
       3.6.4.2. Civilian labor.
       3.6.4.3. Materials.
       3.6.4.4. Chemicals.
       3.6.4.5. Equipment.
       3.6.4.6. Government owned laboratory.
AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                21


       3.6.4.7. Sludge disposal.
       3.6.4.8. Permit fees.
       3.6.4.9. Service maintenance contract costs.
3.7. Project and Capital Investment Costs. Major repair, large maintenance work, minor
construction and new construction costs associated with government owned production and
distribution utility systems normally comes from projects. Coordinate with the Programs Flight
for project data.

                                           Chapter 4

                                  PROVIDING UTILITIES

4.1. Utility Service Agreements. Title 10 U.S.C. 2686 authorizes the Secretary of the Air
Force or his or her designee to sell utilities and related services to purchasers within or in the
immediate vicinity of an Air Force installation. Title 10 U.S.C. 2872a authorizes the Secretary
of the Air Force to furnish certain utilities and services on a reimbursable basis in connection
with military family housing (MFH) privatization that is located on a military installation.
Proceeds collected for utility service sales are credited to the appropriated account used for the
utility or related service. Utility service agreements must be in writing and signed by the
purchaser, the BCE (or MAJCOM Civil Engineer as listed below), and the installation
commander (or his or her designee) and attached to a valid support agreement or lease (see
Figure 4.1. for appropriate forms and corresponding customer classifications). Keep the original
agreements and send copies to the purchaser, base accounting and finance office, and the base
CE resource advisor.
   4.1.1. Use AF Form 3553, Utility Sales Agreement for Non-Federal Organizations, for non-
   Federal organizations. In addition to the BCE approval, the MAJCOM Civil Engineer must
   also approve the AF Form 3553 for any sales occurring off the installation property.
   4.1.2. Use AF Form 3554, Utility Service Agreement for DOD Agencies and Non-DOD
   Federal Agencies, for DOD and non-DOD Federal agencies. A purchaser with activities in
   several facilities, such as the Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR), shall have only one
   AF Form 3554. When additional space is needed, add in paragraph 5 of the form, "See
   attached memorandum which lists each activity, facility, and address to be served".
   4.1.3. Use AF Form 4386, Utility Service Agreement for Privatized Military Family
   Housing, to provide service to privatized housing contractors. The MAJCOM civil engineer
   approves the AF Form 4386, Utility Service Agreement for Privatized Military Family
   Housing, to provide service to military housing privatization projects.
       4.1.3.1. Installations receiving Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) electricity
       should contact AFCESA/CENR to ensure that privatization will not result in the loss of
       the WAPA power allocation.
   4.1.4. Use AF Form 3555, Utility Sales Rates Exhibit ___, attached as Exhibit A in AF Form
   3554 service agreements and Exhibit B in AF Form 3553 sales agreements for documenting
   resale or reimbursable utility rates. This form may be updated as often as necessary to reflect
   rate changes. This form is signed and approved by the Base Civil Engineer. The purchaser
   does not sign this form. (See paragraph 4.7.1.4.)
   4.1.5. Ensure the purchaser complies with energy conservation procedures. Inspect
   modifications and additions the purchaser makes to their facilities for energy efficiency and
   conservation.
   4.1.6. When adding, deleting, or changing addresses for activities listed in AF Form 3554
   and AF Form 3553, attach a memorandum signed by the BCE to the existing AF Form rather
   than creating a new sales agreement. It is not necessary to supersede, rewrite, or issue a new
   AF Form 3553 or AF Form 3554 when making minor changes or additions.
AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                       23

4.2. Restrictions. The installation commander may sell utilities and related services to a non-
Federal organization on or in the immediate vicinity of an Air Force installation only if all the
following apply:
   4.2.1. The sale serves the interest of national defense or the public interest.
   4.2.2. The service is not available from local private or public suppliers (the person
   responsible for utilities management makes this determination annually; if there is a local
   source, the BCE will discontinue service as soon as possible). An exception to this
   requirement is that service to privatized MFH can be provided even if available locally. (10
   U.S.C. 2872[a]).
   4.2.3. The sale does not disrupt present or planned service to the Air Force.
   4.2.4. Any minor expansion or extension of Air Force utility distribution systems or facilities
   needed to make the sale does not hinder the construction of similar public or private
   facilities.
   4.2.5. The service is sold to the purchaser for their consumption, not for resale.
4.3. Provided Without Reimbursement.
   4.3.1. Provide utilities without reimbursement to approved organizations as listed in a DOD
   or Air Force Directive, Regulation, or Instruction. These publications permit approved
   organizations to operate on the installation and receive utilities without reimbursement.
   Examples are:
       4.3.1.1. Organizations operating in buildings, structures, and facilities located on Air
       Force-owned or -leased real property and funded with Air Force-appropriated money.
       See AFI 65-601 Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, for additional information,

       4.4.3.9. Contractors working on an installation and their contract does not provide
       government furnished utilities.
       4.4.3.10. Housing privatization contractor.
4.5. Selling Water to Non-Federal Customers. The regulatory status under the Federal and
state Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) may be negatively impacted when water is sold to non-
Federal customers. Coordinate with the base bioenvironmental engineer and the environmental
manager to determine regulatory controls of selling safe drinking water.
4.6. Base Closure Locations. AFRPA determines the utility rates for local redevelopment
authorities at bases undergoing closure.
   4.6.1. AFRPA establishes a sales utility rate that maximizes reimbursement to the Air Force
   yet is economical for local redevelopment. AFRPA updates the sales rate if there is a
   significant change in conditions (such as an increase in reuse).
   4.6.2. The utility sales rate shall be no less than the local prevailing rate for similar services.
4.7. Calculating Utility Reimbursement Rates.
   4.7.1. Use AF Form 3556, Utility Sales Rates Computation Worksheet, to compute utility
   rates. An approved electronic worksheet is available on the Air Force Facility Energy/Utility
   Program           Community             of           Practice           website           at:
   https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO
   -EN-CE-A4-27&Filter=OO-EN-CE-A4.
       4.7.1.1. Monitor the impact of utility provider rate changes using AF Form 3556, Utility
       Sales Rates Computation Worksheet.
       4.7.1.2. Rate increases/decreases from utility companies shall be passed along to base
       customers as they occur.
       4.7.1.3. Annual updates of AF Form 3555 are mandatory and include the previous 12
       months of actual costs to computed sale rates. Annual updates shall be effective 1 Jan of
       each year.
AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                     27


       4.7.1.4. Provide the finance office with a copy of updated AF Form 3555. Ensure the
       form shows the date of rate change and the first billing month of the new rate. If utility
       rates change during the year before 1 Jan, notify the customer with a memo in their
       monthly utility bill.
   4.7.2. Computing Utility Reimbursement Rates. The most efficient method to calculate
   utility rates is to use AF Form 3556 utilizing the link in paragraph 4.7.1. The information
   below is intended to be used with the form. The form also includes comments in each area
   that explains the information that is required for each cell. Data is entered into the yellow
   shaded cells. Formulas are automatic and cannot be changed without written approval from
   AFCESA/CENR. Utility reimbursement rates are calculated by adding cost factors shown in
   Table 4.2. and explained in the following paragraphs:
       4.7.2.1. Capitalized Investment Cost of Facilities. Capitalized costs are directly related
       to the maximum capacity of the utility system. The total capital investment of the system
       is found in the Real Property Inventory Record, AF Form 7115. The real property
       manager provides this information to the energy manager.

Figure 4.1. Capitalized Investment Cost of Facilities.
Capitalized Investment Costs ($) =
(Original Cost to Construct + Cost of All MILCON + Cost of All Repairs by
Replacement) – Cost of Any Component Removed
       4.7.2.2. Total Annual Maximum Capacity of Utility System. The total annual maximum
       capacity is the maximum amount of the utility that a system can carry at a particular
       moment (in kilowatts, gallons, or millions of BTUs) multiplied by the total units of time
       in a year (525,600 minutes or 8,760 hours). Generating capacity denotes the maximum
       amount of power or commodity that can be produced by a given facility. Load capacity
       or transmission capacity denotes the maximum amount of energy that can be transmitted
       through a system or maximum amount of capacity that a utility provider will deliver.
       Flow capacity is measured in tons, cubic feet or cubic meters, and indicates the maximum
       amount of gas or liquid that can be transported through a pipeline. Capacity can vary
       depending on the current state of the system or its capabilities at a given moment, so it is
       not a fixed or absolute value. For example, a generator's capacity may increase or
       decrease depending on the type or mixture of fuel used, and a gas pipeline's capacity will
       vary with changes in the ambient air temperature. For example, the total annual
       maximum capacity for electricity is multiplied by 8760 hours in a year. kWh =
       MW*1000*8760 as follows:

Figure 4.2. Total Annual Maximum Capacity for Electricity (kWh).
Total Annual Maximum Capacity for Electricity (kWh) =
Contracted Maximum for Purchased Electricity + Maximum Capacity for
Generated Electricity  8760
       4.7.2.3. Basic Cost. The basic cost is the total annual cost of a utility purchased and
       produced divided by the annual total consumption. The basic cost includes ESPC,
       UESC, and UP costs as shown in Table 4.2. Utility Rate Chart - Utility Rate Factors.
 28                                                         AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011


          4.7.2.3.1. When purchasing utility service, divide the total annual purchased cost by
          the annual consumption.
          4.7.2.3.2. If an Air Force-owned plant generates the utility commodity, divide the
          cost of production/generation by the total consumption (or estimated consumption if
          consumption not metered).
          4.7.2.3.3. When using a combination of Air Force produced and purchased services,
          total both the purchases and the produced costs and divide by the total consumption.
          4.7.2.3.4. UP Charges. When utility systems on the installation are owned by a UP
          contractor/owner, the Air Force pays for the UP owner to operate and maintain these
          systems in one of two ways:
              4.7.2.3.4.1. Incremental UP Charges. If the base utility system has been
              privatized and there are incremental UP charges, the UP cost is calculated by
              dividing the total annual UP charges by the annual utility system consumption.
              4.7.2.3.4.2. Bundled Commodity UP Charges. If all delivery charges (including
              charges for on-base distribution) are bundled with the commodity charges, no
              calculation is necessary; there is no incremental UP charge.
          4.7.2.3.5. Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC) or Utility Energy Services
          Contract (UESC) are used for energy conservation measures. The UESC charges
          may be included in the monthly utility purchased utility bill as a bundled cost to the
          Air Force. Ensure the ESPC and UESC costs are not added twice to the AF Form
          3556 if they are billed as a bundled charge.

Figure 4.3. Basic Cost.
Basic Cost ($/unit) =
(Total Cost Purchased Utility +/- (ESPC Charges + UESC Charges + UP
Charges) *as applicable + Total Cost Produced Utility) ÷ Total Consumption
       4.7.2.4. Connection Fee Charges. Connection fees are billed with the monthly purchased
       utility bill. The MWR and AAFES reimbursable rate is reduced by any connection fees
       paid by the Air Force, therefore, subtract the connection fees from the MWR and AAFES
       utility reimbursement rate as shown in Table 4.2. Utility Rate Chart - Utility Rate
       Factors.

Figure 4.4. Connection Fee Charges.
Less Connection Fee Charge ($/unit) =
Total Connection Fee Charges ÷ Total Consumption
       4.7.2.5. Distribution Line Losses or Gains. The energy loss in the Air Force
       transmission and distribution system (or gains in the Air Force collection system) refers
       to the difference in the amount of energy delivered to a distribution system and amount of
       energy delivered to the customer. Line loss may be estimated or may be calculated by a
       qualified engineer. The Air Force normally uses an estimated 10 percent energy loss if
       the amount of loss is unknown.
AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                   29


          4.7.2.5.1. When estimating wastewater services, if the user's flow is metered or
          estimated from its facilities, increase the commodity cost by 10 percent or determine
          the actual infiltration and use that number to increase the commodity cost.
          4.7.2.5.2. When estimating industrial wastewater, if the user's flow is estimated from
          the metered flow through the industrial wastewater treatment plant, the meter
          readings already include line inflow or infiltration.

Figure 4.5. Distribution Line Losses or Gains.
Line Loss (Gain) ($/unit) =
(Basic Cost +Other Utility Cost)  Percentage Line Loss
       4.7.2.6. System O&M Cost. Determine the Air Force transmission, distribution, and
       collection system annual O&M costs per unit of service from work order and project
       information. When the Air Force owns, operates, and maintains a utility distribution
       system, the base pays for these expenses with BCE appropriated funds. O&M costs are
       tracked by the Operations Flight and the Programs Flight depending on who performs the
       work and how the work is performed (contract or in-house). Customers receiving
       utilities from the Air Force share the burden of these costs depending on the customer’s
       classification as shown in Table 4.2. Utility Rate Chart - Utility Rate Factors.
          4.7.2.6.1. System operations and maintenance costs include all routine maintenance
          and repair. If the repair does not add value or capacity, does not change the type of
          system (such as removing an overhead utility line and replacing it with an
          underground line), or upgrades the system (such as replacing an old distribution
          system with the same size but new system), consider the repair to be routine
          maintenance and repair, and include the repair in system operations and maintenance
          cost.
          4.7.2.6.2. Work on the system is performed by work order, service contract, and
          construction contract. Expenses included in this work include labor, equipment,
          materials, chemicals, supplies, tools, and vehicles. Collect the data applicable to all
          possible sources of work on the system and include all items of expenses.
          4.7.2.6.3. Projects are normally programmed a year or more in advance of execution
          and the energy manager should let customers know of future rate increases.
          Customers can plan for the increased expenses by budgeting for the increased costs.
          This can be accomplished by preparing a draft future AF Form 3556 with the
          proposed large project costs included and notifying the customer of the estimated
          future costs of their utilities.
          4.7.2.6.4. The real property capitalized costs definitions are used to determine work
          that is considered O&M and work that is considered a capitalized investment.
          Military construction projects (MILCON) are usually capital investment costs but
          Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (SR&M) projects are normally O&M
          costs. Exceptions may exist so coordinate with Resources Flight to determine what
          costs apply to the O&M category and what costs apply to the capitalization charges.
 30                                                          AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011


          4.7.2.6.5. Complete a ―sole benefit test‖ (see Figure 4.6. Sole Benefit Test for
          Determining O&M Costs) to determine what portion of the system and its associated
          charges apply to DOD, MFH, MHPI, and Federal customers as shown in Table 4.2.
          Utility Rate Chart - Utility Rate Factors. These customers are charged O&M costs
          for the portion of the system provided solely for their benefit (DODI 4000.19).
Figure 4.6. Sole Benefit Test for Determining O&M Costs.




Figure 4.7. System O&M Cost.
O&M Costs ($/unit) =
Total Cost Operations, Maintenance, and Repair ÷ Total Consumption
       4.7.2.7. Other Utility Costs. Determine the cost of ancillary utility service required to
       provide the utility service, such as heat for a water treatment plant, the cost of electric
       power used to pump water, the cost of chilled water or potable water to pump and treat
       wastewater, and the cost of electricity to operate lift stations and wastewater treatment
       plants. Use the ―Other Utilities‖ section of AF Form 3556 to compute other utility costs
       associated with producing and distributing a utility service as shown in Table 4.2. Utility
       Rate Chart - Utility Rate Factors.

Figure 4.8. Other Utility Costs.
Other Utility Costs ($/unit) =
(Total Cost Purchased Other Utility + Total Cost Produced Other Utility + Total
Cost O&M Other Utility) ÷ Total Consumption Other Utility
       4.7.2.8. Military Labor Costs. Military labor cost will be included as a separate item in
       the IWIMs reports from the Operations Flight. Military labor is deducted from rates for
       DoD federal agencies as shown in Table 4.2. Utility Rate Chart - Utility Rate Factors.
AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                      31


       Civilian and contract labor costs are included in reimbursable rates to all customers, thus
       a higher resale rate results when using civilian or contract labor for work performed on
       on-base utility systems.

Figure 4.9. Military Labor Costs.
Less Military Labor Cost ($/unit) =
((Total Cost Produced Utility + Total Cost O&M Utility) – Total Military Labor
Cost) ÷ Total Consumption
       4.7.2.9. Capitalized Investment Charges. The capitalized investment charges are passed
       on to the customer. They are the total capital investment cost divided by the total annual
       maximum capacity (not output) of the plant as shown in Table 4.2. Utility Rate Chart -
       Utility Rate Factors. Capitalized charges do not include all project costs. They include
       only those projects that meet real property capitalization investment costs. Repair and
       maintenance project costs are part of the operations and maintenance costs described in
       4.7.2.6. System O&M Costs.

Figure 4.10. Capitalized Investment Charges.
Capitalized Charges ($/unit) =
(Total Capitalized Cost ÷ Total Annual Maximum Capacity)  10%
       4.7.2.10. Administrative Overhead. The Administrative Overhead charge is equal to 3
       percent of the total unit costs for all other charges as shown in Table 4.2. Utility Rate
       Chart - Utility Rate Factors.

Administrative Overhead Charges ($/unit) =
(Total Basic Cost + Line Loss + O&M Costs + Other Utility Costs + Capitalized
Charges)  3%

       4.7.2.11. Local Prevailing Rate. The local prevailing rate is the rate the purchaser would
       pay for a particular class of service if the customer were provided the utility directly by
       the nearest off-base utility supplier as shown in Table 4.2. Utility Rate Chart - Utility
       Rate Factors. Local prevailing rates are normally published through the local utility
       company’s online website and they include categories for various residential types,
       commercial, industrial, and other special rated categories. Analyze the customer’s
       service requirements to determine which local rate schedule would apply if the customer
       purchased the utility directly from a local utility provider. If an applicable rate equals or
       exceeds the cost to the government for supplying the service, use the local utility
       provider’s rate. If two or more rates apply equally but exceed the cost to the government
       for supplying the service, use the lower of the two applicable rates. Do not charge the
       local prevailing rate when a Department of Energy Power Marketing Administration is
       one of the installation's utility suppliers or when the use of the local prevailing rate
       directly conflicts with a utility supplier's regulation.
 32                                                           AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011


4.8. Wheeling Charge. A wheeling charge is applicable when an on-base tenant or privatized
contractor purchases utility service directly from the local utility service provider. The
government may allow utility suppliers to use government-owned, distribution systems to
transport utilities to on-base organizations with extremely large utility consumption if adequate
capacity is available. The contracting officer adds a wheeling charge provision to the utility
contract. Most utility suppliers will not agree to wheel due to the expense of installing and
reading meters, obtaining security to get on base, and processing monthly utility bills. It is
usually more advantageous to the government for suppliers to wheel to non-Federal customers
with extremely large utility consumption such as a privately owned industrial plant or large
privately owned hotel. It is not advantageous to wheel to small users such as banks and credit
unions. The base energy manager verifies proper wheeling amounts are deducted on the monthly
invoice, and annually recalculates the wheeling charge. The contracting officer modifies the
utility service contract no later than 1 January each year to update the wheeling charge.
   4.8.1. The wheeling charge is the total of the line loss, operations, maintenance, and repair
   costs, other utility costs, capitalized charges, and administrative overhead.

Figure 4.12. Wheeling Charge.
Wheeling Charge ($/unit) =
Total Line Loss Unit Rate + O&M Cost Unit Rate + Other Utility Cost Unit Rate +
Capitalized Charge Unit Rate + Administrative Overhead Unit Rate
   4.8.2. Use the following sample wheeling charge provision in a utility service contract:
“In consideration for the use of government-owned, on-base distribution systems to
transport utilities to (show the name and address of the non-Federal organizations), the
utility supplier agrees to include on the monthly invoice to the installation a deduction for
the amount of utilities consumed by the non-Federal organizations and a deduction to
cover the wheeling charge of (show the amount) per (show the unit of measurement [kWh,
Mcf, Btu or kgal]). Annually, the base energy manager recalculates the wheeling charge
according to AFI 32-1061, using prior fiscal year cost data, and gives the utility supplier
the updated wheeling charge, which takes effect on 1 January. The government may
revoke this provision with a 30-day written notice to the utility supplier.”
4.9. Utility Invoices and Payment. The Resources Flight processes invoices for
reimbursement. The energy manager provides the funds manager a monthly spreadsheet
showing the customer, consumption, and reimbursement rate no later than 10 days after the
utility provider billing date. The CER funds manager prepares the invoices. Depending on the
base billing process, CER or DFAS mails the invoices to the reimbursable customer. CER shall
ensure customers are reimbursing for utilities and paying late fees if applicable.
4.10. Billing Waivers. The energy manager may waive billings for Air Force, DOD and
Federal customers when the accumulated charges for a reimbursable customer are less than $125
for any calendar quarter. EXCEPTION: This waiver does not apply and billing may not be
waived for DWCF or non-Federal customers. (AFI 65-601V1, Sections 7.10 and 7.23.)
4.11. Utility Reimbursable Rate Review. Complete AF Form 3557, Utility Service Annual
Review, no later than 1 January of each year, to record the annual review and changes in utility
AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                   33

                         MEASURING UTILITY CONSUMPTION

5.1. Meters. A vital component of the Air Force’s energy program is measuring utility usage by
installing meters (electric, natural gas, steam, and water) where appropriate, thus allowing for
informed decisions and improved energy efficiency.
   5.1.1. Utility purchase contracts have provisions specifying meter calibration and refunds
   due the government when meters are not calibrated correctly. The base energy manager
   keeps a copy of the latest meter calibration test for each meter in the utility service folder.
   Calibration for meters owned by the utility provider is the responsibility of the utility
   provider.
5.2. Funding Meter Installation. Use construction funds to install meters on new and
renovated facilities. Advanced meters shall be installed on all utility systems renovations
exceeding $200K, new MILCON, major renovations, Energy Conservation Investment Program
projects and Energy Savings Performance Contract projects.
   5.2.1. Meters are required at all existing facilities when cost effective. (Cost-effectiveness
   criteria is defined in the latest Air Force Facility Metering Policy guidance available on the
   Air Force Facility Energy/Utility Program Community of Practice website at:
   https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO
   -EN-CE-A4-27&Filter=OO-EN-CE-A4.
   5.2.2. Water meters shall be located at all installation potable water entry/service points, on
   base well water facilities and at all location where the annual usage exceeds 2 million
   gallons. Steam shall be measured at central steam plants in accordance with Air Force
   Instruction 32-1068, Heating Systems and Unfired Pressure Vessels (1 Oct 1998).
   5.2.3. Meter government-owned family housing using a master metering system according
   to Military Handbook (MIL-HDBK) 1190, Facility Planning and Design Guide, Chapter 13,
   paragraph 12.
   5.2.4. Meter privately owned (privatized) military family housing areas. As a minimum,
   there shall be a master meter located at the line of demarcation between the base utility
   consumption and the line that feeds directly to the housing area. These privatized housing
   area meters shall be purchased and installed using the privatized contractor’s funds but
   meters shall meet Unified Facility Guide Specifications requirements and the BCE shall
   approve installation of the meter. Meters shall be installed within 30 days after contract
   award for the privatized housing.
   5.2.5. Meter government-owned facilities located within a privatized military housing area.
   These meters shall be purchased and installed with government funds.
5.3. Meter Consumption Data and Reading. Until advanced meters are fully operational and
providing daily consumption data, meter consumption data shall be collected monthly on the
same day as the local utility provider reads the base master delivery point meter. The energy
manager uses the meter data to verify utility bill information is correct and to determine
reimbursable customer consumption for utility resale billing. Normally, shop personnel from the
 36                                                          AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011


Operations Flight perform meter reading when automatic reading capability does not exist. The
energy manager will also use AMR consumption data for energy conservation monitoring and
reporting as these advanced meters become fully operational.
   5.3.1. Meter readings shall include type meter, meter identification number, meter location;
   multiplier and unit of measurement; prior and present month's reading and date; number of
   days between readings; consumption; and signature and phone number of the meter reader.
   Use the daily average consumption of any representative period in the event a meter fails.
   5.3.2. Keep meter data and billing information for the last 24 months easily accessible. All
   meter information will be stored electronically for 7 years. Annually check the information
   to determine if consumption is nearing the utility system capacity. If actual consumption is
   nearing capacity, coordinate with the Programs Flight to analyze the infrastructure for
   possible capital improvements. Coordinate with the community planning function and the
   programming function to determine future requirements.
5.4. Utility Consumption Estimating. Estimate present and future requirements (consumption)
as realistically as possible. Consider temporary meters for estimating facilities that consume
large quantities of energy and water.
   5.4.1. Overestimating requirements (consumption) will result in excessive connection
   charges and unreasonable minimum charges. When actual demand is below the contract
   minimum demand, the installation pays for more service than it actually uses.
   5.4.2. Underestimating requirements (consumption) will result in inadequate plant and
   system capacity, additional connection charges, and a higher unit cost for service based on a
   low consumption rate schedule.
   5.4.3. Prepare a detailed engineering estimate for utility consumption for each facility (or
   customer) without a functioning meter. Consumption estimates will include the parking lot
   lighting that belongs to the facility but will not include street lighting. Use temporary meters
   to estimate utility consumption when feasible. Consumption estimates shall be effective 1
   Jan of each year.
5.5. Electricity and Natural Gas Estimating.
   5.5.1. Use the Energy Use Intensity (EUI) (kWh/sq ft-year or kBtu/sq ft-yr) information, if
   available. If not available, consider using similar EUIs on similar facilities. Account for
   weather, occupancy, and scheduling effects. Estimating includes:
       5.5.1.1. Inspecting motor nameplates.
       5.5.1.2. Determining what periods and loads the motors operate.
       5.5.1.3. Determining the amount and duration of electricity used for heating, air
       conditioning, lighting, and other loads.
   5.5.1.4. Estimates for heating and air conditioning may be made by using the methods
   specified in the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers
   (ASHRAE) Handbook.
5.6. Water and Wastewater Estimating. If possible, use temporary meters to estimate water
consumption; otherwise, use the best estimate possible based on the guidelines in the Federal
Water Use Indices (see the Air Force Water Conservation Guidebook,
AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                    37

EN-CE-A4-26&Filter=OO-EN-CE-A4 , and the following:
   5.6.1. 75 gallons per day per person residing in a mobile home.
   5.6.2. 150 gallons per day per person for facilities occupied on a 24-hour-per-day basis.
   5.6.3. 50 gallons per day per person for administrative or industrial facilities occupied on an
   8-hour-shift-per-day basis, plus any water needed for industrial or irrigation purposes.
   5.6.4. Estimate domestic sewage consumption by using 70 to 90 percent of the water
   consumption, depending on the amount of water needed for industrial or irrigation purposes.
   5.6.5. Estimate industrial wastewater flow for small users according to operational records,
   facility visits, and the observed flow during normal workload periods. Account for holiday,
   seasonal, and other unusual impacts in estimating the average flow for a small user.
   5.6.6. Estimate industrial wastewater flow for depot maintenance activity by subtracting the
   estimated flow for all non-depot maintenance contributors from the total flow measured at
   the industrial wastewater treatment plant. (Depot maintenance activities normally account
   for 80 percent to 98 percent of the flow.)
       5.6.6.1. Estimate average flows for all non-depot maintenance contributors, including
       activities required to reimburse and those not required to reimburse.
       5.6.6.2. Calculate the depot maintenance flow by subtracting the non-depot maintenance
       flows from the total flow measured at the industrial wastewater treatment plant.
       5.6.6.3. When enough data on total flows and depot maintenance's flows is available,
       calculate the average percentage of total flow attributed to depot maintenance. Use this
       total with monthly or quarterly total industrial wastewater treatment plant flows to
       determine the depot maintenance's flows for billing purposes.
5.7. Vending Machine Estimating. Estimate electrical utility consumption for vending
machines by using the consumption table Attachment 9.
5.8. Defense Utility Energy Reporting System (DUERS). DUERS is the information data
system that accounts for the costs and consumption of purchased utilities used by Department of
Defense (DoD) activities and is used for the annual energy reporting to Congress. DUERS data
shall be accurate. Data input is required no later than 45 days after the end of a billing period.
   5.8.1. DUERS data is used by the Air Staff to budget for future energy costs, to track energy
   goal progress, to validate energy efficiency projects, to analyze Air Force consumption
   trends, and most important, to develop long-term policy that ensures adequate and
   deliverable energy resources are available in support of the Air Force mission.
   5.8.2. DUERS includes utility consumption and building square footage data for all Air
   Force owned and leased facilities. This includes remote bases or sites assigned to, or
   supported by, the reporting (host) Air Force base.
   5.8.3. The host base and federal reimbursable customers may mutually agree to report utility
   consumption through their own command channels. However, data shall be coordinated
   between hosts and tenants to ensure that consumption, cost, and square footage data is
   reported under one agency and that duplicate reporting of data does not occur.

   5.8.4. Utility information for non-Air Force reimbursable customers shall not be included in
   DUERS. Please ensure the cost and consumption data for these customers is subtracted or
   excluded from the information added to DUERS.
   5.8.5. Effective January 2011, the Air Force Energy Reporting System (AFERS) will replace
   DUERS.

Terms
Annual Maximum Capacity—The annual maximum load capacity or transmission capacity
denotes the maximum amount of energy that can be transmitted through a system in a year. It is
the maximum capacity (kW, MW, BTU, gallons, cubic feet) multiplied by 525,600 minutes/year
or by 8,760 hours per year. For purchased utilities, it is the maximum demand specified in the
utility contract.
Base Rate—Non-industry-specific term referring to a fixed rate for a service or commodity.
Depending on the context, it can mean a fixed rate to which other charges may be added or
discounts applied, or a rate which remains fixed and unchangeable until the parties responsible
for setting the rate choose to change it.
Bundled Charges—When the utility contractor provides both the utility commodity and the
transmission/distribution service and the cost for the transmission/distribution service is
embedded in the commodity rate and not separately identified on the invoice.
Capital Investment, Capital Cost—Capital costs can include costs for land, taxes, surveying,
construction, inspection, materials, labor. The total capital costs are the original costs to the
government to construct/install the plant, distribution system, or collection system; any
additional upgrade, alteration or addition costs; and repair by replacement costs. The net repair
by replacement costs are reduced by the original construction costs of the portion replaced.
Connection Charge—A fee paid by a utility customer to cover the costs of connecting
household or commercial service to utility service lines.
Cost Of Service—Means the cost of providing a service. Cost-of-service pricing is the setting
of a price for a service based on the costs incurred in providing it. COS pricing can be applied to
an individual customer based on the costs of serving that customer (usually this is done only with
 44                                                           AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011


large-scale customers or customers who are costly to serve), or as an average cost of service for a
group of similar customers (also called a customer class or category).
Delivery Charge—A fee levied by an electric utility for the actual delivery of electricity to a
customer. The charge is applied to cover system reliability, emergency response and outage
recovery costs.
Delivery Service Charge—A charge included in an energy bill which is intended to cover the
cost of carrying energy from the transmission network or grid to the customer's location.
Distribution charges are usually based on energy use. Distribution charges are occasionally
broken up into separate charges, such as a charge for access to distribution systems and an
additional charge to cover customer service costs.
Demand Costs—Expenses that vary with the demand for energy. These include fixed costs for
production and transmission and some distribution costs.
Demand Ratchet—Demand ratchet is a means of applying a minimum charge to a customer
who may have inconsistent or seasonal energy requirements. For example, a ski resort may have
significant energy requirements for only six months of the year, but the utility may have to
maintain extra staff or equipment to make that energy available when the resort needs it. In
order to bill this customer fairly, a demand ratchet must be applied. The minimum monthly
demand charge will be calculated based on a given percentage of their peak use, for example
60% of their January billing, and the resort will be billed at least this much for every month of
the year, even if they use little or no energy during that month. This insures that the utility is
properly compensated for the year-round expenses it incurs to serve this customer.
Distribution System—Usually refers to the combination of the physical hardware required to
deliver the commodity to end-use customers and the procedures and processes used to perform
the actual delivery.
Energy Security—Air Force installation energy security is an assured, sustainable, and
sufficient energy supply. The defining characteristics are surety, sustainability, sufficiency, and
supply. Surety is reliable, available, and secure energy delivery. Sustainability is a survivable,
safe, operable, and maintainable infrastructure. Sufficiency provides the right level of energy
surety for the mission. Supply is an efficient, affordable, and diverse source of energy. (Note:
Draft definition in Air Force review as of 9/30/10, current valid definition applies when adopted)
Firm Service—The utility service/commodity is provided without interruption except in force
majeure situations such as war, strike, riot, force of nature, or other circumstance beyond the
control of parties.
Fixed Cost—A fixed cost is a production- or transmission-related expense which must be paid
regardless of whether the energy is produced or sold. Fixed costs can include capital costs, labor
and maintenance charges, taxes and demand charges among others.
Host—Tenant Support Agreement (HTSA)—A contract between the host unit and the tenant,
or other military service, that lists areas of support the host will provide to the tenant. AFPD 25-
2, Support Agreements, which outlines the Support Agreements Management System (SAMS),
will be used Air Force-wide to formally identify recurring support agreements based on specific
support functions, related responsibilities, and reimbursement cost. If you are a host unit with a
tenant unit on base, or a tenant unit yourself, you need to get familiar with this requirement
AFI32-1061 23 FEBRUARY 2011                                                                   45


Housing Privatization—The act of selling or the result of a sale of an on-base military family
housing area. The purchaser is a private contractor.
Incentive Rate—A discounted energy rate offered by utilities usually to encourage customers to
change usage patterns. The most common type of incentive rate offers discounts to customers
who reduce consumption during peak demand periods.
Incremental Cost—The cost of the next kilowatt-hour of generated energy, also referred to in
the industry as the next unit. Incremental costs change as production increases or decreases, but
these changes don’t always occur in a predictable pattern. As an example, incremental costs
typically decrease as production rises to comfortable capacity. But as that limit is reached,
incremental costs increase because additional costs (construction of new facilities, costs of
stressing production facilities, etc.) need to be factored into the cost of the next unit.
Interruptible Service—Service that can be reduced or completely stopped with little or no
notice. When interruptible energy is purchased, the purchaser voluntarily assumes the risk of
loss of access to that energy, which usually occurs only during peak demand periods or during
periods when market prices rise above the agreed-upon rate.
Interservice Support Agreements (ISSA)—Used to establish what material or services one
government agency has agreed to provide another government agency, and any remuneration, if
required, agreed upon between the government agencies. A DD-1149 and/or a Military
Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) are the most common ways of placing an obligation
against the ISSA. Governed by DoDI 4000.19, Inter Service and Intergovernmental Support
Kilowatt—Hour (kWh)—A quantitative measure of electric current flow equivalent to one
thousand watts being used continuously for a period on one hour; the unit most commonly used
to measure electrical energy, as opposed to kilowatt, which is simply a measure of available
power or demand.
Line Loss (Also Transmission Loss)—Energy lost or wasted in the transmission of energy from
the generator to the eventual customer.
Marginal Cost—The cost of providing an additional kilowatt-hour of energy output over and
above any energy currently being produced. The energy industry refers to the next kilowatt-hour
or next unit as the basis for determining this cost. Marginal costs only include immediate
expenses required to produce more energy. Long run marginal cost includes capital costs and
embedded costs which are not included in marginal costs.
Master Metering—A method of metering the use of a utility in which multiple buildings or
customers are all metered cumulatively on the same meter. For example, a condominium on
master metering would receive one energy bill for all condo owners measured through that
meter.
Maximum Capacity—The maximum power capacity (annual maximum capacity), normally
expressed in megawatts, that a given system or subsystem can carry or produce at a particular
moment, is typically used to represent the real production capability rating of a generation or
transmission system. The maximum flow capacity is measured in tons, gallons, cubic feet or
cubic meters, and indicates the maximum amount of gas or liquid that can be transported through
a pipeline at any particular moment.
Megawatt—Hour (MWh)—One thousand kilowatt-hours.

Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)—Memorandums that define general areas of conditional
agreement between two or more parties – what one party does depends on what the other party
does (e.g., one party agrees to provide support if the other party provides the materials).
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)—Memorandums that define general areas of
understanding between two or more parties – explains what each party plans to do; however,
what each party does is not dependent on what the other party does (e.g., requires reimbursement
or other support from receiver).
Minimum Monthly Charge—Any minimum charges of the supplier's rate schedule that become
payable if the government reduces its usage below the minimum or terminates the service.
Municipal Utility—When the utility provider for a given city or municipal region is owned by
the city or region itself, it is referred to as a municipal utility. Many municipal utilities are self-
regulating and not subject to independent state regulatory bodies. They can raise capital for
construction and maintenance using tax-exempt bond issues, set their own rate schedules and
policies provided they fall within state and federal regulations, and optionally choose how and
when they wish to regulate themselves. Municipal utilities can be directly owned by a
municipality or function as self-governing bodies organized as separate public corporations with
a degree of independence from the municipality.
Net Metering—An energy use metering scheme that can measure both energy consumed from a
utility and energy fed back to the utility by a customer capable of generating electricity. Net
metering regulations were intended to encourage the installation of solar generators, wind
turbines and other renewable energy and green power sources.
Peak Load, Peak Demand—These two terms are used interchangeably to denote the maximum
power requirement of a system at a given time, or the amount of power required to supply
customers at times when need is greatest. They can refer either to the load at a given moment
(e.g., a specific time of day) or to averaged load over a given period of time (e.g., a specific day
or hour of the day).
Ratchet Demand Clause—A term in a customer's contract or rate schedule (tariff) which
dictates that the customer's billings for each billing period must be based at least in part on the
maximum billing received by that customer over a given period, usually the preceding year.
Reimbursable Utilities—Transaction by which the Air Force receives funds from tenants or on-
base organizations for a utility service.
Tariff—A tax or levy system, or a document which outlines the conditions under which taxes
and levies can be charged. Tariffs are normally filed with governments or regulatory bodies and
approved by these same bodies. Tariffs typically list schedules for rates, contracts, and contract
and rate eligibility. When provided in printed or digital document Form, tariff documents may
include terms and conditions, sample forms, copies related legislation or regulations and other
related information. Tariffs are used in virtually all service industries. Tariff is widely
misinterpreted as referring to a tax or other Form of levied charge. A tariff merely sets out the
conditions for those charges; it does not represent the charge itself. Thus a tariff rate is a charged
rate as it is outlined in a tariff schedule.
Unbundled Services—Prior to deregulation of the US energy industry, energy customers were
provided with electrical service as an integrated package. After re-regulation, separate charges

for each facet of electrical supply and service are billed as a distinct line item charge on a
customer's invoice. Customers no longer pay for a group of services provided as a single
service. Instead they pay for a multitude of services (energy generation, transmission,
distribution, and perhaps many more depending on how energy is billed in a given region), all of
which are required for electrical service. When services are charged in this way they are referred
to as unbundled.
Utility Privatization (UP)—The act of selling or the result of a sale of an on-base utility
distribution system. The purchaser may be a private contractor or the local providing utility
company.
UP Incremental Rates—When the contractor’s charges for UP services are separate from and in
addition to the utility commodity charges.
Wheeling—When a utility or energy distribution company delivers, or wheels, energy from the
transmission system to an end-use customer, it is referred to as retail wheeling. When a customer
who also generates energy produces energy at one site, transports it across someone else's
facilities and consumes it at another site, it is referred to as self-service wheeling.

                       CONTENTS OF UTILITY SERVICE FOLDER

A3.1. Installations shall keep a utility service folder for each supplier providing utilities to the
installation. An organized folder for each purchased utility is necessary for quick access to
utility information. If there are multiple providers of similar utilities, keep a separate folder for
each provider but ensure the tracking and reporting of a utility type is reported as a single utility.
A 4-part folder works best for maintaining quick access. The folder has 6 sections that
correspond to each area listed below. Excess and older documents will be digitized (scanned,
faxed, or converted to PDF) where possible and stored and organized for similar easy access.
When data is electronic, provide information in the folder on the location or how to access
electronic files. Each utility service folder shall contain:
   A3.1.1. General Data
       A3.1.1.1. Customer account number(s).
       A3.1.1.2. A map showing the point(s) of delivery and master meter(s) to the installation.
   A3.1.2. Billing Data
       A3.1.2.1. Billings for the last 24 months.
       A3.1.2.2. Method of computing penalties, late fees, benefits, deductions, tariffs, fuel cost
       adjustments, standby charges, and other additional under the current rate schedule.
       A3.1.2.3. A calculated analysis of the latest proposed rates and charges to the
       installation, including the date, amount, and percent requested for supplier revenue.
       Include narrative description of impact of new rates on the installation.
   A3.1.3. Contract and Utility Provider Data
       A3.1.3.1. Memorandum documenting most recent annual utility contract review and a
       record of the action(s) taken to resolve problems or issues resulting from the annual
       review. Include recommendations for resolving these issues.
       A3.1.3.2. A copy of each the utility contract, including all contract modifications.
