1. PURPOSE: This instruction provides guidance for the deployment of Automated External
Defibrillators (AED) within buildings at Tyndall AFB. The AED is to be used for an emergency
response to Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) as a means to decrease premature mortality. This
instruction shall further identify and delineate the lines of responsibility and provide general
guidelines to ensure an appropriate response to initiate such a program.
 2                                                    TYNDALLAFBI40-101 1 MARCH 2011


2. SCOPE: This instruction describes the roles and responsibilities deemed necessary to ensure
the broadest training and application of the AED. The scope of training and use is applicable to
all federal employees and active duty personnel at Tyndall AFB.
3. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:
     3.1. 325th Fighter Wing Commander will:
        3.1.1. Have the overall responsibility for the PAD program. The 325 FW/CC designates

        objectives are maintained for the PAD program and determines the sites in which the
        AEDs are placed.
     3.2. Medical Group Commander (MDG/CC) will:
        3.2.1. Be responsible to the 325 FW/CC for implementation of the PAD program.
        The 325 MDG/CC will ensure all medical objectives are maintained and provide
        professional guidance on program administration.
        3.2.2. Appoint a physician Medical Director, who will typically be the Medical Group
        Chief of Medical Staff (SGH) unless wing leadership elects to use a Government
        Services Account vendor to manage PAD Program medical oversight.
        3.2.3. Appoint a Program Coordinator to oversee all AED training processes.
     3.3. Medical Director will:
        3.3.1. Be a physician proficient in emergency medical services protocols, basic life
        support (BLS), and the use of AEDs in accordance with the Federal Register 66 FR
        28495, Guidelines for Public Access Defibrillation Programs in Federal Facilities.
        3.3.2. Develop quality assurance guidelines for use of the AED and will review or have a
        designated representative review all event summary sheets within 5 days of AED use.
        3.3.3. Have direct medical oversight for the entire PAD Program and its participants.
     3.4. Program Coordinator will:
        3.4.1. As a minimum, be a BLS Instructor Trainer. The Program Coordinator will
        oversee all training processes for adult BLS in conjunction with AED training.
        3.4.2. Execute quarterly exercises with mock arrest to evaluate AED response.
        3.4.3. Serve as liaison to the Site Coordinator to ensure program compliance by annual
        Staff Assistance Visits to each AED site.

      required inspections and maintenance actions are accomplished in accordance with the
      manufacturer’s manual.
      3.6.2. Immediately complete the Tyndall AFB IMT 11, Events Summary Sheet (Atch 4),
      once an AED has been used in an emergency situation and forward along with the AED
      to the Medical Director or designee within 48 hours.
      3.6.3. Establish a process in local units for BLS responses and provide an annual briefing
      to staff about location and use of the AED.
   3.7. Targeted Responders will:
      3.7.1. As a minimum, be trained in BLS with AED use through the Program Coordinator
      at 325 MDG Education and Training. Initial training will be accomplished within 30
      days of receiving the AED, and refresher training will occur every 2 years thereafter.
      3.7.2. Train responders to follow the protocol in an emergency situation as taught in BLS
      class.
4. Purchase of New or Replacement AEDs.
   4.1. Requests for new or replacement AEDs must be approved by the 325 MDG/CC after
   being routed through the Life Support Function using an AF Form 601, Equipment Action
   Request. Once approval is granted, the unit may purchase the AED using a Government
   Wide Purchase Card. If the cost is over the simplified purchase card threshold and a waiver
   cannot be obtained, the unit will provide Medical Logistics with funds to purchase the AEDs.
   Units must purchase only AEDs that have been standardized by the 325 MDG. Once the
   AED is received, and prior to its use, the unit is required to bring it to Medical Logistics for
   initial inspection. Additionally, Medical Logistics will maintain the AED on equipment
   records for quality assurance and maintenance purposes. The unit is required to maintain
   accountability for the AED on their base supply account IAW AFI 41-209, Medical Logistics
   Support.
5. Maintenance:
   5.1. 325 MDG Medical Equipment Repair (325 MDSS/SGSLM) will serve as the point of
   contact for Site Coordinators and the manufacturer representatives concerning any problems
   with AEDs.
      5.1.1. Medical Equipment Repair will be responsible for any inspections or maintenance
      beyond the Site Coordinator’s ability to accomplish using the manufacturer owner’s
      manual.
6. Quality Assurance:
   6.1. The Medical Director or designee will review all event summary sheets and event data
   downloaded from the AED to assess quality of care in accordance with Federal statutes.
      6.1.1. The 325 MDG Life Support Function will review all event summary sheets to
      ensure standard of care has been met.
7. AED LOCATION AND INSTALLATION:
 4                                                    TYNDALLAFBI40-101 1 MARCH 2011


     7.1. The essential key to surviving a heart attack is early defibrillation. Therefore, AEDs
     must be strategically placed throughout the organization to minimize the time from cardiac
     arrest to the time of initial shock in a victim of Sudden Cardiac Arrest.
        7.1.1. A facility site assessment should be accomplished to determine the number of
        AEDs that are necessary, as well as their placement within a building.
        7.1.2. Factors to consider in determining AED placement include the following:
            7.1.2.1. Facility size.
            7.1.2.2. Number of employees in the facility.
            7.1.2.3. Number of people that may have public access to the facility on a daily basis.
            7.1.2.4. Average age of employees and those who frequent the facility.
            7.1.2.5. Incidence of heart disease given the population at hand.
     7.2. AED accessory kits should be packed with the AED so that the responder will not lose
     time deciding what to take to the emergency. These kits should provide items such as gloves,
     scissors, razor, tape, extra electrodes, and a barrier mask.
     7.3. AEDs should be stored in such a way that tampering will be evident when the unit is
     removed for use. This can be set up as a central alarm, whereby the local EMS is
     automatically notified, or as a local sounding alarm that can draw assistance to the scene.
