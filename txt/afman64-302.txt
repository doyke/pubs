                                   NAF REQUIREMENTS

2.1. AF NAF Policy. NAF procurements shall be accomplished by trained procurement
personnel in a fair, equitable and impartial manner, and in the best interest of the NAFI. NAF or
Appropriated Fund (APF) personnel may procure NAF requirements. NAF procurements shall
use competitive negotiation procedures to the maximum extent practicable. Offers shall be
solicited from a reasonable number of sources except when non-competitive procurement is
justified. NAF contracts shall be awarded to responsible offerors and to offerors who offer the
best value to the NAFI. NAF contracts will not be awarded to entities on the ―List of Parties
Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs.‖ Existing NAF and APF
contracts and agreements shall be used to satisfy NAF requirements when available, cost
effective, and meet the needs of the requiring activity. NAFIs shall authorize other DoD NAFI
organizations to place delivery orders against their contracts to the maximum extent possible.
Procurement methods and procedures that result in firm fixed-price contracts are preferred;
however, price adjustment provisions may be used when the Contracting Officer determines it is
in the best interest of the NAFI. In executing NAF procurements, Contracting Officers shall
comply with the requirements of applicable statutes, regulations, or directives. Each NAF
contract shall:
   2.1.1. Contain clauses governing: changes, examinations of records, dispute resolutions, and
   terminations. Required NAF Contracting Clauses/Provisions are located in the NAF
   electronic purchasing system and can also be found at http://www.afnafpo.com.
   2.1.2. Apply the Buy American Act and Trade Agreements Act to the procurement of non-
   resale supplies and equipment.
2.2. Waivers to NAF Procedures. Field activity waivers to NAF procedures must be obtained
from AFNAFPO. AFNAFPO requests for waivers to NAF procedures set forth in this manual
must be approved by SAF/AQC.
2.3. Master Library. Each NAF purchasing operation shall have available, either via hard copy
or electronically, a complete set of the Commander’s Smart Buy Program (CSBP) catalogs. NAF
purchasing personnel are responsible for ensuring that the appropriate activity managers have
access to these catalogs.
2.4. Review Meetings. The head of the installation Services function (e.g., squadron
commander, director, or equivalent) will meet at least annually or more frequently, if desired,
with operating personnel to identify ways and means of improving NAF contracting procedures
and to review the CSBP and purchasing reports generated through the NAF electronic
purchasing system. Minutes of the meeting should be taken, distributed to all attendees and
activity managers, and kept on file.
2.5. NAF Purchasing Training. Personnel delegated purchasing duties must receive formal
training from the delegating authority. NAF P-Card cardholders will receive training by the
issuing authority. The RM will maintain records of such training. The RM will ensure NAF
purchases are made in accordance with current directives and guidance.
AFMAN64-302 16 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                     11

individuals named in the Consolidated List of Debarred, Suspended, and Ineligible Contractors
are not solicited for offers or quotations or awarded contracts. Information on parties excluded

contract disputes, novation agreements, contract claims, changes to NAF contract templates, and
ratifications (see paragraph 12.7), deviations or any other legal issue at the discretion of the CO.
Legal advice should be obtained from the servicing SJA Office or Contract Attorney. If the
servicing SJA requires additional guidance/direction on a NAF contracting issue, they should
contact the HQ Air Force Administrative Law Directorate, Services Law Division (HQ AF/JAA-
S). The Air Force General Counsel (SAF/GCQ) will advise SAF/AQC on all matters regarding
their authority as outlined in DoDD 4105.67, DoDI 4105.71 and this manual.
2.8. Team Approach. A successful NAF procurement requires a team approach. The team is
composed of key stakeholders, and each has a vital role to play in the procurement process. The
team, at a minimum, consists of the requiring activity, finance, the Contracting Officer, and the
individual responsible for receiving the end-item, or service. Although the team supports the
various members, individuals possess the expertise to complete their area of responsibility.
When the separation of duties is not practicable, the circumstances must be clearly documented
in the NAF electronic purchasing system. The roles and responsibilities include:
   2.8.1. Requiring Activity:

  AFNAFPO will also provide a written report within a couple of weeks. The intent of the on-
  site SAV program is to provide guidance and assistance to installation NAF activities and
  provide recommendations for improving their purchasing program.
  3.13.2. NAF Electronic Purchasing System Reviews. AFNAFPO will periodically conduct
  installation-level reviews of contracts and other documentation loaded in IBPS. This type of
  review is a less formal review than the on-site SAV; however, the main purpose is the same
  to assist the base by identifying specific problem areas and offering recommendations for
  improvement. No formal report is provided to the base with this review.

   NAF PURCHASING PROCEDURES USING THE COMMANDER’S SMART BUY
                        PROGRAM (CSBP)

4.1. Central Purchasing Requirements. Essential Products Program (EPP) contracts are
mandatory. Requests for waivers to an EPP contract shall be submitted in writing to AFNAFPO.
Nonappropriated Fund Purchasing Agreements (NPAs) shall be used as primary sources of
supply for other requirements.
4.2. Selection of Essential Products Program (EPP) Sources. Selection of a contractor for
this program may be determined by competitive solicitations or by an internal selection process
(by an evaluation panel) from current NPA holders. When a selection is made from an NPA
source, a written determination shall be included in the contract file supporting best value to the
Air Force NAFI. The operational director or designee and the contracting director or designee
are required to sign this supporting document.
4.3. Interior Design Projects. Interior design projects change the design of a room or building.
Interior design projects are purchased through AFNAFPO. A requirement is considered an
interior design project when a minimum of three elements of a room are changed (e.g., carpeting,
draperies, lighting, wall art, furniture). Interior design projects and furniture requirements that
involve Customer’s Own Material (COM) will be forwarded to AFNAFPO for purchase.
4.4. Trade Shows. This program presents an opportunity each year for installation level
managers to receive direct support from AFNAFPO while attending various trade shows.
Working in concert with our NPA holders, special discounts are offered during these shows that
are ordinarily not offered during any other time of the year. AFNAFPO may support the
following Trade Shows: Professional Golfers Association (PGA) Show; Hospitality Design
Expo & Conference; National Restaurant Association (NRA) Show; Bowl Expo; and the
International Hotel/Motel & Restaurant (IH/M&R) Show.
4.5. Consolidated Buys. Consolidated buys create an opportunity for Services operations
worldwide to participate in unique purchasing opportunities by consolidating common
requirements under one order issued by AFNAFPO. Consolidated buys focus on generating
volume to create additional discounts from the NPA pricing program. Golf carts, skiing
equipment, party kits, computers, and televisions are a few examples of bulk purchases being
made under the consolidated buy initiative.
4.6. Product Bulletins. This program works very successfully for our NPA contractors who
want to market their programs aggressively to our customer base. The AFNAFPO works with
our trading partners to promote and market various products in their product line. It is a
simplified process distributed via product bulletin format announcing pricing specials, closeouts,
new products, and various other applications that complement our trading partners' annual
marketing strategy. In addition to distributing these bulletins to our worldwide Services
customers, the AFNAFPO posts these special buying opportunities on the AFNAFPO website.

                       SERVICING CONTRACTING OFFICE (SCO)

5.1. Contracting Support. The SCO will use the guidance and procedures of this manual as the
method of contracting in support of local NAF requirements to the fullest extent possible. When
FAR clauses are used in NAF contracts, the Contracting Officer will delete references to
―Government‖ and substitute ―NAFI‖. The SCO will provide contracting support for the
following:
   5.1.1. Purchases using NAFs and APFs. For purchases using both NAFs and APFs, the
   acquisition will use FAR procedures.
   5.1.2. Service contracts that exceed NAF Contracting Officer purchasing authority.
   5.1.3. Construction contracts that exceed NAF Contracting Officer purchasing authority.
   5.1.4. NAF requirements placed against APF indefinite-delivery contracts.
   5.1.5. Special requests for contracting support or technical assistance.
5.2. Appropriated Fund Purchases. Delivery orders citing APFs cannot be issued against
NAF Contracts and Agreements. However, the Contracting Officer may use a NAF Contract or
Agreement holder as a source for APF requirements.
5.3. Repair of Aero Club Aircraft. The SCO will obtain at least two repair cost estimates for
aircraft repair from Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) licensed aircraft repair firms. The
solicitation will advise offerors that no award will be made if it is determined the aircraft is not
economical to repair or if a decision is made to accomplish repairs in-house. The SCO will
provide the repair estimates, including price and terms or conditions, to the local aero club
manager. The manager submits the estimates and required photographs of the damage to the HQ
AFSVA, Directorate of Programs for repair authorization.

                                            Chapter 6

                              SPECIAL NAF REQUIREMENTS

6.1. NAF Contracting Requirements. The FAR, DoD supplements (DFARS), and Air Force
FAR supplements (AFFARS) do not apply to NAF procurement. Only those clauses required by
law or otherwise stated in this manual shall be mandatory. FAR procedures may be used as
guidance in support of NAF purchasing processes.
6.2. Construction Contracts. Construction contracts awarded by AFNAFPO may use the FAR
as a guideline. However, the process for acquiring construction may be based upon standard
commercial practices if such practices are in the best interest of the NAFI. Such commercial
standards may include a total turnkey service, including construction with the same firm that
provided the A&E design. Construction requirements shall not be split to circumvent dollar
limitations set forth in Chapter 3. Government or NAFI furnished supplies and equipment is not
included when determining the contract value. Coordinate construction services with the Base
Civil Engineer (BCE) prior to issuing a purchase order. When necessary, make arrangements for
BCE inspectors to inspect and accept the work.
6.3. Purchase Orders/Contracts. Unilateral purchase orders (except for resale) shall not
exceed the SAT. The Contracting Officer shall issue bilateral purchase orders or formal
contracts for requirements exceeding the SAT or where otherwise determined appropriate.
Purchase orders for resale items may be issued for any amount.
6.4. Sources of Supply. Before considering open market commercial suppliers, Contracting
Officers shall consider the following sources in the following order of precedence: (1) EPP
contracts, (2) NPAs, (3) General Services Administration (GSA) contracts. Contracting Officers
will also consider other sources of supply described in paragraphs 6.12 and 6.13 of this manual.
6.5. Buying Products Containing Recovered Materials. Where procuring cumulatively more
than $10,000.00 of certain products not for resale that can contain recovered materials, activities
should      consult       the      Environmental         Protection      Agency       list       at
http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/conserve/tools/cpg/products/index.htm and 40 CFR 247.3. Such
products must be procured where they meet our performance standards, are competitively and
reasonably available, and not unreasonably priced.
6.6. Competition Requirements.
   6.6.1. The Contracting Officer must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable
   to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the
   NAFI, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. For purchases up to and including
   $5,000, maximum practicable competition ordinarily can be obtained by soliciting quotes or
   offers from sources within the local area. When Contracting Officers cannot make a
   determination of price reasonableness, quotes must be obtained from at least two offerors.
   Price reasonableness addresses the issue of whether the offered price is too high and may be
   determined based on one or more of the following considerations: market research,
   comparison with previous competitive purchase of same or similar item, current
   catalog/published price list/advertisement, buyer’s personal knowledge of item. The
   Contracting Officer’s signature constitutes certification that prices are fair and reasonable.
   Contracting Officers shall not engage in the practice of auctioning one company’s bid against
AFMAN64-302 16 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   21


   another company’s bid in an attempt to obtain a lower price. Contracting Officers will
   determine price fair and reasonableness on all purchases when required and document the
   determination in the contract file and attach it in the NAF electronic purchasing system. (See
   chapter 9 for limitations concerning the use of the NAF P-Card.)
   6.6.2. Purchases exceeding $5,000. At least two sources shall be solicited for requirements
   estimated over $5,000 and up to and including the SAT amount. When possible, written or
   electronic solicitations will be issued to a minimum of three qualified sources when
   practicable for requirements exceeding the SAT. If only one bid is received then the
   Contracting Officer shall include a written memorandum outlining the basis of price
   reasonableness.
6.7. Resale/Rental (Open Market). Competition is not mandatory for resale or rental items.
When competition is not obtained the Contracting Officer will prepare a determination of price
reasonableness and include the determination in the contract file and attach it in the NAF
electronic purchasing system.
   6.7.1. Food purchases under resale. Standard commercial practices concerning the purchase
   of food items apply to NAF purchasing. Branding is a commonly accepted concept in food
   services. Brand name food items may be purchased without further competition and
   established as standard presentations (e.g., core menus and core recipes) within food
   operations. Food items in general (whether they are directly provided to the consumer or they
   are part of the recipe) may be considered items for resale; however, competition may be in
   the best interest of the NAFI in certain cases. Price reasonableness must be determined when
   purchases are made outside the NAF Prime Vendor program.
   6.7.2. Rental item purchases without competition. The decision to purchase brand name
   items for rental without competition is made by the Contracting Officer in coordination with
   the requesting activity. Contracting Officers are required to seek competition for rental items
   not driven by brand name preference only if it is in the best interest of the NAFI.
   6.7.3. Items that generate revenues by virtue of their function, such as amusement machines,
   vending machines, and bingo prizes may be purchased without competition. When
   competition is not obtained, the Contracting Officer will determine price reasonableness and
   include this determination in the contract file and attach it in the NAF electronic purchasing
   system.
6.8. Brand Name and Sole Source. Brand Name is used when only one particular
manufacturer’s product, and not a substitution or equivalent, meets the essential requirements of
the NAFI. Requirements are generally based on customer preference and/or demand. Sole
Source implies that there is only one person or company that can provide the contractual services
needed and that any attempt to obtain bids would only result in one person or company being
available to meet the need. Written justification for brand name and sole source purchases shall
be provided by the requesting activity along with the purchase request. The justification must
state what specific or unusual need makes the required brand name product(s)/sole source
necessary. Personal preference is not sufficient justification for a sole source purchase. The
Contracting Officer will determine whether there is sufficient justification to purchase the brand
name or from the sole source. A brand name only purchase may be competed to determine if the
item can be procured at various discounts from the manufacturer or from authorized distributors.
Sole source requests may be validated by publicizing the requirement. When competition is not
 22                                                      AFMAN64-302 16 NOVEMBER 2011


obtained the Contracting Officer will determine price reasonableness and include the
determination in the contracting file.
6.9. Brand Name or Equal. The brand name or equal method is another procedure for
describing a requirement. The purchase description should set forth those salient characteristics
of the brand name product that are essential to the needs of the NAFI. The make or model
number or other appropriate nomenclature and all other known acceptable brand name products,
should be listed as a part of the description. The Contracting Officer shall require the offerors to
submit information that establishes that the product offered meets the NAFI requirement. Brand
name or equal procurements are not accomplished on a sole-source basis. Therefore, no
justification or approval is required other than documentation in the file showing that
competition was sought, and a determination of fair and reasonable pricing was made, with
subsequent award of the contract.
6.10. Determination of Responsibility. Before award of any contract, the Contracting Officer
must determine the responsibility of the firm that is being considered for award. Contracting
Officers may use the standards in FAR 9.104-1 as a guide in determining contractor
responsibility. To be determined responsible, a prospective contractor must demonstrate they:
   6.10.1. Have adequate financial resources to perform the contract, or the ability to obtain
   them;
   6.10.2. Are able to comply with the required or proposed delivery or performance schedule;
   6.10.3. Have a satisfactory performance record;
   6.10.4. Have a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics;
   6.10.5. Have the necessary organization, experience, accounting and operational controls,
   and technical skills, or the ability to obtain them; and
   6.10.6. Have the necessary production, construction, and technical equipment and facilities,
   or the ability to obtain them.
6.11. Design Inclusion Provision. A firm that designs or specifies projects (or its subsidiaries
or affiliates) generally may not have to compete for a contract to provide items for that project if
the Contracting Officer determines that it meets the business objectives of the requesting activity
and is in the best interest of the NAFI.
6.12. Performance Period of NAF Contracts or Agreements. Contracts subject to the Service
Contract Act (SCA) are restricted to 5 years. Maximum time for contracts not subject to the SCA
will be determined by the Contracting Officer. Contracts that exceed 10 years must be supported
by the Contracting Officer’s determination that demonstrates the extended performance is in the
best interest of the NAFI. Contracts for leases of real property are unlimited. Blanket Purchase
Agreements (BPAs) and Nonappropriated Fund Purchase Agreements (NPAs) must state the
beginning and ending dates of the basic period. BPAs and NPAs may include option periods to
extend their duration; however, they will not exceed ten years.
6.13. Buying Products and Services from the Blind and Disabled. The Javits-Wagner-O’Day
Act requires the Government to purchase supplies or services from the mandatory AbilityOne
―Procurement List‖ if the supplies or services are available within the period required. The
―Procurement List‖ is located at the AbilityOne website at https://www.abilityone.org.
AFMAN64-302 16 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                    23


6.14. Buying from Federal Prison Industries (FPI) Inc. (FPI), also referred to as UNICOR, is
a self-supporting, wholly owned Government corporation. Contracting Officers are encouraged
to purchase FPI supplies and services to the maximum extent practicable. FPI supplies and
services are located at www.unicor.gov.
6.15. Purchase of Hazardous Materials. Orders or contracts which include the purchase of
hazardous materials shall include the FAR clause 52.223-3, Hazardous Material Safety Data, by
reference or in full text. Orders shall identify where safety hazardous sheets should be submitted.
All purchases of hazardous material must be coordinated in advance with the Hazardous
Materials Pharmacy (see AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Materials Management).
6.16. Controlled Medical Substances. Controlled medical substances purchased for the base
veterinarian shall include the veterinarian’s Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) number. If the
veterinarian does not have a DEA number (digital certificate), he or she shall order medical
substances from base medical supply.
6.17. Information Technology Coordination. All AFNAFPO contracts for Automated
Information Systems (AISs), and Information Technology (IT) equipment and services must be
coordinated through the Air Force Personnel Operations Agency, AFPOA, prior to award.
MAJCOM/installation-level contracts for AIS and IT should be coordinated with the supporting
Communications Directorate or Communications Squadron to ensure compliance with Air Force
IT criteria and standards.
6.18. NAF Vehicles. All NAF vehicles must be purchased by AFNAFPO unless a waiver has
been granted by AFNAFPO for local purchase.

                                          Chapter 7

                                PURCHASE REQUEST (PR)

7.1. PR Guidance. Purchase requests shall as a minimum identify the requesting NAFI (e.g.,
Randolph AFB Morale Welfare & Recreation (MWR) fund), the requirement, and requested
delivery date. PRs for services should be submitted with a performance work statement (PWS) or
statement of work (SOW).
7.2. Numbering PRs. Numbering of PRs should be configured to identify base name, branch of
service, cost center code, fiscal year, and four unique numbers that identify the particular PR.
The PR numbers will be compatible with NAF electronic purchasing system. Cost center codes
and NAF identifications are provided in the NAF Financial Management and Accounting
regulation (AFMAN 34-214, Procedures for Nonappropriated Funds Financial Management
and Accounting).
   7.2.1. Purchase Request Register. A register for purchase requests and resulting purchase
   orders is maintained electronically in the NAF electronic purchasing system. If the electronic
   purchasing system is not available, a manual register must be maintained until the system
   becomes available and is updated with the information.
   7.2.2. Funds Availability. All purchase requests must contain certification of funds
   availability (signed by an individual with fund certification authority) before purchasing
   action is initiated.
   7.2.3. Distribution of Purchase Requests. The preferred method of distribution is through the
   NAF electronic purchasing system.
7.3. Green Procurement. All purchase requests for non-resale products or services must define
requirements that comply with the Green Procurement Program. Training on green procurement
is available at Defense Acquisition University.
7.4. Authorization of Additional Funds against Original PRs. Any contracting action that
requires more funds than originally authorized cannot be executed without certification that
funds are available. Additional NAFs are obtained by the Contracting Officer before
commitment of NAFs to settle claims. Freight and other miscellaneous costs not included in the
resulting order/contract are not considered part of the funding estimates submitted on the PR.
Additional funds may be cited by way of an additional PR. Verbal confirmation is authorized and
will be documented in the NAF electronic purchasing system for additional funding that does not
exceed $500.
AFMAN64-302 16 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                     25


                                            Chapter 8

                               SOLICITATIONS AND AWARD

8.1. Solicitations. Contracting Officers will provide identical information to all prospective
offerors in the bidding process. Written solicitations may be structured as a request for quotation
(RFQ) or a request for proposal (RFP). RFQs may be oral and the responses to RFQs are not
binding on the offeror. An RFP will be issued when a binding offer is needed and will bear the
signature or electronic certification of an official in the company authorized to commit the firm.
The offer will become a binding contract when accepted and signed by the Contracting Officer.
Solicitations may be transmitted and received electronically and have the same binding effect as
a written solicitation. The NAF electronic purchasing system, which is located at
http://www.afnafpo.com/ will provide necessary formats to forward to prospective offerors
electronically or manually.
   8.1.1. Over the SAT. Written solicitations will be used for open market purchases exceeding
   the SAT.
   8.1.2. Change in NAFI requirements. If there are changes in the requirement before or after
   receipt of quotations or proposals, the Contracting Officer will notify offerors of the change.
   If the quotations or proposals are not yet due, an amendment will be sent to all firms that
   received the solicitation. If the deadline for quotations or proposals has passed, send the
   amendment only to those firms that responded. The Contracting Officer will make a written
   determination if the changes are significant enough to warrant canceling the entire
   solicitation and resoliciting.
8.2. Source Selection. Solicitations for requirements exceeding the SAT may require written
proposals (ordinarily using AF Forms 2640 and 2641, Nonappropriated Fund Contract
Award) or electronic proposals, and may include oral presentations by prospective contractors.
Contract award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the NAFI.
The source selection approach and evaluation factors are specific to each acquisition and shall be
identified in the solicitation. Where appropriate, an acquisition strategy is developed prior to the
drafting of the solicitation to determine the most effective source selection approach for the
requirement, to establish evaluation criteria, to identify the source selection evaluation team
evaluating proposals, and develop the documents to support the Source Selection Authority
(SSA) decision. Solicitations shall inform offerors of the format required for the submission of a
proposal and will elicit from offerors only the material needed to fairly evaluate offers. Past
performance shall be an evaluation factor. Poor past performance ratings may disqualify an
offeror from receiving an award. Offerors are required to meet all solicitation requirements, such
as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in
addition to those identified as evaluation factors or subfactors. Failure to meet a requirement
may result in an offer being ineligible for award. Non-disclosure agreements shall be used
during the source selection process. The Director of AF NAF Purchasing, or designee, is the
SSA for contracts estimated to exceed the SAT. The SSA is responsible for the proper and
efficient conduct of the entire source selection process encompassing proposal solicitation,
evaluation, selection, and contract award.
 26                                                      AFMAN64-302 16 NOVEMBER 2011


8.3. Synopsis. Synopsis is not a requirement for NAF purchases. However, the Contracting
Officer may synopsize requirements when it is determined to be in the best interest of the NAFI.
If synopsis is deemed appropriate, the Contracting Officer will use the Government-wide Point
of Entry system and will determine the length of time for publicizing NAF requirements.
Solicitation and contract award notices for synopsized NAF purchases shall include the
following as the last part of the notice to be published: ―This is a nonappropriated fund purchase
and it does not obligate appropriated funds of the United States Government. Nonappropriated
funds are generated by the military community through the sale of goods and services and the
collection of fees and charges for participation in military community programs. This purchase
does not involve federal tax dollars.‖ Contract award notices are not a mandatory requirement for
NAF purchases. However, AFNAFPO will send written notification to all unsuccessful offerors
that outlines their debriefing rights.
8.4. Pricing Summaries and Price Negotiation Memorandums (PNM). After the receipt of
offers, the Contracting Officer may make an award based on the initial quotations/proposals, or
conduct negotiations. The Contracting Officer will ensure that discussions, if held, are conducted
openly and fairly without affording any offeror a competitive advantage and that the discussions
are documented in the PNM. A PNM or pricing summary will be prepared to document the price
analysis and to establish the fairness and reasonableness of the proposed pricing. When price
reasonableness is based upon adequate competition (two or more technically acceptable offers),
no further supporting documentation is required. When only one offer is received or found to be
technically acceptable, the file will include catalog references, price lists, previous prices for
similar goods or services, a brief statement of facts regarding the anticipation of competition, or
other documents that support the reasonableness of the offered price.
8.5. Award. If factors other than price alone are used as a basis of award, then these factors
shall be identified in the solicitation with their order of importance in selecting an offer for
award.
   8.5.1. Purchases up to and including the SAT. Using price and other factors as the basis of
   award, the Contracting Officer will document the file with the rationale for making award to
   a particular contractor.
   8.5.2. Purchases over the SAT. Using price and other factors as the basis of award, the
   Contracting Officer will prepare a written summary of the analysis of all offers showing the
   results of the evaluation in relation to price, technical factors, and past performance (when it
   is used as part of the evaluation criteria). This document will be marked ―Source Selection
   Sensitive‖ and will not be released to the public.
8.6. Purchase Orders (PO). POs are offers to buy items on the open market at specified prices
and other terms and conditions. POs are binding when the firm accepts the offer either by signing
the order or initiating performance. Use the template provided in the NAF electronic purchasing
system. If automated ordering is not available, then the AF Form 2209, Nonappropriated Fund
Order for Supplies or Services, will be used. Commercial vendor literature, business
agreements and licenses may be attached as part of the order; however, commercial business
agreements shall be reviewed by the local SJA/Contract Attorney prior to including them in any
order or contract. The NAF General Provisions will be added to open market purchase orders.
8.7. Confirmation Orders. Orders may be issued orally with follow-on written orders
confirming the oral requirements. The written order will contain the date and individual with
AFMAN64-302 16 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                     27


whom the verbal order was placed. Confirmation Orders should be used only in an emergency
situation.
8.8. POs Outside the United States. In the event of inconsistency in the translation between
terms of a contract written outside the United States, the English definition shall take precedence.
8.9. Delivery Orders (DO). A DO is an order written against an existing contract or agreement.
Terms and conditions set forth in the basic contract will apply to delivery orders issued.
8.10. Numbering of Contracts/Orders. The numbering system shall be consistent with the
NAF electronic purchasing system to provide an audit trail of contracts/orders issued against
individual purchase requests. Contracts or Orders issued by the SCO will be consistent with the
SCO numbering system.
8.11. Equal Low Quotes or Proposals. Negotiation with responsible offerors should be used to
break a tie. After further negotiations, if there is still a tie, award shall be made by a drawing
witnessed by a minimum of two individuals. Offerors may be invited to attend the drawing.
Document the contract file with the names and addresses of persons witnessing the drawing.
8.12. Debriefings. An offeror who desires a post-award debriefing must make a written request
to the Contracting Officer within 3 days after the date on which that offeror received notice of
the contract award. When determined appropriate by the Contracting Officer, the requesting
offeror will be debriefed promptly and furnished the basis for the selection decision and contract
award. The debriefing shall not include point-by-point comparisons of the debriefed offeror’s
proposal with those of other offerors and is not a forum for debate regarding the subjective
judgment of the SSA and shall not reveal any information exempt from release under the
Freedom of Information Act or other applicable law or regulation. At a minimum, the debriefing
information should include:
   8.12.1. The Government’s evaluation of the significant weaknesses or deficiencies in the
   offeror’s proposal, if applicable
   8.12.2. The overall evaluated cost or price (including unit prices), and technical rating, if
   applicable, of the successful offeror and the debriefed offeror, and past performance
   information on the debriefed offeror;
   8.12.3. The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency
   during the source selection;
   8.12.4. A summary of the rationale for award;
   8.12.5. For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered
   by the successful offeror;
   8.12.6. Reasonable responses to relevant questions about whether source selection
   procedures contained in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable
   authorities were followed.
8.13. Clauses and Certifications. Contracts, orders, and agreements funded exclusively with
NAFs shall contain only those clauses and certifications required for the purpose of complying
with Federal law, DoD requirements, and protecting the interests of the NAFI. The NAF

minimum clauses and certifications. Commercial literature, business agreements and licenses
may be incorporated as part of NAF contracts and orders providing they do not conflict with a
federal requirement or immunity. Legal review shall be obtained when any of the
aforementioned documents are incorporated into NAF contracts.
8.14. Payment Terms. Payment terms shall be specified on orders/contracts. The Contracting

                            NAF PURCHASE CARD (P-CARD)

9.1. Introduction. The NAF P-Card is used to make purchases for official government use. The
purchasing thresholds for the card are determined by AFNAFPO in coordination with the HQ
AFSVA, Directorate of Financial Management and Comptroller. The NAF P-Card is the
preferred method of acquiring standard commercial items within the dollar thresholds set forth in
this manual.
9.2. Functions and Responsibilities. At installation-level, the local RM is the Installation
Program Coordinator (IPC) for the services activities in the Services/FSS and serves as the focal
point for coordinating the issuance and destruction of cards, establishment of reports and
administrative training. The RM oversees the NAF P-Card Program and establishes installation
level guidelines. The RM outlines authority of cardholders by issuing letters designating
authority and appointing cardholders. Prior to receiving a NAF P-Card, cardholders receive a
letter of appointment outlining responsibilities and indicating the maximum amount for each
purchase. The nonappropriated fund financial analyst (NAFFA) shall perform an annual review
of all cardholder accounts and document the results of their findings IAW AFI 65-107,
Nonappropriated Funds Financial Management Oversight Responsibilities. At MAJCOM level,
the MAJCOM/A1SR serves as the IPC, and at HQ AFSVA, the AFNAFPO has overall
management of the NAF P-Card program.
9.3. Training. Training is managed by the IPC. Training should address policies and
procedures pertaining to small purchases, the use of the NAF P-Card and ethical standards. The
training may be conducted by NAF Contracting Officers, senior procurement personnel, or the
RM. All cardholders shall be familiar with the requirements of this manual and other instructions
pertaining to the NAF P-Card Program and NAF P-Card Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)
developed by the Air Force Services Agency.
9.4. Dollar Limitations/Restrictions. The RM is responsible for overseeing the execution of
purchasing transactions to ensure they do not exceed the individual cardholder’s dollar
limitations and that the card is being used only for authorized government transactions. The
limitations set at installation and MAJCOM level must not exceed the overall thresholds
established through AFNAFPO (i.e., each installation or MAJCOM may set its own thresholds as
long as they do not exceed the dollar amounts set forth in this manual).
   9.4.1. The NAF P-Card card may be used to purchase supplies, equipment, and non-personal
   services. Individual transactions may not exceed $2,500 except as follows:
       9.4.1.1. For purchases from the Commissary, the Army and Air Force Exchange Service
       (AAFES), Naval Exchange Service (NEX), Prime Vendor, and printing services from the
       Defense Automated Printing Service (DAPS) the limit is $25,000 per transaction.
       9.4.1.2. Cardholder accounts may be established by training and education program
       managers with a single purchase limit up to $25,000. The NAF P-Card does not replace
       the DD Form 1556, Request, Authorization Agreement, Certification of Training and
       Reimbursement.

  9.4.2. NAF Contracting Officers may specify the NAF P-Card as a method of payment on
  agreements, purchase and delivery orders, and contracts up to the limit of their warrant
  authority. The Contracting Officer can specify any NAF P-Card cardholder at their
  installation, except themselves, as the payer. Card limits shall be adjusted by the local card
  approving authority to meet mission needs and maximize use of the NAF P-card.
  9.4.3. The NAF P-Card shall not be used for the following:
     9.4.3.1. Personal Purchases.
     9.4.3.2. Use as a travel card for official government travel.
     9.4.3.3. Cash Advances.
     9.4.3.4. Rental or lease of land or buildings.
     9.4.3.5. Purchase of hazardous/dangerous items such as explosives, toxins.
     EXCEPTION: The purchase of ammunition and firearms used for resale in Rod & Gun
     Clubs or on skeet ranges is authorized if proper purchase authorization is obtained from
     applicable base, local, state and/or federal agencies.
     9.4.3.6. Items designated for purchase with APFs.

BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS (BPAS) AND BLANKET DELIVERY ORDERS
                           (BDOS)

10.1. BPAs. BPAs provide a method of purchasing supplies and services on a recurring basis on
the open market when the use of the NAF P-Card card is not practicable. NAF Contracting
Officers negotiate BPAs. A PR is not required to create a BPA. BPAs will be accomplished by
using the templates provided in Internet Based Purchasing System(IBPS) and will include the
NAF General Provisions. NAF Special Provisions will also be added on BPAs for perishable
items. BPA numbering will be compatible with the NAF electronic purchasing system. If the
BPA is accomplished manually, then the agreement shall contain as a minimum: pricing,
identification of items covered, delivery terms, Contracting Officer’s signature, dollar call
limitations, individuals or positions authorized to place calls against the BPA, and mandatory
clauses identified in this manual, i.e., NAF General Provisions and Special Provisions.
   10.1.1. Description of Agreement. A statement that the supplier shall furnish supplies or
   services, described in general terms, if and when requested by the contracting officer (or the
   authorized representatives of the contracting officer) during a specified period and within a
   stipulated aggregate amount, if any.
   10.1.2. Extent of the Obligation. A statement that NAF is obligated only to the extent of
   authorized purchases actually made under the BPA.
   10.1.3. Purchase Limitation. A statement that specifies the dollar limitation for each
   individual under the BPA.
   10.1.4. Individuals Authorized to Purchase Under the BPA. A statement that a list of
   individuals authorized to purchase under the BPA identified either by title of position or by
   name of individual, organizational component, and the dollar limitation per purchase for each
   title or individual shall be furnished to the supplier by the contracting officer.
   10.1.5. Delivery Tickets. A requirement that all shipments under the agreement, except
   those for newspapers, magazines, or other periodicals, shall be accompanied by delivery
   tickets or sales slips that shall contain the following minimum information:
   10.1.5.1. Name of supplier
       10.1.5.2. BPA number
       10.1.5.3. Date of purchase
       10.1.5.4. Purchase number
       10.1.5.5. Itemized list of supplies or services furnished.
       10.1.5.6. Quantity, unit price, extension of each item, less applicable discounts (unit
       prices and extensions need not be reflected with the use of automated systems, provided
       the invoice is itemized.)
10.2. Prepriced and Unpriced BPAs. The Contracting Officer is responsible for determining
whether a prepriced or unpriced BPA should be established. Products or services that fluctuate in
price on a frequent basis are usually established as an unpriced BPA. The Contracting Officer
 32                                                      AFMAN64-302 16 NOVEMBER 2011


should attempt to ensure adequate competition is available when establishing sources that qualify
for BPAs.
   10.2.1. The Contracting Officer shall approve price lists or negotiate firm fixed pricing for
   prepriced BPAs. Approved price lists will contain the effective dates and a copy will be
   maintained with the BPA.
   10.2.2. Distribution. Copies of the price list or negotiated prices for services shall be dated
   and distributed to the applicable activities. The activities shall not solicit additional pricing
   discounts against the pre-negotiated prices. However, voluntary price reductions are
   acceptable if offered by the contractor.
   10.2.3. Items not covered by the BPA are not eligible for purchases under the BPA.
   Requirements for these items should be referred to the Contracting Officer for inclusion
   under the BPA.
   10.2.4. Documenting Calls. Calls against BPAs should be documented by the activity using
   the Call Register located in the NAF electronic purchasing system. Other controls may be
   established by the Contracting Officer as necessary. Sales slips, invoices, delivery tickets,
   and other commonly accepted documents may be used by the activity to verify receipt of
   goods. Discrepancies shall be noted. Documentation shall be forwarded to the appropriate
   paying office to support payment.
   10.2.5. Administration of BPA Calls. The activity that placed the call is responsible for
   follow-up action as it relates to delivery, cancellation, and other related matters. Problems
   that cannot be resolved will be referred to the Contracting Officer.
   10.2.6. Payment. Consolidated payments shall be made on a monthly basis. The specific
   time and conditions of payment are established within the terms of the BPA. BPAs for
   commodities subject to accelerated payment under the Prompt Payment Act (meat,
   perishables, etc.) shall contain appropriate payment provisions.
10.3. BDOs. A BDO provides a way of ordering undetermined quantities of supplies and
services through prepriced contracts using the call process similar to a BPA. A PR is required to
create a BDO. The total estimated dollar amount to be used during the specified time will be
identified on the order. The BDO is created against an existing contract using a purchase order
form.
10.3.1. The order should specify a time frame in which calls will be valid against the BDO,
however, the performance period of the BDO must fall within the performance period of
the source contract.
   10.3.2. The Contracting Officer shall provide the contractor a list of individuals or position
   titles authorized to place calls against the BDO. The list will include maximum call
   limitations. BDOs will be accomplished by using the same format as delivery orders. BDO
   numbering will be compatible with the NAF electronic purchasing system and local controls.
   10.3.3. Documenting Calls. Calls against BDOs must be documented by the activity using
   the Call Register located in the NAF electronic purchasing system. Other controls may be
   established by the Contracting Officer as necessary. Sales slips, invoices, delivery tickets,
   and other commonly accepted documents may be used by the activity to verify receipt of
AFMAN64-302 16 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                 33


   goods. Discrepancies shall be noted. Documentation shall be forwarded to the appropriate
   paying office to support payment.
   10.3.4. Administration of BDO Calls. The activity that placed the call is responsible for
   follow-up action as it relates to delivery, cancellation, and other related matters. Problems
   that cannot be resolved will be referred to the Contracting Officer.
   10.3.5. Payment. Consolidated payments shall be made on a monthly basis. The specific
   time and conditions of payment are established within the terms of the BPA. BPAs for
   commodities subject to accelerated payment under the Prompt Payment Act (meat,
   perishables, etc.) shall contain appropriate payment provisions.
10.4. Reviews. Annual review of BPAs and BDOs shall be performed by the Contracting
Officer to monitor compliance and to determine if continuance of the agreement is warranted.

                                          Chapter 11

                   SPECIAL TYPE CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS

11.1. Formats. The formats provided in the NAF electronic purchasing system for the special
contracts and agreements are mandatory for special contracts and agreements. All NAF contract
templates, including the NAF General and Special Provisions can be found in the Policy &
Training area of the AFNAFPO website: http://www.afnafpo.com/. Apply the guidance on the
special contracts and agreements discussed in this chapter. If the contractor’s social security
number is required by accounting to process appropriate Internal Revenue Service (IRS) forms, it
will be not be included as a part of the contract or stored in the NAF electronic purchasing
system. The Privacy Act precludes open access to certain information such as social security
numbers. Legal review is required when a change is made to the any of the contract templates.
11.2. Entertainment        Contracts. Commercial        entertainment     may     be    purchased
noncompetitively. Contracting with booking agents shall utilize the same format prescribed for
contracting directly with entertainment acts. Obtain legal review for contracts with agents.
11.3. Aircraft Lease Agreement. The Aero Club cannot operate the leased aircraft until
written approval is obtained from HQ AFSVA/SVPC. When approval has been obtained, the
Contracting Officer will submit a copy of the completed lease agreement to HQ AFSVA/SVXB
for inclusion in the Air Force Insurance Program. Extension of leases should be forwarded to HQ
AFSVA/SVXB.
11.4. Aero Club Instructor and Mechanic Contracts. These contracts include flight and
ground instructors, aircraft and power plant (A&P) mechanics, and inspection authorization
inspectors. These contracts may be entered into noncompetitively and paid on an hourly basis.
11.5. Individual Service Contracts (ISCs). These contracts may be entered into
noncompetitively. Insurance should be considered where unique risks are associated with the
services to be performed. These contracts are awarded to specified individuals for their unique
skills, experience, or knowledge in performing a service for the NAFI. Consider the Twenty
Common Law Factors in attachment 2 to determine whether an employer-employee relationship
will result. Contracts for individual services to a Federal agency are generally exempt from the
requirements of the Service Contract Act.
   11.5.1. An ISC will meet, as a minimum, the following criteria:
       11.5.1.1. Only the individual specified on the contract will perform the service.
       11.5.1.2. Payment should be based on a fixed amount or per job basis. Do not pay on a
       per hour basis or specify a percentage of the fees (except as authorized in Paragraph
       11.4).
       11.5.1.3. The ISC cannot exceed one year.
       11.5.1.4. The ISC does not create an employer/employee relationship (e.g., supervision
       by a government employee).
   11.5.2. Rights, benefits, and privileges that NAFI payroll employees accrue do not apply to a
   person who furnishes services under an ISC.
AFMAN64-302 16 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                       35


   11.5.3. Do not use ISCs in the following situations:
       11.5.3.1. For services that the individual is obligated to provide the NAFI as a result of
       his or her military or civilian employee position.
       11.5.3.2. For construction services.
       11.5.3.3. For services by an employee of the activity where performance of the service
       would create a conflict of interest. Consult with the base legal office for conflict of
       interest issues.
11.6. Nonpersonal Services. A nonpersonal service contract is negotiated with a contractor
(individual, corporation, etc.) for services that do not require unique skills and the individual or
individuals performing the service are not specified within the performance work statement of
the contract. The Services Contract Act may apply to nonpersonal services (see Para. 3.7.3.4).
For service contracts that will not exceed $2,500, the contractor must pay its employees at least
minimum wage. Service contracts that exceed $2,500 may require wage rate determinations for
various types of service employees. Therefore, service requirements greater than $2,500 in the
aggregate shall be forwarded to the local Servicing Contracting Office for purchase. The
purchase request form and the statement of work are provided to the SCO when establishing
nonpersonal service contracts.
11.7. Consignment Contract, Charter Flight/Tour Desk Concessionaire Contract, and
Ticket Consignment Agreement. Legal review is required if the prescribed format is changed
on any of these contracts.
11.8. Concessionaire Contract. Concessionaire contracts will be approved at one level above
the FSS Commander (or equivalent). (See AFI 34-262, Services Programs and Use Eligibility,
paragraph 2.6 for additional guidance.) Concessionaire contracts stipulate a fixed return to the
NAFI or provide for a percentage of the income. The gross amount (income to NAFI and income
to contractor) is used in determining the contract amount. Contracting Officers shall obtain
advance approval from the appropriate HQ AFSVA Program Manager before awarding a
contract to operate a club, golf course, bowling center, child care center, other services activities,
or any part thereof.
   11.8.1. NAF concessionaire contracts for aerial demonstrations or other MWR related events
   held off an Air Force installation should not be awarded unless the local community or other
   appropriate entity executes a MOA with the installation and requests or concurs that the
   installation may provide concessions or other services to support MWR related elements of a
   proposed event. Consult with your local legal office and call AFNAFPO if you need
   additional assistance."
11.9. Contracting for Training and Education. When NAFs are authorized to contract for
vocational training and part-time college level education of NAF personnel, compete training
and education needs in excess of $25,000 among commercial firms or educational institutions,
unless a sole source justification is included in the contract file.
11.10. Contracts with Government Employees. Contracts or lease agreements are authorized
with military personnel, government employees, or business organizations substantially owned
or controlled by government employees, when such contracts or leases are funded solely with
 36                                                  AFMAN64-302 16 NOVEMBER 2011


NAFs. However, legal review is required prior to the execution of any such contracts or
agreements.
11.11. Donations. NAF contracts funded completely with donations do not require competition
if the donor specifies the source to be used.
11.12. Purchasing of Advertising. See AFI 34-264, Services Marketing and Publicity
Program).
11.13. Public-Private Ventures (PPV). PPV contracts/agreements must be considered as
alternative methods of satisfying capital requirements in excess of $1 million for Category C
MWR activities. PPV arrangements may be used to provide only those services and activities
that are within the mission and scope of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) programs as
authorized in DoDI 1015.13, Department of Defense Procedures for Implementing Public-
Private Ventures (PPVS) for Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR), and Armed Services
Exchange Category C Revenue-Generating Activities. MWR services and activities provided
through PPV arrangements must be limited to authorized patrons (AFI 34-262, Services
Programs and Use Eligibility).
AFMAN64-302 16 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                    37


                                           Chapter 12

                              CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION

12.1. Contract Administration. Contract administration covers actions necessary to ensure
compliance with the terms and conditions of the order or contract. It includes, but is not limited
to monitoring contractor compliance and the resolution of problems associated with shipments
(lost or damaged goods), processing claims, payments, modifications and terminations. A
contract generally will be considered to be completed when final payment has been made under
the contract. Contracting Officers will not modify completed contracts. NAFIs will notify the
AFNAFPO of any contractor associated with the CSBP whose goods or services do not conform
to contract terms and conditions.
12.2. Inspection, Acceptance, and Receiving Reports. The receiving activity is the authorized
representative of the Contracting Officer for the purpose of conducting oversight and acceptance
of supplies and services when the contract provides for acceptance and/or inspection at final
destination. The receiving activity will accomplish acceptance/rejection of goods and services in
the NAF electronic purchasing system within 3 working days following delivery unless
otherwise specified in the order/contract. When the contracting office is advised that delivery did
not occur, the Contracting Officer will perform follow up within a reasonable time (maximum 7
days) after the original delivery date to determine the cause of delay and establish an acceptable
delivery date. For overseas activities, follow-up requests should be made within 30 days after
the delivery date to the stateside port. The delivery date identified on the order/contract for
shipments overseas is the required delivery date to the port and not the final destination. If
defective or nonconforming supplies are not rejected within the time allowed by the contract, or
in the absence of such provision, within a reasonable length of time, the NAFI will be considered
to have accepted them. If a contractor fails to make delivery after follow-up action, cancellation
of the order/contract may be executed if it is in the best interest of the NAFI.
   12.2.1. The following actions should be taken whenever a shipment is received:
       12.2.1.1. The receiving official should be present when goods are received.
       12.2.1.2. All boxes, cartons, packages, containers, etc., must be examined for damage
       before opening. Outside damage may consist of cave-ins, holes, water marks, etc.
       12.2.1.3. Inspection of actual goods should consist of at least matching stock numbers,
       quantity, kind, color, etc., with the contract and any modifications thereto. See
       Attachment 3 to file claims for the loss of or damage to in-transit NAF property.
   12.2.2. Receiving reports shall include acceptance by signature and date either electronically
   or manually. Sales slips, delivery tickets, DD Forms 250, Material Inspection and
   Receiving Report, AF Form 2209, electronic formats established for receiving, or other
   forms used commercially or internally are acceptable to verify receipt and acceptance of
   goods or services. Partial shipments should be processed in a timely manner to ensure
   payment to the contractor. Payments shall be made for partial deliveries when authorized by
   the terms of the order/contract.
   12.2.3. Proof-of-Shipment Procedure (Overseas only). Under the proof-of-shipment
   procedure, acceptance occurs when the shipment is received by the common carrier or the
 38                                                       AFMAN64-302 16 NOVEMBER 2011


   government representative at the Consolidation Containerization Point (CCP) or Port of
   Embarkation (POE). Inspection of goods is waived until receipt at final destination. Payment
   is made upon receipt of a proper invoice and proof of shipment.
12.3. Termination of Orders or Contracts. Only Contracting Officers are authorized to
terminate orders or contracts. Legal coordination/review will be obtained when any termination
action is contemplated. There are two types of terminations: Termination for Convenience (T
for C) and Termination for Default (T for D).
   12.3.1. Termination for Convenience occurs when the Contracting Officer determines that
   such termination is in the best interest of the NAFI. A termination for convenience may
   involve costs. Any termination costs exceeding the Contracting Officer’s warrant authority
   should be forwarded to the SCO or AFNAFPO for termination action. The parties may
   mutually agree to a no cost termination or cancellation.
   12.3.2. Termination for Default is warranted when the contractor fails to deliver supplies or
   perform services within the time specified in the contract, when the contractor fails to
   perform any other provision of the contract, or when the contractor fails to make progress so
   as to endanger performance of the contract. A termination for default must be supported by
   sufficient documentation to validate the termination. Before proceeding with a termination
   for default, the contractor should be issued a cure notice or show cause notice as appropriate.
   If, after compliance with the procedures in paragraphs 12.3.2.1 or 12.2.3.2, the Contracting
   Officer determines that a termination for default is proper, the Contracting Officer shall issue
   a notice of termination which includes the contract number and date; the acts or omissions
   constituting the default; that the contractor’s right to proceed further under the contract (or a
   specified portion of the contract) is terminated; that the supplies or services terminated may
   be purchased against the contractor’s account, and that the contractor will be held liable for
   any excess costs; that the NAFI reserves all rights and remedies provided by law or under the
   contract, in addition to charging excess costs; and that the contractor has the right to appeal
   the termination to AFNAFPO. The NAFI shall provide a copy of the notice of termination
   (electronically or in writing) to AFNAFPO.
       12.3.2.1. Cure notice. If a contractor fails to perform other provisions of the contract
       (such as not furnishing a required performance bond) or so fails to make progress as to
       endanger performance of the contract, the Contracting Officer shall give the contractor
       written notice specifying the failure and provide a period of 10 days (or longer period as
       necessary) in which to cure the failure. A cure notice shall be issued by certified mail,
       return receipt requested. Upon expiration of the 10 days (or longer period), the
       contracting officer may issue a notice of termination for default unless it is determined
       that the failure to perform has been cured.
       12.3.2.2. Show cause notice. If the contractor has failed to make delivery of the supplies
       or to perform the services within the specified time, a notice of failure or notice of the
       possibility of termination for default is not required to be sent to the contractor before the
       actual notice of termination. However, the contractor may be issued a show cause notice.
       This show cause notice should be sent immediately upon expiration of the delivery period
       and should state that failure of the contractor to present an explanation may be taken as
       an admission that no valid explanation exists. A show cause notice shall be issued by
       certified mail, return receipt requested.
AFMAN64-302 16 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                  39


12.4. Changes to Award Documents. Only Contracting Officers are authorized to issue
modifications to award documents. However, NAF activity personnel who have been delegated
the authority by the Contracting Officer to place calls can make changes to calls against
BPAs/BDOs provided the change is within the scope of the BPA/BDO. NAFs must be available
or obtained when additional funding is required.
   12.4.1. Use the SF 30, Amendment of Solicitation/Modification of Contract, or the format
   provided in the NAF electronic purchasing system to issue modifications or amendments to
   purchasing documents. The contracting office that issued the order/contract will make all
   modifications/amendments unless the written authority is delegated to another contracting
   office.
       12.4.1.1. Modifications/amendments           shall      be     numbered sequentially.
       Modification/amendment numbering shall be compatible with the NAF electronic
       purchasing system. Any downward adjustments do not require a modification unless the
       Contracting Officer deems it is in the best interest of the NAFI.
       12.4.1.2. Unilateral/Bilateral modifications are determined based on the nature of the
       change to the order/contract. Unilateral modifications require only the Contracting
       Officer’s signature whereas bilateral modifications require the signature of the
       Contracting Officer and the contractor’s authorized representative. Administrative
       changes usually can be accomplished with a unilateral modification whereas significant
       changes such as change in quantity, dollar adjustments, or changes in the delivery
       schedule require a bilateral modification. Bilateral modifications will be prepared and
       forwarded to the contractor for signature prior to signing by the Contracting Officer.
12.5. Protests. Protests involving NAF contracts (except when issued by an APF buying office)
are not subject to the jurisdiction of the General Accounting Office (GAO) or courts. AFNAFPO
makes determinations on protests for contracts executed centrally. Protests of base level
contracts will be resolved by the NAF Contracting Officer. All protests will be reviewed by the
servicing legal office prior to a final decision being issued.
   12.5.1. Protests shall be concise and logically presented to facilitate review by the agency.
   Failure to substantially comply with any of the requirements in the subparagraphs below may
   be grounds for dismissal of the protest.
       12.5.1.1. Protests shall include the following information:
          12.5.1.1.1. Name, address, and fax and telephone numbers of the protester;
          12.5.1.1.2. Solicitation or contract number;
          12.5.1.1.3. Detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds for the protest, to
          include a description of resulting prejudice to the protester;
          12.5.1.1.4. Copies of relevant documents;
          12.5.1.1.5. Request for a ruling by the agency; and,
          12.5.1.1.6. Statement as to the form of relief requested.
       12.5.1.1.7. All information establishing that the protester is an interested party for the
       purpose of filing a protest.
 40                                                       AFMAN64-302 16 NOVEMBER 2011


           12.5.1.1.8. All information establishing the timeliness of the protest.
       12.5.1.2. All protests filed directly with the agency will be addressed to the contracting
       officer or other official designated to receive protests.
   12.5.2. Protests based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent prior to
   bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals shall be filed prior to bid opening
   or the time set for receipt of initial proposals. All other protests shall be filed not later than
   10 calendar days after the basis of protest is known or should have been known.
   12.5.3. The contractor may appeal a protest decision within 10 calendar days of its issuance
   by AFNAFPO or the base NAF Contracting Officer. Comptroller General decisions and this
   manual are primary sources of authority for deciding protests.
   12.5.4. Decisions issued by AFNAFPO may be appealed to Deputy Assistant Secretary
   (DAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC. SAF/AQC is the protest appeal authority for AFNAFPO
   awarded acquisitions. SAF/AQC’s address: 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington D.C.
   20330-1060.
   12.5.5. Appeals of decisions issued by a base NAF Contracting Officer must be filed with
   the executing base’s NAF contracting office. The base NAF contracting office will forward
   the appeal to AFNAFPO, accompanied by a background paper outlining the facts, a copy of
   the contract and all related documents, and a proposed reply. The Director of AF NAF
   Purchasing will be the decision authority on appeals of decisions issued by the base NAF
   Contracting Officer.
12.6. Claims. The Contracting Officer is responsible for processing contract claims filed
against the NAFI. A claim by the contractor shall be certified in writing and submitted to the
Contracting Officer for a written decision. The Contracting Officer must immediately notify the
funds custodian and the Staff Judge Advocate in writing when a claim is filed by a contractor.
Include in the notification the amount claimed by the contractor. Additional funds must be
obtained by the Contracting Officer from the funds custodian before commitment of funds to
settle a claim when the amount of available funds on the purchase request would be exceeded.
12.7. NAF Ratification Procedures. The individual who committed the unauthorized purchase
will prepare a detailed statement of facts and a purchase request, then forward to his/her
supervisor for review and action. The supervisor will review the statement of facts for adequacy
and certify that the item(s)/services were received and used for an authorized purpose; that funds
were available at the time the commitment was made; and indicate what actions were taken to
prevent recurrence. The supervisor will forward all documentation (Employee’s Statement of
Facts, Supervisor’s Certification, Invoice, and funded Purchase Request) to the NAF Contracting
Officer. In the event a signed statement from the individual who made the unauthorized
commitment cannot be obtained, the supervisor of the individual will explain in writing why the
statement is unavailable. The NAF Contracting Officer will review the ratification package for
adequacy, prepare the necessary contractual documents, and forward to the servicing legal office
for review. After legal review, the package will be forwarded to the ratifying authority for
consideration. If approved by the ratifying authority, the Contracting Officer will sign the
contract and make appropriate distribution. If the action is not ratified the file must include the
method used to resolve the matter. At base level, the FSS Commander (or equivalent) may

approve ratifications up to and including $50,000. Ratifications that exceed that amount will be
forwarded to AFNAFPO for approval.

                                          Chapter 13

               ELECTRONIC COMMERCE (EC) IN NAF CONTRACTING

13.1. Electronic Commerce (EC). EC as it applies to NAF contracting means the exchange of
contracting information electronically between the NAFI and the private sector. The Internet
Based Purchasing System (IBPS) or other electronic purchasing system approved by AFNAFPO
will be used for purchases made by NAF activities.
13.2. Contracting Officer’s Signature. Contracting documents generated by automated
procurement systems may use an electronic signature to represent the Contracting Officer’s
authorization of the contract action. This authorization applies to all electronically generated
contracting documents, even when EC cannot be completely executed (e.g., some contractors
may not be capable of accepting EC). In this situation, the contracting office will mail the
electronically generated contracting document with the option to sign the hard copy. The
following conditions must be met for EC:
   13.2.1. Use of personal identification codes to control access to electronic generation
   software and to permit only the signer use of the digital signature.
   13.2.2. Transmission and storage of a discrete electronic symbol to represent the Contracting
   Officer’s signature.
   13.2.3. Use of a discrete authentication intended to bind, as a means of verifying the identity
   of the individual originating the contracting action and to validate transaction content.
   13.2.4. The electronic signature is linked to the data in the signed document in such a way
   that modification of the data would invalidate the signature.
   13.2.5. Entering documents by proxy. The NAF electronic purchasing system allows
   documents such as PR’s, orders, and contracts to be created and entered by proxy. Before
   using this function, Contracting Officers must ensure that documents with original signatures
   are electronically scanned and attached in the NAF electronic purchasing system.
13.3. Electronic Commerce Distribution. EC contracting systems may be used to distribute
contractual documents if they transmit all the information contained in the input to the reviewing
system and provide an electronic signature in accordance with paragraph 13.2.
13.4. Electronic Creation and Storage of Contract Files. Contracting activities shall create
and store contractual documents and files electronically and ensure:
   13.4.1. Access to document creation software and applications are controlled.
   13.4.2. Audit trails of transactions and significant events are maintained.
AFMAN64-302 16 NOVEMBER 2011                                                           43




  13.4.3. Electronic documents and files are executed by individuals acting within their
  authority.
  13.4.4. Dates and times of all records and modifications are defined and recorded.

Terms
Best Value—The expected outcome of a procurement that, in the NAFI’s estimation, provides
the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.
Branding—The term and business approach used to enhance an existing concept or operation.
Three types of branding include; National Retail Brands, In-house or Signature Brands, and
Manufacturer’s Brands. As referenced in this manual, branding is a method or business
relationship where a product or service is obtained from a vendor with an identifiable brand
name attached. The brand name may be identified with the vendor or the NAFI. Branding may
include purchase incentives and ancillary support programs.
Commander's Smart Buy Program—A cooperative purchasing program between installation
level NAF activities and the Air Force Nonappropriated Fund Purchasing Office.
Concessionaire Contract—A contract to furnish predetermined goods or services for sale. The
concessionaire agrees to pay the NAFI a negotiated percentage of gross sales or set fees.
Construction—The term ―construction‖ means construction, alteration, or repair (including
paving, dredging, excavating, and painting) of buildings, structures, or other real property. It
does not include the installation of carpet, wall covering, or draperies. Also, it does not include
the manufacture, production, furnishing, construction, alteration, repair, processing or
assembling of products or other kinds of personal property.
Continental United States (CONUS)—The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia,
further defined as the United States territory, including adjacent territorial waters, located within
the North American Continent between Canada and Mexico.
Contract—An agreement that creates a legal obligation. The elements of a contract are: (1) a
mutual agreement; (2) between competent parties; (3) for a legal purpose; (4) involving the
exchange of legal consideration; (5) which creates a mutuality of obligation to perform between
the parties. The term contract as used in this manual includes, without limitation, formal bilateral
contracts, purchase orders, agreements, and modifications as well as other agreements entered
into by an authorized Contracting Officer acting within his/her authority.
AFMAN64-302 16 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                      47


Contracting Officer—A person authorized in writing, either by appointment or by position, to
execute and administer contracts on behalf of a NAFI.
Delivery Order—An order issued against an existing contract.
Essential Products Program (EPP)—-Mandatory contracts issued by AFNAFPO.
FOB (Free On Board) Destination—Freight charges are included in the costs of supplies or
figured separately as a lump sum. The contractor or carriers are responsible for the risk of loss or
damage during shipment.
FOB (Free On Board) Origin—Freight is prepaid and billed separately on invoice by the
contractor. Claims for risk of loss or damage are between the NAFI and carrier.
Free Freight Allowed—Contractor assumes cost of freight, but claims for risk of loss or damage
are between the NAFI and carrier.
Interior Design Project—A design project involving changes to at least three elements of a
room (e.g., carpeting, draperies, lighting, wall art, furniture).
Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality (NAFI)—An integral DoD organizational entity that
performs a government function. It acts in its own name to provide or assist DoD components in
providing morale, welfare and recreational programs for military personnel and authorized
civilians. As a fiscal entity, it maintains custody and control over its nonappropriated funds. It is
not incorporated under the law of any state or of the District of Columbia and it enjoys the legal
status of an instrumentality of the United States.
Nonappropriated Fund Purchasing Agreement (NPA)—A fixed priced agreement, against
which delivery orders are issued using nonappropriated funds.
Petty Cash—A cash fund of a fixed amount set through an advance of funds, for immediate cash
payment of relatively small amounts for authorized buys of goods and services.
Purchase Order—A simplified method to buy goods or services. All necessary terms and
conditions are included in the order form, and the price is obtained based on oral or written
solicitations. A unilateral purchase order is where the NAFI issues an order for goods or services
without express written acceptance of the terms by the vendor. Acceptance occurs when and if
the vendor performs according to the order, at which time a binding contract is formed. A
bilateral purchase order is where both parties expressly agree to enter into mutual obligations (for
NAF contracting, this involves obtaining a vendor’s signature on a contract document before
performance).
Procurement—Includes, without limitation: purchasing, renting, and leasing of real or personal
property; construction (including third party financed projects), renovation and alteration of real
property; and obtaining goods, equipment, and services for either direct use of the NAFI or for

administration. Procurement does not include the determination of requirements.
Qualified Source—A contractor who is normally engaged in the type of work or sells, markets,
or distributes the product or service requested and from whom a valid quote could be reasonably
expected.

                                        Attachment 2
   TWENTY COMMON LAW FACTORS IN INDIVIDUAL SERVICE CONTRACTS

A2.1. Instructions. A worker who is required to comply with other persons’ instructions about
when, where, and how he or she is to work is ordinarily an employee. This control factor is
present if the person or persons for whom the services are performed have the right to require
compliance with instructions.
A2.2. Training. Training the worker by requiring an experienced employee to work with the
worker, by corresponding with the worker, by requiring the worker to attend meetings, or by
using other methods, indicates that the person or persons for whom the services are performed
want the services performed in a particular method or manner.
A2.3. Integration. Integration of the worker’s services into the overall business operations
generally shows that the worker is subject to direction and control. When the success or
continuation of a business depends to an appreciable degree upon the performance of certain
services, the workers who perform those services must necessarily be subject to a certain amount
of control by the owner of the business.
A2.4. Services Rendered Personally. If the services must be rendered personally, presumably
the person or persons for whom the services are performed are interested in the methods used to
accomplish the work as well as in the results, and the control factor is satisfied.
A2.5. Continuing Relationship. A continuing and regular relationship between the worker and
the person or persons for whom the services are performed indicates that an employer/employee
relationship exists. A continuing and regular basis may exist where work is performed at
frequently recurring, although irregular intervals.
A2.6. Set Hours Of Work. The establishment of set hours of work by the person or persons for
whom the services are performed is a factor indicating and showing necessary control.
A2.7. Doing Work On Employer’s Premises. If the work is performed on the premises of the
person or persons for whom the services are being performed, that factor suggests control over
the worker, especially if the work could be done elsewhere. Work done off the premise of the
person or persons receiving the services, such as at the office of the worker, indicates some
freedom from control. However, this fact by itself does not mean that the worker is not an
employee. The importance of this factor depends on the nature of the service involved and the
extent to which an employer generally would require that employees perform such services on
the employer’s premises. Control over the place of work is indicated when the person or persons
for whom the services are performed have the right to compel the worker to travel a designated
route, to canvas a territory within a certain time, or to work at specific places as required.
A2.8. Order Or Sequence Set. If a worker must perform services in the order or sequence set
by the person or persons for whom the services are performed, that factor shows that the worker
is not free to follow the worker’s own pattern of work but must follow the established routines
and schedules of the person or persons for whom the services are performed. Often, because of
the nature of an occupation, the person or persons for whom the services are performed do not
set the order of the services or set the order infrequently. It is sufficient to show control,
however, if such person or persons retain the right to do so.
 50                                                        AFMAN64-302 16 NOVEMBER 2011


A2.9. Oral Or Written Reports. A requirement that the worker submit regular or written
reports to the person or persons for whom the services are performed indicates a degree of
control appropriate for an employee.
A2.10. Payment Of Business And/Or Traveling Expenses. If the person or persons for whom
the services are performed ordinarily pay the worker’s business and/or traveling expenses, the
worker is ordinarily an employee. An employer, to be able to control expenses, generally retains
the right to regulate and direct the worker’s business activities
A2.11. Furnishing Of Tools And Materials. The fact that the person or persons for whom the
services are performed furnish significant tools, materials, and other equipment tends to show the
existence of an employer/employee relationship.
A2.12. Right To Discharge. The right to discharge a worker is a factor indicating that the
worker is an employee and the person possessing the right is an employer. An employer
exercises control through the threat of dismissal, which causes the worker to obey the employer’s
instructions. An independent contractor, on the other hand, cannot be fired so long as the
independent contractor produces a result that meets the contract specifications.
A2.13. Right To Terminate. If the worker has the right to end his or her relationship with the
person for whom the services are performed at any time he or she wishes without incurring
liability, that factor indicates an employer/employee relationship.
A2.14. Significant Investment. If the worker invests in facilities that are used by the worker in
performing services and are not typically maintained by employees (such as the maintenance of
an office rented at fair value from a related party), that factor tends to indicate that the worker is
an independent contractor. On the other hand, lack of investment in facilities indicates
dependence on the person or persons for which the services are performed for such facilities and
accordingly, the existence of an employer/employee relationship. Special scrutiny is required
with respect to certain types of facilities such as home offices.
A2.15. Realization Of Profit Or Loss. A worker who can realize a profit or suffer a loss as a
result of the worker’s services (in addition to the profit or loss ordinarily realized by employees)
is generally an independent contractor, but the worker who cannot is an employee. For example,
if the worker is subject to a real risk of economic loss due to significant investments or a bona
fide liability for expenses, such as salary payments to unrelated employees, that factor indicates
that the worker is an independent contractor. The risk that the worker will not receive payment
for his or her services, however, is common to both independent contractors and employees and
thus does not constitute a sufficient economic risk to support treatment as an independent
contractor.
A2.16. Working For More Than One Firm At A Time. If a worker performs more than
minimal services for a multiple of unrelated persons or firms at the same time, that factor
generally indicates that the worker is an independent contractor. However, a worker who
performs services for more than one person may be an employee of each of the persons,
especially where such persons are part of the same service arrangement.
A2.17. Making Services Available To General Public. The fact that a worker makes his or
her services available to the general public on a regular and consistent basis indicates an
independent contractor relationship.
AFMAN64-302 16 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                   51


A2.18. Hiring Supervising, And Paying Assistants. If the person or persons for whom the
services are performed hire, supervise, and pay assistants, that factor generally shows control
over the workers on the job. However, if one worker hires, supervises, and pays the other
assistants pursuant to a contract under which the worker is responsible only for the attainment of
a result, this factor indicates an independent contractor status.
A2.19. Full Time Required. If the worker must devote substantially full time to the business of
the person or persons for whom the services are performed, such person or persons have control
over the amount of time the worker spends working and thereby restricts the worker from doing
other gainful work. An independent contractor, on the other hand, is free to work when and for
whom he or she chooses.
A2.20. Payment By Hour, Week, Month. Payment by the hour, week, or month generally
points to an employer/employee relationship, provided that this method or payment is not just a
convenient way of paying a lump sum agreed upon as the cost of a job. Payment made by the job

  FILING CLAIMS FOR LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO INTRANSIT NAF PROPERTY

A3.1. Applicability. These instructions apply only to property in transit that is lost or damaged.
This refers to the period of time before receipt of the property by the servicing base
transportation office or by the NAFI to which the shipment is intended.
A3.2. General Information.
   A3.2.1. Claim Exemptions. A claim cannot be filed against:
       A3.2.1.1. The government for damage, shortage, or loss of goods when transportation is
       provided by a DoD military component (for example, US owned vessel, aircraft, or
       vehicle).
       A3.2.1.2. An Air Mobility Command (AMC) contract carrier, unless loss or damage
       occurs due to willful negligence by the aircraft crew, as provided in the contract with the
       contract air carrier.
   A3.2.2. Free on Board (FOB) Origin Shipments. Transportation charges for FOB origin
   shipments are prepaid by the contractor and billed as a separate item on the invoice. Title
   passes to the NAFI when the goods are turned over to the common carrier (freight company)
   at the point of the carrier's first receipt. Any claims for loss of or damage to goods on this
   type of shipment are filed against the common carrier (freight company) by the requiring
   NAFI. The Contracting Officer and the servicing legal office provide assistance in filing such
   claims. Payment for the goods, including any invoiced contractor prepaid transportation
   charges, regardless of loss of or damage, are made to the contractor pending settlement of the
   claim, particularly in any case where delay may result in the loss of any discount.
   A3.2.3. FOB Destination Shipments. Transportation charges for FOB destination shipments
   may be included in the cost of items, quoted as a lump sum amount, or prepaid and billed as
   a separate item on the invoice for payment. Risks of loss of or damage to goods on this type
   of shipment are filed against the common carrier by the contractor. The contractor is advised,
   in writing, through the Contracting Officer, of any discrepancies so that a timely claim can be
   filed. The NAFRMS must make prompt payment on goods accepted, particularly in any case
   where delay may result in the loss of a discount. No payment will be made for goods before
   acceptance.

       specific identification of the items determined to be over, short, or damaged, and indicate
       the current date. A notation, "OVER", "SHORT", or "DAMAGED", with a statement
       "SEE REVERSE", will be stamped or marked on the front of the carrier's delivery receipt
       or freight bill. The notations also will be made and signed on the reverse of the

  A3.4.4. Military Sealift Command (MSC) Shipments.
     A3.4.4.1. Claims for loss of or damage to goods against MSC contract carriers are
     mainly limited to bulk cargo and break-bulk-type container shipments that are broken
     down at the port and goods shipped to more than one consignee. Other ocean cargo sea
     van containers seldom are opened at the Port of Debarkation (POD) unless (i) damage

     during off-loading:
        A3.4.4.1.1. If a loss of or damage to goods occurs after acceptance at the POE during

     the container. Claims against a MSC contract carrier or stevedoring contractor are sent to
     the address provided by the servicing base transportation office.
     A3.4.4.3. If loss or damage is due to faulty packaging by the contractor, a claim should
     be placed against the contractor for the damage, by trained purchasing people, in a fair
     manner, showing favor to no one person, or group, or business firm, and to the best
     advantage of the NAFI.
