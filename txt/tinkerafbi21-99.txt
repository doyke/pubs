1. General Information: This publication provides information for use by OC-ALC personnel
in Depot Maintenance offices that initiate an AFMC Form 202 and PM/SCM Engineering offices
that respond to it. It complements AFMCMAN 21-1, Chapter 5, outlines a standard baseline for
AFMC Form 202 processing at the center and provides worksheets to assist OC-ALC Depot
Maintenance submitters and OC-ALC engineering and technical staff. Separate and unique local
problem resolution processes exist as approved waivers to AFMCMAN 21-1. This instruction
does not preclude or apply to existing authorizations that allows the OC-ALC FAA certified
maintenance paint shop to use the TO 00-25-107, Maintenance Assistance, process for the KC-
10 workload and the propulsion process to use TI 21-215, Control of Nonconforming Engine
Parts. Both exceptions are allowed to operate exclusively apart from this instruction.
2. Procedure:
     2.1. A process map at Attachment A2.1 provides the baseline process that will be used by
     OC-ALC PM/SCM technical organizations in support of AFMC Form 202s submitted by 76
     MXW production groups. It was developed in accordance with AFMCMAN 21-1, allowing
     each center to designate alternate methods for accomplishing functions, unless specifically
     assigned to a functional office.
        2.1.1. Depot Maintenance Planning and the Engineering/Technical Staff in the PM/SCM
        are responsible for accuracy and completeness of the AFMC Form 202.
             2.1.1.1. Planners are responsible for final validity for part A of AFMC Form 202
             requests submitted to the appropriate technical organizations as described in
             AFMCMAN 21-1. At OC-ALC, to facilitate this duty and provide standardized
             methods to enhance processing, an optional worksheet is provided at Attachment 3 to
             assist the Planners. The worksheet is not mandatory, but may be useful to ensure
             those not familiar with the process in reviewing all elements of the AFMC Form 202.
             At the discretion of the OC-ALC Depot Maintenance Production Groups, this
             worksheet may also be provided to others participating in the input process, in
             particular the shop supervisors and technicians involved in identifying problems to
             the planners. Part A of the worksheet lists considerations for original submission of
             the Form, while Part B addresses things the planner will want to briefly review to
             ensure a complete form has been returned from the PM/SCM organization. Individual
             organizations may supplement the information provided in Part A by adding
TINKERAFBI21-99 7 MARCH 2011                                                             3


       considerations appropriate to their individual management responsibilities. Where an
       organization adds such elements, organizational level guidance will be developed to
       specify how it will be used. A copy of this Organizational level guidance shall be
       provided to this instruction’s OPR.
          2.1.1.1.1. 76 AMXG production squadrons shall only generate and submit
          aircraft serial number unique AFMC Form 202 requests based on block 8 of the
          AFMC Form 202. Blanket authorization for problem resolution requests are not
          authorized for OC-ALC depot aircraft.
       2.1.1.2. The Engineering and Technical Staff of the respective PM/SCMs retain
       exclusive Technical Content Manager responsibility. As such they provide approved
       data in response to AFMC Form 202 requests under conditions specified in AFMCI
       21-301, Air Force Materiel Command Technical Order System Implementing
       Policies, and AFMCMAN 21-1. The responsible engineer will include in block 22
       any applicable TO references (e.g. TO number, Work package/Supplemental Work
       Package number, paragraph, figure, and/or page). At OC-ALC, to facilitate this duty
       and provide standardized methods to enhance processing, a worksheet is provided at
       Attachment 4 to assist the Engineers in developing technical data in response to
       AFMC Form 202 requests. The worksheet is not mandatory, but may be useful to
       ensure those not familiar with the process in reviewing all elements of the AFMC
       Form 202. Individual organizations may supplement these by adding technical
       considerations appropriate to their individual management responsibilities. Where an
       organization adds such elements, organizational level guidance will be developed to
       specify how it will be used. A copy of this Organizational level guidance shall be
       provided to this instruction’s OPR.
       2.1.1.3. The worksheets may be used as guidelines to ensure all needed information
       has been provided at each major step to minimize rework due to oversight in
       completion of the AFMC Form 202. Automated processing systems may incorporate
       some or all of the worksheet elements through appropriate filters, screens or other
       validity checking mechanisms to enhance the accuracy of the requests processed.
       2.1.1.4. The worksheet will not be attached to the AFMC Form 202 when it is
       forwarded from the planner to the PM/SCM organization, or when the PM/SCM
       organization returns the completed AFMC Form 202 to the requesting organization.
       Planners and PM/SCM Engineering personnel will use the respective worksheets as
       needed to ensure that the AFMC Form 202 is correct and complete before releasing
       the AFMC Form 202 to the next stage in the process. An AFMC Form 202 not
       containing all required information (including TO information in block 22 for filing
       extended use AFMC Form 202 ) will note which element(s) need rework before they
       can be processed in the notes section when provided in an electronic processing
       system. Organizations may at their option retain copies of the worksheet with file
       copies of AFMC Form 202, but this is not required.
       2.1.1.5. The Technical Order Distribution Offices responsible for maintaining
       libraries will file the completed AFMC Form 202 when required as directed in
       AFMCMAN 21-1. Such filing will be according to TO reference provided in Block
 4                                                        TINKERAFBI21-99 7 MARCH 2011


            22. When incomplete TO information is received in block 22 of an extended use
            AMFC Form 202, TODO will return to the planner for action.
        2.1.2. In order to keep pace with the implementation of critical path management
        philosophies into depot processes, it is important the AFMC Form 202 nonconforming
        technical assistance problem resolution process incorporate critical path priorities without
        degrading the overall AFMC Form 202 process and OSS&E. To address these critical
        path concerns, Attachment 5 of this instruction defines a collaborative Special Handling
        Problem Resolution (SHPR) process to proactively identify and address AFMC Form 202
        dispositions anticipated to have significant negative impact to maintenance critical path
        schedules.
     2.2. AFMCMAN 21-1 directs Center reviews of the AFMC Form 202 process. These shall
     be accomplished as follows:
        2.2.1. The Maintenance Wing Quality Assurance (QA) Activity shall evaluate and
        identify AFMC Form 202 process compliance trends on a quarterly basis. The process
        shall be evaluated for compliance with AFMCMAN 21-1 and local policy within the
        Maintenance Wing. The quarterly findings shall be reviewed with the Maintenance Wing
        EN in accordance with AFMAN 21-1, paragraph 5.5.10.1.
        2.2.2. The Aircraft Sustainment Directorate EN (or designee) and the 448 SCMG EN
        shall review perform quarterly review audits aligned with the requirement for the Wing
        EN requirement in AFMCMAN 21-1, paragraph 5.5.10.1. Results of the quarterly
        reviews shall be forwarded to the Center EN 202 focal point.
3. Records:
     3.1. Evidence of periodic reviews, retained by individual PM/SPM and Maintenance QA
     offices, will include indication that the worksheet items were reviewed and note any
     suggested changes submitted to the OPR for this policy as a result of that review.
     3.2. OPR for this policy will retain copy of suggested changes/updates submitted in
     accordance with paragraph 2.2. Copies of all suggested changes whether adopted or not will
     be retained until this instruction is superseded or rescinded.

Terms
AFMC Form 202— The document used within a depot-level maintenance activity to request the
responsible engineer to develop technical data or determine serviceability when published data is
not adequate to complete the task at hand. The AFMC Form 202 is also used to alleviate parts or
material shortages in cases of critical shortage and urgent need to prevent maintenance or
modification work stoppage by authorizing substitutes determined suitable by the responsible
program engineers. AFMCMAN 21-1 provides overall guidance for preparing the AFMC Form
202.
NOTE—: DO NOT use the AFMC Form 202 to initiate routine corrective TO updates. Waivers
to use alternate IMTs or Forms will apply only to organizations specifically listed in an approved
waiver.
Anticipated Work Stoppage (reference AFMCMAN 21—1, Attachment 1) - (See Work
Stoppage) Spare assets are available and the discrepancy or deficiency WILL NOT halt
production or delay the schedule or delivery of the end item. Anticipated work stoppage
situations will become work stoppage when not resolved in time to prevent schedule delays.
Critical Path— The sequence of major groupings of PDM activities that must be completed on
schedule to ensure depot maintenance for an individual weapon system item is completed on
schedule.
Depot Maintenance— This designates all workloads performed by the organic facilities of the
Depot Maintenance Activity Group (DMAG). It includes both depot level maintenance
accomplished both for the Air Force and other services using those Air Force DMAG resources.
Planner— Persons (typically GS0895, Industrial Engineering Technicians) responsible for
development, preparation, revision, coordination and accuracy of technical content of Work
Control Documents (WCDs). Reviews/updates/maintains files of WCD change requests, and
maintains documentation for AFMC Form 202s. Details are contained in AFI 21-101
AFMCSUP I, paragraph 18.8.1.1.

Technical Content Manager— The individual, usually an Equipment Specialist or Engineer,
responsible for maintaining the accuracy, adequacy, modification, classification, review, and
currency of the technical content of Technical Orders (TOs) and Time Compliance Technical
Orders (TCTOs) supporting assigned systems, commodities or processes.
Technical data— The only authorized source of information used to perform work or locally
developed instructions to accomplish technical requirements. Details are contained in AFI 21-
101 AFMCSUP I, paragraph 19.1.
Work Stoppage (reference AFMCMAN 21—1, Attachment 1) - Work stoppage refers to the
inability to proceed with production on a repair or modification of an end item or commodity, or
where a given process stops due to nonconforming material, inadequate technical data, or lack of
proper parts, materials, components, tooling or facilities. Halted production of a component or
part that prevents the repair or continued scheduled production flow of an end item constitutes a
work stoppage.

            WORKSHEET FOR ENGINEERS PROCESSING AFMC IMT 202

(Organizations may add items to account for technical consideration unique to their
workloads, see 2.1.1.2)
                              Section Numbers identify Form block numbers
 OVERALL: Time considerations should be based on the received date and on work stoppage
 condition
 If you will not meet the deadline, advise planner accordingly (AFMCMAN 21-1, paragraph 5.4)
 17. Verify correct organization for returning AFMC Form 202
 18. Verify your org symbol
 19. Date (Required) (Date/Time - received in PM/SCM activity)
 20. Engineer/ES Name and Phone Number (Engineer that produced disposition in Block 22) (Note:
 The ES is no longer authorized to produce the disposition for block 22)
 21. Must Check Proper Box (Do Not Leave Blank, use ―Other‖ for any N/A responses)
 22. Contact shop / Coordinate with shop to obtain a valid understanding of the problem, visit site to
 collect first hand information and documentation if possible.
 Specific Considerations:
     a) Is disposition clear, specific, and step-by-step?
     b) Does disposition include all appropriate Warnings, Cautions, and Notes?
     c) If TO or other technical guidance already exists for this discrepancy, is it consistent with
 disposition (if not indicated by Part A input, include enough information to allow Tech Order
 Distribution Office (TODO) to file with TO correctly, such as applicable TO para, page number, work
 package with page or item number or comparable reference)? If not, is TO/tech data change needed?
     d) Is this AFMC Form 202 in reference to a TO or a Tail/Serial/206 Job number? Need to be clear.
 If it applies to a Tail/Serial, or AFMC Form 206, Temporary Work Request, Job number, clearly
 reference that in block 23B, DO NOT put a rescission date in 23A. Many drawing related questions are
 actually in support of a local manufacturing request via a 206 job. Otherwise, an AFMC Form 202 will
 need to very specifically reference the TO, include the rescission date in 23A. TODO cannot file
 without specifics, approved by the technical content manager. If not requiring SH252, but extended
 use, indicate TO and para, page, and/or figure num if not provided in Part A or not matching that
 originally provided Part A. Complete instructions (ref AFMCMAN 21-1, 5.6.1.2.) include this as it is
 necessary for TODO responsibilities directed in AFMCMAN 21-1, 5.6.2.2.
     e) Is disposition a waiver of contractual or approved PDM/Depot Work task? AFMC Form 202
 CANNOT be used to delete tasks. Follow formal waiver process appropriate to your organization.
     f) Does disposition degrade reliability and performance or change form, fit, and function beyond
 acceptable limits as determined by chief engineer? (AFMCMAN 21-1, 5.4.3.) If so, check that EAA
 has approval authority delegated or elevate to chief engineer as needed.
     g) Coordinate with Planning as required to ensure that material and parts required in the instructions
 are available. Revise materials and/or parts if necessary and permissible from and OSS&E perspective.
     h) If Engineering determines that this will become an on-going parts requirement, has action been
 taken to ensure the part is stock listed or SPR initiated
 23. Must have either A or B, not both, if date (A), cannot exceed 120 days from date of approval
 signature (26.e) , or N/A if attaching Special Handling AFTO Form 252 or AFMC Form 202 is
 disapproved/unnecessary. Use a rescission date if block 8 has been specified N/A (If Approved).

24. Considerations
   a) If the solution requires a TO change, check the TO Change box and attach the SH 252 to the
AFMC Form 202 and obtain TO Manager Co-ordination (Block 26 D)
   b) If the solution requires a drawing change, check the drawing change box and attach the
preliminary drawing change.
   c) If the solution requires Safety and or Bio Environmental coordination, check the Safety and or
Bio Environmental box and obtain appropriate coordination in blocks 26 B and or C.
25. Considerations:
   a) Is an AFTO IMT 95 (Significant Historical Record) needed?
   b) Is an AFTO Form 781 (Delayed Discrepancy) needed?
   c) Is a DD Form 1574 (Condition Code) needed?
       - If yes, enter an appropriate statement, name, office symbol, phone number, and
AFMC Form 202 control number in block 25. If no to above, enter N/A in block 25
Use of these Forms/IMTs are described in TO-00-20-1.
26A. Date/Time (hour/min) and Signature of Engineer (REQUIRED) and appropriate coordination –
time information will be on IMT or retained in automated data system(s).
26 B,C,D. Printed Name, Date and Signatures where applicable per block 24
26E. Name, Signature and Date of Engineering Approval Authority.

                           SPECIAL HANDLING 202 PROCESS

Note: This document is applicable to all OC-ALC ―Aircraft‖ maintenance organizations for
weapon systems that have maintenance accomplished at OC-ALC and the associated Tinker
AFB System Program Office (SPO) organization where the possibility of AFMC Form 202
submissions and disposition are necessary.
A5.1. Purpose
   A5.1.1. The purpose of this attachment is to describe the Special Handling Problem
   Resolution (SHPR) process intended for use in expediting handling of those technical
   problems directly linked to aircraft production critical path. The provisions of this document
   shall not supersede, substitute or deviate from the higher level AFMC Form 202 processing
   requirements IAW AFMCMAN 21-1. Figure A5.1 represents the overall SHPR process.
   The goals include:
   A5.1.2. Provide a method and forum for collaboration between the cognizant engineering
   authority for a weapon system/item and OC-ALC maintenance organizations for optimizing
   overall customer support to the war-fighter and resource utilization.
   A5.1.3. Awareness of the potential production impacts, when identified, of an AFMC Form
   202 when a significant production impact is anticipated based on historical results and
   critical path scheduling.
   A5.1.4. Provide additional metrics on SHPR and related AFMC Form 202 dispositions to
   facilitate continual process improvement (para A.5.4.4.1)
   A5.1.5. Identify repairs and correction of deficiencies that are candidates for future planned
   depot work efforts.

A5.2. Scope
 16                                                       TINKERAFBI21-99 7 MARCH 2011


   A5.2.1. The scope for the SHPR process is a specialized selection and handling process
   intended to supplement the 202 process for unique problem resolution cases where
   significant production impact is anticipated based on historical results and critical path
   scheduling. This process assures sufficient attention, resources, oversight and documentation
   are brought together to ensure optimal processing results for a critical path problem.
   A5.2.2. The SHPR process is not a substitute for the AFMC Form 202 ―Engineering
   Disposition for Nonconforming Technical Problems beyond Published Authority‖ process.
   The ―Special Handling‖ elements of the SHPR process comprise a set of actions and analyses
   to determine the optimal disposition recommendation in conjunction with 202 submittal and
   completion of AFMC Form 202, Part A. The goal is to capture and provide all required
   defect assessment information and production impacts in conjunction with 202 submittal.
   All communication and direction regarding disposition, instructions, procedures etc. from
   engineering to maintenance will follow the established 202 process.
   A5.2.3. The SHPR process will not be used as a substitute for a normal ―Work Stoppage
   202‖ and prioritization process. All problem resolution requests should be allowed
   consideration for the SHPR process. The SHPR screening process is expected to result in less
   than 10% of all 202’s requiring the SHPR process. The process will be monitored for
   percent of 202’s requiring SHPR as indicated in para A5.4.4.2.2. The SHPR process starts
   when initial screening indicates a defect or anomaly is expected to impact or present
   challenges to meeting the critical path maintenance flow for the product line. The process
   ends when the defect or anomaly has been resolved.
      A5.2.4. Applicability: This process is applicable to all OC-ALC ―Aircraft‖ maintenance
      organizations for weapon systems that have maintenance accomplished at OC-ALC and the
      associated Tinker AFB System Program Office (SPO) organization where the possibility of
      202 submissions and disposition are necessary.
A5.3. Special Handling Process Description
   A5.3.1. The SHPR process will be described in 8 phases as explained below and depicted in
   Figure A5.2.
         A5.3.1.1. Phase 1: Identification: The purpose of the identification phase is to generate
         initial concerns and observations for consideration for SHPR entry criteria at the same
         time the 202 part A is being developed and input into the system. This initial screening
         process is accomplished by maintenance as a quick assessment of critical path impact
         potentials which may include select Subject Matter Experts. All open 202s will be
         entered to a 202 Work in Progress (WIP) report (for 202 WIP Report example, see Figure
         A5.3). This evaluation is not to interfere with the 202 part A generation.
         A5.3.1.2. Phase 2: Validation: A Special Handling Review Team (SHRT) will review
         the 202 WIP Report periodically and validate which 202’s meet the SHPR Entry Criteria
         (for Entry Criteria example, see Figure A5.4). 202’s meeting the Entry Criteria will be
         noted on the 202 WIP Report and a copy shall be made available to SHRT members.
         Team make-up is described in Figure A5.1. The review period and formal/informal
         nature of the SHRT reviews will be established by each maintenance group but should
         support standard response and 202 cycle time requirements. The 76 MXW production
         Group will establish and publish entry criteria to ensure consistency and standardization.
TINKERAFBI21-99 7 MARCH 2011                                                                     17


      The criteria will be subject to review and adjustment as necessary by 76 MXW EN (see,
      para A5.4.4.2.2 below).
Note: Communication of validation status within the SPO/SCM Engineering community is
critical as 202 dispositions will already be in work and may be nearing completion.

      A5.3.1.3. Phase 3: Supportability Review: For all 202’s identified as meeting the entry
      criteria a Special Handling Supportability Review Team (SHSRT) will assess the
      supportability of potential dispositions. The SHSRT will use the Supportability Checklist
      as a guide to determine if further supportability evaluation is warranted (see Figure A5.5
      for example checklist). The SHSRT will be comprised as indicated in, Figure A5.1 and
      will seek to find a mutually desirable solution and understanding of associated
      supportability requirements. If team consensus can be reached, the consensus solution
      will be supported by team members and communicated to the 202 Engineering Workload
      Manager (Engineering Approval Authority) and tracked through to problem resolution.
      If a mutual solution cannot be found or cannot be supported by the team the process will
      be moved into Phase 4.
      A5.3.1.4. Phase 4: Documented Supportability Assessment and Recommendation: In
      those 202’s where there is not agreement or a SPO supported disposition exists , the
      purpose of phase 4 is to document disposition supportability assessments and make a
      solution recommendation on a SHPR Supportability Matrix (see Figure A5.5 for
      example).      This allows the maintenance Production Group to document their
      recommendation with supporting information and apply the data to the 202 as
      attachments. The applied data will allow the SPO/SCM Engineering to make informed
      decisions as related to maintenance impact. This will also allow senior leaders and
      stakeholders to have situational awareness of impacts early in the process.
      A5.3.1.5. Phase 5: Standard Disposition and Instruction Process: The purpose of phase 5
      is to process AFMC Form 202s associated with SHPR efforts in accordance with the
      standard 202 disposition and instruction process. The SHPR differs only in the amount
      of investigation, communication and added information afforded the disposition authority
      for this phase. Dispositions for 202s following the SHPR which are not in accord with
      SHSRT consensus should be communicated to SHSRT members as soon as possible as
      deemed by the authorizing authority to afford adjustment to resource and flow impact and
      planning activities.
      A5.3.1.6. Phase 6: Review and process Part C: Standard 202 Part C review and
      processing is expected with the added requirement to provide SHPR information to
      management. At a minimum this information should be provided to SHSRT and all other
      organizations specifically identified by the SHSRT.
      A5.3.1.7. Phase 7: Execution and Evaluation for Completion: After the AFMC Form
      202 is completed, the maintenance process to execute the AFMC Form 202 part B
      instructions is still necessary and referred to as Part D for this process. Phase 7 is defined
      as the period of time that begins immediately following maintenance acceptance of the
      AFMC Form 202 and ends when the AFMC Form 202 Part B instructions are
      implemented or further instructions are required. Execution performance will be
      monitored to assure the original problems are resolved. If resolution of the problem is
18                                                    TINKERAFBI21-99 7 MARCH 2011


     not achieved, further problem identification and solutions must be pursued by returning
     to the beginning of phase 1.
     A5.3.1.8. Phase 8: Reporting and metrics: The SHPR process ends when the defect or
     anomaly has been resolved and the impacts have been identified and reported. The
     purpose of Phase 8 is to provide key metric data that measures the results, impacts of the
     SHPR for the purposes of future strategic planning, alignment and continual process
     improvement.

         A5.4.3.2.2. Access: Access to view file data will be managed by a 76 AMXG SHPR
         information administrator. To ensure proper availability, access to all data will be
         made available to all interested organizations/individuals involved in the 202
         processing and have a legitimate need to know, for the purposes reviewing
         performance or creating tailored metrics to support organizational needs.
  A5.4.4. Phase 8: Reporting and Metrics
     A5.4.4.1. Metrics:
         A5.4.4.1.1. Each maintenance organization that participates directly in the 202
         process will develop baseline metrics applicable to facilitating continual process
         improvement within their respective organizations. These metrics and supporting
         data shall be made available to all organizations. To monitor the process, data
         supporting the following metrics shall be made available:
            A5.4.4.1.1.1. Percentages of 202s that enter Phase 3 and Phase 4,
            A5.4.4.1.1.2. Percentage of SHPRs that have follow-on chained 202s/SHPRs,
            A5.4.4.1.1.3. Elapsed time for problem resolution.
         A5.4.4.1.2. Additional MXW, GK and SCMG metrics should be considered and
         developed as required to monitor process and create opportunities for process
         improvement.
     A5.4.4.2. Reports:
         A5.4.4.2.1. The OC-ALC/EN Center EN 202 focal point will use the SHPR data
         made available by 76 AMXG/QP (para A5.4.1.3.2) as the primary source of
         information to create a monthly Center level SHPR report.
         A5.4.4.2.2. When reports show trends of greater than 10 percent of an organization’s
         problem resolution requests complete the SHPR process, the OC-ALC/EN 202 focal
         point will review the process with 76 MXW EN, 76 AMXG Production Squadron
         Chief, and the SPM Chief Engineer, to validate the requirement and providing
         feedback and control of both SHPR process and policy or to adjust consideration
         criteria accordingly.
