     (PA) requirements and are referred to as PA systems of records. The Air Force must publish
     notices in the Federal Register, describing the collection of information for new, changed or
     deleted systems to inform the public and give them an opportunity to comment before
     implementing or changing the system. (see Attachment 2).

local systems manager will investigate complaints, or allegations of PA violations; will establish
and review the facts when possible; interview individuals as needed; determine validity of the
complaint; take appropriate corrective action; and ensure a response is sent to the complainant
through the PA Officer. In cases where no system manager can be identified, the local PA officer
will assume these duties. Issues that cannot be resolved at the local level will be elevated to the
MAJCOM Privacy Office. When appropriate, local system managers will also: refer cases for
more formal investigation, refer cases for command disciplinary action, and consult the servicing
SJA.

   during the litigation process. When the court renders a formal opinion or judgment,
   AFLSA/JACL sends AF-CIO/P a copy of the judgment and opinion.
1.4. Personal Notes. The Privacy Act does not apply to personal notes on individuals used as
memory aids. Personal notes may become Privacy Act records if they are retrieved by name or
other personal identifier and at least one of the following three conditions apply: (1) keeping or
destroying the records is not at the sole discretion of the author; (2) the notes are required by oral
or written directive, regulation, or command policy; or (3) they are shown to other agency
personnel.
1.5. Systems of Records Operated by a Contractor. Contractors who are required to operate
or maintain a PA system of records by contract must follow this instruction for collecting,
safeguarding, maintaining, using, accessing, amending and disseminating personal information.
The record system affected is considered to be maintained by the Air Force and is subject to this
instruction. Systems managers for offices who have contractors operating or maintaining such
 8                                   AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011


record systems must ensure the contract contains the proper PA clauses, and identify the record
system number, as required by the Defense Acquisition Regulation and this instruction.
     1.5.1. Contracts for systems of records operated or maintained by a contractor will be

designees of those offices may ask another agency for records for law enforcement under 5
U.S.C. 552a(b)(7). The requesting office must indicate in writing the specific part of the record
desired and identify the law enforcement activity asking for the record.
2.2. Confidentiality Promises. Promises of confidentiality must be prominently annotated in

                                           Chapter 3

                       COLLECTING PERSONAL INFORMATION

3.1. How To Collect Personal Information. Collect personal information directly from the
subject of the record whenever possible. Only ask third parties when:
   3.1.1. You must verify information.
   3.1.2. You want opinions or evaluations.
   3.1.3. You can‘t contact the subject.
   3.1.4. You are doing so at the request of the subject individual.
3.2. When To Give Privacy Act Statements (PAS). Give a PAS orally or in writing to the
subject of the record when you are collecting information from them that will go in a system of
records. NOTE: Do this regardless of how you collect or record the answers. You may display a
sign in areas where people routinely furnish this kind of information. Give a copy of the PAS if
asked. Do not ask the person to sign the PAS.
   3.2.1. A PAS must include four items:
       3.2.1.1. Authority: The legal authority, that is, the U.S.C. or Executive Order authorizing
       the program the system supports.
       3.2.1.2. Purpose: The reason you are collecting the information and what you intend to
       do with it.
       3.2.1.3. Routine Uses: A list of where and why the information will be disclosed outside
       DOD.
       3.2.1.4. Disclosure: Voluntary or Mandatory. (Use Mandatory only when disclosure is
       required by law and the individual will be penalized for not providing information.)
       Include any consequences of nondisclosure in nonthreatening language.
3.3. Requesting the Social Security Number (SSN). When asking an individual for his or her
SSN, always give a Privacy Act Statement that tells the person: (1) the legal authority for
requesting it; (2) the uses that will be made of the SSN; and (3) whether providing the SSN is
voluntary or mandatory. Do not deny anyone a legal right, benefit, or privilege for refusing to
give their SSN unless the law requires disclosure, or a law or regulation adopted before January
1, 1975 required the SSN and the Air Force uses it to verify a person‘s identity in a system of
records established before that date.
   3.3.1. The Air Force requests an individual‘s SSN and provides the individual information
   required by law when anyone enters military service or becomes an Air Force civilian
   employee. The Air Force uses the SSN as a service or employment number to reference the
   individual‘s official records. When you ask someone for an SSN as identification to retrieve
   an existing record, you do not have to restate this information.
   3.3.2. Executive Order 9397, Numbering System for Federal Accounts Relating to Individual
   Persons, authorizes using the SSN as a personal identifier. This order is not adequate
   authority to collect an SSN to create a record. When law does not require disclosing the SSN
   or when the system of records was created after January 1, 1975, you may ask for the SSN,
AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011                                               13


  but the individual does not have to disclose it. If the individual refuses to respond, use
  alternative means of identifying records.
  3.3.3. SSNs are personal and unique to each individual. Protect them as FOR OFFICIAL
  USE ONLY (FOUO). Within DOD, do not disclose them to anyone without an official need
  to know. Outside DOD, they are not releasable without the person‘s consent, or unless
  authorized under one of the 12 exceptions to the Privacy Act (see paragraph 12.4).

                                            Chapter 4

                      GIVING ACCESS TO PRIVACY ACT RECORDS

4.1. Making a Request for Access. Persons or their designated representatives may ask for a
copy of their records in a system of records. Requesters need not state why they want access to
their records. Verify the identity of the requester to avoid unauthorized disclosures. How you
verify identity will depend on the sensitivity of the requested records. Persons may use a notary
or an unsworn declaration in the following format: ―I declare under penalty of perjury (if outside
the United States, add ―under the laws of the United States of America‖) that the foregoing is
true and correct. Executed on (date). (Signature).‖
4.2. Processing a Request for Access. Consider a request from an individual for his or her own
records in a system of records under both the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the PA
regardless of the Act cited. The requester does not need to cite either Act if the records they want
are contained in a system of records. Process the request under whichever Act gives the most
information. When necessary, tell the requester which Act you used and why.
   4.2.1. Requesters should describe the records they want. They do not have to name a system
   of records number, but they should at least name a type of record or functional area. For
   requests that ask for ―all records about me,‖ ask for more information and tell the person how
   to review the Air Force systems of records published in the Federal Register or at
   http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy/notices/usaf.
   4.2.2. Requesters should not use government equipment, supplies, stationery, postage,
   telephones, or official mail channels for making PA requests. System managers will process
   such requests and tell requesters that using government resources to make PA requests is not
   authorized.
   4.2.3. Tell the requester if a record exists and how to review the record. If possible, respond
   to requests within 10 workdays of receipt. If you cannot answer the request in 10 workdays,
   send a letter explaining why and give an approximate completion date no more than 20
   workdays after the first office received the request.
   4.2.4. Show or give a copy of the record to the requester within 30 workdays of receiving the
   request unless the system has an exemption published in the Federal Register as a final rule.
   Give information in a form the requester can understand. If the system is exempt under the
   PA, provide any parts releasable under FOIA, with appeal rights (see Chapter 6), citing
   appropriate exemptions from the Privacy Act and FOIA, if applicable.
   4.2.5. If the requester wants another person present during the record review, the system
   manager may ask for written consent to authorize discussing the record with another person
   present.
4.3. Fees. Give the first 100 pages free, and charge only reproduction costs for the remainder.
Copies cost $.15 per page; microfiche costs $.25 per fiche. Charge fees for all pages for
subsequent requests for the same records. Do not charge fees:
4.3. (TYNDALLAFB)System Managers (Chief of the Office owning records) will collect
fees as applicable for Privacy Act Requests. All fees collected for Privacy Act requests will be
AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011                                                       15


immediately submitted to the local Defense Finance Accounting Service office. List the
collection on DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher.
   4.3.1. When the requester can get the record without charge under another publication (for
   example, medical records).
   4.3.2. For search.
   4.3.3. For reproducing a document for the convenience of the Air Force.
   4.3.4. For reproducing a record so the requester can review it.
   4.3.5. Fee waivers. Waive fees automatically if the direct cost of reproduction is less than
   $15, unless the individual is seeking an obvious extension or duplication of a previous
   request for which he or she was granted a waiver. Decisions to waive or reduce fees that
   exceed $15 are made on a case-by-case basis.
4.4. Denying or Limiting Access. System managers process access denials within 5 workdays
after you receive a request for access. When you may not release a record, send a copy of the
request, the record, and why you recommend denying access (include the applicable exemption)
to the denial authority through the legal office and the PA office. Judge Advocate (JA) offices
will include a written legal opinion. The PA officer reviews the file, and makes a
recommendation to the denial authority. The denial authority sends the requester a letter with the
decision. If the denial authority grants access, release the record. If the denial authority refuses
access, tell the requester why and explain pertinent appeal rights (see Chapter 6).
   4.4.1. Before you deny a request for access to a record, make sure that:
       4.4.1.1. The system has an exemption published in the Federal Register as a final rule.
       4.4.1.2. The exemption covers each document. (All parts of a system are not
       automatically exempt.)
       4.4.1.3. Nonexempt parts are segregated.
   4.4.2. Special Provision for Certain Medical Records. If a physician believes that
   disclosing requested medical records could harm the person‘s mental or physical health, you
   should:
       4.4.2.1. Ask the requester to get a letter from a physician to whom you can send the
       records. Include a letter explaining to the physician that giving the records directly to the
       individual could be harmful.
       4.4.2.2. Offer the services of a military physician other than one who provided treatment
       if naming the physician poses a hardship on the individual.
       4.4.2.3. The Privacy Act requires that we ultimately ensure that the subject receives the
       records.
   4.4.3. Third Party Information in a Privacy Act System of Record. Ordinarily a person
   is entitled to their entire record under the Privacy Act. However, the law is not uniform
   regarding whether a subject is entitled to information that is not ―about‖ him or her (for
   example, the home address of a third party contained in the subject‘s records). Consult your
   servicing SJA before disclosing third party information. Generally, if the requester will be
 16                                 AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011


   denied a right, privilege or benefit, the requester must be given access to relevant portions of
   the file.
   4.4.4. Information Compiled in Anticipation of Civil Action. Withhold records compiled
   in connection with a civil action or other proceeding including any action where the Air
   Force expects judicial or administrative adjudicatory proceedings. This exemption does not
   cover criminal actions. Do not release attorney work products prepared before, during, or
   after the action or proceeding.
4.5. Denial Authorities. These officials or a designee may deny access or amendment of
records as authorized by the Privacy Act. Send a letter to AF-CIO/P with the position titles of
designees. Authorities are:
   4.5.1. DCSs and chiefs of comparable offices or higher level at SAF or HQ USAF or
   designees.
   4.5.2. MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU commanders or designees.
   4.5.3. HQ USAF/DPF, 1040 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1040 (for civilian
   personnel records).
   4.5.4. Commander, Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI), Washington DC
   20332-6001 (for AFOSI records).
   4.5.5. Unified Commanders or designees.
AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011                                                     17


                                           Chapter 5

                                AMENDING THE RECORD

5.1. Amendment Reasons. Individuals may ask to have their records amended to make them
accurate, timely, relevant, or complete. System managers will routinely correct a record if the
requester can show that it is factually wrong (e.g., date of birth is wrong).
5.2. Responding to Amendment Requests.
   5.2.1. Anyone may request minor corrections orally. Requests for more serious
   modifications should be in writing.
   5.2.2. After verifying the identity of the requester, make the change, notify all known
   recipients of the record, and inform the individual.
   5.2.3. Acknowledge requests within 10 workdays of receipt. Give an expected completion
   date unless you complete the change within that time. Final decisions must take no longer
   than 30 workdays.
5.3. Approving or Denying a Record Amendment. The Air Force does not usually amend a
record when the change is based on opinion, interpretation, or subjective official judgment.
Determinations not to amend such records constitutes a denial, and requesters may appeal (see
Chapter 6).
   5.3.1. If the system manager decides not to amend the record, send a copy of the request, the
   record, and the recommended denial reasons to the denial authority through the legal office
   and the PA office. Legal offices will include a written legal opinion. The PA officer reviews
   the proposed denial and legal opinion and makes a recommendation to the denial authority.
   5.3.2. The denial authority sends the requester a letter with the decision. If the denial
   authority approves the request, amend the record and notify all previous recipients that it has
   been changed. If the authority denies the request, give the requester the statutory authority,
   reason, and pertinent appeal rights (see Chapter 6).
5.4. Seeking Review of Unfavorable Agency Determinations. Requesters should pursue
record corrections of subjective matters and opinions through proper channels to the Civilian
Personnel Office using grievance procedures or the Air Force Board for Correction of Military
Records (AFBCMR). Record correction requests denied by the AFBCMR are not subject to
further consideration under this instruction. Military personnel, other than USAF personnel,
should pursue service-unique record corrections through their component chain of command.
5.5. Contents of PA Case Files. Do not keep copies of disputed records in this file. File
disputed records in their appropriate series. Use the file solely for statistics and to process
requests. Do not use the case files to make any kind of determination about an individual.
Document reasons for untimely responses. These files include:
   5.5.1. Requests from and replies to individuals on whether a system has records about them.
   5.5.2. Requests for access or amendment.
   5.5.3. Approvals, denials, appeals, and final review actions.
   5.5.4. Coordination actions and related papers.

                                               APPEALS

6.1. Appeal Procedures. Individuals who receive a denial to their access or amendment request
may request a denial review by writing to the Secretary of the Air Force, through the denial
authority, within 60 calendar days after receiving a denial letter. The denial authority promptly
sends a complete appeal package to AFLSA/JACL. The package must include: (1) the original
appeal letter; (2) the initial request; (3) the initial denial; (4) a copy of the record; (5) any internal
records or coordination actions relating to the denial; (6) the denial authority‘s comments on the
appellant‘s arguments; and (7) the legal reviews.
    6.1.1. If the denial authority reverses an earlier denial and grants access or amendment,
    notify the requester immediately.
    6.1.2. AFLSA/JACL reviews the denial and provides a final recommendation to SAF/GCA.
    SAF/GCA tells the requester the final Air Force decision and explains judicial review rights.
    6.1.3. The requester may file a concise statement of disagreement with the system manager
    if SAF/GCA denies the request to amend the record. SAF/GCA explains the requester‘s
    rights when they issue the final appeal decision.
    6.1.4. The records should clearly show that a statement of disagreement is filed with the
    record or separately.
    6.1.5. The disputed part of the record must show that the requester filed a statement of
    disagreement.
    6.1.6. Give copies of the statement of disagreement to the record‘s previous recipients.
    Inform subsequent record users about the dispute and give them a copy of the statement with
    the record.
    6.1.7. The system manager may include a brief summary of the reasons for not amending the
    record. Limit the summary to the reasons SAF/GCA gave to the individual. The summary is
    part of the individual‘s record, but it is not subject to amendment procedures.

                                           Chapter 7

                              PRIVACY ACT NOTIFICATIONS

7.1. When To Include a Privacy Act Warning Statement in Publications. Include a PA
Warning Statement in each Air Force publication that requires collecting or keeping information
in a system of records. Also include the Warning Statement when publications direct collection
of the SSN, or any part of the SSN, from the individual. The warning statement will cite legal
authority and when part of a record system, the PA system of records number and title. You can
use the following warning statement: ―This instruction requires collecting and maintaining
information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 authorized by (U.S.C. citation and or Executive
Order number). System of records notice (number and title) applies.‖
7.1. (TYNDALLAFB)Coordinate all base publications and all forms through the base
Privacy Act Officer. Coordinate all unit publications through the unit Privacy Act Monitor.
Include the Privacy Act system of record title and number in the first paragraph of the regulation
below the heading if the regulation requires the collection of Privacy Act information. The link
to the Privacy Act system of record titles and numbers can be found in paragraph 7.5. All
publications must include the following statement in the first paragraph of the regulation below
the heading:

―Maintain records created as a result of prescribed processes IAW AFMAN 33-363,
Management of Records, and dispose of them IAW the AF Records Disposition Schedule
available from the AF-Portal link.‖
7.2. Warning Banners. Information systems that contain information on individuals that is
retrieved by name or personal identifier are subject to the Privacy Act. The Privacy Act requires
these systems to have a PA system notice published in the Federal Register that covers the
information collection before collection begins. In addition, all information systems subject to
the Privacy Act will have warning banners displayed on the first screen (at a minimum) to assist
in safeguarding the information. Use the following language for the banner: ―PRIVACY ACT
INFORMATION - The information accessed through this system is FOR OFFICIAL USE
ONLY and must be protected in accordance with the Privacy Act and AFI 33-332.‖
7.3. Sending Personal Information Over Electronic Mail. Exercise caution before
transmitting personal information over e-mail to ensure it is adequately safeguarded. Some
information may be so sensitive and personal that e-mail may not be the proper way to transmit
it. When sending personal information over e-mail within DOD, ensure: (1) there is an official
need; (2) all addressee(s) (including ―cc‖ addressees) are authorized to receive it under the
Privacy Act; and (3) it is protected from unauthorized disclosure, loss, or alteration. Protection
methods may include encryption or password protecting the information in a separate Word
document. When transmitting personal information over e-mail, add ―FOUO‖ to the beginning of
the subject line, followed by the subject, and apply the following statement at the beginning of
the e-mail:
―This e-mail contains FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO) information which must                      be
protected under the Privacy Act and AFI 33-332.‖
 20                                   AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011


Do not indiscriminately apply this statement to e-mails. Use it only in situations when you are
actually transmitting personal information. DoD Regulation 5400.7/AF Supp, Chapter 4,
provides additional guidance regarding FOUO information.
7.3. (TYNDALLAFB)Email. Privacy Act material may be emailed; however the email must
include the correct Privacy Act Statement (PAS). Additional examples of Privacy Act Statements
can be found on the Records Management Community of Practice in the Privacy Act section. Do
not indiscriminately attach Privacy Act Statements to signature blocks when sending emails.
Privacy Act Statements should only be applied to emails that contain Privacy Act Information.
All emails that contain personal privacy act information must state FOUO followed by the
subject and the beginning of the email must state:
―This e-mail contains FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO) information which must be
protected under the Privacy Act of 1974 and AFI 33-332. Do not release outside of DoD
channels without the consent of the originator‘s office. If you received this message in error,
please notify the sender by reply e-mail and delete all copies of message.‖
   7.3.1. Do not disclose personal information to anyone outside DOD unless specifically
   authorized by the Privacy Act (see paragraph 12.4).
   7.3.2. Do not send PA information to distribution lists or group e-mail addresses unless each
   member has an official need to know the personal information. When in doubt, send only to
   individual accounts.
   7.3.3. Before forwarding e-mails you have received that contain personal information, verify
   that your intended recipients are authorized to receive the information under the Privacy Act
   (see paragraph 12.4).
7.4. (Added-TYNDALLAFB) Fax. Privacy Act and other FOUO material may be sent by fax;
however, you must contact the recipient to ensure that they are at the fax location to receive the
material being sent. The first page of any Privacy Act material being sent via fax will be an AF
Form 3535, Facsimile Electro Mail Transmittal. Ensure that Section I ―For Official Use Only‖
block is checked and the following statement is entered in the ―Remarks‖ block:
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY This document contains information exempt from mandatory
disclosure under the FOIA. Exemption 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6) applies. This document also contains
personal information that is protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 and must be safeguarded from
unauthorized disclosure.
7.5. (Added-TYNDALLAFB) Forms. All forms being coordinated for publication will be
coordinated through the base Privacy Act Officer. Ensure a Privacy Act statement is on each
proposed form that requires the collection of personal information from members. Include the
Privacy Act system of record title and number on the Form. Privacy Act system of record titles
and numbers can be found at http://www.defenselink.mil/privacy/notices/.
7.6. (Added-TYNDALLAFB) Other Records. Correspondence/rosters/printouts containing
Privacy Act data, e.g., letters/ memorandums, recall rosters, personnel rosters, alpha rosters, etc.,
must be labeled with a caveat to advise individuals of the presence of personal information and
the need for proper handling (even though the records are not retrieved by a personal identifier).
These documents will be marked:
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY This document contains information exempt from mandatory
AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011                                                 21


disclosure under the FOIA. Exemption 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6) applies. This document also contains
personal information that is protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 and must be safeguarded from
unauthorized disclosure.

                                           Chapter 8

                            PRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

8.1. Evaluating Information Systems for Privacy Act Compliance. Information system
owners and developers must address PA requirements in the development stage of the system
and integrate privacy protections into the development life cycle of the information system. This
is accomplished with a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA).
   8.1.1. The PIA addresses what information is to be collected; why the information is being
   collected; the intended use of the information; with whom the information will be shared;
   what notice or opportunities for the individual to decline or consent to providing the
   information collected, and how that information is shared; secured; and whether a system of
   records is being created, or an existing system is being amended. The E-Government Act of
   2002 requires PIAs to be conducted before:
       8.1.1.1. Developing or procuring information technology (IT) systems or projects that
       collect, maintain, or disseminate information in identifiable form from or about members
       of the public.
       8.1.1.2. Initiating a new electronic collection of information, in identifiable form for 10
       or more persons excluding agencies, instrumentalities, or employees of the Federal
       Government.
   8.1.2. In general, Privacy Impact Assessments are required to be performed and updated as
   necessary where a system change creates new privacy risks.
   8.1.3. No Privacy Impact Assessment is required where information relates to internal
   government operations, has been previously assessed under an evaluation similar to a Privacy
   Impact Assessment, or where privacy issues are unchanged.
   8.1.4. The depth and content of the Privacy Impact Assessment should be appropriate for the
   nature of the information to be collected and the size and complexity of the information
   technology system.
8.2. The system owner will conduct a PIA as outlined in Attachment 4 and send it to their
MAJCOM Privacy Act office for review and final approval by the MAJCOM or HAF Functional
CIO. The MAJCOM or HAF Functional CIO will send a copy of the approved PIAs to AF-
CIO/P,1155 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1155; or e-mail
mailto:af.foia@pentagon.af.mil.
8.3. Whenever practicable, approved PIAs will be posted to the FOIA/Privacy Act Web site for
public access at http://www.foia.af.mil (this requirement will be waived for security reasons, or
to protect classified, sensitive, or private information contained in an assessment).
AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011                                                   23


                                           Chapter 9

      PREPARING AND PUBLISHING SYSTEM NOTICES FOR THE FEDERAL
                             REGISTER

9.1. Publishing System Notices. The Air Force must publish notices in the Federal Register of
new, changed, and deleted systems to inform the public of what records the Air Force keeps and
give them an opportunity to comment before the system is implemented or changed. The PA also
requires submission of new or significantly changed systems to the OMB and both houses of
Congress before publication in the Federal Register. This includes:
   9.1.1. Starting a new system.
   9.1.2. Instituting significant changes to an existing system.
   9.1.3. Sending out data collection forms or instructions.
   9.1.4. Issuing a request for proposal or invitation for bid to support a new system.
9.2. Submitting Notices for Publication in the Federal Register. At least 120 days before
implementing a new system, or a major change to an existing system, subject to this instruction,
system managers must send a proposed notice, through the MAJCOM Privacy Office, to AF-
CIO/P. Send notices electronically to mailto:af.foia@pentagon.af.mil using Microsoft Word,
using the Track Changes tool in Word to indicate additions/changes to existing notices. Follow
the format outlined in Attachment 2. For new systems, system managers must include a
statement that a risk assessment was accomplished and is available should the OMB request it.
9.3. Reviewing Notices. System managers will review and validate their PA system notices
annually and submit changes to AF-CIO/P through the MAJCOM Privacy Office.

                                          Chapter 10

                      PROTECTING AND DISPOSING OF RECORDS

10.1. Protecting Records. Maintaining information privacy is the responsibility of every
federal employee, military member, and contractor who comes into contact with information in
identifiable form. Protect information according to its sensitivity level. Consider the personal
sensitivity of the information and the risk of disclosure, loss or alteration. Most information in
systems of records is FOUO. Refer to DoD 5400.7-R/AF Supp, DoD Freedom of Information
Act Program, for protection methods.
10.2. Balancing Protection. Balance additional protection against sensitivity, risk and cost. In
some situations, a password may be enough protection for an automated system with a log-on
protocol. Others may require more sophisticated security protection based on the sensitivity of
the information. Classified computer systems or those with established audit and password
systems are obviously less vulnerable than unprotected files. Follow AFI 33-202, Computer
Security, for procedures on safeguarding personal information in automated records.
   10.2.1. AF Form 3227, Privacy Act Cover Sheet , is optional and available for use with
   Privacy Act material. Use it to cover and protect personal information that you are using in
   office environments that are widely unprotected and accessible to many individuals. After
   use, such information should be protected as outlined in DoD 5400.7-R/AF Supp.
   10.2.2. Privacy Act Labels. Use of AFVA 33-276, Privacy Act Label, is optional to assist in
   protecting Privacy Act information on compact disks, diskettes, and tapes.
10.3. Disposing of Records. You may use the following methods to dispose of records
protected by the Privacy Act and authorized for destruction according to records retention
schedules:
   10.3.1. Destroy by any method that prevents compromise, such as tearing, burning, or
   shredding, so long as the personal data is not recognizable and beyond reconstruction.
   10.3.2. Degauss or overwrite magnetic tapes or other magnetic medium.
   10.3.3. Dispose of paper products through the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office or
   through activities that manage a base-wide recycling program. The recycling sales contract
   must contain a clause requiring the contractor to safeguard privacy material until its
   destruction and to pulp, macerate, shred, or otherwise completely destroy the records.
   Originators must safeguard PA material until it is transferred to the recycling contractor. A
   Federal employee or, if authorized, a contractor employee must witness the destruction. This
   transfer does not require a disclosure accounting.
   10.3.3. (TYNDALLAFB) Shredding is the preferred method of destruction. If a shredder is
   not available, this material may also be torn into small pieces so that it is impossible to
   reassemble. Once shredded, material may be bagged in clear bags and left next to the
   recycling bins. Do not place unshredded privacy act or FOUO documents in blue recycle
   bins. All privacy act and FOUO documents must be shredded and placed in garbage bins.
AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011                                                    25


                                          Chapter 11

                              PRIVACY ACT EXEMPTIONS

11.1. Exemption Types. There are two types of exemptions permitted by 5 U.S.C. 552a:
   11.1.1. A General exemption authorizes the exemption of a system of records from most
   parts of the PA.
   11.1.2. A Specific exemption authorizes the exemption of a system of records from only a
   few parts.
11.2. Authorizing Exemptions. Denial authorities may withhold records using Privacy Act
exemptions only when an exemption for the system of records has been published in the Federal
Register as a final rule. Attachment 3 lists the systems of records that have published
exemptions with rationale.
11.3. Requesting an Exemption. A system manager who believes that a system needs an
exemption from some or all of the requirements of the PA will send a request to AF-CIO/P
through the MAJCOM or FOA PA Officer. The request will detail the reasons for the exemption,
the section of the Act that allows the exemption, and the specific subsections of the PA from
which the system is to be exempted, with justification for each subsection.
11.4. Exemptions. Exemptions permissible under 5 U.S.C. 552a (subject to paragraph 11.2):
   11.4.1. The (j)(2) exemption. Applies to investigative records created and maintained by
   law-enforcement activities whose principal function is criminal law enforcement.
   11.4.2. The (k)(1) exemption. Applies to information specifically authorized to be classified
   according to DoD 5200.1R, Information Security Program.
   11.4.3. The (k)(2) exemption. Applies to investigatory information compiled for law-
   enforcement purposes by nonlaw enforcement activities and which is not within the scope of
   the (j)(2) exemption (paragraph 11.4.1). However, the Air Force must allow an individual
   access to any record that is used to deny rights, privileges or benefits to which he or she
   would otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he or she would otherwise be
   eligible as a result of the maintenance of the information (unless doing so would reveal a
   confidential source).
   11.4.4. The (k)(3) exemption. Applies to records maintained in connection with providing
   protective services to the President and other individuals under Title 18, U.S.C., Section
   3506.
   11.4.5. The (k)(4) exemption. Applies to records maintained solely for statistical research or
   program evaluation purposes and which are not used to make decisions on the rights,
   benefits, or entitlement of an individual except for census records which may be disclosed
   under Title 13, U.S.C., Section 8.
   11.4.6. The (k)(5) exemption. Applies to investigatory material compiled solely for the
   purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal civilian
   employment, military service, federal contracts, or access to classified information, but only
   to the extent such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source. This provision
26                                 AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011


  allows protection of confidential sources used in background investigations, employment
  inquiries, and similar inquiries that are for personnel screening to determine suitability,
  eligibility, or qualifications.
  11.4.7. The (k)(6) exemption. Applies to testing or examination material used solely to
  determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the federal or military
  service, if the disclosure would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the test or
  examination process.
  11.4.8. The (k)(7) exemption. Applies to evaluation material used to determine potential for
  promotion in the Military Services, but only to the extent that the disclosure of such material
  would reveal the identity of a confidential source.
AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011                                                       27


                                           Chapter 12

                       DISCLOSING RECORDS TO THIRD PARTIES

12.1. Disclosure Considerations. The Privacy Act requires the written consent of the subject
before releasing personal information to third parties, unless one of the 12 exceptions of the
Privacy Act applies (see paragraph 12.4). Use this checklist before releasing personal
information to third parties: (1) make sure it is authorized under the Privacy Act; (2) consider the
consequences; and (3) check the accuracy of the information. You can release personal
information to third parties when the subject agrees in writing. Air Force members consent to
releasing their home telephone number and address when they sign and check the ―Do Consent‖
block on the AF Form 624, Base/Unit Locator and PSC Directory (see AFI 33-329, Base and
Unit Personnel Locators).
   12.1.1. Social Rosters. Before including personal information such as spouses names, home
   addresses, home phones, and similar information on social rosters or directories that are
   shared with groups of individuals, ask for signed consent statements. Otherwise, do not
   include the information. Consent statements must give the individual a choice to consent or
   not consent, and clearly tell the individual what information is being solicited, the purpose, to
   whom you plan to disclose the information, and that consent is voluntary. Maintain the
   signed statements until no longer needed.
   12.1.1. (TYNDALLAFB) Use TYNDALLAFB57, Statement of Consent for Inclusion in
   Social Roster, to document consent.
   12.1.2. Placing Personal Information on Shared Drives. Personal information should
   never be placed on shared drives for access by groups of individuals unless each person has
   an official need to know the information to perform their job. Add appropriate access
   controls to ensure access by only authorized individuals. Recall rosters are FOUO because
   they contain personal information and should be shared with small groups at the lowest levels
   for official purposes to reduce the number of people with access to such personal
   information. Commanders and supervisors should give consideration to those individuals
   with unlisted phone numbers, who do not want their number included on the office recall
   roster. In those instances, disclosure to the Commander or immediate supervisor, or deputy,
   should normally be sufficient.
   12.1.3. Personal Information That Requires Protection. Following are some examples of
   information that is not releasable without the written consent of the subject. This list is not
   all-inclusive.
       12.1.3.1. Marital status (single, divorced, widowed, separated).
       12.1.3.2. Number, name, and sex of dependents.
       12.1.3.3. Civilian educational degrees and major areas of study (unless the request for
       the information relates to the professional qualifications for Federal employment).
       12.1.3.4. School and year of graduation.
       12.1.3.5. Home of record.
       12.1.3.6. Home address and phone.

       12.1.3.7. Age and date of birth (year).
       12.1.3.8. Present or future assignments for overseas or for routinely deployable or
       sensitive units.
       12.1.3.9. Office and unit address and duty phone for overseas or for routinely deployable
       or sensitive units.
       12.1.3.10. Race/ethnic origin
       12.1.3.11. Educational level (unless the request for the information relates to the
       professional qualifications for Federal employment).
       12.1.3.12. Social Security Number.
12.2. Releasable Information. Following are examples of information normally releasable to
the public without the written consent of the subject. This list is not all-inclusive.
   12.2.1. Name.
   12.2.2. Rank.
   12.2.3. Grade.
   12.2.4. Air Force specialty code.
   12.2.5. Pay (including base pay, special pay, all allowances except Basic Allowance for
   Quarters and Variable Housing Allowance).
   12.2.6. Gross salary for civilians.
   12.2.7. Past duty assignments, unless sensitive or classified.
   12.2.8. Present and future approved and announced stateside assignments.
   12.2.9. Position title.
   12.2.10. Office, unit address, and duty phone number (CONUS only).
   12.2.11. Date of rank.
   12.2.12. Entered on active duty date.
   12.2.13. Pay date.
   12.2.14. Source of commission.
   12.2.15. Professional military education.
   12.2.16. Promotion sequence number.
   12.2.17. Military awards and decorations.
   12.2.18. Duty status of active, retired, or reserve.
   12.2.19. Active duty official attendance at technical, scientific, or professional meetings.

12.3. Disclosing Other Information. Use these guidelines to decide whether to release
information:
   12.3.1. Would the subject have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information
   requested?
   12.3.2. Would disclosing the information benefit the general public? The Air Force
   considers information as meeting the public interest standard if it reveals anything regarding
   the operations or activities of the agency, or performance of its statutory duties.
   12.3.3. Balance the public interest against the individual‘s probable loss of privacy. Do not
   consider the requester‘s purpose, circumstances, or proposed use.
12.4. Rules for Releasing Privacy Act Information Without Consent of the Subject. The
Privacy Act prohibits disclosing personal information to anyone other than the subject of the
record without his or her written consent. There are twelve exceptions to the ―no disclosure
without consent‖ rule. Those exceptions permit release of personal information without the
individual‘s consent only in the following instances:
   12.4.1. Exception 1. DOD employees who have a need to know the information in the
   performance of their official duties.
   12.4.2. Exception 2. In response to a FOIA request for information contained in a system of
   records about an individual and the FOIA requires release of the information.
   12.4.3. Exception 3. To agencies outside DOD, only for a Routine Use published in the
   Federal Register. The purpose of the disclosure must be compatible with the intended
   purpose of collecting and maintaining the record. When initially collecting the information
   from the subject, the Routine Uses block in the Privacy Act Statement must name the
   agencies and reason.
       12.4.3.1. In addition to the Routine Uses established by the Department of the Air Force
       within each system of records, the DOD has established ―Blanket Routine Uses‖ that
       apply to all record systems maintained by the Department of the Air Force. These
       ―Blanket Routine Uses‖ have been published only once at the beginning of the
       Department of the Air Force‘s Federal Register compilation of record systems notices in
       the interest of simplicity, economy and to avoid redundancy. Unless a system notice
       specifically excludes a system of records from a ―Blanket Routine Use,‖ all ―Blanket
       Routine Uses‖ apply to that system (see Attachment 5).
   12.4.4. Exception 4. The Bureau of the Census to plan or carry out a census or survey under
   Title 13, U.S.C. Section 8.
   12.4.5. Exception 5. A recipient for statistical research or reporting. The recipient must give
   advanced written assurance that the information is for statistical purposes only. NOTE: No
   one may use any part of the record to decide on individuals‘ rights, benefits, or entitlements.
   You must release records in a format that makes it impossible to identify the real subjects.
   12.4.6. Exception 6. The National Archives and Records Administration to evaluate records
   for permanent retention. Records stored in Federal Records Centers remain under Air Force
   control.
 30                                  AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011


   12.4.7. Exception 7. A Federal, State, or local agency (other than DOD) for civil or criminal
   law enforcement. The head of the agency or a designee must send a written request to the
   system manager specifying the record or part needed and the law enforcement purpose. In
   addition, the ‗blanket routine use‘ for law enforcement allows the system manager to disclose
   a record to a law enforcement agency if the agency suspects a criminal violation.
   12.4.8. Exception 8. An individual or agency that needs the information for compelling
   health or safety reasons. The affected individual need not be the record subject.
   12.4.9. Exception 9. Either House of Congress, a congressional committee, or a
   subcommittee, for matters within their jurisdictions. The request must come from the
   committee chairman or ranking minority member (see AFI 90-401).
       12.4.9.1. Requests from a Congressional member acting on behalf of the record subject
       are evaluated under the routine use of the applicable system notice. If the material for
       release is sensitive, get a release statement.
       12.4.9.2. Requests from a Congressional member not on behalf of a committee or the
       record subject are properly analyzed under the FOIA, and not under the PA.
   12.4.10. Exception 10. The Comptroller General or an authorized representative of the
   General Accounting Office (GAO) to conduct official GAO business.
   12.4.11. Exception 11. A court of competent jurisdiction, with a court order signed by a
   judge.
   12.4.12. Exception 12. A consumer reporting agency in accordance with Title 31 U.S.C.
   Section 3711(e). Ensure category element is represented within the system of records notice.
12.5. Disclosing the Medical Records of Minors. Air Force personnel may disclose the
medical records of minors to their parents or legal guardians in conjunction with applicable
Federal laws and guidelines. The laws of each state define the age of majority.
   12.5.1. The Air Force must obey state laws protecting medical records of drug or alcohol
   abuse treatment, abortion, and birth control. If you manage medical records, learn the local
   laws and coordinate proposed local policies with the servicing SJA.
   12.5.2. Outside the United States (overseas), the age of majority is 18. Unless parents or
   guardians have a court order granting access or the minor‘s written consent, they will not
   have access to minor‘s medical records overseas when the minor sought or consented to
   treatment between the ages of 15 and 17 in a program where regulation or statute provides
   confidentiality of records and he or she asked for confidentiality.
12.6. Disclosure Accountings. System managers must keep an accurate record of all
disclosures made from any system of records except disclosures to DOD personnel for official
use or disclosures under the FOIA. System managers may use AF Form 771, Accounting of
Disclosures. Retain disclosure accountings for 5 years after the disclosure, or for the life of the
record, whichever is longer.
   12.6.1. System managers may file the accounting record any way they want as long as they
   give it to the subject on request, send corrected or disputed information to previous record
   recipients, explain any disclosures, and provide an audit trail for reviews. Include in each
   accounting:
AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011                                                   31


       12.6.1.1. Release date.
       12.6.1.2. Description of information.
       12.6.1.3. Reason for release.
       12.6.1.4. Name and address of recipient.
   12.6.2. Some exempt systems let you withhold the accounting record from the subject.
   12.6.3. You may withhold information about disclosure accountings for law enforcement
   purposes at the law enforcement agency‘s request.
12.7. Computer Matching. Computer matching programs electronically compare records from
two or more automated systems that may include DOD, another Federal agency, or a state or
other local government. A system manager proposing a match that could result in an adverse
action against a Federal employee must meet these requirements of the PA: (1) prepare a written
agreement between participants; (2) secure approval of the Defense Data Integrity Board; (3)
publish a matching notice in the Federal Register before matching begins; (4) ensure full
investigation and due process; and (5) act on the information, as necessary.
   12.7.1. The PA applies to matching programs that use records from: Federal personnel or
   payroll systems and Federal benefit programs where matching: (1) determines Federal
   benefit eligibility; (2) checks on compliance with benefit program requirements; (3) recovers
   improper payments or delinquent debts from current or former beneficiaries.
   12.7.2. Matches used for statistics, pilot programs, law enforcement, tax administration,
   routine administration, background checks and foreign counterintelligence, and internal
   matching that won‘t cause any adverse action are exempt from PA matching requirements.
   12.7.3. Any activity that expects to participate in a matching program must contact AF-
   CIO/P immediately. System managers must prepare a notice for publication in the Federal
   Register with a Routine Use that allows disclosing the information for use in a matching
   program. Send the proposed system notice to AF-CIO/P. Allow 180 days for processing
   requests for a new matching program.
   12.7.4. Record subjects must receive prior notice of a match. The best way to do this is to
   include notice in the Privacy Act Statement on forms used in applying for benefits.
   Coordinate computer matching statements on forms with AF-CIO/P through the MAJCOM
   PA Officer.
12.8. Privacy and the Web. Do not post personal information on publicly accessible DOD web
sites unless clearly authorized by law and implementing regulation and policy. Additionally, do
not post personal information on .mil private web sites unless authorized by the local
commander, for official purposes, and an appropriate risk assessment is performed. See AFI 33-
129 Transmission of Information Via the Internet.
   12.8.1. Ensure public Web sites comply with privacy policies regarding restrictions on
   persistent and third party cookies, and add appropriate privacy and security notices at major
   web site entry points and Privacy Act statements or Privacy Advisories when collecting
   personal information. Notices must clearly explain where the collection or sharing of certain
   information is voluntary, and notify users how to provide consent.
32                                 AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011


  12.8.2. Include a Privacy Act Statement on the web page if it collects information directly
  from an individual that we maintain and retrieve by his or her name or personal identifier
  (i.e., SSN). We may only maintain such information in approved PA systems of records that
  are published in the Federal Register. Inform the visitor when the information is maintained
  and retrieved by name or personal identifier in a system of records; that the Privacy Act gives
  them certain rights with respect to the government‘s maintenance and use of information
  collected about them, and provide a link to the Air Force Privacy Act policy and system
  notices at http://www.foia.af.mil.
  12.8.3. Anytime a web site solicits personally-identifying information, even when not
  maintained in a PA system of records, it requires a Privacy Advisory. The Privacy Advisory
  informs the individual why the information is solicited and how it will be used. Post the
  Privacy Advisory to the web page where the information is being solicited, or through a well-
  marked hyperlink ―Privacy Advisory - Please refer to the Privacy and Security Notice that
  describes why this information is collected and how it will be used.‖

of an actual or potential violation will not be alerted to the investigation; the physical safety of
witnesses, informants, and law enforcement personnel will not be endangered, the privacy of
third parties will not be violated; and that the disclosure would not otherwise impede effective
law enforcement. Whenever possible, information of the above nature will be deleted from the
requested documents and the balance made available. The controlling principle behind this
limited access is to allow disclosures except those indicated above. The decisions to release
information from these systems will be made on a case-by-case basis.
A3.5. General Exemption. The following systems of records claim an exemption under Title 5
U.S.C., Section 552a(j)(2), with the exception of F090 AF IG B, Inspector General Records and
F051 AF JA F, Courts-Martial and Article 15 Records. They claim both the (j)(2) and (k)(2)
exemption, and are listed under this part:
   A3.5.1. System identifier and name: F071 AF OSI A, Counter Intelligence Operations and
   Collection Records.
   A3.5.2. System identifier and name: F071 AF OSI C, Criminal Records.
   A3.5.3. System identifier and name: F071 AF OSI D, Investigative Support Records.
   A3.5.4. System identifier and name: F031 AF SP E, Security Forces Management
   Information System (SFMIS).
                 (i) Exemption: Parts of this system may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2)
if information is compiled and maintained by a component of the agency which performs as its
principle function any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws. Therefore,
portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from the
following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (c)(4), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), and (I),
(e)(5), (e)(8), (f), and (g).

               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).
               (iii) Reasons: (A) To protect ongoing investigations and to protect from access
criminal investigation information contained in this record system, so as not to jeopardize any
subsequent judicial or administrative process taken as a result of information contained in the
file.
                               (B) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the disclosure
accounting, for disclosures pursuant to the routine uses published for this system, would permit
the subject criminal investigation or matter under investigation to obtain valuable information
concerning the nature of that investigation which will present a serious impediment to law
enforcement.
                               (C) From subsection (c)(4) because an exemption is being claimed
for subsection this subsection will not be applicable.
                               (D) From subsection (d) because access the records contained in
this system would inform the subject of an investigation of existence of that investigation,
provide subject of the investigation with information that might enable him to avoid detection,
and would present a serious impediment to law enforcement.
                             (E) From subsection (e)(4)(H) because system of records is exempt
from individual access pursuant to subsection (j) of the Privacy Act of 1974.
                            (F) From subsection (f) because this system of records has been
exempted from access provisions of subsection (d).
   A3.5.5. System identifier and name: F031 AF SF A, Correction and Rehabilitation Records.
                (i) Exemption: Parts of this system may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2)
if information is compiled and maintained by a component of the agency which performs as its
principle function any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws. Portions of this
system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) from the following subsections
of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (c)(4), (d), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), (e)(5), (e)(8), (f), and (g).
               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).
                (iii) Reasons: (A) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the disclosure
accounting, for disclosures pursuant to the routine uses published for this system, would permit
the subject of a criminal investigation or matter under investigation to obtain valuable
information concerning the nature of that investigation which will present a serious impediment
to law enforcement.
                               (B) From subsection (c)(4) because an exemption is being claimed
for subsection (d), this subsection will not be applicable.
                               (C) From subsection (d) because access to the records contained in
this system would inform the subject of a criminal investigation of the existence of that
investigation, provide the subject of the investigation with information that might enable him to
avoid detection or apprehension, and would present a serious impediment to law enforcement.
                               (D) From subsection (e)(3) would constitute a serious impediment
to law enforcement in that it could compromise the existence of a confidential investigation,
AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011                                                         43


reveal the identity of confidential sources of information and endanger the life and physical
safety of confidential informants.
                             (E) From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H) because this system of
records is exempt from individual access pursuant to subsections (j)(2) of the Privacy Act of
1974.
                              (F) From subsection (e)(4)(I) because the identity of specific
sources must be withheld in order to protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal and
other law enforcement information. This exemption is further necessary to protect the privacy
and physical safety of witnesses and informants.
                                (G) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information
for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance what information is
accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or
untimely information may acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to
light and the accuracy of such information can only be determined in a court of law. The
restrictions of subsection (e)(5) would restrict the ability of trained investigators and intelligence
analysts to exercise their judgment reporting on investigations and impede the development of
intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement.
                                (H) From subsection (e)(8) because the individual notice
requirements of subsection (e)(8) could present a serious impediment to law enforcement as this
could interfere with the ability to issue search authorizations and could reveal investigative
techniques and procedures.
                            (I) From subsection (f) because this system of records has been
exempted from the access provisions of subsection (d).
                            (J) From subsection (g) because this system of records compiled
for law enforcement purposes and has been exempted from the access provisions of subsections
(d) and (f).
   A3.5.6. System identifier and name: F090 AF IG B, Inspector General Records.
                (i) Exemption: (A) Parts of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5
U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) if the information is compiled and maintained by a component of the agency
which performs as its principle function any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal
laws. Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
552a(j)(2) from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (c)(4), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3),
(e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), (e)(5), (e)(8), (f), and (g).
                                (B) Investigative material compiled for law enforcement purposes,
other than material within the scope of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), may be exempt pursuant
to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). However, if an individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit for
which he would otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he would otherwise be
eligible, as a result of the maintenance of the information, the individual will be provided access
to the information exempt to the extent that disclosure would reveal the identity of a confidential
source. NOTE: When claimed, this exemption allows limited protection of investigative reports
maintained in a system of records used in personnel or administrative actions. Therefore,
 44                                   AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011


portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) from the
following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and (f).
               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and (k)(2).
               (iii) Reasons: (A) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of accounting of
disclosure would inform a subject that he or she is under investigation. This information would
provide considerable advantage to the subject in providing him or her with knowledge
concerning the nature of the investigation and the coordinated investigative efforts and
techniques employed by the cooperating agencies. This would greatly impede the Air Force IG‘s
criminal law enforcement.
                                 (B) From subsection (c)(4) and (d), because notification would
alert a subject to the fact that an open investigation on that individual is taking place, and might
weaken the on going investigation, reveal investigative techniques, and place confidential
informants in jeopardy.
                                (C) From subsection (e)(1) because the nature of the criminal
and/or civil investigative function creates unique problems in prescribing a specific parameter in
a particular case with respect to what information is relevant or necessary. Also, information may
be received which may relate to a case under the investigative jurisdiction of another agency.
The maintenance of this information may be necessary to provide leads for appropriate law
enforcement purposes and to establish patterns of activity that may relate to the jurisdiction of
other cooperating agencies.
                                (D) From subsection (e)(2) because collecting information to the
fullest extent possible directly from the subject individual may or may not be practical in a
criminal and/or civil investigation.
                              (E) From subsection (e)(3) because supplying an individual with a
form containing a Privacy Act Statement would tend to inhibit cooperation by many individuals
involved in a criminal and/or civil investigation. The effect would be somewhat adverse to
established investigative methods and techniques.
                             (F) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) because this system of
records is exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d) and (f).
                               (G) From subsection (e)(5) because the requirement that records be
maintained with attention to accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness would unfairly
hamper the investigative process. It is the nature of law enforcement for investigations to
uncover the commission of illegal acts at diverse stages. It is frequently impossible to determine
initially what information is accurate, relevant, timely, and least of all complete. With the
passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may acquire new significance as
further investigation brings new details to light.
                              (H) From subsection (e)(8) because the notice requirements of this
provision could present a serious impediment to law enforcement by revealing investigative
techniques, procedures, and existence of confidential investigations.
                               (I) From subsection (f) because the agency‘s rules are inapplicable
to those portions of the system that are exempt and would place the burden on the agency of
either confirming or denying the existence of a record pertaining to a requesting individual might
AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011                                                          45


in itself provide an answer to that individual relating to an on going investigation. The conduct of
a successful investigation leading to the indictment of a criminal offender precludes the
applicability of established agency rules relating to verification of record, disclosure of the
record to that individual, and record amendment procedures for this record system.
                               (J) From subsection (g) because this system of records should be
exempt to the extent that the civil remedies relate to provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a from which this
rule exempts the system.
   A3.5.7. System identifier and name: F051 AF JA F, Courts-Martial and Article 15 Records.
                (i) Exemptions: (A) Parts of this system may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
552a(j)(2) if the information is compiled and maintained by a component of the agency which
performs as its principle function any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws.
Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2)
from the following subsection of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (c)(4), (d), (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G),
(H) and (I), (e)(5), (e)(8), (f), and (g).
                                (B) Investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes,
other than material within the scope of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), may be exempt pursuant
to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). However, if an individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit for
which he would otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he would otherwise be
eligible, as a result of the maintenance of the information, the individual will be provided access
to the information exempt to the extent that disclosure would reveal the identify of a confidential
source. NOTE: When claimed, this exemption allows limited protection of investigative reports
maintained in a system of records used in personnel or administrative actions. Therefore,
portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) from the
following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and (f).
               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and (k)(2).
                (iii) Reason: (A) From subsection (c)(3) because the release of the disclosure
accounting, for disclosures pursuant to the routine uses published for this system, would permit
the subject of a criminal investigation or matter under investigation to obtain valuable
information concerning the nature of that investigation which will present a serious impediment
to law enforcement.
                               (B) From subsection (c)(4) because an exemption is being claimed
for subsection (d), this subsection will not be applicable.
                               (C) From subsection (d) because access to the records contained in
this system would inform the subject of a criminal investigation of the existence of that
investigation, provide the subject of the investigation with information that might enable him to
avoid detection or apprehension, and would present a serious impediment to law enforcement.
                                (D) From subsection (e)(1) because in the course of criminal
investigations information is often obtained concerning the violation of laws or civil obligations
of others not relating to an active case or matter. In the interests of effective law enforcement, it
is necessary that this information be retained since it can aid in establishing patterns of activity
and provide valuable leads for other agencies and future cases that may be brought.
 46                                   AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011


                              (E) From subsection (e)(2) because in a criminal investigation the
requirement that information be collected to the greatest extent possible from the subject
individual would present a serious impediment to law enforcement in that the subject of the
investigation would be placed on notice of the existence of the investigation and would therefore
be able to avoid detection.
                               (F) From subsection (e)(3) because the requirement that
individuals supplying information be provided with a form stating the requirements of subsection
(e)(3) would constitute a serious impediment to law enforcement in that it could compromise the
existence of a confidential investigation, reveal the identity of confidential sources of
information and endanger the life and physical safety of confidential informants.
                             (G) From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H) because this system of
records is exempt from individual access pursuant to subsections (j) and (k) of the Privacy Act of
1974.
                              (H) From subsection (e)(4)(I) because the identity of specific
sources must be withheld in order to protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal and
other law enforcement information. This exemption is further necessary to protect the privacy
and physical safety of witnesses and informants.
                                (I) From subsection (e)(5) because in the collection of information
for law enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance what information is
accurate, relevant timely, and complete. With the passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or
untimely information may acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to
light and the accuracy of such information can only be determined in a court of law. The
restrictions of subsection (e)(5) would restrict the ability of trained investigators and intelligence
analysts to exercise their judgment in reporting on investigations and impede the development of
intelligence necessary for effective law enforcement.
                                (J) From subsection (e)(8) because the individual notice
requirements of subsection (e)(8) could present a serious impediment to law enforcement as this
could interfere with the ability to issue search authorizations and could reveal investigative
techniques and procedures.
                            (K) From subsection (f) because this system of records has been
exempted from the access provisions of subsection (d).
                            (L) From subsection (g) because this system of records is compiled
for law enforcement purposes and has been exempted from the access provisions of subsections
(d) and (f).
A3.6. Specific Exemptions. The following systems of records are subject to the specific
exemptions shown:
   A3.6.1. System identifier and name: F036 USAFA K, Admissions Records.
                (i) Exemption. Evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion in
the Military Services may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7), but only to the extent that
the disclosure of such material would reveal the identify of a confidential source. Therefore,
portions of this system of records (Liaison Officer Evaluation and Selection Panel Candidate
AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011                                                       47


Evaluation) may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7) from the following subsections of 5
U.S.C. 552a(d), (e)(4)(H), and (f).
               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7).
               (iii) Reasons. To ensure the frankness of information used to determine whether
cadets are qualified for graduation and commissioning as officers in the Air Force. P

   Answer Sheets.
                (i) Exemption: Testing or examination material used solely to determine
individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the federal or military service, if the
disclosure would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the test or examination process may
be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6), if the disclosure would compromise the objectivity or
fairness of the test or examination process. Therefore, portions of this system of records may be
exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3);
(d); (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I); and (f).
               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6).
               (iii) Reasons: To protect the objectivity of the promotion testing system by
keeping the test questions and answers in confidence.
   A3.6.3. System identifier and name: F036 USAFA A, Cadet Personnel Management
   System.
                (i) Exemption: Evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion in
the Military Services may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7), but only to the extent that
the disclosure of such material would reveal the identify of a confidential source. Therefore,
portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7) from the
following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), (e)(4)(H), and (f).
               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7).
               (iii) Reasons: To maintain the candor and integrity of comments needed to
evaluate an Air Force Academy cadet for commissioning in the Air Force.
   A3.6.4. System identifier and name: F036 AETC I, Cadet Records.
                (i) Exemption: Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of
determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal civilian employment, military
service, federal contracts, or access to classified information may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
552a(k)(5), but only to the extent that such material would reveal the identity of a confidential
source. Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
552a(k)(5) (Detachment Professional Officer Course Selection Rating Sheets; Air Force Reserve
Officer Training Corps Form 0–24–Disenrollment Review; Memoranda for Record and Staff
Papers with Staff Advice, Opinions, or Suggestions) may be exempt from the following
subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f).
               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).
 48                                  AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011


                (iii) Reasons: To protect the identity of a confidential source who furnishes
information necessary to make determinations about the qualifications, eligibility, and suitability
of cadets for graduation and commissioning in the Air Force.
   A3.6.5. System identifier and name: F044 AF SG Q, Family Advocacy Program Records.
                 (i) Exemption: (A) Investigative material compiled for law enforcement purposes,
other than material within the scope of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), may be exempt pursuant
to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). However, if an individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit for
which he would otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he would otherwise be
eligible, as a result of the maintenance of the information, the individual will be provided access
to the information exempt to the extent that disclosure would reveal the identify of a confidential
source. NOTE: When claimed, this exemption allows limited protection of investigative reports
maintained in a system of records used in personnel or administrative actions.
                                (B) Investigative material compiled solely for the purpose of
determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal civilian employment, military
service, federal contracts, or access to classified information may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
552a(k)(5), but only to the extent that such material would reveal the identity of a confidential
source.
                             (C) Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and (k)(5) from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3)
and (d).
               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and (k)(5).
                (iii) Reasons: From subsections (c)(3) and (d) because the exemption is needed to
encourage those who know of exceptional medical or educational conditions or family
maltreatments to come forward by protecting their identities and to protect such sources from
embarrassment or recriminations, as well as to protect their right to privacy. It is essential that
the identities of all individuals who furnish information under an express promise of
confidentiality be protected. Granting individuals access to information relating to criminal and
civil law enforcement, as well as the release of certain disclosure accounting, could interfere with
ongoing investigations and the orderly administration of justice, in that it could result in the
concealment, alteration, destruction, or fabrication of information; could hamper the
identification of offenders or alleged offenders and the disposition of charges; and could
jeopardize the safety and well being of parents and their children. Exempted portions of this
system also contain information considered relevant and necessary to make a determination as to
qualifications, eligibility, or suitability for Federal employment and Federal contracts, and that
was obtained by providing an express or implied promise to the source that his or her identity
would not be revealed to the subject of the record.
   A3.6.6. System identifier and name: F036 AF PC A, Effectiveness/Performance Reporting
   System.
               (i) Exemption: Evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion in
the Military Services (Brigadier General Selectee Effectiveness Reports and Colonel and
Lieutenant Colonel Promotion Recommendations with close out dates on or before January 31,

               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7).
               (iii) Reasons: (A) From subsection (c)(3) because making the disclosure
accounting available to the individual may compromise express promises of confidentiality by
revealing details about the report and identify other record sources, which may result in
circumvention of the access exemption.
                           (B) From subsection (d) because individual disclosure
compromises express promises of confidentiality conferred to protect the integrity of the
promotion rating system.
                              (C) From subsection (e)(4)(H) because of and to the extent that
portions of this record system are exempt from the individual access provisions of subsection (d).
                              (D) From subsection (f) because of and to the extent that portions

(f).
               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7).
               (iii) Reason: (A) From subsection (c)(3) because making the disclosure
accounting available to the individual may compromise express promises of confidentiality by
revealing details about the report and identify other record sources, which may result in
circumvention of the access exemption.

which he would otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he would otherwise be
eligible, as a result of the maintenance of the information, the individual will be provided access
to the information exempt to the extent that disclosure would reveal the identify of a confidential
source. NOTE: When claimed, this exemption allows limited protection of investigative reports
maintained in a system of records used in personnel or administrative actions.
                                (B) Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of
determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal civilian employment, military
service, federal contracts, or access to classified information may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
552a(k)(5), but only to the extent that such material would reveal the identity of a confidential
source.
                               (C) Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and (k)(5) from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C.
552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f).
               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and (k)(5).
                (iii) Reasons: To protect the identity of sources to which proper promises of
confidentiality have been made during investigations. Without these promises, sources will often
be unwilling to provide information essential in adjudicating access in a fair and impartial

service, federal contracts, or access to classified information may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
552a(k)(5), but only to the extent that such material would reveal the identity of a confidential
source. Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C.

   A3.6.17. System identifier and name: F036 AF DPG, Military Equal Opportunity and
   Treatment.
                 (i) Exemption: Investigative material compiled for law enforcement purposes,
other than material within the scope of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), may be exempt pursuant
to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). However, if an individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit for
which he would otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he would otherwise be
eligible, as a result of the maintenance of the information, the individual will be provided access
to the information exempt to the extent that disclosure would reveal the identity of a confidential
source. NOTE: When claimed, this exemption allows limited protection of investigative reports
maintained in a system of records used in personnel or administrative actions.
Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 522a(k)(2)
from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), (e)(4)(H), and (f).
               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2)
                (iii) Reasons: (A) From subsection (d) because access to the records contained in
this system would inform the subject of an investigation of the existence of that investigation,
provide the subject of the investigation with information that might enable him to avoid
detection, and would present a serious impediment to law enforcement. In addition, granting
individuals access to information collected while an Equal Opportunity and Treatment
clarification/investigation is in progress conflicts with the just, thorough, and timely completion
of the complaint, and could possibly enable individuals to interfere, obstruct, or mislead those
clarifying/investigating the complaint.
                            (B) From subsection (e)(4)(H) because this system of records is
exempt from individual access pursuant to subsection (k) of the Privacy Act of 1974.
                            (C) From subsection (f) because this system of records has been
exempted from the access provisions of subsection (d).
   A3.6.18. System identifier and name: F051 AF JA I, Commander Directed Inquiries.
                 (i) Exemption: Investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes,
other than material within the scope of subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), may be exempt pursuant
to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). However, if an individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit for
which he would otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he would otherwise be
eligible, as a result of the maintenance of the information, the individual will be provided access
to the information except to the extent that disclosure would reveal the identity of a confidential
source. NOTE: When claimed, this exemption allows limited protection of investigative reports
maintained in a system of records used in personnel or administrative actions. Any portion of this
system of records which falls within the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) may be exempt from
the following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f).
               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).
               (iii) Reasons: (A) From subsection (c)(3) because to grant access to the
accounting for each disclosure as required by the Privacy Act, including the date, nature, and
purpose of each disclosure and the identity of the recipient, could alert the subject to the
existence of the investigation. This could seriously compromise case preparation by prematurely
 54                                  AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011


revealing its existence and nature; compromise or interfere with witnesses or make witnesses
reluctant to cooperate; and lead to suppression, alteration, or destruction of evidence.
                                (B) From subsections (d) and (f) because providing access to
investigative records and the right to contest the contents of those records and force changes to
be made to the information contained therein would seriously interfere with and thwart the
orderly and unbiased conduct of the investigation and impede case preparation. Providing access
rights normally afforded under the Privacy Act would provide the subject with valuable
information that would allow interference with or compromise of witnesses or render witnesses
reluctant to cooperate; lead to suppression, alteration, or destruction of evidence; enable
individuals to conceal their wrongdoing or mislead the course of the investigation; and result in
the secreting of or other disposition of assets that would make them difficult or impossible to
reach in order to satisfy any Government claim growing out of the investigation or proceeding.
                               (C) From subsection (e)(1) because it is not always possible to
detect the relevance or necessity of each piece of information in the early stages of an
investigation. In some cases, it is only after the information is evaluated in light of other
evidence that its relevance and necessity will be clear.
                              (D) From subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H) because this system of
records is compiled for investigative purposes and is exempt from the access provisions of
subsections (d) and (f).
                               (E) From subsection (e)(4)(I) because to the extent that this
provision is construed to require more detailed disclosure than the broad, generic information
currently published in the system notice, an exemption from this provision is necessary to protect
the confidentiality of sources of information and to protect privacy and physical safety of
witnesses and informants.
   A3.6.19. System identifier and name: F031 DoD A, Joint Personnel Adjudication System.
                (i) Exemption: Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of
determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for federal civilian employment, military
service, federal contracts, or access to classified information may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
552a(k)(5), but only to the extent that such material would reveal the identity of a confidential
source. Therefore, portions of this system of records may be exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C.
552a(k)(5) from the following subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), and (e)(1).
               (ii) Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).
                 (iii) Reasons: (A) From subsection (c)(3) and (d) when access to accounting
disclosures and access to or amendment of records would cause the identity of a confidential
source to be revealed. Disclosure of the source‘s identity not only will result in the Department
breaching the promise of confidentiality made to the source but it will impair the Department‘s
future ability to compile investigatory material for the purpose of determining suitability,
eligibility, or qualifications for Federal civilian employment, Federal contracts, or access to
classified information. Unless sources can be assured that a promise of confidentiality will be
honored, they will be less likely to provide information considered essential to the Department in
making the required determinations.

                                (B) From subsection (e)(1) because in the collection of information
for investigatory purposes, it is not always possible to determine the relevance and necessity of
particular information in the early stages of the investigation. In some cases, it is only after the
information is evaluated in light of other information that its relevance and necessity becomes
clear. Such information permits more informed decision-making by the Department when
making required suitability, eligibility, and qualification determinations.

                (i) Exemption: During the processing of a Freedom of Information Act request,
exempt materials from `other" systems of records may in turn become part of the case record in
this system. To the extent that copies of exempt records from those other systems of records are
entered into this system, the Department of the Air Force hereby claims the same exemptions for
the records from those `other" systems that are entered into this system, as claimed for the
original primary system of which they are a part.

                (iii) Reasons: Records are only exempt from pertinent provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a
to the extent such provisions have been identified and an exemption claimed for the original
record, and the purposes underlying the exemption for the original record still pertain to the
record which is now contained in this system of records. In general, the exemptions were
claimed in order to protect properly classified information relating to national defense and
foreign policy, to avoid interference during the conduct of criminal, civil, or administrative
actions or investigations, to ensure protective services provided the President and others are not
compromised, to protect the identity of confidential sources incident to Federal employment,
military service, contract, and security clearance determinations, and to preserve the
confidentiality and integrity of Federal evaluation materials. The exemption rule for the original
records will identify the specific reasons why the records are exempt from specific provisions of
5 U.S.C. 552a.

                             PRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENT

Section A4A — Introduction and Overview

A4.1. The Privacy Act Assessment. The Air Force recognizes the importance of protecting the
privacy of individuals, to ensure sufficient protections for the privacy of personal information as
we implement citizen-centered e-Government. Privacy issues must be addressed when systems
are being developed, and privacy protections must be integrated into the development life cycle
of these automated systems. The vehicle for addressing privacy issues in a system under
development is the Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA). The PIA process also provides a means to
assure compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing individual privacy.
   A4.1.1. Purpose. The purpose of this document is to:
       A4.1.1.1. Establish the requirements for addressing privacy during the systems
       development process.
       A4.1.1.2. Describe the steps required to complete a PIA.
       A4.1.1.3. Define the privacy issues you will address in the PIA.
   A4.1.2. Background. The Air Force is responsible for ensuring the privacy, confidentiality,
   integrity, and availability of personal information. The Air Force recognizes that privacy
   protection is both a personal and fundamental right. Among the most basic of individuals‘
   rights is an expectation that the Air Force will protect the confidentiality of personal,
   financial, and employment information. Individuals also have the right to expect that the Air
   Force will collect, maintain, use, and disseminate identifiable personal information and data
   only as authorized by law and as necessary to carry out agency responsibilities. Personal
   information is protected by the following:

Section A4B — Privacy and Systems Development

A4.2. System Privacy. Rapid advancements in computer technology make it possible to store
and retrieve vast amounts of data of all kinds quickly and efficiently. These advancements have
raised concerns about the impact of large computerized information systems on the privacy of
data subjects. Public concerns about highly integrated information systems operated by the
government make it imperative to commit to a positive and aggressive approach to protecting
individual privacy. AF-CIO is requiring the use of this PIA in order to ensure that the systems
the Air Force develops protect individuals‘ privacy. The PIA incorporates privacy into the
development life cycle so that all system development initiatives can appropriately consider
privacy issues from the earliest stages of design.
   A4.2.1. What is a Privacy Impact Assessment? The PIA is a process used to evaluate privacy
   in information systems. The process is designed to guide system owners and developers in
   assessing privacy through the early stages of development. The process consists of privacy
   training, gathering data from a project on privacy issues, and identifying and resolving the
   privacy risks. The PIA process is described in detail in Section A4C, Completing a Privacy
   Impact Assessment.
   A4.2.2. When is a PIA Done? The PIA is initiated in the early stages of the development of a
   system and completed as part of the required system life cycle reviews. Privacy must be
   considered when requirements are being analyzed and decisions are being made about data
   usage and system design. This applies to all of the development methodologies and system
   life cycles used in the Air Force.
   A4.2.3. Who completes the PIA? Both the system owner and system developers must work
   together to complete the PIA. System owners must address what data is to be used, how the
   data is to be used, and who will use the data. The system developers must address whether
   the implementation of the owner‘s requirements presents any threats to privacy.
   A4.2.4. What systems have to complete a PIA? Accomplish PIAs when:
       A4.2.4.1. Developing or procuring information technology (IT) that collects, maintains,
       or disseminates information. in identifiable form from or about members of the public
       A4.2.4.2. Initiating a new collection of information, using IT, that collects, maintains, or
       disseminates information in identifiable form for 10 or more persons excluding agencies,
       instrumentalities, or employees of the Federal Government. .
       A4.2.4.3. Systems as described above that are undergoing major modifications.
   A4.2.5. The Air Force or MAJCOM Privacy Act Officer reserves the right to request that a
   PIA be completed on any system that may have privacy risks.

A4.3. The PIA. This section describes the steps required to complete a PIA. These steps are
summarized in Table A4.1, Outline of Steps for Completing a PIA.
A4.4. Training. Training on the PIA will be available, on request, from the MAJCOM Privacy
Act Officer. The training consists of describing the PIA process and provides detail about the
privacy issues and privacy questions to be answered to complete the PIA. MAJCOM Privacy Act
Officers may use Attachment 4, Section A4A, Section A4B, Section A4D, and Section A4E
for this purpose. The intended audience is the personnel responsible for writing the PIA
document.
A4.5. The PIA Document. Preparing the PIA document requires the system owner and
developer to answer the privacy questions in Section A4E. A brief explanation should be written
for each question. Issues that do not apply to a system should be noted as "Not Applicable."
During the development of the PIA document, the MAJCOM Privacy Act Officer will be
available to answer questions related to the PIA process and other concerns that may arise with
respect to privacy.
A4.6. Review of the PIA Document. Submit the completed PIA document to the MAJCOM
Privacy Act Office for review. The purpose of the review is to identify privacy risks in the
system.
A4.7. Approval of the PIA. The system life cycle review process (Command, Control,
Communications, Computers, and Intelligence Support Plan) will be used to validate the
incorporation of the design requirements to resolve the privacy risks. MAJCOM and HAF
Functional CIOs will issue final approval of the PIA.

Section A4D —Privacy Issues in Information Systems

A4.8. Privacy Issues in Information Systems.

Privacy Act of 1974 Title 5, U.S.C.,552a, The Privacy Act of 1974,as amended, requires
5 U.S.C. 552a As    Federal Agencies to protect personally identifiable information. It states
Amended             specifically:


                      Each agency that maintains a system of records shall:

                         maintain in its records only such information about an individual as is
                      relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required to
                      be accomplished by statute or by executive order of the President;

                        collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the
                      subject individual when the information may result in adverse
                      determinations about an individual‘s rights, benefits, and privileges under
                      Federal programs;

                        maintain all records used by the agency in making any determination
                      about any individual with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and
                      completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the
                      individual in the determination;

                         establish appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards
                      to ensure the security and confidentiality of records and to protect against
                      any anticipated threats or hazards to their security or integrity which
                      could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or
                      unfairness to any individual on whom information is maintained.
Definitions:          Accuracy -within sufficient tolerance for error to assure the quality of
                      the record in terms of its use in making a determination.
AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011                                                61


                Completeness -all elements necessary for making a determination are
                present before such determination is made.
                Determination- any decision affecting an individual which, in whole or
                in part, is based on information contained in the record and which is
                made by any person or agency.
                Necessary -a threshold of need for an element of information greater
                than mere relevance and utility.
                Record- any item, collection or grouping of information about an
                individual and identifiable to that individual that is maintained by an
                agency.
                Relevance -limitation to only those elements of information that clearly
                bear on the determination(s) for which the records are intended.
                Routine Use - with respect to the disclosure of a record, the use of such
                record outside DOD for a purpose that is compatible with the purpose for
                which it was collected.
                System of Records - a group of any records under the control of any
                agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual
                or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular
                assigned to the individual.
                Timeliness -sufficiently current to ensure that any determination based
                on the record will be accurate and fair.

Information and       To fulfill the commitment of the Air Force to protect personal
Privacy               information, several issues must be addressed with respect to privacy.

                      The use of information must be controlled.

                      Information may be used only for a necessary and lawful purpose.

                      Individuals must be informed in writing of the principal purpose and
                      routine uses of the information being collected from them.

                      Information collected for a particular purpose should not be used for
                      another purpose without the data subject‘s consent unless such other uses
                      are specifically authorized or mandated by law.

                      Any information used must be sufficiently accurate, relevant, timely and
                      complete to assure fair treatment of the individual.


                      Given the availability of vast amounts of stored information and the
                      expanded capabilities of information systems to process the information,
                      it is foreseeable that there will be increased requests to share that
                      information. With the potential expanded uses of data in automated
                      systems it is important to remember that information can only be used for
                      the purpose for which it was collected unless other uses are specifically
                      authorized or mandated by law. If the data is to be used for other
                      purposes, then the public must be provided notice of those other uses.


                      These procedures do not in themselves create any legal rights, but are
                      intended to express the full and sincere commitment of the Air Force to
                      protect individual privacy rights and which provide redress for violations
                      of those rights.
Data in the System The sources of the information in the system are an important privacy
                   consideration if the data is gathered from other than Air Force records.
                   Information collected from non-Air Force sources should be verified, to
                   the extent practicable, for accuracy, that the information is current, and
                   complete. This is especially important if the information will be used to
                   make determinations about individuals.
AFI33-332_TYNDALLAFBSUP_I 25 FEBRUARY 2011                                                       63


Access to the Data   Who has access to the data in a system must be defined and documented.
                     Users of the data can be individuals, other systems, and other agencies.
                     Individuals who have access to the data can be system users, system
                     administrators, system owners, managers, and developers. When
                     individuals are granted access to a system, their access should be limited,
                     where possible, to only that data needed to perform their assigned duties.
                     If individuals are granted access to all of the data in a system, procedures
                     need to be in place to deter and detect browsing and unauthorized access.
                     Other systems are any programs or projects that interface with the system
                     and have access to the data. Other agencies can be International, Federal,
                     state, or local entities that have access to Air Force data.
Attributes of the    When requirements for the data to be used in the system are being
Data                 determined, those requirements must include the privacy attributes of the
                     data. The privacy attributes are derived from the legal requirements
                     imposed by The Privacy Act of 1974. First, the data must be relevant and
                     necessary to accomplish the purpose of the system. Second, the data
                     must be complete, accurate, and timely. It is important to ensure the data
                     has these privacy attributes in order to assure fairness to the individual in
                     making decisions based on the data.
Maintenance of       Automation of systems can lead to the consolidation of processes, data,
Administrative       and the controls in place to protect the data. When administrative
Controls             controls are consolidated, they should be evaluated so that all necessary
                     controls remain in place to the degree necessary to continue to control
                     access to and use of the data.


                     Document record retention procedures and coordinate them with the
                     MAJCOM Command Records Manager.
