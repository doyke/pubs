and tear such as excessive scratches on the vehicle exterior paint or windows; damage resulting
from failure to accomplish operator care, e.g. failure to check engine oil etc.; intentional cutting
of upholstery or steering wheel; damage resulting from improper use of the vehicle, e.g. failure
to secure a load, overloading, improper towing; failure to report a malfunction that results in
extensive damage.

2.2. Vehicle incidents are classified as damage caused by acts of nature, natural disasters,
mechanical failures or other phenomenon that in no w ay could have been avoided by safe
operation or adequate vehicle care during non-use. NOTE: Wind damage to vehicle doors and
fenders is not an act of nature.

Vehicle Management with documentation, i.e. accident reports, release letters etc., as required.

the Transportation Manager for review and subsequent forwarding to the vehicle-owning unit
VCO.

copy of the damage repair estimate; copy of the accident notification sent to the unit VCO; unit
VCO vehicle release; copy of AF Form 20 (if applicable); other pertinent information.

5.3.4. The Transportation Manager will notify 71 FTW/SE of all government vehicle accidents,
and will forward that office a copy of the SF 91 Vehicle Accident Report after it is received from
the vehicle operator.

VCO, the Transportation Manager will direct that repair action be initiated. Standard vehicle
maintenance procedures for repairs will be followed. Repairs which exceed local capability,
such as frame straightening, will be accomplished via contract maintenance with local vendors.
