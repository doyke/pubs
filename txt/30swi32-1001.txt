                                              Chapter 1

                      30TH CIVIL ENGINEER SQUADRON OVERVIEW

1.1. Operations Flight (CEO). The bulk of day-to-day work is accomplished by an in-house
work force known as the Operations Flight. It is comprised of four elements and roughly 12 shops
of carpenters, electricians, plumbers, heating and air-conditioning technicians, heavy equipment
operators and generator technicians.
     1.1.1. Operations Engineering Element (CEOE). Requirements & Optimization (CEOER),
     Material Acquisitions (CEOEM), Service Contracts (CEOES), and the Material Diversion
     Center (MDC) fall under this element. The Requirements & Optimization Section is the
     clearinghouse for all work requests. The Customer Service/Production Management Unit
     division in this section receives and processes work requests and controls responses to
     emergency and urgent work. The Material Acquisitions Section is responsible for maintaining
     material stock levels to support CE’s in-house work plan, schedules, and material budget. This
     section also establishes the long-range material acquisition plan for the support of contracted
     and planned CE work. The Service Contracts Section is responsible for managing all service
     contracts that help keep base facilities clean and professional looking. Some of the services
     offered by the Service Contracts Section include: grounds maintenance, custodial services,
     solid waste collection and disposal, chemical toilets and entomology services. An Entomology
     shop is not maintained, however, the Service Contracts Section can assist facility managers
     with recommendations and advice concerning entomology issues. The MDC provides free
     issue of used government furniture to those on base and also manages the base’s Qualified
     Recycling Program (QRP) where all recycled scrap metal, wood pallets, etc., can be dropped
     off for proper disposal.
     1.1.2. Facility Systems Element (CEOF). Oversees the Electric (CEOFE), Power Production
     (CEOFP), and Alarm (CEOFA) Shops. This element maintains and repairs all electrical
     systems, generators and power producing equipment, smoke detectors, and fire alarms.
     1.1.3. Heavy Repair Element (CEOH). Oversees the Structures (CEOHS) and Horizontal
     Construction (CEOHP) Shops. The Structures Shop includes carpenters, locksmiths, welders
     and graphic illustrators in the Sign Shop. Their responsibility is to perform structural
     maintenance and repair work, as well as, renovations in order to maintain the quality of life for
     facility occupants and life expectancy of facilities. The Horizontal Construction Shop is
     responsible for heavy construction work to include paving, concrete work including storm
     drainage systems, and earth work.
     1.1.4. Infrastructure Systems Element (CEOI). Oversees the Heating, Ventilation, and Air
     Conditioning (CEOIH) Shop, Water & Fuels System Maintenance (CEOIU) Shop, and Water
     Plant Operations. This element maintains all of Vandenberg’s utility systems including water,
     sewer and gas lines, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning infrastructure, and the liquid
     fuels infrastructure. This element also operates two base water plants.
1.2. Engineering Flight (CEN). This flight consists of engineers, architects, project managers,
and asset managers who manage the construction, renovation, maintenance, repair, energy, and
portfolio optimization contracts designed to upgrade, build, and optimize new facilities while
minimizing energy consumption. This flight manages work being performed via an outside
30SWI32-1001 9 OCTOBER 2013                                                                      5


contract. Facility managers interface with this flight if the work request is designated for contract
accomplishment and becomes a "project". Facility managers should be aware of any projects that
are programmed against their facility and the year in which they are scheduled for
funding/design/construction. Facility managers can contact CENPD, Program Development, if
more information is needed (606-3235).
   1.2.1. Portfolio Optimization Element (CENP). This element provides site planning, initiates
   project planning, oversees energy program development, and tracks a host of activity
   management plans and the overall base comprehensive activity management plan to support
   the installation master plan. The Program Development Section (CENPD) coordinates work
   requests that are being done as contract projects through required programming processes to
   obtain approvals and funding. Conducts the base’s Facility Board process in which base
   organizations prioritize projects according to projected fiscal year funding targets. This
   element prepares cost estimates and approval documents for projects requiring Wing or higher
   approval levels and relies on the user to define their requirements so the proper approval levels
   can be sought. The Energy Manager Section (CENPE) develops and maintains the installation
   energy management plan by performing energy and water conservation audits to identify
   inefficient uses of energy. This section also initiates energy savings performance contracts to
   execute energy savings projects. The Planning Section (CENPL) tracks land use and site
   planning, conducts air installation compatible use zone studies, builds area development plans,
   manages the airfield obstruction program, plans new mission beddowns, and manages off-base
   planning compatible land use activities to monitor base encroachments.
   1.2.2. Project Management Element (CENM). This element provides project management of
   large contract, SABER, and Roofing and Paving Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity
   (ID/IQ) projects. The Project Execution Section (CENMP) typically handles architect-
   engineer designs and other military construction projects being executed for base customers by
   the Corps of Engineers. This section also includes the SABER office, which provides project
   management of contract projects being executed through Simplified Acquisition of Base
   Engineering Requirements (SABER) and ID/IQ contract avenues. These projects are typically
   those which require little or no design and therefore bypass the architect-engineer design
   process. SABER and ID/IQ projects can range in scope (i.e. single discipline roofing or paving
   projects to multi-discipline electrical, mechanical, and/or structural projects) and dollar
   amounts. The Execution Support Section (CENME) provides in-house design and project
   management of “special interest” projects. These projects may involve design of memorials
   and marquees, interior design, or have elements that require closer coordination with respect to
   Vandenberg’s Facilities Excellence Standard publication, anti-terrorism standards, Americans
   with Disability Act (ADA), or “green” sustainability design. This element also includes the
   Geospatial Integration Office, the base’s focal point for GIS mapping data and resources.
1.3. Installation Management Flight (CEI). This flight is responsible for environmental
conservation, quality, pollution prevention and restoration, real estate accountability and
optimization, capital asset management, privatized housing support, resources, force management,
and information technology (IT) administration.
   1.3.1. Environmental Element (CEIE). This section is responsible for ensuring that all
   Vandenberg AFB mission requirements are supported through compliance with numerous
   federal, state, county, Air Force and DoD environmental laws, regulations and permits. They
   oversee the abatement of lead-based paint and asbestos-containing materials and track the
 6                                                          30SWI32-1001 9 OCTOBER 2013


     procurement, usage, re-issue, and/or disposal of hazardous materials. These tasks are
     accomplished by Facility Managers who should be aware of all asbestos-containing materials
     or lead-based paint in the facilities under their responsibility and be prepared to inform
     building occupants and affix warning signage as appropriate. Facility Managers must also be
     aware of the types of hazardous materials (HAZMAT) that are stored in their facilities and the
     legal requirements for storage. Disposal of hazardous waste and solid waste must be
     coordinated through CEIE. Facility Managers must also remain diligent to avoid Vandenberg's
     facilities becoming unintended bird nesting areas.
     1.3.2. Asset Accountability Element (CEIA). This section manages and updates all base real
     property records, organizes space utilization review boards, tracks all 30 CES funding
     resources and provides financial planning, budgeting and cost accounting, monitors force
     management to track CE manpower and develop efficient manpower strategies, and hosts the
     IT administration that is the focal point for CE information management tools.
     1.3.3. Housing Management Element (CEIH). This section is responsible for assigning all
     unaccompanied base housing, co-monitoring accompanied base housing, maintaining the
     dormitories and associated furnishings, as well as, maintaining the Dormitory Manager
     program and providing privatized housing support to the Balfour Beatty Community (BBC)
     Manager.
1.4. Fire Protection Flight (CEF). One of the many jobs of 30 CES is to provide fire protection
services to Vandenberg AFB. The base fire department operates five fire stations on base.

                                              Chapter 2

                       FACILITY MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Designating the Commander Responsible for the Facility. If facilities are occupied with
multiple organizations, the organization which occupies the most square footage will have primary
facility manager responsibility. Commanders, through their Facility Manager, will typically:
     2.1.1. Officially request work by submitting an AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work
     Request.
     2.1.2. Notify the Production Management Unit (PMU) in CEOER when relieving or
     appointing a facility manager at least 10 days in advance. The commander must submit a
     Facility Manager Appointment Letter to the PMU (see Attachment 2 for letter format).
2.2. PMU. Will schedule and provide a mandatory briefing on duties and responsibilities to all
newly appointed facility managers. Thereafter, an annual refresher class will be scheduled to
provide information on any changes in CE operations which may affect the Facility Manager. If
new guidance comes out prior to the annual refresher training, PMU will forward the information
out to all facility managers via the facility manager e-mail distribution listing.
2.3. Facility Manager.
     2.3.1. Identify and control occupant requests for all work requirements needed to maintain
     and/or upgrade the facility to ensure mission readiness and a quality work environment.
     Except for emergencies, 30 CES will ONLY coordinate with the commander or facility
     manager when creating or reviewing a work order submitted for approval and will provide all
     feedback to those individuals.
        2.3.1.1. If a work order is designated for contract accomplishment there will be occasions
        when other unit representatives may be asked to participate in design reviews to lend their
        expertise to design details that the commander or facility manager are not required (but
        highly encouraged) to be involved in.
     2.3.2. Serves as the commander and facility occupants' representative to the Base Civil
     Engineer (BCE) for any work needed on real property or Real Property Installed Equipment
     (RPIE), regardless of their status as a military member, federal employee, or a contractor
     supporting the Air Force.
     2.3.3. Notify CE Customer Service (CEOER) regarding a deployment or TDY. Submit a
     memorandum naming a temporary Alternate or Primary FM for your facilities prior to

                                             Chapter 3

                                   FACILITY MANAGEMENT

3.1. Safety. Facility managers are responsible for periodically inspecting their facilities for
potential safety hazards and reporting them to the proper agencies. Utilize AFI 91-203, Air Force
Consolidated Occupational Safety Instruction, to ensure that all safety requirements are being met.
For critical facilities such as spacecraft or launch vehicle processing and launch facilities, Facility
Managers shall, at a minimum, also comply with AFSPCMAN 91-710, Range Safety User
Requirements Manual. If an AF Form 332 is needed to correct a safety violation, attach the write-
up to the form.
   3.1.1. Inspection of Ladders. Inspection of all real property fixed ladders inside and outside of
   a facility is required to be performed by CE and documented by the facility manager every
   three (3) years in accordance with AFI 91-203, Para. 7.4.3.1. A ladder inventory and
   inspection log will be maintained in the facility manager binder. Facility manager shall notify
   CEOER of any discrepancies noted by CE during fixed ladder inspections. With regard to
   ladder access requirements, AFI 91-203, Para. 7.4.2.6. states that where unauthorized use of a
   fixed ladder is a problem, the facility manager or security department shall ensure the ladders
   are secured from unauthorized access. Ladders available to public access require guarding to
   prevent unauthorized access. Typically, the bottom seven (7) feet shall be guarded. Examples
   of guarding include the use of a fence with locked gates and making the bottom portion
   portable or spring loaded and available only as needed. Additionally, there must be a warning
   sign prohibiting access by unauthorized persons.
   3.1.2. Facility managers whose facilities contain significant Asbestos Containing Material
   (ACM) - as determined by the Asbestos Program Manager in 30 CES/CEIE - are required to
   receive initial and recurring asbestos awareness training. Squadron/Unit Commanders are
   responsible for ensuring that affected facility managers receive this training and that it is
   documented in their personnel records. Contact the Installation Management Flight to
   schedule asbestos awareness training at 606-1921.
   3.1.3. Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC). AFI 91-203, Para. 10.10. states
   that Facility managers shall ensure that IAW ANSI/ASHRAE 62.1-2010, Ventilation for
   Acceptable Indoor Air Quality, office HVAC systems shall be inspected as needed. A
   recommended interval is distinct to individual models (at least semiannually or annually is
   suggested), to prevent the buildup of dust, mold and/or parasites. Filters shall be changed as
   needed. Do not cover air vents or obstruct air flow from registers. Do not place furniture,
   equipment or materials where they interfere with air movement or thermostats. Facility
   Managers shall ensure that rooms meet temperatures of 68 to 78 degrees F for a comfortable
   office environment. Whenever possible, workers shall be located away from vents to avoid
   direct contact with hot or cold air.
3.2. Security. Facility managers establish standard procedures for ensuring all facilities are
secure from illegal entry. Any mechanical or structural deficiency that results in an unsecured
facility constitutes an emergency and should be called into CEOER immediately at 606-0010
during duty hours or the DCC at 606-1856 during after duty hours (see Paragraph 4.1.2.1).
30SWI32-1001 9 OCTOBER 2013                                                                    11


   3.2.1. Security Forces patrols conduct regular security checks of base facilities. If Security
   Forces finds an unsecured building (door unlocked, window open, etc.) during non-duty hours,
   the facility manager will be called to secure the facility. A follow-up DD Form 1569,
   Incident/Complaint Report, will be sent to the commander for action. For questions
   concerning building security, contact the Security Forces Crime Prevention Section, 606-2655;
   the Resources Protection Section, 605-0759; or the Law Enforcement Desk, 606-3911.
3.3. Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection. During times of heightened FPCON levels, the facility
manager is responsible for ensuring the facility meets all requirements outlined in the appropriate
FPCON checklist. Once an FPCON change occurs, it should be reported to the applicable Unit
Control Center (UCC). Facility managers should be conducting facility walkthroughs periodically
to assess security and AT/FP concerns. Any suspicious packages or other potential AT/FP issues
should be reported to the Law Enforcement Desk immediately at 606-3911.
3.4. Key Control. Keys will only be issued to facility managers from the Civil Engineer
Structures Lock Shop (30 CES/CEOHS). All keys will be signed over to the facility manager on
AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, and this form will be stored in the facility folder in the
Lock Shop. Key control starts when the keys are issued. Facility managers should issue all keys
on an AF Form 2432, Key Issue Log (or locally generated equivalent). Master keys should be
strictly controlled by the unit commander and facility manager. Additional master keys will only
be issued to facility managers with a signed MFR from the Unit Commander. A copy of the MFR
will be stored in Lock Shop facility folders.
   3.4.1. Key Duplication. Facility managers and commanders responsible for facilities are the
   only personnel authorized to request key duplication or replacement. This is accomplished by
   submitting an AF Form 332 to CEOER. Upon satisfactory review of the request, a Direct
   Schedule Work (DSW) number will be assigned. Requests for these keys will be accepted as
   long as they are not for personal convenience or to take the place of those lost through
   negligence.
   3.4.2. U.S. Government Property. Keys issued are the property of the U.S. Government. If a
   key is tampered with or duplicated, disciplinary action will be taken; only the 30 CES Lock
   Shop has the authority to cut/issue new keys. Lost keys will be replaced at the individual’s
   expense.
   3.4.3. Lost/Stolen Keys. Any person losing keys must notify their immediate supervisor and
   facility manager immediately to ensure against compromising the facility’s security. The
   facility manager will notify the Real Property office by telephone or in person and follow-up
   by submitting a lost key report.
       3.4.3.1. If a key is lost or stolen, the facility manager will determine impact and notify 30
       SFS, if applicable, due to security reasons. The facility manager will notify the 30 CES
       Lock Shop with a written lost key report for filing in the appropriate facility folder for
       historic purposes. This form will be used to inform 30 SFS that a facility has lost the
       ability to secure government property effectively.
       3.4.3.2. Upon receiving notice of a compromised area due to lost or stolen keys, the Real
       Property office may:
           3.4.3.2.1. Have all affected cores replaced, if deemed necessary.
 12                                                           30SWI32-1001 9 OCTOBER 2013


           3.4.3.2.2. Re-issue keys to affected area, if applicable.
           3.4.3.2.3. Notify section/unit involved that the cost for re-keying an area due to
           lost/stolen keys or duplicated keys is their responsibility. The unit’s Resource Manager
           will provide a JON # which will be written on the BCE Work Request 332.
   3.4.4. GSA Containers and Equipment Items. Safes are not real property and are the
   responsibility of the user. All parts/labor provided by CE will be reimbursed by the owner of
   the equipment. Any work provided by CE will be on a case by case basis.
       3.4.4.1. Security Managers are responsible for the numbering and management of their
       unit’s security containers. AFTO Form 36, Maintenance Record for Security Type
       Equipment, should be maintained and kept with each container for duration of its use.
       These forms will be utilized by Lock Shop personnel to troubleshoot any problems with the
       container. Combination changes should be performed by the user, and Standard Form 700,
       Security Container Information, utilized. If a user is new to the process of changing a
       combination, they should contact their unit Security manager to inquire about how to
       change the combination. Security Managers should maintain a listing of all combination
       locks in their unit, and maintain directions for the proper use of each type. If information is
       required, they should contact the DoD Lock Program. The 30 CES Lock shop will provide
       training on combination locks on a case by case basis.
       3.4.4.2. Information for security containers and responsibilities of users can be found on
       the DoD Lock Program website. Federal/DoD specifications and troubleshooting guides
       can also be downloaded. Contact the Technical Support Hotline to obtain information
       about security requirements. Call the DoD Lock Program Technical Support Hotline

3.5. Energy Management. The facility manager has the most direct influence in helping meet
base energy reduction goals. Facility managers should periodically evaluate facility use to ensure
responsible energy practices are being applied. Detailed energy conservation tips are available in
the 30 SW Facility Manager Energy Conservation Handbook. Facility managers can obtain a copy
from the Base Energy Manager who can be contacted at 606-0772. Energy conservation tips
facility managers should monitor:
   3.5.1. Thermostats are set at correct temperatures (78 degrees in summer, 68 degrees in
   winter).
   3.5.2. Windows and doors are closed during heating and cooling.
   3.5.3. Lights are turned off after hours or when not in use.
   3.5.4. Unused equipment is turned off.
   3.5.5. Plumbing fixtures (sinks, commodes, urinals, showers, etc.) not wasting water due to
   leaks.
3.6. Water Quality. Vandenberg AFB is required by permits and regulations to prevent and
reduce pollutants in wastewater, storm water and drinking water. For additional guidance, contact
30 CES/CEIE, Water Resources Program Manager, at 606-7541.
   3.6.1. Discharge to Grade (DTG): Accumulated and high pressure wash water may contain
   contaminants. Prior to release of water to grade, obtain an approved DTG Form from 30

       chemicals to the sanitary sewer system.
   3.6.2. Release of anything other than storm water into storm drains or ditches is prohibited by
   federal regulations and state permit. Use Best Management Practices (BMPs) to prevent
   chemicals, materials or sediment from entering into storm drains. BMPs include good
   housekeeping, spill prevention, waste disposal, erosion and sediment control.
   3.6.3. Connecting to VAFB Water Supply: There are only two approved connection points to
   the VAFB water supply. Contact the 30 CES Horizontal Shop at 606-6165 for more
   information regarding access to these points. All other connections to VAFB water supply
   sources not fitted with an approved backflow prevention assembly (BPA) are prohibited. This
   measure has been implemented for force protection measures per AFI 32-1066, Backflow
   Prevention Program.
3.7. Evacuation Procedures. The facility manager is responsible for ensuring building
evacuation procedures are followed and building occupants are aware of proper evacuation
procedures.
   3.7.1. Buildings with an occupancy of 10 or more will establish an emergency action plan
   (EAP) in accordance with AFI 91-203, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety
   Instruction.
   3.7.2. Evacuation routes and rally points should be determined and posted around the facility
   and at each exit.
3.8. Shelter-in-Place (SIP) Procedures. The facility manager will assist in SIP standup and
execution regarding buildings and occupants in accordance with the direction of the Shelter
Commander and/or the Shelter Supervisor. In these situations, facility managers will normally be
instructed to use SIP through email alert or a phone call from the UCC. Certain FPCON changes
may require shelter-in-place actions as well.
   3.8.1. The facility manager should conduct an initial building assessment to determine what
   protective actions are practical for the building and what hazardous materials are stored or used
   in or near the building.
       3.8.1.1. Once the initial assessment is complete, contact the Civil Engineer Readiness
       Flight (30 CES/CEX) to schedule an assessment and develop the shelter plan. Attachment
       5 includes some tips for sheltering in place, evacuating the building, and suggested items
       for a shelter-in-place kit.
3.9. Service Contracts. Facility managers should be knowledgeable of the services the facility
receives through service contracts (grounds maintenance, refuse collection, custodial services, etc.)
and what these services include. The CE Service Contracts section (see Paragraph 1.1.1) can
provide specific information on facility’s service contracts.
   3.9.1. If a problem arises, the facility manager should contact the CE Service Contracts
   section. They are the only office authorized to communicate with the contractor. Neither the

   facility manager nor the building occupants should approach the contractor or the contractor’s
   employees.
3.10. Fire Prevention. Fire Prevention is everyone’s responsibility, but it is the facility
manager’s responsibility to ensure building occupants maintain good housekeeping practices and
are aware of fire reporting procedures, location and use of fire extinguishers, and evacuation routes
and procedures.3.10.1. Fire Inspections. Fire Inspectors will coordinate regular fire prevention
visits to each facility. Facility managers will accompany fire inspectors on these visits. The
facility manager will take action to correct fire safety concerns addressed by the fire inspector. If
concerns cannot be corrected on the spot, an AF Form 1487, Fire Prevention Visit Report, will be
established documenting violations. Facility managers are required to submit an AF Form 332 to
30 CES to correct these deficiencies. Attach a copy of the AF Form 1487 to the AF Form 332.
   3.10.1. Fire Evacuation Drills. 30 SWI 32-102, Fire Prevention, requires at least one fire
   evacuation drill per year. If fire alarms are to be used, arrange for their use at least one day
   prior. Conduct fire evacuation drills more often than annually in accordance with Table 3.9.2
   in the Space Wing instruction.

CEOER for assistance. Light bulbs can be purchased at building 5500, Base Service Store, by
organizations using a Government Purchase Card (GPC).
3.17. Electrical Circuit Panels. Ensuring circuit panels are properly labeled is the responsibility
of facility managers. This may take some coordination with other building occupants.
3.18. Customer Service Tracking. In an effort to ensure customers are provided with the best
service possible, CEOER has created a Customer Service Survey (see Attachment 7). Upon
completion of a work order or DSW, facility managers complete the survey and return it to
Customer Service or send it through the base distribution system, addressed to 30 CES/CEOE.
These surveys will be included in the work order folder that is returned to facility managers when
the work order is closed out. They may also be obtained by the technicians performing the work.
3.19. Facility Closeout Procedures. When an organization is vacating a facility and turning it
over to another organization for use, the Real Property Management office (30 CES/CEIAP) has
procedures that must be followed. Please contact 30 CES/CEIAP for more information.
3.20. Hazardous Waste. Regulations to protect public health and the environment identify which
items constitute hazardous waste or "universal waste" (u-waste). As of February 9, 2006, all "u-
waste" items were banned from regular trash disposal. It is illegal to dispose of hazardous waste in
garbage, storm drains, or on the ground. Chemicals illegally disposed of can be released into the
environment and contaminate the air, water and food.
   3.20.1. Disposal. Some hazardous waste materials can be recycled or safely disposed of at
   VAFB’s Centralized Accumulation Point (CAP).
   3.20.2. Each unit’s Hazardous Waste Management POC or 30 CES/CEIE can answer any

        sump pumps, electric space heaters, clothes irons, silent light switches, automobile
        hood and trunk lights, and ABS brakes.
        3.20.3.5.2. Thermostats that contain mercury. There is mercury inside the sealed glass
        "tilt switch" of the old style thermostats (not the newer electronic kind).
        3.20.3.5.3. Pilot light sensors. Mercury-containing switches are found in gas
        appliances such as stoves, ovens, clothes dryers, water heaters, furnaces, and space
        heaters.
        3.20.3.5.4. Mercury gauges. Gauges, such as barometers, manometers, blood pressure,
        and vacuum gauges contain mercury.
        3.20.3.5.5. Mercury thermometers. Mercury thermometers contain about a half gram
        of mercury. Many health clinics, pharmacies and doctor offices will exchange new
        mercury-free fever thermometers in place of old ones.
        3.20.3.5.6. Mercury-added novelties. Examples include greeting cards that play music

                                           Chapter 4

                               THE WORK FLOW PROCESS

4.1. Work Categories.
   4.1.1. Self-Help Work. There are many instances where an individual or organization may
   have the ability and desire to accomplish minor work themselves. This work can be
   accomplished through the CE Self-Help program. Self-help should be the first option for
   completing work. Facility Managers must indicate they desire self-help on the AF Form 332
   prior to submitting.
      4.1.1.1. Submit an AF Form 332 to Customer Service for approval prior to initiating work.
      Upon receipt of a 332, CEOER will determine whether this work is beyond the scope of a
      DSW, defined in Paragraph 4.1.2. If the work is beyond that scope it will be forwarded to
      multiple base agencies for coordination. Once this has been completed, an estimate will be
      developed and the Work Request will be forwarded to the Work Request Review Board for
      final approval/disapproval and routed for completion. The 30 CES process for approval of
      AF Form 332 is detailed in Paragraph 4.3 and Attachment 3. The requester must furnish
      labor and may also supply materials/funds from unit resources. After the request is
      approved by 30 CES to commence with self-help work, the CE Planning Section will plan
      the work, order materials, and call the requestor to pick up materials upon arrival. Once the
      project begins, 30 CES will inspect as necessary to ensure quality craftsmanship,
      coordinate support, and ensure timely completion. Customer Service can provide specific
      details for self help work procedures.
   4.1.2. Direct Scheduled Work (DSW). DSW is work that does not require detailed planning.
   These are jobs that require less than 50 hours to complete. They will be completed by 30 CES.
   DSW is classified as emergency, urgent, or routine as defined below. Emergency/Urgent
   DSWs are the only type of work request that can be called into Customer Service rather than
   submitted through the CE Tools Portal. Facility managers must provide details about the
   request to Customer Service Controllers to ensure proper job classification.
      4.1.2.1. Emergency. Work is required to eliminate conditions that are detrimental to
      overall mission, life threatening, or if not corrected, may cause substantial property
      damage. Emergency work is needed to provide adequate security to areas subject to
      compromise, eliminate serious health hazards, prevent serious fire or safety hazards, or
      protect valuable equipment and property. An emergency will always include, but is not
      limited to, failure of major utility, fire protection, or security alarm systems. Failure of
      critical air conditioning system, loss of heat, water, and gas or sewers backing up when the
      entire system is affected, may be designated an emergency. Emergency work must be
      called in to Customer Service and they will make the final determination of work
      classification based on information provided. Emergency work requests will be completed
      or secured within 24 hours. Some examples of emergency work requests are below:
          4.1.2.1.1. Overflowing commodes or clogged sewer lines. NOTE: A single clogged
          commode in a facility with other functioning commodes is an example of what is not
          considered an emergency.
          4.1.2.1.2. Smell of smoke or natural gas.
30SWI32-1001 9 OCTOBER 2013                                                                    21


         4.1.2.1.3. Arcing electrical wires.
         4.1.2.1.4. Broken water mains.
         4.1.2.1.5. Inoperative fire alarm or suppression system.
         4.1.2.1.6. Broken windows or doors which must be secured after normal duty hours. A
         cracked window is not generally considered an emergency.
         4.1.2.1.7. Roof leaks jeopardizing operations or substantial loss of government
         property. If the government property can be moved to prevent water damage, the leak
         will not be coded an emergency. If possible, move all equipment/furniture and cover
         with plastic. For safety reasons, CE personnel will not fix or inspect roof leaks during
         rain storms.
         4.1.2.1.8. Loss of utilities/power to a facility.
         4.1.2.1.9. Loss of air conditioning for mission-essential equipment. NOTE: Loss of
         comfort air conditioning will not be termed an emergency.
         4.1.2.1.10. Loss of refrigeration for perishable materials.
     4.1.2.2. Urgent. Work does not have an immediate impact on mission effectiveness,
     safety, security, or equipment. If not fixed in a timely manner, the condition could escalate
     into an emergency. Urgent work will be completed or secured within 7 duty days of the
     request being submitted to 30 CES. Urgent requests must be called in by the facility
     manager. Examples of urgent work are below:
         4.1.2.2.1. Loss of isolated utility in facility (No power in one or two outlets in a
         facility, one commode clogged-up with one or more commodes functioning, etc).
         4.1.2.2.2. Isolated roof leaks not threatening damage to high value property or causing
         safety concerns.
         4.1.2.2.3. Cracked windows with potential to break and cause a security problem.
     4.1.2.3. Routine. Routine work requests are defined as all maintenance other than
     emergency or urgent which is necessary to maintain and operate facilities and protect them
     from further deterioration/damage. Routine requests must be submitted on an AF Form
     332. Approved routine work will be completed within 30 duty days of request or receipt of
     material.
  4.1.3. Work Order (AF Form 332). Work Order requests are for projects that require detailed
  planning. A planned work order requires the completion of an AF Form 332 and may require
  the AF Form 103, Base Civil Engineer Work Clearance Request, and/or an AF Form 813,
  Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, if applicable. Only facility managers and
  organization commanders are the authorized to submit an AF Form 332.
     4.1.3.1. Requests for work on base infrastructure (electrical systems, heating, ventilation,
     air conditioning systems, water and sewer systems, etc.) must be submitted by the facility
     manager, but will normally be at the direction of a 30 CES technician or engineer.
     4.1.3.2. Requests for facility projects (renovations, relocation of internal utility/electrical
     systems, improvements requests, demolition, etc.) must be requested by the organization
     commander.
22                                                        30SWI32-1001 9 OCTOBER 2013


     4.1.3.3. All requests for exterior work must be submitted with a map showing the exact
     location of the requested work. A request will not be processed without this map.
     4.1.3.4. All work orders that require a completed Form 103, Base Civil Engineer Work
     Clearance Request, must have this coordinated and approved before work can begin. This
     process is explained in Paragraph 4.2.1
     4.1.3.5. An AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, may be required
     prior to work. The Environmental Element (CEIE) will note whether an AF Form 813 is
     required during initial coordination. These forms are completed by the organization doing
     the work (SABER, CEO, CEN, etc.). In some cases, the requester may be required to
     complete this form.
  4.1.4. 30 CES Work Flow Process.
     4.1.4.1. Attachment 3 shows a flow chart of the basic CE work flow process.
     4.1.4.2. The first input occurs with Customer Service, regardless if request is made via
     phone or an AF Form 332. The Customer Service Controller will determine how the work
     request will be handled and the required documentation. If Customer Service determines
     that the work can be done via DSW, a DSW number will be created and forwarded to the
     appropriate shop for scheduling.
     4.1.4.3. If the requested work requires detailed planning or requires over 50 man-hours to
     complete, the requestor will need to fill out the AF Form 332 and return it to CEOER via
     the CE Tools Portal website. Attachment 4 provides step-by-step instructions for filling
     out this form. CEOER will forward this request out to selected base agencies for
     coordination and planning. They will assign a work order number and process the request
     upon approval at the Work Request Review Board.
     4.1.4.4. During the coordination phase, the work request will be sent to Comprehensive
     Plans, Installation Management, Fire Department, Ground Safety, Bio-Environmental, Real
     Property, Communications, Customer Service, Facilities Excellence, and any applicable CE
     Shop.
     4.1.4.5. After the work request has been fully coordinated and a cost estimate is
     completed, it will proceed to the Work Request Review Board (WRRB), which is chaired
     by the Operations Flight Commander or Deputy. The WRRB is comprised of Operations
     Flight element chiefs, as well as, Programs Development and Environmental Element
     representatives as required. The function of the board is to evaluate all information
     provided on the original work request and determine the method of accomplishment. Not
     all work requests will be seen at this board; most work requests can actually be approved
     off-line if there are no questions or additional coordination on them required.
     4.1.4.6. The Facility Manager or representative will be invited to attend to answer
     questions or provide a justification to the WRRB chair. The board determines how best to
     meet customer needs and approves, disapproves, or tables requests for a follow-on review.
     If a Facility Manager fails to attend a WRRB where their request is on the agenda, they risk
     this request being tabled for consideration until they attend a WRRB.
  4.1.5. Contract Project. If the WRRB determines that a work request is outside the scope of
  CE in-house capabilities, they will be forwarded to the Engineering Flight Program
30SWI32-1001 9 OCTOBER 2013                                                                   23


   Development Element. A project number will be assigned, along with the method of contract,
   and the type of work identified will be used to acquire funding. There are several methods of
   contract that the Engineering Flight uses to accomplish work. They include working with other
   construction contracting agencies (e.g. the Corps of Engineers and the Air Force Civil Engineer
   Center), Simplified Acquisition of Base Engineer Requirements (SABER), Indefinite
   Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ), Launch Operations and Support Center (LO&SC), and
   Contract by Requester. The funding time frame will depend on many factors including size of
   the project, impact on the mission, and whether the requester will provide funds. Most projects
   must be presented at the semi-annual Facility Board chaired by the Wing Commander. The
   Wing Commander will approve a prioritized list of projects that CE will fund from AFSPC’s
   budget. Customers will need to lobby the Facilities Board for funds for their work requests.
   The Engineering Flight Program Development Element (CENPD) conducts the Facilities
   Board semi-annual cycle which has its meetings in the March/April and October/November
   timeframes. Typically, the meetings have two/three preparatory meetings before the Wing
   Commander-chaired Facilities Board. The preparatory meetings review the various funding
   programs, including Sustainment, Restoration & Modernization (SRM) and Military
   Construction (MILCON), and provide base customers the opportunity for them to advocate
   their facility needs before deputy group commander representatives for prioritization within the
   AFSPC funding targets. Facility Managers who need to learn more about the Facilities Board
   process and schedule can contact the CENPD Element Chief at 606-3235.
   4.1.6. Contract by Requester. Contract by requester is used when an organization procures its
   own contractor to accomplish work. CE must review and approve the work before it can begin
   using the AF Form 332 process. The project will also be closed out with CE using the IWIMS
   Form 327 that is provided to the requester upon completion of the work. The Form 327 is used
   to track work order status. Required signatures for closeout include the planner, shop chief,
   authorizing official, material acquisition, on-site job coordinator, and the Operations Flight
   Chief or Deputy.
   4.1.7. In-House Project. Multiple CE shops may need to provide support for in-house work
   orders. The shop who will accomplish the majority of the work will be assigned as the lead.
4.2. Work Clearance.
   4.2.1. When work will or has the potential to interrupt base utilities, traffic flow, airfield
   operations, disturb asbestos, or presents other hazards, an AF Form 103 is required prior to
   work being started. Examples are excavations, demolition, work on or near roads or airfield,
   large projects, and new construction. Also, coordinating agencies can request a 103 be
   completed as notification for when work is about to begin.
      4.2.1.1. The individual, organization, or contractor accomplishing the work is responsible
      for completing the AF Form 103. If this requirement is ignored and damages are incurred,
      all costs for repairs will be charged to the responsible party.
      4.2.1.2. A work request should be completed within 30 days prior to the start of
      construction.
      4.2.1.3. Work Clearance Requests must be signed and approved by the Operations Flight
      Commander or Deputy (CEO or CEO-1), Chief/Deputy of Engineering (CEN), or their
      representative. Before starting work, the person carrying out the excavation must
24                                                         30SWI32-1001 9 OCTOBER 2013


     physically be in possession of a valid AF Form 332, AF Form 103, and AF Form 813 (if
     required). An exception to this rule is that for DSW work; an AF Form 332 is not required
     to process an AF Form 103. Plans must identify underground services, utilities, and
     environmental concerns in the area. The clearance will remain valid for up to one year
     from the date of final approval. The approving official may reduce this time period on a
     case-by-case basis. For work around base-owned utilities, a clearance is only valid for six
     months. If a non-base-owned utility is affected, the requester must update the USA number
     every 14 calendar days if excavation continues beyond 14 days.
     4.2.1.4. Excavations. An approved Work Clearance Request is required for any interior or
     exterior excavation regardless of depth. This type of clearance requires marking
     underground utilities in the area of excavation. Organizations involved include CE
     (electrical, water, sewer, and gas), Air Force Element Launch Communications (fiber),
     commercial providers (cable television, natural gas, electrical, water), and Installation
     Management among others.
     4.2.1.5. The requester is responsible for clearly marking the planned excavation prior to
     organizations coming out to mark utilities. The requester is also responsible for
     maintaining markings.
        4.2.1.5.1. Planned excavations must be marked IAW USA guidelines using the
        appropriate color-coded, chalk-based paint or colored/flagged stakes. Color-code for
        marking underground utility lines: Red – Electric; Yellow – Gas/Oil/Steam; Orange –
        Communication/CATV; Blue – Water; Green – Sewer; Pink – Temporary Survey
        Markings; White – Proposed Excavation Boundaries.
        4.2.1.5.2. If an unmarked utility is located, the excavator will stop work and notify the
        utility representative immediately. If any utility is damaged, the excavator must
        immediately notify CEOER and the agency that owns the utility and provide the
        location, type of utility damaged (if known), extent of damage, name and phone
        number where excavator can be reached.
        4.2.1.5.3. The excavator must contact USA to renew any non-base-owned utility
        markings (such as GTE) in the field and must report any renewal information to a
        CEOER representative.
        4.2.1.5.4. Unless otherwise stated in Government contract documents or by the
        responsible organization, the excavator shall hand dig within five feet on either side of
        the marked utility.
        4.2.1.5.5. Power equipment may be used where utilities are noted to remove existing
        pavement or floor surface, if it has been determined that there are no utilities in the
        pavement or floor and to break the surface of the soil (top four inches).
     4.2.1.6. If the utility is not found after hand excavating 60 inches on each side of the mark
     indicating the utility location, the excavator will contact the appropriate utility
     representative for a more precise location. If the utility still cannot be found, the excavator
     may proceed cautiously under advisement of the utility owner (Note: The 60 inch boundary
     does not apply to depth; the excavator will be held liable for any damage to utilities within
     the marked area).
30SWI32-1001 9 OCTOBER 2013                                                                25


     4.2.1.7. Aircraft or Vehicular Traffic Interruptions. If proposed work interrupts traffic,
     whether aircraft or vehicular, a work clearance must be sought. Road closures and traffic
     pattern modifications must be coordinated through 30 SW Public Affairs for base-wide
     notification. Contact Public Affairs at 606-3595 for more details. Any work near the
     airfield that could impact air operations must be coordinated through Base Operations.
     4.2.1.8. Fire and Intrusion Alarm Interruptions. Any work with the potential to affect fire
     alarm systems will be coordinated with the Fire Department and 30 CES/CEOFA (Alarm
     Shop) representatives. Any work with the potential to affect intrusion alarm systems will
     be coordinated with 30 SFS and 30 CES/CEOFA (Alarm Shop) representatives.
     4.2.1.9. Interior/Exterior Environmentally Sensitive Work. Any work which will include
     demolition, HAZMAT abatement, or the potential to disrupt vegetation, wildlife and/or
     habitat, archaeological sites, HAZMAT, electrical, HVAC, or other interior utilities must
     be coordinated through the Comprehensive Planning office (30 CES/CENPL) and
     Environmental (30 CES/CEIE).
     4.2.1.10. Removal of Temporary Facilities. Demolition projects, to include removal of
     temporary facilities, require notification to the Air Pollution Control District (APCD). If
     the temporary facility meets the below criteria, the APCD can treat the temporary facility
     as a unit exempted from notification. The APCD requires an email or written statement
     attesting to the below criteria prior to the temporary facility being moved. The 30 CES
     Installation Management is the point of contact for these notifications. If a facility is
     thought to be covered by this exemption, please contact 30 CES/CEIE. Exception criteria:
        4.2.1.10.1. It must have been on-site less than one calendar year;
        4.2.1.10.2. It is a single unit and not a double-wide or multiple units;
        4.2.1.10.3. It has a trailer tongue and wheels or it is being "moved", not actually
        demolished or burned; or
        4.2.1.10.4. It has not been placed onto a permanent foundation.
     4.2.1.11. CE Customer Service maintains a list of all required organizations and contacts
     for coordination of the AF Form 103.

5.2. Computer Resources. There are several locations on the network where facility managers
can go to access helpful information. The first is a shared folder CEOER maintains that houses
facility manager information such as needed forms, facility manager guidance, training slides, the
current facility manager list, and any other information or guidance that could be useful for a
facility manger to have.           The folder can be found in a shared location at
\\vafbfile5\30cesfiles\30_CES_FACILITY_MANAGER_PROGRAM.                        The      Installation
Management Flight has also created a very useful website on the Intranet that provides information
on Installation Management Flight issues and policies. It is located on the intranet at
https://intranet/30_msg/30-ces/Environmental/index.asp.
