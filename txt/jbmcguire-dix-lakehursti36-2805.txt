   9.1. Board members will review each package and score each section based solely on the
   information required in paragraph 7 and the guidance in Attachment 12 of this instruction.
   Each nominee’s total score will be calculated to determine relative ranking with the other
   nominees. Board members will annotate their rankings on their score sheet (Attachments 2,
   4 or 6), sign and return it to the board president. Board members are encouraged to discuss
   the points/rankings and attempt to resolve any ties. If a tie cannot be broken by the voting
   members, the board president will break the tie.
   9.2. The board president’s rankings will only be used in the event of a tie. The board
   president will review each package and score each section IAW Table 9.1. of this instruction.
   The board president will use the Board President Score Sheet, Attachments 3, 5 or 7. The
   board president may only use the ranking each board member has assigned to the nominees.
   The rankings will be totaled and the member with the lowest total will be forwarded to the 87
   ABW/CC for final selection.

                            GUIDE FOR BOARD EVALUATIONS

A12.1. Selection: Selection will be based on a combination of the AF Form 1206 (80 points)
and the personal board interview (20 points). When required, the board president will facilitate
open discussion to resolve any disparities that could skew the scoring process.
   A12.1.1. AF Form 1206, Nomination for Award: Effective evaluation of the AF Form 1206
   requires a detailed thought process; it is challenging to review nomination packages and
   determine who are the “Best of the Best.” Each board member must remember it is not the
   writer; it is the accomplishment of the nominee which makes the difference. Strong emphasis
   must be on initiative, achievement and impact, not writing style. When evaluating an AF
   Form 1206, the individual’s quarterly write-up cannot exceed 15 lines (including the three
   category headings) or no more than 30 lines for annual awards (including headings).
   Attachments 8 - 11 contain the required distribution of lines. If bullets exceed the allotted
   lines per category, excess bullets will be lined through from the bottom up and not evaluated.
   The total possible points that can be awarded are 80. The three approved categories listed
   below will be scored. Each line will be evaluated on its own merit as it relates within the
   respective category. Board members may award maximum points to each section using
   whole or half point increments. Board presidents must break all ties.
Heading                                                                       Point Value
Leadership and Job Performance in Primary Duty                                1 – 60
Significant Self-Improvement                                                  1 – 10
Base or Community Involvement                                                 1 – 10
       A12.1.1.1. Leadership and Job Performance in Primary Duty. The individual’s primary
       duty accomplishments are the most important element of the nomination package. This is
       the most difficult section to score because everyone does an outstanding job in his or her
       area of expertise. Below are guidelines to assist board members in differentiating the
       impact on the mission and leadership role.
Impact on the entire JB-MDL team
Innovative methods/programs developed, designed, implemented and impact
Process Improvement – cost savings, percentage improved or reduced
Superior leadership or training skills
Quantification and qualification of results
Key additional duties with significant impact
Wing working group or committee chair/member
Higher HQ, service unique or DoD involvement
Unit/Wing/Group/command-level and higher awards (both individual and unit; deployed or
home station)

       A12.1.1.2. Significant Self Improvement. The primary focus of this section is the
       individual’s professional and personal development and how it benefits the USAF. The
JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTI36-2805 23 OCTOBER 2014                                                    23


       key factors to this category are individual commitment level and personal sacrifice. You
       can judge this by answering the following questions. How much time was expended?
       How much effort was involved? Was the achievement done on duty or during off-duty
       time?
Off-duty Education College (in-residence, on-line, certifications, correspondence classes, etc.)
Upgrade Training (5-level completion, CDC progress, formal training courses, etc.)
Advanced career field or Military Occupational Specialty training
Readiness training
Conference or symposiums related to job or career field/specialty (how nominee used
information to improve process, mission impact, etc.)

       A12.1.1.3. Base or Community Involvement. This section rounds out the whole person
       concept. Unit and base activities/support should be weighed more heavily on community
       involvement because they directly impact the Joint Base and the surrounding community.
       Again, the individual’s commitment level and personal sacrifice are key factors in
       evaluating this section. How much time and effort was involved? What was the amount
       of time committed to the achievement and the frequency? Did the member participate or
       lead the effort?
Involvement in professional organizations
Key leadership position on executive council coupled by the achievement or results
Color/Honor Guard and sustained participation
Leadership position or role in community
Special Olympics, Boy Scouts, Big Brother/Sister, etc. (Number of hours and frequency)
Coaching sporting teams (squadron intramural teams, adult or youth programs, etc.)
Participating in major community ceremonies such as unit member retirement, POW/MIA vigil,
retreat, marched in community parade while in uniform (i.e., Veteran’s Day, Fourth of July, and
Liberation Day)
Base Sponsored Programs
Quarterly/Annual Awards Committee

   A12.1.2. Face-to-Face Interview. The primary purpose of the face-to-face board is to ensure
   nominees’ dress and appearance, military bearing, oral expression and articulation of
   responses. This is a very subjective area for board members to evaluate and you must
   baseline your judgment against military standards. The total possible points that can be
   awarded are 20. The three approved categories listed below will be scored.
Category                                                                      Point Value
Military Bearing                                                              1–5
Dress and Appearance                                                          1–5
Communication Skills                                                          1 – 10

contacting the board members to provide instructions in regards to preparing board questions.
The 87 ABW/CCCE will task each of the board members with a specific category (see below for
categories). Board members are to prepare two questions for their respective tasked board
category. Questions will be opinionated and fact based, thought provoking, and designed to
assess the nominee’s ability to organize thoughts and articulate a response. The board president
will have the nominee stand and recite the Airmen’s Creed after all questions have been
concluded and before dismissal. Questions will come from some or all of the following study
areas:
   A12.2.1. Questions for the Airman Category:
       A12.2.1.1. Current Events. General knowledge of current AF, command and base news
       or world events and their opinions regarding these items (for example: Operation

       CMSAF Viewpoints, etc.). Current Events will only cover the time period within one
       week of the scheduled board date.

       successes of their unit (this is an excellent opportunity to gather background information
       on the nominee). Use the nominee’s AF Form 1206 to prepare these questions.

                                  MEETING THE BOARD

  1. Be early. Stand while you wait--do not sit down. If possible, carry your uniform to the
     board and change just before you meet the board.

  2. When you arrive, there will be an official greeter, probably standing outside the meeting
     room. He/she should inform you who is on the board, what the reporting instructions are,
     and any other special instructions. If not, ASK!

  3. Do not take your hat or purse into the room.

  4. If you are instructed to knock before entering, knock only once, but firmly.

  5. When you open the door, take a good look at the room. Look for the chair you will be
     sitting in. Walk the most direct route to position yourself in the front of the chair facing
     the board president. Do not stop and perform a facing movement, stop in place. Save the
     facing movement for your departure. Look directly at the president, salute (if it’s an
     officer) and say, “Sir/Ma’am, Airman ___________ reports to the Quarterly Awards
     board.” The Board President will return your salute (if officer) and instruct you to be
     seated.

  6. Back up until you feel the calves of your legs touch the chair. Do not look back or down.
     Don’t turn your back to the board members until you are departing.

  7. Sit in the middle of the chair, not on the edge or all the way back.

  8. Sit at attention and place your hands on your thighs. The idea is to be erect and alert, but
     not rigid. NEVER slouch or recline, even though the Board President may tell you to
     relax. Do not tap fingers, crack knuckles, play with rings, wipe sweaty palms, etc.

  9. Do not cross your legs. Place one foot slightly in front of the other.

  10. Smile and establish rapport with the board.

  11. When answering questions, do not turn your body. Turn your head toward the person
     asking the question and then pan the board members when giving your answer. Good eye
     contact with all the board members is very important.
28                         JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTI36-2805 23 OCTOBER 2014


  12. The first questions are usually relaxing icebreakers, such as, “Where are you from?” or
     “Where do you work?”

  13. After being asked a question, repeat the question if appropriate and preface your answer
     with 'Sir/Ma'am/Chief.' Try to give more than the basic answer, the board members are
     looking for evidence that you can articulate and think on your feet.

  14. If you do not understand a question, ask the board member to repeat it. If you do not
     know the answer at that point, ask to return to the question later. If you know part of the
     answer, getting partial credit is better than none at all. Lastly, if you flat don't know,
     simply tell the board you are unable to answer the question at this time.

  15. When answering opinion type questions, give a thoughtfully considered one. Tell the
     board members whether or not your opinion is in line with current policy. Most
     importantly, defend your position with logic, fact and personal experience, not emotion.
     Be tactful, don’t crusade, and don’t apologize.

  16. If the board asks you if you have any comments, thank them for their time and add any
     other comments that may be appropriate.

  17. When you are finished, the president will say “Airman ____________, you are
     dismissed.”

         a. Answer, 'Thank you Sir/Ma'am'.

         b. Push down on your thighs with your hands, stand up, and look directly at the
             president.

         c. Salute (if an officer) and wait for the salute to be returned. If the president is
             enlisted, nod your head once.

         d. Perform the appropriate facing movement to put you in direct line with the door.
             Exit the room smartly, marching with coordinated arm swing.
JBMCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURSTI36-2805 23 OCTOBER 2014                                              29


   18. Summary
   19. Be yourself. The board wants to know you. You must believe you are worthy of Below
       the Zone promotion—and you are a WINNER. Someone else believed it; otherwise they
       would not have taken the time to nominate you.

pinned away.
Males and Females, are ID bracelets, rings, excessive items from pockets
removed?
**Note if it is raining the day of the board, carry your uniform and shoes in
with you and change on site. This will ensure you present a clean, professional
image.
