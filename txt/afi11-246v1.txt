runway, or a runway with length greater than 10,000 feet is within 80nm of the staging location
and show site. For the F-22 Demonstration team: All show sites (regardless of runway length)
must have either a suitable arresting gear (BAK-12 or equivalent) on site or at a 7000 feet or
greater runway within 80nm of the staging location and show site.

1.9. Reporting.
   1.9.1. Any unusual occurrence (In-Flight Emergencies, Aborts/KIO, weather cancellations,
   FAA profile violations, or any safety-of-flight-related issue) will be reported by the pilot,
   narrator, ground safety observer, or NCOIC via phone, fax, or email ASAP to the MAJCOM
   Aerial Events office.
   1.9.2. Submit End of Show Summaries and Critiques to MAJCOM Aerial Events NLT 1
   week after each show IAW the MAJCOM approved format. See sample at Attachment 2.
1.10. Recommended Changes.
   1.10.1. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
   Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
   Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of
   command to HQ ACC/A3T.
      1.10.1.1. Recommendations for new or modified maneuvers not detailed in this
      instruction will be forwarded through the WG/CC to the MAJCOM/A3 for concept
      approval before proceeding with simulator testing and development of detailed
      parameters and abort procedures. Following MAJCOM/A3 concept approval, new
      maneuvers will be developed by the demo pilot and evaluated in the simulator prior to
      flight. Demo pilots must obtain WG/CC approval prior to flight testing. This approval
      will be documented in the grade book. Once parameters have been established and the
      maneuver has been flown satisfactorily in the simulator, demo pilots will fly and evaluate
      maneuvers in working airspace greater than 5,000’ AGL and then again at greater than
      2,000’ AGL. Once safety evaluation has been accomplished in working airspace, demo
      pilots will fly the maneuver over the airfield at or above 1,000’ AGL and again at 500’
      AGL, prior to flying the maneuver at maneuver minimums. All maneuver evaluations
      will be documented on a grade sheet and maintained in the demo pilot’s gradebook. Once
      the maneuver is perfected in practice, a change to this AFI will be submitted IAW
      paragraph 1.10.1 Demo pilots will not perform new or modified maneuvers in actual
      demonstrations unless approved by MAJCOM/CC.
   1.10.2. Each demonstration team may supplement this instruction as necessary. Team
   organization, maintenance support, selection criteria, and training programs for new pilots
   are examples of items that may be supplemented. Submit supplements or operating
   instructions to HQ ACC/A3TA for coordination prior to publication.
1.11. Demonstration Performance Reviews / Grade Sheets.
   1.11.1. Every practice and demonstration at locations with appropriate level of classified
   storage capability, to include all home station demonstration sorties, will be recorded on the
   pilot’s HUD tape. Every practice and demonstration involving aerobatics of any kind
   conducted below 2,000 feet AGL will be videotaped. Video will not be posted to any public
   web site until approved by MAJCOM/PA. Each demonstration will be debriefed using these
   videotapes and HUD when available. Demonstration pilots will use the approved Microsoft
   Excel grade sheet to evaluate each flight. MAJCOM/CC or A3 may request a videotape and
   HUD tape for review at any time during the air show season. Demonstration teams will
   maintain videotapes, and HUD tapes for a minimum of one year. Performance grade sheets
AFI11-246V1 23 OCTOBER 2014                                                                 19


  will be kept at the unit for the duration of demo pilot assignment. Approved grade sheet
  templates will be provided by ACC/A3TA.
  1.11.2. Each maneuver will be graded using a scale of 0 to 4 and averaged to compute an
  overall demonstration grade of 0 to 4. Wing reviewers must comment and make
  recommendations on any maneuver graded zero (0). A maneuver grade of 0 should not be
  automatically considered dangerous unless the manner in which the maneuver was performed
  created a safety of flight situation. However, if safety is compromised then the overall
  demonstration grade will be zero (0). Wing reviewers will recommend additional training for
  any overall demonstration graded zero (0). The average grade for a typical air show should
  be a two (2). The grade sheets will reflect altitude and airspeed to the greatest accuracy
  possible. The following grading criteria will be used to establish individual maneuver and
  overall demonstration grades.
     1.11.2.1. To compute the maneuver grade, “X” equals the distance between the target
     and minimum altitudes. As an example, if the target altitude is 6,000 feet and the
     minimum altitude is 5,000 feet then “X” equals 1000 feet and 1/2X equals 500 feet.
     Grade 0 would be given for all altitudes below 5,000 feet; Grade 1 for all altitudes from
     5,000 to 5,499 feet; Grade 2 for all altitudes 5,500 to 5,999 feet and above 6,501 feet;
     Grade 3 for all altitudes from 6,001 to 6,500 feet; and Grade 4 if altitude equals 6,000
     feet. (Figure 1.1)
     1.11.2.2. GRADE 0 – Altitude below minimum, or airspeed out of limits
     1.11.2.3. GRADE 1 – Altitude >1/2X below target, and airspeed within limits
     1.11.2.4. GRADE 2 – Altitude <1/2X below target or >1/2X above target, and airspeed
     within limits
     1.11.2.5. GRADE 3 – Altitude <1/2X above target, and airspeed +/- 25 knots of target
     1.11.2.6. GRADE 4 – Altitude on target, and airspeed +/- 10 knots of target
     1.11.2.7. Airspeed criteria do not apply to the A-10 unless airspeed is below minimum
     parameter; the maneuver grade is zero.
     1.11.2.8. OVERALL GRADE = Computed average of the maneuver scores.
         1.11.2.8.1. 0 = Dangerous performance
         1.11.2.8.2. 1 = Safe performance, but trend is low
         1.11.2.8.3. 2 = Average performance
         1.11.2.8.4. 3 = Outstanding performance
         1.11.2.8.5. 4 = Perfect performance; no deviations
  1.11.3. Refer to paragraph 1.4.5.9 for wing and HHQ grade sheet and tape review
  requirements.
 20                                                         AFI11-246V1 23 OCTOBER 2014


Figure 1.1. Grading Ranges.




1.12. Proficiency Requirements.
   1.12.1. Demo Pilots: To maintain currency, each pilot will fly a minimum of one
   demonstration every 15-calendar days. A practice session or actual demonstration will be
   scheduled at least once per week during air show season. If the 15 calendar day currency is
   exceeded, the next demonstration will be limited to no-lower-than 1,000 feet AGL target and
   900 feet AGL minimum on all maneuvers, and the operations group commander, deputy
   operations group commander, or WG/CC designee must be present. MAJCOMs may
   determine additional procedures for pilots to regain currency.
   1.12.2. Ground Safety Observers: Perform as ground safety observer for a complete
   maneuver profile at least once every 120 days. Non-current safety observers will execute the
   duties of the safety observer at an official or practice demonstration while under the
   observation of a certified safety observer. This training will be documented in the demo team
   grade book.
   1.12.3. If an actual abort is not encountered, pilot abort procedures must be practiced during
   practice demonstrations at least once each 60 days. For the purpose of meeting this currency
   requirement, during a practice demonstration, the safety observer will initiate the abort call.
AFI11-246V1 23 OCTOBER 2014                                                                      21


1.13. Termination Procedures. Demonstrations involving aerobatics flown below 2,000 feet
AGL will be terminated when:
   1.13.1. The safety observer is unable to monitor the safe performance of maneuvers.
   1.13.2. Two-way radio communication is lost between the demonstration pilot and safety
   observer.
   1.13.3. Videotaping is lost.
   1.13.4. Any time when in the judgment of the pilot or safety observer the safety of the pilot
   or spectators is compromised.
1.14. Transition During Performance. Each demonstration should be planned to fly a
complete high, low, or flat show profile. However, conditions such as a changing ceiling in the
show area may require the demonstration pilot to transition between show profiles at certain
transition points. Frequency of transition between profiles will be determined via MAJCOM
supplement to this directive.
1.15. Altimeter Procedures. It is essential that each demonstration pilot be able to quickly and
accurately assess actual altitude above the ground during any maneuver in the demonstration. To
avoid the mental exercise required to subtract an odd-numbered field elevation from the MSL
altimeter reading to get above ground altitude, one of the two procedures described below will be
used to “zero the altimeters” (QFE). These procedures will be used for all practice and actual
demonstrations whether flown from takeoff at the show site or takeoff from a deployed location.
   1.15.1. Zero Altimeter Method. Dial aircraft altimeter until indicator reads “0”. This
   method will be used if possible.
   1.15.2. Nearest 1,000 Feet Method. If it is not possible to zero the altimeter, dial the
   altimeter to the current altimeter setting for the field, then round up or down to the most
   appropriate 1,000 feet corrected field elevation (500, round down; 501, round up).
1.16. Communication Procedures. The demonstration pilot and safety observer will operate
on a discrete frequency during all practice and official demonstrations. This is to minimize the
amount of third-party radio chatter that can distract the demo pilot and step on required radio
calls from the pilot and safety observer during the demonstration. The safety observer will be the
only person in direct contact with the demo pilot. As such, all other parties must coordinate
through the safety observer for any information needed regarding the demo pilot or the
demonstration. To ensure communications with the appropriate controlling agency (tower or air
boss), the safety observer will monitor the appropriate control frequency. If the safety observer is
engaged in a protracted conversation with the controlling agency that prevents the safety
observer from devoting 100% attention to the primary duty of visually and aurally monitoring
the demonstration, the safety observer will terminate the demonstration. Once the situation has
been resolved and the safety observer can once again give the demonstration 100% attention, the
demonstration may continue.
1.17. Use of Teams for Static Display. The demonstration pilot and narrator/ground safety
observer should normally arrive in two aircraft with one to be used as a spare for the
demonstration. The spare aircraft will not be used for static display since it negates the purpose
of a spare aircraft for the demonstration.
1.18. Disbursement of Demonstration Team Funds. Per MAJCOM supplement.
 22                                                         AFI11-246V1 23 OCTOBER 2014


1.19. Shortened/Modified Demonstrations. On occasion, certain air or trade shows may
require that a demonstration pilot fly a shortened or modified show, due to the time constraints
applicable to the show. MAJCOMs must consider the level of importance of participating in the
show, the anticipated recruiting value, and the complexity involved in shortening a
demonstration profile to determine the cost/benefit of attending the show. Further consideration
should be given to demo pilot proficiency and experience level. A profile may be shortened by
removing, or knocking-off the last few maneuvers. A profile may be modified by removing
maneuvers throughout the profile, but maintaining the sequential flow of the remaining
maneuvers. In no case will a demo pilot fly a shortened or modified profile when request is made
upon arrival at the show site. Four weeks’ notice is required from show POCs for a shortened or
modified profile to be considered, and the show POC will notify the team of the allotted
performance time. The demo pilot will shorten or modify the profile to fit in the allotted time by
removing certain maneuvers, but the maneuvers must flow in the same sequence as the full
profile. Demo pilots will submit a modified profile through command aerial events to
MAJCOM/A3 for approval NLT three weeks prior to the show. (OCONUS MAJCOM/A3s
(PACAF) may delegate the approval authority for modified profiles no lower than WG/CC.
Include delegation of approval authority in the MAJCOM supplement to AFI 11-246, Vol. 1.)
Demo pilots are required to practice modified profiles at least once within ten working days prior
to the show. OG/CC or higher will monitor the practice to note safety considerations and listen to
the narration.
AFI11-246V1 23 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    23


                                           Chapter 2

        DEMONSTRATION TEAM PERSONNEL SELECTION AND TRAINING

2.1. General. MAJCOMs will provide team description and location via supplement. A
standard team includes two aircraft, one demonstration pilot, a minimum of two narrators, two
safety observers, and necessary support personnel. Team will deploy with a ground safety
observer. Ground safety observers will not simultaneously perform narration duties. Team
selection should consider factors affecting assignment stability such as vulnerability for schools
or overseas assignment.
2.2. Demonstration Pilot Selection. New demonstration pilots will normally be selected by
Wing Commanders in August and enter training no later than September prior to the new pilot’s
first air show season. Demonstration pilot duty is normally a two-year assignment.
2.3. Narrator/Ground Safety Observer Selection.
   2.3.1. Narrators will be selected by the wing commander. To reduce the impact on flying
   operations by minimizing the number of pilots per TDY, consideration should be given to
   select non-rated officers or NCOs as the narrator. The narrator tour of duty is a minimum of
   one year.
   2.3.2. Ground safety observers must be rated officers current and qualified in the MDS.
   Ground safety observers will be selected by wing commanders during training season for
   upgrade training in preparation for the following air show season. Demo teams will be
   limited to a maximum of six ground safety observers to ensure sufficient currency and
   proficiency for each. The normal ground safety observer tour of duty is one year. New
   ground safety observers may be trained during mid-season for PCS/deployment reasons if
   necessary, but the maximum number remains six. All ground safety observer names will be
   recorded in the demo team grade book.
2.4. Support Personnel Selection. Support personnel are selected by the wing commander. As
new enlisted personnel are assigned to the demonstration teams, it is appropriate to request
assignment deferments. However, since AFPC’s support/approval of the deferments is directly
linked to overseas assignment vulnerability, it is strongly recommended that prospective local
candidates be verified by the MAJCOM Airman Assignments Branch before they are firmly
hired. A cursory check with AFPC can prevent the WG/CC from hiring people for the team who
are extremely vulnerable for PCS.
2.5. Training. Training will be accomplished according to the guidelines of this instruction and
as supplemented.
   2.5.1. The Wing commander may alter the training sequence and individual sorties, as
   necessary, to ensure proficiency and progress. Additional training sorties (TS) may be added
   as required.
   2.5.2. Maneuvers and maneuver sequences will be performed as described in this AFI. New
   demonstration pilots will demonstrate proficiency in the high, low, and flat show profiles.
24                                                          AFI11-246V1 23 OCTOBER 2014


  2.5.3. New demonstration pilots will receive flight training from a currently qualified
  demonstration pilot. Each new demonstration pilot will receive extensive ground training
  from their predecessor or a currently qualified demonstration pilot.
  2.5.4. New demonstration pilots will receive training in aircraft flight control limitations and
  performance characteristics affecting the demonstration profile. New demonstration pilots
  will receive training on common conditions leading to aborts for each maneuver. F-16
  demonstration pilots will receive training on the flight control system, FLCS limiters and
  their effect on level flight, and sustaining inverted level flight at <165 KCAS.
  2.5.5. New demonstration pilots and ground safety observers will receive academic and
  flight training for abort procedures. Furthermore, the established abort procedures will be
  standardized by MDS. Demonstration pilots will conduct a minimum of three abort
  procedures during upgrade sorties TS-5 through TS-11.
  2.5.6. New demonstration pilots who will fly off-station demonstrations will attend a
  minimum of two air shows with the current demonstration pilot. If possible, the new pilot
  will fly with the current demonstration pilot in each air show practice demonstration (N/A for
  A-10 & F-22).
  2.5.7. A-10 and F-22 will use a chase aircraft for TS-3 and TS-4. A chase aircraft may be
  used for missions TS-5 through TS-11, or the instructor may observe from the ground. The
  minimum altitude for chase aircraft is 1,500 feet AGL.
  2.5.8. For F-15E & F-16 the currently qualified demonstration pilot monitoring the training
  program will observe the first solo training flight from the ground, and may act as the safety
  observer.
  2.5.9. All training will be accomplished in VMC. Each practice, except TS-3 and TS-4, will
  be over a runway environment. All training flights below 2,000 feet AGL will be videotaped.
  2.5.10. Demonstration team film crews will be thoroughly trained. Training should
  emphasize equipment operation, sound techniques to capture demonstration narration, and
  techniques to capture the ground environment in the field of view during low altitude
  maneuvers.
  2.5.11. Training performance will be documented in an official grade book and progress
  monitored by the wing commander. All training flights will be reviewed by the senior
  leadership IAW paragraph 1.4.5.9
  2.5.12. Final wing commander review, pre/re-certification of the demonstration crew and
  ground safety observer will be documented and forwarded by the wing commander IAW
  paragraph 1.4.5.3 or 1.4.5.4 First-year pilots who will fly demonstrations off-station must
  accomplish at least one practice flight off home station prior to MAJCOM/CC certification.
  2.5.13. Stage 1 / Stage 2 Altitude Step-down Process:
     2.5.13.1. Definitions: Stage 1: All maneuvers will be flown no lower than a target
     altitude of 500 feet with a minimum altitude of 400 feet. Stage 2: All maneuvers will be
     flown no lower than the target and minimum altitudes described in this AFI.
     2.5.13.2. Upgrading pilots who will fly demonstrations off-station are required to
     practice at a minimum of three separate off-station sites at Stage 1 (higher) altitudes prior
AFI11-246V1 23 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    25


     to the first official public demonstration. The intent of this requirement is for all
     upgrading pilots to gain experience at a minimum of three separate sites in a training
     environment before stepping down to Stage 2 (lower) altitudes off-station in an actual air
     show environment. This requirement only affects off-station practices. All home station
     practices will adhere to the normal altitude step-down procedures set forth in the training
     syllabus. At overseas locations where this requirement is impractical, all practice
     demonstrations may be conducted at home station. However, every attempt will be made
     to satisfy the off-site training requirement before reverting to home field practices only to
     satisfy syllabus requirements.
        2.5.13.2.1. These off-station practices require former demonstration pilot observation
        and/or supervisor observation (no less than OG/CD or WG/CC designee).
        2.5.13.2.2. All ground video or HUD recordings and grade sheets for off-station
        practices require former demonstration pilot and OG/CC or WG/CC designee review.
        2.5.13.2.3. NAF / MAJCOM/CC certifications may be used for partial fulfillment of
        this requirement.
     2.5.13.3. In order to conduct off station demonstrations at stage 2 minimums, upgrading
     demo pilot must first accomplish and document IAW paragraph 2.5.11 the 3 off-station
     practices at stage 1 minimums, and have home station certification at stage 2 minimums.
     This certification must be documented in the upgrading pilot’s grade book.
  2.5.14. Ground Safety Observer Training
     2.5.14.1. During any capability demonstration the ground safety observer is responsible
     to advise the demonstration pilot by radio of any observed or developing unsafe
     condition. This requires intimate knowledge of required maneuver radio calls, maneuver
     parameters, and the timing of maneuvers so that safety observer radio calls provide
     timely correction to an observed or developing deviation from procedure or direction
     prescribed in this publication. Safety observers will complete a closed-book parameters
     test for those maneuvers requiring parameter radio calls, corrected to 100 percent by a
     current demo pilot, prior to performing duties solo. This training will be documented in
     the demo team grade book.
     2.5.14.2. To increase "air show situational awareness" and improve the mutual support
     with the demo pilot, ground safety observers will have a working knowledge of the
     following subjects: air show airspace; the aerobatic box; show lines; crowd lines;
     applicable FARs that require waiver; interaction with the air boss; and air show
     communication plans. These subjects will be reviewed by upgrading safety observers,
     and briefed by current demo pilots, using the Safety Observer academics provided by the
     MAJCOM. This training will be documented in the demo team grade book prior to
     performing duties solo. In addition, it is recommended that at least one ground safety
     observer per base attend the Air Shows 101 course at ICAS each year. Ground safety
     observers must also be familiar with all applicable procedures and parameters relevant to
     MDS in this publication.
     2.5.14.3. Upgrading safety observers must complete a two-sortie checkout. For the first
     sortie, the upgrading safety observer will observe a certified ground safety observer
     during an official or practice high show demonstration. For the second sortie, the
 26                                                      AFI11-246V1 23 OCTOBER 2014


      upgrading ground safety observer will execute the duties of the safety observer at an
      official or practice high show demonstration while under the observation of a certified
      safety observer. This training will be documented in the demo team grade book.

                          A-10 DEMONSTRATION MANEUVERS

Section 3A—-General Information

3.1. General. Maneuvers described in this chapter will be used for training and for A-10 aerial
demonstrations. The demonstration sequence is designed so each maneuver is normally
performed in the same direction with respect to the crowd line. As a result, the show is always
oriented the same way from the spectators' point of view. The only exception to this is when
wind direction and velocity make it advantageous to change the direction of the gear down pass.
In this case, the remaining maneuvers may be flown in the opposite direction, or repositions may
be used to fly the remaining maneuvers in the appropriate direction. Abnormal Procedures are
written for each maneuver. If the entry conditions are not met for any maneuver, a wings-level
pass will be flown and the pilot will transition to the next maneuver. Demonstration pilots will
transmit parameters prior to initiating the descending portion of vertical pull-throughs and
Vertical Reposition maneuvers. These calls will be made when the pilot reaches apex of the
maneuver. Ground safety observer will monitor demonstration pilot altitude and airspeed radio
calls and direct an abort when parameter limits are exceeded. Following all maneuvers and
before clearing the show line to reposition for the next maneuver, the pilot will ensure any
descent has been stopped and the aircraft is in a climbing or level attitude with the flight path
marker at or above the horizon.
3.2. Aircraft Configuration and Fuel Requirements. Aircraft configuration for all
demonstrations will be clean. Each demonstration uses approximately 1,000 pounds of fuel.
Optimum performance is obtained when fuel load is 3,500 pounds; however, the demonstration
can be safely accomplished with a higher fuel load as long as the wing tanks are empty. The
minimum fuel to start the show is 2,500 pounds.
3.3. Airspeed and G Limits. The A-10 demonstration is flown at max power except when
slowing to configure for the gear down pass or slowing to configure for the minimum run
landing. The maximum Target G for this demonstration profile is 6.0 Gs. This does not preclude
a momentary increase in G for safety considerations.
3.4. Show Line Restrictions. The majority of the A-10 demonstration will be flown on the
1,500-foot show line. Maneuvers not conforming to FAA Order 8900.1, Volume 3, Chapter 6,
must be approved via the FAA AFS-800 Maneuver Package approval process.
3.5. Airspace and Runway Requirements. Required airspace for the A-10 is 7,000 feet AGL
vertically and normally a five-mile radius from show center horizontally. The minimum
dimensions of the aerobatic box are 3,000 feet wide, 4,000 feet long, and 7,000 feet AGL (high
show). If the FAA has waived a show line to closer than 1,500 feet, the aerobatic box may be
less than 3,000 feet wide, provided there is at least 1,200 feet from either the primary or
secondary show line. Minimum runway length is 5,000 feet x 75 feet. The runway, taxiway, and
parking area must be stressed for a 35,000-pound aircraft with single wheel type landing gear.
3.6. Weather Requirements. Weather PARAMETER LIMITS for the high show profile are a
ceiling of at least 5,000 feet, 3 miles ground and 5 miles in-flight visibility with a discernible
horizon. The low show profile ceiling is at least 3,500 feet. The flat show profile ceiling is at
AFI11-246V1 23 OCTOBER 2014                                                                  29


least 1,500 feet. The ceiling requirements for each maneuver are based on waived airspace (clear
of clouds) and must be adjusted if using VFR rules. Maneuvers will be planned to maintain
VMC throughout the show sequence.

   3.8.1. Maneuver Description: The Repositioning Turn uses both horizontal and vertical
   turning room to change direction at each end of the show line. The vertical plane is used to
   maintain necessary proximity to the demonstration area. Each turn may differ slightly in
   order to meet entry TARGET PARAMETERS for the next maneuver and attain the proper
   show line alignment. To begin the maneuver, turn 15 to 45 degrees away from the crowd
   (depending on environmental conditions), rollout, and pull to 45 degrees nose high, and then
   unload. At 1,000 feet minimum, execute a 270-degree aileron roll opposite the show line.
   Visually acquire the show line and make a descending turn to meet the entry TARGET
   PARAMETERS for the next maneuver. Repositioning turns may not include added aileron
   rolls or other accenting maneuvers.
   3.8.2. Abnormal Procedures: If at any time the minimum altitude, airspeed, or climb
   angles, cannot be achieved or maintained, roll the aircraft to the nearest horizon and recover
   to wings- level flight.

   3.9.1. Maneuver Description: Initiate a 75 to 90-degree bank turn away from the crowd to
   45 degrees off the show line. (The maneuver may be flown behind the show line dependent
   upon the location of the local populace.) Once at the 45-degree turn point, initiate a 5.0 to
   6.0-G pull to 45 degrees of climb (55 degrees maximum) and climb out 120 to 150 knots
   (120 knots minimum). At 3,500 feet AGL, initiate a 45-degree dive (55 degrees maximum)
   back to the appropriate show line for the next maneuver. Exit from the High Speed
   Reposition Maneuver by pulling at 1,200 feet using 5.0 to 6.0 Gs to level off at the
   appropriate entry altitude for the next maneuver.
   3.9.2. Abnormal Procedures: If at any time the minimum altitude, airspeed, or climb
   angles cannot be achieved or maintained, roll the aircraft to the nearest horizon and recover
   to wings-level flight.
3.10. Flat Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver. The Flat Wifferdill Maneuver turn is a
combination horizontal and shallow vertical turn used to change direction at each end of the
show line. The Flat Wifferdill Maneuver turn uses less altitude than a normal Repositioning
Maneuver. It requires a larger cut and tends to be looser and flatter than a normal Repositioning
Maneuver. The target G for this maneuver is 3 to 5 Gs. Each turn may differ slightly so that
airspeed/altitude parameters for the next maneuver are established in the Flat Wifferdill. The
entry "cut" turn for the Flat Wifferdill is made to ensure no show line or crowd line penetration.

   3.11.1. Maneuver Description: Accomplish a normal takeoff with 7-degree flaps. The
   rotation airspeed is 110 knots and should be accomplished using a smooth, continuous pull to
   obtain the normal takeoff attitude. Raise the gear with a positive rate of climb and retract the
   flaps once the gear is up and the gear horn is out. After gear and flap retraction, level off at
   30 feet and accelerate to a minimum of 175 knots. At show center or the end of the runway,
   with a minimum of 175 knots, pull up 30 to 45 degrees nose high using 3.0 to 4.0 Gs or the
   steady stall warning tone. Turn 15 to 45 degrees away from the crowd and continue climb
   out.
   3.11.2. Abnormal Procedures: Use caution when taking off from short runways, runways
   at high density altitudes, or wet runways. TOLD data is critical and must be computed very
   carefully at each show site. Do not fly if refusal speed is less than continuation speed. During
   the climb out, if the aircraft stalls or the airspeed falls below 110 knots (whichever occurs
   first), unload and accelerate to break the stall and/or increase airspeed to a minimum of 110
   knots. Climb out can then be continued.

   3.12.1. Maneuver Description: The Flat Pass is a maneuver used alone or in combination
   with a Wifferdill/Reposition for the purposes of displaying the aircraft or orienting the
   subsequent demonstration maneuver in the approved direction relative to the crowd line. It
   may be flown in either direction at any time during the demonstration sequence if required. It
   should be flown wings-level down the 500-foot show line at 300 feet AGL.
   3.12.2. Abnormal Procedures: If any problems are encountered, the demo pilot should
   begin an immediate climbing turn away from the crowd.

   3.13.1. Maneuver Description: After completion of the Flat Pass and on the 1,500’ show
   line, pull up to 90 degrees nose-high using 5.0 to 6.0 Gs, unload, and execute a 540-degree
   roll. Once the roll is complete, pull the aircraft gently over onto its back and roll upright at
   no less than 110 knots. Drive straight ahead and attain target entry parameters for the next
   maneuver.
   3.13.2. Abnormal Procedures: Vary the angle of climb for wind, weather, and aerobatic-
   box considerations. If at any time during the maneuver it appears the maneuver will not
   attain the prescribed altitude or airspeed minimums over the top, the maneuver will be
   aborted by performing a nose-high recovery IAW tech order procedure.

   3.14.1. Maneuver Description: (High Show only) On the 1,500’ show line, after reaching
   the planned entry parameters of 5,500’ AGL, perform an unloaded roll to inverted and
   perform an aggressive 90-degree pull to vertical. At 90 degrees nose-low execute a
   maximum rate unloaded 360-degree roll to be complete by 3,000’ AGL. Continue an
   aggressive pull to no greater than 45 degrees nose-low. Once recovery above the minimum
   altitude for the follow-on maneuver is assured, vary the G-loading and dive angle as
   necessary to meet the entry parameters for the next maneuver. As a technique, passing
   approximately 1,200’ AGL begin a 5 to 6-G pull to level off at 500’ AGL.
   3.14.2. Abnormal Procedures: If the entry parameters are not met, the pilot will transition
   to a wings-level flat pass or perform a slice-back as appropriate. If 5,500’ is not met, do not
   attempt the 360-degree roll on the down line and perform a traditional Split-S. Do not
   attempt to pull down from the inverted apex below 4,500’ AGL or with more than 250 KIAS.
   If at any time, before reaching the 45 degrees nose-low position, the aircraft exceeds 375
   knots, reduce the throttles and open the speed brakes to slow the aircraft to approximately
   350 knots. If any other altitude, airspeed, or dive angle restrictions cannot be met,
   immediately execute a nose-low recovery by reducing the throttles to idle, opening the speed
   brakes, and rolling the aircraft upright to the nearest horizon.

   3.15.1. Maneuver Description: Enter the double aileron roll from wings-level flight at
   500’ AGL on the 1,500’ show line. At 3,000 feet prior to show center, initiate a smooth 5 to
   9-degree climb. As show center approaches the mid-point of the corner panel, unload the
   aircraft to 0 G and execute two 360-degree aileron rolls in either direction.

   3.15.2. Abnormal Procedures: Abort the maneuver if at any time the nose falls more than
   8 degrees below the horizon or the nose drops below the horizon prior to the beginning of the
   second roll. Aborting the maneuver is accomplished by rolling towards the nearest horizon
   to wings-level and climbing to ensure recovery at or above minimum altitude is achieved.
   Excessive nose drop is most likely to occur during the second half of the roll due to
   insufficient negative stick pressure, and a decrease in airspeed resulting in less control
   surface effectiveness.

   3.16.1. Maneuver Description: Position the aircraft on the 1,500’ show line at 500’ AGL
   and 325 knots using a reposition maneuver. Approximately 2,000’ prior to show center,
   initiate an 8 to10-degree nose-high climb and begin an 8-second coordinated roll to the left.
   Top rudder should be applied approaching 90 degrees, and then slowly fed out as forward
   stick pressure is applied to reach -1 G inverted flight at the 180-degree point. Left rudder is
   slowly fed in through the 270-degree point and slowly fed out to reach upright 1 G flight at
   500’ AGL. Dive angle during the exit should not exceed 8 degrees.
   3.16.2. Abnormal Procedures: Abort the maneuver if at any time the nose falls more than
   8 degrees below the horizon or the nose drops below the horizon prior to the inverted point.
   Aborting the maneuver is accomplished by rolling towards the nearest horizon to wings-level
   and climbing to ensure recovery at or above minimum altitude is achieved. Excessive nose
   drop is most likely to occur during the second half of the roll due to insufficient negative
   stick pressure, and a decrease in airspeed resulting in less control surface effectiveness.

   3.17.1. Maneuver Description: On the 1,500’ show line, with wings level and 500 feet
   AGL begin a smooth 6.0-G pull not to exceed the steady stall warning tone. Minimum apex
   altitude is 3,000 feet AGL with a minimum of 120 knots. Continue the pull until the aircraft
   is 45 degrees nose-low inverted (55 degrees maximum). Due to winds, it may be necessary
   to use more or less than 45 degrees nose-low in order to maintain show center orientation.
   The typical range is between 30 to 55 degrees nose-low. Do not exceed 55 degrees nose-low.
   At or above 3,000’ AGL execute a 2-point hesitation roll on the 45-degree down line. Roll
   wings-level from the 90-degree hesitation point at or above 2,000’ AGL. The 90-degree
   hesitation point requires top rudder to maintain the 45-degree down line and zero G to
   maintain the show line (G may be varied to adjust to the show line). As a technique, passing
   approximately 1,200 feet AGL, begin a 5 to 6.0-G pull to level off at 500 feet AGL. Normal
   apex altitude is 3,500 to 5,000 feet AGL depending upon environmental conditions. The
   second half is completed in the opposite direction.
   3.17.2. Abnormal Procedures: If at any time during the maneuver it appears you will not
   attain the prescribed altitude or airspeed over the top, abort the maneuver by performing an
   unloaded roll to a wings-level position. Furthermore, if more than 45 degrees nose-low
   inverted is required due to winds, add 100 feet for every degree steep to roll-out and pull-out
   altitudes. If more than 55 degrees nose-low, roll out immediately. If unable to reach 45
   degrees nose-low at or above 3,000’ AGL on either half of the Cuban 8, execute a maximum
   rate 180-degree roll to wings-level at 2,500’ AGL and execute recovery as described above.

   3.18.1. Maneuver Description: (High Show Only) On the 1,500’ show line, with wings
   level and 500 feet AGL or greater begin a smooth wings-level 6.0-G pull (not to exceed the
   steady stall warning tone) to a 40 to 70-degree nose-high attitude. At a minimum of 3,000
   feet AGL, perform an unloaded 180-degree aileron roll to achieve an inverted climbing
   attitude. Initiate a smooth pull to the horizon to achieve a wings-level inverted position at
   5,000 feet AGL. Continue the pull through the vertical, using 2.0-4.0 Gs, to 135 degrees of
   turn (45 degrees nose-low). Once recovery above the minimum altitude for the follow on
   maneuver is assured, vary the G-loading and dive angle as necessary to meet the entry
   parameters for the next maneuver. As a technique, passing approximately 1,200’ AGL begin
   a 5 to 6-G pull to level off at 500’ AGL. The ½ Reverse Cuban 8 may be flown as a vertical
   reposition maneuver to change direction at either end of the show line.
   3.18.2. Abnormal Procedures: If the entry parameters are not met, the pilot will transition
   to a wings-level flat pass or perform a slice-back as appropriate. Do not attempt to pull down
   from the inverted apex below 4,500’ AGL or with more than 250 KIAS. If at any time,
   before reaching the 45 degrees nose-low position, the aircraft exceeds 375 knots, reduce the
   throttles and open the speed brakes to slow the aircraft to approximately 350 knots. If any
   other altitude, airspeed, or dive angle restrictions cannot be met, immediately execute a nose-
   low recovery by reducing the throttles to idle, opening the speed brakes, and rolling the
   aircraft upright to the nearest horizon.

   3.19.1. Maneuver Description: Position the aircraft on the 1,500’ show line at 500’ AGL
   and 325 knots. At show center, turn away from the crowd using approximately 85 degrees of
   bank. Begin the turn with a smooth G-onset-rate to maintain 6.0 Gs or the steady stall
   warning horn whichever occurs first. G-loading and airspeed bleed-off rate will vary with
   density altitude. Maintain a minimum of 240 knots. The first 180 degrees of turn should be
   accomplished with a 1 ¾-degree nose-up attitude and the last 180 should be accomplished
   with a 1 ¾-degree nose-down attitude to make the turn appear level to the crowd. Vary the

   bank angle and pitch to arrive at level flight at the completion of 360 degrees of turn and to
   ensure the maneuver is finished above the entry altitude. Surface winds must be taken into
   consideration in order to center this maneuver and to avoid overshooting the show line.
   Continue the turn past 360 degrees as required (usually 30 to 45 additional degrees of turn
   depending on winds) in order to transition to the reposition maneuver used to set up for the
   Gear Down pass.
   3.19.2. Abnormal Procedures: If the minimum entry parameters are not met, the pilot will
   transition to a wings-level flat pass. If during any portion of the maneuver it becomes
   apparent the aircraft will descend below 400 feet AGL or airspeed decay below 240 knots,
   abort the maneuver by rolling wings-level and climbing to 500 feet AGL. If necessary, adjust
   G as required (no lower than 240 knots) to avoid overshooting the show line.

   3.20.1. Maneuver Description: After completion of the Level 360, initiate a turn toward
   the 500-foot show line and begin slowing the aircraft below 200 knots with full speed brakes.
   Upon reaching the base position for the 500-foot show line and below 200 knots, configure
   the aircraft with gear, full flaps, and 40% speed brakes and begin a descent down to 300 feet
   AGL. Continue slowing the aircraft to 120 knots (110 knots minimum) while flying down the
   500-foot show line. When passing the last of the crowd, select max power, close the speed
   brakes, raise the gear, and bring the flaps to seven degrees while maintaining between level
   flight and a slight climb. Passing 150 knots raise the flaps to zero degrees. While level to
   slightly climbing, turn away from the show line to set up for the Pop-Up Strafe Pass using 30
   degrees of bank (45 degrees maximum).
   3.20.2. Abnormal Procedures: If the minimum altitude or airspeed cannot be maintained,
   or the aircraft stalls, abort the maneuver by selecting max power, closing the speed brakes,
   and setting the flaps to MVR. If still sinking, consider engaging the fuel flows to override.

   3.21.1. Maneuver Description: After passing the show line corner marker, turn 30-60
   degrees away from the aerobatic container in order to reposition to a pull-up point from
   behind the show line. As a technique, with show center coordinates as the active steer point,
   drive outbound, 45 degrees off the show line (wind dependent). At 2nm from show center,
   use a flat wifferdill maneuver to head back toward the corner marker with the #2 needle 20
   degrees off heading at 2nm inbound. Maintain that initial heading and use a 6-G pull-up to
   45 degrees nose-high upon reaching 1.3nm. The show center target area should be visually
   acquired during the wifferdill reposition. If unable, the above technique should place the aim
   point just behind the canopy bow and just above the canopy rail during the 45-degree pop.
   Align the aircraft to approach the preplanned strafe target/point from an appropriate angle.
   This angle will normally range from 10 – 30 degrees off the 500-foot show line depending on
   the location of the crowd line and winds. Do not allow a vector towards the crowd! The
   aircraft vector, if extended to infinity, must not penetrate the crowd line. The dive angle will
   normally be 10 – 30 (5 – 15 Flat) degrees nose-low depending on winds. The optimum dive
   angle is 25 (10 Flat) degrees. Do not exceed 30 (15 Flat) degrees. Recovery should be
   initiated at 650 feet AGL using a max performance pull in order to bottom out at or above
   200 feet AGL. Be very careful not to over-G the aircraft during this pull. In order to make
   this corner, a minimum of 250 knots must be obtained. After recovering to level flight,
   accomplish a reposition maneuver to set up for the next strafe pass. Use the 500-foot show
   line at show center as a reference point for setting up each strafe pass. Do not cross the 500-
   foot show line. Depending on winds, this may require aiming 100 – 300 feet outside the 500-
   foot line away from the crowd.
   3.21.2. Abnormal Procedures: If at any time the dive angle exceeds 30 (15 Flat) degrees,
   either abort the pass and fly through straight and level or shift the aim point longer and
   parallel to the show line until the dive angle is 30 (15 Flat) degrees or less. Check airspeed at
   1,000 feet AGL. If it is not at least 230 knots, abort the pass and fly through straight and
   level.

   3.22.1. Maneuver Description: After performing a reposition maneuver, align the aircraft
   to approach the preplanned strafe target/point from an appropriate angle. This angle will
   normally range from 10 – 30 degrees off the 500-foot show line depending on the location of
   the crowd line and winds. Do not allow a vector towards the crowd! The aircraft vector, if
   extended to infinity, must not penetrate the crowd line. The dive angle will normally be 10 –

   careful not to over-G the aircraft during this pull. In order to make this corner, a minimum of
   250 knots must be obtained. After recovering to level flight, accomplish a reposition
   maneuver to set up for the next strafe pass. Use the 500-foot show line at show center as a
   reference point for setting up each strafe pass. Do not cross the 500-foot show line.
   Depending on winds, this may require aiming 100 – 300 feet outside the 500-foot line away
   from the crowd. Following the last strafe pass, transition to the Jink-Out maneuver.
   3.22.2. Abnormal Procedures: If at any time the dive angle exceeds 30 (15 Flat) degrees,
   either abort the pass and fly through straight and level or shift the aim point longer and
   parallel to the show line until the dive angle is 30 (15 Flat) degrees or less. Check airspeed at
   1,000 feet AGL. If it is not at least 230 knots, abort the pass and fly through straight and

   3.23.1. Maneuver Description: Upon completion of the last strafe pass and level at the
   200-foot target altitude, a 75 to 90-degree bank 5.0 to 6.0-G turn is initiated away from the
   crowd to complete a 100 to 135-degree turn to be at or beyond the 1,500-foot show line. At
   the completion of this 100 to 135-degree turn, pull 3.0 to 5.0 Gs up to 40 degrees (55 degrees
   maximum). Once pitch degree is achieved, maintain climb to 2,000 feet AGL, then roll
   inverted and pull to 30 degrees nose-low (40 degrees maximum). Hold till 1,200 feet AGL,
   then roll to the nearest horizon and level-off at 500 feet AGL. The goal of this maneuver is to
   show the Jink-Out in front of show center and be at the 1,500-foot line. In order for this to
   occur, the 100 to 135 degrees of turn is accomplished at a target of 4.0 Gs.
   3.23.2. Abnormal Procedures: If at any time during the maneuver any altitude or
   climb/dive angle will not be maintained, abort by rolling wings-level and climbing away
   from the crowd line.

   3.24.1. Maneuver Description: Enter the Four-Point roll on the 1,500’ show line at 500
   feet AGL and 325 knots. 2,000 feet prior to show center, pull the nose 3 to 5 degrees nose-
   high, establish a climb, and unload. A cadence four-point roll to the left is then performed by
   pausing momentarily at the 90-degree, 180-degree, 270-degree, and 360-degree points. The
   pace of the cadence should ensure the aircraft is at the 180-degree point over show center. In
   order to facilitate sharp transitions between each 90 degrees of roll, momentarily fan the
   speed brakes and unload the aircraft to 0 Gs at the initiation of each roll. Be sure to close the
   speed brakes upon completion of the roll to avoid any unnecessary loss of airspeed. The 90-
   degree and 270-degree points require top rudder to maintain level flight and zero G to
   maintain the show line. The 180-degree point requires 1 negative G in order to maintain level
   flight. This is accomplished using the horizon, not the G-meter.
   3.24.2. Abnormal Procedures: If at any time during the Four-Point Roll, the nose falls
   more than five degrees below the horizon, abort by rolling towards the nearest horizon and a
   wings-level position, then continue down the show line. This would most likely occur during
   the 3rd point (270 degrees) due to a decrease in airspeed, which results in less rudder
   effectiveness.
3.25. Dedication Pass. The intent of this maneuver is to pay tribute to our war fighters. It is to
be flown before the Tactical Pitch-Up to Land during the High, Low, and Flat Show profiles.

   3.25.1. Maneuver Description: The maneuver is flown beyond the 500-foot line. After
   performing the Four-Point Roll or , execute a reposition maneuver on the crowd side to arrive
   behind and offset the crowd. The approach will be flown from behind the line, approximately
   2 miles from show center, with an approximate 30-degree dive angle and a 45-degree cut
   (bank angle 75 to 90 degrees) to the show line, remaining beyond 500 feet from the crowd at
   all times. Upon reaching a point 500 feet from the corner of the crowd and 300 feet AGL, roll
AFI11-246V1 23 OCTOBER 2014                                                                      59


   the aircraft into a level arcing pass using a bank of 75 to 90 degrees. Use top rudder if
   necessary to maintain altitude. Optimum profile of the aircraft is achieved at approximately
   80 degrees of bank. Use caution not to over bank the aircraft and allow the aircraft to lose
   altitude while banking. In order to maintain 500 feet from the crowd at each corner, the flight
   path at show center will have to extend beyond 500 feet. Continue the arc beyond the
   opposite crowd corner, roll out of bank, and continue a maximum 45-degree climb to set up
   for the Tactical Pitch-Up to Landing.
   3.25.2. Abnormal Procedures: Abort the maneuver if at any time the aircraft comes closer
   than 500’ to the crowd line or its lateral limits, an excessive dive angle or sink rate develops,
   entry parameters are not met, or the aircraft descends below 200 feet AGL. Abort the
   maneuver by rolling the aircraft wings-level and flying away from the crowd.

   3.26.1. Maneuver Description: Reposition the aircraft to level off at 300 feet AGL, on the
   500-foot show line at 325 knots (200 knots minimum). Roll into 75 to 90 degrees of bank to
   turn 90 degrees away from the crowd line. Once pointed away from the crowd, pull 5.0 to 6.0
   Gs to 40 degrees nose-high to achieve 1,000 feet AGL minimum. At 1,000 feet AGL
   minimum execute a non-acrobatic 270-degree roll and pull toward the perch point of the
   landing runway. Begin slowing the aircraft and configure for landing with gear, full flaps,
   and 40% speed brakes. Fly a normal base to final (no slower than 135 knots final turn). On
   final, continue slowing to 120 knots (110 minimum) to touchdown. After touchdown,
   perform a minimum run landing by lowering the nose, opening the speed brakes full, and
   initiating full anti-skid braking bringing the aircraft to a complete stop. Plan to do the
   minimum run landing to stop at show center. This is accomplished by planning your
   touchdown point 2,000 feet prior to show center. Do not land 2,000 feet prior to show center
   if, at the point of touchdown, there is less than 5,000 feet of useable runway remaining. In
   this case, plan your touchdown normally in the first 500 feet of runway.          Option: If
   a Heritage Flight is to be performed immediately following completion of the demonstration,
   this maneuver may be deleted and a Flat Pass may be substituted. If not deleted, conduct a
   wings-level low approach or wings-level pass and proceed to rejoin with Heritage Flight
   aircraft using pre-briefed procedures.
   3.26.2. Abnormal Procedures: If airspeeds, altitudes, or stall warning indications are
   experienced with the stick shaker, a Go-Around must be executed to recover the aircraft.
   Once the Go-Around is completed, the pilot will then turn out to downwind (away from the
   crowd) and set up for a normal straight-in to full stop.
3.27. Staged Show Sites. When demonstration aircraft takeoff from other than the air show
site, fuel planning must include the fuel required flying to and from the show site, and any
holding time required. The pilot may enter the show from behind the crowd at a minimum of
1,000 ft AGL as depicted in Figure 3.18, or via a Flat Pass maneuver down the show line, and

complete the show as described in this chapter. Upon completion of the and clearing the crowd,
turn out behind the crowd and return to the staging airport. Pilots should plan to fly a full
demonstration, but may cut the profile short as required to maintain suitable enroute return fuel.

                         F-15E DEMONSTRATION MANEUVERS

Section 4A—-General Information

4.1. General. Maneuvers described in this chapter will be used for training and for F-15E aerial
demonstrations. The demonstration sequence is designed so each maneuver is normally flown in
the same direction with respect to the crowd line with the following exceptions: The Maximum
Performance Takeoff Inverted, Flat Pass, the first Split-S, and the aileron roll preceding the
tactical pitch to landing. As a result, the show is always oriented the same way from the
spectators' point of view. Abnormal procedures are written for each maneuver. If the entry
conditions are not met for any maneuver, a wings-level pass will be flown and the pilot will
transition to the next maneuver. Demonstration pilots will transmit parameters prior to initiating
the descending portion of vertical pull-throughs for the Split-S and Vertical Reposition
Maneuvers. These calls will be made when the pilot reaches apex of the maneuver. Ground
safety observer and the WSO will monitor demonstration pilot altitude and airspeed radio calls
and direct an abort when parameter limits are exceeded. Following all maneuvers and before
clearing the show line to reposition for the next maneuver, the pilot will ensure any descent has
been stopped and the aircraft is in a climbing or level attitude with the flight path marker at or
above the horizon.
4.2. Aircraft Configuration and Fuel Requirements. Aircraft configuration for all
demonstrations will be clean with CFTs, no wing pylons on stations 2 and 8, no LANTIRN pods,
no external fuel tanks, and no travel pods. Fuel considerations include: divert requirements,
cable availability, temperature, and density altitude. Normal minimum fuel for takeoff is:
   4.2.1. Staged Show: 16,500 pounds
   4.2.2. High Show: 14,000 pounds
   4.2.3. Low Show: 13,000 pounds
4.3. Airspeed and G Limits. Demonstration pilots will not exceed 0.94 Mach. The maximum
target G for this demonstration is 7.5 Gs. This does not preclude a momentary increase in G for
safety considerations.
4.4. Show line Restrictions. The majority of the F-15E demonstration will be flown on the
1,500-foot (1,200' if approved by the FAA) show line. Maneuvers not conforming to FAA Order
8900.1, Volume 3, Chapter 6, must be approved via the FAA AFS-800 Maneuver Package
approval process.
4.5. Airspace and Runway Requirements. Required airspace for the F-15E is 15,000 feet
AGL and normally a five-mile radius from show center horizontally. The minimum dimensions
of the aerobatic box are 3,000 feet wide, 6,000 feet long, and 15,000 feet AGL (high show). If
the FAA has waived a show line to closer than 1,500 feet, the aerobatic box may be less than
3,000 feet wide, provided there is at least 1,200 feet from either the primary or secondary show
line. Minimum runway length is 7,000 feet x 75 feet. The runway, taxiway, and parking area
must be stressed for a 62,000-pound aircraft with single wheel type landing gear. If needed, on a
case by case basis, the absolute minimum weight allowable is 52,000-pounds with no CFT gas.

4.6. Weather Requirements. Weather PARAMETER LIMITS for the high profile are a ceiling
of at least 5,000 feet, three miles ground and five miles in-flight visibility with a discernible
horizon. The low show profile ceiling is at least 2,500 feet. The flat show profile ceiling is at
least 1,500 feet. The ceiling requirements for each maneuver are based on waived airspace (clear
of clouds) and must be adjusted if using VFR rules. Maneuvers will be planned to maintain
VMC throughout the show sequence.
4.7. High Density Altitude Demonstrations. For high density altitude shows, adjust
PARAMETER LIMITS in accordance with the following:
   4.7.1. Add 500 feet to APEX altitudes for each 2,000 feet of altitude above 3,000 feet MSL
   and 10 knots to airspeeds. For example, if the show site altitude is 5,000 feet MSL, add 500
   feet to the baseline target and 10 knots to the airspeed. If the show site altitude is 7,000 feet
   MSL, add 1,000 feet to the baseline target and 20 knots to the airspeed.

Figure 4.1. F-15E Flat Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver.




   4.9.1. Flat Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver. The Flat Wifferdill Maneuver turn is a
   combination horizontal and shallow vertical turn used to change direction at each end of the
   show line when performing the low profile. The Flat Wifferdill Maneuver turn uses less
   altitude than a normal Wifferdill. It requires a larger cut and tends to be looser and flatter
   than a normal Wifferdill. 270-degree turn reversal may be made while the aircraft is
   climbing. The target G for this maneuver is 6.5 to 7.0 Gs. Each turn may differ slightly so
   that airspeed/altitude parameters for the next maneuver are established in the flat Wifferdill.
   The entry "cut" turn for the flat Wifferdill is typically made away from the crowd. However
   if local conditions dictate, the turn may be made toward the crowd side, provided the aircraft
   is beyond the corner marker (500' past the edge of the crowd) to ensure no show line or
   crowd line penetration.

   4.9.2. Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver. The Wifferdill turn is a combination horizontal
   and vertical turn used to change direction at each end of the show line. The vertical plane is
   used to maintain necessary proximity to the demonstration area. Each turn may differ
   slightly so that airspeed/altitude parameters for the next maneuver are established in the
   Wifferdill. As the aircraft departs the show line, maneuver in the horizontal and vertical
   plane to reposition for the next maneuver. The target G for this maneuver is 6.5 to 7.0 Gs. A
   270-degree turn reversal is made while still climbing. During the last half of the Wifferdill,
   while descending, the turn is adjusted to establish the proper show line entry. The entry "cut"
   turn for the Wifferdill is typically made away from the crowd. However if local conditions
   dictate, the turn may be made toward the crowd side, provided the aircraft is beyond the
   corner marker (500' past the edge of the crowd) to ensure no show line or crowd line
   penetration.

  4.9.3. Vertical Reposition Maneuver: The Vertical Reposition Maneuver may be flown to
  change direction at each end of the 1,500’ show line. Upon passing show center or at the
  completion of the previous maneuver with a minimum of 350 knots, begin a straight-ahead
  climb using 6.5 to 7.0 Gs to put the aircraft in a 40 to 55-degree nose-high attitude. At a
  minimum of 4,500 feet AGL, perform an unloaded 180-degree roll to achieve an inverted
  climbing attitude. Initiate a smooth pull to the horizon to achieve a wings-level inverted
  position at or above 5,500 feet AGL. Continue the pull in maximum power though the
  vertical, using 3.0-5.0 Gs to 135 degrees of turn (45 degrees nose-low). As the nose drops
  below the horizon and the airfield environment is reacquired, correct as necessary to
  complete the Vertical Reposition Maneuver down the show line. On a standard day, at 90
  degrees nose-low, airspeed should be between 300 to 400 knots and altitude greater than
  4,000 feet AGL. At 135 degrees, backpressure is relaxed and the aircraft smoothly flown to
  be in level flight at 500 feet AGL for the next maneuver. Aircraft power should be
  modulated through the vertical to achieve the desired airspeed upon rollout for the next
  maneuver.
        4.9.3.1. Abnormal Procedures: If not within the target airspeed window, adjust pitch
        attitude during climb to achieve desired airspeed. If below minimum apex altitude,
        maintain an inverted climb until reaching minimum apex altitude. If you will be below
        4,000 feet AGL and over 400 knots prior to achieving 90 degrees nose-low, execute
        emergency dive recovery procedures. If at any time during the maneuver it appears that
        the aircraft will not attain the prescribed altitude/airspeed parameter limits, the maneuver
        will be aborted. Reposition the aircraft for follow-on maneuvering.

   4.10.1. Maneuver Description: The takeoff is performed with flaps and in full afterburner.
   At 190 knots, execute a smooth, but brisk aft-pull of the stick to achieve takeoff rotation.
   After a positive rate of climb is established, retract the gear and flaps and rotate the nose to
   achieve a 23 to 25-unit AOA climb (max AOA 30 units). Smoothly roll and pull away from
   the crowd to a wings-level inverted position with afterburners pointing directly at the crowd.
   Hold inverted flight for approximately five seconds, accelerate to 250 to 400 knots, and then
   perform a 270-degree right turn to position for the Minimum airspeed in the climb will be
   190 knots; minimum altitude inverted will be 800 feet AGL. Option: From inverted flight,
   roll 180 degrees to a wings-level upright position. Delay for approximately 3-5 seconds, and
   then perform a right 270-degree roll to position for the Four-Point Roll.
   4.10.2. Abnormal Procedures: If the show profile takeoff is interrupted by an aircraft
   malfunction, make a normal takeoff, or if conditions warrant, abort the takeoff. NOTES:
   The Max Performance Takeoff/Inverted may be flown in either direction.                A normal
   takeoff may be flown in place of the Max Performance Takeoff (Climb and Inverted) if
   required. Reasons include, but are not limited to: weather (ceiling, visibility, winds) and
   field conditions (rising terrain, high density altitudes, etc.). If flying the normal takeoff to
   accomplish a weather check before starting the actual profile, start the show from a staged
   position.

   4.12.1. Maneuver Description: Beyond the 500’ show line and approximately 3,000 feet
   prior to show center, select full AB and accelerate to approximately 450 knots. At show
   center, turn away from the crowd using approximately 75 to 85 degrees of bank. Begin the
   turn with a smooth G-onset-rate to maintain airspeed at approximately 350 knots and 7.5 Gs.
   G-loading and airspeed bleed-off rate will vary with density altitude. The first 180 degrees
   of turn should be accomplished with a 1 ¾ degree nose-up attitude and the last 180 degrees
   of turn should be accomplished with a 1 ¾ degree nose-down attitude to make the turn
   appear level to the crowd. Vary the bank angle and pitch to arrive at level flight at the
   completion of 360 degrees of turn and to ensure the maneuver is finished on or beyond the
   1,500’ show line and above the entry altitude. Surface winds must be taken into
   consideration in order to center this maneuver on show center and to avoid overshooting the
   show line.
   4.12.2. Abnormal Procedures: If the minimum entry parameters are not met, the pilot will
   transition to a wings-level flat pass. If during any portion of the maneuver it becomes
   apparent the aircraft will descend below 400 feet AGL or airspeed decay below 300 knots,
   abort the maneuver by rolling wings-level and climbing to 500 feet AGL. If necessary,
   adjust power and G as required (no lower than 300 knots) to avoid overshooting the show
   line.

   4.13.1. Maneuver Description: At 4,000 feet prior to show center on the 1,500’ show line
   with 425 knots and a minimum of 500 feet AGL, raise the nose eight degrees, establish a
   climb, and relax stick pressure. Apply full left-stick pressure to perform a maximum of three
   consecutive unloaded aileron rolls. As the second roll is completed, it is important to ensure
   the aircraft has gained altitude and the nose is still above the horizon. At the completion of
   the third roll, roll out and reposition for the Four-Point Roll.
   4.13.2. Abnormal Procedures: If starting parameters are not achieved, abort maneuver and
   transition to a flat pass. If the nose drops below level inverted on the second roll or roll-
   coupling occurs (to exceed approximately 2.5 G) immediately roll wings-level and climb to

   4.14.1. Maneuver Description: At 4,000 feet prior to show center on the 1,500’ show line,
   smoothly pull the nose to five degrees up, establish a climb, and relax stick pressure. A
   cadenced four-point roll to the left is then performed by pausing momentarily at the 90-
   degree, 180-degree, 270-degree, and 360-degree points. Move the stick briskly, causing a
   left roll and an immediate stop at each point when pressure is released. The pace of the
   cadence should ensure the aircraft is at the 180-degree point over show center.
   4.14.2. Abnormal Procedures: If starting parameter limits are not achieved, abort
   maneuver and transition to a flat pass. During the maneuver, if the nose is below the horizon
   at the 180-degree inverted point, abort the maneuver by rolling to wings-level.

   4.15.1. Maneuver Description: Following the Four-Point Roll, reposition the aircraft and
   descend to fly wings-level down the 1,500-foot show line at 500 feet AGL and 400 knots.
   Approximately 3,000 feet past show center, begin a brisk but smooth wings-level pull to
   approximately 25-units AOA. Normal apex altitude is above 4,500 feet AGL. At apex
   altitude, reduce power. Airspeed should be 150-250 knots. The pull is held until the nose
   passes through 125-140 degrees of pitch where the backpressure is eased to maintain a
   constant nose track of 25-45 degrees nose-low inverted. The 25 to 45-degree nose-low
   inverted attitude is held until approximately 3,000 feet AGL and airspeed should be
   approximately 300 knots. At 3,000 feet AGL, advance throttles to MIL and perform an
   unloaded roll to wings-level upright. Roll the aircraft as necessary to maintain proper
   alignment along the show line (wind correction). Gradually increase back-stick pressure to
   ensure aircraft will not descend below 500 AGL. At no later than 1,200 feet AGL initiate
   full afterburner and begin a brisk but smooth wings-level pull to approximately 25-unit AOA.
   The second half is completed in the opposite direction using the procedures described earlier.
   4.15.2. Abnormal Procedures: If either or both afterburners fail to light abort maneuver by
   decreasing pitch attitude to level flight and investigate malfunction. If apex airspeed is less
   than 175 knots, decrease back-stick pressure and accelerate to target airspeed before reducing
   throttles and pulling nose through horizon. If desired pitch attitude is exceeded while
   inverted, roll upright and set desired pitch angle and continue maneuver. If less than 2,500
   feet AGL while inverted, an immediate roll and pull to wings-level will be initiated. If at any
   time it becomes apparent that the maneuver will be completed inside the show line (poor
   wind correction, improper alignment) abort the maneuver and set up for the next pass.

   4.16.1. Maneuver Description: After performing a reposition maneuver, align the aircraft
   to fly down the 1,500’ line. At 6,000’ from show center roll and pull to a 20-degree dive
   angle. The dive angle will normally be 10 – 25 degrees nose-low depending on winds. The
AFI11-246V1 23 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    81


   optimum dive angle is 20 degrees. Do not exceed 25 degrees. Recovery should be initiated
   at 1,000 - 800 feet AGL using a max performance pull in order to bottom out at or above 300
   feet AGL. Be careful not to over-G the aircraft during this pull. In order to make this corner,
   a minimum of 400 knots must be obtained. After recovering to level flight, accomplish a
   reposition maneuver to set up for the LAHD Bomb Pass. Use the 1,500-foot show line at
   show center as a reference point, and offset the pyro area at least 150 feet.
   4.16.2. Abnormal Procedures: If entry parameter limits are not met, abort the maneuver
   and perform a wings-level pass. If at any time the dive angle exceeds 25 degrees, either
   abort the pass and fly through straight and level or shift the aim point longer and parallel to
   the show line until the dive angle is 25 degrees or less. Check airspeed at 1,500 feet AGL. If
   it is not at least 375 knots, abort the pass and fly through straight and level.

   4.17.1. Maneuver Description: After performing the Low Angle Strafe Pass, continue
   straight and level to approximately 3,000 feet past show center, then begin a 40 to 50-degree
   turn away from the crowd starting a slight climb to apex around 1,000 feet AGL accelerating
   to approximately 450 knots. At approximately 2.5 miles from show center, make a flat turn
   and pull to a point to begin a run-in at 500 feet AGL and 20-30 degrees off the show line.
   Align the aircraft to fly slightly offset the preplanned bombing target/point, away from the
   crowd. Do not allow a vector towards the crowd! At approximately 1.3 miles from the
   target, pull up to 20-40 degrees nose-high. Passing approximately 1,500 feet AGL and
   approaching the run-in on the 500-foot show line, roll-in on the target. The dive angle will
   normally be 10 – 25 degrees nose-low depending on winds. The optimum dive angle is 20
   degrees. Do not exceed 25 degrees. Recovery should be initiated at 1,000 feet AGL using a
   max performance pull in order to bottom out at or above 400 feet AGL. Be careful not to
   over-G the aircraft during this pull. In order to make this corner, a minimum of 400 knots
   must be obtained. Use the 500-foot show line at show center as a reference point, and offset
   the pyro area at least 150 feet. After recovering to level flight, accomplish a reposition
   maneuver to set up for the SAM Weave.
   4.17.2. Abnormal Procedures: If entry parameter limits are not met, abort the maneuver
   and perform a wings-level pass. If at any time the dive angle exceeds 25 degrees, either
   abort the pass and fly through straight and level or shift the aim point longer and parallel to
   the show line until the dive angle is 25 degrees or less. Check airspeed at 1,500 feet AGL. If
   it is not at least 375 knots, abort the pass and fly through straight and level.

   4.18.1. Maneuver Description: After performing the LAHD Bomb Pass recovery to level
   flight, begin a right 30 to70-degree turn away from the crowd ensuring a slight climb away
   from the ground. The bank angle will be approximately 70-90 degrees ensuring you are at or
   above 500 feet AGL and beyond the 1,500’ show line at the end of the turn. Rapidly unload
   the jet and roll left 135 degrees and use a max performance pull into the oblique 10-20
   degrees nose-high. Then rapidly unload and roll the jet 180 degrees to the right and perform
   a maximum pull to 10-20 degrees nose-low into the oblique. Once reaching 10-20 degrees
   nose-low, rapidly unload, and roll upright to pull up into a normal reposition for the
   Dedication Pass.
   4.18.2. Abnormal Procedures: If entry parameter limits are not met, abort the maneuver
   and perform a normal reposition maneuver. If at any time the dive angle exceeds 25 degrees
   nose-low, immediately transition to a level pull to the reposition maneuver. At no time
   should airspeed drop below 300 knots or should the jet be lower than 400 feet AGL. If the
   airspeed drops below 300 knots in the climb, accelerate uphill prior to pull down.

   4.19.1. Maneuver Description: The maneuver is flown beyond the 500-foot line.
   Following the Sam Weave (high or low show), or Level 8 (flat show), attain a safe airspeed
   and reposition the aircraft to arrive behind and offset the crowd. The approach will be flown
   from behind the line, approximately 2 miles from show center, with an approximate 30
   degree dive angle and a 45 degree cut (bank angle 75 to 90 degrees) to the show line,
   remaining beyond 500 feet from the crowd at all times. Upon reaching a point 500 feet from
   the corner of the crowd and 300 feet AGL, roll the aircraft into a level arcing pass using a
   bank of 75 to 90 degrees. Use top rudder if necessary to maintain altitude. Select mil power
   until passing the show line or until a target airspeed of .85M is anticipated. Varying pressure
   altitudes and temperatures will determine when to deselect afterburner to ensure the target
   airspeed is attained at show center and the max airspeed is not exceeded. Ensure military
   power is selected prior to entering the arcing pass and through the exit of the maneuver. Do
   not use afterburner during the arcing pass. Optimum profile of the aircraft is achieved at
   approximately 80 degrees of bank. Use caution not to over-bank the aircraft and allow the
   aircraft to lose altitude while banking. In order to maintain 500 feet from the crowd at each
   corner, the flight path at show center will have to extend beyond 500 feet. Continue the arc
   beyond the opposite crowd corner, reduce power as required, roll out of bank, and continue a
   maximum 45-degree climb to set up for the Knife Edge Pass.
   4.19.2. Abnormal Procedures: Abort the maneuver if at any time the aircraft comes closer
   than 500’ to the crowd line or its lateral limits, an excessive dive angle or sink rate develops,
   entry parameters are not met, or the aircraft descends below 200 feet AGL. Abort the
   maneuver by rolling the aircraft wings-level and flying away from the crowd.

   4.20.1. Maneuver Description: Enter the 1,500’ show line at 500 feet AGL and 400 knots.
   At 8,000 to 6,000 feet prior to show center, raise the nose three to five degrees, establish a
   climb, and apply stick pressure to roll 90 degrees toward the crowd. The aircraft is held in
   this position until 8,000 to 6,000 feet past show center. Top rudder is applied to help hold
   the nose above the horizon so the full maneuver can be accomplished. Forward stick
   pressure is applied to keep the aircraft on the show line and to maintain level flight.
   4.20.2. Abnormal Procedures: If entry parameters are not met, abort the maneuver, make a
   flat pass, and reposition for the next maneuver. If the nose falls below level flight (zero
   degrees pitch in the HUD) or if the aircraft will descend below 400 feet AGL, abort the
   maneuver.

   4.21.1. Maneuver Description: Approach show center on the 1,500’ show line, wings-level
   at 500 knots and 300 feet AGL. At 3,500 feet prior to show center select full afterburner and
   initiate a 6 to 7.5-G wings-level pull to arrive at show center with 90 degrees of pitch. The
   pull should be made so the aircraft is vertical at show center. When the aircraft is vertical,
   perform high-rate unloaded aileron rolls until reaching a minimum of 250 knots or 3,000 feet
   below waivered airspace. Stop the aileron rolls and execute a vertical recovery by smoothly
   pulling the nose to the nearest horizon. Deselect afterburner and modulate power as
   necessary to set up for the spiral descent.
   4.21.2. Abnormal Procedures: If entry parameters are not met at 3,000 feet prior to show
   center, delay until entry parameters are met. If entry parameters are not met prior to 2,000
   feet past show center, abort the maneuver and reposition for the next pass. If it becomes
   apparent airspeed will decrease below 150 knots in the climb, initiate a vertical recovery.

   4.22.1. Maneuver Description: As the aircraft nose is brought through the horizon,
   reacquire the air show environment. In idle power, perform a vertical spiraling descent
   oriented toward show center. Initiate dive recovery to recover by 6,000 feet AGL. Do not
   exceed 450 knots in the descent. The direction of the dive recovery should be as necessary to
   reposition for the next maneuver, however do not exit the maneuver over the crowd.
   4.22.2. Abnormal Procedures: If entry airspeed window is not met (too fast) adjust dive
   angle to minimize airspeed in the descent. If below 12,000 AGL at the apex of the climb
   (airspace restrictions, weather conditions), adjust dive angle to safely execute a recovery at
   6,000 AGL. When initiating the spiral descent at altitudes above 15,000 AGL, adjust
   minimum dive recovery altitude accordingly. (If starting at 18,000’ AGL, initiate dive
   recovery at 9,000 AGL) Initiate an immediate dive recovery if airspeed is at/or above 450
   knots. Show center orientation is a secondary consideration in the spiral descent. If at any
   time during the maneuver it appears that the aircraft will not attain the prescribed
   altitude/airspeed parameters, the maneuver will be aborted. Roll out and/or pull to a wings-
   level position, initiate a descent and reposition the aircraft for follow-on maneuvering.
   Option: Due to changing weather conditions, the vertical spiraling descent may not be
   possible after the Max Climb. Start a descent when able to maintain VMC conditions to
   position the aircraft to set up for the next maneuver.

   4.23.1. Maneuver Description: On the 1,500’ show line at 3,000 feet prior to show center,
   500 feet AGL, and 350 knots select afterburner. Smoothly pull the nose five degrees up,
   establish a climb, and relax stick pressure. Perform an unloaded 405-degree aileron roll
   followed by an aggressive pull-up to downwind. During the pull to downwind, terminate
   afterburner and slow to below 300 knots. Configure for and execute a normal final turn and
   landing.
       4.23.1.1. Option 1: On the pull-up to downwind, an additional 180-degree roll
       (reversal) may be performed to land from the opposite direction. Start at 4,000 feet prior
       to show center.
       4.23.1.2. Option 2: If a Heritage Flight is to be performed immediately following
       completion of the demonstration, conduct a low approach or wings-level pass and
       proceed to rejoin with Heritage Flight aircraft using pre-briefed procedures.

   4.29.1. Maneuver Description: At approximately 2,500 feet past show center, select full
   afterburner and accelerate to approximately 450 knots. Turn away from the crowd using
   approximately 85 degrees of bank (<75 degrees inside the 1,500’ show line). Begin the turn
   with a smooth G onset-rate to maintain airspeed at approximately 350-400 knots and 5 to 7
   Gs. G-loading and airspeed bleed-off rate will vary with density altitude. Maintain a
   minimum of 300 knots. The first 180 degrees of turn should be accomplished with a 1¾-
   degree nose-up attitude to make the turn appear level to the crowd. After 225 degrees of
   turn, unload and briskly roll wings-level. Approaching the show line, reverse direction of
   turn and accomplish a second level turn in the opposite direction. Adjust power to enter the
   second turn with the same entry parameters as the first. Fly the second turn using the same
   techniques as the first. After 270 degrees and with a 45-degree cut to the show line, reverse
   the turn again. Vary the bank angle and pitch to arrive at level flight at the completion of the
   maneuver and to ensure the maneuver is finished above the entry altitude. Surface winds
   must be taken into careful consideration to center the maneuver over show center and to
   avoid overshooting the show line. Complete the maneuver by turning as required to finish on
   the show line heading the same direction as entry. Perform a repositioning maneuver to set
   up for the next maneuver.
   4.29.2. Abnormal Procedures: Adjust power and G as required to avoid overshooting the
   show line. If the aircraft descends below 500 feet AGL, reorient lift vector to ensure a timely
   correction. If the aircraft descends below 400 feet AGL or the airspeed decays below 300
   knots, abort the maneuver by rolling wings-level, climbing to 500 feet AGL, and
   repositioning for the follow-on maneuver.

                          F-16 DEMONSTRATION MANEUVERS

Section 5A—-General Information

5.1. General. Maneuvers described in this chapter will be used for training and for F-16 aerial
demonstrations. The demonstration sequence is designed so all of the maneuvers up to the are
performed in the same direction with respect to the crowd line. The is designed to be flown
against the wind. Abnormal procedures are written for each maneuver. If the entry conditions are
not met for any maneuver, a wings-level pass will be flown and the pilot will transition to the
next maneuver. Demonstration pilots will transmit parameters prior to initiating the descending
portion of vertical pull-throughs for the Split-S, Shark’s Tooth, and Vertical Reposition
maneuvers. These calls will be made when the pilot reaches apex of the maneuver. Ground
safety observer will monitor demonstration pilot altitude and airspeed radio calls and direct an
abort when parameter limits are exceeded. Following all maneuvers and before clearing the show
line to reposition for the next maneuver, the pilot will ensure any descent has been stopped and
the aircraft is in a climbing or level attitude with the flight path marker at or above the horizon.
5.2. Aircraft Configuration and Fuel Requirements. Aircraft configuration for all
demonstrations will be clean (no wing pylons or missiles except wingtip smoke winders) and
internal fuel. Fuel considerations include: divert requirements, cable availability, temperature,
and density altitude. Normal minimum fuel for take-off is:
   5.2.1. Staged Show: 6,000 pounds.
   5.2.2. High Show: 5,000 pounds.
   5.2.3. Low Show: 4,000 pounds.
5.3. Airspeed and G Limits. Demonstration pilots will not exceed 0.94 Mach. The maximum
target G for this demonstration profile is 7.5 Gs. This does not preclude a momentary increase in
G for safety considerations.
5.4. Show line Restrictions. The majority of the F-16 demonstration will be flown on the
1,500- foot show line. Maneuvers not conforming to FAA Order 8900.1, Volume 3, Chapter 6,
must be approved via the FAA AFS-800 Maneuver Package approval process.
5.5. Airspace and Runway Requirements. Required airspace for the F-16 is 15,000 feet AGL
and normally a five-mile radius from show center. The minimum dimensions of the aerobatic
box are 3,000 feet wide, 6,000 feet long, and up to 15,000 feet AGL (high show). If the FAA has
waived a show line to closer than 1,500 feet, the aerobatic box may be less than 3,000 feet wide,
provided there is at least 1,200 feet from either the primary or secondary show line. Minimum
runway length is 7,000 feet and width is 75 feet. The runway, taxiway, and parking area must be
stressed for a 30,000-pound aircraft with single wheel type landing gear.
5.6. Weather Requirements. Weather PARAMETER LIMITS for the high profile are a ceiling
of at least 7,000 feet and three miles ground and five miles in-flight visibility with a discernible
horizon. The Low Show profile requires 1,500' and 5 miles in-flight visibility with a discernable
horizon. The ceiling requirements for each maneuver are based on waived airspace (clear of
AFI11-246V1 23 OCTOBER 2014                                                                      99


clouds) and must be adjusted if using VFR rules. Maneuvers will be planned to maintain VMC
throughout the show sequence.
5.7. High Density Altitude Demonstrations. For high density altitude shows, adjust
PARAMETER LIMITS in accordance with the following:
   5.7.1. Add 500 feet to APEX altitudes for each 2,000 feet of altitude above 3,000 feet MSL
   and 10 knots to airspeeds. For example, if the show site altitude is 5,000 feet MSL, add 500
   feet to the baseline target and 10 knots to the airspeed. If the show site altitude is 7,000 feet
   MSL, add 1,000 feet to the baseline target and 20 knots to the airspeed.

Figure 5.1. F-16 Flat Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver.




   5.9.1. Flat Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver. The Flat Wifferdill Maneuver turn is a
   combination horizontal and shallow vertical turn used to change direction at each end of the
   show line when performing the low profile. The Flat Wifferdill Maneuver turn uses less
   altitude than a normal reposition. It requires a larger cut and tends to be looser and flatter
   than a normal turn. The target G for this maneuver is 6.5 to 7.0 Gs. A 270-degree turn
   reversal may be made while the aircraft is climbing. Each turn may differ slightly so that
   airspeed/altitude parameters for the next maneuver are established in the flat reposition. The
   entry "cut" turn for the flat reposition is made to ensure no show line or crowd line
   penetration.

Figure 5.2. F-16 Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver.




   5.9.2. Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver. This maneuver is a combination horizontal and
   vertical turn used to change direction at each end of the show line. The vertical plane is used
   to maintain proximity to the demonstration area. Each turn may differ slightly so that
   airspeed/ altitude parameters for the next maneuver are established in the turn. As the aircraft
   departs the show line, maneuver in the horizontal and vertical plane to reposition for the next
   maneuver. The Target G for this maneuver is 6.0 to 7.0 Gs. A 270-degree rolling turn
   reversal is made while still climbing. During the last half of the maneuver, while descending,
   the turn is adjusted to establish the proper show line entry. The entry "cut" turn for the
   reposition is made to ensure no show line or crowd line penetration.
      5.9.2.1. Abnormal Procedures: Weather, terrain, obstacles, and winds into the show
      line must be considered when determining how much vertical and horizontal turning
      room is required for the reposition.

        5.9.3.1. Maneuver Description: The vertical reposition will be flown to change
        direction at each end of the 1,500’ show line during a high show. Upon passing show
        center or at the completion of the previous maneuver, a straight-ahead climb is
        commenced using a 6.0 to 7.0 G pull to put the aircraft in a 55-degree nose high attitude.
        For slower entry parameters, use G as required to maintain a minimum of 150 KIAS.
        Power setting is based upon entry parameters to ensure a minimum airspeed of 150 KIAS
        in the climb. Pitch attitude may be reduced as well to hold airspeed. At a minimum of
        3,000 feet AGL, the aircraft is rolled inverted and the demonstration pilot unloads the
        aircraft to attain or exceed the apex target altitude. Once apex parameters are assured,
        initiate an aggressive 135-degree pull through the vertical, to approximately 45 degrees
        nose low. The peak altitude reached will be a minimum of 5,000 feet AGL with a target
        of 5,500 feet AGL. The throttle will be modulated as required to initiate the pull down
        with a target airspeed of 275 KIAS. Once recovery above the minimum altitude for the
        follow on maneuver is assured, backpressure is relaxed and the aircraft is smoothly flown
        to be in level flight at the entry altitude for the next maneuver. In no circumstances
        should the demonstration pilot play the G during the 135-degree pull through the vertical.
        5.9.3.2. Abnormal Procedures: If entry parameters are not attained, reposition in the
        oblique for follow-on maneuvers. If apex parameters are not achieved with regard to
        airspeed or altitude, immediately recover the aircraft to the nearest horizon and abort the
        split-S. If the airspeed exceeds 350 KIAS during any portion of the dive or is below 3,000
        feet AGL at 90 degrees nose-low, immediately initiate a dive recovery to the nearest
        horizon.

NOTE: May be flown either direction.
       5.9.4.1. Maneuver Description: The flat pass is a repositioning maneuver used alone or
       in combination with an oblique reposition for the primary purpose of orienting the
       subsequent demonstration maneuver in the approved direction relative to the crowd line.
       The may be flown in either direction at any time during the demonstration sequence if
       required. It should be flown IAW paragraph 5.11.

   5.10.1. Maneuver Description: Takeoff will not be attempted when the takeoff roll
   exceeds 80 percent of available runway. The takeoff is made in full afterburner. After
   takeoff, establish a positive rate of climb and raise the gear, at a minimum of 300 knots begin
   a wings-level 4.0 to 6.0-G pull. Hold the pull until 90 degrees of pitch, then release the
   backpressure to approximately 2.5 G until 25 to 35 degrees nose-high inverted. Play the
   backpressure to ensure the over-the-top airspeed and altitude are above 150 knots and 3,000
   feet AGL. Continue the pull until 25 to 45 degrees nose-low inverted. Unload to hold pitch,
   deselect afterburner, and perform an unloaded 1/2 roll to a wings-level upright. At 2,000 feet
   AGL, modulate power as required and begin a four to six-G wings-level pull to arrive on the
   show line at 500 feet AGL with 350 knots. Accomplish the second half of a Cuban 8 using
   entry airspeed of approximately 350 knots, an entry pull of 4.0 to 6.0 Gs and over-the-top
   minimum of 150 knots. The descending portion of the second half is accomplished exactly as
   the descending portion of the first half. NOTE: If airfield runway alignment or takeoff
   considerations drive a crowd right-to-left takeoff, the pilot may execute an immediate
   reposition to re-enter the appropriate show line from crowd left to accomplish the complete
   maneuver.
   5.10.2. Abnormal Procedures: If entry parameters are not attained, clear the show line in
   front of the crowd. If at any time during the maneuver it appears the minimum over-the-top
   altitude or airspeed parameters will not be met, the maneuver will be aborted by performing
   an unloaded roll to the wings-level upright position accelerating to 250 knots in afterburner
   and continuing down the show line. If desired pitch attitude is exceeded while inverted, roll
   upright and set desired pitch angle and continue maneuver. If less than 2,500 feet AGL while
   inverted, an immediate roll and pull to wings-level will be initiated. If at any time it becomes
   apparent that the maneuver will be completed inside the show line (poor wind correction,
   improper alignment) abort the maneuver and set up for the next pass.

   5.12.1. Maneuver Description: On the 1,500’ show line, at 3,500 feet prior to show center
   with approximately 425 knots raise the nose to 5-7 degrees pitch attitude, establish a climb,
   and relax stick pressure to approximately 0.8 Gs. Apply left-stick pressure to perform a
   maximum of three consecutive unloaded aileron rolls. Crosscheck the horizon and audibly
   count the rolls during the maneuver. As you complete the second roll, ensure the aircraft has
   gained altitude and that the flight path marker is above the horizon line in the HUD. If not,
   abort the maneuver and recover the aircraft above the minimum altitude. If you lose count of
   the number of rolls or experience roll-coupling immediately abort the maneuver. In all cases,
   the rolls will be completed at a higher altitude than entry. After rolling out wings-level upon
   completion of the third roll, smoothly apply aft-stick pressure as required to finish the
   maneuver at entry altitude (the objective of the maneuver is to make the pass look
   symmetrical to the crowd). Then perform a repositioning maneuver to prepare for the next
   maneuver.
   5.12.2. Abnormal Procedures: If the minimum entry parameters are not met transition to a
   wings-level flat pass. At wings-level following the second roll, abort the maneuver if the
   flight path marker is not above the horizon line. Abort the maneuver if you lose count of the
   rolls during the sequence.

   5.13.1. Maneuver Description: Beyond the 500’ show line and just prior to show center
   select full AB and accelerate to 400 knots. At show center, turn away from the crowd using
   75 to 85 degrees of bank (<75 degrees inside the 1,500’ show line). Begin the turn with a
   smooth G onset-rate to approximately 7.5 Gs. G-loading and airspeed bleed-off rate will vary
   with density altitude. Maintain a minimum of 250 knots. The first 180 degrees of turn should
   be accomplished with a 1¾-degree nose-up attitude and the last 180 degrees should be
   accomplished with a 1¾-degree nose-down attitude to make the turn appear level to the
   crowd. Vary the bank angle and pitch to arrive at level flight at the completion of 360
   degrees of turn and to ensure the maneuver is finished above the entry altitude. Surface winds
   must be taken into consideration in order to center this maneuver on show center and to avoid
   overshooting the show line. As you approach show center, smoothly but briskly roll out.
   Perform a repositioning maneuver to prepare for the next maneuver.
   5.13.2. Abnormal Procedures: If the minimum entry parameters are not met, the pilot will
   transition to a wings-level flat pass. If during any portion of the maneuver it becomes
   apparent the aircraft will descend below 400 feet AGL or airspeed decay below 250 knots,
   abort the maneuver by rolling wings-level and climbing to 500 feet AGL. If necessary, adjust
   power and G as required (no lower than 250 knots) to avoid overshooting the show line.

   5.14.1. Maneuver Description: On the 1,500’ show line, at 3,000 feet prior to show center,
   rotate the nose five to seven degrees nose-up, establish a climb, and relax stick pressure. A
   cadence four-point roll to the left is then performed by pausing momentarily at the 90-degree,
   180-degree, 270-degree, and 360-degree points. The pace of the cadence should ensure the
   aircraft is at the 180-degree point over show center. In all cases, the roll will be completed at
   a higher altitude than it starts. Move the stick briskly, initiating a left roll and an immediate
   stop at the proper 90-degree point when pressure is released. Upon returning to wings-level,
   smoothly apply aft-stick pressure as required to finish the maneuver at entry altitude (the
   objective of the maneuver is to make the pass look symmetrical to the crowd). At the
   completion of the pass, a repositioning maneuver is performed to set up for the next
   maneuver.
   5.14.2. Abnormal Procedures: If the minimum entry parameters are not met, the pilot will
   transition to a wings-level flat pass. If the flight path marker is below the horizon line at the
   wings-level inverted position, an immediate roll to the upright position will be made (abort),
   clearing the show line past the end of the crowd line.

   5.16.1. Maneuver Description: This maneuver may be initiated at the 500-foot show line.
   Enter the show line at 500 feet AGL and 400 knots. Just prior to show center select full
   afterburner and perform a 6.5 to 7.5-G slightly climbing turn (20 to 30 degrees pitch angle)
   left away from the crowd. After 90 degrees of turn, reverse the direction of the turn to the
   right by unloading and rolling under 180 degrees. Perform a 6.5 to 7.5-G right slightly
   descending turn (10 to 20 degrees nose-low) for 270 degrees rolling out heading the opposite
   direction with a minimum of 250 knots. Accelerate down the show line at 500 feet AGL in
   preparation for the next maneuver.
   5.16.2. Abnormal Procedures: If the minimum entry parameters are not met, the pilot will
   transition to a wings-level flat pass. If during any portion of the maneuver it becomes
   apparent the aircraft will descend below 400 feet AGL or overshoot 30 degrees nose-low, the
   maneuver will be aborted by rolling wings-level and climbing to 500 feet AGL. If it becomes
   apparent the aircraft will overshoot the show line, use airspeed and G as required (no lower
   than 250 knots) to prevent the overshoot.    NOTE: The Falcon Turn is a profile transition
   point if required by changing weather conditions.

   5.17.1. Maneuver Description: (High Show Only. If ceiling is less than 7,000' AGL
   transition to the high alpha pass following the Falcon Turn.) This maneuver is a three-sided
   square loop with the third corner at a 135-degree angle. It avoids the pure vertical recovery in
   the last corner of a normal square loop. On the 1,500’ show line, at 2,000 feet past show
   center, select afterburner and perform a 6.5 to 7.5-G pull to 90 degrees nose-high. Maintain
   full afterburner in the climb to 4,500 feet AGL, and then perform a 5.0 to 7.0-G pull of 90
   degrees to inverted. Roll out to wings-level upright and maintain 250 knots. At 2,000 feet
   past show center, roll inverted, select power as required and perform a 5.0 to 7.0-G pull to 90
   degrees nose-low. Approaching 4,500 feet to 3,500 feet AGL, at a maximum of 350 KIAS,
   continue to pull to 45 degrees nose-low upright. Hold until reaching 2,000 feet AGL, and
   then perform a descending turn away from the crowd. Turn left or right to set up on the
   appropriate 1,000 feet downwind for the High Alpha pass into the wind.
   5.17.2. Abnormal Procedures: If the minimum entry parameters are not met, the pilot will
   transition to a wings-level flat pass. Do not attempt to pull down from the inverted apex
   below 5,000 feet AGL or with more than 350 KIAS. If out of the maneuver envelope,
   perform a roll to wings-level upright and make a descending turn away from the crowd to set
   up on a downwind position for the High Alpha pass. At 90 degrees nose-low, max airspeed is
   350 KIAS and minimum altitude is 3,000 feet AGL. If either is exceeded, execute a dive
   recovery IAW tech order procedures.

   5.18.1. Maneuver Description: During the turn to the 500-foot show line following the
   shark’s tooth maneuver, use speed brakes and G as required to gradually slow the airspeed
   and attain 125 knots and 500’ AGL by 2,000 feet prior to show center. As the aircraft rolls
   out on the show line, ensure the speed brakes are retracted, smoothly bring the nose up and
   use power as required to achieve the target parameters. Use the Gun Cross in the HUD in
   relation to the pitch ladders to achieve the target AOA. As a technique, select VVI in the
   HUD to help achieve level flight, as the tendency is to climb during the maneuver. Maintain
   the desired ground track by looking out the sides of the canopy and cross checking the
   desired heading in the HUD and/or HSI. To complete the maneuver, select full afterburner
   and transition to the muscle climb.
   5.18.2. Abnormal Procedures: If the minimum entry parameters are not met transition to a
   wings-level flat pass. If the airspeed falls below 115 knots or a descent rate develops, select
   full afterburner and perform a normal go-around procedure.

   5.19.1. Maneuver Description: Passing show center, simultaneously select full afterburner
   and pull up to establish up to a 55-degree nose-high attitude using 1.5 – 1.8 Gs. For Low
   profile, vary nose position consistent with weather. The afterburner must light in order to
   execute this maneuver and allow the aircraft to accelerate to maintain a minimum of 150
   KIAS in the climb. Pitch attitude may be reduced to hold airspeed. The demonstration pilot
   may then transition to a Wifferdill or Vertical Reposition Maneuver (VRM) as required when
   adjusting to the show line for subsequent maneuvers. VRM will not be flown during the Low
   profile regardless of ceiling changes. If a VRM is flown, the demonstration pilot will adhere
   to the apex and 90-degree nose-low parameters listed in Table 5.10 and the procedures for a
   VRM as described in paragraph 5.9.3.1 Once recovery above the minimum altitude for the
   follow-on maneuver is assured, backpressure is relaxed and power modulated to smoothly
   transition to level flight at the entry altitude for the next maneuver.
   5.19.2. Abnormal Procedures: If the airspeed falls below the minimum of 150 knots, a
   nose-high recovery should be accomplished. If the airspeed exceeds 350 KIAS during any
   portion of a follow-on VRM or if the aircraft is below 3,000 feet AGL at 90 degrees nose-
   low, immediately initiate a dive recovery to the nearest horizon.

   5.20.1. Maneuver Description: Enter the 1,500’ show line at 500 feet AGL and 425 knots.
   At 4,000 feet prior to show center, raise the nose to five to seven degrees, establish a climb,
   and apply stick pressure to roll 90 degrees toward the crowd. Hold this attitude until 4,000
   feet past show center. Use top rudder to hold the nose above the horizon and forward stick
   pressure to keep the aircraft on the show line. To complete the maneuver, unload, roll wings-
   level, and perform a repositioning maneuver.
   5.20.2. Abnormal Procedures: If the minimum entry parameters are not met transition to a
   wings-level flat pass. If it becomes apparent the aircraft will descend below 400 feet AGL,
   roll out of the bank and clear the show line. NOTE: The Knife Edge Pass may be used as
   a repositioning maneuver for the purpose of orienting the subsequent demonstration
   maneuver in the approved direction relative to the crowd line.        NOTE: The Knife Edge
   Pass is a profile transition point if required by changing weather conditions.

   5.21.1. Maneuver Description: Enter on the 1,500’ show line with a minimum of 330
   knots at 300 feet AGL approaching show center 135 degrees to the crowd line, but with the
   flight path not directed toward the crowd. At 3,000 feet prior to show center select full
   afterburner and initiate a 6.5 to 7.5-G wings-level pull to arrive at show center with 90
   degrees of pitch. The pull should be made so the aircraft is vertical at show center. When the
   aircraft is vertical, perform high-rate unloaded aileron rolls until reaching a minimum of 250
   knots or 2,500 feet below wavered airspace. Every precaution must be taken to avoid slow
   airspeed in an exaggerated pitch attitude due to the potential of “pitch hang-up.” Stop the
   aileron rolls and execute a vertical recovery by smoothly pulling the nose to the nearest
   horizon to prevent exceeding waivered airspace. Modulate power and speed brakes as
   required while performing the descending portion of a repositioning maneuver to enter the
   show line for the next maneuver.
   5.21.2. Abnormal Procedures: If the minimum entry parameters are not met transition to a
   wings-level, flat pass. If roll-coupling occurs during the climb (to exceed approximately 2.5
   G), smoothly stop the roll, then pull to the nearest horizon, and roll upright. Initiate an
   immediate recovery to the nearest horizon if airspeed decays to 250 KIAS minimum or
   altitude reaches 2,500 feet below the top of waivered airspace.

   5.22.1. Maneuver Description: As the aircraft nose is brought through the horizon,
   reacquire the air show environment and perform the spiraling descent oriented toward show
   center. In idle power, allow the nose to fall to 45 degrees nose-low. Once established, apply
   back-stick pressure and roll simultaneously to maintain at least 200 knots initially in a
   spiraling dive, ensuring airspeed of 250-440 knots prior to initiating the recovery. At
   approximately 5,000’ AGL, adjust dive angle and roll in order to be wings-level, less than 45
   degrees nose-low at the planned altitude of 4,000’. The maneuver is complete when the dive
   angle is less than 45 degrees. Continue a descent as required to reposition for the next
   maneuver, however do not perform or exit the maneuver over the crowd. Do not exceed 440
   knots in the descent. The airspeed window of 250-440 knots at maneuver exit allows the
   pilot the flexibility to show the F-16’s maneuvering ability early in the maneuver while
   gaining energy at or below corner velocity to set up for the next maneuver—the Dedication
   Pass.
   5.22.2. Abnormal Procedures: If below 8,000’ AGL at the apex of the climb (airspace
   restrictions, weather conditions), adjust dive angle to safely execute a recovery at 4,000’
   AGL. Initiate an immediate dive recovery if airspeed exceeds 440 knots. Show center
   orientation is a secondary consideration in the spiral descent; do not continue the maneuver
   below minimum altitude to attempt a specific orientation in the air show environment. If at
   any time during the maneuver it appears that the aircraft will not attain the prescribed
   altitude/airspeed parameters, the maneuver will be aborted. Roll out and/or pull to a wings-
   level position, initiate a descent and reposition the aircraft for follow-on maneuvering.
   Option: Due to changing weather conditions, the vertical spiraling descent may not be
   possible after the Max Performance Climb. Start a descent when able to maintain VMC
   conditions to position the aircraft for the next maneuver.
5.23. Dedication Pass. The intent of this maneuver is to pay tribute to our war fighters. It is

AFI11-246V1 23 OCTOBER 2014                                                                     129


   attain a safe airspeed and reposition the aircraft to arrive behind and offset from the crowd.
   The approach will be flown from behind the line, approximately 2 miles from show center,
   with an approximate 30-degree dive angle and a 45-degree cut (bank angle 75 to 90 degrees)
   to the show line, remaining beyond 500 feet from the crowd at all times. Upon reaching a
   point 500 feet from the corner of the crowd and 300 feet AGL, roll the aircraft into a level
   arcing pass using bank angles of 75 to 90 degrees. Use top rudder if necessary to maintain
   altitude. Select max power until passing the show line or until a target airspeed of .85M is
   anticipated. Varying pressure altitudes and temperatures will determine when to select
   afterburner to ensure the target airspeed is attained at show center and the max airspeed is not
   exceeded. Optimum profile of the aircraft is achieved at approximately 80 degrees of bank.
   Use caution not to over bank the aircraft and allow the aircraft to lose altitude while banking.
   In order to maintain 500 feet from the crowd at each corner, the flight path at show center
   will have to extend beyond 500 feet. Continue the arc beyond the opposite crowd corner,
   reduce power as required, roll out of bank, and continue a maximum 45-degree climb to set
   up for the Tactical Pitch-up to Landing.
   5.23.2. Abnormal Procedures: Abort the maneuver if at any time the aircraft comes closer
   than 500’ to the crowd line or its lateral limits, an excessive dive angle or sink rate develops,
   entry parameters are not met, or the aircraft descends below 200 feet AGL. Abort the
   maneuver by rolling the aircraft wings-level and flying away from the crowd.

   5.24.1. Maneuver Description: Enter on the 1,500’ show line at 500 feet AGL and 350
   knots. At 2,000 feet prior to show center raise the nose to five to seven degrees pitch angle,
   unload, and perform a 405-degree aileron roll away from the crowd followed by a 5.0 to 7.5-
   G pull-up to point 90 degrees away from the crowd line. Execute a 180 degree roll, using
   afterburner and pull to the downwind leg. Configure for and execute a normal final turn and
   landing. Option: If a Heritage Flight is to be performed immediately following completion
   of the demonstration, conduct a low approach or wings-level pass and proceed to rejoin with
   Heritage Flight aircraft using pre-briefed procedures.
   5.24.2. Abnormal Procedures: If entry parameter limits are not achieved by show center,
   the 405-degree aileron roll will not be performed and a simple pull-up to a normal closed
   pattern will be flown.

   5.26.1. Maneuver Description: Takeoff will not be attempted when the takeoff roll
   exceeds 80 percent of available runway length. If airfield conditions permit, a brake release
   point should be selected so takeoff occurs at show center. The show-center takeoff point is a
   secondary consideration to determining critical field length, abort criteria, etc. In no case will
   the takeoff be initiated with less than 6,000 feet of runway remaining. The takeoff is made in
   full afterburner. Ensure a positive rate of climb is established after takeoff. Once the gear is
   retracted, a three to five-degree nose-high climb is made while accelerating to 400 knots. At
   this point, maintain afterburner and begin an energy sustaining pitch-up to 500 feet AGL,
   using 5.0 to 7.0 Gs, and turn away from the crowd. After 225 degrees of turn, unload and
   reverse the direction of turn and perform a second level turn in the opposite direction. After
   270 degrees with a 45-degree cut to the show line, the turn is again reversed. Vary the bank
   angle and pitch to arrive at level flight at the completion of the maneuver and to ensure the
   maneuver is finished above the entry altitude. Complete the maneuver by turning to finish on
   the show line heading in the same direction as takeoff. Surface winds must be taken into
   consideration in order to center this maneuver on show center and to avoid overshooting the
   show line. Once on the show line, execute a repositioning maneuver to prepare for either a
   (left to right takeoff) or the Triple Aileron Roll (right to left takeoff).
   5.26.2. Abnormal Procedures: If, during any portion of the maneuver it becomes apparent
   the aircraft will descend below 400 feet AGL or airspeed will decay below 250 knots, abort
   the maneuver by rolling wings-level, climbing to 500 feet AGL, and clearing the show line.
   Use power and G as required (no lower than 250 knots) to prevent the aircraft from
   overshooting the show line.
5.27. Flat Pass (Right to Left). If the direction of takeoff is left to right, the repositioning
maneuver following the Level or Cuban 8 will be used to prepare for a flat pass as described in
paragraph 5.11.1 At 2,000 feet past show center, execute a repositioning maneuver to set up for
the next maneuver.
5.28. Triple Aileron Roll (Left to right). The triple aileron roll will be performed as described
in paragraph 5.12.1 When wings-level following the last aileron roll, the pilot performs a
repositioning maneuver to set up for the next maneuver.
5.29. High-G Turn (Right to Left). The high-G turn will be performed as described in
paragraph 5.13.1 At 2,000 feet past show center, perform a repositioning maneuver to set up for
the next maneuver.
5.30. Four-Point Roll (Left to Right). The four-point roll is performed as described in
paragraph 5.14.1 At the completion of the pass, execute a repositioning maneuver to set up for
the next maneuver.
5.31. High Speed Pass. The High Speed Flat Pass will be performed as in paragraph 5.20.1 At
the completion of the pass, execute a reposition maneuver to set up for the next maneuver.

5.32. Falcon Turn (Left to Right). The Falcon Turn is performed as described in paragraph
5.16.1 At the completion of the maneuver, pull up to a downwind to prepare for the High Alpha
pass against the wind. If the wind favors a right to left final, a normal 180-degree pitch-up to
downwind is performed. NOTE: The Falcon Turn is a profile transition point if the weather
ceiling has changed.
5.33. High Alpha Pass (Into the wind). This maneuver may be flown on the 500-foot show
line. The High Alpha pass is performed as described in paragraph 5.18.1 At 3,000 feet past
show center, perform a repositioning maneuver to set up for the next maneuver.
5.34. Muscle Climb. The Muscle Climb will be performed as described in paragraph 5.19.1.
At the completion of the pass, execute a reposition maneuver to set up for the next maneuver.
5.35. Knife Edge Pass. The Knife Edge Pass will be performed as in paragraph 5.20.1 At the
completion of the pass, execute a reposition maneuver to set up for the next maneuver.
5.36. Dedication Pass. The Dedication pass will be performed as described in paragraph
5.23.1
5.37. Tactical Pitch-Up to Landing. The tactical pitch-up to landing is performed as described

                          F-22 DEMONSTRATION MANEUVERS

Section 6A—--General Information

6.1. General. Maneuvers described in this document will be used for training and flown in F-22
aerial demonstrations as the complete aerobatic demonstration profile. Aerobatic maneuvers are
included in this grouping, and as such this profile will be treated as a standard Single Ship
Tactical Demonstration profile. The profile passes are listed in a specific order and described in
a specific orientation to the crowd. Abnormal procedures are written for each maneuver. If the
entry conditions are not met for any maneuver, the pilot will recover to wings-level flight and
transition to the next maneuver. For certain maneuvers, the pilot is required to transmit airspeed
and/or altitude to a safety observer. The ground safety observer will confirm parameters are
good, monitor the demonstration pilot’s flight path, engine performance and visually clear the
demonstration area for traffic. The safety observer will direct an abort when parameter limits are
exceeded. Following each maneuver, and before clearing the show line to reposition for the next
maneuver, the pilot will ensure any descent has been stopped and the aircraft is in a level or
climbing attitude with the flight path marker at or above the horizon.
6.2. Aircraft Configuration and Fuel Requirements. These maneuvers will be flown in a
standard configured aircraft with a full fuel load of 18,000 pounds at engine start. If mission
needs dictate, taking off with less than full fuel is authorized. Under all circumstances, the pilot
must takeoff with enough fuel to execute the profile and divert if necessary. Inert weapons may
be loaded, however if the total weight exceeds 1,000 pounds the total fuel at takeoff must be less
than 17,000 pounds.
6.3. Airspeed and G Limits. Demonstration pilots will not exceed 0.94 Mach. The maximum
target G for this demonstration is 7.5 Gs. This does not preclude a momentary increase in G for
safety considerations.
6.4. Show line Restrictions. The majority of the F-22 demonstration will be flown on the
1,500-foot show line. Maneuvers not conforming to FAA Order 8900.1, Volume 3, Chapter 6,
must be approved via the FAA AFS-800 Maneuver Package approval process.
6.5. Airspace and Runway Requirements. Required airspace for the F-22 is 6,000 feet AGL
and normally a five-mile radius from show center horizontally. The minimum dimensions of the
aerobatic box are 3,000 feet wide, 4,500 feet long, and 7,000 feet AGL. If the FAA has waived a
show line to closer than 1,500 feet, the aerobatic box may be less than 3,000 feet wide, provided
there is at least 1,200 feet from either the primary or secondary show line. Minimum runway
length and width is 7,000 feet x 75 feet. The runway, taxiway, and parking area must be stressed
for a 65,000-pound aircraft with single wheel type landing gear.
6.6. Weather Requirements. Weather PARAMETER LIMITS for the high show profile are a
ceiling of at least 4,500 feet AGL, three miles ground and five miles in-flight visibility with a
discernible horizon. Ceiling required for the low profile is 1,500 feet. The ceiling requirements
for each maneuver are based on waived airspace (clear of clouds) and must be adjusted if using
VFR rules. Maneuvers will be planned to maintain VMC throughout the show sequence.
AFI11-246V1 23 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    137


6.7. High Density Altitude Demonstrations. For high density altitude shows, adjust
PARAMETER LIMITS in accordance with the following:
   6.7.1. Add 500 feet to APEX altitudes for each 2,000 feet of altitude above 3,000 feet MSL
   and 10 knots to entry airspeeds on all maneuvers that exceed 30 degrees AOA. For example,
   if the show site altitude is 5,000 feet MSL, add 500 feet to the baseline target and 10 knots to
   the airspeed. If the show site altitude is 7,000 feet MSL, add 1,000 feet to the baseline target
   and 20 knots to the airspeed.

time during the demonstration sequence as required. IAW FAA regulations, 90 degrees of bank
may be exceeded during repositions (if required). Repositioning turns may not include added
aileron rolls or other accenting maneuvers.

   6.9.1. Flat Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver. The Flat Wifferdill Maneuver turn is a
   combination horizontal and shallow vertical turn used to change direction at each end of the
   show line when performing the low profile. The Flat Wifferdill Maneuver turn uses less
   altitude than a normal Wifferdill. It requires a larger cut and tends to be looser and flatter
   than a normal Wifferdill. 270-degree turn reversal may be made while the aircraft is
   climbing. The target G for this maneuver is 6.5 to 7.0 Gs. Each turn may differ slightly so
   that airspeed/altitude parameters for the next maneuver are established in the flat Wifferdill.
   The entry "cut" turn for the flat Wifferdill is made to ensure no show line or crowd line
   penetration.

Figure 6.1. F-22 Flat Wifferdill Reposition.




   6.9.2. Wifferdill Reposition Maneuver. The Wifferdill turn is a combination horizontal
   and vertical turn used to change direction at each end of the show line. The vertical plane is
   used to maintain necessary proximity to the demonstration area. Each turn may differ
   slightly so that airspeed/altitude parameters for the next maneuver are established in the
   Wifferdill. As the aircraft departs the show line, maneuver in the horizontal and vertical
   plane to reposition for the next maneuver. The target G for this maneuver is 6.5 to 7.0 Gs. A
   270-degree turn reversal is made while still climbing. During the last half of the Wifferdill,
   while descending, the turn is adjusted to establish the proper show line entry. The entry "cut"
   turn for the Wifferdill is made to ensure no show line or crowd line penetration.
AFI11-246V1 23 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    139


Figure 6.2. F-22 Wifferdill Reposition.




   6.9.3. J-Turn Reposition Maneuver. The J-Turn reposition maneuver can be used to
   quickly change directions at each end of the show line while minimizing separation from the
   crowd and further displaying the slow-speed maneuverability of the Raptor. From desired
   position with 100 KCAS minimum, aggressively apply aft stick while wings-level to climb
   and slow the aircraft while increasing the alpha. At 36 degrees AOA or more, use stick and
   rudder to maneuver in the direction of the runway. Do not maintain high alpha more than is
   required to maneuver the aircraft and do not slow the aircraft to below 75 KCAS if below
   2,500 feet AGL and greater than 75 degrees nose-high. Once the nose slices back to the
   horizon and is pointed towards the crowd line, break the alpha to 36 degrees for the recovery
   and maintain alpha until sink rate is arrested and begin to set up for the next pass. Regardless
   of nose position, recover from high AOA and fly the aircraft out not later than 2,500 feet
   AGL.

   6.10.1. Maneuver Description: Select full AB at brake release and check engine conditions
   on the roll. Rotate at tech order speed and begin climb. Confirm gear is retracted and the
   light is extinguished in the gear handle. Accelerate in full AB with a positive climb rate until
   approaching show center and on the 1,500’ show line. At 250 KCAS begin an aggressive
   pull (soft to hard stop initially) up to 75 degrees nose-high. Hold 75 degrees nose-high
   (water mark) and allow airspeed to slow, AOA to decrease and altitude to increase. Passing
   3,000 feet AGL, smoothly bring the nose to 90 degrees nose-high and wait for 3,500 feet
   AGL. At 3,500 feet AGL, execute a full aft stick high AOA loop to bring the nose to 90
   degrees nose-low. Hold 90 degrees nose-low and accelerate. At 100 KCAS, execute a 405-
   degree roll to set the lift vector on a 45-degree reposition line. If 100 KCAS is not obtained
   prior to 2,800 feet AGL, do not execute the 405-degree roll, but rather a 45-degree roll to set
   the reposition line and begin recovery within parameters. Regardless of orientation, execute
   a 36-degree AOA recovery NLT 2,000 feet AGL and reposition for the next maneuver.
   6.10.2. Abnormal Procedures: If the show profile takeoff is interrupted by an aircraft
   malfunction, make a normal takeoff or if conditions warrant, abort the takeoff. If an
   afterburner does not light or they are producing thrust asymmetrically do not initiate the pull
   up. If an afterburner blows out prior to initiating the pull, immediately abort the maneuver
   and execute a nose-high recovery. Should an engine or afterburner fail, immediately reduce
   both throttles to MIL or below and recover the aircraft. Do not reselect AB until any yaw
   rate is arrested and airspeed is >100 KCAS. If the aircraft slows to 75 KCAS prior to
   reaching 2,500 feet AGL, do not execute the high AOA loop and execute a nose-high
   recovery to wings-level. Should the takeoff need to be executed from right to left for winds
   or runway length, execute a 225-degree roll to set the reposition line. Regardless of the
   starting axis, the reposition line needs to be set and the recovery initiated by 2,000 feet AGL.

   6.11.1. Maneuver Description: Prior to show center, select full AB and accelerate to 440
   KCAS. Beyond the 500' show line and at show center, turn away from the crowd using 75 to
   85 degrees of bank. Begin the turn with an aggressive G onset-rate to 7.5 Gs to avoid
   accelerating and begin bleeding airspeed. G-loading and airspeed bleed-off rate will vary
   with density altitude. The first 180 degrees of turn should be accomplished with a 1 ¾
   degree nose-up attitude and the last 180 degrees of turn should be accomplished with a 1 ¾
   degree nose-down attitude to make the turn appear level to the crowd. After the first 180
   degrees of turn, continue to bleed airspeed down to 250 KCAS. Vary the bank angle, pitch,
   and pull to arrive at level flight, 275 KCAS, and no closer than 1,500 foot show line at the
   completion of 360 degrees of turn. Maximum degrees of flight path marker negative pitch
   allowed while correcting for altitude is 5 degrees. Surface winds must be taken into
   consideration in order to center this maneuver on show center and to avoid overshooting the
   show line. As you approach show center, smoothly roll out and aggressively pull the nose to
   90 degrees nose-high. 90 degrees nose-high may be exceeded (up to 110 degrees) as long as
   the airspeed minimum is maintained. As soon as the aircraft reaches 150 KCAS, begin a full
   forward push to drive the nose back down to the horizon and set up for the J-Turn reposition.
   6.11.2. Abnormal Procedures: If the minimum entry parameters are not met, the pilot will
   transition to a wings-level flat pass. If during any portion of the maneuver it becomes
   apparent the aircraft will descend below 400 feet AGL or airspeed decay below 200 KCAS,
   abort the maneuver by rolling wings-level and climbing to 500 feet AGL. If the aircraft
   approaches 475 KCAS and the pilot is already at 9 Gs, reduce power to not less than
   minimum afterburner and bleed energy. If necessary, adjust power and G as required (no
   lower than 200 KCAS) to avoid overshooting the 1,500’ show line. In the pull after the roll-
   out, if airspeed reaches 150 KCAS prior to achieving 90 degrees nose-high begin the push
   forward early. Do not attempt the J-turn reposition if the aircraft will not exceed 2,500 feet
   AGL during the turn.

   and altitude. Passing show center, close all doors, add power, and fly to the 1,500’ show
   line. Begin a climb to 500 feet AGL and select MAX AB. Once above 500 feet AGL and
   250 KCAS, execute a 300-degree roll to set your lift vector (LV) on the reposition line for
   the Dedication Pass.
   6.12.2. Abnormal Procedures: Doors will only be opened IAW tech order guidance. If
   doors do not open symmetrically, close all doors and abort the pass.

   6.13.1. Maneuver Description: The maneuver is flown beyond the 500-foot show line.
   The approach will be flown from behind the line, approximately 2 miles from show center
   with an approximate dive angle of 30 degrees and a maximum of 45-degree cut from the
   show line (as to not exceed 90 degrees of bank in the turn). Maintain beyond 500 feet
   horizontally from the crowd at all times. Upon reaching a point 500 feet from the corner of
   the crowd at 300’ AGL, roll the aircraft into a level arcing pass using 75 to 90 degrees of
   bank. Select full AB until passing the show line or until .92M is anticipated. In order to
   maintain 500 feet separation from the crowd at both corners, the apex of the arc will be
   greater than 500’ from show center (the amount depends on the degrees offset from the show
   line at the start of the arc and the amount of G used in the turn). Continue the arc until
   reaching the opposite crowd corner, roll out, reduce power and initiate a climb.
   6.13.2. Abnormal Procedures: Abort the maneuver if at any time: the aircraft comes closer
   than 500’ to the crowd line or its lateral limits, an excessive dive angle or sink rate develops,
   entry parameters are not met, or the aircraft descends below 200 feet AGL. Abort procedures
   are to roll wings-level, climb and fly away from the crowd.

   6.14.1. Maneuver Description: Following the Dedication Pass reposition, align on the
   1,500-foot crowd line at 300 feet AGL and 300 KCAS. Approaching show center, select full
   AB, ensure both are lit symmetrically and begin an aggressive (soft to hard stop) pull to 90
   degrees nose-high. When established 90 degrees nose-high with AOA less than 10 degrees,
   execute a 360-degree roll. Climb and decelerate to arrive at 4,000 feet AGL with no less
   than 75 KCAS. Execute a maximum (hard stop) wings-level pull to pull the nose through the
   inverted around to the horizon (high alpha loop). As the nose approaches the horizon
   upright, apply full pedal in the best direction for winds and maintain full-aft stick. Continue
   the turn for 360 degrees or until lined up on the 1,500-foot crowd line and begin an
   aggressive push forward to break the alpha and accelerate. Catch 36 alpha in full AB and
   arrest the descent rate. Should winds, weather or other factors dictate, the pedal turn may be
   executed as two 180-degree turns. This sequence of two 180-degree turns must be pre-
   briefed and should not be executed from an airborne “on the fly” assessment. If the 180/180
   pedal turn is the desired maneuver, add 1,000 feet to the apex pull, making the minimum pull
   5,000 feet AGL. Two 360-degree rolls will be executed due to the additional altitude
   required.
   6.14.2. Abnormal Procedures: If an afterburner does not light, do not initiate the entry pull
   up. If an afterburner blows out prior to initiating the apex pull, immediately abort the
   maneuver and execute a nose-high recovery. If the aircraft airspeed decreases to less than75
   KCAS prior to reaching 4,000 feet AGL, initiate the pull early and assess altitude parameters
   to execute the pedal turn. If 2,500 feet AGL will be reached prior to completing the pedal
   turn, recover early. No matter the orientation of the aircraft, recovery will be initiated at
   2,500 feet AGL and a 36-degree AOA recovery will be flown to arrest sink rate. Should an
   engine or afterburner fail, immediately reduce both throttles to MIL or below and recover the
   aircraft. Do not reselect AB until yaw rate is arrested and airspeed is greater than 100 KCAS.

   the aircraft into the vertical. Continue a maximum pull all the way around until the nose of
   the aircraft is upright and at the starting horizon. Command forward-stick to decrease alpha
   and accelerate. Catch 36 degrees alpha and maintain until sink rate is arrested.
   6.15.2. Abnormal Procedures: If afterburners are not symmetrically lit, do not initiate the
   pull up. Smoothly pull to the nearest horizon and recover the aircraft. Should an engine fail
   or an afterburner blow out, ensure throttles are in MIL or below and recover the aircraft. Do
   not reselect AB until any yaw rate is arrested and airspeed is >100 KCAS.

   6.16.1. Maneuver Description: Following recovery from the Power Loop, on the 1,500’
   show line, at 1,400 feet AGL (higher if aircraft is recovered earlier) and 36 degrees AOA,
   apply full lateral stick and approximately half pedal deflection with the flight path marker
   above the horizon. Maintain 30-36 degrees AOA initially, then remove pedal deflection and
   reduce back-stick pressure to maintain 20-28 degrees AOA while the LV is below the
   horizon. Once the LV is above the horizon, complete the roll by increasing back-stick
   pressure and AOA to 30-36 degrees. When the aircraft reaches upright wings-level to the
   horizon, decrease angle of attack, accelerate and begin to reposition for the next maneuver.
   6.16.2. Abnormal Procedures: If both afterburners do not light, do not exceed 30 degrees
   angle of attack and recover the aircraft. If the aircraft descends below 1,200 feet AGL,
   immediately initiate a recovery by rolling wings-level (with decreased AOA) and pulling to
   the nearest horizon. If the aircraft ever exceeds 40 degrees nose-low or an excessive sink
   rate develops, recover. If airspeed is allowed to decay to less than 100 KCAS, terminate the
   maneuver and recover.

   6.17.1. Maneuver Description: After the Loaded Roll, reposition behind the crowd,
   perpendicular to the show line and directly behind show center. Fly over show center at
   1,000 feet AGL and 250 KCAS. Select MIL power over show center and at the 1,500-foot
   show line, execute a hard stop pull in MIL power to 80 degrees nose-high. Hold 80 degrees
   nose-high with back stick pressure and attempt to align the waterline and CDM as the aircraft
   slows. Modulate power to arrive at 3,000 feet AGL and 0 KCAS. Smoothly reselect MIL
   power and allow the aircraft to slide backwards while holding 80 degrees nose-high. At
   2,700 feet AGL or 75 KCAS backwards (whichever occurs first), push forward of the soft
   stop to assist the FLCS in bringing the nose down and reducing AOA. Recover in MIL
   power to wings-level flight. Begin a turning reposition for the Slow Speed Pass. Entry to
   the tail slide may be flown from show left or right if dictated by crowd or show line
   restrictions (e.g. foreign tradeshows). This type of entry will be flown with same entry
   altitude and airspeed parameters; however, the entry will be initiated by a climbing turn away
   from the crowd approximately 1,000’ prior to show center to achieve the same tail slide
   parameters and position in the aerobatic box as the standard reposition over the crowd. This
   entry must be flown and documented in practice prior to accomplishing in a public
   performance.
   6.17.2. Abnormal Procedures: If sideslip (beta in the HUD) rapidly increases through 20
   degrees or is observed greater than 30 degrees, initiate a recovery by pushing forward
   slightly less than the soft stop. If the tail slide begins prior to 2,800 feet AGL, immediately
   initiate a recovery.

   point ~3,000’ from the start of the crowd line. Target the line 90 degrees off pass heading at
   1,000 feet AGL and 150 KCAS in MIL power. Execute a soft stop pull to align the jet on the
   desired heading and catch 36 degrees angle of attack. Do not exceed 40 degrees angle of
   attack. Manipulate power and pitch to maintain 1,000 feet AGL and 36 degrees angle of
   attack on show line heading. After passing the crowd on the opposite side, select full
   afterburner and climb to 4,000 feet AGL to set up for the Split-S. During a Low Show, the
   reposition may be flown no less than 500 feet AGL. In all cases, the aircraft will not be
   flown less than 120 KCAS greater than 30 degrees AOA when less than 900 feet AGL.
   6.18.2. Abnormal Procedures: If 40 degrees angle of attack is exceeded, immediately add
   power and push forward to catch and sustain 36 degrees. If the aircraft descends below 900
   feet AGL terminate the maneuver and recover the aircraft. Do NOT select afterburner with
   less than 75 KCAS and greater than 36 degrees AOA. If the aircraft slows below 75 KCAS,
   add power (up to MIL) and decrease angle of attack. If an engine fails, IMMEDIATELY
   reduce power to mid-range on both throttles and begin a soft stop push to reduce AOA and
   gain airspeed. Do not push the nose greater than 10 degrees nose-low. Use lateral stick and
   pedal as required to maintain wings-level controllable flight. Accelerating through 100
   KCAS, smoothly bring both throttles to MIL and full afterburner passing 125 KCAS.
   Recovery may be limited to 20 degrees AOA.

   6.19.1. Maneuver Description: In the climb after the Slow Speed pass move to the 1,500’
   show line, maintain 45-50 degrees nose-high and allow the aircraft to accelerate. Tailor
   degrees nose-high to not only accelerate but also gain separation away from the crowd for the
   follow-on High Speed Pass. If the nose is held too nose-high there may not be enough room
   to accelerate after the maneuver. At 4,000 feet AGL roll inverted and crosscheck airspeed.
   With 150 KCAS (minimum) execute an energy gaining turn to proceed back towards show
   center. Do not exceed 350 KCAS until the nose is through 90 degrees nose-low. Orientation
   to the crowd line needs to be immediately assessed. If the aircraft is not on the extended
   show line immediate corrections must be made. Position the aircraft on the non-aerobatic
   show line at 300 feet AGL and approximately .8M for the high speed pass.
   6.19.2. Abnormal Procedures: A parameters call to the safety observer is required prior to
   starting the pull. If airspeed is less than 150 KCAS (minimum) push the nose toward the
   horizon and increase airspeed to greater than 150 KCAS (minimum). With altitude greater
   than 3,500 feet and airspeed greater than 150 KCAS, execute Split-S. If altitude is less than
   3,500 feet AGL (i.e. weather) or airspeed is above 275 KCAS, abort the Split-S reposition.
   Roll the aircraft away from the crowd, reposition in a horizontal plane and slice back for the
   next maneuver. If an aircraft malfunction that will affect the aerodynamic performance of
   the aircraft asserts prior to reaching 90 degrees nose-low, discontinue the pull, roll wings-
   level and recover the aircraft.

   6.21.1. Maneuver Description: Establish the jet on the 1,500 foot crowd line from either
   right to left or left to right. Prior to entering the aerobatic box, achieve 300-400 feet AGL
   and 300 KCAS. Approximately 3,000 feet prior to show center bring the nose of the aircraft
   up (5 degrees nose-high or less should be required) to obtain 500 feet AGL by 1,000 feet
   prior to show center. 1,000 feet prior to show center, select full afterburner and roll the
   aircraft to 90 degrees of bank with the canopy to the crowd. At show center, execute a 190-
   degree roll into the crowd (tuck under) to establish 80 degrees of bank away from the crowd.
   Aggressively pull for the pitch to land or to reform for the Heritage Flight.
   6.21.2. Abnormal Procedures: If airspeed is less than 250 KCAS, do not roll and simply
   pitch to land. If altitude is less than 400 feet AGL, do not execute the roll and pitch to land.
