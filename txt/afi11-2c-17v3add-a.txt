                                             Chapter 1

                                             POLICY

1.1. General. This instruction establishes basic cargo compartment configurations, standard
equipment, and location of such equipment aboard the C-17A aircraft. Personnel using this
instruction should be aware of the infinite number of available variations. The cargo
compartment limitations listed here are the most typical for day-to-day operations. For
operational planning purposes, each configuration is annotated with minimum time and number
of personnel to configure the aircraft. The times quoted are approximate and are configuration
times only; times do not include time needed to de-configure. For example, to de-configure from
a P-1 configuration (full side seats and center seats) and configure for C-2 (clean floor) requires
significantly more than 20 minutes, which is the time allocated to configure a C-2 configuration.
All C-17A aircraft are normally configured with standard quantities of life support equipment in
accordance with this instruction. TO 1C-17A-5-2, Loading Data, USAF Series, C-17A Aircraft,
Job guide TO 1C-17A-2-10JG-70-1, Ground Handling Mission Reconfiguration – Cargo
Compartment, and this instruction will be used by maintenance personnel to configure the
aircraft.
1.2. Responsibilities. Mobility units performing services on the C-17 aircraft, e.g. aircraft
maintenance unit, terminal services, support equipment branch, and Aircrew Flight Equipment
are responsible for configurations and inventory of the aircraft with the equipment listed in this
instruction, TO 1C-17A-5-2, Job guide TO 1C-17A-2-10JG-70-1, or as outlined in the mission
directives. (T-2) This includes the installation/removal/stowage of the equipment IAW the
configurations and equipment tables outlined here. Personnel engaged in planning operations
must consider the most appropriate configurations to satisfy mission requirements and minimize
variations.
1.3. Standard Cargo Compartment Configuration Codes. Use the standard configuration
letter codes in Table 1.1 when referring to C-17A cargo compartment configurations. Follow
the letter code by the number which identifies the configuration capability tables outlined here.
Indicate each configuration code in the mission directive.

Table 1.1. Standard Cargo Compartment Configuration Letter Codes.
     Letter Code     Definition
     AE              Aeromedical Evacuation
     AEC             Aeromedical Evacuation and Cargo
     C               Cargo
     CP              Cargo and Passengers
     P               Passengers
     SP              Seat Pallet (Cargo and Passengers)
     ADP             Airdrop Personnel
     ADC             Airdrop Cargo
     CDS             Container Delivery System
     DV              Distinguished Visitor (VIP Support Flights)
     SD              Static Display
     SLC             Senior Leader In-transit Conference Capsule
1.4. Deviations.    The configurations established by this instruction may require deviations for a
specific mission.   Each deviation will be carefully evaluated prior to mission operation to ensure
AFI11-2C-17V3ADD-A 10 july 2014                                                                  5


flight safety and compatibility with aircraft equipment. Each mission directive will identify the
cargo compartment configuration by code and the deviation, if necessary, to satisfy the mission
requirement. For example, an aeromedical evacuation mission may require more litters than
available in configuration AE-1. Consult the appropriate configuration charts to determine at
what location the desired additional litters can be installed. Indicate in the mission directive by
position, the litter tier provisions to be installed, i.e., configuration AE-1, install litter tier
provisions J and L. In any case of deviation, consideration must be given to corresponding
changes in required equipment, including weight and balance revisions. Aircraft supporting JCS
OPORD-007 will be configured In Accordance With (IAW) OPORD-007. Any deviations to
OPORD-007 aircraft will be coordinated through HQ AMC/XOOS.
1.5. Weight and Balance. Configurations, equipment, and necessary supply changes to conduct
airlift missions affect the weight and balance of the aircraft. To standardize equipment and the
location of the equipment, include items shown in Table 2.1 in the basic weight of the aircraft.
Add equipment listed in Table 2.2 as necessary, and enter in references 5, 6, or 7 of DD Form
365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F. For simplicity, the loadmaster will enter the
weight and moment data contained in the required equipment table for the applicable
configuration. Adjustments will be made when the actual on board weight of these items (due to
deviations) vary from the data shown. When aircraft equipment is moved from its stowage
location, aircraft moment changes are not required on the DD Form 365-4. Electronic computer
data sheets may be used in lieu of the DD Form 365-4 provided these sheets contain essentially
the same data listed on DD Form 365-4.
1.6. Distribution. The following agencies should have direct access to this AFI: Staff
Operations, Aircrew Stan/Eval, Command Posts/Operations centers, Air Terminal Operations
Centers, Squadron/Port Operations officers, Air Freight Management, Fleet Service, Aircraft
Maintenance units, alternate mission equipment sections, Quality Assurance, and Aircrew Flight
Equipment sections. One paper copy will be maintained in each supplemental weight and
balance handbook aboard each aircraft. (T-2)

                                           Chapter 3

  STANDARD EQUIPMENT WEIGHT AND BALANCE DATA AND FLOOR PLANS

3.1. Scope. This chapter contains basic cargo compartment configurations in tabular and floor
plan format, including weight, location, and moment data for associated standard equipment.
3.2. General. Although deviations to the basic configurations are authorized to meet special
requirements, consider the following factors when planning such changes:
   3.2.1. Drawings in this chapter are not to scale with respect to aircraft and equipment
   location.
   3.2.2. When the ATGL is installed for use, the centroid will be positioned at FS 391in the
   Aerial Delivery System (ADS) rail system. ATGLs may be transported as cargo (not for use)
   in either rail system. ATGLs loaded on the aircraft ramp will be drained of all fluids.
   3.2.3. When an ATGL is onboard, eight palletized seat assemblies may be installed. In this
   configuration, the pallet immediately aft of the ATGL shall have the first row of seats
   removed from the pallet assembly. When an ATGL is not onboard, nine sets of palletized
   seats may be installed.
   3.2.4. Equipment for ATGLs will be determined by local base operating policy. Each
   lavatory should contain at a minimum of one roll of toilet paper, 1 pack of paper towels, and
   soap.
   3.2.5. When carrying more than 40 passengers in any configuration, maximum seating
   capacity must be reduced by one to accommodate the additional crewmember required to be
   in the cargo compartment for takeoff and landing. This restriction does not apply to
   personnel airdrop missions with no planned airland mission legs.
   3.2.6. When the payload consists of palletized netted cargo or cargo that is secured with
   straps, a 30-inch space will be maintained between the cargo and the nearest forward
   occupied seat, litter, or nuclear cargo. (T-2) When the cargo (palletized or non-palletized)
   is secured with chains, or when a plywood barrier and chain bridle(s) are installed to attain
   all forward restraint on netted cargo, the 30-inch spacing is not required. Exception: For
   patient access, the 30-inch spacing is always required when carrying litter patients regardless
   of type of tiedown used. Sidewall seats directly adjacent to pallets loaded in the Logistics
   Rail System will not be occupied during takeoff or landing regardless of pallet construction.
   (T-2)
   3.2.7. Palletized seats are not intended for prolonged flights, and require additional
   emergency oxygen sources and life preservers (overwater flights) to be added. Palletized
   seats will only be occupied when loaded facing forward in the aircraft. (T-2) When loaded
   as cargo (not occupied), palletized seats may be loaded in any orientation in either rail
   system.
   3.2.8. EPOS is the primary emergency oxygen source for palletized seats. When used for
   that purpose, do not exceed FL 410. (T-2) Oxygen provisions must be sufficient to
   accomplish the planned flight from the equal time point to a suitable recovery base. (T-2)
 10                                                       AFI11-2C-17V3ADD-A 10 july 2014


   Calculate EPOS oxygen supply at 60 minutes for seated passengers. Extended flights may
   require more than one EPOS per passenger.
3.3. Standard Equipment. Equipment in Table 3.1 will be used to complete the DD Form
365-4. Items will be place on the aircraft as required to meet mission requirements. Items added
to or subtracted from the basic configurations will be adjusted on the DD Form 365-4. Planning
agencies will ensure specific items needed, above quantities in the basic configuration, are
annotated on the mission directive. For example, three 5-gallon water containers are provided
for a P-1 configuration. If two additional 5-gallon water containers are required; annotate the
mission description as; “P-1Mod: add two 5-gallon water containers.”
3.4. Legend of Configurations. See Figures 3.1 – Figure 3.19 for details of each
configuration.

NOTES:
1. Numbers based on 15-Passenger Seat Pallets and utilization of 54 sidewall seats. One seat has been
allocated for the additional crewmember required in the cargo compartment when more than 40
passengers are carried.
2. When the payload consists of palletized netted cargo or when the cargo is secured with straps, a 30-
inch space will be maintained between the cargo and nearest occupied row of seats. When a plywood
barrier and chain bridle(s) are installed to attain all forward restraint on the netted cargo (install IAW TO
1C-17A-9) or when the cargo is secured with chains, the 30-inch spacing is not required. When these
requirements cannot be achieved, subtract five-seats from number available.
3. Numbers based on utilization of ADS pallet positions on the cargo floor, and Logistic pallet positions
on the cargo ramp. Ramp will not be available for ground evacuation when pallets are placed side-by-side
in Logistics pallet positions 8 and 9.

NOTES:
This table is for planning purposes only and reflects the maximum seats available for a specific number of pallets or the maximum
number of pallets for a specific number of seats.
 1. When the payload consists of palletized netted cargo or when the cargo is secured with straps, a 30-inch space will be
maintained between the cargo and nearest occupied seat. When a plywood barrier and chain bridle(s) are installed to attain all
forward restraint on the netted cargo or when the cargo is secured with chains, the 30-inch spacing is not required. When these
requirements cannot be achieved on the forward most pallet in the ADS rails, subtract two seats from the number available.
2. Sidewall seats directly adjacent to pallets loaded in the Logistics Rail System will not be occupied during takeoff or landing
regardless of pallet construction.
3. All centerline seats start at station 404.
4. ADS rail sections aft of station 669 will be lowered. Portion of the pallet in ADS 4 will be out of rails, additional restraint will
be required for lateral left/right and vertical. Additional forward/aft restraint may be required based on pallet weight.

NOTES:
1. Maximum of 40 A-22 containers (32 containers on the cargo floor and 8 containers on the cargo ramp). ECVR will be
installed for containers aft of FS 1100.
2. Position BSA at FS 365. Adjust aft as necessary to accommodate fewer containers.
3. ADS rails, center logistic rails and roller conveyors between these rails raised. Outboard logistic rails and other roller
conveyors stowed. Omni rollers are not permitted for airdrop use.
4. 54 troop seats available. Crew complement and mission profile governs number of seats offered. Large crew complements
may further reduce the number of seats offered.
5. Inboard ramp toes will be installed in the low position with rollers and guide rails installed. Outboard toes may be stowed on
cargo door. Stow ramp toes (4) for flight.
6. Install anchor cable support and anchor cables IAW TO 1C-17A-1-4, and Job Guides.

                                     REFERENCE DATA

4.1. Scope. This chapter contains reference data to assist personnel in load planning.
4.2. Airdrop. Several factors must be considered during planning of cargo airdrop operations.
   4.2.1. No overhang of load permitted on platform unless specified in the rigging TO/FM.
   4.2.2. Weight and balance will be considered at all times. When multiple passes of airdrop
   loads are planned, calculations will be made, prior to takeoff, to determine the aircraft CG
   after each load has exited. This is accomplished to assure CG flight limits are not exceeded.
   This calculation is required only for those loads remaining on the aircraft following each
   pass. For sequential airdrop, calculations will be made to assure CG limits are not exceeded
   in the event of a malfunction resulting in platforms remaining on the aircraft.
4.3. Personnel limitations. The Personnel Limitations Chart (Table 4.3) reflects the number of
personnel (crews and passengers/troops) that the crew lavatory and aircraft urinals can
accommodate. Table 4.3 will be considered when determining number of passengers/troops that
can be airlifted without an ATGL.
4.4. Miscellaneous Data. The following tables and figures are provided to aid in configuration
planning, weight and balance:
   4.4.1. Table 4 1 Standard Weights.
   4.4.2. Table 4 2 Crew Weights.

2. Crew members must be subtracted from the figures given to arrive at maximum troop load.
3. Do not consider children up to 7-years old when computing maximum load figures.
4. If the toilet leaks, maintenance facilities will be notified to repair the toilet before
passengers are airlifted. If maintenance is not available or toilet leak cannot be repaired,
passengers will not be airlifted. Exception: At the discretion of the aircraft commander,
passengers may be carried on flights of one hour or less provided the lavatory can be repaired
at the next station.

       AIRCREW FLIGHT EQUIPMENT CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS

5.1. Aircraft-Installed AFE Procedures. Handle AFE with care to avoid damage.
Prepositioning equipment in accordance with this publication allows flexibility while the aircraft
is away from home-station and standardizes AFE configurations Air Force-wide. For AETC
flying units where AMC is the lead command, units are authorized to load aircraft with only the
mission required AFE. AETC Operations Group Commanders (or equivalent) will ensure an
Operational Risk Management assessment (ORM) is accomplished regarding utilization of AFE
to safely support mission requirements. (T-3) In the event installed AFE inspection comes due
while aircraft is on alert status of away from home station, follow guidance provided in TO 00-
20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures.
5.2. Aircraft Configuration. Configure aircraft IAW TO 1C-17A-1, Flight Manual, USAF
Series, C-17A Aircraft and TO 1C-17A-5-2. AFE equipment that is not being utilized will be
stored in the survival equipment locker or in its designated storage location as depicted in TO
1C-17A-5-2. Crewmembers will return all AFE to the designated storage locations after use.
Aircraft Commanders may request additional equipment be positioned aboard aircraft to
accommodate aircrew and passenger increases, as required.
