4. FOD Prevention Practices and Guidelines:
   4.1. Aircraft or equipment involved in a FOD incident is evaluated by 301 MXG/MXQ for
   possible impoundment. Notify 301 FW Safety Office and accomplish Air Force Reserve
   Command (AFRC) Form 42, Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Mishap Investigation
   Checksheet for all FOD incidents. Quality Assurance will conduct a thorough FOD mishap
   investigation to determine the root cause and to determine if any underlying problems exist.
   The results of this investigation will be reported as appropriate.
   4.2. When any item is lost on an aircraft, ensure a RED-X is placed in the Air Force
   Technical Order (AFTO) Form 781-A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document or
   equivalent forms system and that Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) and QA are
   notified. If any item is lost on an aircraft and not found by the end of the shift, an AFRC
   Form 174, Lost Tool/Object Report will be initiated. A thorough search will be directed to
   include the use of borescope, as appropriate, and Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) if
   necessary. If the item is not found, management will determine the appropriate course of
   action and document the results on the AFRC Form 174.
