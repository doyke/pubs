                                            Chapter 1

                               VISION & IMPLEMENTATION

1.1. Purpose. This chapter provides an overview of the Joint Capabilities Integration and
Development System (JCIDS) requirements process and highlights the interdependent
relationship between the Requirements process and the Defense Acquisition System, Test and
Evaluation and the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) processes.
1.2. Vision. The intent of this instruction is to facilitate timely development and fielding of
optimized, affordable and sustainable operational systems needed by the warfighter. The goal is
to fulfill stated defense strategy needs with effects based, capabilities-focused materiel and non-
materiel solutions. The approach to identifying capability requirements should not presuppose a
specific solution or end item. It should provide information related to forms and functions of
potential solutions that provide suitable, safe, and interoperable increments of capability for the
warfighter that are affordable throughout the life cycle and mitigate mission risk.
   1.2.1. Strategic Guidance. The overarching strategic guidance detailed in the National
   Security Strategy, the National Strategy for Homeland Security, the National Defense
   Strategy, the Quadrennial Defense Review, and the National Military Strategy provide the
   overarching description of the Nation’s defense interests, objectives and priorities.
   Additionally, the Defense Planning Guidance, the Guidance for the Employment of the
   Force, the Chairman’s Risk Assessment and the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan contain
   further guidance for objectives and priorities and provide a framework for an assessment of
   the Air Force’s (AF) needed capabilities.
   1.2.2. Joint Operational Context. Identified capability requirements must be traceable to
   Unified Command Plan assigned missions, approved Operations Plans/Contingency Plans,
   Joint Concepts, Integrated Security Constructs which are part of the DoD Analytic Baseline,
   and/or other driving factors. Capability requirements for Information Systems (IS) should use
   the existing DoD Information Enterprise Architecture and related solution architectures.
   Requirements must be defined in the lexicon established for the Universal Joint Tasks and
   relevant range of military operations. This operational context information forms the basis
   for validating requirements and associated gaps and risks, and supports recommendations for
   capability solutions.
   1.2.3. Service Core Functions. Identification of capability requirements and associated gaps
   begins with assigned organizational functions, roles, missions, and operations in the context
   of the overall strategic and operational goals. AF requirements derived from the Core
   Function Master Plans (CFMP) take into account capability gaps, a range of potential
   solutions (both non-materiel and materiel), an assessment of operational risk, and
   affordability.
1.3. JCIDS. The AF requirements process supports and implements the overarching joint
guidance, JCIDS, as described in CJCSI 3170.01, Joint Capabilities Integration and
Development System and the accompanying Joint Staff (JS)/J8 JCIDS Manual. The JCIDS
process supports identifying, assessing, validating, and prioritizing joint military capability
requirements while considering the full range of materiel and non-materiel solutions (i.e.,
Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel, Facilities and
 8                                                     AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


Policy (DOTmLPF-P)). All non-materiel solutions should be explored and, if possible,
implemented before initiating a materiel solution. Operational capabilities must be defined
within the “art of the possible” and grounded within real world constraints of time, technology,
and affordability.
     1.3.1. Joint Capability Areas (JCA). JCIDS uses JCAs as an organizing construct. This
     provides portfolios with similar capabilities functionally grouped to support capability
     analysis, strategy development, investment decisions, risk assessment and prioritization and
     capabilities- based planning and assessments. See the JS Joint Capabilities Areas for
     additional information.
     1.3.2. Requirements Documents Overview. Listed below are the different categories of
     requirements documents which are used to articulate capability requirements, associated
     capability gaps and to submit recommendations for review and validation.
        1.3.2.1. Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA). The CBA forms the analytic basis for
        operational capability requirements development and is an integral part of the
        capabilities-based planning process. The results of the CBA are captured in the CBA
        Final Report. See Chapter 4 for additional information on CBAs.
        1.3.2.2. The Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)/Information Systems-Initial
        Capabilities Document (IS-ICD). An ICD documents new capability requirements and
        associated gaps and the Sponsor’s intent to resolve those gaps through solutions which
        are materiel, non-materiel or a combination of both. See Chapter 4 for additional
        information on ICDs.
        1.3.2.3. Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). The AoA is an analytical comparison of the
        operational effectiveness, suitability, risk, and life cycle cost of alternatives that satisfy
        validated capability needs (usually stipulated in an approved ICD). The AoA process
        consists of three distinct documents; AoA Study Guidance, AoA Study Plan, and the
        AoA Final Report. See Chapter 4 for additional information on AoAs.
        1.3.2.4. Draft Capability Development Document (CDD). A Draft CDD is developed
        ((pre-Milestone (MS) A)) to inform the Technology Development Strategy and Request
        for Proposals for the Technology Development Phase (which follows the MS A
        acquisition decision). See Chapter 4 for additional information on CDDs.
        1.3.2.5. The CDD/Information Systems-Capability Development Document (IS-CDD).
        A CDD defines the authoritative, measureable and testable parameters ((Key
        Performance Parameters (KPPs), Key System Attributes (KSAs), and other attributes))
        necessary for the Engineering Manufacturing and Development Phase of the acquisition
        program. See Chapter 4 for additional information on CDDs and IS-CDDs.
        1.3.2.6. The Capability Production Document (CPD). A CPD defines the authoritative,
        measureable and testable parameters (KPPs, KSAs, and other attributes) necessary for the
        Production and Deployment phase of the acquisition program. See Chapter 4 for
        additional information on CPDs.
        1.3.2.7. The Joint or AF DOTmLPF-P Change Recommendation (Joint or AF DCR). A
        Joint/AF DCR documents the intent to resolve gaps with a non-materiel approach,
AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                            9


     recommending changes to the Joint/AF in one or more of the DOTmLPF-P areas. See
     Chapter 4 for additional information on Joint/AF DCRs.
     1.3.2.8. AF Form 1067, Modification Proposal. The Air Force has established an
     additional means to document capability requirements and associated capability gaps.
     The AF Form 1067 can be used to document the submission, review and approval of
     requirements for modifications to fielded Air Force systems. See Chapter 6 for more
     details on modifications.
     1.3.2.9. The Urgent Operational Need (UON), Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON)
     and Joint Emergent Operational Need (JEON). An urgent operational need request
     documents a requirement driven by an ongoing (UON/JUON) or emergent (JEON)
     contingency operation, which if not addressed, would result in unacceptable risk to life or
     combat mission accomplishment. Expedited staffing and review procedures are used for
     urgent need requests.          See Chapter 7 for additional information on
     UONs/JUONs/JEONs.
  1.3.3. Joint Staffing Designators (JSD). A JSD is assigned to all JCIDS documents by the
  JS/J8 Gatekeeper, based on the actual/potential Acquisition Category (ACAT) and Joint Staff
  equities (need for endorsements/certifications, special interest, previous guidance). The JSD
  sets the document staffing path/timeline and identifies validation authority. The JSD, along
  with the ACAT level, also provides the basis for determining the level of oversight and
  decision authority in the analytical efforts supporting the development of operational
  capability requirements. There are five Joint Staffing Designators: (1) Joint Requirements
  Oversight Council (JROC) Interest, (2) Joint Capability Board (JCB) Interest, (3) Joint
  Integration, (4) Joint Information and (5) Independent. JROC Interest and Joint Capability
  Board (JCB) Interest require component level and joint validation, i.e. Air Force
  Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC) followed by JCB/JROC. Joint Integration, Joint
  Information and Independent require component level validation only, i.e. AFROC. See
  Chapter 5 for additional information on JSD.
  1.3.4. Sources of AF Requirements Documents.          Listed below are the sources of AF
  requirements documents:
     1.3.4.1. Capabilities-Based Planning. Capabilities-based planning is the process of
     forecasting under uncertainty to provide capabilities that address warfighter effects and
     operational environments. The AF uses a Service-wide capabilities-based planning
     process where Core Function Lead Integrators (CFLI) develop their respective CFMPs
     based on AF strategic guidance, operational expertise and analysis. The CFLIs then
     prioritize the individual capabilities within their own CFMPs based on risk and fiscal
     projections through the planning period. Through CFLI planning, capability shortfalls,
     capability gaps and DOTmLPF-P opportunities are identified as potential inputs into the
     JCIDS process. CFLI assessments are also used to guide capabilities-based assessments
     (CBA).
     1.3.4.2. Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA). The CBA forms the analytic basis for
     operational capability requirements development and is an integral part of the
     capabilities-based planning process. In most situations, the CBA is the first step in the
     requirements process. The CBA defines the capability required and any capability
10                                                  AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


     gaps/shortfalls identified during the assessment. Additional details on the CBA are
     provided in Chapter 4.
     1.3.4.3. Top-Down Direction. Higher authority may direct a sponsor to initiate the
     development and fielding of an operational system to meet warfighter needs. Written
     direction from the Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) or higher authority fulfills the
     AFPD 10-6, Capability Requirements Development requirement for identifying a
     capability need. However, the designated sponsor is still responsible for conducting
     appropriate supporting analysis and producing the necessary operational capability
     requirements documents to support development and/or fielding and sustainment of an
     operational system. Top-Down Direction requests will be routed through the AFROC for
     requirements validation and will be processed via the QRC Process upon validation and
     CSAF signature (See Chapter 7).
     1.3.4.4. Combatant Command (CCMD) Needs. A CCMD may identify a capability
     gap/shortfall. These gaps or shortfalls are identified through their Integrated Priority List
     (IPL), a JUON or JEON. These requirements may be satisfied through two options: the
     normal acquisition process or the Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) process, as described
     in AFI 63-114, Quick Reaction Capability Process, and Chapter 7. Normal acquisition
     of CCMD’s need requires a Service Component sponsor who is responsible for
     conducting appropriate supporting analysis and producing the necessary operational
     capability requirements documents.
     1.3.4.5. Science & Technology (S&T) Activities.            Science and technological
     advancements and breakthroughs play a crucial role in providing warfighters with
     superior operational systems. Examples of programs and processes to demonstrate,
     mature, and transition technologies include: Advanced Technology Demonstrations
     (ATD), Joint Capability Technology Demonstrations (JCTD), Flagship Capability
     Concepts (FCC), experiments, operational exercises, war games, DoD and Air Force
     research efforts, and commercial sources identified within the Defense Science and
     Technology Program. Evaluation of the results of such activities may lead to a sponsor
     developing an appropriate operational capability requirements document to facilitate
     transition of mature and affordable technologies. For additional information on S&T
     activities refer to AFI 61-101, Management of Science and Technology.
        1.3.4.5.1. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/A5X is the OPR for all S&T processes
        within the purview of HQ AFSPC as the Lead Command. Refer to AFI 61-
        101_AFSPCSUP_I, Management of Science and Technology for additional
        information.
     1.3.4.6. Lessons Learned. A key method to achieve transformation of the Joint force is
     by producing compelling recommendations based on direct observations and sound
     analysis of current Joint operations, exercises and experiments. These recommendations
     (lessons) are derived from the full range of Joint activities and operations collected at the
     strategic, operational, and tactical level. Lessons assist senior leaders in making changes
     to DOTmLPF-P capabilities and guide associated programming, budgeting, and
     resourcing activities. To improve Joint capabilities and readiness, commanders may
     submit analytical observations directly to the Joint Lessons Learned Program (JLLP)
     through the Joint Lessons Learned Information System database, as described in CJCSI
AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                           11


       3150.25, Joint Lessons Learned Program, and/or to the Air Force Lessons Learned
       Program (AFL2P), as described in AFI 90-1601, Air Force Lessons Learned Program.
1.4. Implementation. Air Force requirements are driven by desired effects and needed
capabilities. All stakeholders in the acquisition framework must know why the Air Force needs
a particular capability, how and where it will be used, who will use it, when it is needed, and
how it will be supported and maintained. For a materiel solution, fielding an operational system
starts with sound strategies for concept refinement, requirements development, acquisition and
sustainment life cycle management, and test and evaluation (T&E). To be viable, these
strategies must be developed in concert and require early and ongoing collaboration among
operators, developers, programmers, systems engineers, acquirers, testers, sustainers, and
intelligence analysts. No one strategy can stand alone and still be viable, since all are
interdependent and require the integration of the others to be effective. Reference DoDI
5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System and AFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life
Cycle Management for additional information.

Table 1.1. Integration of AF Requirements, Acquisition and Test Processes




NOTE: See Attachment 1 for a list of acronyms.
12                                                 AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


  1.4.1. Expanding upon the collaborative effort, there are three mutually supporting AF
  processes that facilitate the development and sustainment of operational systems: operational
  capability requirements development as described in this instruction; acquisition and
  sustainment as described in AFI 63-101/20-101 and integrated operational testing as
  described in AFI 99-103, Capabilities-Based Test and Evaluation. These processes, along
  with the PPBE process outlined in AFI 65-601, Volume 3 The Air Force Budget Corporate
  Process, are interdependent and require collaboration to rapidly deliver new operational
  systems to the warfighter. The communities must use the guidance in all of these instructions
  to integrate their efforts and create synergy.
  1.4.2. Integrated Life Cycle Management. The primary goal of the acquisition and
  sustainment framework is to efficiently deliver affordable, effective (e.g., meets the
  warfighter’s needs) and sustainable operational systems. To achieve this goal, all
  stakeholders must collaborate throughout the requirements development process, and the
  planning and execution activities that lead to developing, fielding, and sustaining new
  operational systems. To maximize the potential for commercial and Non-Developmental
  Items (NDI) solutions, operational requirements should be stated in terms of performance or
  functionality and should be flexible to the greatest extent possible. After capability
  requirements and performance attributes are defined and approved, they are used to guide
  development, test and evaluation, production, procurement, deployment, sustainment, and
  ultimately disposal. Working with the operator, the acquirer builds an acquisition strategy
  that balances life cycle cost, schedule, and performance (operations and sustainment) in
  response to approved operational capability requirements documents. Regular recurring
  reviews throughout the requirements and acquisition processes ensure the desired capability
  meets the specified requirements, is delivered in a timely process, and is affordable. The
  acquisition strategy and the requirements strategy must align and be integrated through early
  collaborative development planning. Refer to AFI 63-101/20-101, for additional details.
     1.4.2.1. Development Planning (DP) and Early Systems Engineering (SE). Through the
     application of early systems engineering, DP activities decompose capability needs and
     characterize tradespace, formulate and evaluate viable concepts (to include Human
     Systems Integration (HSI) considerations), identify technology shortfalls, and assists the
     requirements community in refining requirements. The results of DP efforts are
     documented in Concept Characterization and Technical Description (CCTD) documents.
     The outcome of these activities are fiscally and technologically informed requirements, a
     range of feasible concepts, and vectors for S&T investment to reduce technology risks
     that support requirements and acquisition decisions and feed AoAs. DP provides the
     analytic basis for cost and capability trades to inform requirements development and
     oversight activities supporting acquisition milestones, decision points, and phases (refer
     to Table 1.1).
         1.4.2.1.1. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/A5X is the OPR for all DP processes within
         the purview of HQ AFSPC as the Lead Command.
     1.4.2.2. Intelligence Support Considerations. Most warfighting weapon systems require
     intelligence inputs to include threat and mission data. Intelligence specialists provide the
     necessary interface to the national Intelligence Community (IC) with which to access
     intelligence data and to enter into formal IC production requirements and planning
     processes. Not all requirements for intelligence data are supportable, in which case
AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                            13


     intelligence must be considered from a cost / capability perspective. Early collaboration
     between Requirements, Acquisition, and Intelligence communities is critical to ensuring
     decisions regarding desired materiel solutions fully account for capability impacts
     presented by intelligence dependencies.
     1.4.2.3. Materiel Solution Cost-Effective Prioritization. In accordance with DoD
     Acquisition policy, once a determination is made that a capability gap requires a materiel
     solution, seek the most cost-effective solution over the system’s life cycle. The order of
     preference shall be: 1) procurement or modification of commercially available (domestic
     or foreign sources) or dual-use item, 2) additional production or modification of
     previously-developed US/allied item, 3) cooperative development with allies, 4) new
     joint US development program, and 5) new DoD component-unique development
     program.
     1.4.2.4. Evolutionary Acquisition. In this process, a needed operational capability is met
     over time by developing several increments, each dependent on available mature
     technology. Each increment of a system must provide a useful capability solution that is
     safe, operationally effective, and suitable for use in the intended environment. A CDD
     may cover single or multiple increments, but it must clearly articulate which KPPs/KSAs
     apply to each increment. A CPD describes a single increment of a system.
  1.4.3. Integrated Test and Evaluation (T&E). The overarching functions of T&E are to
  mature system designs, manage risks, identify and help resolve deficiencies as early as
  possible, and ensure systems are operationally mission capable (i.e., effective and suitable).
  Integrated testing is the collaborative planning and execution of test phases and events to
  provide shared data in support of independent analysis, evaluation, and reporting by all
  stakeholders, particularly the developmental (both contractor and government) and
  operational test and evaluation communities. Integrated testing structures T&E to reduce the
  time it takes to field effective and suitable systems by providing qualitative and quantitative
  information to decision makers throughout the program's life cycle. T&E stakeholders are
  integrated early within the Requirements and Acquisition development processes. Early
  collaboration between the Requirements, Acquisition, and Test communities ensures the
  materiel solution delivered to the warfighter meets the desired capability requirements and
  operates as intended. Refer to AFI 99-103 for additional details.
  1.4.4. Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE). The PPBE process
  contains four distinct, but inter-related phases. The Planning Phase, identifies capability
  requirements through planning and programming guidance. The Programming Phase, creates
  the AF portion of the Department of Defense’s (DoD) Future Years Defense Program
  (FYDP). The Budgeting Phase, formulates and controls resource allocation and use. The
  Execution Phase, evaluates spending to determine the extent desired capabilities are
  achieved. Together these phases make up the PPBE process. AF/A8 provides financial
  guidance throughout the requirements process and advises the requirements community to
  aid and assist requirements decision-makers in making sound, fiscally informed decisions.
  Funding should not be programmed without clear linkages to documented operational
  capability gaps. Program funding will be aligned with the validated requirement for each
  acquisition phase. Early and continued collaboration between Requirements, Acquisition and
  PPBE communities ensures AF resources are optimally employed. Refer to AFI 65-601, for
  additional details.

1.5. Policy. The CSAF has directed AF/A5R to be the single focal point for all operational
requirements issues and the AFROC is the AF corporate board for validation of operational
capability requirements. There are subsets of organizations that assist AF/A5R in executing AF
requirements, however; AF/A5R may request the AFROC review of any of these programs, as
required. Unless otherwise required to obtain joint validation, in accordance with CJCSI
3170.01, the following authorities apply.
   1.5.1. Requirements that are primarily or wholly medical or medical support in nature are
   validated under the Surgeon General’s Requirements for Operational Capabilities Council.
   OPR is AF/SG5R.
   1.5.2. Requirements that are primarily or wholly related to security forces functional issues
   are validated under the AF Security Force Center process. OPR is AF/A7SX.
   1.5.3. United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has validation authority for
   requirements (JCB Interest and below) and urgent needs unique to Special Operations. OPR
   is AF/A3O.
   1.5.4. The Defense Business Council has validation authority for Defense Business Systems
   (DBS). OPR is SAF/US(M).
   1.5.5. Operational Information Systems (IS) solutions where associated hardware is
   Commercial off the Shelf/Government off the Shelf (COTS/GOTS) and software
   development costs are less than $15M are not required to use the JCIDS process. MAJCOMs
   have approval authority for IS solutions with software development costs less than $15M.
       1.5.5.1. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/A5 is the approval authority for IS solution
       requirements where the MAJCOM is the approval authority.
       1.5.5.2. (Added-AFSPC) Requirements Team Leads (RL) will use the Joint
       Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) Manual IS-ICD format for IS
       solutions where the MAJCOM is the approval authority to facilitate HQ AFSPC/A5
       review and approval.
       1.5.5.3. (Added-AFSPC) Staffing for such documents will be conducted by the HQ
       AFSPC RL, and include all pertinent stakeholders, to include the anticipated program
       office.
   1.5.6. The Nuclear Weapons Council (NWC) has oversight of Joint DoD/Department of
   Energy (DOE) nuclear weapons life cycle activities per DODI 5030.55, DoD Procedures for
   Joint DoD-DOE Nuclear Weapons Life Cycle Activities. These joint programs support
   nuclear deterrence capability requirements that may be outside of the JCIDS process. During
   Joint DoD/DOE program executions, the DoD/AF will comply with JCIDS requirements, as
   applicable, when developing DoD-specific components or subcomponents to a nuclear
   weapon. OPR is AF/A10.
   1.5.7. Requirements that are primarily funded with National Intelligence Program funding
   will be developed, reviewed and validated in accordance with the Intelligence Community
   (IC) Capability Requirements process. OPR is AF/A2.
   1.5.8. Requirements that are primarily funded with Military Intelligence Program funding
   will be developed, reviewed and validated under the JCIDS process. OPR is AF/A2.

                  REQUIREMENTS DEVELOPMENT & OVERSIGHT

3.1. Purpose. This chapter provides a description of the AF-specific requirements development
and oversight process and procedures.

Figure 3.1. AF Requirements Development and Oversight Activities Supporting
Acquisition Milestones, Decision Points and Phases.




3.2. Overview. The requirements development process begins when a CBA or other source
identifies a new requirement and leads a MAJCOM Sponsor to propose a new JCIDS document.
Before any JCIDS action can be taken, the sponsor prepares an initial requirements strategy,
submits the request to AF/A5R-P for an AF Gatekeeper review, and ultimately presents the
proposal to the AFRRG for approval. The purpose of this initial RSR will be to gain corporate
AF buy-in and agreement to proceed forward and enter JCIDS. Following AFRRG approval, the
sponsor may then initiate document development via the HPT concept. The AFRRG will review
the draft document before submitting it for formal JCIDS staffing, followed by validation and
approval via AFROC, and JCB/JROC (when required). For subsequent documents supporting
the next phase of acquisition, the process repeats when the sponsor develops the document
strategy for the follow-on document (CDD, CPD) and submits an RSR request for AF
Gatekeeper review.
3.3. AF Gatekeeper (AFGK) Review. An AFGK review is an O-6 level review conducted by
AF/A5R-P with appropriate AF/A5R division(s) to assess a program’s readiness from a
procedural compliance standpoint to meet entry criteria for the next step in the requirements
process.
   3.3.1. An AFGK review is conducted for all RSRs (pre-HPT), all Document Reviews (post-
   HPT) and as part of the normal prep-cycle leading up to any AFRRG review. AFGK
   approval is required before proceeding with the next step in the requirements process. An
   AFGK review can be waived at the discretion of AF/A5R-P.

   3.3.2. AFGK Activity. During the AFGK Review, AF/A5R-P and appropriate AF/A5R
   Division(s) provide guidance and instruction to the document sponsor in preparation for the
   RSR and HPT; review any previous documentation and/or higher headquarters direction,
   decision memoranda; ensure necessary involvement from AF organizations, OSD, Joint Staff
   and other Services or Agencies.
   3.3.3. AFGK Output. The AFGK will provide the document sponsor with direction or
   required actions to be accomplished (as necessary). Actions will be captured via email.
3.4. Requirements Strategy Review (RSR). Purpose of the RSR is to provide an initial review
of a program before entering the JCIDS process or to conduct a follow-on review of a program
after it has entered JCIDS. See the AF/A5R-P Requirements Portal pages for additional
information on the RSR process (procedures, checklists, timelines, and templates).
   3.4.1. Initial RSR. An Initial RSR is conducted by the AFRRG before convening the HPT
   event for initial entry into the JCIDS process (e.g. ICD). The AFRRG will provide a cross
   functional, corporate evaluation of identified requirement gap(s) and determine how to best
   to close the identified gap through solutions which are materiel, non-materiel or a
   combination of both. An Initial RSR will also be used in situations where a non-AF ICD is
   intended to be used in place of an AF-sponsored ICD to initiate an AF program. In this case,
   an RSR would be required before to convening the HPT to begin work on the AoA Study
   Guidance and Study Plan.
   3.4.2. Follow-on RSR. A Follow-on RSR is normally conducted by the AFGK before
   convening the HPT event for follow-on requirements documentation for a previously
   approved and ongoing AF program (e.g. AoA Study Plan, AoA Final Report, CDD, CPD).
   The RSR by the AF/GK may be elevated to the AFRRG or AFROC, as directed, to review
   program changes that have occurred since the initial strategy was approved (e.g. significant
   changes in requirements, funding, or schedule).
   3.4.3. The sponsor develops the requirements strategy in collaboration with the appropriate
   AF CFLI, Operating Command (operators), and Implementing Command representatives (to
   include systems engineers, testers, sustainers, and acquisition-intelligence analysts.) The
   AFGK/AFRRG will review the requirements strategy to include the following as applicable:
       3.4.3.1. The sponsor’s CBA, the traceability to the CFMP and other CFMPs, and the
       linkages to the foundational requirements documents.
       3.4.3.2. The risk assessment.
       3.4.3.3. Relevant concepts that propose and describe solutions to the identified capability
       gap.
       3.4.3.4. Determine if a materiel solution, non-materiel solution, or a combination of the
       two is required to mitigate the gap, determine which gaps will be mitigated in the CDD,
       or review the gaps mitigated by the CPD.
       3.4.3.5. Determine/Review the scope for the proposed strategy/solution (e.g. single
       increment, multiple increments).
       3.4.3.6. Determine when the capability needs to be delivered and how it will be
       sustained.
AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                               41


       3.4.3.7. Project follow-on requirements oversight reviews and determine necessary
       interaction with the Joint Staff, other Services and OSD (if required).
       3.4.3.8. Determine possible interaction(s) with other AF or joint systems.
       3.4.3.9. Review proposed nomenclature; the proposed name of the ICD should reflect
       the core gap. CDD/CPDs will normally reflect the proposed solution.
       3.4.3.10. Assess the initial affordability goal within the appropriate portfolio to close the
       identified gaps.
       3.4.3.11. Review the proposed or documented KPPs, KSAs, and additional attributes.
       3.4.3.12. Review solution costs to ensure solution remains affordable. Research
       Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) costs, Procurement costs and Lifecycle
       costs.
       3.4.3.13. Review HPT membership and format (i.e. live or virtual).
   3.4.4. RSR Requirements. An Initial RSR is required for all AF sponsored programs
   entering the JCIDS requirements process regardless of where the program enters the process
   (e.g. ICD, CDD, CPD, or Joint DCR). A Follow-on RSR is conducted to ensure a
   requirements program is progressing as intended before initiating each subsequent
   requirements document.
   3.4.5. RSR Request Package. RSR packages will be submitted to AF/A5R-P from the Lead
   Command sponsor (O-6 level) NLT 60 days before the planned HPT event. See the
   AF/A5R-P Requirements Portal page for RSR Package checklist and templates.
   3.4.6. RSR Output. The AFGK/AFRRG will provide the document sponsor with specific
   guidance and required actions to be accomplished (as necessary). Actions/decisions will be
   captured per prescribed AFGK or AFRRG procedures. The RSR decision and associated
   actions will be archived in IRSS.
3.5. High Performance Team (HPT). The purpose of the HPT is to provide the appropriate
level of consistent cross-functional involvement in requirements generation from ICD to CPD to
produce executable, risk-based, fiscally informed requirements that deliver affordable
capabilities at optimal cycle time to the warfighter. The HPT concept is used to develop AF
sponsored JCIDS documents, AoA Study Guidance, and AoA Study Plan. The HPT accelerates
the documentation process, improves the quality of the requirements document, and can provide
an enduring forum for developing, fielding, and sustaining operational systems.
   3.5.1. HPT Training. Sponsor leads and the HPT facilitator will be RMCT level B certified
   and other HPT members are highly encouraged to be RMCT level B certified. See Chapter
   8 for further guidance on RMCT requirements.
   3.5.2. HPT Membership. HPT success hinges on participation from members with strong
   functional and requirements expertise. A representative from AF/A5R will normally
   facilitate an HPT. AFMC/OAS will normally facilitate HPTs for developing the AoA Study
   Guidance, and AoA Study Plan. In situations where an AF/A5R facilitator is unable to
   participate, AF/A5R-P will provide just in time training to a MAJCOM facilitator.
   Additionally, AF/A5R-P will maintain checklists, guides, templates, best practices and tips to
   ensure consistency and standardization in document development. HPT membership is made
 42                                                  AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


   up of core and support representatives. HPT membership is enduring throughout the
   requirements process and is determined at the RSR and reviewed at subsequent AFGK
   reviews before initiating an HPT. Core members are typically present for all HPT functions,
   but participation can be tailored based on the subject matter and is adjusted at the AFGK
   review. Support members are typically not physically present but available via phone or e-
   mail for reach back. See Figure 3.2 for additional information on the enduring HPT
   membership concept.
   3.5.3. Electronic HPT. Depending on the topic and level of work required to be
   accomplished, an HPT may be conducted electronically (VTC, phone, email).

Figure 3.2. Enduring HPT Membership




3.6. Air Force Requirements Review Group (AFRRG). The AFRRG is a corporately
chartered, decision making body which provides direct support to the AFROC. The AFRRG is
charged with conducting an initial RSR for all programs entering the JCIDS process, reviewing
all AF sponsored JCIDS documents before staffing and reviewing all AF sponsored AoA
documentation before A5R/AFROC approval as appropriate. During these reviews the AFRRG
will focus on gap mitigation, operational utility, affordability, life cycle costs vs. capability
analysis, operational and/or force management risk. Additionally, the AFRRG will provide a
cross functional review of select program SRDs before MAJCOM endorsement. Reference
Figure 3.1 for when AFRRGs are required.
   3.6.1. AFRRG Participation. The AFRRG is chaired by AF/DA5R and is composed of O-6
   level voting principals from designated MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, and HAF organizations. In
   addition, AFRRG membership includes several advisory functions to assist principals in their
   decision-making processes. AFRRG membership mirrors the AFROC principals and
   advisors. AFRRG principals are required to attend all AFRRG functions or notify and obtain
   AFRRG Chairman approval for any designated alternate.
AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                          43


   3.6.2. AFRRG Output. The AFRRG decision and associated actions will be captured in an
   AFRRG Memorandum (AFRRGM) and archived in the IRSS database.
3.7. Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC).             The AFROC provides
validation decisions for AF operational requirements documents and issues that impact
requirements. See Paragraph 2.3.25 and the AF/A5R-P Requirements Portal pages for additional
information on the AFROC process. Reference Figure 3.1. for when AFROCs are required.
   3.7.1. AFROC Participation. The AFROC is chaired by AF/A5R and is composed of
   General Officer and Civilian Senior Executives (CSE) level voting principals from
   designated MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, and HAF organizations. In addition, AFROC
   membership includes several advisory functions to assist principals in their decision-making
   processes. AFROC principals are required to attend all AFROC functions or notify and
   obtain AF/A5R approval for any designated alternate.
   3.7.2. AFROC Output. The AFROC decision and associated actions will be captured in an
   AFROCM and archived in the IRSS database.
3.8. Electronic AFRRG or AFROC (eAFRRG/eAFROC). An eAFRRG or eAFROC may be
convened in cases where a decision is needed to be made by the AFRRG or AFROC body
outside of the regularly scheduled AFRRG/AFROC cycle or in cases where the regular agenda is
full and cannot wait until the next scheduled requirements review. eAFRRG and eAFROC will
normally provide the principals five working days to review the materials. Principals are
required to respond to eAFRRG/eAFROC in accordance with the AFRRG/AFROC Charter.
3.9. Functional Capabilities Boards (FCB). Joint Staff FCBs are established according to
JCAs to assist the JCB and JROC. Service sponsored requirements documents are assigned to
FCBs based on JCAs. FCBs and FCB Working Groups provide the analytical underpinning for
developing and refining issues that support JCB/JROC recommendations. AF FCB Leads ensure
AF interests are represented throughout the Joint Staff process.
3.10. Joint Capabilities Board (JCB). The JCB assists the JROC in carrying out its duties and
responsibilities. The JCB reviews and, if appropriate, endorses all operational capability
requirements documents designated as JROC Interest before their submission to the JROC. The
JCB reviews and validates operational capability requirements documents designated as JCB
Interest. JCB outcomes and decisions are captured in a JROC Memorandum (JROCM).
Guidance on the JCB is provided in CJCSI 5123.01, Charter of the Joint Requirements Oversight
Council.
3.11. Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC). The JROC reviews and validates
operational requirements documents with a JSD of JROC Interest. The JROC, at its discretion,
may review any operational requirements document or any other issues that may have Joint
interests or impacts. AF/A5R tracks and facilitates issues through the JCIDS process and
prepares the VCSAF for JROC participation. JROC outcomes and decisions are captured in a
JROCM. AF/A5R will ensure JROCMs that require specific AF actions are tasked to the
appropriate HAF Functional/MAJCOM. Guidance on the JROC is provided in CJCSI 5123.01.
3.12. (Added-AFSPC) AFSPC Requirements Development. When HQ AFSPC is assigned
as the Lead Command for a needed capability, it has the responsibility to develop and document
operational capability requirements in accordance with the provisions of this AFI. HQ
AFSPC/A5 appoints a RL to be the agent for executing this responsibility. The ICT assists the
 44                                                 AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


RL in this effort. The HQ AFSPC Requirements Group and Board review the requirements,
while HQ AFSPC/A5X, Strategic Requirements Division, provides functional support for the
requirements process and ensures the RL can successfully navigate the staffing and approval
processes within HQ AFSPC and through the Air Staff and Joint Staff. HQ AFSPC/A5X assists
and advises RLs on standardized briefing formats for HQ AFSPC Requirements Group and
Board processes, as well as AFROC briefing templates, which can be found in the Information
and Resource Support System (IRSS) on SIPRNet. To obtain an IRSS account contact HQ
AFSPC/A5XS.
   3.12.1. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/A5X serves as the primary POC between the
   MAJCOM and AF/A5R-P for all process and policy issues. All submissions for AF
   Gatekeeper, AFRRG or AFROC consideration will be made by A5X.
   3.12.2. (Added-AFSPC) Requirements Team Lead (RL). The RL is the focal point for
   developing, coordinating, and gaining approval for the operational capability requirements
   documents. The RL is also the primary advocate for the resultant solution. The RL
   represents HQ AFSPC and AF positions in the requirements process through each acquisition
   milestone as discussed in this AFI. As such, the RL must be a government employee. The
   RL will:
       3.12.2.1. (Added-AFSPC) Serve as the primary POC between the MAJCOM and the
       SME Division within AF/A5R. The RL will provide HQ AFSPC/A5X with evidence of
       AF/A5R SME division concurrence prior to requesting submittal of draft documents to
       the AF Gatekeeper, AFRRG or AFROC.
       3.12.2.2. (Added-AFSPC) Provide advocacy and supporting documentation to the HQ
       AFSPC PEM as part of the PPBE process for obtaining funding for the development of a
       capability solution. The RL may also serve as a HQ AFSPC PEM for PORs on the
       related subject area or funding line.
       3.12.2.3. (Added-AFSPC) Brief HQ AFSPC Requirements Group and Board on
       requirements programs, and present decision briefings to the AFRRG and AFROC.
       3.12.2.4. (Added-AFSPC) The RL will keep the responsible Division Chief, HQ
       AFSPC/A5, HQ AFSPC/A3, all pertinent directorates, HQ AFSPC PEM, and program
       office informed of program progress through the ICT.
       3.12.2.5. (Added-AFSPC) Additional process guidance/timelines are available in the
       Requirements Team Lead Handbook located on the A5X web site.
       3.12.2.6. (Added-AFSPC) Identify technology needs, develop technology roadmaps
       and track AFRL's efforts to support technology maturation in collaboration with SMC.
       Additionally, RLs advocate for future and enabling concepts which help organize
       maturing technologies, new CONOPS and desired capabilities in a way to explore
       alternate future systems and guide S&T and R&D investments along with capability-
       based requirements document development.
   3.12.3. (Added-AFSPC) Integrated Concept Team (ICT). When tasked to pursue a
   capability solution (materiel or non-materiel), the RL forms and leads an ICT on behalf of A5
   to develop requirements for the capability solution. The tasking may be the result of top-
   down direction, IPP, or other analysis identified via the CBA methodology. The RL is the
AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                          45


  chair of the ICT with the authority to task members to accomplish the actions needed to
  develop and coordinate capabilities documents. The RL will prepare a charter for the team to
  be approved by the appropriate HQ AFSPC/A5 Division Chief. Refer to the Requirements
  Team Lead Handbook for ICT charter information.
     3.12.3.1. (Added-AFSPC) The ICT is normally an action officer-level working group.
     The ICT assists the RL in defining the requirements and coordinating the requirements
     documents. The ICT is formed by the RL requesting participation from stakeholders.
     The team will consist of members from each directorate, as necessary, plus other
     stakeholders who have responsibility for operational use, acquisition, sustainment,
     testing, training, exercises, information assurance and interoperability. Cyber RLs will
     coordinate activities with HQ AFSPC/A3I-led Cyber Weapon System Teams (WST) to
     achieve synergies and prevent duplication of effort. The user, product center
     representative (from SMC or AFLCMC) and HQ AFSPC-level PEM are key participants
     of the ICT. In addition, representatives from the capability HPT and from other
     services/agencies in joint mission areas may be members. ICT members will keep their
     organizations informed of program status.
     3.12.3.2. (Added-AFSPC) Once the ICT has drafted an initial set of requirements, the
     RL requests permission to form a HPT to write the capability document leading to a
     capability solution. The request is in the form of a briefing called the Requirements
     Strategy Review (RSR), and is presented to the AFRRG, normally via secure VTC.
     Reference the AF/A5R-P web page for recommended HPT membership and RSR
     information. The resultant document(s) will then enter staffing IAW Chapter 3 of this
     AFI.
     3.12.3.3. (Added-AFSPC) Training Planning Team (TPT). The TPT is a subset of the
     ICT and is the primary body for identification of training requirements in the acquisition
     and management of training systems. Reference AFSPCI 36-283, Space Training
     Systems Management for additional details.
  3.12.4. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC Requirements Reviews. After completion of AF and
  Joint coordination and comment resolution, operational capability requirements documents
  will be reviewed by the HQ AFSPC Requirements Group/Board process.
     3.12.4.1. (Added-AFSPC) The HQ AFSPC Requirements Group meeting is chaired by
     the HQ AFSPC/DA5, with the respective A5 Division Chief(s) in attendance. Voting
     membership consists of Deputy Directors or the appropriate Division Chief(s)
     representing each Directorate. The RL will present the draft AFROC briefing for the
     proposed requirements document. The Group thoroughly analyzes all issues and makes
     recommendations to the RL and the Board. HQ AFSPC/A5X acts as secretariat for the
     HQ AFSPC Requirements Group.
     3.12.4.2. (Added-AFSPC) The HQ AFSPC Requirements Board is chaired by HQ
     AFSPC/A5, with other Directors as voting members. This is the second level of
     corporate review for documents going forward to the AFROC. The Board also
     approves/disapproves CBA initiation proposals and subsequent CBA reports. HQ
     AFSPC/A5X acts as secretariat for the AFSPC Requirements Board.
 46                                                 AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


       3.12.4.3. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/A5X will schedule and announce the
       Requirements Group/Board meetings, and distribute electronic briefing slides
       approximately 2 days prior to the scheduled meeting.
       3.12.4.4. (Added-AFSPC) For documents requiring AFSPC/CC certification IAW AFI
       63-101_20-101, and/or AFSPC/CC/CV transmittal memo IAW this AFI, the RL will
       forward a staff package through their respective Division Chief and HQ AFSPC/A5 for
       CV/CC approval and signature. If directed, the RL will meet with CV/CC to brief the
       proposed document. Reference the Requirements Team Lead Handbook located on the
       HQ AFSPC/A5X web page for specific procedures and templates.
       3.12.4.5. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/A5, along with the respective PM, will attest to
       the AFROC the feasibility of requirements in delegated ACAT II and all ACAT III
       CDDs/CPDs for which SMC provides the program manager.             Reference the
       Requirements Team Lead Handbook located on the HQ AFSPC/A5X web page for
       specific procedures and templates.
       3.12.4.6. (Added-AFSPC) After Group/Board approval and CV/CC review (if
       required), the RL, through HQ AFSPC/A5X, will schedule and present the requirements
       document to the AFROC for AF approval. JCB /JROC Interest documents (as designated
       by JS/J8) will proceed through the FCB/JCB/JROC respectively for final approval. This
       entire process is repeated for each subsequent requirements document (CDD and CPD) as
       a program matures.
       3.12.4.7. (Added-AFSPC) Transmittal. A transmittal memo will accompany all
       requirements documents loaded into IRSS for AFROC consideration. For ACAT I
       documents, the transmittal memo will be signed by AFSPC/CC. AFSPC/CV will sign
       the memo for ACAT II documents, and AFSPC/A5 for ACAT III documents. Reference
       the Requirements Team Lead Handbook located on the HQ AFSPC/A5X web page for
       specific procedures and templates.
3.13. (Added-AFSPC) CDDs and CPDs: Are source documents for product centers to
produce SRDs. SRDs to be used in conjunction with a request for proposal (RFP) will be
coordinated with the cognizant HQ AFSPC/A5 division prior to release of the final RFP. This
ensures common understanding between the requirements and acquisition communities
regarding capability requirements and requirements documents used for solicitation.
Coordination will be IAW AFI 63-101_20-101. Reference the Requirements Team Lead
Handbook located on the HQ AFSPC/A5X web page for specific procedures and templates.
3.14. (Added-AFSPC) AFSPC/CC Touch Points for Requirements. As commander of the
Lead MAJCOM with organize, train and equip responsibilities for space and cyberspace
operations, and as Component-MAJCOM commander to USSTRATCOM for space and
cyberspace operations, AFSPC/CC must have direct influence in the development of warfighter
requirements. As such, the RL will prepare briefings and/or staff packages for CC consideration
at key “touch points” in the life cycle of the concept-to-reality development of requirements as
deemed necessary by HQ AFSPC/A5. These points may include, but are not limited to, enabling
concept completion, all ACAT I (or potential ACAT I) CDD/CPDs prior to AFROC exposure,
and program reviews prior to each milestone. For all ACAT programs (I-III), the AFSPC/CC
must consent to any changes to KPPs or key system attributes (KSA) prior to presentation to the
AFROC.

                                           Chapter 4

    GUIDANCE FOR STUDIES & ANALYSIS & REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTS

4.1. Purpose. This chapter provides a description of AF requirements studies and analysis
activities and JCIDS/AF requirements documents. It provides guidance for developing AF
sponsored CBAs, ICDs, AoA Study Guidance, AoA Study Plans, AoA Final Reports, Draft
CDDs, CDDs, CPDs, IS-ICDs, IS-CDDs, Joint DCRs, and AF DCRs. Additionally, this chapter
includes guidance on developing KPPs and KSAs for the Draft CDD, CDD and CPD.
4.2. Overview. The requirements process operates in an iterative manner where initial
capability requirements drive the early acquisition process, and the early acquisition process
drives updates to capability requirements documents related to specific materiel and non-materiel
capability solutions being pursued. The JCIDS process refines the capability requirements
through each successive requirements document. The operational capability requirements
process normally begins with the execution of a CBA.
4.3. CBA. The CBA is the first formal study in the requirements process. The CBA forms the
analytic basis for operational capability requirements development and is an integral part of the
capabilities-based planning process. A CBA is an analytic basis to identify requirements and
associated gaps in context of warfighting risk. In the early stages of the CBA, analysts should
consult the Contract Studies Registry Program for related or similar studies and the Joint Lessons
Information System database for any applicable information. The CBA consists of the following
activities: analyzing what is required for the warfighter across specific functional areas to
accomplish the assigned mission (defining the capability required), comparing the capability
required to the capabilities provided by any existing and programmed systems (gap analysis),
and identifying associated gaps and/or redundancies. Assigned missions should be designated
AF missions with approved CONOPs. The final step of the CBA is to analyze the full
DOTmLPF-P spectrum where the “m” is existing materiel in the inventory (COTS, GOTS, or
NDI). The CBA will determine to what extent the gaps can be closed or mitigated without the
acquisition of new materiel. Study Plans and Final Reports are required for all CBAs and should
conform to the guidance provided below. Additional details on the CBA are provided in the
JS/J8 JCIDS Manual, and the AFMC/OAS analysis handbooks.

Figure 4.1. Requirements Overview – CBA




   4.3.1. CBA Study Plan. The CBA Study Plan outlines the mission area(s) to be analyzed in
   the CBA.
      4.3.1.1. Entry Criteria. The sponsor will notify the MAJCOM Director of Requirements
      for approval to proceed before initiating CBA Study Plan.
      4.3.1.2. HPT Guidance. An HPT is not required for a CBA Study Plan but Lead
      Commands are encouraged to establish effective dialog with key stakeholders to fully
      define the scope of the operational deficiency.
      4.3.1.3. Review & Staffing Guidance. There is no HAF review or staffing required for
      CBA Study Plans. Lead Commands will submit a study initiation notice to AF/A5R-P
      upon initiation of CBA.
      4.3.1.4. Approval Criteria. The MAJCOM Director of Requirements, or higher,
      approves the CBA Study Plan. See the AFMC/OAS Handbook for additional guidance
      on the CBA Study Plan.
      4.3.1.5. Exit Criteria. An approved study plan by the MAJCOM Director of
      Requirements, or higher, completes the CBA Study Plan process.
   4.3.2. CBA Final Report. The sponsor is responsible for executing the CBA with assistance
   from AFMC/OAS. Ideally, core membership for a CBA study team includes representatives
   from the appropriate CFLI, Lead Command, Operating Command, Implementing
   Command(s), HAF Division(s), representatives from other agencies/Services, combatant
   commands, and others as needed. The CBA Final Report captures and presents the
   methodology and results of the analysis. The CBA results outlined in the final report are
   further developed into COAs. The identified COAs will reside within the body of the CBA
   Final Report. Additional guidance is available in the AFMC/OAS analysis handbooks.
      4.3.2.1. Entry Criteria. A MAJCOM approved CBA study plan is required to proceed
      with the execution of the CBA.
AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                        49


     4.3.2.2. HPT Guidance. An HPT is not required for a CBA Final Report; though the key
     stakeholders and representatives should be involved in the development of the final
     report.
     4.3.2.3. Review & Staffing Guidance. There is no HAF review or staffing required for
     CBA Final Reports.
     4.3.2.4. Approval Criteria. In order to substantiate follow on JCIDS activities, the CBA
     must address the following issues:
        4.3.2.4.1. Identification of gaps and recommendations about which gaps and risks do
        not need to be addressed at this time; which gaps have acceptable operational risk.
        4.3.2.4.2. Identification of what degree each gap can be mitigated by better use of
        current capability, as described in approved concepts, and the resulting impact on
        operational risk. This should include recommendations concerning the changes to
        doctrine and/or Tactics, Techniques and Procedures.
        4.3.2.4.3. Identification of how much of each gap can be solved with changes in
        DOTmLPF-P rather than pursuing a new materiel solution. This should include
        recommendations concerning the Joint DCRs and AF DCRs that should be
        developed.
        4.3.2.4.4. Recommendations about whether buying additional quantities of a
        previously acquired system would mitigate the gap.    This should include
        recommendations concerning the Joint DCRs and AF DCRs that should be
        developed.
        4.3.2.4.5. Recommendations about whether S&T investments are required before
        initiation of any acquisition activities. Concepts should be documented in CCTDs
        and be technically feasible within possible programmatic limits.
        4.3.2.4.6. Recommendations on which gaps can be mitigated by making changes to
        current and ongoing acquisition programs and efforts, and which ones may require a
        new materiel solution and should be included in an ICD.
        4.3.2.4.7. Identification of the minimum key values and the tradespace curves that
        define the key values.
        4.3.2.4.8. Identification of the rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimates for
        each of the identified potential solutions (non-materiel or materiel).

     4.3.2.5. Exit Criteria. A CBA Final Report is approved by the MAJCOM Director of
     Requirements, or higher. Once the CBA Final Report has been approved, the MAJCOM
     requirements office/FOA will forward the final report to AF/A5R-P. AF/A5R-P will
     archive the final report in the IRSS database and submit the CBA, as appropriate, to the
     JS.

4.4. ICD. If the CBA recommends a materiel solution, the next step in the requirements process
is an ICD. ICD development occurs before MDD. The ICD along with the AoA Study
Guidance and AoA Study Plan, are required to proceed to a MDD. The ICD documents the need
for a new materiel approach(es) to satisfy specific capability gap(s). The ICD articulates the
necessity to resolve the specific capability gap(s) identified typically through an approved CBA.
The follow-on of an ICD could be one or more Draft CDDs, CDDs, CPDs, Joint DCRs, or a
combination of these documents. Reference the JCIDS Manual and the AF/A5R-P website for
additional guidance on ICDs.

Figure 4.2. Requirements Overview – ICD




   4.4.1. Entry Criteria. A MAJCOM approved CBA or equivalent analysis is required to
   proceed to an RSR request for an ICD. The CBA/analysis must be based upon an approved
   CONOPS and include a risk assessment that indicates significant operational risk. The
   CBA/analysis must also document that the way to mitigate the gap is with a materiel
   solution. ICD initiation requires an Initial RSR and approval to proceed with ICD
   development from the AFRRG.
   4.4.2. ICD Strategy Development. The ICD requirements strategy establishes the path
   necessary to develop a quality ICD that is capable of guiding future capability development
   activities. Continuous collaboration ensures the requirements strategy addresses required
   capabilities identified in the CBA and/or applicable Joint and AF concepts, capabilities-based
   planning documents and other pertinent guidance.
   4.4.3. RSR Guidance. An Initial RSR is required for all ICDs. Refer to Paragraph 3.4 for
   additional RSR guidance.
   4.4.4. HPT Guidance. An HPT is required for all AF sponsored ICDs. Refer to Paragraph
   3.5 for additional HPT guidance and membership criteria.
   4.4.5. Review & Staffing Guidance. After the ICD is developed, it is reviewed by the
   AFRRG for approval to initiate initial staffing (Reference Paragraph 5.3), validated by the
   AFROC, and approved by the CSAF (ACAT I) or VCSAF. The level of Joint review and
AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                                51


   validation beyond the AFROC is dependent upon the document’s JSD. See Table 5.1 for
   additional details.
   4.4.6. Approval Criteria. The ICD will comply with the JCIDS Manual format(s) and
   guidance. Additionally, during the AFRRG and AFROC reviews, as a minimum, the
   following items will be reviewed:
       4.4.6.1. A description of the capability gap and the operational and/or force management
       risk of not filling the gap that includes a clear description of current/programmed
       capability compared to the capability required to meet the mission at some future date. A
       description of the analysis used to determine required capabilities.
       4.4.6.2. A CONOPS Summary that provides the operational context for understanding
       the need and the solution tradespace. This summary should include: desired operational
       outcomes, desired effects to achieve outcomes, and an overview of how capabilities are
       envisioned to be employed and complement Joint Forces and enabling capabilities.
       4.4.6.3. A methodology/rationale for the minimum values for each gap identified in the
       ICD with reference to the key supporting analysis.
       4.4.6.4. The initial affordability assessment within the context of the appropriate
       portfolio.
       4.4.6.5. Proposed recommendation(s) to mitigate the capability gap.
       4.4.6.6. An assessment of pre-MDD analysis and determination of readiness to proceed
       with development of the AoA Study Plan.
   4.4.7. Exit Criteria. A validated ICD completes the ICD process. ICD validation should
   include 1) designation of the appropriate Lead Command (as required) and 2) approval to
   proceed in development of the AoA Study Plan, as appropriate.
4.5. AoA Documents. Following an ICD the next formal step in the process are the AoA
documents. However, before beginning an AF sponsored AoA, sufficient pre-AoA activities
need to be conducted to sufficiently refine the requirement and scope the alternatives. This is
normally conducted through DP. This is Pre-MDD early systems engineering analysis and
analysis planning. The AoA is usually conducted post-MDD during the Materiel Solution
Analysis Phase and is an analytical comparison of the operational effectiveness, suitability, risk,
and life cycle cost of alternatives that satisfy validated capability needs (usually stipulated in an
approved ICD). The AoA helps decision-makers understand the tradespace for new materiel
solutions to satisfy an operational capability need, while providing the analytic basis for
performance attributes documented in follow-on JCIDS documents. The AoA is not a source
selection where a particular materiel solution is identified, but rather refines the capabilities by
narrowing the scope of potential alternatives and helps refine the requirements. The sponsor is
responsible for executing the AoA with assistance from AFMC/OAS. Ideally, the AoA study
team evolves from the CBA and pre-MDD analysis study teams as well as the enduring HPT
membership and includes representatives from AFMC/OAS, HAF organizations, representatives
from other agencies/Services, Implementing Command , and others as needed. AoA guidance is
available in the AFMC/OAS analysis handbooks. The sponsor will notify AF/A5R before
initiating any AoA activities via a study initiation memo as prescribed in the JCIDS Manual.
Normally, a Senior Advisory Group (SAG), chaired by OSD/CAPE will oversee the execution of
 52                                                    AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


ACAT I/JROC Interest AoAs. In situations where the AoA Study Lead and/or SAG elects to
significantly revise the conditions, assumptions, mission tasks, or alternatives in the AFROC-
approved AoA Study Plan, the AF Sponsor will notify AF/A5R. In such cases, AF/A5R may
request the Sponsor provide an interim progress briefing be presented to the AFRRG/AFROC (as
required). In short, the AoA must provide clear and unambiguous data, enabling senior AF
leaders the ability to debate and assess a potential program's operational utility, affordability, and
cycle time. An AoA is required for all acquisition programs. The AoA consists of three distinct
documents, AoA Study Guidance, AoA Study Plan, and the AoA Final Report. Additional
guidance is listed below on each of these three activities.

Figure 4.3. Requirements Overview – AoA




   4.5.1. AoA Study Guidance. AoA Study Guidance and ICD are required before proceeding
   with the AoA Study Plan RSR. AoA Study Guidance is developed to address the critical

       the AoA process. A validated/sufficient AoA is required for a program to proceed to a
       MS A review (Defense Acquisition Board).
4.6. Key Performance Parameters (KPP) & Key System Attributes (KSA) Development
Guidance. KPPs and KSAs are critical in the development of an effective military capability.
Identified in the Draft CDD, CDDs and CPDs these parameters and attributes form the
requirements foundation of the proposed new materiel solution. KPPs are core performance
parameters that capture the essential functionality of the system and should represent the major
cost drivers of the program. KPPs are so critical that a failure to meet a KPP threshold brings the
 56                                                   AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


military utility of the system(s) into question and will result in a reevaluation of the program and
potentially program cancellation. KSAs are attributes or characteristics considered essential to
achieving the identified KPPs. The number of KPPs and KSAs should be kept to the minimum
necessary to properly define essential system characteristics and performance. KPP and KSA
values become more refined throughout the requirements and acquisition process as a better
understanding of the achievable solutions are developed. KPPs and KSAs must be measurable,
testable and quantifiable.
   4.6.1. KPP/KSA development. The sponsor will comply with the JCIDS Manual when
   developing KPPs/KSAs. Sponsors must be able to justify why the performance parameter or
   system attribute was selected and be able to defend the threshold values using acceptable
   analytic rigor tied to the operational risk assessment. Risk, affordability and testability must
   also be considered when developing KPPs/KSAs. If threshold values do not equal objective
   values, the sponsor must justify how the objective value provides significant increases in
   operational utility.
   4.6.2. Mandatory KPPs. The following KPPs are mandatory in requirements documents per
   the JCIDS Manual: the Force Protection KPP, the Survivability KPP, the Sustainment KPP,
   the Net-Ready KPP, the Training KPP and the Energy KPP. If one or more of these
   mandatory KPPs is not applicable, the sponsor will justify why it is not appropriate for their
   document and include the appropriate rationale in the subject document. Refer to the JCIDS
   Manual for additional guidance on Mandatory KPPs.
   4.6.3. Mandatory KSAs. The following KSA is an AF mandatory KSA in AF requirements
   documents: the Flight Simulator KSA. Sponsors will clearly define the attributes of the
   Flight Simulator KSA in measurable, testable and quantifiable terms. The KSA will have a
   threshold (minimum acceptable value) to satisfy the operational requirements. The Flight
   Simulator KSA will be part of the overarching Training KPP. If this KSA is not applicable,
   the sponsor will justify why it is not appropriate for their document and include the
   appropriate rationale in the subject document.
   4.6.4. KPP/KSA Changes. The following are the validation authorities for changes made to
   KPPs and KSAs within a previously validated JCIDS document. Validation authority is
   based on the JCIDS document’s JSD.
       4.6.4.1. JROC Interest Documents.       The JROC will validate any changes to KPPs in
       JCIDS documents having a JSD of         JROC Interest, unless the JROC has specifically
       delegated validation authority to the   AF. The AFROC must validate any change to a
       KPP before JROC submittal. For all      other changes, AF/A5R will determine the level of
       AF review.
       4.6.4.2. JCB Interest Documents. The JCB will validate any changes to KPPs in JCIDS
       documents having a JSD of JCB Interest, unless the JCB has specifically delegated
       validation authority to the AF. The AFROC must validate any change to a KPP before
       JCB submittal. For all other changes, AF/A5R will determine the level of AF review.
       4.6.4.3. Independent, Joint Information, and Joint Integration Documents. The AFROC
       will validate any changes to KPPs in JCIDS documents having a JSD of Independent,
       Joint Information, or Joint Integration. For all non-KPP changes, AF/A5R will determine
       the level of AF review and/or validation before AF approval.

4.7. Draft Capability Development Document (CDD). The Draft CDD is required for the
Milestone A acquisition decision, shapes the requirements before the Technology Development
Phase and informs the Technology Development Strategy (TDS), Requests for Proposals (RFP),
and T&E Strategy. The draft CDD outlines the minimum essential information for technology
development. Further refinement will be required for the final CDD.
   4.7.1. The Draft CDD will contain the following as a minimum:
      4.7.1.1. An Operational Context with focus on summary of the CONOPS (CDD Section
      1)
      4.7.1.2. A Program Summary with focus on the synchronization of System of Systems
      (SoS) efforts across other CDDs, CPDs, and Joint DCRs (CDD Section 4)
      4.7.1.3. Development KPPs, KSAs and additional performance attributes with focus on
      the initial/draft performance attributes resulting from the AoA or other studies/analysis
      (CDD Section 5)
      4.7.1.4. Other System Attributes with focus on attributes which require significant
      Technical Development Phase efforts (CDD section 6). The draft CDD outlines the
      minimum essential information for technology development and further refinement will
      be required for the final CDD. NOTE: Sections indicated are from the JCIDS guidance.

       cycle operations and sustainment costs (as available).
       4.7.6.5. KPPs, KSAs with supporting methodology, rationale and analysis for threshold
       (T) and objective (O). Sponsor should be able to show the supporting cost / capability
       tradespace analysis used to refine the key operational requirements for major program
       cost drivers. If the threshold value is planned to be achieved following Full Rate
       Production or a full deployment, include a testable threshold value for the Full Rate
       Production or fielding decision.
       4.7.6.6. Intelligence supportability requirements.
   4.7.7. Exit Criteria. An AFROC validated Draft CDD completes the Draft CDD process.
   Technology Development Final RFPs will not be released until CSAF/VCSAF approval of
   the Draft CDD.
4.8. Capability Development Document (CDD). A CDD outlines an affordable increment(s)
of militarily useful, logistically supportable, and technically mature capability. The CDD
contains a carefully selected minimum set of prioritized requirements (e.g., KPPs, KSAs, and
additional attributes), each of which drive cost, schedule, and risks. A validated CDD is required
before the pre-Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) review leading up to the
MS B decision and identifies the operational KPPs, KSAs, and other attributes necessary to
design and sustain the proposed system. It describes the increment and provides an outline of the
overall acquisition program strategy.

Figure 4.5. Requirements Overview – CDD




   4.8.1. Entry Criteria. An AFROC validated Draft CDD and Lead Command verification that
   Technology Development Phase activities are sufficiently matured to determine CDD
   requirements.
   4.8.2. CDD Strategy Development. The CDD strategy lays the foundation for CDD
   development and supports the EMD phase for one or more increments. The preferred
   materiel solution is based on analysis and mature technologies demonstrated before MS B.
   The sponsor applies lessons learned during the previous phases, plus any other appropriate
   risk reduction activities such as experimentation, T&E, and capability/schedule tradeoffs.
   4.8.3. RSR Guidance. An RSR is required for all AF sponsored CDDs. Refer to Paragraph
   3.4 for additional RSR guidance.
   4.8.4. CDD Annex. A CDD annex is a separate document describing unique requirements
   for a variant of the core capability captured in the parent CDD. The annex is developed to
   add capability for a specific mission not covered within the CDD (for example, a special
   operations variant of a mobility aircraft). The CDD annex will identify all applicable
   mandatory KPPs. All sections of the annex unchanged from the original CDD display the
   words “No Change” in that section. The original CDD accompanies the annex (as reference
   only) during document review. AF/A5R determines the level of review and approval
   authority required. Additional information on CDD updates is located on the AF/A5R-P
   Requirements website.
   4.8.5. HPT Guidance. An HPT is required for all AF sponsored CDDs. Refer to Paragraph
   3.5 for additional HPT guidance and membership criteria.
   4.8.6. Review & Staffing Guidance. After the CDD is developed, it is reviewed by the
   AFRRG for approval to initiate initial staffing (Reference Paragraph 5.3), validated by the
   AFROC, and approved by the CSAF (ACAT I) or VCSAF. The level of Joint review and
   validation beyond the AFROC is dependent upon the document’s JSD. See Table 5.1 for
   additional details.
 60                                                   AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


   4.8.7. Approval Criteria. The CDD will comply with the JCIDS Manual format and
   guidance. Additionally, during the AFRRG and AFROC reviews, as a minimum, the
   following items will be reviewed:
       4.8.7.1. Mission area/portfolio overview to include: threat, current versus required
       capabilities, and operational risk assessment.
       4.8.7.2. Program description - outline what gaps will be mitigated.
       4.8.7.3. CONOPS, OV-1 and key linkages to other enabling capabilities and program
       dependencies.
       4.8.7.4. Portfolio affordability review to include development, procurement and life
       cycle operations and sustainment costs.
       4.8.7.5. KPPs, KSAs with supporting methodology, rationale and analysis for threshold
       (T) and objective (O). Sponsor should be able to show the supporting cost versus
       capability tradespace analysis used to refine the key operational requirements for major
       program cost drivers. If the threshold value is not planned to be achieved until following
       Full Rate Production or full deployment, include an interim testable threshold value for
       IOT&E or initial fielding.
       4.8.7.6. Unit procurement and operations & sustainment cost goals/caps.
       4.8.7.7. Technology readiness levels and primary requirements cost drivers.
       4.8.7.8. Life-cycle cost estimate (including level and fidelity) and current funding.
       4.8.7.9. AF or JS Certifications/Endorsements.
       4.8.7.10. Intelligence supportability requirements.
       4.8.7.11. Schedule, quantities, IOC & FOC dates, program cost estimates.
   4.8.8. Exit Criteria. A validated CDD completes the CDD process.
   4.8.9. CDD Update/Revalidation. A CDD update/revalidation is required if a change to
   KPP(s) is necessary after validation, the program experiences a 10% or greater change from
   the previously stated CDD cost data, a 10% or greater change in procurement quantities from
   the previously stated CDD procurement numbers, or a 12-month or greater schedule slip of
   IOC or FOC from the previously stated CDD IOC or FOC date. Before any CDD update, the
   sponsor must contact AF/A5R-P to determine the AF level of review and approval authority.
   Proposed changes to KPPs, KSAs, and/or additional attributes must be accompanied by a
   funding strategy and schedule that have been coordinated with the appropriate program
   office. As a minimum, all changes to KPPs (regardless of ACAT) must be validated at the
   AFROC and agreed upon by VCSAF. Additional information on CDD updates is located on
   the AF/A5R-P Requirements website and the JCIDS Manual. Many AF systems have been
   developed and procured pre-JCIDS using an Operational Requirements Document (ORD).
   Requirements changes to programs developed using an ORD will normally require a new
   JCIDS document.
4.9. Capability Production Document (CPD). The CPD outlines an affordable increment of
militarily useful, logistically supportable, and technically mature capability that is ready for
production. The CPD is a refined set of prioritized requirements and identifies the production
AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                          61


KPPs, KSAs and other attributes necessary to produce and sustain the system within cost,
schedule and risk constraints. A validated and approved CPD (or revalidated CDD in lieu of
CPD) is required before MS C.

Figure 4.6. Requirements Overview – CPD




   4.9.1. Entry Criteria. A sponsor can initiate a CPD if they have an approved ICD and/or
   CDD and/or they have RSR approval to proceed with CPD development.
   4.9.2. CPD Strategy Development. The requirements strategy lays the foundation for CPD
   development and supports the Production and Deployment phase for a single increment. The
   selected materiel solution is based on analysis and mature technologies demonstrated before
   MS C. The sponsor applies lessons learned during the previous phases plus any other
   appropriate risk reduction activities such as experimentation, T&E, and capability, cost and
   schedule tradeoffs.
   4.9.3. RSR Guidance. An RSR is required for all CPDs. Refer to Paragraph 3.4 for
   additional RSR guidance.
   4.9.4. HPT Guidance. An HPT is required for all AF sponsored CPDs. Refer to Paragraph
   3.5 for additional HPT guidance and membership criteria.
   4.9.5. Review & Staffing Guidance. After the CPD is developed, it is reviewed by the
   AFRRG for approval to initiate initial staffing (Reference Paragraph 5.3), validated by the
   AFROC, and approved by the CSAF (ACAT I) or VCSAF. The level of Joint review and
   validation beyond the AFROC is dependent upon the document’s JSD. See Table 5.1 for
   additional details.
   4.9.6. Approval Criteria. The CPD will comply with the JCIDS Manual format and
   guidance. Additionally, during the AFRRG and AFROC reviews, as a minimum, the
   following items will be reviewed:
      4.9.6.1. Mission area/portfolio overview to include: threat, current versus required
      capabilities, and operational risk assessment.
62                                                  AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


     4.9.6.2. Program description - outline what gaps will be mitigated.
     4.9.6.3. CONOPS, OV-1 and key linkages to other enabling capabilities and program
     dependencies.
     4.9.6.4. Portfolio affordability review to include procurement and life cycle operations
     and sustainment costs.
     4.9.6.5. KPPs, KSAs with supporting methodology, rationale and analysis for threshold
     (T) and objective (O). Sponsor should be able to show the supporting cost versus
     capability tradespace analysis used to refine the key operational requirements for major
     program cost drivers. If the threshold value is not planned to be achieved following Full
     Rate Production or a full deployment, include an interim testable threshold value for the
     LRIP or initial fielding.
     4.9.6.6. Unit procurement and operations & sustainment cost goals/caps.
     4.9.6.7. Technology and Manufacturing readiness levels and primary requirements cost
     drivers.
     4.9.6.8. Life-cycle cost estimate (including level and fidelity) and current funding.
     4.9.6.9. Status of JS Certifications/Endorsements.
     4.9.6.10. Intelligence supportability requirements.
     4.9.6.11. Schedule, quantities, IOC & FOC dates, program cost estimates.
     4.9.6.12. Sponsor will outline any operational requirements and program changes from
     the CDD and describe the rationale that led to the change. Sponsors will also outline any
     impact to mission capability and program cost/schedule as a result of these changes.
  4.9.7. Exit Criteria. A validated CPD completes the CPD process.
  4.9.8. CDD in lieu of CPD. The CDD may be submitted in lieu of a CPD to support MS C
  acquisition decisions for each successive capability increment so long as there are no changes
  to KPPs, KSAs, other system attributes, and there are no adverse effects to previously
  validated capability requirements. When considering a CDD in lieu of CPD approach, the
  sponsor must contact AF/A5R-P and the AF/A5R Functional Division regarding its
  feasibility and receive approval to proceed. If approved, the CDD in lieu of CPD request will
  be forwarded to the AFRRG for review. In most cases, initial staffing is waived and with
  AFRRG concurrence the CDD in lieu of CPD is forwarded to the AFROC for validation,
  before submitting the document to the JS for review and validation (as required).
  4.9.9. Changes to the CPD. Unlike the CDD, the CPD is always specific to a single
  increment and is normally not updated. However, should a CPD update be required, the
  sponsor must contact AF/A5R-P for review. Proposed changes to KPPs, KSAs, and/or
  additional attributes must be accompanied by a funding strategy and schedule that have been
  coordinated with the appropriate program office. As a minimum, all changes to KPPs
  (regardless of ACAT) must be validated at the AFROC and agreed upon by VCSAF.
  Document preparation, format, review, validation, approval, and archiving of subsequent
  updates are normally the same as the original CPD. Many AF systems have been developed
  and procured pre-JCIDS using an ORD. Significant requirements changes to programs
  developed using an ORD will normally require a new JCIDS document.
AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                             63


4.10. Information Systems. AF Information Systems are usually classified either as a Major
Automated Information System (ACAT IA) or Automated Information System (ACAT III). In
rare cases, a Major Automated Information System may also rise to meet the criteria and
classification of a Major Defense Acquisition Program. For these situations, an IS-ICD will not
be used. Defense Business Systems can fall into any of the above categories. A Defense
Business System is an IS that is not part of a weapon system, or directly involved in the
fulfillment of military or intelligence missions. Defense Business Systems are not subject to
JCIDS and are not normally reviewed by the AFRRG or AFROC.
   4.10.1. IT-Box Model. The IT Box Model, as described in the JCIDS manual, provides IS
   programs greater flexibility to incorporate evolving technologies and achieve faster responses
   from requirements validation processes by calling for fewer iterations of validating
   documents through the JCIDS process.
   4.10.2. IS-ICD. IS-ICDs are used to document capability requirements and associated
   capability gaps where the intended solution approach involves research, development, and
   acquisition of applications system software, and the projected software development costs
   exceed $15M. It is not intended to be used for software embedded as a subset of a capability
   solution developed under other validated documents. All hardware associated with an IS-
   ICD is COTS/GOTS/NDI and hardware development is restricted to that necessary for
   system integration, system enhancements, and hardware refresh due to obsolescence.
   Follow-on IS-CDDs, CDDs and CPDs are not required for IS using an IS-ICD. An IS-ICD
   can be used for Automated Information Systems that exceed $15M in development costs and
   are not designated an MDAP.
       4.10.2.1. Entry Criteria. A sponsor can initiate an IS-ICD for any IS provided it meets
       the requirements listed in Paragraph 4.10.2
       4.10.2.2. IS-ICD Strategy Development. The IS-ICD requirements strategy establishes
       the path necessary to develop a quality IS-ICD that is capable of guiding future capability
       development activities. Continuous collaboration ensures the requirements strategy
       addresses required capabilities identified in the CBA and/or applicable Joint and AF
       concepts, capabilities-based planning documents and other pertinent guidance.
       4.10.2.3. RSR Guidance. An Initial RSR is required for all AF sponsored IS-ICDs.
       Refer to Paragraph 3.4. for additional RSR guidance.
       4.10.2.4. HPT Guidance. An HPT is required for all AF sponsored IS-ICDs. Refer to
       Paragraph 3.5 for additional HPT guidance and membership criteria.
       4.10.2.5. Review & Staffing Guidance. After the IS-ICD is developed, it is reviewed by
       the AFRRG for approval to initiate initial staffing (Reference Paragraph 5.3), validated
       by the AFROC, and approved by the VCSAF. The level of Joint review and validation
       beyond the AFROC is dependent upon the document’s JSD. See Table 5.1 for additional
       details.
       4.10.2.6. Approval Criteria. The IS-ICD will comply with the JCIDS Manual format and
       guidance. Additionally, during the AFRRG and AFROC reviews, as a minimum, the
       following items will be reviewed:
          4.10.2.6.1. A proposed/approved governance structure.
 64                                                AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


          4.10.2.6.2. A methodology/rationale for the minimum values for each gap identified
          in the IS-ICD with reference to the key supporting analysis.
          4.10.2.6.3. A review of costs, funding and schedule.
          4.10.2.6.4. A CONOPS Summary that provides the operational context for
          understanding the need and the solution tradespace. This summary should include:
          desired operational outcomes, effects produced to achieve outcome, intelligence
          support needs, how capability complements Joint Forces and enabling capabilities, as
          required.
          4.10.2.6.5. A description of the capability gap and the operational and/or force
          management risk of not filling the gap.
       4.10.2.7. Exit Criteria. AFROC will validate the IS-ICD and document the validation
       decision with an AFROCM. The AFROCM and IS-ICD will be archived in the IRSS
       database. The level of review, validation, and approval beyond the AFROC is dependent
       upon the document’s JSD (Table 5.1). The status of programs using IS-ICDs will
       normally be reviewed by the appropriate FCB every two years. The AFRRG and/or
       AFROC will review before FCB review.
       4.10.2.8. IS-ICD Revalidation. An IS-ICD will require AFROC revalidation in the
       following situations:
          4.10.2.8.1. If any new capability requirements need to be added beyond the scope of
          the previously validated IS-ICD.
          4.10.2.8.2. If Major Automated Information System program development and
          integration or sustainment funding increases by 10% or more than what is identified
          in the IS-ICD.
   4.10.3. IS-CDD. IS-CDDs have the same intent as an IS-ICD and are intended to be used in
   cases where a validated ICD or CDD wants to transition to the IT Box model. An IS-ICD is
   not required before initiating an IS-CDD. For purposes of this instruction an IS-CDD will be
   processed in the same manner as an IS-ICD. For additional information on the IS-CDD
   reference the JS Alternate Formats document to the JCIDS Manual.
4.11. Joint DOTmLPF-P Change Recommendation (Joint DCR). Joint DCRs are the JCIDS
approved method for documenting and validating non-materiel solutions that are used as an
alternative to, or complement of, a materiel solution. The use of a Joint DCR must have Joint
impact. AF service specific changes do not use a Joint DCR; they are captured using the AF
Change Recommendation process. Refer to Paragraph 4.12 for additional guidance on AF
DCR. Refer to the JCIDS Manual for additional guidance on Joint DCRs.
   4.11.1. Entry Criteria. In most cases an ICD(s) will be the basis for a Joint DCR request.
   However, an ICD is not required before initiating a Joint DCR request. In these situations,
   the sponsor will follow the guidance as specified in the JCIDS Manual. These requests can
   be made during any phase of the acquisition process.
   4.11.2. HPT Guidance. An HPT will be required for a Joint DCR. Contact AF/A5R-P for
   details on HPT membership and execution guidance. Refer to the AF/A5R-P website for
   additional information.
AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                           65


   4.11.3. Review & Staffing Guidance. After the Joint DCR is developed, it is reviewed by
   the AFRRG for approval to initiate AF initial staffing (Reference Paragraph 5.3), validated
   by the AFROC, approved by the VCSAF, and then is submitted for JS for validation.
   4.11.4. Approval Criteria. The Joint DCR will comply with the JCIDS Manual format and
   guidance. During the AFRRG and AFROC reviews, as a minimum, the following items will
   be reviewed: identify the purpose of the change, identify the associated benefits of the
   change (e.g. cost or manpower savings), identify any potential road-blocks (e.g. funding,
   resource or time constraints), identify any gap(s) mitigated, identify projected
   implementation costs, demonstrate approval of impacted stakeholders to include the
   functional area responsible for oversight of the DOTmLPF-P specified area(s) and identify
   the Lead HAF organization/Lead Command/CFLI.
   4.11.5. Exit Criteria. Joint DCR will be validated by the JROC and documented with a
   JROCM.
4.12. AF DOTmLPF-P Change Recommendation (AF DCR). AF DCRs document the AF
unique non-materiel solutions identified in the CBA. This is also used when a unique AF non-
materiel solution can be implemented independent of proposed materiel needs, or situations that
complement a materiel solution. These change recommendations will be implemented in
accordance with the appropriate processes for the type of non-materiel solution (e.g., training,
doctrine, policy, manpower, facilities). AF change recommendations do not go to the Joint Staff.
Table 4.1 illustrates the POCs for AF Change Recommendations.

   4.12.1. Entry Criteria. An AF Change Recommendation may be submitted at any time
   during the requirements process, when a non-materiel solution(s) has been identified as a
   more efficient or more effective means to close a capability gap. Typically, CBA results will
   be used to identify change recommendations to DOTmLPF-P.
   4.12.2. HPT Guidance. An HPT will be required for an AF DCR. Contact AF/A5R-P for
   details on HPT membership and execution guidance. Refer to the AF/A5R-P website for
   additional information.
   4.12.3. Review & Staffing Guidance. After the AF DCR is developed, it is reviewed by
   AFRRG for approval to initiate AF initial staffing (Reference Paragraph 5.3), validated by
   the AFROC, and approved by the VCSAF.
   4.12.4. Approval Criteria. The following criteria will be required for approval: the sponsor
   will identify the purpose of the change, identify the associated benefits of the change (e.g.

  cost or manpower savings), identify any potential road-blocks (e.g. funding, resource or time
  constraints) identify any gap(s) mitigated, identify projected implementation costs, and
  demonstrate approval of impacted stakeholders to include the functional area responsible for
  oversight of the DOTmLPF-P specified area(s).
  4.12.5. Exit Criteria. AFROC approval will be documented with an AFROCM and archived
  in the IRSS database.

                                           Chapter 5

                        DOCUMENT STAFFING & VALIDATION

5.1. Purpose. This chapter provides a description of the JCIDS staffing process for AF and
Non-AF documents. It identifies the staffing tools used by the AF to staff JCIDS documents. It
provides guidance on the Joint Staffing Designation, Joint Staff endorsements and certifications,
document coordination & comment resolution, and document validation and approval.
5.2. (AF) Information & Resource Support System (IRSS). IRSS is a web-based tool on the
SIPRNet AF Portal designed to facilitate processing and tasking of AF and non-AF sponsored
requirements documents. IRSS is also used for archiving AF sponsored JCIDS documents and
all associated documentation (e.g. AFROCMs, AFRRGMs). A listing of applicable agencies and
offices to be included in all AF reviews is located within IRSS.             Sponsors (via
MAJCOM/Agency POCs) will submit documents and taskings via IRSS to AF/A5R-P for HAF
Review, Joint Review, AFROC/JROC validation, and to track the history of document
development. AF/A5R-P will forward documents and tasking to appropriate Joint Staff and
HAF offices. AF/A5R-P will archive all AF sponsored operational capability requirements
documents and AoA/analysis results (up to Secret), regardless of ACAT or JSD. Detailed
information on IRSS procedures is located on the AF/A5R-P Requirements website.
5.3. Staffing Process for AF Sponsored Documents. Staffing begins when a sponsor submits
a requirements document for AFRRG review. Following AFRRG approval, AF/A5R-P will
initiate a 21 day AF review of the document via IRSS. Comments will be provided in
accordance with Paragraph 5.6 and resolved in accordance with Paragraph 5.7. Concurrent
with AF initial staffing, AF/A5R-P will submit the document(s) to the JS/J8 Gatekeeper for
initial Joint review as described in the JCIDS Manual. The Deputy Director for Requirements
(DDR), JS/J8 serves as the JS/J8 Gatekeeper. The JS/J8 Gatekeeper will designate a lead and any
supporting FCBs with responsibility for the document and formally assign a JSD to the
document. JSD designation sets the staffing path and timeline for the document, and identifies
the validation authority. Regardless of potential ACAT or validation authority, all AF sponsored
ICDs, IS-ICDs, CDDs, IS-CDDs, CPDs, and Joint DCRs will be submitted to the Joint Staff for
evaluation of joint equity and to determine the appropriate staffing process and validation
authority. The five JSDs are listed below:
   5.3.1. JROC Interest. Applied to all documents describing ACAT I/IA programs, Joint
   DCRs, and those that have a potentially significant impact on interoperability (interagency,
   allied/partner nation, coalition). Following resolution of comments these documents are
   presented to the AFROC for AF validation. After AFROC validation the documents are
   submitted for applicable endorsements and certifications and for FCB and JCB review and
   JROC approval. The JROC is the validation authority for JROC Interest documents.
   5.3.2. JCB Interest. Applied to all documents describing ACAT II and below programs that
   have a potentially significant impact on interoperability (interagency, allied/partner nation,
   coalition). JCB Interest documents go through the same review process as JROC Interest
   documents, but receive JCB approval instead of JROC approval.
   5.3.3. Joint Integration. Applied to all documents describing ACAT II and below programs,
   which require one or more joint endorsements or certifications, but are below the level of
 68                                                 AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


   JCB interest. All certifications for Joint Integration documents must be obtained before
   AFROC review and validation. AF/A5R-P will submit Joint Integration documents to the
   JS/Gatekeeper for JS endorsements and certifications. The AFROC is the validation
   authority for Joint Integration documents.
   5.3.4. Joint Information. Applied to all documents describing ACAT II and below
   programs, which do not need Joint Staff endorsements, and are below the level of JCB
   Interest. The AFROC is the validation authority for Joint Information documents.
   5.3.5. Independent. Beyond JS Gatekeeper review and JSD assignment, Independent
   documents do not undergo Joint review. These documents are validated by the AFROC.
5.4. Endorsements/Certifications. Depending on the JSD level, requirements documents
sponsors may need to secure additional endorsements/certifications during the staffing process.
Reference the JCIDS Manual for additional guidance on the endorsement/certification process.
5.5. Staffing of Non-AF-Sponsored Documents. The JS/J8 forwards all operational capability
requirements documents with a JSD of JROC Interest, JCB Interest, Joint Integration, or Joint
Information to AF/A5R-P for AF review. After coordination with the AF FCB Lead to
determine any additional staffing distribution, AF/A5R-P forwards the document via IRSS to all
HAF and MAJCOM mandatory addressees listed on the AF Staffing Distribution list for 15 day
initial staffing review. AF organizations will provide GO endorsement for any critical
comments. The AF FCB Lead is responsible for reviewing AF comments, ascertaining the need
for GO/SES sign out (i.e. critical comments) and coordinating AF position.
5.6. Document Coordination and Commenting. Lack of a response from any AF agency
tasked to review an operational capability requirements document by the designated suspense
date is considered concurrence (tasking agencies are not required to accept late comments).
Document reviewers will submit comments and identify the significance of the comment as
“critical,” “substantive,” or “administrative.” Convincing support for critical and substantive
comments will be provided in the comment matrix via IRSS.
   5.6.1. Critical. A critical comment indicates non-concurrence with the document until the
   comment is satisfactorily resolved. Critical comments should be restricted to critical issues
   regarding KPPs and KSAs, concepts of operations, violation of policies and directives, and
   other fundamental issues concerning cost, schedule or performance that would bring into
   question the rationale for the document to be approved. Any organization submitting critical
   comments must have GO/SES endorsement before submission. Documents with unresolved
   critical comments will not go to the AFROC unless approved by AF/A5R.
   5.6.2. Substantive. A substantive comment addresses a section in the document that appears
   to be, or is potentially unnecessary, incorrect, misleading, confusing, or inconsistent with
   other sections. Substantive comments do not indicate non-concurrence, but the document
   sponsor must consider all substantive comments for incorporation.
   5.6.3. Administrative. An administrative comment addresses typographical, format, or
   grammatical errors. The sponsor should consider all administrative comments.
5.7. AF Sponsor Comment Resolution. The AF/A5R-P will consolidate all comments into
two CRMs; one CRM contains comments from AF review, and the second CRM contains
comments from the Joint review. Sponsors will use the CRMs to document actions taken in
AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                            69


response to each comment. The document sponsor must show the rationale for not fully
accepting a critical or substantive comment. The sponsor resolves all critical comments before
submitting the document for AFROC review, unless otherwise approved by AF/A5R.
   5.7.1. Comment Resolution Timing. Per JS/J8 direction, the sponsor has 30 calendar days to
   adjudicate comments.
   5.7.2. Resolving Critical Comments. Resolve comments at the lowest possible level. The
   method, point of contact (POC), and date of resolution must be documented in the CRM
   (e.g., "via telephone with Maj Smith on [xx] date").
   5.7.3. Adjudication Procedures. If a critical comment cannot be resolved, the issue is
   elevated as required to achieve final resolution. The intent of the adjudication process is to
   prevent a single office or individual from holding up the document indefinitely. If the
   document sponsor cannot adjudicate the comment with the comment originator, the issue is
   raised to the O-6 level for adjudication. If the comment cannot be resolved at the O-6 level,
   the document sponsor requests AF/A5R Division Chief support in adjudicating the comment.
   AF/A5R Division Chief may present the issue to AF/A5R (as necessary). In rare instances,
   the comment may remain open and be adjudicated at the AFROC. For adjudication issues
   with other Services or the Joint Staff, the AF/A5R Functional SME assists the document
   sponsor in working the issue with the applicable FCB Working Groups and FCBs. In rare
   cases, unresolved issues may be submitted to the FCB, JCB, or JROC for resolution.
5.8. Document Validation/Approval. The MAJCOM/Agency POC submits the document for
AFROC validation, accompanied by a transmittal letter signed by the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA
Commander (CC) for potential ACAT I documents, Vice Commander (CV) for potential ACAT
II documents, or Director of Requirements for potential ACAT III documents, signifying their
approval, as illustrated in Table 5.1. Following initial staffing and comment resolution, the
document is reviewed and validated by the AFROC. AFROC decisions and recommendations
are documented in an AFROCM; signed by the AFROC Chairman. The document is approved
by the CSAF or VCSAF and is released to the Joint Staff for further Gatekeeper review and JS
staffing (FCB, JCB, and JROC, if applicable). The validation/approval phase is the formal
review process of a JCIDS requirements document to confirm capability needs and operational
requirements. The validation/approval authority for an AF requirements document is based on
its JSD (JROC Interest, JCB Interest, Joint Integration, Joint Information or Independent), as
illustrated in Table 5.1

                                           Chapter 6

                            GUIDANCE FOR MODIFICATIONS

6.1. Purpose. This chapter provides a description of the operational capability requirements
modifications process. It outlines the requirements activities required for modifications to in-
production systems fielded and managed by the AF. In-production systems are those delivered
to the government via a DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, or in the case
of software are systems that are simply approved for full deployment. For additional guidance
on modifications reference AFI 63-131.
   6.1.1. (Added-AFSPC) Refer to AFI 63-131_AFSPCSUP for specific HQ AFSPC
   modification management processes.

Figure 6.1. Requirements Overview – Modifications




6.2. Modifications. A modification is an alteration to a configuration item (CI) that, as a
minimum, changes its form, fit, function, or interface. Modifications may be installed as
permanent or temporary alterations, and may be needed to add a new temporary or permanent
capability to a fielded system or to sustain existing capability. Descriptions of each are listed
below.
   6.2.1. Temporary Modifications. Temporary modifications change the configuration of an
   item to enable short-term operational mission accomplishment, or to conduct test and
   evaluation (T&E) of new and modified equipment. When the modification is no longer
   needed, as documented in the AF Form 1067, it is removed and the CI is returned to its
   permanent configuration.
   6.2.2. Permanent Modifications. Permanent modifications change the configuration of an
   asset/software/firmware for operational effectiveness, suitability, survivability, service life
   extension and/or reduce ownership costs of a fielded weapon system, subsystem, or item.
 72                                                 AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


   6.2.3. Sustainment Modifications. Sustainment modifications are those performed to
   maintain existing capability and must show traceability to existing, validated requirements
   (ORD, CDD, CPD, etc.). Modifications that enhance or add performance do not fall in this
   category, are considered “new” requirements and require validation and approval by the
   appropriate authority.
6.3. AF Form 1067 Usage and Validation/Approval. The AF Form 1067 is the document
normally used to initiate temporary modifications and permanent sustainment modifications for
fielded systems and equipment. An AF Form 1067 can also be used to document the submission,
review and approval of requirements for permanent capability modifications estimated to cost no
more than ten percent of the minimum threshold dollar values for ACAT II programs.
   6.3.1. AF Form 1067 Approval (All Types). The Lead Command Director of Requirements
   and Program Manager for a system may approve all AF Form 1067s below $50M (total
   program cost: RDT&E + procurement in current year dollars). AF Form 1067s greater than
   $50M (total program cost: RDT&E + procurement in current year dollars) require AF/A5R
   approval after appropriate staffing across HAF. AF Form 1067s greater than $100M (total
   program cost: RDT&E + procurement in current year dollars) require AFROC validation and
   VCSAF approval as appropriate. See Table 6.1 for additional guidance.
   6.3.2. Permanent Modifications (New Capability). Modifications that introduce new
   capability and are estimated to cost no more than ten percent of the minimum threshold
   dollar values for ACAT II programs, as described in DoDI 5000.02, may use an AF Form
   1067. Sponsors will include a Table of Performance Parameters/Attributes (KPP, KSA,
   other or attributes) with minimum Threshold/Objective values similar to the format for a
   CDD/CPD. If estimated expenditures exceed ten percent of ACAT II minimum threshold
   dollar values, an AF Form 1067 may not be used for modifications that introduce new
   capability; in this case, the sponsor will prepare a new JCIDS requirement document for
   review and validation. See Table 6.1 for additional guidance.
       6.3.2.1. (Added-AFSPC) NOTE: Modifications               are    considered     “Capability
       modifications” only if the intent of the modification is to change the validated
       requirements (CDD, ORD, etc.) for the weapon system. An incidental increase in
       performance due to modernized equipment/components used to sustain the system is not
       a capability modification if the basic operational requirement has not changed.

   6.3.3. (Added-AFSPC) The following procedures, in concert with those specified in AFI
   63-131 and AFSPC Supplement, apply for review and approval of AF Form 1067 within HQ
   AFSPC. NOTE: This process is for review and approval only; it does not alter the basic
   process for generating the modification proposal or the technical analysis required IAW AFI
   63-131.
      6.3.3.1. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/A4S notifies HQ AFSPC/A5X of scheduled
      CRB.HQ AFSPC/A4C notifies HQ AFSPC/A5J of scheduled VCB (for cyber-related
      modifications). and the HQ AFSPC/A4 Division forwards the AF Form1067(s) for
      review. HQ AFSPC/A5X/A5J ensures SMEs from the pertinent HQ AFSPC/A5 Division
      will attend to address the modification subject matter.
      6.3.3.2. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/A5X (CRB)/A5J (VCB) and Division SME(s)
      will attend CRB/VCB.
      6.3.3.3. (Added-AFSPC) When Part IV, SINGLE MANAGER REVIEW AND
      APPROVAL, is complete, and after CRB/VCB review, A5 Division SME will forward to
      the appropriate A5 Division Chief for approval if expected expenditure consists of
      RDT&E and procurement (3600, 3080) appropriations. NOTE: This applies to all (T-1,
      T-2, permanent) modifications. If funding is 3400 (O&M) only, approval is as directed
      by the CRB/VCB.
          6.3.3.3.1. (Added-AFSPC) Part            V,         LEAD             COMMAND
          CERTIFICATION/APPROVAL, is delegated to the pertinent A5 Division Chief if
          the total expected expenditure of RDT&E and procurement appropriations is < $50M.

           6.3.3.3.2. (Added-AFSPC) If expected expenditure of RDT&E and procurement
           exceeds $50M, Division Chief will forward AF Form 1067 to A5 for endorsement to
           forward to HAF/A5R IAW this AFI.
           6.3.3.3.3. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/A5             will   indicate   Lead   Command
           recommendation in a memo to HAF/A5R.
           6.3.3.3.4. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/A5 Division Chief will provide briefing
           materials and presentation for AFRRG consideration with HQ AFSPC/A4 Division
           Chief support.
           6.3.3.3.5. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/A5 Division Chief will prepare A5 for in-
           person AFROC presentation; if AFROC is via VTC, the Division Chief will present
           briefing for AFROC consideration.
6.4. Net-Ready Key Performance Parameters (NR KPP). The JS/J6 DDC4 must approve
permanent modifications that require interoperability and supportability certification (normally
addressed as the NR KPP in operational capability documents). For modifications that meet AF
Form 1067 criteria, the sponsor prepares an AF Form 1067 while the program manager, with the
sponsor’s support, updates the system’s information support plan (ISP). The sponsor submits the
updated ISP to JS/J6 to obtain certification. The modification may not be installed until the
interoperability and supportability certification is granted by JS/J6.
   6.4.1. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/A5 RL, with A3 Weapon System Lead advocacy,
   prepares an AF Form 1067 or legacy systems that require NR-KPP and
   Interoperability/Supportability Certifications. The AF Form 1067 shall not obtain Part III
   signature until the ISP is approved. The ISP review and approval process is as follows. HQ
   AFSPC/A5 and HQ AFSPC/A3 (as appropriate) will assist the PM in updating or initiating
   the system’s Information Support Plan (ISP) using the GIG Technical Guidance – Federation
   (GTG-F) Enhanced ISP (EISP) Wizard. HQ AFSPC/A5 and the Program Manager shall
   create or update required DoDAF integrated architecture views and the NR-KPP table
   derived from the integrated architecture views IAW the JCIDS Manual Guide for the Net-
   Ready KPP. All architecture products must be reviewed by the HQ AFSPC Architecture
   Synchronization Forum (ASF) and approved by the HQ AFSPC/A5 as Chief Architect. The
   RL and PM shall coordinate as early as possible with the ASF to ensure timely review is
   attained. Upon Chief Architect approval, the HQ AFSPC/A5 Sponsor will assist the Program
   Manager to insert/update the system’s NR-KPP table and the approved DoD AF integrated
   architecture views into the ISP. It is the responsibility of the PM to input the ISP into the
   GTG-F system to initiate the formal/final ISP review process within GTG-F. HQ
   AFSPC/A6X, as lead assessor for AFSPC, will task AFSPC directorates and AFNIC to
   review the ISP IAW ISP review process in DoDI 4630.08, Procedures for Interoperability
   and Supportability of Information Technology and National Security Systems. Once review
   is complete, HQ AFSPC/A6XR provides the consolidated AFSPC response to the ISP within
   the GTG-F. Simultaneously, HQ AFSPC/A5X will initiate AF approval and certification
   IAW AFI 33-401. The AF Form 1067 will include a URL location of the new or updated
   ISP; the ISP (not the AF Form 1067) undergoes review by Joint Staff/J6. The NR-KPP
   (includes Interoperability & Supportability) capability modification to the legacy system may
   not be installed (post CDR activity) until the NR-KPP and interoperability and supportability
   certifications are granted.

                    URGENT / EMERGENT OPERATIONAL NEEDS

7.1. Purpose. This chapter provides a description of the Urgent Operational Needs
(UONs)/Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONs)/Joint Emergent Operational Needs (JEONs)
process. See the JCIDS Manual for additional information on UONs/JUONs/JEONs.
7.2. Specific UON/JUON/JEON Organizational Responsibilities. All organizations listed
below will identify an OPR for processing and tracking all AF UONs/JUONs/JEONs related to
their organization. In addition, they have the following responsibilities:
   7.2.1. AF/A5R is the single HAF POC for operational capability requirements activities
   associated with this process.
   7.2.2. SAF/AQX is the single HAF POC for acquisition activities associated with this
   process. This includes determination of an appropriate acquisition strategy in accordance
   with the Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) process as described in AFI 63-114.
   7.2.3. Air Combat Command (ACC) is the Lead Command for UONs/JUONs/JEONs
   associated with air combat capabilities, integrated ISR capabilities, combat search and
   rescue, command and control, and combat support capabilities.
   7.2.4. Air Mobility Command (AMC) is the Lead Command for UONs/JUONs/JEONs
   associated with air mobility capabilities.
   7.2.5. Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) is Lead Command for
   UONs/JUONs/JEONs associated with special operations capabilities.
   7.2.6. Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) is Lead Command for UONs/JUONs/JEONs
   associated with space and cyberspace-related capabilities.
   7.2.7. Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) is the Lead Command for
   UONs/JUONs/JEONs/QRCs associated with nuclear and global strike capabilities.
   7.2.8. Implementing commands, AFSPC and AFMC, will assist the Lead Command in
   identifying potential solutions, developing the acquisition strategy, and test and evaluation
   strategy.
7.3. AFROC Responsibilities for Urgent/Emergent Needs. The AFROC has two decision-
making responsibilities for Urgent/Emergent Needs in the Quick Reaction Capability process.
First, the AFROC is responsible for validating all UON requests. Second, the AFROC is
responsible for providing an AF Corporate Review, through a Capabilities Transition Decision
(CTD), for all UON/JUON/JEON fielded capabilities. See Figure 7.1 for additional information
on Urgent/Emergent Needs.
 76                                                  AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


Figure 7.1. Urgent/Emergent Needs in the Quick Reaction Capability Process




7.4. Urgent Operational Needs (UONs). UONs identify Service specific needs during a
current conflict or crisis situation that if not satisfied in an expedited manner, will result in
unacceptable loss of life or critical mission failure. The goal of the UON process is to deliver
fielded capability within 180 days of a validated request. The UON is not intended to be used
for acquisition development activities, requesting non-materiel solutions or force deployments;
however, it may identify a non-materiel approach as the most effective solution.
   7.4.1. UON Submission Criteria. Organizations submitting or endorsing a UON must ensure
   the following criteria are met:
       7.4.1.1. The urgent need has identified a capability gap or shortfall that will result in
       imminent loss of life and/or result in critical mission failure during an ongoing/current
       conflict or crisis situation.
       7.4.1.2. The urgent need solution should be capable of being fielded within a 180 days of
       a validated request. A UON request will not be held up in cases where this is unable to
       be determined at the time of validation.
       7.4.1.3. The UON origination and submission must come from an AF Component
       Commander.
   7.4.2. UON Submission Process.
       7.4.2.1. UON Format. A recommended format for submission of a UON is provided at
       Attachment 2. The warfighter is encouraged to provide as much information as possible.
       7.4.2.2. Early Notification. To facilitate mutual understanding of the need and
       expeditious identification of a satisfactory solution, warfighters are encouraged to contact
       Lead Command, AF/A5R and SAF/AQX as early as possible if a UON submission is
       being considered.
       7.4.2.3. UON Validation Recommendation. Initial UON notification will include
       AF/A5R-P, SAF/AQX and the Lead Command. Upon notification of a UON AF/A5R-P,
AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                          77


     SAF/AQX and the Lead Command will review the UON request to ensure the right
     MAJCOM has been identified as the Lead Command. The Lead Command will begin
     developing a validation recommendation for AFROC validation.
         7.4.2.3.1. The Lead Command will consider the basic solution options, ROM costs,
         intelligence support needs and schedule and develop a proposed COA (to include
         options from the special programs community). Additionally, the Lead Command
         will evaluate impacts on the platform(s), impacts on operational mission(s), and any
         impacts on modernization program(s). Based on this information, the AFROC will
         either validate or reject the UON with a goal 14-21 days of receipt of the UON
         request, normally via e-AFROC.
         7.4.2.3.2. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/A5X is the entry point for UONs to HQ
         AFSPC. When a UON is received, HQ AFSPC/A5X will convene an AO-level
         working group (to include the prospective program office) to assign an OPR and
         consider the UON for an initial validation recommendation. HQ AFSPC/A5X will
         then:
             7.4.2.3.2.1. (Added-AFSPC) Schedule and facilitate a short notice meeting with
             HQ AFSPC/A5 to relay the initial validation recommendation.
             7.4.2.3.2.2. (Added-AFSPC) Convene an out-of cycle Requirements Board to
             approve/disapprove the recommendation.
             7.4.2.3.2.3. (Added-AFSPC) Forward    the   UON    and    HQ     AFSPC
             recommendation for validation to AF/A5R-P and SAF/AQX (if not previously
             forwarded by the submitter).
             7.4.2.3.2.4. (Added-AFSPC) Facilitate processing of the UON, along with the
             designated OPR through the AFROC process described below.
             7.4.2.3.2.5. (Added-AFSPC) Gather and provide monthly AFSPC UON status
             to the AFROC.
  7.4.3. UON Validation. The Lead Command is responsible for developing a validation
  position for presentation to the AFROC. Validation is based on positively meeting the
  following three criteria: 1) requested need is in support of an ongoing/current conflict or
  crisis situation 2) failure to meet the need will result in imminent loss of life or critical
  mission failure 3) an acceptable solution can be fielded within 2 years of validation. A
  “Negative” response to any of these criteria will result in a MAJCOM recommendation to not
  validate the UON request.
     7.4.3.1. If the AFROC validates the UON and the VCSAF approves, the UON is
     transitioned to SAF/AQX for assignment to a SAF/AQ Capability Directorate. A
     Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) will be appointed by the Capability Director. The
     Lead Command will load the UON request into the IRSS database.
         7.4.3.1.1. Once the Lead Command has finalized the COA and the MDA has
         approved the COA, the COA selection will be reviewed by AF/A5R as a final
         requirements evaluation review before development and fielding.
     7.4.3.2. If the request is not validated, the Lead Command will engage with the sponsor
     to see if descoping the requirements is a possibility. If this is not an option, the VCSAF
 78                                                AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


       will sign and send the AFROCM back to the AF component requesting the UON stating
       the reason why the UON was disapproved.
   7.4.4. UON Revalidation. UON validations expire two years after the date of validation. If
   initial fielding has not been initiated at two years from the validation date, the Lead
   Command will determine from the requestor if the desired capability is still needed.
       7.4.4.1. If the capability is still an Urgent Need, the Lead Command will request the
       AFROC to revalidate the UON. AF/A5R-P will notify SAF/AQX workflow of the
       revalidation decision. Courtesy copies will be provided to AFMC/A5C workflow and
       AFSPC/A5X workflow.
       7.4.4.2. If the capability is no longer needed, the Lead Command will recommend
       termination of the UON to the AFROC.
7.5. Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONs). A JUON is an urgent need identified by a
warfighting commander that requires synchronization across multiple Service/agency providers
to ensure complete and timely combat capability is provided to the Joint warfighter. JUONs are
submitted to the Joint Staff J-8 under the guidance of the JCIDS Manual. JUONs will be
processed in the same manner as UONs with the exception of staffing and validation.
   7.5.1. JUON Staffing. The AF FCB Lead is the AF interface with the Joint Staff on JUON
   issues and initiates JUON staffing actions.
       7.5.1.1. When a JUON has been submitted for Joint Staff triage, the AF FCB Lead will
       notify AF/A5R-P, appropriate AF/A5R Division, SAF/AQX and other AF stakeholders
       as appropriate.
       7.5.1.2. AF FCB Lead consolidates the AF response to Joint Staff triage questions,
       determines AF equity, and drafts proposed AF position for AF/A5R(J).
       7.5.1.3. AF/A5R(J), or designated representative, transmits approved AF JUON position
       to the appropriate JS FCB Chair.
   7.5.2. JUON Validation. JS J-8/DDR is the validation authority for JUONs.
       7.5.2.1. AF FCB Lead notifies AF/A5R-P, appropriate AF/A5R Division, and
       AF/A5R(J) of Joint Staff validation decision. If JUON will potentially be assigned to
       AF, AF/A5R-P will notify SAF/AQX. If not assigned to AF, no further action required.
       7.5.2.2. If JUON is assigned to the AF, SAF/AQX, in coordination with AF/A5R, will
       assign the JUON to a Lead Command. The Lead Command, in coordination with
       CCMD, AF Component, Implementing Command, AF/A5R, SAF/AQX and HAF Staff
       will develop a proposed COA to best address the JUON requirement within available
       cost, schedule, performance and quantities. The Lead Command should ensure that the
       special programs community is part of this coordination effort so that all possible COAs
       are evaluated.
       7.5.2.3. AF/A5R Division POC will stay connected to Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell
       (JRAC), lead command, and SAF/AQX as possible COAs are developed. A JUON
       description and status will be added to IRSS.
   7.5.3. JUON Termination Procedures.
AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                              79


       7.5.3.1. Once the JUON solution has been fielded and the Military Utility Assessment
       (MUA) has been accomplished, the Lead Command will send a JUON CTD request to
       AF/A5R-P. See Paragraph 7.7 for additional information on CTD briefs.
7.6. Joint Emergent Operational Needs (JEONs). A JEON is an emergent need driven by
anticipated contingency operations that require synchronization across multiple Service/agencies.
Development and fielding timelines are longer than UONs/JUONs with expected initial fielding
occurring up to five years after validation. JEONs are submitted to the Joint Staff J-8 under the
guidance of the JCIDS Manual. AF review of JEONs will be processed in the same manner as
JUONs. The AF FCB Lead will staff the official AF JEON position to the JS for action.
7.7. Capability Transition Decision. Once the UON/JUON/JEON solution has been initially
fielded and an operational assessment completed, the Lead Command will prepare a CTD
recommendation to the AFROC. The CTD brief is an assessment of how the solution met the
requirement and a recommendation of future utilization of the fielded solution. Lead Commands
should begin planning as early as possible for the ultimate disposition of UON/JUON/JEON
solutions, and include appropriate CFLI in the planning. See the AF/A5R-P website for
additional CTD information.
   7.7.1. Solution Assessment. Based on the assessment of operational utility, conducted
   within 90 days of initial fielding, the Lead Command will recommend one of the following
   JCIDS assessments:
       7.7.1.1. Failure/Limited Success. If the solution failed or had limited success, the Lead
       Command will verify with the AF Component that the requirement remains valid. If the
       requirement remains valid, the AFROC will recommend further development of the
       original solution or another solution be pursued. If the requirement is no longer valid, the
       AFROC will terminate the UON. There are no JCIDS documents required.
       7.7.1.2. Success/ Limited Duration Requirement. If the solution was a success in theater,
       but is limited in operational effectiveness in additional theaters, the AFROC will
       recommend that the original solution be maintained In-Theater for the duration of the
       conflict or until no longer required. There are no JCIDS documents required.
       7.7.1.3. Success/Enduring Requirement. If the solution was a success, analysis shows the
       solution is required in other theaters of operation, it is not intended to be modified from
       its original configuration and it is financially viable for long-term sustainment the
       AFROC will recommend that the original solution become an enduring requirement. The
       Lead Command will document the requirement with an AF Form 1067 or CPD.
       However, if the solution needs to be modified to facilitate long-term operational
       capability and/or sustainment the AFROC will recommend that the original solution be
       sustained until replaced by a follow-on capability. The Lead Command will initiate
       development of either an AF Form 1067 or CDD as appropriate.
   7.7.2. CTD Briefing Information. Based on the recommended solution assessment the
   following information is required for CTD briefings:
       7.7.2.1. UON/JUON/JEON Background Information. Identify the capability gap,
       summarize the requested capability outlined in the UON/JUON/JEON, and the
       operational or force management risk of not transitioning the capability. Also identify
80                                                 AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


     the sponsor, validation date, capability fielded and fielding date.      (Required for all
     recommendations.)
     7.7.2.2. Provide Assessment of Fielded Capability (MUA Results). Identify the
     capability assessment period and who conducted the assessment. The assessment shall
     include a brief description of how the assessment was conducted and provide AF
     component/CCMD concurrence that UON/JUON/JEON requirement was, or was not
     fully met. (Required for all recommendations.)
     7.7.2.3. Provide a risk assessment for the solution. Assessment should detail how well
     the solution mitigates the capability gap and the impact of not sustaining the solution.
     (Required for all recommendations.)
     7.7.2.4. Provide Analysis & Traceability to Support Enduring Requirement. Identify
     Operations Plans, Contingency Plans that require gap capability, identify potential future
     theaters where solution could be used (is this gap valid outside the current AoR), provide
     draft KPPs and KSAs. (Required for enduring capability recommendations.)
     7.7.2.5. Provide analysis that supports the fielded solution is the preferred solution (i.e.
     provides the desired requirement and is affordable). If the solution is not the preferred
     solution provide other recommended alternatives to initiate an AoA at the MDA’s
     direction. (Required for enduring capability recommendations.)
     7.7.2.6. Provide cost estimates for sustainment and projected life cycle costs, to include
     integration impacts to other systems and architectures. (Required for enduring capability
     recommendations.)
     7.7.2.7. Provide an assessment of how the capability does/does not support the CFMP
     vision and force structure requirements. CFLI assessment of where the capability fits
     into their CFMP. Take into account the CCMD IPL assessments. (Required for enduring
     capability recommendations.)
7.8. UON/JUON/JEON Tracking.
  7.8.1. MAJCOMs will provide updated UON/JUON/JEON status monthly to the AFROC
  (unless delegated to the AFRRG by AF/A5R) and maintain current UON/JUON/JEON
  records in the IRSS database. For UON/JUON/JEON with SAP involvement, MAJCOMs, in
  coordination with AF/A5R-P Special Projects Branch, will ensure current UON/JUON/JEON
  status is maintained on the appropriate AFROC Special Session network.
  7.8.2. AF/A5R-P will monitor UON/JUON/JEON status through the IRSS database.
AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                          81

Terms
NOTE:—The purpose of this glossary is to help the reader understand the terms listed as used in
this publication. It is not intended to encompass all terms. See pertinent Joint and AF specific
publications for standardized terms and definitions for DoD and AF use.
Acquisition Category (ACAT)— Categories established to facilitate decentralized decision
making and execution, and compliance with statutorily imposed requirements. The categories
determine the level of review, decision authority, and applicable procedures. See DoDI 5000.02
for additional ACAT information.
Additional Attribute— A characteristic so significant it must be verified by testing or analysis.
Whenever possible, attributes should be stated in terms that reflect the capabilities necessary to
operate in the full range of military operations and the environment intended for the system,
family of systems (FoS), or system of systems (SoS). Additional attributes must be measurable,
testable, and quantifiable, and require AF/A5R approval (or delegate) to change.
Affordability— The degree to which the life-cycle cost of an acquisition program is in
consonance with the long-range modernization, force structure, and manpower plans of the
individual DoD Components (military departments and defense agencies), as well as for the
Department as a whole. For major defense acquisition programs, affordability assessments are
required at Milestones B and C. The purpose of the assessment is for the DoD Component to
 90                                                      AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


demonstrate that the programs projected funding and manpower requirements are realistic and
achievable, in the context of the DoD Component's overall long-range modernization plan.
Affordability constraints force prioritization of requirements, drive performance and cost trades,
and ensure that unaffordable programs do not enter the acquisition process. If affordability caps
are breached, costs must be reduced or else program cancelation can be expected. Constraints
stem from long-term affordability planning and analysis, which is a Component leadership
responsibility that should involve the Component’s programming, resource planning,
requirements, and acquisition communities. Affordability is reviewed during AFRRG and
AFROC reviews.
AF Form 1067 Modification Proposal— An AF Form 1067 documents the submission, review,
and approval of requirements for modifications to fielded AF systems.
AF Gatekeeper— The AFGK reviews any previous requirements documentation, updated
requirements documentation, and any additional required requirements materials intended to be
presented for AFRRG or AFROC review. The AFGK also conducts follow-on RSRs and
determines HPT membership and format (i.e. live or virtual) for the AoA Study Plan, Draft
CDDs, CDDs and CPDs.
Analysis of Alternatives (AoA)— The AoA is an analytical comparison of the operational
effectiveness, suitability, risk, and life cycle cost of alternatives that satisfy established capability
needs stipulated in an approved ICD. The AoA helps decision makers select courses of action
(COA) to satisfy an operational capability need.
Architecture— (1) The fundamental organization of a system embodied in its components, their
relationships to each other, and to the environment, and the principals guiding its design and
evolution. [IEEE STD 1471-2000]. (2) The structure of components, their relationships and the
principals and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time [Federal Enterprise
Architecture.]
Capabilities-Based Assessment (CBA)— The CBA is the Joint Capabilities Integration and
Development System analysis process. It answers several key questions for the validation
authority before their approval: define the mission; identify capabilities required; determine the
attributes/standards of the capabilities; identify gaps/shortfalls; assess operational risk associated
with the gaps/shortfalls; prioritize the gaps/shortfalls; identify and assess potential non-materiel
solutions; provide recommendations for addressing the gaps/shortfalls.
Capability— The ability to achieve a desired effect under specified standards and conditions
through combinations of means and ways across the doctrine, organization, training, materiel,
leadership and education, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTmLPF-P) to perform a set of
tasks to execute a specified course of action.
Capability Development Document (CDD)— A document that captures the information
necessary to develop a proposed program(s), normally using an evolutionary acquisition strategy.
The CDD outlines an affordable increment of militarily useful, logistically supportable, and
technically mature capability. The CDD may define multiple increments if there is sufficient
definition of the performance attributes (KPPs, KSAs, and other attributes) to allow approval of
multiple increments.
AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                             91


Capability Gaps— The inability to execute a specified course of action. The gap may be the
result of no existing capability, lack of proficiency or sufficiency in an existing capability
solution, or the need to replace an existing capability solution to prevent a future gap.
Capability Production Document (CPD)— A document that addresses the production elements
specific to a single increment of an acquisition program. The CPD defines an increment of
militarily useful, logistically supportable, and technically mature capability that is ready for a
production decision. The CPD defines a single increment of the performance attributes (KPPs,
KSAs, and other attributes) to support a MS C decision.
Capability Requirement (or Requirement)— A capability which is required to meet an
organization’s roles, functions, and missions in current or future operations. To the greatest
extent possible, capability requirements are described in relation to tasks, standards and
conditions in accordance with the Universal Joint Task List or equivalent DoD Component Task
List. If a capability requirement is not satisfied by a capability solution, then there is also an
associated capability gap which carries a certain amount of risk until eliminated. A requirement
is considered to be ‘draft’ or ‘proposed’ until validated by the appropriate authority.
Capability Shortfall— See Capability Gap.
Capability Solution— A materiel solution or non-materiel solution to satisfy one or more
capability requirements (or needs) and reduce or eliminate one or more capability gaps.
CBRN Mission Critical— A mission-critical system with operational concepts requiring
employment and survivability in chemical, biological, radiological and/or nuclear (including
electromagnetic pulse) environments.
Certification— A statement of adequacy provided by a responsible agency for a specific area of
concern in support of the validation process.
Combatant Commander— A commander of one of the unified or specified combatant
commands established by the President.
Concept— A visualization of future operations; describes how a force, using military art and
science, might employ capabilities necessary to meet future military challenges. Links strategic
guidance, planning process and plans to the development and employment of future Air Force
capabilities. Concepts serve as "engines for transformation" that may ultimately lead to doctrine,
organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities (DOTMLPF)
and policy changes.
Concept Characterization and Technical Description (CCTD)— The CCTD captures
essential information about a prospective materiel approach to address an identified capability
need. CCTD preparation begins when the capabilities-based planning process determines that a
materiel approach may be necessary to address an identified gap. Information in the CCTD can
assist in early decisions associated with narrowing down the analytical trade space of materiel
solutions, and provides the initial technical baseline upon which subsequent analyses and
documents are built. Guidance on CCTD development is available from SAF/AQR.
Concept of Operations (CONOPS)— A verbal or graphic statement, in broad outline, of a
commander’s assumptions or intent in regard to an operation or series of operations. The
CONOPS frequently is embodied in campaign plans and operation plans; in the latter case,
particularly when the plans cover a series of connected operations to be carried out
 92                                                   AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


simultaneously or in succession. The concept is designed to give an overall picture of the
operation. It is included primarily for additional clarity of purpose (also called a commander’s
concept).
Configuration Item— A configuration item is hardware, firmware or software component , or a
combination thereof, which satisfies an end use function and is designated for separate
configuration management. Hardware Configuration Items are typically referred to by an
alphanumeric identifier, while Software Configuration Items are typically assigned a computer
program identification number.
Course of Action (COA)— The COA is a planning and decision process that culminates in a
sponsor decision. It principally refers to the decision to proceed or not proceed with development
of one or more prospective materiel solutions as informed by an AoA. The COA includes a
series of alternative program choices developed by the MDA or designate, presented to a sponsor
and that once a specific COA is selected, becomes a formal agreement between the MDA and the
operator (usually Lead Command Commander) that clearly articulates the performance,
schedule, and life cycle cost expectations of the program. The COA provides the basis for the
Technology Development Strategy during the Technology Development phase.
Defense Business System— The term "defense business system" means an information system,
other than a national security system, operated by, for, or on behalf of the Department of
Defense, including financial systems, mixed systems, financial data feeder systems, and
information technology and information assurance infrastructure, used to support business
activities, such as acquisition, financial management, logistics, strategic planning and budgeting,
installations and environment, and human resource management.
DD Form 250— The DD Form 250 (Material Inspection and Receiving Report) is a
multipurpose report used: (1) provide evidence of acceptance at origin/destination; (2) to
provide evidence of Government contract quality assurance at origin/destination; (3) for supply
packing list(s); (4) for document shipping/receiving; (5) as a contractor invoice; and (6)
commercial invoice support.
Development Planning (DP)— Development Planning (DP) encompasses the engineering
analysis and technical planning activities that provide the foundation for informed investment
decisions on the fundamental path a materiel development will follow to effectively and
affordably meet operational needs.
DoD 5000 Series— DOD 5000 series refers collectively to DODD 5000.01, DODI 5000.02.,
The Defense Acquisition Guide (DAG), and other relevant DoD 5XXX publications.
DoD Components— The DoD components consist of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the
Military Departments, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the combatant commands, the
Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, the Defense Agencies, DoD Field
Activities, and all other organizational entities within the Department of Defense.
Environment— Air, space, water, land, weather, living things, built infrastructure, cultural
resources, and the interrelationships that exist among them.
Experimentation— An iterative process from developing and assessing concept-based
hypotheses to identify and recommend the best value-added solutions for changes in doctrine,
AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                              93


organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel and facilities and policy
required to achieve significant advances in future joint operational capabilities.
Experiment— A process to explore the effects of manipulating a variable; an analytical activity
to determine the efficiency of something previously untried, examine the validity of a
hypothesis, or demonstrate a known or believed truth within a specific context.
Evolutionary Acquisition (EA)— Evolutionary acquisition is the preferred DoD strategy for
rapid acquisition of mature technology for the sponsor. An evolutionary approach delivers
capability in increments, recognizing, up-front, the need for a future capability improvements.
The objective is to balance needs and available capability with resources, and to put capability
into the hands of the warfighter quickly.
Feasible— A requirement that is technically achievable and executable within the estimated
schedule and budgeted life cycle cost.
Flagship Capability Concept— An integrated technology project collaboratively developed by
MAJCOM(s), Center(s), and AFRL that: addresses a documented and prioritized MAJCOM
capability need, is commissioned via AF S&T Governance structure, and is linked to a Service
Core Function Master Plan.
Full Operational Capability— Full attainment of the capability to effectively employ a
weapon, item of equipment or system of approved specific characteristics, which is manned and
operated by a trained, equipped and supported military force or unit. The specifics for any
particular system FOC are defined in that system's Capability Development Document and
Capability Production Document.
Functional Capabilities Board (FCB)— A permanently established body that is responsible for
the organization, analysis, and prioritization of Joint warfighting capabilities within an assigned
functional area.
Human Systems Integration (HSI)— Includes the integrated and comprehensive analysis,
design and assessment of requirements, concepts and resources for system manpower, personnel,
training, environment, safety, occupational health, habitability, survivability, and human factors
engineering.
Implementing Command— The command (usually Air Force Materiel Command or Air Force
Space Command) providing the majority of personnel in direct support of the program manager
responsible for development, production, and sustainment activities.
Increment— A militarily useful and supportable operational capability that can be effectively
developed, produced or acquired, deployed, and sustained. Each increment of capability will
have its own set of threshold and objective values set by the sponsor. Technology is developed
to a desired maturity and injected into the delivery of an increment of capability.
Information & Resource Support System (IRSS)— IRSS is web-based AF-wide automated
system that provides the requirements community the ability to develop, coordinate, task, track,
and store all operational capability requirements documents (i.e., ICDs, CDDs, CPDs), along
with their associated analysis and briefings, within the AF requirements process. IRSS resides
on the AF SIPRNET Portal.
 94                                                    AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


Information Support Plan (ISP)— The identification and documentation of information needs,
infrastructure support, IT and NSS interface requirements and dependencies focusing on net-
centric, interoperability, supportability, and sufficiency concerns.
Information System (IS)— As defined by CJCSI 6212.01, is any equipment, or interconnected
system or subsystem of equipment, that is used in the automatic acquisition, storage,
manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission or
reception of data or information, and includes computers and computer networks, ancillary
equipment, software, firmware and similar procedures, services (including support services) and
related resources. Notwithstanding the above, the term information technology (IT) does not
include any equipment that is acquired by a federal contractor incidental to a federal contract.
The term information systems is used synonymously with IT (to include National Security
Systems)
Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)— Summarizes the CBA and recommends a materiel
approach or a combination of materiel and non-materiel approaches to satisfy specific capability
gaps/shortfalls. It defines the capability gap(s) in terms of the functional area, the relevant range
of military operations, desired effects, time, and DOTmLPF-P and policy implications and
constraints. The ICD summarizes the results of the DOTmLPF-P analysis and the DOTmLPF-P
approaches (materiel and non-materiel) that may deliver the required capability. The outcome of
an ICD could be one or more Joint DOTmLPF-P change recommendations or CDDs and/or
CPDs.
Initial Operational Capability (IOC)— That first attainment of the capability to employ
effectively a weapon, item of equipment, or system of approved specific characteristics with the
appropriate number, type, and mix of trained and equipped personnel necessary to operate,
maintain, and support the system. It is normally defined in the CDD. NOTE: IOC is event-
driven and not tied to a specific future date.
Intelligence Mission Data (IMD)— DoD intelligence used for programming platform mission
systems in development, testing, operations, and sustainment including, but not limited to, the
functional areas of signatures, Electronic Warfare Integrated Reprogramming Collection and
Processing, and Geospatial Intelligence.
Intelligence-Sensitive— Any program/initiative that consumes, processes or produces
intelligence information, thereby requiring threat or intelligence infrastructure support, and
which will be measured and evaluated by a program or project office in terms of cost,
performance, and impact on warfighter capabilities and fielding, shall be considered intelligence-
sensitive. If it is likely that, in the future, the program/initiative would produce, consume,
process, or handle intelligence information, then it should be considered intelligence-sensitive.
Intelligence Support— The totality of resources needed to ensure effective operation of a
system once operational from an intelligence perspective. This includes intelligence people,
products, processes, systems, training, and/or facilities.
Interoperability— The ability of systems, units, or forces to provide data, information, materiel,
and services to and accept the same from other systems, units, or forces and to use the data,
information, materiel, and services so exchanged to enable them to operate effectively together.
IT and NSS interoperability includes both the technical exchange of information and the end-to-
end operational effectiveness of that exchange of information as required for mission
AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                             95


accomplishment. Interoperability is more than just information exchange. It includes systems,
processes, procedures, organizations and missions over the life cycle and must be balanced with
information assurance.
Joint Capability Area (JCA)— Collections of like DOD capabilities functionally grouped to
support capability analysis, strategy development, investment decision making, capability
portfolio management, and operational force development and operational planning. See CJCSI
3170.01 for additional information.
Joint Capabilities Board (JCB)— The JCB functions to assist the Joint Requirements
Oversight Council (JROC) in carrying out its duties and responsibilities. The JCB reviews and,
if appropriate, endorses all operational capability requirements and Joint DOTmLPF-P change
recommendation documents before their submission to the JROC. The JCB is chaired by the
Joint Staff Director of Force Structure, Resources and Assessment (JS/J8). It is comprised of
general and flag officer representatives of the Services.
Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD)— A demonstration of the military utility
of a significant new technology and an assessment to clearly establish operational utility and
system integrity.
Joint Emergent Operational Need— A JEON is an emergent need driven by anticipated
contingency operations that require synchronization across multiple Service/agencies.
Development and fielding timelines are longer than UONs/JUONs with expected initial fielding
occurring up to five years after validation.
Joint Force— A general term applied to a force composed of significant elements, assigned or
attached, of two or more Military Departments operating under a single Joint force commander.
Joint Operational Environment— The environment of land, sea, and/or airspace within which
a Joint force commander employs capabilities to execute assigned missions.
Joint Staff/J8 Gatekeeper— That individual who makes the initial JSD of operational
capability requirements documents. This individual will also make a determination of the lead
and supporting Functional Capabilities Boards (FCBs) for capability documents. The
Gatekeeper is supported in these functions by the FCB working group leads and the JS/J6. The
Joint Staff Deputy Director for Requirements, JS/J8, serves as the JCIDS Gatekeeper.
Joint Staffing Designator (JSD)— A designation assigned by the JS/J8 Gatekeeper to
determine the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System validation and approval
process and the potential requirement for certifications and/or endorsements. See the JCIDS
Manual for the JSD definitions.
Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum (JROCM)— Official JROC
correspondence generally directed to an audience(s) external to the JROC – usually decisional in
nature.
Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUON)— An urgent operational need identified by a
combatant commander involved in an ongoing named operation. A JUON’s main purpose is to
identify and subsequently gain Joint Staff validation and resourcing solution, usually within days
or weeks, to meet a specific high-priority combatant commander need. The scope of a
combatant commander JUON will be limited to addressing urgent operational needs that: (1) fall
outside of the established Service processes; and (2) most importantly, if not addressed
 96                                                    AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014


immediately, will seriously endanger personnel or pose a major threat to ongoing operations.
They should not involve the development of a new technology or capability; however, the
acceleration of a JCTD or modification of an existing system to adapt to a new or similar mission
is within the scope of the JUON validation and resourcing process.
Key Performance Parameter (KPP)— An attribute or characteristic considered critical or
essential to the development of an effective military capability. KPPs must be measurable,
testable, and quantifiable, supported by analytic rigor that demonstrates its operational utility and
the need for resource investment. CDD and CPD KPPs are included verbatim in the acquisition
program baseline. KPP changes require VCSAF approval (or delegate).
Key System Attribute (KSA)— An attribute or characteristic considered crucial to achieving a
balanced solution/approach to a capability, but not critical enough to be designated a KPP.
KSAs provide decision makers with an additional level of capability performance characteristics
(a priority) below the KPP level. KSAs must be measurable, testable, and quantifiable, and
require VCSAF approval (or delegate) to change.
Lead Command— The command that serves as operators’ interface with the Program Manager
for a system as defined by AFPD 10-9.
Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP)— Production of the system in the minimum quantity
necessary (1) to provide production-configured or representative articles for operational tests
pursuant to Title 10 §2399; (2) to establish an initial production base for the system; and (3) to
permit an orderly increase in the production rate for the system sufficient to lead to full-rate
production upon the successful completion of operational testing.
Materiel Development Decision (MDD)— The Materiel Development Decision review is the
formal entry point into the acquisition management system and is mandatory for all programs.
At the MDD, the MDA approves the AoA Study Guidance; determines the acquisition phase of
entry; identifies the initial review milestone; and designates the lead DoD Component(s).
Materiel Solution— Correction of a deficiency, satisfaction of a capability gap, or incorporation
of new technology that results in the development, acquisition, procurement, or fielding of a new
item (including ships, tanks, self-propelled weapons, aircraft, and related software & data,
spares, repair parts, and support equipment, but excluding real property, installations, and
utilities). In the case of family of systems and system of systems approaches, an individual
materiel solution may not fully satisfy a necessary capability gap on its own.
Milestones— Major decision points that separate the phases of an acquisition program.
Milestone Decision Authority (MDA)— The individual designated, in accordance with criteria
established by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, the
Assistant Secretary of Defense (Networks and Information Integration), for Automated
Information System acquisition programs, to approve entry of an acquisition program into the
next phase.
Militarily Useful Capability— A capability that achieves military objectives through
operational effectiveness, suitability and availability, which is interoperable with related systems
and processes, transportable and sustainable when and where needed and at costs known to be
affordable over the long term.
AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                                 97


Modification— An alteration to a configuration item applicable to a warfighter system (i.e.,
aircraft, missiles, support equipment, ground stations software (imbedded), and trainers). As a
minimum, the alteration changes the form, fit, function or interface of the item.
Non-Materiel Solution— Changes in doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and
education, personnel, facilities, or policy (including all HSI domains) to satisfy identified
functional capabilities. The materiel portion is restricted to commercial or non-developmental
items that may be purchased commercially or by purchasing more systems from an existing
materiel program. The acquisition of the materiel portion must comply with all acquisition
policies.
Objective Value— Objective Value - Developed only when absolutely necessary, it is the
desired operational goal associated with a performance attribute beyond which any gain in utility
does not warrant additional expenditure. The objective value is an operationally significant
increment above the threshold. An objective value will be the same as the threshold when an
operationally significant increment above the threshold is not significant or useful. The default
value for Objectives in AF requirements documents will be the Threshold value (i.e., T = O). In
those situations where an objective value is required, the objective value must be analytically
justified in terms of operational risk and impacts to program cost and schedule.
Operating Command— Those commands operating a system, subsystem, or item of equipment.
Operational Capability— The ability to achieve a desired effect under specified standards and
conditions through combinations of means and ways across the doctrine, organization, training,
materiel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities, and policy (DOTmLPF-P) to perform a
set of tasks to execute a specified course of action. It is defined by an operational sponsor and
expressed in broad operational terms in the format of an initial capabilities document or a Joint
DOTmLPF-P change recommendation. In the case of materiel proposals/documents, the
definition will progressively evolve to DOTmLPF-P performance attributes identified in the
capability development document and the capability production document.
Operational Capability Requirements Document— An ICD, IS-ICD, Draft CDD, CDD, IS-
CDD, CPD, or Joint DCR.
Operational Suitability— The degree to which a system can be placed and sustained
satisfactorily in field use with consideration given to availability, compatibility, transportability,
interoperability, reliability, wartime usage rates, maintainability, environmental, safety and
occupational health, human factors, habitability, manpower, logistics, supportability, natural
environment effects and impacts, documentation, and training requirements.
Operational Effectiveness— Measure of the overall ability to accomplish a mission when used
by representative personnel in the environment planned or expected for operational employment
of the system considering organization, doctrine, supportability, survivability, vulnerability, and
threat.
Operator— An operational command or agency that employs acquired systems for the benefit
of warfighters. Operators may also be warfighters.
Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E)— Testing and evaluation conducted in as realistic
an operational environment as possible to estimate the prospective system's operational
capabilities and limitations. In addition, OT&E provides information on operational

effectiveness and suitability, organization, personnel requirements, doctrine, and tactics. It may
also provide data to support or verify material in operating instructions, publications, and
handbooks. NOTE: The term OT&E is often substituted for IOT&E, QOT&E, or FOT&E, and
depending on the context, has the same meaning as those terms.
Program Manager (PM)— As used in this instruction applies collectively to System Program
Director, Product Group Manager, Single Manager, or acquisition program manager. The PM is
the designated individual with responsibility for and authority to accomplish program objectives
for development, production, and sustainment to meet the sponsor's operational needs. The PM
shall be accountable for credible life cycle cost, schedule, and performance reporting to the
MDA.
Quick Reaction Capability— An expedited process for documenting and staffing materiel
solutions to urgent, time-sensitive requirements. The process is fully described in AFI 63-114.
Requirement— see Capability Requirement.
Requirements Manager— A military manager or DOD civilian manager charged with
assessing, developing, validating, and prioritizing requirements and associated requirements
products through the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System process.
Requirements managers are identified by the sponsor and are certified by Defense Acquisition
University upon completion of the appropriate courses.
Requirements Risk Assessment— The requirements risk assessment provides the AFROC the
level of risk to the applicable service core function if a capability requirement is not executed
and how the risk will change if the capability requirement is executed. Additionally, the
requirements risk assessment is used in 1) establishing the justification to proceed with next step
in the JCIDS process (specifically the ICD) 2) to provide a relative comparison of AF programs
for use by the AF principal during FCB prioritization discussions and 3) to inform the AF
planning and programming process to better shape the future force. The requirements risk
assessment encompasses those capabilities for which the AF is pursuing a materiel solution.
Specifically, those capabilities that will lead to development of ICDs and CDDs. A risk
assessment must be accomplished for every capability seeking AFROC validation.
Requirements Strategy Review (RSR)— A strategy review conducted by the AFRRG to
determine the best way to mitigate a capability gap, either by pursuing a non-materiel solution or
entering the JCIDS requirements process.
Sponsor— The organization responsible for documentation, periodic reporting, and funding
actions necessary to support needed capabilities (e.g., MAJCOM, FOA, DRU).
Stakeholder— personnel or organizations (e.g., warfighters, sponsor, or agencies), who are
actively involved in the development of the capability or whose interests may be positively or
negatively affected by the performance of the capability.
Threshold— A minimum acceptable operational value below which the utility of the system
becomes questionable.
Urgent Operational Need— UONs are AF specific needs identified during conflict or crisis
situations that if not satisfied in an expedited manner, would result in unacceptable loss of life or
critical mission failure.

Validation— The review of documentation by an operational authority other than the sponsor to
confirm the operational capability. Validation is a precursor to approval.
Warfighter— An operational command or agency that receives or will receive benefit from the
acquired system. Combatant commanders and their Service component commands are the
warfighters. There may be more than one warfighter for a capability.

desired effects and outcomes as well as the tasks and functions that must be performed.

URGENT OPERATIONAL NEED. Describe the capability shortfall or gap as specifically as
possible to include the tasks or functions that cannot be accomplished or that are unacceptably
limited. Identify whether the gap is due to no existing capability, deficiency in a fielded capability,
or an effective capability fielded in insufficient quantities.

       KEY CHARACTERISTICS: If applicable, describe any key characteristics required for the
       solution and the minimum level of performance for these characteristics. Speed, range,
       payload, accuracy, reliability, interoperability, and mission availability are examples of
       characteristics. If multiple characteristics are provided, they should be prioritized based on
       their value to the warfighter.

       PRIORITY: Describe how this urgent need ranks in priority compared to other urgent needs
       identified by the commander that have not yet been delivered.
AFI 10-601_AFSPCSUP_I 10 JUNE 2014                                                              103


     REQUIRED QUANTITIES: Identify quantities required. Include expected quantities
     required for spares and/or training activities.
