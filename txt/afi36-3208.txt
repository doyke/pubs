SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change revises AFI 36-3208 by (1) adding provisions for Airmen who have made an
unrestricted report of sexual assault within last year of their right to request review and approval
by the general court-martial convening authority of their proposed discharge where the Airman
asserts the discharge is in retaliation for a sexual assault report; (2) adding provisions for
mandatory involuntary discharge processing of Airmen who commit rape, rape of a child, sexual
assault, sexual assault of a child, aggravated sexual contact, abusive sexual contact, forcible
sodomy, or attempt to commit these offenses, and waiver of discharge provisions where Airmen
prove they meet specific retention criteria; and (3) adding an enumerated involuntary separation
provision for Airmen who engage in an unprofessional relationship while serving in a special
position of trust as recruiter, faculty or staff.

                                          Chapter 1

                                GENERAL PROCEDURES

Section 1A—Information Applicable to All Separations.

1.1. Statutory Authority, Approval Authority, and Reasons for Separation:
   1.1.1. Statutory Authority. Laws, Department of Defense (DoD) directives, and policies
   announced by the Secretary of the Air Force authorize the separation of airmen. No member
   may be discharged or released before expiration of term of service (ETS) except as
   prescribed by the Secretary of the Air Force, by sentence of court-martial, or as otherwise
   prescribed by law. The War and Mobilization Separation Policy is at Attachment 2.
   1.1.2. Approval Authority. Each part of this instruction authorizing separation tells who is
   authorized to approve or disapprove the separation. Except when action by the special court-
   martial (SPCM) or general court-martial (GCM) authority is specifically required, the
   commander exercising separation authority may designate, in writing, a staff officer to act on
   the matter. The authority may not be further delegated. Commanders who may exercise
   separation authority include:
       1.1.2.1. General officers who command units.
       1.1.2.2. Commanders of divisions or wings.
       1.1.2.3. Commanders who exercise special or general court-martial jurisdiction.
       1.1.2.4. Others specifically designated by Headquarters Air Force Military Personnel
       Center, Airman Separations Section (HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2).
   1.1.3. Where to Find Reasons for Separation, Characterization and Description.
1.2. Authority of the Secretary to Direct Discharge:
   1.2.1. The Secretary of the Air Force may direct the separation of any airman before ETS, if
   the Secretary determines that such separation is in the best interest of the Air Force. The
   Secretary does not delegate this authority to field commanders. Characterize separation under
   this provision as honorable unless an entry level separation is authorized.
   1.2.2. Separation authorities recommending action under this paragraph will notify the
   member of the proposed action and the reason for the recommendation. Give the member 3
   workdays to submit a rebuttal with the assistance of military legal counsel.
   1.2.3. Separation authorities send cases, through command channels, to the major command
   (MAJCOM) of the commander exercising SPCM authority over the member. MAJCOM
   commanders who concur in the recommendation for discharge send the original and one
   copy of the case to the Airman Separation Section, HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2, for referral to
   the Secretary of the Air Force Personnel Council (AFPC). The MAJCOM commander or vice
   commander must sign the recommendation for action under this paragraph.
   1.2.4. MAJCOM commanders who do not concur in the recommended discharge action
   disapprove the request and return the case to the separation authority.
 16                                                                    AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


1.3. Waivers or Exceptions. The Secretary of the Air Force or a designated representative may
authorize or approve waivers or exceptions to this instruction. Airmen and field commanders
cannot use this provision to appeal decisions made under this instruction.
1.4. Explanation of Terms, Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Addresses. Attachment 1
explains terms as they are used in this instruction. Other terms are used according to AFM 11-1,
volume 1, Air Force Glossary of Standardized Terms. Additionally, Attachment 1 has an
alphabetical list of abbreviations and the offices or organizations represented by office symbols
used throughout this instruction.
1.5. Separation Procedures help achieve authorized force levels and serve as a means to
separate airmen in an orderly fashion. The suitability of persons to serve in the Air Force is
judged on the basis of their conduct and their ability to meet required standards of duty
performance and discipline. Separating members failing to meet standards of performance,
conduct, or discipline, promotes Air Force readiness and strengthens our standards of military
service.
1.6. How to Apply Separation Provisions:
   1.6.1. Separate members of the RegAF and USAFR on extended active duty (EAD) or initial
   active duty training (IADT) under this instruction.
   1.6.2. Release members of the ANGUS from active duty and return them to the Air National
   Guard (ANG) unit of assignment for discharge processing according to ANGR 39-10.
   Discharge USAFR airmen not on EAD or IADT according to AFI 36-8001, Air Force
   Reserve Education and Training (formerly AFR 35-41).
   1.6.3. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1.6.1 and 1.6.2, all airmen who are subject to trial by
   court-martial have the right to ask for discharge in lieu of trial by court-martial. Process such
   requests under Chapter 4.
      1.6.4. Technical training center commanders may discharge a USAFR member with a
      personal hardship or relieve the member from IADT and return to home unit if they are
      expected to continue reserve participation.
1.7. How a Military Service Obligation (MSO) Affects Separation. A member of an armed
force incurs an MSO (Refer to Title 10 U.S.C., Section 651). Normally, airmen with unfulfilled
MSOs are released and transferred to a Reserve component at separation. ANGUS members
revert to their units of assignment. To determine whether an airman should be discharged or
released, refer to Table 1.4 HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2 may direct the discharge of any airman
without regard to an unfulfilled MSO.
1.8. Processing Cases Involving Access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) or
Special Access Programs. AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management (formerly
AFR 205-32) requires special processing in these cases. Comply with the AFI 31-501 procedures
prior to initiating separation action.
1.9. How Incomplete Action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Affects
Separation:
      1.9.1. Once court-martial charges have been preferred, do not administratively discharge an
      airman until:
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                             17


      1.9.1.1. The charges have been withdrawn or dismissed; or
      1.9.1.2. A request for discharge in lieu of trial is approved; or
      1.9.1.3. The airman is acquitted; or
      1.9.1.4. After conviction, the appellate review is final.
   1.9.2. Exceptions to paragraph 1.9.1 may be authorized by:
      1.9.2.1. The GCM authority, if the airman was convicted at a special court-martial and
      the sentence, as approved, does not include a bad conduct discharge.
      1.9.2.2. The Judge Advocate General (HQ USAF/JA) in other cases. Send requests for
      exceptions, with full justification, through JA channels to AFLSA/JAJM, with an
      information copy to HQ AFMPC/ DPMARS2.
   1.9.3. Completing punishment after conviction is not, alone, enough to end this restriction. A
   reversal of the conviction on appeal may cause serious problems, if the airman has been
   discharged.
   1.9.4. Remit any unserved or suspended portion of a sentence (except confinement at hard
   labor or a fine) before a discharge, but this is not a prerequisite to discharge. In particular, do
   not retain an airman solely to serve restriction, hard labor without confinement, or to satisfy a
   forfeiture. NOTE: This also applies to all punishments under Article 15, UCMJ, including
   correctional custody.
      1.9.4.1. Remitting an unserved portion of a sentence to confinement at hard labor at the
      time of discharge is a matter of discretion based on the merits of the case. An airman
      discharged with unserved, unsuspended confinement is required to finish serving the
      sentence. While confined after discharge, the individual is a military prisoner and no
      longer an Air Force member.
      1.9.4.2. A member being discharged and sentenced to pay an outstanding fine, remains
      liable to pay the fine after discharge. (See AFM 177-373, volume 1, for additional
      information).
1.10. What to do if Airmen are Not Medically Qualified for Separation:
   1.10.1. ETS. Revoke or rescind the separation orders before effective date if retention
   beyond ETS is authorized. See paragraph 2.6.
   1.10.2. Approved Prior to Expiration of Term of Service (PETS) Separation
   Pending. Delay the execution of an approved PETS separation for medical reasons that
   become known after the separation is approved. Medical hold under paragraph 2.6 does not
   apply unless the member's date of ETS is near or likely to arrive before medical evaluation is
   completed.
      1.10.2.1. The medical facility tells the military personnel flight (MPF) office whether:
          1.10.2.1.1. An airman needs extensive medical treatment; or
          1.10.2.1.2. The airman's medical qualifications have changed substantially.
      1.10.2.2. The MPF reports the facts of the case to the approval authority and to the
      headquarters that issued the separation orders.
 18                                                                     AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


         1.10.2.3. Revoke or rescind separation orders on or before their effective date when more
         time is needed to resolve questions about the member's medical status.
   1.10.3. Decision Pending on Voluntary or Involuntary PETS Separation. If the
   separating airman is not medically qualified for worldwide duty, process under AFMAN 48-
   123, Medical Examination and Medical Standards (formerly AFR 160-43). Do not use
   medical hold according to paragraph 2.6 unless the member's ETS date is near or likely to
   arrive before medical evaluation is completed. The MPF gives the director of base medical
   services (DBMS) information about the pending separation.
         1.10.3.1. Complete AFI 41-115, Medical Programs and Benefits (formerly AFR 168-4)
         actions before actions in Chapter 2 or Chapter 3, paragraphs 5.9, 5.10, 5.14, 5.26.6, or
         5.65
         1.10.3.2. If disability separation is approved, separate under AFI 36-2902, Physical
         Evaluation for Retention, Retirement, and Separation (formerly AFR 35-4).
         1.10.3.3. If the airman is returned to duty, resume processing under this instruction.
         1.10.3.4. For other involuntary separation actions or requests for discharge in lieu of
         trial, use the instructions in Chapter 6, Section 6E.
1.11. Executing Approved Separations:
      1.11.1. Method. Issue separation orders according to AFI 37-128, Administrative Orders
      (formerly AFR 10-7) and other separation documents as prescribed by AFI 36-3202,
      Separation Documents (formerly AFR 35-6).
      1.11.2. Effective Date. Separation is effective on the date stated in the separation order
      when the airman has been notified of the date. Otherwise, separation is effective on the date
      the airman is notified. Execute involuntary discharges as soon as possible but within 10
      calendar days after the separation authority makes the final decision. NOTE: There must be a
      bonafide military reason for establishing a date of separation beyond 10 days. Unused
      accrued leave is not a reason.
      1.11.3. Notice of Separation. Notice of separation may be:
         1.11.3.1. Actual, by giving a copy of the separation order/DD Form 214, Certificate of
         Release or Discharge from Active Duty, to the airman.
         1.11.3.2. Constructive, when actual delivery cannot be made.
      1.11.4. Effective Time. Separation is effective at 2400 hours on date of separation;
      however, for Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) purposes, separation is effective
      upon receipt of a discharge certificate issued under proper authority (DD Form 214 and/or
      DD Form 256AF, Honorable Discharge), a final accounting of pay, and completion of the
      clearing process established by the Air Force.
      1.11.5. Refusal to Accept Separation. Tell airmen of the fact, date, and cause of
      separation. Order them to leave the base. Place separation documents with a letter giving the
      facts of the case in the field record group (FRGp) for AFI 36-2608, Military Personnel
      Records Systems (formerly AFR 35-44) disposition.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                        19


1.12. In Absentia Separation. The release or discharge of a member not under military control
or not present to take part in the action. As a rule, do not separate in absentia airmen absent
without authority. In most cases, once an airman separates, the Air Force loses jurisdiction for
offenses committed before the discharge. If trial by court-martial is appropriate, don't separate
the member in absentia. The GCM authority, or a higher authority, must approve discharge in
absentia.
   1.12.1. Process a member for discharge in absentia and execute the discharge without prior
   authorization of HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2 only to:
       1.12.1.1. Release a person from a void enlistment.
       1.12.1.2. Complete the action in the case of a member absent without authority. If the
       member requested discharge in lieu of trial by court-martial or acknowledged receipt of
       the notice of involuntary discharge processing before the unauthorized absence began,
       complete the processing according to the provision under which the member was
       notified. Coordinate with the servicing staff judge advocate prior to completing the
       discharge action.
       1.12.1.3. Separate airmen in civil confinement, for civilian conviction or fraudulent
       enlistment. For more information see Chapter 5, Section 5C and Section 5H. NOTE:
       Except as outlined in paragraphs 5.51 and 5.52.2, do not discharge in absentia under
       Section 5H, Misconduct.
   1.12.2. Execution of in absentia separation:
       1.12.2.1. Do not separate airmen in absentia if:
           1.12.2.1.1. Confined in a foreign penal institution; or
           1.12.2.1.2. Whereabouts are unknown, and they are absent without authority from an
           oversea base.
       1.12.2.2. Execute an approved separation in absentia if:
           1.12.2.2.1. Member is being released from a void enlistment,
           1.12.2.2.2. Reason for discharge is civil court disposition or fraudulent enlistment
           and the restrictions in 1.12.2.1 do not apply,
           1.12.2.2.3. GCM authority directs vacation of suspension of an approved
           administrative discharge according to Chapter 7, or
           1.12.2.2.4. Processing was completed according to 1.12.1 (second bullet) above. The
           document signed by the discharge authority states that the member is absent without
           authority and that separation in absentia is authorized.
   1.12.3. HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2 authorizes certain other in absentia processing on a case-
   by-case basis (See Chapter 6, Section 6I). Process a member for discharge in absentia and
   execute the discharge if:
       1.12.3.1. Prosecution of the member is apparently barred. For more information, see
       Article 43, UCMJ.
 20                                                                      AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


         1.12.3.2. The member is an alien living in a foreign country where the United States
         lacks authority to apprehend.
      1.12.4. Reporting in absentia separations:
         1.12.4.1. DD Form 553, Deserter/Absentee Wanted by the Armed Forces, may have
         been sent out in connection with the member's absence. In those cases, send DD Form
         616, Report of Return of Absentee, to all those who received the DD Form 553. The
         DD Form 616 must show that the airman has been discharged. It must state that the Air
         Force does not want the member returned to military control.
         1.12.4.2. MPF Personnel Relocation Elements mail two copies of the discharge order to
         HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2 when an airman who has been taken off the unit rolls is
         discharged in absentia. HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2 makes the requisite personnel data
         system (PDS) entries to drop the member from the strength of the Air Force.
      1.12.5. By certified mail, return receipt requested, MPF Personnel Relocation Elements send
      the separation documents to airmen:
         1.12.5.1. At the penal institution if they are in civil confinement.
         1.12.5.2. At the home of record if their whereabouts are unknown. If the documents are
         returned unclaimed, MPF Personnel Relocation Elements sends them to the same place
         they sent the FRGp. For more information, see AFI 36-2608. (formerly AFR 35-44).
1.13. Separation Obtained by Fraud. Federal civilian courts may prosecute a person who gets
a separation from the Air Force by misrepresentation, concealment, or fraud (Title 18 U.S.C.,
Sections 287 and 1001). It is also possible to revoke a separation and return the offender to
military control for trial by court-martial. The decision to revoke a separation is an
administrative determination based on consideration of all the facts of the case. If revocation is
appropriate, send the case to the GCM authority for final decision.
1.14. Handling Serious Misconduct While Separation is Pending. The commander reports
serious misconduct by the airman to the separation authority at once. This includes misconduct
that occurs at any time after the airman applies, or is recommended, for separation. The
separation authority may withhold execution of a separation and, upon review of additional
evidence, may withdraw approval of a voluntary or involuntary separation. The unit commander
then takes other action according to the facts of the case. NOTE: Separate airmen at ETS unless
Chapter 2 authorizes their retention.
1.15. Other Factors Affecting Eligibility:
      1.15.1. Indebtedness. Indebtedness to the government or to a person does not bar the
      separation of a member who is otherwise eligible for separation.
      1.15.2. Pending Involuntary Discharge. Usually, an airman is ineligible for voluntary
      separation PETS while the involuntary action is pending.

Section 1B—Guidelines for Characterizing Service or Describing Separation.

1.16. Authorized Types of Separation:
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                           21


   1.16.1. Each part of this instruction that authorizes separation tells whether to characterize
   service with the separation. Characterization of service may be:
      1.16.1.1. Honorable;
      1.16.1.2. Under Honorable Conditions (General); or
      1.16.1.3. Under Other than Honorable Conditions (UOTHC).
   1.16.2. If you do not characterize service with the separation, describe the separation as:
      1.16.2.1. Entry level separation;
      1.16.2.2. Release from the custody and control of the Air Force by reason of void
      enlistment; or
      1.16.2.3. Dropped from the rolls of the Air Force.
   1.16.3. For more information about separation without characterizing service, see
   paragraph 1.19.
1.17. What to Consider When Characterizing Service:
   1.17.1. Base this on the quality of the member's service as reflected in the military record of
   the current enlistment or period of service including personal conduct, performance of duty,
   and the reason for separation. For more guidance, see paragraph 1.18 Determine the quality
   of service according to standards of acceptable personal conduct and performance of duty for
   airmen. You will find these standards in the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), Air
   Force directives and instructions, and the time honored customs and traditions of military
   service.
   1.17.2. You may consider conduct in the civilian community in characterizing service at
   separation. Such conduct need not be subject to UCMJ jurisdiction. Conduct in the civilian
   community that brings discredit on the Air Force, or conduct prejudicial to good order and
   discipline, adversely affects the quality of a member's service. The burden of proof is on the
   member to show that such conduct did not adversely affect the member's service.
   1.17.3. Usually, base service characterization on a pattern of behavior rather than an isolated
   incident. Evaluate the frequency and seriousness of the disciplinary infractions and consider
   total service in the current enlistment. Consider the airman's age, length of service, grade,
   aptitude, physical and mental condition, and the standards of acceptable conduct and
   performance of duty for airmen. There are circumstances, however, in which the conduct or
   performance of duty reflected by a single incident, particularly in a misconduct case, may
   provide the basis for characterizing the service.
1.18. Types of Service Characterization:
   1.18.1. Honorable. The quality of the airman's service generally has met Air Force
   standards of acceptable conduct and performance of duty or when a member's service is
   otherwise so meritorious that any other characterization would be inappropriate.
   1.18.2. Under Honorable Conditions (General). If an airman's service has been honest
   and faithful, this characterization is warranted when significant negative aspects of the
   airman's conduct or performance of duty outweigh positive aspects of the airman's military
   record.
 22                                                                  AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


   1.18.3. Under Other than Honorable Conditions. When basing the reason for separation
   on a pattern of behavior or one or more acts or omissions that constitute a significant
   departure from the conduct expected of airmen. The member must have an opportunity for a
   hearing by an administrative discharge board or request discharge in lieu of trail by court-
   martial. Examples of such behavior, acts, or omissions include, but are not limited to:
      1.18.3.1. The use of force or violence to produce serious bodily injury or death.
      1.18.3.2. Abuse of a special position of trust.
      1.18.3.3. Disregard by a superior of customary superior - subordinate relationships.
      1.18.3.4. Acts or omissions that endanger the security of the United States.
      1.18.3.5. Acts or omissions that endanger the health and welfare of other members of the
      Air Force.
      1.18.3.6. Deliberate acts or omissions that seriously endanger the health and safety of
      other persons.
      1.18.3.7. Rape, sexual assault, aggravated sexual contact, abusive sexual contact, rape of
      a child, sexual assault of a child, sexual abuse of a child, forcible sodomy and attempts to
      commit these offenses.
1.19. Separation without Service Characterization:
   1.19.1. Entry Level Separation. Airmen are in entry level status during the first 180 days
   of continuous active military service or the first 180 days of continuous active military
   service after a break of more than 92 days of active service. Determine the member's status
   by the date of notification; thus, if the member is in entry level status when initiating the
   separation action, describe it as an entry level separation unless:
      1.19.1.1. A service characterization of under other than honorable conditions is
      authorized under the reason for discharge and is warranted by the circumstances of the
      case; or
      1.19.1.2. The Secretary of the Air Force determines, on a case-by-case basis, that
      characterization as honorable is clearly warranted by unusual circumstances of personal
      conduct and performance of military duty. The separation authority will forward a
      recommendation for an honorable characterization to HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2, 550 C
      Street West, Ste 11, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4713, for review and further processing.
      Use this characterization if the reason for separation is:
          1.19.1.2.1. A change in military status according to Chapter 2;
          1.19.1.2.2. For the convenience of the government according to Chapter 3;
          1.19.1.2.3. For disability according to AFI 36-2902 (formerly AFR 35-4); or
          1.19.1.2.4. Directed by the Secretary of the Air Force according to paragraph 1.2.
   1.19.2. Release from the Custody and Control of the Air Force. Describe separation
   from a void enlistment as an order of release from the custody and control of the Air Force.
   A person released from a void enlistment does not receive a discharge or a service
   characterization. For more information about void enlistments, see Chapter 2, Section 2B.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                         23


   1.19.3. Dropping from the Rolls of the Air Force. On a case-by-case basis, HQ AFMPC/
   DPMARS2 may authorize termination of a member's military status by dropping from the
   rolls of the Air Force. In these cases, do not use service characterization or another
   description of separation. This action is not the same as that authorized by AFMAN 36-2125,
   Military Personnel Strength Accounting Methods (formerly AFR 35-40) where airmen are
   dropped from the unit rolls but retain military status. As a rule, HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2 will
   authorize separation by dropping from the rolls of the Air Force only if:
       1.19.3.1. A member has been absent for a prolonged period; and
       1.19.3.2. Return to military control would serve no useful purpose.
1.20. Period Considered in Characterizing Service. Except as provided in paragraph 1.20.2,
determine characterization of service solely by the member's military record during the current
enlistment or period of service to which the separation pertains, plus any extensions of the
enlistment prescribed by law or regulation, or made with the consent of the member. Do not
consider:
   1.20.1. Prior service activities, including but not limited to records of conviction by courts-
   martial, records of absence without leave, or commission of other offenses for which
   punishment was not imposed. You may consider this information for retention or separation,
   but the record of the proceedings must show it was not used for characterization.
   1.20.2. Preservice activities, except in a case based on fraudulent enlistment. In fraudulent
   entry cases, consider evidence of preservice misrepresentations about matters that would
   have precluded, postponed, or otherwise affected the member's eligibility for enlistment.
1.21. Limitations on Service Characterization. In some cases, evidence in the member's
record used to show that a basis for discharge exists, may not be considered to determine how the
airman's service should be characterized. Consult a staff judge advocate (SJA) for help in using
evidence. If the separation authority directs the issuance of an under honorable conditions
(General) or under other than honorable conditions discharge in a case containing such evidence,
the instrument that directs discharge must state the other circumstances of the airman's military
record warranting such a service characterization. In addition to the restrictions imposed in
paragraph 1.20, the following limitations apply:
   1.21.1. Do not consider conduct that has been the subject of judicial proceedings resulting in
   an acquittal or action having the effect thereof on the issue of characterization except when:
       1.21.1.1. Such action is based on a judicial determination not going to the guilt or
       innocence of the respondent; or
       1.21.1.2. A state or foreign court conducted the judicial proceeding and the Office of the
       Secretary of the Air Force approves the discharge.
   1.21.2. Conduct that has been the subject of a prior administrative board in which the board
   entered an approved finding that the evidence did not sustain the factual allegations
   concerning the conduct, may not be considered on the issue of characterization except:
       1.21.2.1. When there is subsequent conduct or performance forming the basis, in whole
       or in part, for a new proceeding;
 24                                                                  AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


       1.21.2.2. When there is new or newly discovered evidence that was not reasonably
       available at the time of the prior proceeding; or
       1.21.2.3. When the conduct is the subject of a rehearing ordered on the basis of fraud or
       collusion.
   1.21.3. Do not discharge an airman under other than honorable conditions if the sole basis
   for discharge is a serious offense that resulted in conviction by a court-martial that did not
   adjudge a punitive discharge unless such characterization is approved by the Secretary of the
   Air Force (paragraph 5.47.2). NOTE: A punitive discharge is imposed when announced by
   the court martial.
   1.21.4. If the provisions of AFI 36-2701, Social Actions Program (formerly AFR 30-2) are
   met, do not consider:
       1.21.4.1. The member's voluntary self-identification for treatment for drug abuse.
       1.21.4.2. The evidence the member voluntarily provides in connection with the self-
       identification.
   1.21.5. Do not use the results of mandatory drug testing for controlled substances if the
   testing was conducted during a command-directed examination or command directed referral
   of a specific member to determine the member's competency for duty and/or need for
   counseling, treatment or other medical treatment when there is a reasonable suspicion of drug
   abuse, or during an examination of a specified member in conjunction with the member's
   participation in a drug treatment program. NOTE: Evidence obtained from an examination
   ordered for a valid medical purpose under Military Rules of Evidence (M.R.E). 312 (f) may
   be considered on the issue of characterization. For more information, see AFI 36-2701.
   1.21.6. If AFPAM 36-2703, Air Force Substance/Abuse Evaluation Guide (formerly AFP
   30-33) provisions are met, do not use information concerning personal alcohol and drug
   abuse provided by the member in response to screening questions.
   1.21.7. The limitations on service characterization in paragraphs 1.21.3, 1.21.4, and 1.21.5
   do not apply in the following matters:
       1.21.7.1. The introduction of such evidence to impeach or rebut evidence of drug abuse
       (or the lack thereof) first introduced by the respondent.
       1.21.7.2. The use of independently derived evidence, including the results of mandatory
       drug testing not specifically excluded from consideration and evidence of drug abuse
       after the member's first entry into the substance abuse treatment program, on the issue of
       service characterization.
1.22. How the Type of Separation Affects the Individual. The Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB)
requires personnel entering active duty after 30 Jun 85 to receive an honorable discharge in order
to qualify for educational benefits. Also see AFP 110-3, Civil Law, for more information about
how service characterization affects specific benefits based on military service.
   1.22.1. Separations with service characterization of honorable or under honorable conditions
   (General) are usually treated the same with respect to benefits administered by the Veterans'
   Administration (VA) or other federal and state agencies. As a rule, either entitles the veteran
   to full rights and benefits.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                         25


   1.22.2. Discharge under other than honorable conditions may deprive a veteran of benefits
   based on military service. The agency that administers the benefits makes a determination in
   each case.
   1.22.3. With respect to administrative matters not governed by this directive and requiring a
   service characterization as honorable or under honorable conditions (General), treat an entry
   level separation as the required characterization. This provision does not apply to
   administrative matters that expressly require different treatment of an entry level separation.
   1.22.4. Failure to complete at least 2 years of continuous active duty may make members
   who originally enlisted after 8 September 1980 and members who reentered active duty after
   16 October 1981 who had not previously completed 24 months of continuous active duty or
   been discharged or released from active duty under Title 10 U.S.C., Section 1171 ineligible
   for certain benefits. This restriction does not apply to airmen discharged for hardship,
   separated for physical disability under AFI 36-2902 (formerly AFR 35-4), or discharged
   under Title 10 U.S.C, Section 1171 within 3 months of their ETS. For more information, see
   Title 38 U.S.C., Section 5303A.
   1.22.5. Discharge for some reasons may affect entitlement to veterans' benefits without
   regard to the type of separation. For example, Title 38 U.S.C, Section 5303 provides that a
   discharge under other than honorable conditions based wholly, or in part, on a continuous
   unauthorized absence that lasts 180 days or more is a conditional bar to eligibility for
   Veterans` Administration benefits.
1.23. Periodic Explanation of the Types of Separation:
   1.23.1. Periodically, tell airmen
      1.23.1.1. How they may be separated from the Air Force;
      1.23.1.2. The basis for describing or characterizing service;
      1.23.1.3. The possible effects of each type of separation on their reenlistment eligibility,
      civilian employment, veterans' benefits, and such matters; and
      1.23.1.4. The provisions of Title 38 U.S.C., Section 5303A denying certain benefits to
      most persons who fail to complete at least 2 years of continuous active duty.
   1.23.2. The explanation will be given by a judge advocate each time the articles of the
   Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) are explained as required by Title 10 U.S.C.,
   Section 937.
   1.23.3. For a written fact sheet that may accompany, or serve as a substitute for the oral
   explanation, see Attachment 3.
   1.23.4. An airman's failure to receive or to understand this explanation will not be
   considered a defense in, or a bar to, an administrative proceeding under this instruction.

Section 1C—Other Requirements and Procedures.

1.24. Separation Documents. Airmen separated under this instruction receive documents as
prescribed by AFI 36-3202 (formerly AFR 35-6).
1.25. Reports Requiring Special Handling:
 26                                                                    AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


      1.25.1. Handle reports furnished through the Office of Special Investigation (OSI) channels
      according to instructions in AFI 90-301, Use, disclosure and safeguard of IG Records
      (formerly AFR 124-4).
      1.25.2. Comply with AFMAN 48-123 (formerly AFR 168-43) in handling or releasing
      reports of medical examinations and physical or psychiatric evaluations.
      1.25.3. Hold Defense Investigative Service (DIS) reports that contain unfavorable
      information in the special security file for the member as required by DoD 5200.2-R/AFI 31-
      501.
      1.25.4. Refer to DoD 5200.2-R/AFI 31-501 for guidance on protecting and safeguarding
      classified information that may become part of any discharge proceedings.
1.26. Aliens Seeking Naturalization. Some alien members may qualify for naturalization
based on their military service. For more information, see AFP 211-28, Naturalization and
Citizenship. They need to serve at least 3 years. A combination of full-time active service and
inactive Reserve time will meet this requirement. Separation authorities must be sure that aliens
who want to qualify for naturalization are not voluntarily discharged even a few days short of 3
years.
1.27. Disposition of Correspondence. Comply with AFMAN 37-139, Disposition of Air Force
Records - Records Disposition Schedule (formerly AFR 4-20, volume 2) and AFI 36-2608
(formerly AFR 35-44). Additional instructions for disposition of case files are found in Table
1.5.
1.28. High Level Inquiries. When the Air Force Military Personnel Center (AFMPC) asks for
facts to use in replying to a high level inquiry about a separation case, the servicing MPF
responds by message (includes MINIMIZE). For a format of the reply, see Figure 1.1 or Figure
1.2. Reply within 24 hours if the inquiry does not set another suspense. If the first reply does not
give the final action on the case, send another report when final action is taken.
1.29. Disposition of Cases Pending. Process cases to completion according to the directives in
effect at the time the processing starts. Apply this rule to the implementation of this instruction
and subsequent changes to it. The processing of a case starts when the MPF receives an
application for voluntary discharge or when written notice of the proposed discharge has been
given or mailed to the respondent.

1.30. Special Processing Procedures for Airmen Deployed Overseas in Support of a
Contingency Operation. The following additional criteria as stipulated below applies to
Airmen who are being recommended for discharge under Chapter 5 of this Instruction and who
have been deployed overseas in support of a contingency operation within 24 months prior to
initiation of discharge:
    1.30.1. Must receive a medical examination in accordance with Chapter 6, paragraphs 6.3.
    and 6.9.3. of this Instruction. The medical examination must assess whether the effects of
    post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or traumatic brain injury (TBI) constitute matters in
    extenuation that relate to the basis for administrative separation if the Airman:
       1.30.1.1. Is being administratively separated under a characterization other than
       Honorable; and
       1.30.1.2. Was deployed overseas to a contingency operation during the previous 24
       months; and
       1.30.1.3. Is diagnosed by a physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist as
       experiencing PTSD or TBI, or reasonably alleges the influence of PTSD or TBI based on
 34                                                                  AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


      deployed service to a contingency operation during the previous 24 months. NOTE: In a
      case involving PTSD, the medical examination shall be performed by a clinical
      psychologist or psychiatrist. In a case involving TBI, the medical examination may be
      performed by a physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or other health care
      professional, as appropriate; and
      1.30.1.4. Is not being separated under a sentence of a court-martial, or other proceeding
      conducted pursuant to the UCMJ to include request for separation under Chapter 4 of this
      Instruction.
   1.30.2. Before an Airman can be discharged under other than honorable conditions, the
   initiating commander, administrative discharge board (if applicable), SPCM authority and
   GCM authority must receive and review a medical examination in compliance with
   paragraph 1.30.1. Although specific comments are not required; the commander and other
   reviewing authorities identified in this paragraph must indicate the medical examination was
   reviewed.
   1.30.3. This provision does not change any other processing requirements of this Instruction
   to include but not limited to Dual Action Processing, Service Retirement Eligibility and
   Airmen with Lengthy Service under Chapter 6.
1.31. Special Processing Procedures for Airmen Who Have Made an Unrestricted Report
of a Sexual Assault:
   1.31.1. Notification to Separation Authority. In accordance with AFI 36-6001, Sexual
   Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Program, paragraph 6.5.2, a commander who is
   aware, or is made aware by the Airman or others, that the Airman is alleged to have been the
   victim of a sexual assault must notify the separation authority that the discharge proceeding
   involves the victim of a sexual assault.
      1.31.1.1. The commander should include a statement indicating that the member has
      reported being a past victim of sexual assault in the recommendation for discharge
      memorandum (Figure 6.5, paragraph m).
      1.31.1.2. In the recommendation for discharge memorandum (Figure 6.5, paragraph m),
      the commander recommending discharge must provide sufficient information to the
      separation authority concerning the alleged assault and the respondent’s status to ensure a
      full and fair consideration of the member’s military service and particular situation. As
      necessary, include information by reference with corresponding attachments.
      Commanders should consult with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations and the
      servicing staff judge advocate for guidance on the level of information that may be
      applicable.
   1.31.2. Notice and GCM Authority Review. An Airman who is being recommended for
   discharge under Chapter 5 of this Instruction must be advised of the right to request review
   by the GCM authority who is a general officer if the Airman believes the recommendation
   for involuntary separation was initiated in retaliation for having made an unrestricted report
   of a sexual assault within the last 12 months as of the date of notification of discharge. The
   following additional criteria apply to Airmen who are being recommended for discharge
   under Chapter 5 of this Instruction and who have made an unrestricted report of a sexual
   assault within the last 12 months as of the date of notification of discharge:
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                       35


     1.31.2.1. An Airman may request review by the GCM authority of a recommendation for
     discharge any time prior to approval of the discharge by the applicable separation
     authority.
     1.31.2.2. An Airman requesting review of a recommended discharge must affirmatively
     assert the belief that the discharge was initiated in retaliation for making a report of
     sexual assault.
     1.31.2.3. When an Airman requests review, the case must be referred to the GCM
     authority for the final separation decision. If the GCM authority is not a general officer,
     the case must be referred to the next higher level of command who is a general officer.
     1.31.2.4. When an Airman requests review, the GCM authority must review the
     circumstances of, and grounds for, the proposed involuntary separation.
        1.31.2.4.1. If the GCM authority determines the recommendation for discharge was
        made in retaliation for the report of sexual assault, the GCM authority will terminate
        the discharge. In such cases, the GCM authority may refer the retaliation
        determination to the appropriate inspector general for additional consideration and
        possible investigation.
        1.31.2.4.2. If the GCM authority determines the recommendation for discharge was
        not made in retaliation for the report of sexual assault, the GCM authority may
        approve the discharge, if there is sufficient evidence to support separation and
        separation is warranted. The GCM authority must indicate that the recommendation
        for discharge was not made in retaliation for the report of sexual assault.
     1.31.2.5. In any case where the GCM authority terminates a discharge based solely upon
     a finding that the recommendation for discharge was made in retaliation for the report of
     sexual assault, the GCM authority can refer the case to an impartial commander for a new
     determination of whether separation should be initiated based on the facts of the case
     independent of the report of sexual assault. Such referral is permitted regardless of the
     restrictions on separation in cases resulting in retention set forth in paragraph 5.4.3.
 36                                                                  AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


                                           Chapter 2

                                REQUIRED SEPARATIONS

Section 2A—Expiration of Term of Service (ETS).

2.1. Eligibility for Separation. Airmen are absolutely entitled to separation from active duty at
ETS unless there is a specific authority for their retention. ETS occurs when an airman completes
an enlistment or the term of active service required by the active duty orders. The Air Force sets
terms of service according to the law. AFIs 36-2002, Enlistment in the United States Air Force
(formerly AFR 33-3) and 36-2606, US Air Force Reenlistment, Retention, and NCO Status
Programs (formerly AFR 35-16, volume 1) set terms of enlistment.
   2.1.1. As a rule, separate airmen on the date ETS occurs, but their separation is not
   automatic. They are members of the Air Force until they are separated by administrative
   action. Retain airmen only when their enlistments are extended by law or when one of the
   conditions described in paragraphs 2.3 through 2.7 exists.
2.2. ETS Separation. Base separation authorities separate airmen at ETS under this paragraph.
The service of an airman separated at ETS will be characterized as honorable. To find whether to
discharge, release or transfer an airman who has an unfulfilled MSO, see Table 1.4. To find
when an ETS separation may take place before ETS, see paragraphs 2.2.1 and 2.2.2.
   2.2.1. A separation is an ETS separation if the member is within 30 days of ETS and is
   serving overseas or is a non continental United States resident serving outside the home state,
   territory, or possession. For example, a person who is a resident of Alaska, Hawaii, Guam,
   etc, serving in CONUS is considered to be serving overseas. EXCEPTION: If the member
   has been approved for involuntary separation or separation in lieu of trial by court-martial,
   the separation is not considered an ETS separation.
   2.2.2. A member of the Regular Air Force may ask for separation on the last workday before
   ETS if the ETS falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a holiday. This workday will be the effective
   date of separation (DOS). Place the request for early separation in the FRGp for permanent
   retention. Separate airmen who do not ask for ETS separation on the last workday before
   ETS on ETS.
2.3. Retention to Make Good Time Lost. Airmen who are unable to perform duty for 1 day or
more for a reason listed in Title 10 U.S.C., Section 972 are liable to make good the time lost. If
they want to reenlist, they must first make good the time lost. For more information, see AFI 36-
2606 (formerly AFR 35-16, volume 1). For airmen who are ineligible, or who do not intend to
reenlist, separation at the original ETS may be in the best interest of the Air Force.
   2.3.1. As a rule, commanders should start action to waive the liability to make good the time
   lost at least 30 days before the original ETS. The separation authority may waive liability to
   make good 180 days or less. HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2 may waive liability of more than 180
   days. For example, if a commander recommends a waiver in the case of an airman who had
   230 days time lost, the separation authority may:
       2.3.1.1. Waive 180 days or less and require the airman to make good the remainder; or
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                            37


       2.3.1.2. Waive 180 days and refer the case to HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2 with a
       recommendation for waiver of all or part of the remainder.
2.4. Retention for Action by Court-Martial. For information about how incomplete court-
martial action affects separation from active duty, see paragraph 1.9 These restrictions also
apply to ETS separations. This paragraph authorizes the retention of airmen beyond ETS in
anticipation of the preferring of charges. The SJA determines what type of appropriate action is
sufficient to authorize retention pending the preferring of charges. If there is sufficient time, the
Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) or a member of the SJA's staff will notify the MPF separations unit
in writing to involuntarily extend the member's ETS.
   2.4.1. Verbally notify when time does not permit written notification, but written
   confirmation of the verbal notice should be provided the MPF within 5 work days.
2.5. Retention to Complete Separation Processing. Retain airmen beyond ETS for the
convenience of the government to complete separation processing if they:
   2.5.1. Are en route to the place of separation.
   2.5.2. Decline to reenlist as scheduled. Airmen scheduled for reenlistment within 7 calendar
   days of their DOS sign a statement agreeing to be retained beyond DOS if they do not
   reenlist. See AFI 36-2606, table 4.7 (formerly AFR 35-16, volume 1) for more information.
   Retain for separation processing only.
2.6. Retention for Medical Treatment or Evaluation. Retain airmen beyond ETS with their
consent (medical hold) for medical treatment or evaluation when their attending physician feels
they are not medically qualified for retirement or separation. The medical facility sends the
request to HQ AFMPC, Medical Standards Division (DPMMM). HQ AFMPC/DPMMM
approves medical hold according to AFMAN 48-123 (formerly AFR 160-43).
   2.6.1. Do not retain airmen beyond ETS without their consent, unless they are physically
   incapable of expressing consent and have no guardian to act for them. Consent may be
   presumed in these cases. Make sure airmen (or their guardians) understand the advantages of
   retention for treatment or evaluation for possible disability separation.
   2.6.2. For formats of the statements requesting or declining to request retention, see Figure
   2.1 and Figure 2.2 File the statement in the FRGp. Make a written report of the
   circumstances if the airman or guardian will not sign one of the statements. Separate the
   airman on ETS if retention for treatment or evaluation has not been authorized. Comply with
   AFMAN 48-123 (formerly AFR 160-43) to arrange for post separation treatment of an
   airman who has been hospitalized.
2.7. Airmen Awaiting Disposition by Foreign Courts. With their consent, retain airmen
beyond ETS while they wait for disposition of criminal charges by civilian authorities in a
foreign country. Commanders and personnel officers should start their action at least 1 month
before the airman's ETS or as soon as they have information showing that civil court disposition
may not be complete by ETS. The commander informs the MPF of the facts of the case and the
need for retention.
   2.7.1. If an airman's ETS will pass while the civil charges are still pending:
       2.7.1.1. MPF Personnel Relocation Element reports the facts of the case to HQ USAF,
       International and Operations Law Division (HQ USAF/JAI), and HQ
 38                                                                   AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


       AFMPC/DPMARS2 by message (includes MINIMIZE). Make the affected MAJCOMs
       information addressees.
       2.7.1.2. The commander tells the foreign officials the airman's ETS is near and asks them
       to give the airman permission to leave the country permanently.
       2.7.1.3. If the foreign officials do not grant such permission, try to get the airman to ask
       for retention. The format in Figure 2.3 should be used for the airman's request. Be sure
       the airman understands how his or her status before the court may be affected by
       separation from the Air Force in a foreign country. The commander makes sure the
       airman is given a chance to consult military counsel before signing either the request for
       retention or the statement declining to do so. Place the airman's statement in the FRGp
       for permanent retention.
   2.7.2. By message (includes MINIMIZE) notify HQ USAF/JAI, HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2,
   and the affected MAJCOMs if:
       2.7.2.1. The airman refuses to request retention; and
       2.7.2.2. The foreign authorities do not consent to the airman's departure while charges
       are pending.
2.8. Extension of Enlistment When Discharge for Cause is Pending. Do not retain airmen
beyond ETS involuntarily for completion of involuntary discharge processing. They may request
an extension of the enlistment under AFI 36-2606 (formerly AFR 35-16). If ETS is near and the
involuntary action will not be completed by ETS, the immediate commander:
   2.8.1. Gives the airman a chance to voluntarily extend the enlistment for the time needed to
   complete the case.
   2.8.2. Tells the airman that if separation takes place on ETS while the involuntary discharge
   is pending, the airman will not be eligible to reenlist.
   2.8.3. Allows the airman time to consult military legal counsel before deciding whether to
   extend the enlistment.
   2.8.4. Separates, on ETS, the airman who declines to extend.

Section 2B—Changes in Service Obligation.

2.9. Determining Eligibility. Eligibility for separation under this section is based on a change,
or a proposed change, in a member's obligation to serve the full term of an enlistment contract.
Such a change may involve appointment to officer status, a new term of enlistment, separation
from the active force to serve with one of the Reserve forces, or a defect in the enlistment. On
receipt of evidence that a member is qualified for separation for one of the reasons in this
section, the separation authority:
   2.9.1. Concurs in the action and establishes a DOS consistent with the reason for the
   separation;
   2.9.2. Gives the organization that made the selection or requested the separation, information
   about circumstances that may cast doubt on the propriety of the action; or
   2.9.3. Disapproves request.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                         39


2.10. Type of Separation. Characterize the service of airmen separated for a reason in
paragraphs 2.11 through 2.18 as honorable unless an entry level separation is required
according to paragraph 1.19 Separation from a void enlistment under paragraph 2.19 will be
by order of release from custody and control of the Air Force. Describe separation under
paragraph 2.20 for minority as an entry level separation.
2.11. Completion of Officer Training. Discharge graduates of officer training contingent on
their acceptance of appointment as commissioned officers. Make the discharge effective the day
before they take the oath of office as Air Force officers. Do not deliver the discharge documents
until after the oath of office has been executed. For more information about these separations,
see AFI 36-2013, Airman Commissioning Programs and Officer Training School (formerly AFR
53-20).
2.12. Immediate Reenlistment or Enlistment. Discharge airmen contingent on their
enlistment or reenlistment in the Regular Air Force without a break in service. Make the
discharge effective the day before the airman enlists or reenlists. Do not deliver the discharge
documents until the enlistment or reenlistment documents have been signed.
   2.12.1. Members of the Regular Air Force must qualify for reenlistment under AFI 36-2606
   (formerly AFR 35-16, volume 1).
   2.12.2. Members of the USAFR must qualify for enlistment in the Regular Air Force
   according to AFI 36-2002 (formerly AFR 33-3).
2.13. Appointment as a Commissioned or Warrant Officer. Discharge airmen who are
offered appointments as commissioned or warrant officers in one of the armed forces contingent
on their acceptance of the appointment. They must show evidence that they will be ordered to
active duty in the officer grade. For a format of the airman's request for separation, use Figure
3.1 which is AF Form 31, Airman's Request For Early Separation/ Separation Based On
Change In Service Obligation. See Table 1.5 for disposition of the form.
   2.13.1. Make the discharge effective the day before the first day of active duty as an officer.
   Do not give the discharge documents to the member until the oath of office has been
   executed.
2.14. Service with an ANGUS or USAFR Unit (PALACE CHASE). Airmen may ask for
separation from the active military service to serve with an ANGUS or a USAFR unit. AFI 36-
3205, Reserve Forces Procurement Palace Chase (formerly AFRs 35-46 and 35-47) gives the
eligibility criteria and procedures for selection. Separate airmen whose applications are approved
under this provision. The airman may use AF Form 1288, Application for Ready Reserve
Assignment, 3d indorsement, to apply for palace chase separation. The routing and approval or
disapproval authority are in Figure 3.1 and Table 3.1
2.15. Entering an AFROTC Program. Airmen are eligible for discharge if they are accepted
for the AFROTC Airman Scholarship and Commissioning Program (ASCP) or the Air Force
Reserve Officers Training Corps (AFROTC) Professional Officer Course (POC) Early Release
Program. AFI 36-2013 (formerly AFR 53-20) governs these programs. Discharge airmen
contingent on their enlistment in the USAFR Obligated Reserve Section (ORS) to enter the
AFROTC-POC in contract status. See AFI 36-2011, Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps
(ROTC) (formerly AFR 45-48) for information about such enlistments. Airmen must show
evidence of acceptance for a specific AFROTC program.
 40                                                                    AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


      2.15.1. Discharge from active duty is NET 30 calendar days before class start date at the
      educational institution the airman will attend. Use Figure 3.1 for the format of the airman's
      request for separation. Make the discharge effective the day before the member enlists in the
      USAFR ORS. Do not deliver separation documents until after the enlistment in the USAFR
      ORS is complete. NOTE: For entering an officer training program with another armed
      service, see paragraph 3.7.
2.16. Insufficient Retainability for Permanent Change of Station (PCS). Separate PETS
airmen who are considered for PCS in a mandatory move status such as during base closure, unit
deactivation, or when it is determined to be in the best interest of the Air Force, and are found
ineligible because they have too little service retainability. Use this provision if they have less
than 12 months retainability and refuse to obtain the retainability or are ineligible to obtain
retainability for a PCS. If there are less than 30 days remaining until ETS, see paragraph 2.2.
      2.16.1. Members who have their ETS/DOS involuntarily adjusted due to High Year of
      Tenure or denial of reenlistment and who are otherwise eligible for separation pay (Chapter
      9) must be given an appropriate separation program designator (SPD) that will ensure
      payment.
2.17. Separation Authorized by HQ USAF. HQ USAF, Air Force Policy Division (DPXA)
may approve or direct the early separation of airmen. HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2 announces the
programs and gives the eligibility criteria and processing instructions. These separations include:
      2.17.1. General demobilization, reduction in strength, or by an order applicable to all the
      members of a group specified in the order.
      2.17.2. The early separation of members under various programs and circumstances.
      2.17.3. Other reasons approved by the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force.
2.18. Elimination from USAFA Preparatory School. For more information about elimination
from the USAFA preparatory school, see AFI 36-2021, Air Force Academy Preparatory School
(formerly AFR 53-14).
      2.18.1. Discharge Reserve members who enlisted specifically to attend the school.
   2.18.2. Release other Reserve members from active duty for return to ANGUS or USAFR.
2.19. Release from Void Enlistment. A person whose status or condition barred the creation of
a valid enlistment may be found to be serving in a void enlistment, if the condition still exists.
This includes, but is not limited to, persons who are legally insane, minors still under the legal
age for enlistment, or deserters from another service. For more information, see paragraph 5.13.
      2.19.1. The enlistment of a person who is under 17 years old is a nullity and is void from its
      inception. The base separation authority orders the release of a person under age 17 as soon
      as it is practical to do so after the facts of the case are known. The parent or guardian does
      not need to apply for release. For information about how to verify the airman's age, see
      paragraph 2.20.3.1
         2.19.1.1. If the member was under age 17 at the time of enlistment but is 17 years old at
         the time the facts become known, discharge for minority may be requested. For more
         information, see paragraph 2.20.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                         41


   2.19.2. When the evidence shows an enlistment may be void for a reason other than
   minority, send the case to HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2 for decision. Include a full report of the
   facts and circumstances. Act promptly in these cases to avoid retaining a person whose
   military status is void. The finding of a court-martial that it lacks jurisdiction because of a
   defective enlistment does not void the enlistment.
      2.19.2.1. Administrative action is necessary to find whether a specific enlistment is void,
      voidable, or valid. The evidence needed in these cases varies with the conditions
      involved. It must show how the creation of a valid enlistment was barred at the time it
      was attempted. There must also be evidence to show the condition is still present. For
      example, when sanity is at issue, the medical statements must address the person's mental
      competency at the present and at the time of enlistment.
   2.19.3. Neither indebtedness to the government nor civil confinement bars the release
   required under this provision. In absentia processing and release is authorized. For more
   information, see paragraph 1.12.
   2.19.4. Describe separation under this paragraph as a release from the custody and control of
   the Air Force.
2.20. Separation for Minority:
   2.20.1. A person under the age of 17 is serving in a void enlistment and must be separated
   according to paragraph 2.19.
   2.20.2. A member who is 17 years old is eligible for separation according to this paragraph if
   the parent or guardian did not give written consent to the enlistment; and applies for the
   member's discharge within 90 days of the enlistment.
   2.20.3. An application for separation under this paragraph must include evidence:
      2.20.3.1. Proving Age. This proof may be:
          2.20.3.1.1. An authenticated copy of a birth certificate;
          2.20.3.1.2. A statement from the State Registrar of Vital Statistics or a similar
          official charged with the responsibility for such records; or
          2.20.3.1.3. An affidavit of the parent or legal guardian. The affidavit must tell why
          the official record of birth cannot be obtained. It must be accompanied by a certified
          or authenticated record from the first school the airman attended and show the date of
          birth or age at the time of admission.
      2.20.3.2. Of Parental Custody. If the parents are legally separated or divorced, only the
      parent having custody or control may ask for separation; or
      2.20.3.3. Of Guardianship. A guardian's application for the separation of a member
      must include proof of guardianship. Usually, recognize only a guardian who has been
      officially appointed. However, in some cases, a person who supported a minor and acted
      as a guardian for some years after the parents' death need not have been officially
      appointed. Support this type of claim to guardianship by a notarized affidavit.

        2.20.3.4. Enlisted Under an Assumed Name. Identifying a member who enlisted under
        an assumed name with the person named on the record of birth. NOTE: Look carefully at
        birth certificates to make sure there are no alterations other than those made officially.
     2.20.4. If the conditions of paragraphs 2.20.2 and 2.20.3 are met, process the airman for
     discharge following the procedures in Chapter 6, Section 6B. If the separation authority
     finds the requirements of paragraphs 2.20.1 or 2.20.2 are met, discharge the airman except
     when retaining the member for the purposes of trial by court-martial. For more information
     about pending UCMJ action, see paragraph 1.9
     2.20.5. Usually, do not separate minors in the oversea area. Exceptions may be authorized if
     the place of entry was an oversea area and the separation takes place in the same area. For
     information about discharge in absentia, see paragraph 1.12.

I request that I be retained in the Air Force beyond, the expiration date of my term of

has been completed. I understand that my retention in the military service for this purpose
makes me subject to the obligations of military service in the same way and to the same

UCMJ. (NOTE: Prosecution in a foreign court is not a legal bar to a later prosecution in a
federal court based on the same act or omission. As a general rule, the Air Force does not
court-martial or punish under Article 15, UCMJ, members for substantially the same act
or omission for which a foreign court tried the member). I certify that this request for
retention in the service is not the result of coercion, force, or threat of harm. (See note
below.)

                                            Chapter 3

   VOLUNTARY SEPARATION PRIOR TO EXPIRATION OF TERM OF SERVICE
                             (PETS)

Section 3A—Processing Applications.

3.1. How Airmen Apply for PETS Separation. Airmen who want to leave the active service
of the Air Force PETS must ask for separation in writing. The MPF Personnel Relocation
Element helps them make the application. Each paragraph in this chapter authorizing separation
tells what is required to show a basis for separation exists. Follow the guidance in Figure 3.1, to
complete the application. Ensure all applicants read and understand the statement on AF Form
31, Part I, (Figure 3.1).
3.2. Action by the MPF. The MPF Personnel Relocation Element extracts information from
the personnel records and places it on the AF Form 31 to the unit commander. Add more
information, if required. Indicate on the form when an item is not applicable. This step is not
required when airmen separate early for Christmas.
3.3. Commander's Recommendation. The unit commander:
   3.3.1. Examines the case file (reference to AFI 36-2606, The Reenlistment, Retention, and
   NCO Status Program (formerly AFR 35-16) may be appropriate for selective reenlistment
   program (SRP) consideration);
   3.3.2. Recommends approval or disapproval;
   3.3.3. Gives the reasons if disapproval is recommended; and
   3.3.4. Sends the case through MPF Separations Unit to the separation authority.
3.4. Action by the Separation Authority. To find what action the separation authority may
take on an application, you must use Table 3.1. A disapproval must give rationale and return the
application to the airman with an explanation of the reason for disapproval.
3.5. Withdrawing Separation Applications. An airman who has submitted an application for
voluntary separation may ask the commander, in writing, to withdraw the application. The
separation authority approves or disapproves all requests for withdrawal, except for pregnancy or
child birth separations. When disapproval is recommended for pregnancy or child birth
separations, send the request and the recommendation to HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2 for decision.
   3.5.1. Discharge authorities may withdraw an approved voluntary separation that has not
   been executed when reasons exist that make withdrawal in the best interest of the Air Force.
   The separation authority must give written notification giving reason(s) for withdrawal to the
   member and the MPF separations section.
3.6. Type of Separation. Characterize separation under this chapter as honorable, unless
paragraph 1.19 (Entry Level Separation) applies.

Section 3B—Reasons for Voluntary Convenience of the Government (COG) Separation.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                           47


3.7. Entering an Officer Training Program. Discharge airmen who are selected for officer
training with another armed service. (For airmen applying for discharge to enter an AFROTC
program, see paragraph 2.15) The training must lead to an appointment or a commission and
active service in the officer grade. This includes enlistment in the Reserve of another service for
enrollment in certain ROTC scholarship and 2-year nonscholarship programs. For more
information, see Title 10 U.S.C., Sections 2107 and 2104. Applications must include documents
confirming program participation. NOTE: Do not give the discharge documents to the member
until the oath of office or enlistment in the other armed service has been executed. This provision
does not apply to airmen who accept appointments to a service academy. Title 10 U.S.C. 516
provides that an enlistment is not terminated by acceptance of an appointment to a service
academy. Discharge occurs at ETS. The separation authority sends AF Form 31, with supporting
documentation to HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2 recommending approval or disapproval and why. If
approved, the discharge will be:
   3.7.1. Effective on the day before enlistment in the other service; and
   3.7.2. Contingent on such enlistment.
3.8. Early Release to Further Education. Separate airmen up to 90 calendar days PETS to
enter or return to school. Usually, the date of separation should not be more than 10 days before
the class start date. Airmen may apply any time during the last 9 months of their service.
Approve applications if the educational program meets the requirements in 3.8.1 and the airman
meets the eligibility criteria in 3.8.2 Disapprove applications if there are sound military reasons.
   3.8.1. Educational Program Requirements. Applicants must show they have been
   accepted for a full-time course of instruction in a recognized:
       3.8.1.1. Institution of higher education in a program leading to an associate, a
       baccalaureate, or a higher degree. This means the person must take the minimum number
       of credit hours for the semester, quarter, or term the school requires to be classified as a
       full-time student. It does not include night school. The institution must be accredited in
       the Education Directory of Colleges and Universities published by the Department of
       Education. The Superintendent of Documents, US Government Printing Office,
       Washington DC 20402-1575, sells copies of the directory.
       3.8.1.2. Vocational or technical school in a course that will start with a specific school
       term and last at least 3 months. Attendance at night school does not qualify. The school
       must be approved by the appropriate State Board for Vocational Education; or, it must be
       accredited by one of the following:
           3.8.1.2.1. Accrediting Commission for Business Schools.
           3.8.1.2.2. National Association for Practical Nurse Education and Service,
           Incorporated.
           3.8.1.2.3. National League for Nursing, Incorporated.
           3.8.1.2.4. National Association of Trade and Technical Schools.
           3.8.1.2.5. Committee on Occupational Education of the Southern Association of
           Colleges and Schools.
 48                                                                      AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


   3.8.2. Eligibility Criteria. ANGUS and USAFR members ordered to active duty for
   training, for unsatisfactory participation in a Reserve assignment, or as AFROTC contract
   violators are not eligible for separation under this provision. Other airmen are eligible if they:
         3.8.2.1. Have been accepted for a program and meet the requirements of 3.8.1.1 or
         3.8.1.2.
         3.8.2.2. Show that entry in the specific school term for which they have been accepted is
         academically the best time to enter or return to school and that completion of required
         service will cause a hardship.
         3.8.2.3. Have paid, or show they are able to pay, entry fees.
3.9. Medical Education. Airmen may request separation under this provision to enter
accredited schools for training as physicians, dentists, osteopaths, veterinarians, optometrists, or
clinical psychologists.
      3.9.1. The application must show the airman has:
         3.9.1.1. Completed the required undergraduate training.
         3.9.1.2. Completed a minimum of 2 years of active military service.
         3.9.1.3. Been accepted for entry into a specific program at an accredited institution.
         3.9.1.4. Paid the entrance fee or received a waiver of this requirement.
   3.9.2. Applicants:
         3.9.2.1. May request a separation date no more than 30 days before the date classes will
         start. Usually, the requested date of separation should not be more than 10 days before
         the class start date.
         3.9.2.2. Must acknowledge, in writing, that if they fail to enter the course of study, their
         separation may be revoked, and the member may be recalled to active duty for
         disciplinary action. See paragraph 1.13.
3.10. Elimination from Officer Training School (OTS). For information about elimination
from OTS, see AFI 36-2013 (formerly AFR 53-27). Discharge airmen if they:
   3.10.1. Request discharge at the time of their elimination; and
   3.10.2. Were enlisted specifically for OTS.
3.11. Air Force Nonfulfillment of Enlistment or Reenlistment Agreement. If the Air Force
fails to fulfill its commitments recorded on enlistment/reenlistment agreements, the member may
be separated.
   3.11.1. When to Apply for Discharge. Airmen must apply for discharge within 30 days
   after notification of an assignment, reassignment, classification, reclassification, or other
   action that violates their agreement with the Air Force. If they fail to do so, they waive
   entitlement to this provision.
         3.11.1.1. Requesting Separation. Include in the request for discharge copies of the:
         3.11.1.2. Documents that show the enlistment or reenlistment agreements; and
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                         49


       3.11.1.3. Correspondence showing the alleged failure of the Air Force to meet the terms
       of the enlistment or reenlistment agreement that have not been changed by supplements
       to it
3.12. Sole Surviving Son or Daughter. Do not separate under this provision during a period of
war or national emergency declared by the United States Congress. NOTE: Airmen may acquire
and retain sole surviving son or daughter status even if there are no other living family members.
It does not depend on the existence of a family unit. A sole surviving daughter may have living
brothers, and a sole surviving son may have living sisters.
   3.12.1. A sole surviving son or daughter is the only remaining son or daughter in a family
   where the father, mother, or one or more sons, or one or more daughters:
       3.12.1.1. Was killed in action or died as a result of wounds, accident, or disease incurred
       in line of duty while serving in the Armed Forces.
       3.12.1.2. Is in a captured or missing in action status; or
       3.12.1.3. Is permanently 100 percent disabled, physically or mentally, as determined by
       the Veterans' Administration or one of the military departments, and is hospitalized on a
       continuing basis and is not gainfully employed due to such disability.
   3.12.2. Discharge an airman who becomes a sole surviving son or daughter (paragraph
   3.12.1) after enlistment on request, unless the airman:
       3.12.2.1. Has waived the right to discharge either automatically (paragraph 3.12.3) or in
       writing; or
       3.12.2.2. Is the subject of incomplete action by court-martial. Process the request for
       administrative discharge but do not discharge, until the court-martial action is complete.
       For more information, see paragraph 1.9.
       3.12.2.3. Is being processed for involuntary administrative separation for cause.
   3.12.3. If airmen are told of the paragraph 3.12.2 criteria but enlist (in another service),
   reenlist, or extend their periods of active service in any way, they waive the right to this
   discharge provision.
   3.12.4. A member who has waived his or her right to separation as provided in paragraphs
   3.12.2 and 3.12.3, may request reinstatement of that status at any time. Consider requests for
   reinstatement on a case by case basis for merit.
3.13. Early Release from Extension. When airmen extend their enlistments, they obligate
themselves to serve the full term of the extension. For more information, see AFI 36-2606
(formerly AFR 35-16, volume 1). However, they may still separate PETS under any provision of
this chapter, if they qualify. They may ask for early release from an extension when:
   3.13.1. It would be unjust to force airmen to serve the extension because the Air Force,
   through no fault of the airmen, could not keep the agreement on which the extension was
   based.
   3.13.2. Early separation would serve the best interest of both airmen and the Air Force.
 50                                                                      AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


3.14. Accepting Public Office. For more information about how airmen qualify for separation
under this provision, see AFI 52-902, Political Activities of Members of the Air Force (formerly
AFR 110-2).
   3.14.1. An airman may qualify for separation by:
       3.14.1.1. Election as a partisan candidate to any civil office.
       3.14.1.2. Election as a nonpartisan candidate to a civil office requiring full-time service.
       3.14.1.3. Appointment to a civil office requiring full-time service.
   3.14.2. Qualified airmen may be separated under this provision if they are not:
       3.14.2.1. Members of the Regular Air Force serving on their first enlistments.
       3.14.2.2. USAFR members serving on initial periods of active duty longer than 30 days.
       3.14.2.3. Regular or Reserve members who have active duty service commitments
       (ADSC) based on formal training or other education wholly or partly at the expense of
       the government.
3.15. Miscellaneous Reasons. Airmen who do not qualify for separation for another reason
may ask for separation under this provision. As a rule, approve applications when the airman's
early separation will serve the best interest of the Air Force. Usually the requested date of
separation should be no less than 2 or more than 12 months from the date of the application.
   3.15.1. PALACE CHASE Consideration. CONUS-based airmen must first apply for
   PALACE CHASE separation if:
       3.15.1.1. The requested DOS is more than 12 months before the current DOS.
       3.15.1.2. The eligibility criteria for PALACE CHASE separation are met. For more
       information, see paragraph 2.14 and AFI 36-3205 (formerly AFR 35-46).
   3.15.2. Evaluating the Application. Each application is evaluated on its own merits. This
   includes consideration of the:
       3.15.2.1. Reason for separation and the supporting documents, if any.
       3.15.2.2. Other factors that may have a bearing on the case.
       3.15.2.3. Length of service since completion of the last training or PCS.
       3.15.2.4. Pending assignment, if any.
       3.15.2.5. Current and projected manning in the AFSC.
       3.15.2.6. Retraining potential.
   3.15.3. Action by the Separation Authority. The separation authority:
       3.15.3.1. Finally approves applications with merit for airmen assigned in the CONUS
       when requested DOS is within 12 months of the member's normal DOS. Approved DOS
       must be consistent with member's requested date.
       3.15.3.2. Finally disapproves applications found to lack merit. When final approval
       authority is HQ AFMPC/ DPMARS2 update PTI 970 after the Separation authority has
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                           51


       indorsed the application with a recommendation for approval. Include in the AMU trailor
       remarks the following:
       3.15.3.3. Squadron commander and separation authority recommendation and brief
       explanation of individual's reason for separation.
       3.15.3.4. In cases of unusual circumstances, mail a copy of the application to HQ
       AFMPC/ DPMARS2, Randolph AFB TX 78150-6001 and indicate in the AMU remarks
       that the application has been forwarded and the date forwarded.
       3.15.3.5. Is ineligible for PALACE CHASE, and if so, why; or
       3.15.3.6. Has been disapproved for PALACE CHASE separation in the last 120 calendar
       days.
       3.15.3.7. Do not update PTI 970 if the Base separation authority has disapproved
       application.
3.16. Conscientious Objection. Airmen apply for discharge under this paragraph when they
ask for conscientious objector status under AFI 36-3204, Disposition of Conscientious Objectors
(formerly AFR 35-24). HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2 may direct the discharge of airmen found to be
class 1-A-0 conscientious objectors if they cannot be used effectively as noncombatants.
3.17. Pregnancy or Childbirth. Women may find pregnancy and the expectation of
motherhood incompatible with continued military service. If so, they may ask for separation. If
they are separated, they are entitled to maternity care only in a military medical facility, on a
space available basis (AFI 41-115 (formerly AFR 168-6)). Members who were pregnant at the
time of enlistment or entry into active service are not eligible for separation under this paragraph
and are not entitled to maternity care in military facilities after their separation. They are not
physically qualified for enlistment and are subject to discharge for erroneous enlistment
(paragraph 5.14).
   3.17.1. Requests for separation for pregnancy must:
       3.17.1.1. Be supported by an AF Form 422, Physical Profile Serial Report, confirming
       the pregnancy. It must be signed by a designated profiling officer. Another document
       giving the same information, DA Form 3349, Medical Condition-Physical Profile
       Record, for example, may be substituted for the AF Form 422.
       3.17.1.2. Give a preferred date of separation that is earlier than the anticipated date of
       delivery.
       3.17.1.3. Acknowledge the understanding that, if the application is approved, the
       separation authority will set the separation date.
       3.17.1.4. Tell whether discharge or release from active duty is requested, if the member
       has an unfulfilled MSO and is qualified for transfer to the USAFR.
   3.17.2. If the immediate commander recommends approval for separation, there must be a
   further recommendation as to the DOS. Approval for the requested date, a later date, or an
   earlier one may be recommended. In making this recommendation, the commander will look
   at the impact of the member's loss to the duty section and consider whether she can be
   effectively employed during her pregnancy.
 52                                                                     AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


      3.17.3. The separation authority may take one of these actions:
         3.17.3.1. Approve the separation for the date requested.
         3.17.3.2. Approve the separation for a later date, usually one that is at least 60 days
         before the date of confinement.
         3.17.3.3. Approve the separation for a date before the requested one. In such a case, the
         separation date must be at least 30 days after the airman is notified of the separation
         authority's decision.
         3.17.3.4. Direct that action on the request for discharge for pregnancy be discontinued,
         and return the case to the unit commander for more appropriate action; for example,
         involuntary discharge according to Chapter 5.
         3.17.3.5. Recommend disapproval and forward the case to HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2 for
         decision.
      3.17.4. In some cases, pregnancy may be terminated after separation is approved but before
      it takes place. If the pregnancy is terminated:
         3.17.4.1. By the birth of a living child, the approved discharge will be executed as soon
         as the member is medically qualified for separation.
         3.17.4.2. Other than by the birth of a living child, the member may separate as scheduled
         or request withdrawal of her application. The separation authority may approve the
         request for withdrawal or recommend disapproval and refer it to HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2
         for final action.
3.18. Early Release for Christmas. An airman whose established date of separation falls on or
after 9 December, and before 8 January the following year, may ask for separation any time
during that period. The requested DOS must be earlier than the established DOS. The base
separation authority may deny the request of an eligible airman (paragraph 3.18.1) only if the
early loss of the member would have a critical and adverse impact on the unit's mission
capability. Place the written request for early separation in the FRGp for retention.
      3.18.1. Airmen Excluded. Airmen are not eligible for early release under this provision if
      they are:
         3.18.1.1. ANGUS or USAFR airmen serving on initial active duty for training (IADT),
         active duty for training (ADT), or involuntary EAD tours.
         3.18.1.2. In a formal probation or rehabilitation program.
         3.18.1.3. Being processed for involuntary discharge.
         3.18.1.4. Under investigation or on international hold.
         3.18.1.5. Awaiting trial, the result of trial, or the outcome of the appellate review of a
         conviction by court-martial.
         3.18.1.6. Separating under the PALACE CHASE program.
      3.18.2. Oversea Returnees. Airmen scheduled for separation in the United States for lack
      of retainability for reassignment are eligible, if the scheduled return date falls within the
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                            53


   period. Members returning for ETS separation within 30 days of ETS (paragraph 2.2.1) are
   also eligible.
   3.18.3. Airmen Scheduled for PETS Separation. Airmen approved for PETS separation
   are eligible for earlier release under this provision, if the adjusted DOS falls within the
   period. Further adjustment of the DOS under this provision does not change the authority for
   separation.
   3.18.4. ETS Separation. If this provision is the only reason for adjusting an airman's ETS
   separation date, cite it as the authority for the separation.
3.19. Medal of Honor. A member who is the recipient of the Medal of Honor may request
separation at anytime. The member is normally separated on the date requested.

Section 3C—Dependency or Hardship.

3.20. Conditions for Discharge. Airmen may request discharge when genuine dependency or
undue hardship exists.
   3.20.1. A basis for discharge may exist when:
       3.20.1.1. The dependency or hardship is not temporary.
       3.20.1.2. Conditions have arisen or have been aggravated to an excessive degree since
       the airman entered active duty.
       3.20.1.3. The airman has made every reasonable effort to remedy the situation.
       3.20.1.4. Separation will eliminate or materially alleviate the conditions.
       3.20.1.5. There are no means of alleviation readily available other than the separation.
   3.20.2. Undue hardship or dependency does not necessarily exist because:
       3.20.2.1. Of altered present or expected income; or
       3.20.2.2. The family is separated or must suffer the inconveniences usually incident to
       military service.
3.21. Evidence Required. MPF personnel counsel airmen about the conditions for, and
evidence needed to support separation for hardship or dependency. Written statements of the
facts of the case support the application for discharge. The original, signed statements must
accompany the application.
   3.21.1. In some cases, specific types of statements are required. If the application is based on
   a condition that is:
       3.21.1.1. Due to the death of family member, a death certificate or other proof of death is
       required.
       3.21.1.2. Caused by the disability of a family member, a physician's statement must tell
       what the disability is and when it occurred.
       3.21.1.3. Basically a financial hardship, there must be evidence of prospective civilian
       employment with income that would exceed the member's military pay.
   3.21.2. In all cases, the application should:
 54                                                                    AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


         3.21.2.1. State specifically the hardship or dependency condition.
         3.21.2.2. Give specific dates of events.
         3.21.2.3. List other family members with their ages, occupations, incomes, and locations.
         3.21.2.4. Tell why the other family members cannot give the care or support needed
3.22. Red Cross Assistance. On request, the American Red Cross helps get, or verify,
information about circumstances that may be a basis for discharge for hardship or dependency.
      3.22.1. The Separation Authority. If it seems that an application should be approved, but
      more information is needed, the separation authority asks the local Red Cross representative
      to get it. The request gives the airman's name and home address with a summary of the
      evidence or statements submitted with the application. Limit the request to the facts needed
      to act on the case.
      3.22.2. Airmen or their Dependents. Airmen or their dependents may ask local Red Cross
      chapters to help them get evidence they need to support an application for discharge. In these
      cases, the Red Cross does not make a formal report to the Air Force, unless it is requested
      (paragraph 3.22.1). NOTE: For more information about help from the Red Cross, see AFI
      36-3105, Red Cross (formerly AFR 211-11).
3.23. Special Procedures and Considerations:
      3.23.1. For information about where airmen apply for discharge under this section, see
      Table 3.2.
      3.23.2. Process applications for discharge under this provision quickly. Give them priority.
      Commanders, MPF personnel, and other agencies must provide maximum assistance to the
      member.
      3.23.3. If the case is not complete, help the airman get what it lacks. For information about
      Red Cross assistance, see paragraph 3.22.
      3.23.4. Do not delay or disapprove discharge for dependency or hardship because the
      airman's services are needed in the organization. Indebtedness to the government is not a bar
      to separation.
      3.23.5. If the airman is under court-martial charges or investigation that may result in the
      preferring of charges, an application for discharge under this section may be processed. If it
      is approved, the airman may not be discharged while the investigation or charges are pending
      except as provided in paragraph 1.9.
      3.23.6. An application for discharge may show the airman had dependents who were not
      acknowledged at the time of enlistment. If so, consider the possibility of discharge for
      fraudulent or erroneous enlistment. The fraud or error may be waived to permit discharge
      under this section.
      3.23.7. If a request for discharge is received from an airman's family, counsel the airman
      about how to apply for discharge. Do not approve a discharge until the member has applied
      in writing.
      3.23.8. Airmen separated for hardship or dependency are discharged.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                       55


   3.23.9. AFI 36-2002 restricts enlistment of prior service persons last discharged for
   dependency or hardship. Counsel the applicant about this restriction, get a signed statement
   reflecting understanding of the policy, and add it to the case file.
3.24. Final Action on Applications. The separation authority:
   3.24.1. Approves the application and notifies the airman promptly; or
   3.24.2. Disapproves the application and requires an officer or a noncommissioned officer in
   the MPF who understands separation policy to:
       3.24.2.1. Return the application to the airman;
       3.24.2.2. Explain how it was processed and why it was disapproved;
       3.24.2.3. Counsel the airman about other available alternatives such as application for
       separation for other reasons; and
       3.24.2.4. Ensure the airman's understanding that a new application may be submitted if
       the circumstances change. In such a case, new supporting evidence would be required.
3.25. Applications Submitted at Other Than the Base of Assignment. MPFs give extra help
to airmen who apply for discharge while they are on leave or enroute PCS. The MPF that
processes the application (Table 3.2):
   3.25.1. Asks the applicant's commander to grant an extension of leave, if more time is
   needed for processing.
   3.25.2. Communicates with the aerial port, if a port call must be changed or cancelled.
   3.25.3. If the separation authority decides that the application warrants approval, sends a
   message (includes minimize) to the member's servicing MPF (use Figure 3.2 for personnel
   on leave or TDY and Figure 3.3 for personnel enroute to PCS). The servicing MPF will
   determine if there are any actions pending or reasons that would preclude approval and
   execution of the member's hardship discharge. If there are none, the servicing MPF will
   immediately reassign the member PCS without permanent change of assignment (PCA) for
   separation and furnish the processing MPF the special order number by return message.

                                            Chapter 4

       REQUEST FOR DISCHARGE IN LIEU OF TRIAL BY COURT-MARTIAL

4.1. Basis for Discharge:
   4.1.1. Airmen may be discharged under this provision if they:
       4.1.1.1. Are subject to trial by court-martial; and
       4.1.1.2. Request discharge in lieu of trial.
   4.1.2. Airmen may request discharge if charges have been preferred with respect to an
   offense for which a punitive discharge is authorized. If Rule 1003(d)3, Manual for Courts-
   Martial (MCM), 1984, is the sole basis for a punitive discharge, they may not request
   discharge in lieu of trial unless the charges have been referred to a court-martial empowered
   to adjudge a punitive discharge.
4.2. Types of Discharge Authorized. The fact that a member is triable for an offense for which
a court-martial could adjudge a punitive discharge reflects the serious nature of the conduct.
Generally, characterize the service of airmen discharged under this provision as under other than
honorable conditions; however, if the charges are referred to a summary court-martial and the
member requests discharge in lieu of trial by summary court-martial, the member's service may
not be characterized as under other than honorable conditions unless such characterization is
approved by the Secretary of the Air Force. For guidance in determining the type of separation,
see Chapter 1, Section 1B.
   4.2.1. If the airman is in entry level status, and discharge under other than honorable
   conditions is not warranted, the separation will be described as an entry level separation.
   4.2.2. For other airmen, the separation may be characterized as:
       4.2.2.1. Under Honorable Conditions (General), when such a characterization is
       warranted under the guidelines in Chapter 1, Section 1B; or
       4.2.2.2. Honorable, only if the member's record has been so meritorious that any other
       service characterization would be inappropriate.
4.3. How Airmen Request Discharge in Lieu of Trial:
   4.3.1. Airmen applying for discharge in lieu of trial by court-martial must acknowledge
   understanding of:
       4.3.1.1. The elements of the offense or offenses charged;
       4.3.1.2. The fact that a summary court-martial cannot impose a punitive discharge
       (Required only if charges are or will referred to a summary court-martial).
       4.3.1.3. The fact that characterization of service as under other than honorable conditions
       is authorized; and
       4.3.1.4. The adverse nature of such a characterization and the possible consequences.
       4.3.1.5. The fact that any special pay, bonuses, and education assistance funds, may be
       subject to recoupment.
 60                                                                    AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


      4.3.2. Submit applications to the unit commander for discharge in lieu of trial by court-
      martial. Applications may be submitted anytime after the criteria in paragraph 4.1 are met.
      For more information about how the request for discharge affects the trial by court-martial,
      see Table 4.1.
      4.3.3. Before they apply for discharge under this provision, airmen must be given an
      opportunity to consult legal counsel. If an airman refuses to consult counsel, the appointed
      counsel prepares a statement to this effect and adds it to the case file. The member's
      application will then include a statement that the right to consult counsel has been waived.
      Statements the member or counsel for the member make in connection with a request for
      discharge under this chapter are not admissible in courts-martial except as authorized by
      MCM, Military Rule of Evidence 410.
      4.3.4. For a format of the application, use Figure 4.1.
4.4. Processing the Request for Discharge:
   4.4.1. Action by the Unit Commander. Send the application through the MPF to the
   Special Court-Martial (SPCM) authority recommending approval or disapproval. For a
   format of the letter, use Figure 4.2. It must include information for use in determining how
   the service should be described or characterized. Attach copies of the charge sheet,
   investigation reports, statements, and legal reviews.
         4.4.1.1. Notify the local Finance Service Office (FSO), in writing, as soon as the
         discharge is initiated. Request the FSO to notify you if member is indebted to the
         government and what action will be taken to collect the debt. Use AFI 35-2102,
         Preparation of Personnel Selected for Relocation - Base Level Procedures (formerly
         AFR 35-17), to find an example, to notify local base agencies of discharge initiation. If
         disapproved, re-notify appropriate agencies.
   4.4.2. Action by the SPCM Authority. The SPCM authority personally acts on these cases.
   Authority may not be delegated. Recommendations for approval sent to the GCM authority
   must include a recommendation as to the type of separation. Include specific reason for the
   recommendation if the type recommended is not under other than honorable conditions.
         4.4.2.1. If the Article 32, UCMJ, investigation has been forwarded to the GCM authority,
         the SPCM authority sends the case to the GCM authority recommending approval or
         disapproval.
         4.4.2.2. If the Article 32, UCMJ, investigation has not been forwarded to the GCM

         AFMPC/DPMARS2. HQ AFMPC/ DPMARS2 refers the request for approval of a
         UOTHC to the office of the Secretary of the Air Force for decision. The request must
         include:
             4.8.4.1.1. A complete review of the facts in the case.

             could not impose a punitive discharge.
             4.8.4.1.4. An explanation why a UOTHC is warranted.
4.9. Additional Misconduct. After forwarding the case, additional misconduct may occur or be
discovered. If this happens, the commander reports the misconduct to the SPCM authority at
once. If the case has been sent to the GCM authority according to paragraph 4.4, the SPCM
authority sends the report to the GCM authority immediately. The SPCM authority tells the
GCM authority if, due to the additional misconduct, there is a change in the previous
recommendation.
   4.9.1. If the case has been sent to HQ AFMPC/ DPMARS2 according to paragraph 4.8.3,
   the GCM authority immediately sends the report to HQ AFMPC/ DPMARS2 and tells that
   office whether the recommended disposition has changed. The report must be given as fast as
   possible. It can be made by telephone and confirmed by message or letter. Be sure the parent
   organization gets copies if paragraph 4.6 applies.
4.10. Withdrawal of Request for Discharge. An airman may ask to do this any time before
the decision of the GCM or SAF authority. The unit commander sends the request to the SPCM
authority through the MPF Personnel Relocation Element to be referred to the GCM or SAF
authority for final approval or disapproval. Both the unit commander and SPCM authority give
their recommendations in the forwarding correspondence. The GCM authority adds his or her
recommendation to cases being referred to SAF.
4.11. Who Can Approve Discharge. The GCM authority personally takes final action on
requests for discharge in lieu of trial by court-martial, except in cases where the charges were
referred to a summary court-martial and the GCM authority wishes to seek SAF approval of a
UOTHC. For retirement eligible and lengthy service cases, see paragraph 4.8.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                         63


4.12. Action by the GCM Authority. The SJA for the GCM authority reviews the case for
legal sufficiency before the GCM authority acts on it. The legal review is made a part of the case
file. The guidelines in paragraph 6.1 apply to consideration of the airman's qualification for
further service.
     4.12.1. If the charges have not been referred to a summary court-marital and the GCM
     authority approves the request for discharge, he or she:
        4.12.1.1. Determines the type of discharge to be issued.
        4.12.1.2. Gives the reason for the service characterization directed, if it is:
            4.12.1.2.1. Not under other than honorable conditions; or
            4.12.1.2.2. Less favorable than the type recommended by the commander.
     4.12.2. If the GCM authority disapproves the request for discharge, he or she:
        4.12.2.1. Returns the case to the SPCM authority with appropriate comments.
        4.12.2.2. Gives disposition instructions separately.
     4.12.3. If the charges have been referred to a summary court-martial and the GCM authority
     determines a UOTHC characterization is warranted, he or she:
        4.12.3.1. Processes the case in accordance with paragraph 4.8.4.
     4.12.4. If the charges have been referred to a summary court-martial and the GCM authority
     determines a UOTHC is not warranted, he or she:
        4.12.4.1. Approves the request and determines whether service characterization will be
        honorable or under honorable conditions (general).

                                              Chapter 5

                       REASONS FOR INVOLUNTARY SEPARATION

Section 5A—Preprocessing Considerations.

5.1. Choosing a Course of Action:
      5.1.1. Commanders and supervisors identify airmen who show a likelihood for early
      separation. They should make reasonable efforts to help these airmen meet Air Force
      standards. Airmen who do not show a potential for further service should be discharged.
      5.1.2. Involuntary administrative discharge is not a substitute for disciplinary action. The
      commander should consult the staff judge advocate and MPF when choosing a course of
      action.
      5.1.3. For limitations on using certain information in administrative discharge action, see
      paragraph 5.4.
      5.1.4. Refer to paragraph 1.8 before starting discharge action for a member who has, or
      once had, access to SCI or other special access programs.
      5.1.5. Airmen recommended for administrative discharge for cause do not have a right to be
      tried by court-martial instead. They may not ask for discharge processing according to a
      specific provision of this chapter. The commander chooses the course of action to be pursued
      subject to the concurrence of the convening authority.
      5.1.6. To find whether an airman recommended for discharge under this chapter must be
      offered a board hearing, see paragraph 6.2 Use the procedure in Chapter 6, Section 6C, if
      the member is entitled to a board hearing. Process other cases by notification according to
      Chapter 6, Section 6B.
   5.1.7. Refer to AFI 36-2104, Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability Program (formerly
   AFR 35-99), concerning personnel reliability program (PRP) members being discharged for
   cause and the need to be permanently decertified from PRP duties prior to discharge.
   5.1.8. When an airman is convicted by a court-martial and does not receive a punitive
   discharge, consider initiating involuntary separation (paragraphs 6.9.12 and 6.14.14).
5.2. Preprocessing Rehabilitation. Airmen should have an opportunity to overcome their
deficiencies before discharge action starts. A commander's effort to rehabilitate the airman may
include formal or informal counseling, control roster action, punishment under Article 15,
UCMJ, a change in duty assignment, demotion, additional training or duty, retraining, or other
administrative actions. Commanders should keep a record of these actions.
   5.2.1. Airmen must be counseled formally concerning their deficiencies and given an
   opportunity to overcome them before a commander recommends discharge for:
         5.2.1.1. Parenthood, according to paragraph 5.9.2.
         5.2.1.2. Conditions that interfere with military service.
         5.2.1.3. Entry level performance and conduct.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                             69


       5.2.1.4. Unsatisfactory performance.
       5.2.1.5. Minor disciplinary infractions.
       5.2.1.6. A pattern of misconduct.
   5.2.2. For more information about drug or alcohol abuse rehabilitation, see AFI 36-2701,
   Social Action Program (formerly AFR 30-2). Airmen must have been referred to such a
   program before they are processed for discharge under Section 5F.
   5.2.3. An alleged or established inadequacy in previous rehabilitative effort does not provide
   a bar to separation.
5.3. Determining the Basis of the Action:
   5.3.1. As a rule, one or more acts or conditions on which a recommendation for discharge is
   based will have occurred or existed in the current enlistment. However, one or more acts or
   conditions on which the discharge recommendation is based may have occurred or existed:
       5.3.1.1. Before entry, if the reason for discharge is fraudulent or erroneous enlistment.
       5.3.1.2. Before entry, or in any previous enlistment, if the reason for discharge is in the
       interest of national security.
   5.3.2. During the enlistment immediately preceding the current term of service if:
       5.3.2.1. The member's reenlistment immediately followed discharge from the previous
       enlistment (no break in service), and
       5.3.2.2. The unit commander did not have actual knowledge of the facts or circumstances
       pertaining to the one or more acts or conditions until after the member reenlisted.
       5.3.2.3. When a member is being separated for failure in the fitness program and has had
       at least one instance of unsatisfactory progress in the program during the current
       enlistment, commanders may use instances of unsatisfactory progress in the immediately
       preceding enlistment to establish a basis for separation. NOTE: See paragraphs 1.20
       and 1.21 concerning information to be considered on this issue of service
       characterization.
   5.3.3. If the requirements in paragraph 5.3.1 are met, the entire military record may be
   considered in deciding whether the member should be discharged or retained.
   5.3.4. Commanders must look carefully at all the facts to be sure they recommend discharge
   for the right reason. For example, an airman whose conduct and duty performance have been
   unsatisfactory (Section 5E) may also have failed in drug or alcohol abuse treatment (Section
   5F) or have a record of minor disciplinary infractions (Section 5H). As a rule, it is best to
   base the recommendation on the one reason the record most completely supports. Consult the
   MPF and SJA for assistance.
   5.3.5. In some cases, it will be preferable to cite two or more reasons as the basis for the
   discharge recommendation. If one reason cited in the letter of notification entitles the
   member to a board hearing, process the entire matter according to Chapter 6, Section 6C.
   For special instructions applicable to cases based on more than one reason, see Chapter 6,
   Section 6H.
 70                                                                     AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


5.4. Limitations on Discharge Action. A member may not be discharged administratively
based on conduct that has been the subject of:
      5.4.1. Judicial proceedings, military or civilian, resulting in acquittal or action having the
      effect thereof unless:
         5.4.1.1. Such action is based on a judicial determination not going to the guilt or
         innocence of the respondent; or
         5.4.1.2. The judicial proceeding was conducted in a state or foreign court, and the
         discharge is approved by the Secretary of the Air Force. For more information about
         processing, see paragraph 1.2.
         5.4.1.3. The acquittal from the judicial proceedings was based on a finding of not guilty
         only by reason of lack of mental responsibility. Members in this category can be
         separated under paragraph 1.2 unless separation for disability is appropriate.
      5.4.2. A prior board hearing in which the board entered an approved finding that the
      evidence did not sustain the factual allegations concerning the conduct. EXCEPTION: This
      limitation does not apply when the conduct is the subject of a rehearing in a case involving
      fraud or collusion. Use Table 6.3 in this instance.
      5.4.3. Administrative discharge processing resulting in retention except when:
         5.4.3.1. The new proceeding is based, in whole or in part, on subsequent conduct or
         performance;
         5.4.3.2. There is new, or newly discovered, evidence that was not reasonably available at
         the time of the prior proceeding; or
         5.4.3.3. The conduct is the subject of a new hearing ordered on the basis of fraud or
         collusion in the prior hearing.
      5.4.4. An approved waiver of the option to discharge for civil court conviction or defective
      enlistment.
      5.4.5. Information obtained during, or as a result of, an epidemiologic assessment interview
      or results obtained from laboratory tests for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (see
      paragraph 5.53). Any information disclosed by an airman during or as a result of an
      epidemiologic assessment interview may not be used to initiate administrative discharge
      action against the airman.
         5.4.5.1. The limitation on use of information obtained from the member does not apply
         to the introduction of evidence for impeachment or rebuttal purposes in any
         administrative discharge proceeding in which the evidence of drug abuse or relevant
         sexual activity (or lack thereof) has been first introduced by the member.
         5.4.5.2. Also, these limitations do not preclude administrative discharge action based
         upon evidence derived independently of the epidemiological assessment interview.
         Results obtained from laboratory tests for HIV may not, by itself, be the basis for
         involuntary separation of the airman under this regulation.
         5.4.5.3. For disability processing, see AFI 36-2902.
5.5. Airmen in TDY Status:
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                       71


   5.5.1. Do not start involuntary discharge action against an airman in TDY status. End the
   TDY and return the airman to the unit of assignment. Send the commander a full report of the
   facts of the case. Include all available documentation. EXCEPTION: Process the
   recommendation for discharge at the TDY base if the respondent is TDY with the unit of
   assignment.
   5.5.2. Refer to AFI 36-2110, Assignments (formerly AFR 39-11) if it appears that the airman
   in TDY status should be reassigned for administrative discharge processing. Reassignment
   may be possible for airmen who have not completed initial training or those who are enroute
   to or from oversea assignments. Do not start discharge processing until the airman is
   assigned to a unit under the jurisdiction of SPCM authority.
   5.5.3. For non-prior service (NPS) airmen who are enroute for training and the unit
   commander at the TDY location determines the NPS airman should be processed for an
   administrative discharge, and then the member is assigned to the TDY location in a PCS
   status as follows:
       5.5.3.1. The TDY separations element at the MPF requests the relocation element advise
       HQ AFPC/DPAAS3 by message or email: DPAAS3@randolph.af.mil that the member
       is to be processed for an administrative discharge and action is being taken to gain the
       member in PCS status to the TDY location (include in the message as an information
       addressee the gaining and losing MPFs, the gaining and losing MAJCOM).
       5.5.3.2. With concurrence of the separation authority, the MPF relocation element will
       use the unprojected gain procedure prescribed in AFCSM 36-699, Volume 1, Personnel
       Data Systems End Users Manual, to effect the assignment. The assignment gain action
       will cancel the projected assignment.
       5.5.3.3. The TDY location MPF will amend the member’s PCS orders to reflect the
       change in permanent duty station and include in the remarks section of the order that the
       change in assignment is for the purpose of involuntary administrative discharge
       processing.
5.6. Reassignment for Processing. Airmen will not be reassigned from one unit to another on
the same base for discharge processing. For information about when they may be reassigned PCS
for execution of an approved discharge, see AFI 36-2110 (formerly AFR 39-11). If an airman
pending, or being considered for, discharge for cause is:
   5.6.1. Selected for reassignment by HQ AFMPC, Airman Assignments Division (DPMRA)
   without reference to the discharge action, the MPF notifies HQ AFMPC/DPMRA at once and
   stops reassignment processing until they get more instructions.
   5.6.2. Hospitalized, or needs to be hospitalized, the MPF gets HQ AFMPC/DPMRA
   approval before reassigning the airman. See AFIs 36-2110 (formerly AFR 39-11), AFI 41-
   115 (formerly AFR 160-2), and AFR 168-4 for more information.

Section 5B—Involuntary Convenience of the Government (COG) Discharge.

5.7. Instruction and Type of Separation. This discharge is appropriate when discharge would
serve the best interest of the Air Force and discharge for cause is not warranted. The general
guidelines for discharge or retention set out in paragraph 6.1 apply to these cases. The
 72                                                                      AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


separation of an airman in entry level status will be described as entry level separation. The
service of other airmen separated under this section will be characterized as honorable.
5.8. Preprocessing Actions. Before commanders recommend discharge for one of the reasons
in this section, they must look at all the facts of the case to be sure:
      5.8.1. The preprocessing rehabilitation requirements of paragraph 5.2 have been met;
      5.8.2. They have complied with all the requirements of the authorizing paragraph; and
      5.8.3. The circumstances do not warrant discharge for cause.
5.9. Parenthood. For Air Force policy concerning dependent care responsibilities see AFI 36-
2908, Dependents Care Responsibilities (formerly AFR 35-59). This policy applies to all
members with dependents. Airmen may be discharged under this provision if, because of
parental responsibilities, they fail to meet their military obligations.
      5.9.1. Airmen in Basic Military or Technical Training. Special dependent care
      arrangements are required of single member parents and military couples with dependents.
      At the time they enlist, single members who have minor dependents agree that their
      dependents will not accompany them during their initial training period.
         5.9.1.1. This restriction is contained in AFI 36-2002 (formerly AFR 33-3), and is agreed
         to by the applicant on AF Form 3010, Statement of Understanding, Dependent Care
         Responsibility/ Join Spouse Policy, United States Air Force, at the time of enlistment.
         Violation of this agreement during basic military or initial technical training makes
         airmen subject to discharge under this provision.
      5.9.2. Other Airmen. Other airmen are subject to discharge under this provision if they are,
      as a result of parenthood:
         5.9.2.1. Unable to perform their duties satisfactorily.
         5.9.2.2. Unavailable for worldwide assignment or deployment.
      5.9.3. Preprocessing Actions. Commanders must comply with the counseling and remedial
      actions required by AFI 36-2908 (formerly AFR 35-59) before they recommend discharge
      under paragraph 5.9.2 The record of these actions should be part of the case file.
5.10. Insufficient Retainability for Required Retraining:
      5.10.1. Criteria. The cost of retraining airmen for a brief period of service may not warrant
      their retention. Consider airmen for discharge if they:
         5.10.1.1. Have been disqualified for duty in all awarded AFSCs.
         5.10.1.2. Are serving overseas in a CONUS or an oversea imbalance skill and are not
         qualified for duty in another AFSC on return to CONUS.
      5.10.2. Eligibility. Airmen are eligible for discharge under this provision if they:
         5.10.2.1. Are serving in their first Air Force enlistment;
         5.10.2.2. Have served at least 36 months on a 4-year enlistment or 60 months on a 6-year
         enlistment; and
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                          73


       5.10.2.3. Have been screened under the SRP but have not been selected for reenlistment;
       or are serving in the grade of airman first class and are not recommended for promotion;
       or have rendered themselves ineligible to reenlist.
   5.10.3. Processing. The unit commander's recommendation for discharge must:
       5.10.3.1. Tell how the airman qualifies for discharge under paragraph 5.10.1 or 5.10.2
       and comment on retraining options.
       5.10.3.2. Include documents showing how the requirements of paragraph 5.10.2 are
       met.
   5.10.4. Date of Discharge. When a recommendation for discharge under this provision is
   approved, the commander notifies the airman and sets a date for the discharge. Usually this
   should be at least 30 days after the notification date. It may be earlier at the option of the
   member.
5.11. Conditions That Interfere with Military Service. Airman may be discharged based
upon one of the physical or mental conditions listed below when the commander determines the
condition interferes with assignment or duty performance (for commander’s responsibility see
AFI 44-109, Mental Health, Confidentiality, and Military Law). When a psychiatrist or a PhD-
level clinical psychologist confirms a diagnosis of a mental disorder, under paragraph 5.11.9,
that is so severe the member’s ability to function effectively in the military environment is
significantly impaired and the commander chooses not to initiate separation action, the
commander must have the decision reviewed by the discharge authority. Conditions warranting
disability processing under AFI 36-3212, Physical Evaluation for Retention, Retirement, and
Separation, will not be used to justify a separation under this regulation. The existence of a
condition that is a basis for discharge under this provision does not bar separation for any other
reason authorized in this instruction. Discharge under this provision is not appropriate if the
airman's record would support discharge for another reason, such as misconduct or unsatisfactory
performance. A recommendation for discharge must be supported by documents confirming the
existence of the condition or disorder and, except when enuresis or sleepwalking is involved,
explain the adverse effect on assignment or duty performance. This explanation should detail the
effects on member’s performance, conduct (on and off duty), inability to adapt to military
environment, or other reasons, that would limit the member’s potential for completing his or her
enlistment. The evidence of adverse effect on assignment or duty performance may be in the
form of, but not limited to, evaluation(s), counseling statement(s), training records, statements
from instructors, supervisors or peers, or other administrative actions or documentation. Such
adverse effects must be evidenced in the airmen’s current enlistment or extension of enlistment.
Additionally, there must be documentation pre-dating the initiation of discharge showing that the
airman has been formally counseled concerning deficiencies and afforded an opportunity to
overcome them. Airman must be counseled that discharge for any condition under this
paragraph does not qualify as a disability under AFI 36-3212. The discharge case must contain
documentation of the counseling tailored to the specific condition or mental disorder, i.e., reason
for discharge. NOTE: The unit commander is responsible to ensure the counseling requirement
has been met. The possible reasons for discharge under this provision are:
   5.11.1. Enuresis, if there is no underlying pathology.
   5.11.2. Sleepwalking and/or severe nightmares.
74                                                                     AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


     5.11.3. Dyslexia and other learning disorders.
     5.11.4. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.
     5.11.5. Stammering or stuttering of such a degree that the airman is normally unable to
     communicate adequately.
     5.11.6. Incapacitating fear of flying confirmed by a psychiatric evaluation, or phobic fear of
     air, sea and submarine modes of transportation.
     5.11.7. Airsickness, Motion, and/or Travel Sickness.
 5.11.8. Other conditions as outlined in DODI 1332.38, Physical Disability Evaluation,
 Enclosure 5, that interfere with duty performance and are not within the purview of the AFI
 36-3212, Physical Evaluation for Retention, Retirement, and Separation, disability
 evaluation system and provided a basis for separation is not addressed elsewhere in this
 instruction.
 5.11.9. Mental Disorders. A recommendation for discharge under these provisions must be
 supported by a report of evaluation by a psychiatrist or PhD-level clinical psychologist who
 confirms the diagnosis of a disorder listed below, as contained in the current edition of the
 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). This report must state the
 disorder is so severe the member's ability to function effectively in the military environment
 is significantly impaired. This report may not be used as, or substituted for, the explanation
 of the adverse effect of the condition on assignment or duty performance.
        5.11.9.1. Personality disorders. Additional processing is required before Airmen who
        have served in an imminent danger pay area may be discharged for personality disorder.
        See paragraph 5.11.10.
        5.11.9.2. Disruptive behavior disorders.
        5.11.9.3. Adjustment disorders.
        5.11.9.4. Impulse control disorders.
        5.11.9.5. Transsexualism or Gender Identity Disorder of Adolescence or Adulthood,
        Nontranssexual Type (GIDAANT).
        5.11.9.6. Other disorders, as defined in DSM that interfere with duty performance or
        failure to adapt to military environment and are not within the purview of the AFI 36-
        3212, Physical Evaluation for Retention, Retirement, and Separation, and provided a
        basis for separation is not addressed elsewhere in this instruction.
 5.11.10. Procedures: Personality Disorder Discharge of Airman with Imminent Danger
 Pay Service.
        5.11.10.1. Special processing is required for airmen who are currently serving or who
        have served in an imminent danger pay area and have been diagnosed with a personality
        disorder for which discharge action is or may be contemplated. The criteria below must
        be followed before discharge under paragraph 5.11.9.1 may be initiated.
            5.11.10.1.1. The diagnosis of a personality disorder must specifically address post-
            traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other mental illness co-morbidity.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                          75


           5.11.10.1.2. DELETED.
           5.11.10.1.3. Separation under this provision will not be initiated if there is a
           diagnosis of service-related PTSD, unless the airman is subsequently found fit for
           duty under the disability evaluation system IAW AFI 36-3212.
           5.11.10.1.4. The evaluating psychiatrist or PhD-level clinical psychologist will
           consult with the Airman’s commander to determine if separation under this provision
           is appropriate. When, in the opinion of the Airman’s commander, evaluating
           psychiatrist or PhD-level clinical psychologist, separation under paragraph 5.11.9.1
           (Personality Disorder) is appropriate, the local Military Treatment Facility (MTF)
           will forward the diagnosis with supporting documentation through appropriate
           channels for corroboration by a peer or higher-level mental health professional and
           endorsement from the Air Force Surgeon General. Documentation will be forwarded
           to the Air Force Medical Operations Agency to obtain Air Force Surgeon General
           endorsement. In such cases where the Air Force Surgeon General (SG) does not
           concur in the diagnosis of a personality disorder, no further action will be taken under
           this provision.
           5.11.10.1.5. Upon receipt of the Air Force SG review concurring in the diagnosis of a
           personality disorder, the MTF will notify the Airman’s commander of the decision. If
           all requirements of this (paragraph 5.11.10) have been met, separation processing
           will be initiated IAW Chapter 6 of this instruction.
5.12. Action by the Special Court Martial (SPCM) Authority. The SPCM authority finally
approves or disapproves discharge under this provision unless an Airman who has made an
unrestricted report of sexual assault requests review of the discharge (see paragraph 1.31). If the
initiating commander is also the SPCM authority, the case will be referred to the GCM authority.
Commanders who exercise both SPCM and GCM authority may designate the vice commander
to take the above actions.

Section 5C—Defective Enlistments.

5.13. Types of Defects. Defective enlistments fall into four general groups. The action
authorized or required for each type depends on the nature of the defect.
   5.13.1. Enlistment of Minors. A person under 17 years of age is barred by law from
   enlistment. For more information about these void enlistments, see below. The parent (or
   parents) or guardian (or guardians) of an airman who is 17 may apply for the airman's
   discharge if the conditions in paragraph 2.20 are met.
   5.13.2. Void Enlistments:
       5.13.2.1. An enlistment may be void because the individual is under age or for a reason
       other than minority. For information about conditions that bar the creation of a valid
       enlistment, see Title 10 U.S.C., Sections 504 and 505. An enlistment must be a voluntary
       act by a sane, sober person. A deserter from another service cannot enlist in the Air
       Force.
       5.13.2.2. A constructive enlistment is one that was void but has been validated when the
       person:
 76                                                                     AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


             5.13.2.2.1. Submits voluntarily to military authority;
             5.13.2.2.2. Met the mental competency and minimum age qualifications for
             enlistment at the time of voluntary submission to military authority;
             5.13.2.2.3. Received military pay or allowances; and
             5.13.2.2.4. Performed military duties. NOTE: A person who is a deserter from
             another service must be released from the custody and control of the Air Force
             without regard to a subsequent constructive enlistment.
         5.13.2.3. For information about separation from a void enlistment, see paragraph 2.19.
         5.13.2.4. If an enlistment that was void at inception has been validated according to
         paragraph 5.13.2.2, treat it as an erroneous enlistment.
      5.13.3. Erroneous Enlistments. An erroneous enlistment is one the Air Force should not
      have accepted but it does not involve fraud. For discharge or waiver options, see paragraphs
      5.14 and 5.19.
      5.13.4. Fraudulent Entry. A fraudulent entry is one involving deliberate deception on the
      part of the member. For discharge or waiver options, see paragraphs 5.15 and 5.19.
5.14. Basis for Discharge for Erroneous Enlistment. Errors in the enlistment process occur
when the Air Force does not have the true facts or does not take the right action. An airman is
subject to discharge from an erroneous enlistment, reenlistment, or extension of enlistment if:
      5.14.1. It would not have occurred had the relevant facts been known by the Air Force and
      the eligibility criteria of AFIs 36-2002 (formerly AFR 33-3) and 36-2606 (formerly AFR 35-
      16, volume 1), had been followed;
      5.14.2. It was not the result of fraudulent conduct on the part of the member; and
      5.14.3. The defect is unchanged in any material respect.
5.15. Basis for Discharge for Fraudulent Entry. An airman may be discharged for fraudulent
entry based on the procurement of a fraudulent enlistment or period of military service through
any deliberate, material misrepresentation, omission, or concealment that, if known at the time of
enlistment or entry into a period of military service, might have resulted in rejection. The fraud
may occur at any time in the enlistment process; for example, when airmen are asked to fill out
forms.
   5.15.1. Final action by the official authorized to direct the execution of an approved
   discharge for fraudulent entry constitutes the Air Force administrative determination of the
   existence of a fraudulent enlistment. The option to discharge for fraud administratively does
   not preclude action under the UCMJ based on the fraudulent entry or other violations.
5.16. Action Required of the Commander:
   5.16.1. Verification of the Facts. A commander who has information that shows an
   enlistment may be erroneous or fraudulent must verify the information as soon as possible.
   Official correspondence from another service, copies of documents from the personnel
   records, security investigative agencies reports, or a computer printout from the Defense
   Manpower and Data Center may serve as proof of prior service.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                              77


      5.16.1.1. MPF Personnel Relocation Element helps get information about prior service
      and refers questions about documentation to HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2. For the format to
      be used to request information about a civil court record, use Figure 5.1 Ask the local
      Office of Special Investigation (OSI) detachment to run a fingerprint check through the
      Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to positively identify the person. Ask the SGH to
      review information indicating concealment of medical defects or medical history.
   5.16.2. Evaluation of the Facts. For information about disposition of cases involving
   specific types of fraud, see paragraphs 5.18 and 5.19 As soon as the facts of the case are
   verified, the commander must decide whether to recommend discharge or waiver of the fraud
   or error. If the commander fails to act, a constructive waiver may occur. For more
   information, see paragraph 5.19
   5.16.3. Recommendation for Disposition. If it is found that the member is subject to
   discharge for erroneous enlistment or fraudulent entry, the commander must act promptly to
   recommend:
      5.16.3.1. Discharge for erroneous enlistment or fraudulent entry;
      5.16.3.2. Discharge for another reason; or
      5.16.3.3. Waiver of the option to discharge according to paragraph 5.19
      5.16.3.4. Preprocessing Consideration. Preprocessing counseling and rehabilitation are
      not applicable.
5.17. Concealment of Prior Service. Use Table 5.1 for information about the disposition of
airmen who conceal their records of prior service.
   5.17.1. It is the general policy to discharge airmen who conceal:
      5.17.1.1. Records of prior military service that would have made them ineligible for
      entry at the time of their entry.
      5.17.1.2. Facts about their prior service that would have made them ineligible for entry.
   5.17.2. Commanders who deem such action to be in the best interest of the Air Force may
   recommend waiver of discharge for fraud in either of the above circumstances.
   5.17.3. Airmen are not subject to discharge for fraud if the prior military service concealed:
      5.17.3.1. Consists of an unterminated enlistment in a Reserve component of one of the
      armed forces, and before entering the Air Force, the member had not received orders to
      report:
          5.17.3.1.1. To active military service; or
          5.17.3.1.2. For a medical examination in preparation for entry on active duty.
      5.17.3.2. Was not the last period of active service, and the last period of active service:
          5.17.3.2.1. Was disclosed.
          5.17.3.2.2. Was characterized as honorable.
          5.17.3.2.3. Included at least 2 years of active duty.
 78                                                                      AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


         5.17.3.3. Was terminated under conditions that, if made known at the time of entry,
         would not have been a bar to entry under the regulations in effect at that time.
5.18. Concealment of Other Bars to Enlistment:
      5.18.1. Civil Court Records. Airmen are subject to discharge for fraudulent entry based on
      concealment of a conviction by civil authorities that, if it had occurred after enlistment,
      would be a basis for discharge for misconduct. For specific criteria, see paragraph 5.51
      5.18.2. Medical Conditions. Insanity is a bar to enlistment. An airman found to have been
      legally insane at the time of enlistment may be serving in a void enlistment. HQ
      AFMPC/DPMARS2 makes the decision in these cases. For more information, see
      paragraph 2.19 Use Table 5.2 and Table 5.3 for information about disposition of other
      cases involving concealment of medical defects or a history of medical conditions.
      5.18.3. Alienage. Airmen must be discharged if they enter the Air Force fraudulently or
      erroneously by claiming to be a citizen of the United States or claiming to be lawfully
      admitted to the United States for permanent residence (Title 10 U.S.C, Section. 8253).
         5.18.3.1. Basis for Discharge. Aliens are subject to discharge for:
             5.18.3.1.1. Fraudulent entry if they willfully misrepresent themselves as citizens of
             the United States.
             5.18.3.1.2. Erroneous enlistment if they claim US citizenship in an honest, but
             mistaken, belief they are citizens.
             5.18.3.1.3. Erroneous enlistment if they do not misrepresent their nationality but are
             allowed to enter the Air Force in violation of regulations in effect at the time of entry.
         5.18.3.2. When discharge action is initiated against an alien, the SPCM authority reports
         the case to the nearest Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) office. If INS asks
         for custody of the airman prior to discharge and deports or interns the member, process
         discharge in absentia. For more information about processing discharge in absentia, see
         paragraph 1.12 For aliens discharged for alienage and desertion, comply with AFI 36-
         3202 (formerly AFR 35-6) to inform the INS and State Department of the discharge
         action.
      5.18.4. Minority. Airmen who are minors at the time of their entry are not subject to
      discharge under this section if they misrepresent their age or the consent of their parents or
      guardians. They may be discharged for minority according to paragraph 2.20.
      5.18.5. Preservice Homosexual Conduct. If the material misrepresentation includes
      preservice homosexual conduct:
         5.18.5.1. DELETED.
         5.18.5.2. DELETED.
5.19. Waiver of Discharge for Fraudulent Entry or Erroneous Enlistment. Airmen found to
be subject to discharge under this section, except for reasons of alienage, may be granted waivers
to stay in the Air Force. If they seem to be good risks, their retention may serve the best interest
of the Air Force.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                       79


  5.19.1. Fraudulent Entry. In deciding whether to waive this discharge option, look at the type
  of fraud and whether there are extenuating circumstances. Process a discharge waiver when
  retention of the airman seems to be appropriate. As a rule, airmen who conceal acts
  involving moral turpitude should not receive waivers, even though the acts have not been the
  subject of action by civil authorities. This applies without regard to the maximum
  punishment for such acts. However, commanders may consider recommending a waiver
  involving moral turpitude if exceptional and unique circumstances warrant consideration of a
  waiver.
  5.19.2. Erroneous Enlistment. Find the cause of the error and be sure it did not involve
  fraud on the part of the airman. Consider the training the member received, evaluate the past
  duty performance, and determine the potential for satisfactory service in the future. Waiver
  of discharge for erroneous enlistment may be appropriate when the defect:
     5.19.2.1. No longer exists. For example, charges pending in civil court at the time the
     member enlisted have been dismissed.
     5.19.2.2. Is one that could have been waived according to AFIs 36-2002 (formerly AFR
     33-3) or 36-2606 (formerly AFR 35-16, volume 1).
     5.19.2.3. Consists of failure to meet physical standards for enlistment and the airman is
     medically qualified for worldwide duty.
     5.19.2.4. In the best interest of the Air Force.
  5.19.3. Constructive Waiver. If a commander has the facts of the case indicating possible
  fraud or error and fails to act, the airman may become the recipient of a constructive waiver.
  Failure to exercise the option to discharge when the facts are known tends to show intent to
  retain the airman. The mere passage of time, standing alone, is not sufficient for a
  constructive waiver. There must be other acts in conjunction with the passage of time which
  reflect the intent to retain the member, such as promotion or reassignment.
     5.19.3.1. The determination as to whether or not there is a constructive waiver must be
     made by the commander having the express waiver authority, not by a discharge board or
     other authority although they may make recommendations. Where discharge action has
     been initiated, the passing of time is immaterial to the issue of whether a constructive
     waiver has resulted.
  5.19.4. Processing Waiver Recommendations. The unit commander sends the
  recommendation to the SPCM authority through the servicing MPF. The recommendation
  must give a detailed, documented statement of the facts of the case, tell why the airman is
  subject to discharge, and give the reason for recommending the waiver. The SPCM authority
  approves or disapproves the waiver. If the SPCM authority initiated the recommendation, it
  must be sent to the GCM authority for final action. If the waiver is:
     5.19.4.1. Approved, take no further action on the defect in the enlistment.
     5.19.4.2. Disapproved, return the case to the commander to initiate discharge processing.
  5.19.5. Credit for Service. Airmen discharged for fraudulent entry do not receive credit for
  the service they performed. Airmen receive credit if:
     5.19.5.1. They are discharged for erroneous enlistment.
 80                                                                    AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


       5.19.5.2. The fraud is waived and they are discharged for another reason.
5.20. Discharge for Other Reasons. Airmen found to have entered fraudulently, may be
discharged for other reasons, if there are extenuating circumstances. Not all cases of fraudulent
entry are the same and they do not require the same action. It will be found that some airmen,
although they deserve a waiver of the fraud, cannot be retained in the Air Force. The fact that
they must be discharged should not be a bar to a waiver of the fraud, if their enlistment motives
and their military records justify the waiver.
   5.20.1. A recommendation for discharge for another reason must cite the specifics of the
   fraud and explain why the airman should be discharged for another reason. Approval of the
   recommendation constitutes a waiver of the fraud. Two examples of cases in which the fraud
   might be waived to permit discharge for another reason follow:
       5.20.1.1. Example One. The airman entered fraudulently concealing a medical defect or
       the history of one, which, if made known at the time of entry, would have or might have
       precluded the entry. The airman serves a good part of the enlistment before the fraud is
       found.
           5.20.1.1.1. Medical examination shows the disqualifying medical condition still
           exists and disqualifies airman for retention in the Air Force. It is further found, or it
           becomes evident, that the airman, at the time of entry, did not hide the medical
           information in an effort to get retirement and monetary benefits.
           5.20.1.1.2. Rather, the airman came into the Air Force in the honest but mistaken
           belief that the medical condition would not be a bar to service. The airman's military
           record since entry has been good. In this case, there would be no objection to a waiver
           of the fraud so the airman could be separated under AFI 36-2902 (Formerly AFR 35-
           4) due to a disability existing prior to entry.
       5.20.1.2. Example Two. The airman enters fraudulently denying the existence of
       dependents which if acknowledged, would or might have been a bar to entry. The airman
       serves a large part of the enlistment and then acquires more dependents. New problems at
       home cause the airman to apply for hardship discharge and the fraudulent entry is
       discovered. If the airman's service has been good and the conditions for hardship are met,
       there may be no objection to waiving the fraud to allow the airman to be discharged
       according to paragraph 3.19.
5.21. 1. See Table 5.4. for the types of separation authorized and the approval authority for
each. Airmen who conceal prior service not characterized as honorable should, as a rule, be
discharged under other than honorable conditions. In addition, refer to paragraph 1.30. of this
Instruction for special processing procedures for a service characterization under other than
honorable conditions.
   5.21.1. See Table 5.4 for the types of separation authorized and the approval authority for
   each. Airmen who conceal prior service not characterized as honorable should, as a rule, be
   discharged under other than honorable conditions.
   5.21.2. DELETED.
   5.21.3. If fraudulent enlistment is the only reason for discharge, the member is not eligible
   for probation and rehabilitation (P&R) under Chapter 7. If discharge is approved for another
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                         81


   reason and the fraud is waived, the member is eligible for P&R. In that case, the suspension
   is based on the reason for which separation was approved.

Section 5D—Entry Level Performance or Conduct.

5.22. Eligibility and Criteria. Airmen in entry level status should be discharged when their
unsatisfactory performance or conduct shows they are not qualified to be productive members of
the Air Force.
   5.22.1. An airman may be discharged under this provision only if the discharge processing
   starts during the first 180 days of continuous active military service or the first 180 days of
   continuous active military service after a break of more than 92 days of active service.
   5.22.2. Unsatisfactory performance or conduct may be shown in a number of ways. They
   may include, but are not limited to:
       5.22.2.1. Lack of aptitude for military service;
       5.22.2.2. Failure to adapt to the military environment;
       5.22.2.3. Failure to make satisfactory progress in a required training program;
       5.22.2.4. Reluctance to make the effort necessary to meet Air Force standards of conduct
       and duty performance;
       5.22.2.5. Lack of self discipline;
       5.22.2.6. Minor disciplinary infractions;
       5.22.2.7. Failure to meet fitness standards (paragraph 5.65).
   5.22.3. Eligibility for discharge under this section does not preclude separation for another
   reason when the separation is authorized and warranted by the circumstances of the case. For
   example, if the member failed in drug abuse rehabilitation, action under Section 5F may be
   more appropriate.
5.23. Preprocessing Counseling and Rehabilitation. Counseling and rehabilitation efforts are
most necessary for airmen new to the service. Military service is a calling and is not like any
civilian occupation. It is a way of life to be taught young airmen. When unsatisfactory
performance or conduct is the sole reason for discharge, they may not be separated until there
have been efforts to help them meet Air Force standards. For more information, see paragraph
5.2.
5.24. Procedures, Type of Separation, and Approval Authority:
   5.24.1. Comply with the notification procedures in Chapter 6, Section 6B. Cite the specific
   incidents that led to the decision to recommend discharge. Include all records of formal
   counseling and rehabilitation efforts. Note the member's response, or the lack of response, to
   these efforts.
   5.24.2. The records of airmen with very brief service will not contain all the items of
   information required for the commander's recommendation (Figure 6.5). The first four items
   in the recommendation are required in every case. Show the others if they exist for the
   airman.
 82                                                                     AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


      5.24.3. Discharge under this section will be described as an entry level separation.
   5.24.4. The SPCM authority personally approves or disapproves discharge under this
   provision unless an Airman who has made an unrestricted report of sexual assault requests
   review of the discharge (see paragraph 1.31). If the SPCM authority also exercises GCM
   authority, the vice commander may be designated, in writing, to act personally on these
   cases. If the SPCM authority is the initiating commander, the case must be referred to the
   GCM authority for final decision.

Section 5E—Unsatisfactory Performance.

5.25. Eligibility. Airmen should be discharged when their unsatisfactory performance or
conduct shows they are not qualified for service with the Air Force. Performance in the Air
Force includes, but is not limited to, work done as assigned duties, military training, bearing, and
behavior. It necessarily includes the member's continuing responsibility for maintaining the high
standards of personal behavior and conduct required of military members at all times. Airmen
may not be discharged under this provision:
   5.25.1. If they are in entry level status. Unsatisfactory performance in entry level status is a
   basis for discharge under Section 5D.
   5.25.2. Until they have been counseled about their deficiencies and have a chance to
   overcome them.
5.26. Criteria. Airmen are subject to discharge for unsatisfactory performance based on
documented failure to meet Air Force standards. Commanders must weigh an airman's conduct,
military deportment, and duty performance against those of other airmen of like grade, age, and
length of service. While unsatisfactory performance may be due to one flaw in a member's
abilities, it is shown as a rule, in more than one way. When this is the case, the recommendation
for discharge for unsatisfactory performance should cite all the deficiencies that were not
overcome by counseling and rehabilitation. One or more of the following may be used as the
basis for discharge under this provision:
      5.26.1. Unsatisfactory duty performance:
         5.26.1.1. Failure to perform assigned duties properly.
         5.26.1.2. A progressively downward trend in performance ratings.
         5.26.1.3. Failure to demonstrate the qualities of leadership required by the member's
         grade.
      5.26.2. Failure to maintain standards of dress and personal appearance (other than fitness
      standards) or military deportment.
   5.26.3. Failure to progress in military training required to be qualified for service with the
   Air Force or for performance of primary duties.
   5.26.4. Irresponsibility in the management of personal finances.
      5.26.5. Unsanitary habits such as repeated infection of venereal disease, persistent refusal to
      bathe, and similar refusal to observe personal hygiene.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                        83


   5.26.6. Failure to meet minimum fitness standards. Airmen who fail to meet minimum
   standards of fitness for reasons not amounting to disability may be discharged. Follow the
   procedures for fitness management according to current Fitness Program AFI before starting
   action to discharge. Make sure the case file shows the record of those actions.
5.27. Preprocessing Actions:
   5.27.1. Do not start discharge action based on unsatisfactory performance until the airman
   has been formally counseled about the deficiencies and has had a chance to overcome them.
   The counseling and rehabilitation requirements of paragraph 5.2 are particularly important
   in these cases. Because military service is not like any civilian occupation, a member should
   not be discharged for unsatisfactory performance until there have been reasonable efforts at
   rehabilitation.
       5.27.1.1. An airman performance report (EPR) directed by the commander according to
       AFI 36-2403, Enlisted Evaluation System (formerly AFR 39-62 and AFP 39-15), may
       help a commander evaluate all aspects of a member's performance when discharge under
       this provision is under consideration.
   5.27.2. Differentiate between airmen who should be discharged for unsatisfactory
   performance and those who should be discharged for misconduct according to Section 5H.
   5.27.3. Unsatisfactory performance should not be the sole basis for a discharge
   recommendation if the circumstances of the case warrant consideration of discharge for
   failure in drug or alcohol abuse rehabilitation, or misconduct. For information about
   processing an action based on more than one reason, see Chapter 6, Section 6H.
5.28. Separation Authority and Type of Separation:
   5.28.1. The SPCM authority personally approves or disapproves discharge under this
   provision unless an Airman who has made an unrestricted report of sexual assault requests
   review of the discharge (see paragraph 1.31). If the SPCM authority also exercises GCM
   authority, the vice commander may be designated, in writing, to act personally on these
   cases. If the SPCM authority is the initiating commander, the case must be referred to the
   GCM authority for final decision.
   5.28.2. The service of airmen discharged for unsatisfactory performance will be
   characterized as honorable or general (instructions for service characterization in Chapter 1,
   Section 1B, apply). However, if the sole reason for separation is for failure to meet physical
   fitness standards, then only an honorable characterization may be given.
5.29. Suspension of Discharge. Airmen approved for discharge under this provision should be
considered for probation and rehabilitation under Chapter 7. If the respondent has lengthy
service, comply with Chapter 6, Section 6F.

Section 5F—Substance Abuse Treatment Failure.

5.30. Commander's Options. AFPD 36-27 contains Air Force policy for the evaluation,
treatment and disposition of members who abuse alcohol or other drugs. Successful treatment
and return to duty is the objective of the substance abuse control programs. Before commanders
start action to discharge airmen who abuse alcohol or other drugs, they must:
 84                                                                     AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


   5.30.1. Look at all the facts of the case to ensure compliance with AFI 36-2701 (Formerly
   AFR 30-2).
   5.30.2. Evaluate evidence of the airman's failure to meet other Air Force standards. If the
   military record in the current enlistment would support discharge for another reason, it may
   be appropriate to process the separation under another section of this chapter.
   5.30.3. Differentiate between the member who should be discharged under this section and
   one who should be discharged for misconduct or unsatisfactory performance. For example,
   illegal activity in connection with drugs may be a basis for discharge for misconduct.
   Deteriorating duty performance, failure to meet AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal
   Appearance of Personnel (formerly AFR 35-10) standards, and financial irresponsibility
   associated with alcohol abuse may be a basis for discharge for unsatisfactory performance.
   5.30.4. The fact that an airman has been entered in a rehabilitation program does not bar
   discharge for other reasons.
5.31. Failure in Drug Abuse Treatment:
   5.31.1. Airmen are subject to discharge under this provision if they:
      5.31.1.1. Are in a program of rehabilitation for personal abuse of drugs.
      5.31.1.2. Fail to successfully complete the program due to:
          5.31.1.2.1. Inability.
          5.31.1.2.2. Refusal to participate in the program.
          5.31.1.2.3. Unwillingness to cooperate.
   5.31.2. Such airmen should be separated if they:
      5.31.2.1. Lack the potential for continued military service.
      5.31.2.2. Need long-term treatment and are transferred to a civilian medical facility for
      treatment.
5.32. Failure in Alcohol Abuse Treatment:
   5.32.1. Airmen are subject to discharge under this provision if they:
      5.32.1.1. Are in a program of treatment for alcohol abuse; and
      5.32.1.2. Fail to successfully complete the program due to:
          5.32.1.2.1. Inability.
          5.32.1.2.2. Refusal to participate in the program.
          5.32.1.2.3. Unwillingness to cooperate.
   5.32.2. Such airmen should be separated if they:
      5.32.2.1. Lack the potential for continued military service; or
      5.32.2.2. Need long-term treatment and are transferred to a civilian medical facility for
      treatment.
5.33. Type of Separation and Separation Authority:
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                            85


   5.33.1. Separation under this section will be:
       5.33.1.1. Described as an entry level separation if the member is in entry level status.
       5.33.1.2. Characterized as honorable or general according to Chapter 1, Section 1B, in
       other cases.
   5.33.2. Refer to paragraph 1.21 to determine if information concerning personal alcohol or
   drug abuse provided by the member, or if evidence of drug abuse derived from drug testing,
   may be considered on the issue of characterization.
   5.33.3. The SPCM authority personally approves or disapproves discharge under this section
   unless an Airman who has made an unrestricted report of sexual assault requests review of
   the discharge (see paragraph 1.31). If the SPCM authority also exercises GCM authority, the
   vice commander may be designated, in writing, to act personally on these cases. If the
   SPCM authority is the initiating commander, the case must be referred to the GCM authority
   for final decision.
5.34. Suspension of Discharge. Airmen approved for discharge under this provision are
eligible for probation and rehabilitation under Chapter 7. If they have lengthy service, the
provisions of Chapter 6, Section 5F, apply. In most cases, the failure in rehabilitation that is the
basis for discharge will make Probation and Rehabilitation (P&R) impractical. In rare cases, it
may be found that the particular circumstances warrant one last opportunity for P&R. It should
be authorized if there are good reasons to expect the airman to serve satisfactorily.

5.38. Recoupment of Advanced Educational Assistance, Special Pay, or Bonuses in
Homosexual Conduct Cases. Where the applicable statute, regulation or agreement authorizes
recoupment when separation is “voluntary” or because of “misconduct,” the following special
rules apply only in homosexual conduct cases:

5.39. The FY94 National Defense Authorization Act amended 10 U. S.C. 2005 to require
the Secretary of the Air Force to appoint an investigating officer when a person disputes owing a
debt for advanced education assistance funds. The investigating officer will examine the facts of
the case and hear evidence presented by the person who may owe the debt and other parties, as
appropriate, in order to determine the validity of the debt. The investigating officer then makes
findings and recommendations in a report for the Secretary. The discharge board or, if the board
is waived, the separation authority, will make these findings and recommendations in lieu of an
investigating officer. Accordingly, respondents must be provided notice that their right to an
examination of the propriety of the disputed debt of advance education assistance funds will be
accomplished by the board or discharge authority in lieu of an investigating officer appointed by
the Secretary.
5.40. Action Required of the Commander:
   5.40.1. The unit commander determines the extent and type of investigation needed to find
   whether probable cause for discharge exists based on the type of information received. If
   the unit commander determines that no credible information exists to form a basis for
   discharge, he or she may decide no further action is warranted. However, if the unit
   commander believes there is credible information that a basis for discharge exists, then the
   unit commander can request a fact-finding inquiry be conducted. If not a General Court-
   Martial Convening Authority (GCMCA) who is also a general officer, the unit commander
   forwards the information to the first GCMCA who is a general officer in the member's chain
   of command.
   5.40.2. The first GCMCA who is a general officer in the member’s chain of command:
       5.40.2.1. Shall initiate discharge processing if there is probable cause to believe
       separation is warranted under paragraph 5.36. In making this probable cause
       determination, the standards of Attachment 4, paragraphs A4.4. through A4.7. are
       applicable.
       5.40.2.2. Is not required to comply with paragraph 5.2. Preprocessing counseling and
       rehabilitation are not applicable.
   5.40.3. DELETED.

   5.40.4. DELETED.
5.41. Recommendations of the Administrative Discharge Board.
   5.41.1. If the board finds that one or more of the circumstances authorizing separation under
   paragraph 5.36.2. is supported by a preponderance of the evidence, the board must
   recommend discharge unless there is a further finding that retention is warranted under the
   circumstances described in paragraph 5.36 (See paragraph 5.37).
5.42. When Retention is Considered:
   5.42.1. The member shall bear the burden of proving throughout the proceeding, by a
   preponderance of the evidence, that retention is warranted under the limited circumstances
   described in paragraph 5.36.2.
   5.42.2. Findings regarding the existence of the circumstances warranting a member's
   retention under paragraph 5.36 are required of the board or the discharge authority only if:
       5.42.2.1. The member clearly and specifically raises such circumstances; or
       5.42.2.2. The board or discharge authority relies upon such circumstances to justify the
       member's retention.
5.43. Other Authorized Disposition. Nothing in this regulation:
   5.43.1. Limits the authority of the Secretary of the Air Force to take appropriate action in a
   case to ensure that there has been compliance with the provisions of this section.
   5.43.2. Authorizes a member to seek Secretarial review.
   5.43.3. Precludes discharge in appropriate circumstances for another reason set forth in this
   regulation.
   5.43.4. Precludes trial by court-martial in appropriate cases.
   5.43.5. Requires that a member be processed for separation when a determination is made by
   the member's commander that:
   5.43.6. The member engaged in acts, made statements, or married or attempted to marry a
   person known to be of the same biological sex for the purpose of avoiding or terminating
   military service; and
   5.43.7. Separation of the member would not be in the best interest of the Air Force.
5.44. Separation Authority:
   5.44.1. The GCMCA, if a general officer, personally takes final action on the case.
       5.44.1.1. If the GCM authority is not a general officer, he or she forwards the case to the
       first general officer GCMCA in his or her chain of command for disposition.
       5.44.1.2. If the member waives the board hearing and the separation authority directs a
       type of separation less favorable than the commander recommends, the approving
       correspondence must include a detailed statement of the reasons for the less favorable
       characterization.
       5.44.1.3. In cases where the member did not waive the board or waived the board and
       requested retention, if the GCMCA directs separation, prior to execution of the
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                        89


       separation, the GCMCA will forward the case file to the Director, Air Force Review
       Boards Agency (AFRBA) for review. The case file will be forwarded to the review
       authority by the most expeditious means possible.
   5.44.2. Director, AFRBA takes appropriate action within 7 work days of receipt. The review
   authority can take the following actions:
       5.44.2.1. No action (leaving the separation authority decisions unaltered); or
       5.44.2.2. Take any action more favorable to the member including directing retention or
       a more favorable separation characterization; or
       5.44.2.3. Return the case to the GCMCA who took action for further specific processing
       requirements. (Note: The case may need to be returned to SAF/MRB for review of a
       subsequent separation decision).
       5.44.2.4. DELETED.
   5.44.3. DELETED.
5.45. Suspension of Discharge. Airmen approved for discharge under this provision are not
eligible for probation and rehabilitation under Chapter 7. If the member has lengthy service, the
provisions of Chapter 6, Section 6F, apply. If the member is retirement eligible, the provisions
of Chapter 6, Section 6E apply.

Section 5H—Misconduct.

5.46. Policy. Airmen in the active military service are required to maintain, both on and off
duty, the high standards of personal conduct set for Air Force members. They occupy a unique
position in society, representing the military establishment 24 hours a day. This special status
carries with it a permanent obligation to uphold and maintain the dignity and good reputation of
the Air Force at all times and in all places. Therefore, unacceptable conduct any time adversely
affects military duty performance.
5.47. Types of Misconduct. Airmen are subject to discharge when there is evidence of one or
more of the acts or patterns of misconduct described in this section (paragraph 5.3.1). If this
requirement is met, the entire military record may be considered in deciding whether the member
should be discharged or retained.
   5.47.1. For information about patterns of conduct that make an airman subject to discharge,
   see paragraphs 5.49 and 5.50 Airmen in entry level status will not be discharged under
   paragraph 5.49 If a pattern of minor disciplinary infractions warrants the discharge of an
   airman in entry level status, process the case under Section 5D.
   5.47.2. One serious military or civilian offense may be a basis for discharge for misconduct.
   A basis for discharge exists if the MCM authorizes a punitive discharge for the offense or a
   closely related one. Commanders must look closely at the specific circumstances of the
   offense and the guidance in paragraph 6.1 to decide whether discharge processing is
   warranted. For more information about specific offenses that are a basis for discharge, see
   paragraphs 5.52, 5.54, and 5.55.
 90                                                                   AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


      5.47.3. Conviction by civil authorities is a basis for discharge under some conditions. To
      find whether the action by a court makes the member subject to discharge for misconduct,
      see paragraph 5.51.
   5.47.4. Misconduct involving sexual assault or sexual assault of a child must be processed
   under paragraph 5.55.
   5.47.5. Misconduct involving fraudulent entry must be considered under Section 5C.
   5.47.6. Misconduct involving drug abuse must be processed under paragraph 5.54.
   5.47.7. Do not start discharge processing for a pattern of misconduct, paragraph 5.49 or
   5.50, until the member has been counseled about the deficiencies and given a chance to
   overcome them. Comply with the requirements of paragraph 5.2 If the sole reason for
   discharge is one serious offense or a civil court conviction, the counseling and rehabilitation
   requirements are not applicable.
5.48. Type of Separation:
   5.48.1. Refer to Chapter 1, Section 1B, for guidelines for characterizing service. Usually,
   discharges under paragraphs 5.50., 5.51., 5.52, 5.54, and 5.55 should be under other than
   honorable conditions. In addition, refer to paragraph 1.30 of this Instruction for special
   processing procedures for a service characterization under other than honorable conditions.
   5.48.2. If the service of a member warrants an under other than honorable conditions
   characterization and the sole basis for discharge is a serious offense that resulted in
   conviction by a court-martial that did not impose a punitive discharge, the commander will
   process the case under paragraphs 6.2.2 and 1.21.2 EXCEPTION: Cases processed by the
   Commander, Headquarters, Security Police Agency, Kirtland AFB NM, on members in
   rehabilitation or prisoners attached to the 3320th Correction and Rehabilitation Squadron will
   be forwarded directly to HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2 (paragraph 1.21.2).
      5.48.3. If discharge under other than honorable conditions does not appear to be warranted
      under those guidelines:
         5.48.3.1. The separation of an airman in entry level status will be described as an entry
         level separation.
         5.48.3.2. The separation of an airman who has completed entry level status may be
         characterized as under honorable conditions (general).
   5.48.4. The service of a member discharged under this section may be characterized as
   honorable only if:
         5.48.4.1. The member has completed entry level status;
         5.48.4.2. The member's record has been so meritorious that any other characterization
         would be clearly inappropriate; and
         5.48.4.3. The GCM authority approves the service characterization.
5.49. Minor Disciplinary Infractions. A pattern of misconduct consisting solely of these
infractions in the current enlistment makes an airman subject to discharge. The infractions under
this section may involve failure to comply with nonpunitive regulations or minor offenses under
the UCMJ. Infractions of this type result, as a rule, in informal (reduced to writing) or formal
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                          91


counselings, letters of reprimand, or Article 15 nonjudicial punishments. Do not discharge
airmen in entry level status under this provision. Process the action under Section 5D if an
airman in entry level status should be discharged based on minor disciplinary infractions.
5.50. A Pattern of Misconduct. A pattern of misconduct in the current enlistment consisting
wholly or in part of misconduct more serious than that considered under paragraph 5.49 makes
an airman subject to discharge. The specific pattern or patterns of misconduct should be cited in
the separation case. See Chapter 6, Section 6H, when more than one reason identified below is
used. The pattern may consist of:
   5.50.1. Discreditable Involvement with Military or Civil Authorities. Acts for which the
   member was or might have been punished under the UCMJ may be part of the pattern. The
   lack of UCMJ jurisdiction over the offense is irrelevant. Civil offenses that in and of
   themselves are not a basis for discharge under paragraph 5.51 may be cited to show the
   pattern of misconduct.
   5.50.2. Conduct Prejudicial to Good Order and Discipline. This includes conduct of a
   nature that tends to disrupt order, discipline, or morale within the military community. This
   category of misconduct usually involves causing dissent, disruption, and degradation of
   mission effectiveness. It also includes conduct of a nature that tends to bring discredit on the
   Air Force in the view of the civilian community.
   5.50.3. Failure to Support Dependents.
   5.50.4. Dishonorable Failure to Pay Just Debts.
5.51. Civilian Conviction:
   5.51.1. Airmen are subject to discharge for misconduct based on conviction by civilian
   authorities or action tantamount to a finding of guilty, including similar adjudications in
   juvenile proceedings, when:
       5.51.1.1. A punitive discharge would be authorized for the same or a closely related
       offense under the MCM; or
       5.51.1.2. The sentence by civilian authorities includes confinement for 6 months or more
       without regard to suspension or probation.
   5.51.2. Action tantamount to a finding of guilty may occur where, notwithstanding the
   absence of a specific finding of guilty, the court proceeds in a manner that is inconsistent
   with any reasonable hypothesis other than an assumed guilt of misconduct.
       5.51.2.1. The most common example of this exists where, under statutory authority, a
       court or other agency of the judicial or legal system (to include a state or county
       prosecuting attorney in some instances) without a specific finding of guilty, and with the
       consent of the individual, proceeds to subject the individual to some form of deprivation
       or restraint of the person's theretofore unfettered liberty for a period of time as a
       condition to some ultimate official act of grace, forgiveness, or dismissal of charges; for
       example, successful probation in return for a clean record.
   5.51.3. A commander must act promptly when he or she has information indicating a
   member is subject to discharge based on civilian conviction. The commander should evaluate
 92                                                                       AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


      the specific circumstances of the offense, how it occurred, the action of the civilian authority,
      the member's record, and the member's potential for future service.
         5.51.3.1. If the commander determines that discharge action is warranted, discharge
         action should be initiated promptly.
         5.51.3.2. If the commander determines that retention is appropriate and the civilian
         conviction involves an offense for which a punitive discharge and confinement for 1 year
         or more would be authorized for the same or closely related offense under the MCM, then
         a request for waiver of discharge must be processed.
         5.51.3.3. If the commander determines that retention is appropriate and the offense under
         the MCM does not authorize confinement for 1 year or more, then a request for waiver of
         discharge is not required.
         5.51.3.4. If the commander fails to act promptly, the airman may become the recipient of
         a constructive waiver. Failure to exercise the option to discharge when the facts are
         known tends to show intent to retain the airman. The mere passage of time, standing
         alone, is not sufficient for a constructive waiver. There must be other acts in conjunction
         with the passage of time which reflect the intent to retain the member, such as promotion
         or reassignment.
             5.51.3.4.1. The determination as to whether or not there is a constructive waiver must
             be made by the commander having the express waiver authority, not by a discharge
             board or other authority, although they may make recommendations. Where discharge
             action has been initiated, the passing of time is immaterial to the issue of whether a
             constructive waiver has resulted.
      5.51.4. For processing instructions unique to cases involving civilian conviction, see
      Chapter 6, Section 6J.
5.52. Commission of a Serious Offense. Airmen are subject to discharge for misconduct based
on the commission of a serious offense if a punitive discharge would be authorized for the same
or a closely related offense under the MCM. Discharge processing should be initiated if the
specific circumstances of the offense warrant separation.
   5.52.1. Sexual Perversion. Airmen are subject to discharge for misconduct based on acts of
   aberrant sexual behavior or acts of sexual misconduct, which include, but are not limited to,
   the following specific UCMJ offenses: indecent viewing, visual recording, or broadcasting;
   forcible pandering; indecent exposure.

         5.52.1.4. DELETED
   5.52.2. Prolonged Unauthorized Absence. Airmen may be discharged for misconduct
   based on unauthorized absence continuing for 1 year or more. When a member who has been
   absent for 1 year or more returns to military control, the GCM authority decides whether the
   member will be tried by court-martial. If trial for the unauthorized absence is barred, or is
   considered inadvisable, the airman may be processed for administrative discharge. Discharge
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                           93


   processing takes place at the base where the member returns to military control. Airmen who
   do not return to military control may not be processed for discharge for unauthorized absence
   without the approval of HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2. Refer to Chapter 6, Section 6I, for more
   information.
   5.52.3. Unprofessional Relationship by Person Serving in Special Position of Trust as
   Recruiter, Faculty or Staff. Airmen are subject to discharge for misconduct based on acts
   that constitute unprofessional relationships between recruiters and potential recruits during
   the recruiting process or between students and faculty or staff in training schools or
   professional military education setting. Unprofessional relationships include, but are not
   limited to, those listed below.
       5.52.3.1. Dating or carrying on a social relationship with a potential recruit or trainee,
       seeking or engaging in sexual activity with, or making sexual advances to, or accepting
       sexual overtures from a potential recruit or trainee or member of the immediate family of
       a potential recruit or trainee.
       5.52.3.2. Using grade, position, threats, pressure or promises to attain or attempt to attain
       any personal benefit of any kind from a potential recruit or trainee or member of the
       immediate family of a potential recruit or trainee.
       5.52.3.3. Sharing living quarters with, gambling with, lending money to, borrowing
       money from or becoming indebted to, soliciting donations (other than for Air Force
       approved campaigns) from, or using personal resources to provide a potential recruit or
       trainee or member of the immediate family of a potential recruit or trainee with lodging
       or transportation or any other benefit.
   5.52.4. Other Serious Offenses. If the offense that makes the member subject to discharge
   under this paragraph is not covered in paragraph 5.52.1, 5.52.2, or 5.52.3, cite this
   paragraph as the basis of the action.
5.53. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). An airman with seriologic evidence of HIV
infection may be discharged when he or she is found not to have complied with lawfully ordered
preventive medicine procedures.
5.54. Drug Abuse. Drug abuse is incompatible with military service and airmen who abuse
drugs one or more times are subject to discharge for misconduct.
   5.54.1. Drug abuse for purposes of this regulation is the illegal, wrongful, or improper use,
   possession, sale, transfer, or introduction onto a military installation of any drug. This
   includes improper use of prescription medication. The term drug includes any controlled
   substance in schedules I, II, III, IV, and V of Title 21 U.S.C., Section 812. It also includes
   anabolic/androgenic steroids, and any intoxicating substance, other than alcohol, that is
   inhaled, injected, consumed, or introduced into the body in any manner for purposes of
   altering mood or function.
   5.54.2. The presence in the military environment of persons who engage in drug abuse
   seriously impairs accomplishing the military mission. Members who abuse drugs adversely
   affect the ability of the Air Force to:
       5.54.2.1. Maintain discipline, good order, and morale.
       5.54.2.2. Foster mutual trust and confidence among members.
94                                                                   AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


     5.54.2.3. Facilitate assignments and worldwide deployment.
     5.54.2.4. Recruit and retain members.
     5.54.2.5. Maintain public acceptability of military service.
     5.54.2.6. Prevent breaches of security.
  5.54.3. Evidence obtained through urinalysis or evidence furnished by the member in
  connection with initial entry in rehabilitation and treatment may be used to establish a basis
  for discharge. For limits on using such evidence in characterizing service, see paragraph
  1.21.
  5.54.4. Processing Procedures.
     5.54.4.1. Action required. Commanders must act promptly when they have information
     indicating a member is subject to discharge for drug abuse. They evaluate the specific
     circumstances of the offense, the member’s records, and the member’s potential for
     future service and take action in accordance with the following paragraphs:
         5.54.4.1.1. If it is warranted, discharge action must be started promptly. However,
         there is no time limit for initiating discharge action, and failure to do so does not at
         any time constitute a constructive waiver. Discharge action is waived only if waiver is
         expressly approved under Chapter 6, Section 6K.
         5.54.4.1.2. If the commander determines a waiver of discharge is appropriate, a
         request for waiver must be processed promptly. See Chapter 6, Section 6K.
     5.54.4.2. Retention Criteria and Consideration.
         5.54.4.2.1. A member found to have abused drugs will be discharged unless the
         member meets all seven of the following criteria:
             5.54.4.2.1.1. Drug abuse is a departure from the member’s usual and customary
             behavior.
             5.54.4.2.1.2. Drug abuse occurred as the result of drug experimentation (a drug
             experimenter is defined as one who has illegally or improperly used a drug for
             reasons of curiosity, peer pressure, or other similar reasons).
             5.54.4.2.1.3. Drug abuse does not involve recurring incidents, other than drug
             experimentation as defined above.
             5.54.4.2.1.4. The member does not desire to engage in or intend to engage in
             drug abuse in the future.
             5.54.4.2.1.5. Drug abuse under all the circumstances is not likely to recur.
             5.54.4.2.1.6. Under the particular circumstances of the case, the member’s
             continued presence in the Air Force is consistent with the interest of the Air Force
             in maintaining proper discipline, good order, leadership, and morale
             (Noncommissioned officers have special responsibilities by virtue of their status;
             fulfill an integral role in maintaining discipline; and, therefore, must exhibit high
             standards of personal integrity, loyalty, dedication, devotion to duty and
             leadership).
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                        95


              5.54.4.2.1.7. Drug abuse did not involve drug distribution. For the purpose of this
              paragraph, drug distribution means the delivery to the possession of another.
              Distribution does not occur with the transfer of the drugs from one person to
              another while such persons are engaged in the mutual use of drugs, except that
              individuals who obtain, or arrange for obtaining, the drugs used by others are
              involved in distribution. "Delivery" means the actual, constructive, or attempted
              transfer of the drugs, whether or not there exists an agency relationship.
          5.54.4.2.2. The burden of proving that retention is warranted under these limited
          circumstances rests with the member. Findings regarding the existence of each of the
          limited circumstances warranting a member’s retention are required of the board or
          the separation authority only if:
              5.54.4.2.2.1. The member clearly and specifically raises            such limited
              circumstances.
              5.54.4.2.2.2. The board, or in the absence of a board, the separation authority
              relies upon such circumstances to justify the member’s retention.
          5.54.4.2.3. A member approved for discharge for drug abuse is not eligible for
          probation and rehabilitation in accordance with Chapter 7.
5.55. Sexual Assault. Sexual assault and sexual assault of a child are incompatible with
military service and members who commit these offenses are subject to discharge for
misconduct.
   5.55.1. Sexual assault for purposes of this Instruction includes a broad category of sexual
   offenses consisting of the following specific UCMJ offenses: rape, sexual assault,
   aggravated sexual contact, abusive sexual contact, forcible sodomy (forced oral or anal sex),
   or attempts to commit these offenses. Sexual assault of a child for purposes of this
   Instruction includes a broad category of sexual offenses upon children consisting of the
   following specific UCMJ offenses: rape of a child, sexual assault of a child, and sexual
   abuse of a child.

   5.55.2. The presence in the military environment of persons who commit sexual assault or
   sexual assault of a child undermines the ability of our members to work effectively as a team,
   impairs the readiness of our Force, and significantly detracts from accomplishing the military
   mission. Members who commit a sexual assault or sexual assault of a child adversely affect
   the ability of the Air Force to:
      5.55.2.1. Maintain discipline, good order, and morale.
      5.55.2.2. Foster mutual trust and confidence among members.

  5.55.3. Processing Procedures.
     5.55.3.1. Action required. Commanders must act promptly when they have information
     indicating a member is subject to discharge for sexual assault or sexual assault of a child.
     They evaluate the specific circumstances of the offense, the member’s record and
     potential for future service, and take prompt action to initiate discharge or waiver action
     in accordance with the following paragraphs:
         5.55.3.1.1. If discharge action is warranted, it must be started promptly. However,
         there is no time limit for initiating discharge action, and failure to do so does not at
         anytime constitute a constructive waiver. Discharge action is waived only if a waiver
         is expressly approved under Chapter 6, Section 6L.
         5.55.3.1.2. If the commander determines a waiver of discharge action is appropriate,
         a request for waiver must be processed promptly. See Chapter 6, Section 6L.
     5.55.3.2. Retention Criteria and Consideration.
         5.55.3.2.1. A member found to have committed sexual assault or sexual assault of a
         child will be discharged unless the member meets all of the following criteria:
            5.55.3.2.1.1. The conduct surrounding and including the sexual assault or sexual
            assault of a child is a departure from the member’s usual and customary behavior.
            5.55.3.2.1.2. The conduct surrounding and including the sexual assault or sexual
            assault of a child under all circumstances is not likely to recur.
            5.55.3.2.1.3. The sexual assault or sexual assault of a child did not involve the
            penetration, however slight, of the vulva or anus or mouth of another by any part
            of the body or by any object, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, or degrade
            any person or to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.
            5.55.3.2.1.4. The sexual assault or sexual assault of a child was not committed by
            (1) using force causing or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm to any
            person; (2) threatening or placing the other person in fear that any person will be
            subjected to death, grievous bodily harm, or kidnapping; (3) first rendering the
            other person unconscious; or (4) administering to the other person by force or
            threat of force, or without the knowledge or consent of the person, a drug,
            intoxicant, or other similar substance and thereby substantially impairing the
            ability of the other person to appraise or control conduct.
            5.55.3.2.1.5. The sexual assault or sexual assault of a child was not the result of
            an abuse of rank, grade, authority or position.
            5.55.3.2.1.6. Under the particular circumstances of the case, the member’s
            continued presence in the Air Force is consistent with the interest of the Air Force
            in maintaining proper discipline, good order, leadership, and morale.
            (Noncommissioned officers have special responsibilities by virtue of their status;
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                          97


             fulfill an integral role in maintaining discipline; and, therefore, must exhibit high
             standards of personal integrity, loyalty, dedication, devotion to duty and
             leadership.)
          5.55.3.2.2. In addition to the retention criteria, the board or the separation authority
          must consider the impact of the sexual assault or sexual assault of a child on the
          victim and the views of the victim on retention. The burden of proving that retention
          is warranted under each of these limited circumstances rests with the member.
          Findings regarding the existence of each of the limited circumstances warranting a
          member’s retention are required of the board or the separation authority only if:
             5.55.3.2.2.1. The member clearly and specifically raises              such limited
             circumstances.
             5.55.3.2.2.2. The board, or in the absence of a board, the separation authority
             relies upon such circumstances to justify the member’s retention.
          5.55.3.2.3. A member approved for discharge for sexual assault or sexual assault of a
          child is not eligible for probation and rehabilitation in accordance with Chapter 7.
5.56. Separation Authority:
   5.56.1. Unless an Airman who has made an unrestricted report of sexual assault requests
   review of the discharge (see paragraph 1.31), the SPCM personally approves or disapproves
   recommendations for discharge under this section processed by:
      5.56.1.1. 1 Retention except in cases under paragraph 5.54 and 5.55.
          5.56.1.1.1. Retention.

          5.56.1.2.1. Retention and action to request discharge according to paragraph 1.2 is
          not contemplated.
          5.56.1.2.2. General discharge or entry level separation and referral to the GCM
          authority for consideration of honorable discharge is not warranted according to
          paragraph 5.48
          5.56.1.2.3. If the SPCM authority is also the GCM authority, the vice commander
          may be designated, in writing, to personally act on actions listed in paragraphs
          5.56.1.1 and 5.56.1.2.
   5.56.2. The GCM authority approves or disapproves the recommendations for discharge
   under this section which are not listed in paragraph 5.56.1 This includes conditional and
   unconditional board hearing waivers for misconduct cases and cases when the SPCM
   authority is the initiating commander.
      5.56.2.1. The GCM authority must personally act on cases resulting in:
          5.56.2.1.1. Discharge under other than honorable conditions.
 98                                                                   AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


             5.56.2.1.2. An honorable discharge based on misconduct. The GCM may delegate to
             the SPCM authority to approve honorable separations when the sole evidence of
             misconduct is command-directed urinalysis results, which cannot be used for
             characterization of service, or when an administrative discharge board has
             recommended separation with an honorable discharge.
             5.56.2.1.3. Disapproval of an SPCM authority's recommendation for an honorable
             discharge for misconduct.
             5.56.2.1.4. Disapproval of the SPCM authority's recommendation for action under
             paragraph 1.2.
         5.56.2.2. The GCM authority may designate, in writing, the vice commander to act on all
         cases not requiring the personal attention of the GCM authority as listed in paragraph
         5.56.2.1.
      5.56.3. The SPCM authority can reject conditional waivers. See paragraph 6.26.

decision in the case. The preprocessing counseling and rehabilitation requirements of paragraph
5.2 do not apply.
5.59. Types of Separation. Commanders and other officials responsible for recommending or
approving discharge under this section must review and be guided by the criteria for service
characterization in Chapter 1, Section 1B. The separation will be described as an entry level
separation if the airman is in entry level status. The service of other airmen may be characterized
as honorable, general, or under other than honorable conditions. In addition, refer to paragraph
1.30. of this Instruction for special processing procedures for a service characterization under
other than honorable conditions.
5.60. Separation Authority. The GCM authority personally takes final action on

than honorable conditions. For options of the separation authority, use Table 6.12.

Section 5J—Failure in Prisoner Retraining or Rehabilitation.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                          99

delegated, in writing, to the Vice Commander, 11SUW.

5.65. Failure in the Fitness Program. Airmen who do not meet fitness standards in AFI 10-
248, Fitness Program, (formerly AFIs 40-501 and 40-502) may be discharged when the failure
in the fitness program resulted from a cause which was within their control. Follow the
procedures for failure in the fitness program according to AFI 10-248 before starting action to
discharge. Make sure the case file shows the record of those actions. NOTE: Administrative
actions commenced on or before 31 Dec 03 may be executed to completion, using this paragraph

unrestricted report of sexual assault requests review of the discharge (see paragraph 1.31), the
case will be referred to the GCM authority.
2. If the SPCM authority is also the GCM authority, the vice commander may be designated, in
writing, to personally act on this action.
3. In rare cases a less severe type of discharge may be warranted. In such circumstances the
separation of an airman from entry level status may be described as an entry level
separation and other airmen may receive general discharges. The separation authority’s
letter directing the type of separation will give the reason for the more favorable action.

                   PROCEDURES FOR INVOLUNTARY DISCHARGE

Section 6A—Processing Guidelines

6.1. Separation or Retention. If processing is not mandatory, the initiating commander, the
board members, and the separation authority must think of the member's potential for future
useful service. This is most important in a case where the member's prior service has been good.
If separation is warranted, they may find that execution of the discharge should be suspended
according to Chapter 7. The facts and circumstances are different in each action and must be
judged on a case-by-case basis.
   6.1.1. The decision to discharge or retain a member should be consistent with the Air Force
   policy explained in paragraph 1.5 Before deciding, fully consider all the factors that make
   the member subject to discharge, including:
       6.1.1.1. The seriousness of the circumstances that make the airman subject to discharge
       and how the airman's retention might affect military discipline, good order, and morale.
       6.1.1.2. Whether the circumstances that are the basis of the discharge action will
       continue or recur.
       6.1.1.3. The likelihood that the member will be a disruptive or undesirable influence in
       present or future duty assignments.
       6.1.1.4. The member's ability to perform duties effectively in the present and in the
       future.
       6.1.1.5. The member's potential for advancement and leadership.
       6.1.1.6. Evaluation of the member's military record must include, but need not be limited
       to:
           6.1.1.6.1. Records of nonjudicial punishment.
           6.1.1.6.2. Records of counseling.
           6.1.1.6.3. Letters of reprimand or admonition.
           6.1.1.6.4. Records of conviction by courts-martial.
           6.1.1.6.5. Records of involvement with civilian authorities.
           6.1.1.6.6. Past contributions to the Air Force.
           6.1.1.6.7. Duty assignments and EPRs.
           6.1.1.6.8. Awards, decorations, and letters of commendation.
           6.1.1.6.9. The effectiveness of preprocessing rehabilitation as prescribed by
           paragraphs 1.5 and 5.2.
 106                                                                 AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


   6.1.2. Commanders, board members, or discharge authorities will consider facts they find to
   be material and relevant. Their specialized training, duties, and experience enable them to
   weigh such matters in making recommendations and decisions under this regulation.
   6.1.3. Isolated incidents and events that are remote in time have little probative value in
   determining whether the member should be discharged. Cases in which the circumstances
   may warrant the use of records from prior enlistments are ordinarily limited to those where
   patterns of conduct or duty performance show up only over a long period of time. The
   successful completion of a period of service is a fact that is usually evaluated without
   reference to material held in the master personnel record (MPerR).
       6.1.3.1. Records of adverse material from a prior enlistment or period of service should
       be considered only if such records would have a direct, strong probative value in the case.
       HQ AFMPC, Records Management Division (DPMDOA), provides copies of documents
       from, or information about, prior service on request.
   6.1.4. Unit commanders should confer on their proposed course of action with the MPF and
   servicing staff judge advocate who will review the supporting file and advise on the
   appropriate course of action.
6.2. Procedural Requirements:
   6.2.1. Mandatory Action. The fact that there is a basis for discharge under Chapter 5 does
   not make discharge processing mandatory unless the reason is:
       6.2.1.1. Sexual assault or sexual assault of a child, unless there is an approved waiver
       under the provisions of Section 6L.
       6.2.1.2. Fraudulent or erroneous enlistment unless there is an approved waiver under the
       provisions of Section 6C.
       6.2.1.3. Civil court conviction unless there is an approved waiver under the provisions of
       Section 6H.
       6.2.1.4. Drug abuse, unless there is an approved waiver under the provisions of Section
       6K.
   6.2.2. Board Hearing. Airmen recommended for discharge for a reason in Chapter 5 must
   be offered an opportunity for a hearing by an administrative discharge board if one or more
   of the conditions listed below applies:
       6.2.2.1. The respondent is an NCO at the time discharge processing starts.
       6.2.2.2. The respondent has 6 years or more total active and inactive military service at
       the time the discharge processing starts. This includes service in the delayed enlistment
       program (DEP). The disposition board hearing meets this requirement for cases processed
       under Chapter 5, Section 5J.
       6.2.2.3. An under other than honorable conditions discharge is recommended.
       6.2.2.4. DELETED.
       6.2.2.5. Discharge in the interest of national security is recommended.
       6.2.2.6. The respondent is a commissioned or warrant officer of the USAFR.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                         107


   6.2.3. Notification Procedure. Use the notification procedure in Section 6B if the offer of a
   board is not required under paragraph 6.2.2
   6.2.4. Additional Processing. To find whether the circumstances of the case make
   additional processing necessary, use Table 6.1, before discharge processing starts. Comply
   with these requirements for members who qualify at any time before discharge. Refer to
   Section 6I and Section 6J if the reason for discharge is civilian conviction or unauthorized
   absence.
6.3. Medical Examinations. Airmen recommended for involuntary discharge are given a
standard examination IAW 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards, Chapter 8. The
examination must document specifically the medical aspects pertaining to the reason(s) for the
discharge action. EXAMPLE: Reference paragraph 5.26.6., document that there is not a
medical condition that would preclude the member from meeting fitness program standards. In
addition, the medical examination must indicate whether the Airman is or is not medically
qualified for worldwide service and separation. See Table 6.2. of this Instruction, AFI 36-2102,
Base-Level Relocation Procedures and AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards, for
more information. Also, add the report of medical examination to the case file as soon as it is
complete. The enlistment medical examination meets this requirement if it is still valid and
reason for discharge does not involve misconduct or another reason that may lead to a discharge
under other than honorable conditions. In addition, refer to paragraph 1.30 of this Instruction for
discharge under other than honorable conditions. If discharge processing in absentia is
authorized, the medical examination is not required.
   6.3.1. DELETED.
6.4. Enlisted Performance Report (EPR):
   6.4.1. An EPR is required for separation cases involving parenthood (paragraph 5.9),
   conditions that interfere with military service (paragraph 5.11), unsatisfactory performance
   (paragraphs 5.25 and 5.26) or failure in the fitness program (paragraph 5.65). For A1C and
   below with less than 20 months’ Total Active Federal Military Service (TAFMS), AFI 36-
   2403 requires a mandatory letter of evaluation (LOE) in lieu of an EPR.
       6.4.1.1. Complete an EPR if the airman has not had an EPR closing in the 90 days before
       the day discharge action starts, and the period of supervision has been 60 days or more. If
       it is less than 60 days, the commander must explain the absence of the EPR in the
       commander's recommendation.
       6.4.1.2. The EPR or LOE must close out within 90 days before the discharge action
       starts.
       6.4.1.3. The initiating commander notifies the MPF if an EPR or LOE is required.
       6.4.1.4. Complete an LOE if the airman has not had an LOE closing in the 90 days
       before the discharge action starts to document the requirements of paragraph 6.4.1.
   6.4.2. The initiating commander may direct that an EPR be submitted according to AFI 36-
   2403 (formerly AFR 39-62) on other separation cases.
6.5. Information Received After Discharge Action Starts:
108                                                                AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


  6.5.1. Unfavorable Information. More evidence about the reason for discharge may be
  found after discharge action starts. In some cases, there may be new information about the
  reasons for discharge. If the evidence or information could materially affect the outcome of
  the case, the commander immediately gives the member an addendum to the original
  notification letter. The addendum states the substance of the new evidence or reasons for
  discharge. This letter must tell the member again to consult legal counsel and that statements
  in rebuttal may be submitted.
      6.5.1.1. If board proceedings are not involved, the initiating commander notifies the
      SPCM authority at once and sends a copy of the addendum, the new evidence, and any
      statements submitted by the respondent to the SPCM authority for consideration.
         6.5.1.1.1. The separation authority may consider the new evidence or reason for
         discharge an integral part of the discharge case if a final decision has not been made.
         It may be a basis for returning the case to the commander to start new discharge
         proceedings.
         6.5.1.1.2. If the final decision has been made, the separation authority may not
         change the decision to make it less favorable to the airman. However, the separation
         authority may change the decision to one of retention, thus terminating the action. In
         such a case, the separation authority may also return the case to the initiating
         commander for use in a new administrative discharge action. For limitations on using
         the material to establish a basis for discharge, see paragraph 5.4.3.
      6.5.1.2. If board proceedings are involved and the board has not reached its findings and
      recommendations, the commander notifies the SPCM authority at once, and then sends a
      copy of the addendum to the SPCM authority. The new evidence or additional reasons for
      discharge and the member's statements are included. The SPCM authority may:
         6.5.1.2.1. Refer the new material to the board. The board may consider it, if the
         airman is given the right to defend against it. The same rules of evidence and
         procedures applicable to other evidence before the board apply to the new evidence.
         6.5.1.2.2. Elect not to refer the new material to the board. If so, it may not be
         considered in the pending action or used later as a basis to start other administrative
         discharge proceedings.
      6.5.1.3. If the board has closed after announcing its findings and recommendations, the
      new evidence and additional reasons for discharge:
         6.5.1.3.1. May not be referred to the board.
         6.5.1.3.2. May be sent to the separation authority with the record of the board
         proceedings. The commander notifies the separation authority at once and sends a
         copy of the addendum to the notification letter and the respondent's reply. The
         separation authority may consider the information but may not take any
         administrative action less favorable to the respondent than recommended by the board
         and authorized for the reason for discharge.
             6.5.1.3.2.1. However, if the decision is to retain the member, the new material
             may be returned to the initiating commander for use in a new administrative
             action.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                           109


               6.5.1.3.2.2. Further, if the decision is to discharge the member, the separation
               authority may change the decision to one of retention, thus terminating the
               separation action. In such cases, the separation authority may also return the case
               to the initiating commander for use in a new administrative discharge action.
               6.5.1.3.2.3. For limitations on using the material to establish a basis for
               discharge, see paragraph 5.4.3.
           6.5.1.3.3. May be considered in a new action referred to a second board according to
           Table 6.3.
   6.5.2. Favorable Information. The initiating commander sends the new information to the
   member, member's counsel, and the SPCM authority for submission to the separation
   authority.
6.6. Preparation of Recommendations for Discharge. Make enough copies so the original
and one copy with all attachments, will reach the separation authority. Make sure a copy is
available for the member (reference Table 1.5, line M). List all the reasons or allegations on
which the action is based and the circumstances upon which each is based in the body of the
letter of notification signed by the initiating commander. Use the organizational letterhead,
printed or typed, for letters recommending or approving discharge.
6.7. Processing Time Goals. It is usually in the best interest of both the member and the Air
Force to process the case without delay. This does not mean that the respondent's rights can be
denied in any way. Neither does it mean that the Air Force case should be less than complete.
Processing time will vary because of local circumstances. It will be affected by location, the
availability of counsel, court reporting capability, processing a referral EPR, the need for referral
to the Air Force physical disability system, or other special processing requirements. Average
total processing times are shown in Table 6.4.
   6.7.1. The SPCM authority sets local processing time standards for each agency involved to
   make sure that all their actions are usually completed within the Air Force goals. MAJCOMs
   will monitor the effectiveness of airman separation programs under their control to make sure
   cases are being processed within the goals established by Table 6.4. Failure to meet the
   suggested time standards does not affect the validity of the action.

Section 6B—Notification Procedures.

6.8. Use and Purpose. To find when a recommendation for discharge will be processed by
notification, see paragraph 6.2. Under this procedure, the member has the right to:
   6.8.1. Receive written notice of the reasons, including the circumstances upon which the
   action is based, for discharge and the least favorable type of separation authorized.
   6.8.2. Copies of the documents to be forwarded to the separation authority in support of the
   recommendation.
   6.8.3. Consult counsel.
   6.8.4. Submit statements in rebuttal.
   6.8.5. Waive the rights in bullets 3 and 4 above.
 110                                                                   AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


6.9. Action by the Initiating Commander. The initiating commander takes immediate action
on individuals under personnel reliability program (PRP) for their permanent decertification
prior to discharge (AFI 36-2104 (formerly AFR 35-99)). In all separation actions, the
commander will:
   6.9.1. Notify the MPF if an EPR is required, see paragraph 6.4. The initiating commander
   may direct that an EPR be rendered according to AFI 36-2403 (formerly AFR 39-62) on
   other separation cases.
   6.9.2. Obtains military legal counsel to assist the airman. Counsel must be qualified under
   UCMJ, Article 27(b) (1).
   6.9.3. Schedules the airman for a medical examination and tells the medical facility the
   reason for the recommended discharge. For more information, see paragraph 6.3
   EXCEPTION: This examination is not required when the enlistment physical is still valid.
   NOTE: Commanders may schedule the member for a separation physical upon making the
   initial decision to initiate separation, prior to serving the member with a letter of notification
   of discharge.
   6.9.4. Gives the airman written notice of the proposed discharge. Figure 6.1 is a sample
   format for the notification letter for airmen in entry level status. Use the format in Figure 6.2
   for other airmen. Attach documents reflecting derogatory information, such as demotions,
   time lost, record of disciplinary actions, enlisted performance reports (EPR), and derogatory
   data (reference Figure 6.5, paragraphs 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, and 2.12), if applicable. Provide
   an advance information copy of the notification letter without attachments to the MPF
   Separations Unit for suspense and internal MPF coordination.
   6.9.5. Advises the airman that an involuntary discharge makes an individual ineligible for
   reenlistment in the Air Force and will probably preclude enlistment in any component of the
   armed forces.
   6.9.6. Advises the airman where a copy of this instruction may be found for use while the
   case is being processed.
   6.9.7. Obtains a receipt for the notification letter. For a sample format of the receipt for
   notification letter, use Figure 6.3.
   6.9.8. Obtains the airman's statement or statements within 3 workdays. For a sample format
   of the airman's statement, use Figure 6.4 NOTE: If the airman does not sign this statement,
   the commander annotates the letter to show whether the member indicated that any of the
   rights would be exercised.
   6.9.9. Prepares a recommendation to the SPCM authority as shown in Figure 6.5.
   6.9.10. Sends the case file to the servicing MPF for further processing. At this point the case
   file should contain the:
       6.9.10.1. Commander's recommendation with attachments (listed below).
       6.9.10.2. Copy of the notification letter with attachments (paragraph 6.8 second bullet
       and Figure 6.1 or 6.2).
       6.9.10.3. Addendum to notification letter (if applicable).
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                        111


       6.9.10.4. Airman's receipt of notification letter (Figure 6.3).
       6.9.10.5. Airman's statement with or without attachments (see Figure 6.4 and note in
       paragraph 6.9.8).
       6.9.10.6. Medical examination (if available).
       6.9.10.7. Other documents, if applicable.
   6.9.11. Notifies the local Financial Services Office (FSO), in writing, as soon as the
   discharge is initiated. The letter should request the FSO notify you if member is indebted to
   the government and what action will be taken to collect the debt. Use AFI 36-2102 (formerly
   AFR 35-17), as an example, to notify local base agencies of discharge initiation. If discharge
   is disapproved, re-notify appropriate agencies.
   6.9.12. For members who are convicted by court-martial and do not receive a punitive
   discharge, consideration should be given to the initiation of involuntary separation action
   under this directive. If action is taken to separate, this should be done prior to the
   confinement facility requesting transfer to the HQ AFSPA/SPC. There is sufficient time
   between the adjudged date and the action of the convening authority to initiate separation
   action.
6.10. Action by the Member. The member:
   6.10.1. Acknowledges receipt of the notification letter in a statement made according to
   Figure 6.3. If the member does not respond or responds without signing the statement
   provided, the commander will make an appropriate notation on the statement regarding the
   member's failure to do so.
   6.10.2. Reports for the medical examination as directed.
   6.10.3. Consults the appointed military legal counsel.
   6.10.4. Submits statements by the date set in the notification letter or declines the
   opportunity to do so. The commander may give the member more time if there is good
   reason for the request. Failure by the member to respond within 3 workdays or by the end of
   an approved extension constitutes a waiver of the member's rights. For a format of the
   airman's statement, use Figure 6.4. If the member does not respond or responds without
   signing the statement provided, the commander will make an appropriate notation on the
   statement regarding the member's failure to do so.
6.11. Action by the MPF. MPF Personnel Relocation Element makes sure the case file
contains all required documents, including the medical examination when it is completed. Ensure
the staff judge advocate's legal review is included as an attachment to the separation authority's
letter. Don't delay processing to wait for the medical examination report. The MPF Personnel
Relocation Element Unit makes sure the separation, if approved, is not executed until the
member is found qualified for worldwide duty or the processing required by Section 6E is
complete.
6.12. Action by the SPCM Authority. The SPCM authority is the separation authority for
cases processed by notification. EXCEPTIONS: GCM approval is required when an honorable
discharge is recommended for misconduct, when an Airman who has made an unrestricted report
 112                                                                  AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


of a sexual assault requests review of the discharge (see paragraph 1.31), or when the SPCM
authority wants to retain an Airman recommended for discharge under paragraph 5.54 or 5.55.
   6.12.1. On receipt of the case the SPCM authority:
       6.12.1.1. Obtains a review for legal sufficiency and adds it to the case file.
       EXCEPTION: The review for legal sufficiency is not required if the reason for discharge
       is entry level performance and conduct under Chapter 5, Section 5D.
       6.12.1.2. Determines whether the facts of the case meet the criteria for the reason cited in
       the letter of notification. An allegation that is not supported by a preponderance of the
       evidence may not be used as a basis for separation.
       6.12.1.3. Directs reinitiation for processing according to Section 6C if the issuance of an
       under other than honorable conditions discharge may be warranted.
   6.12.2. If the reason for discharge is erroneous enlistment according to paragraph 5.14, the
   SPCM authority may:
       6.12.2.1. Approve or disapprove the recommended discharge and direct retention.
   6.12.3. In all other cases, the SPCM authority decides whether separation is warranted
   according to paragraph 6.1 and approves discharge or retention. If discharge is approved,
   the SPCM authority also decides:
       6.12.3.1. How the service will be characterized if the reason for discharge permits the
       issuance of a general discharge.
       6.12.3.2. Whether the member should be offered probation and rehabilitation according
       to Chapter 7.
       6.12.3.3. Which reason will be cited as the primary reason for discharge if more than one
       reason is involved. The separation will be reported on the reason designated as the
       primary reason.
   6.12.4. If the initiating commander recommends an honorable discharge and the separation
   authority approves a general discharge, the approval letter must cite the specific aspects of
   the military record that warrant the general discharge.

Section 6C—Board Hearing or Board Waiver.

6.13. Procedural Rights:
   6.13.1. An airman recommended for discharge under Chapter 5 and entitled to a board
   hearing according to paragraph 6.2 has the right to:
       6.13.1.1. Receive written notice of the reasons for discharge, including the circumstances
       upon which each reason is based, and the least favorable type of separation authorized.
       6.13.1.2. Receive copies of the documents to be forwarded to the separation authority in
       support of the recommendation for discharge.
       6.13.1.3. Consult counsel. Military legal counsel will be detailed to assist the respondent.
       6.13.1.4. Request a hearing before an administrative discharge board.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                         113


      6.13.1.5. Present written statements in addition to, or in lieu of, the board proceedings.
      6.13.1.6. Be represented before the board by Area Defense Counsel assigned to the

      determined according to AFI 51-201, Military Justice Guide (formerly AFR 111-1).
      6.13.1.7. Be represented before the board by civilian counsel. Civilian counsel may be
      employed at the member's own expense.
      6.13.1.8. Waive any of the above rights.
   6.13.2. The airman must be given written notice of these rights and will be required to
   respond indicating which rights will be exercised and which, if any, will be waived. The
   written notice must advise that a member's failure to respond after being given a reasonable
   opportunity to consult counsel constitutes a waiver of the rights in paragraphs 6.13.1 except
   first two bullets.
      6.13.2.1. The notice should also advise that, should a board hearing be requested, the
      member's failure to appear constitutes a waiver of the right to be present at the hearing.
      NOTE: The failure to respond will be noted on the original or copy of the written notice
      given to the airman and in the correspondence forwarded to the separation authority for
      decision.
   6.13.3. A board must be convened to hear the case when:
      6.13.3.1. The member requests the hearing.
      6.13.3.2. The convening authority declines to accept a conditional or unconditional
      waiver of the hearing.
      6.13.3.3. The member is a Reserve commissioned officer on active duty as an enlisted
      member of the Regular Air Force. For more information about these cases, see Section
      6G.
      6.13.3.4. The respondent is absent in civil confinement and does not submit a written
      waiver of the board hearing. For more information about special procedures for these
      cases, see paragraph 6.22.
6.14. Action by the Initiating Commander:
   6.14.1. Notifies the MPF if an EPR is required, see paragraph 6.4 The initiating
   commander may direct that an EPR be rendered according to AFI 36-2403 (Formerly AFR
   39-62) on other separation cases.
   6.14.2. Obtains military legal counsel qualified under UCMJ, Article 27(b)(1) to assist the
   airman.
   6.14.3. Schedules a medical examination (paragraph 6.3) for the airman, and tells the
   medical facility the reason for the discharge recommendation.
   6.14.4. Notifies the airman of the proposed discharge in a letter prepared according to the
   format in Figure 6.6 Attach documents reflecting derogatory information, which are not
   listed in the notification letter, such as demotion, time lost, record of disciplinary actions,
   enlisted performance reports (EPR) and derogatory data (use Figure 6.5, paragraphs 2.7,
114                                                                   AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


  2.8, 2.9, 2.10, and 2.12), if applicable. Provides an advance information copy of the
  notification letter without attachments to MPF Personnel Relocation Element for suspense
  and internal MPF coordination.
  6.14.5. Advises the airman that an involuntary discharge makes an individual ineligible for
  reenlistment in the Air Force and will probably deny enlistment in any component of the
  armed forces.
  6.14.6. Advises the airman where a copy of this instruction may be found for use while the
  case is being processed.
  6.14.7. Obtains the airman's acknowledgment (use Figure 6.7).
  6.14.8. Obtains the airman's response with or without attachments (use Figure 6.8), or
  6.14.9. Obtains airman's statement of conditional waiver with or without attachments (use
  Figure 6.9). If the airman does not respond or responds without signing the statement
  provided, the commander will make an appropriate notation on the statement regarding the
  member's failure to do so, or
  6.14.10. Obtains application for retirement (if applicable) within 7 workdays.
 6.14.11. Prepares a recommendation to the convening authority. For a sample format, use
 Figure 6.5.
 6.14.12. Sends the case file through the servicing MPF, to the convening authority. At this
 point the case file should contain the:
      6.14.12.1. Commander's recommendation with attachments (listed below),
      6.14.12.2. Copy of the notification letter with attachments (use Figure 6.6),
      6.14.12.3. Addendum to notification letter (if applicable),
      6.14.12.4. Airman's statement, with or without attachments (use Figure 6.8), or
      6.14.12.5. Airman's statement of conditional waiver with or without attachments (use
      Figure 6.9), or
      6.14.12.6. Application for retirement (if applicable),
      6.14.12.7. Medical examination (if available), and
      6.14.12.8. Other documents (if applicable).
  6.14.13. Notify the local FSO, in writing, as soon as the discharge is initiated and request the
  FSO notify you if member is indebted to the government and what action will be taken to
  collect the debt. Use AFI 36-2102 (formerly AFR 35-17), as an example, to notify local base
  agencies of discharge initiation. If the discharge is disapproved, renotify appropriate
  agencies.
  6.14.14. For members who are convicted by court-martial and do not receive a punitive
  discharge, consider initiating involuntary separation under this directive. If action is taken to
  separate, this should be done prior to the confinement facility requesting transfer to the HQ
  AFSPA/SPC. There is sufficient time between the adjudged date and action of the convening
  authority to initiate separation action.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                          115


6.15. Action by the Member:
   6.15.1. Acknowledges receipt of the notification letter. For a sample format, use Figure 6.7
   6.15.2. Consults the appointed military legal counsel.
   6.15.3. Reports for the medical examination as directed.
   6.15.4. Responds within 7 workdays after receiving the notification letter. Failure by the
   member to respond within 7 workdays or an approved extension, constitutes a waiver of the
   member's rights. The response tells the unit commander whether the member wants a hearing
   before an administrative discharge board or waives this right. Use Figure 6.8, as a format for
   the letter. NOTE: A member may conditionally waive a board hearing contingent on receipt
   of a specific type of discharge. Use Figure 6.9, as a format for this letter. For more
   information about conditional waivers, see Section 6D.
6.16. Action by the MPF. MPF Personnel Relocation Element makes sure the case file
contains all required documents, including the medical examination when it is completed. Ensure
the staff judge advocate's legal review is included as an attachment to the separation authority's
letter. Don't delay processing to wait for the report of the medical examination. The MPF
Personnel Relocation Element makes sure the separation, if approved, is not executed until the
member is found qualified for worldwide duty or the processing required by Section 6E is
completed.
6.17. Action by the Convening Authority:
   6.17.1. On receipt of the case from the MPF, the convening authority examines it and
   complies with Table 6.5.
   6.17.2. On receipt of administrative discharge board proceedings, the convening authority:
   6.17.3. Makes sure that any special processing requirements are met. For more information,
   use Table 6.1.
   6.17.4. Obtains a review for legal sufficiency from the staff judge advocate and adds it to the
   case file;
   6.17.5. Examines the report to make sure that the findings and recommendations are
   appropriate.
   6.17.6. Takes final action on the case, if referral to the GCM authority is not required and
   further action to request discharge according to paragraph 1.2 is not contemplated; or
   6.17.7. Sends the complete file to the GCM authority with a recommendation for disposition.
   If the convening authority does not concur in the board’s recommendations, the reason for
   nonconcurrence must be explained in the forwarding correspondence.
6.18. Action by the Administrative Discharge Board. For board procedures and authorized
actions, use Chapter 8 and Table 6.6.
   6.18.1. The board must:
       6.18.1.1. Decide whether each allegation set forth in the notification letter or additions to
       it, is supported by a preponderance of the evidence.
       6.18.1.2. Make a separate finding with regard to each allegation.
 116                                                                     AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


       6.18.1.3. Determine whether findings warrant separation with respect to the reasons set
       forth in the letter of notification. If the letter of notification cites more than one reason for
       separation, there shall be a separate determination for each reason. For guidance in these
       matters, see paragraphs 5.1 and 6.1.
       6.18.1.4. Recommend discharge or retention.
   6.18.2. If the board recommends discharge, it must also:
       6.18.2.1. Apply the criteria in Chapter 1, Section 1B, and recommend a type of
       separation authorized according to Chapter 5.
       6.18.2.2. Make a recommendation concerning suspension of discharge in any case where
       it is authorized. For information about P&R, see Chapter 7. A recommendation for P&R
       is not binding on the separation authority.
       6.18.2.3. DELETED.
6.19. Action by the Separation Authority. To find who the separation authority is, refer to the
authorizing section of Chapter 5. The separation authority:
   6.19.1. Obtains a review for legal sufficiency from the staff judge advocate;
   6.19.2. Adds the legal review to the case file; and
   6.19.3. Takes final action on the case according to Table 6.7, Table 6.8, Table 6.9, Table
   6.10, Table 6.11, or Table 6.12.
   6.19.4. Determines which is the primary reason, if the member is subject to discharge for
   more than one reason. The type of separation must be one that is authorized for the reason
   named. The separation will be reported on that reason.
   6.19.5. DELETED.
6.20. Withdrawal of the Board Waiver. Airmen who have waived the right to a board hearing
may request withdrawal of the waiver in writing.
   6.20.1. The member states the reason and sends the request to the convening authority
   through the MPF Personnel Relocation Element.
   6.20.2. The convening authority approves withdrawal of a waiver not yet referred to the
   separation authority.
   6.20.3. The separation authority may approve or disapprove all other requests for withdrawal
   regardless of the status of the case.
   6.20.4. The separation authority makes the decision on the merit, or lack of merit, in each
   case.
6.21. Referral to a New Board. The separation authority may set aside the findings and
recommendations of an administrative discharge board and refer the matter to a new board only
as provided in Table 6.3.
6.22. Airmen Not Present for the Board Hearing:
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                           117


   6.22.1. Whereabouts Unknown. The restrictions of paragraph 1.12 apply. Chapter 5
   contains instructions that apply, if the reason for discharge is civilian conviction, fraudulent
   enlistment, or unauthorized absence.
   6.22.2. Whereabouts Known. The restrictions of paragraph 1.12 apply. In some
   circumstances, airmen whose whereabouts are known may not be available to be present at a
   board hearing. This might occur when the respondent is in civil confinement. In such cases,
   send the notice of the proposed discharge by certified mail, return receipt requested. Change
   the notification memorandum (Figure 6.6) to explain the special procedures applicable to in
   absentia discharge processing.
       6.22.2.1. Omit instructions about a medical examination.
       6.22.2.2. Tell the member that:
           6.22.2.2.1. If a board hearing is desired, it will be held in the member's absence.
           6.22.2.2.2. Military legal counsel will be appointed to represent the member before
           the board.
           6.22.2.2.3. If discharge is approved, it may be executed in absentia.
       6.22.2.3. Allow 30 calendar days from the date of delivery of notice (longer if special
       circumstances warrant) for a reply.
       6.22.2.4. Consider failure to reply within the allotted time a waiver of board hearing, if
       there is proof of delivery of the notification letter and the airman is absent without
       authority.
       6.22.2.5. Convene a board to hear the case at the end of the prescribed period if:
           6.22.2.5.1. There is no proof of delivery of the notification letter or
           6.22.2.5.2. A member in civil confinement has not replied.
6.23. Witnesses for the Board Hearing. The commander, with the help of a staff judge
advocate, must determine the separation or reassignment status of each prospective witness. As a
rule, witnesses should not be reassigned from the jurisdiction of the MAJCOM until they are no
longer needed. Take depositions from essential witnesses who will not be available when the
board meets. Keep the depositions for later use in the board hearing. For more information about
how to arrange for witnesses, see Chapter 8.

Section 6D—Conditional Waiver of Board Hearing.

6.24. Options Explained. A conditional waiver is a statement made by a member who gives up
the rights associated with the administrative discharge board proceedings. The waiver is
contingent on the receipt of a type of separation more favorable than the least favorable
authorized for any basis for separation set forth in the letter of notification. Only the type of
separation may be addressed in a conditional waiver.
   6.24.1. For example, in a case based on unsatisfactory performance, the least favorable
   service characterization is under honorable conditions (GENERAL). The conditional waiver
   would ask for an honorable discharge. In a misconduct case, the member could be discharged
   under other than honorable conditions. The waiver might be contingent on the receipt of an
 118                                                                 AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


   honorable or a general discharge. It must specify one or the other. The waiver may not be
   conditioned on P&R or be conditioned on approval of discharge for a specific reason.
6.25. Offer by the Member. The member submits the conditional waiver to the unit
commander for the convening authority to review. The member asks for no less than a specific
type of separation. For conditional waiver format, use Figure 6.9 The case file considered by the
convening authority contains the commander's recommendation (with attachments that include
the conditional waiver)
6.26. Acceptance or Rejection:
   6.26.1. The convening authority may:
       6.26.1.1. Reject the conditional waiver and tell the member that either an unconditional
       waiver or a request for a board hearing may be submitted. If the member fails to respond
       within 3 workdays or by the end of an approved extension, a board hearing will be
       convened (paragraph 6.28).
       6.26.1.2. Recommend acceptance of the conditional waiver and send it to the separation
       authority for decision. The letter to the separation authority must tell why the waiver
       should be accepted. It must tell how the member's military record warrants the issuance
       of the type of discharge the airman requests. NOTE: If the convening authority is also
       the separation authority, this step is omitted and action is taken according to paragraph
       6.26.2 (second bullet).
   6.26.2. The separation authority may:
       6.26.2.1. Reject the conditional waiver. Processing then continues according to Section
       6C.
       6.26.2.2. Accept the conditional waiver and approve the type of separation specified in
       it, or a better type. The approval letter signed by the separation authority, must tell how
       the member's military record warrants the type of separation approved.
6.27. Withdrawal of a Conditional Waiver. The member may send a written request for
withdrawal of the conditional waiver to the convening authority through the MPF. The request
must give the reason for the withdrawal. The convening authority approves the withdrawal of a
waiver not yet referred to the separation authority. The separation authority may approve or
disapprove all other requests for withdrawal regardless of the status of the case. The separation
authority makes the decision on the merit, or lack of merit, in each case.
6.28. Action After a Conditional Waiver is Rejected:
   6.28.1. The member requests a board hearing or submits an unconditional waiver of a board
   hearing. If the member fails to respond within 3 workdays or by the end of an approved
   extension, a board hearing will be convened. For the format of the unconditional waiver, use
   Figure 6.8 A second conditional waiver will not be accepted.
   6.28.2. Processing continues without reference to, or consideration of, the rejected
   conditional waiver. The fact that a conditional waiver was offered and rejected must not be
   made a part of the record shown to the administrative discharge board. Conditional waiver
   will be withdrawn from the commander's recommendation for discharge.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                           119


   6.28.3. After the separation authority acts on the case, the MPF adds the conditional waiver
   correspondence to the file. It will show when the waiver was submitted and when it was
   rejected. This will account for what might seem to be delays in processing.
6.29. Action When a Conditional Waiver is Accepted. The acceptance of a conditional
waiver of the board hearing does not change any other right of the respondent. The case must be
reviewed for legal sufficiency by the staff judge advocate for the separation authority. The
separation authority decides whether P&R should be offered. The conditional waiver
correspondence is part of the case file and stays with it.

Section 6E—Dual Action Processing.

6.30. When Dual Action is Required. Dual action processing involves referral of separation
action to the Air Force Personnel Council (AFPC). It is required when an airman subject to
involuntary discharge under this regulation also:
   6.30.1. Is eligible to apply for retirement (20 years or more active service creditable for
   retirement) according to AFI 36-3203, Service Retirements (formerly AFR 35-7) and applies
   for retirement;
   6.30.2. Is eligible for disability separation or disability retirement after separation according
   to AFR 36-2902 (formerly AFR 35-4) Exception: See paragraph 1.10.3.
6.31. Airmen Not Qualified for Worldwide Duty. When the required medical examination
(paragraph 6.3) shows that the airman is not qualified for worldwide duty, comply with Table
6.13 and Table 6.14 These cases should be closely monitored to insure a discharge under this
instructions is not executed before the AFI 36-2902 (formerly AFR 35-4) case has been
completed.
6.32. Service Retirement Eligibility. Airmen who are qualified for retirement according to
AFI 36-3203 (formerly AFR 35-7) may be permitted to retire.
   6.32.1. If discharge action is initiated against an airman who has applied for retirement,
   notify HQ AFMPC/ DPMARR2 at once. Give airmen who have not applied for retirement
   the chance to apply for retirement if they are retirement eligible at the time discharge starts or
   if they attain retirement eligibility after discharge action starts. (See Table 6.15, note 1).
   6.32.2. The notification letter tells the airman he/she may submit a retirement application.
   For a sample of the information the commander adds to the letter, use Figure 6.10.
6.33. Action When the Respondent Applies. For instructions, use Table 6.15 and Table 6.16.
6.34. Action When the Respondent Does Not Apply. Process the discharge action to
completion in the usual way, if the member does not apply for retirement. If it results in
retention, no further action is necessary. If it results in approval for discharge, the servicing MPF
notifies HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2 and does not execute the discharge until they get a reply.

Section 6F—Airmen with Lengthy Service.

6.35. Procedures Explained. This is an airman who has completed at least 16 but less than 20
years' active service creditable toward retirement at the time discharge action starts. These
airmen, nearing retirement eligibility, are entitled to special consideration for probation upon
 120                                                                 AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


their request. This section applies only to them. They are not discharged until their cases have
been referred to HQ AFMPC/ DPMARS2 for further review according to procedures set forth
below (see note). If that review results in an offer of probation, the terms of the probation for
each case will be set out in the authorizing correspondence. NOTE: Approved discharge will be
executed if member does not request review.
6.36. Referral Required. Upon request, withhold the execution of the approved discharge.
Send the original and one copy of the case with the separation authority's recommendation for
lengthy service probation through the MAJCOM director of personnel (DP) to HQ
AFMPC/DPMARS2, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4713, for review and further processing if the:
   6.36.1. Separation authority cannot or does not offer P&R according to Chapter 7;
   6.36.2. Airman does not accept P&R offered according to Chapter 7;
   6.36.3. Separation authority approves revocation of the suspension of a discharge according
   to paragraph 7.12; or
   6.36.4. Separation authority concurs in a recommendation for revocation of a suspension
   authorized under this section.
6.37. MAJCOM Review. The parent MAJCOM/DP makes comments and recommendations
and sends a copy of their recommendations and legal review to the servicing MAJCOM/DP for
information purposes.
6.38. Disposition of the Case. HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2 gives specific instructions. These may
include but are not limited to:
   6.38.1. An offer of probation for the time the airman needs to get minimum retirement
   eligibility according to AFI 36-3203(formerly AFR 35-7);
   6.38.2. An offer of P&R for a specific period of time according to Chapter 7;
   6.38.3. Concurrence in the execution of the discharge; or
   6.38.4. Other action directed by the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force (OSAF).

Section 6G—Dual Status Members.

6.39. Who Has Dual Status. Enlisted members of the Regular Air Force who hold
appointments as Reserve of the Air Force commissioned officers have dual status. Discharge
processing for them must include consideration of their fitness for retention of the Reserve
appointment. The procedures in this section apply only to them.
6.40. Board Hearings. A dual status airman subject to discharge under this regulation may not
waive the board hearing. See Chapter 8 for special board membership requirements. The board,
whether it recommends retention or discharge, must also recommend whether the airman should
keep the Reserve appointment. If the board recommends discharge from both the Regular
enlistment and the Reserve appointment, the type of discharge for both must be the same. If the
board recommends discharge from the Reserve appointment but not from the Regular enlistment,
the type of discharge must be honorable or general.
6.41. Advice to the Airman. The commander's notification letter to the airman (Figure 6.6)
tells the airman that:
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                       121


   6.41.1. OSAF makes the determination if the appointment will be retained.
   6.41.2. At any time before the final decision in the case is made, the airman may:
       6.41.2.1. Apply for voluntary retirement, if eligible.
       6.41.2.2. Request transfer to the retired Reserve, if eligible.
       6.41.2.3. Tender a resignation from all appointments according to AFI 36-3209,
       Separation Procedures for Air Force Reserve Members (formerly AFR 35-41).
6.42. Completing the Action. After all actions required by this regulation are complete:
   6.42.1. Submit an application for voluntary retirement or request for transfer to the retired
   Reserve according to AFI 36-3203 (formerly AFR 35-7).
   6.42.2. Send a resignation to HQ ARPC/DPA, 6760 East Irvington Pl, Denver CO 80280-
   5000.
   6.42.3. Send the original AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen (formerly AFR
   39-10) case file to HQ ARPC/DPA if the administrative discharge board recommends
   retention of the Reserve appointment.
   6.42.4. Send the original and two copies of the AFI 36-3208 case file to HQ ARPC/DPA if
   the administrative discharge board recommends discharge from the Reserve appointment.

Section 6H—Joint Processing.

6.43. Reasons for Joint Processing. A recommendation for discharge for more than one reason
may be processed jointly as a single action. A commander may do this when the airman's
military record in the current enlistment would support discharge for more than one reason. Two
or more of the reasons for discharge in Chapter 5 may be cited as the basis of a recommendation
for discharge.
6.44. Supplemental Procedures for Joint Processing:
   6.44.1. Change the notification letter, the acknowledgment, and the airman's statement to list
   all the reasons for discharge. Cite the authority for each one.
   6.44.2. Process the case according to Section 6C if one of the reasons cited as the basis of
   the action makes the member entitled to a board hearing. The convening authority may direct
   that the board exclude one or more of the reasons from consideration as the basis of the
   discharge. If the deletion eliminates the board entitlement, process the case according to
   Section 6B.
   6.44.3. Apply the guidance on service characterization that allows the most latitude, if
   discharge for more than one reason is approved. For example, if a recommendation for
   discharge is approved for both misconduct and unsatisfactory performance, apply the criteria
   for characterization of discharge for misconduct because it allows the greater latitude.
   6.44.4. Resolve conflicts between a specific requirement applicable to one reason and a
   general requirement applicable to another by applying the specific requirement.
   6.44.5. Use the procedure most favorable to the member if a conflict in procedures cannot be
   resolved based on the above.
 122                                                                   AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


6.45. Separation Authority for Cases Processed Jointly. The GCM authority acts on the case
if any part of it processed alone would have required such referral. The SPCM authority is the
separation authority in other cases.
6.46. Reporting Separation for More Than One Reason. The separation authority complies
with paragraph 6.44 in deciding whether to approve discharge for one reason or more than one.
If the separation authority directs discharge for more than one reason, the instrument directing
discharge must cite the primary reason. The separation will be reported in PDS on that basis.
6.47. Execution of Discharge Involving Civilian Conviction. The restrictions on executing a
discharge based on a civilian conviction under appeal, or while a member is in confinement in a
foreign country, apply. See paragraphs 6.57 and 6.58 for more guidance. If the civilian
conviction is overturned on appeal, send the case back to the separation authority for action
according to the other reason or reasons.

Section 6I—Processing Airmen Dropped From Unit Rolls.

6.48. Status of Airmen. They are dropped from the rolls (DFR) of their units according to
AFMAN 36-2125 (Formerly AFR 35-40). DFR is an administrative action that does not change
the airman's status as a member of the Air Force. For information about how it applies to
deserters, see AFI 36-2911, Desertion and Unauthorized Absence (formerly AFR 35-73). The
fact that an airman was DFR as a deserter does not bar a later finding under AFI 36-2911 that the
member was only absent without leave (AWOL).
   6.48.1. The procedures in this section apply only when HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2, on a case-
   by-case basis, names a unit to process the discharge of an absentee under paragraph 5.52.
   For information about other discharge in absentia actions, see paragraph 1.12.
6.49. Eligibility for In Absentia Processing. HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2 may authorize
administrative discharge processing when:
   6.49.1. Prosecution of the member is apparently barred. For more information, see article 43,
   UCMJ.
   6.49.2. The member is an alien living in a foreign country where the United States lacks
   authority to apprehend.
6.50. Notice to the Absentee. When HQ AFMPC/ DPMARS2 authorizes discharge processing
in absentia, the letter authorizing the action tells how to adapt the procedures of Section 6C to
the case.
   6.50.1. Send it by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address of record for the
   airman or the next of kin. The receipt for the letter will serve as proof of notification. If the
   letter is returned as undeliverable, it will serve as proof of the attempt to notify the airman.
   6.50.2. The letter must tell the airman that discharge under other than honorable conditions,
   resulting from an unauthorized absence of 180 days or more, is a conditional bar to benefits
   administered by the Veterans' Administration, notwithstanding any action by the discharge
   review board. For more information, see Title 38 U.S.C., Section 5303.
   6.50.3. A medical examination is not required but may be authorized when:
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                        123


       6.50.3.1. Unique circumstances show the information developed in an examination
       might have a strong, direct bearing on the type of separation;
       6.50.3.2. The absentee is not in civil confinement; and
       6.50.3.3. Facilities for the examination of a person not under military control are
       reasonably available.
6.51. Return to Military Control. As a rule, an absentee processed for discharge according to
this section will not be permitted to return to military control. It may be authorized, however,
when HQ AFMPC/ DPMARS2 finds return to military control would serve a useful purpose. In
these cases, the letter of notification tells the airman:
   6.51.1. Processing will be suspended for at least 30 days. Cite a specific date.
   6.51.2. If the member does not return to military control by that date, the recommendation
   for discharge will be referred to the GCM authority for final decision.
6.52. Alien Absentees. As a rule, aliens discharged for prolonged unauthorized absence may
not return to the United States. Comply with AFI 36-3202 (formerly AFR 35-6) instructions for
reporting such separations to the State Department and Immigration Service officials.

Section 6J—Procedures for Cases Involving Civilian Conviction.

6.53. Commander's Responsibilities. When information is received indicating that an airman
has been the subject of action by civilian authorities, the commander must get more information
about the case at once. Figure 6.11 is the format used to ask for the information a commander
needs to determine whether the member is subject to discharge for misconduct due to civilian
conviction.
   6.53.1. If the civilian conviction involved an offense for which a punitive discharge and
   confinement for 1 year or more would be authorized for the same or closely related offense
   under the MCM, the commander must either recommend discharge or request a waiver of
   discharge processing. For other civilian court conviction cases in which the member would
   be subject to discharge according to criteria in paragraph 5.51.1, see paragraphs 5.51.3
   (first and third bullet).
   6.53.2. If there is a need to determine whether there is a record of other civil convictions in
   prior periods of service, ask HQ AFMPC/DPMDOA for information from the MPerR.
   Similarly, ask the OSI detachment to run a fingerprint check through the FBI to find whether
   there have been other offenses and how they were handled. An airman's absence in civil
   confinement is not a bar to processing a recommendation for discharge or waiver of
   discharge.
6.54. Waiver of Discharge:
   6.54.1. Some cases warrant consideration for waiver of discharge. In deciding whether a
   waiver should be recommended, give full consideration to the gravity of the specific offense
   involved, all the circumstances surrounding it, and any matters in extenuation. Review the
   airman's military record before the offense was committed and the airman's potential for
   rehabilitation.
 124                                                                   AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


       6.54.1.1. Find out what disposition would have been appropriate if the offense had
       occurred and had been resolved entirely within the Air Force community. If the penalty
       assessed usually would have been less than discharge, a waiver may be appropriate.
       6.54.1.2. Get a psychiatric evaluation if the offense involves moral turpitude as defined
       in Attachment 1. Place the report of the evaluation in the case file.
   6.54.2. Process promptly a waiver recommendation according to paragraph 6.55.
6.55. Processing Recommendations for Waiver:
   6.55.1. A commander who considers waiver of discharge appropriate sends a
   recommendation to the SPCM authority. The recommendation must include:
       6.55.1.1. Charges or accusations against the airman.
       6.55.1.2. Any available investigation report, military or civilian, of the offense.
       6.55.1.3. Actual sentence imposed, maximum punishment possible under the jurisdiction
       concerned, and status of any appeal made by the airman.
       6.55.1.4. If the court's action did not include sentencing, tell how the actions by the
       civilian authorities make the member subject to discharge under paragraph 5.51.
       6.55.1.5. Maximum punishment possible under the UCMJ.
       6.55.1.6. A copy of the judgment or order of the court.
       6.55.1.7. If there is a delay in obtaining such copy, forward the case without it. Send the
       copy to the SPCM authority when it is obtained. You may substitute a letter from the
       clerk of the court for the copy of the judgment, if this letter contains all the needed
       information. In oversea areas, you may use a copy of the military trial observer report
       cited below in lieu of a copy of the judgement or order of the court.
          6.55.1.7.1. A copy of the report of the military trial observer or other official United
          States observer assigned to attend the trial.
          6.55.1.7.2. Whether any fine was imposed by the court.
       6.55.1.8. If a fine was imposed, tell whether the airman has paid the fine or any part of it.
       6.55.1.9. If the fine has not been paid in full, give the approximate date the airman plans
       to pay it.
          6.55.1.9.1. Whether the airman is under military control or in civil confinement.
       6.55.1.10. If the airman is under military control, say whether there is any restraint such
       as probation or parole status imposed by the civil jurisdiction.
       6.55.1.11. If the airman is in civil confinement, state the earliest possible date that the
       airman will be eligible for release or for parole consideration.
       6.55.1.12. Whether the foreign jurisdiction objects to the airman's return to the
       continental United States (CONUS). If so, give the specific reason for the objection.
          6.55.1.12.1. A resume of the airman's military record as shown in Figure 6.5,
          paragraph 2.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                           125


           6.55.1.12.2. Any other relevant information. NOTE: Omit items required by these
           paragraphs if they do not apply.
           6.55.1.12.3. The SPCM authority may finally approve or disapprove the waiver.
       6.55.1.13. If it is approved, no further action in the case is required.
       6.55.1.14. If it is disapproved, discharge processing must start at once (Section 6A,
       paragraph 6.2).
6.56. Notice to Civil Authorities. While action in the case is pending, commanders must not
tell civil authorities that a member will be retained in the service. Neither should commanders
ask civil authorities to end or suspend any form of civil custody that may exist. If final action
results in a decision to retain the airman, the commander:
   6.56.1. Notifies civil authorities that the airman will be retained.
   6.56.2. Advises civil authorities that an airman who is in civil confinement will be returned
   to duty on release if:
       6.56.2.1. Any form of civil custody or restraint, such as parole or probation, will end; or
       6.56.2.2. Any form of civil custody or restraint, such as parole or probation, will be
       suspended for the rest of the member's service in the Air Force.
   6.56.3. Explains in the request for suspension or termination of civil custody or restraint that:
       6.56.3.1. Such custody or restraint is not compatible with the Air Force need for
       jurisdiction over a member.
       6.56.3.2. You must assign the airman where his or her services are needed without
       regard to a requirement to report in person to a probation officer at periodic intervals or to
       stay within the jurisdiction of the court.
       6.56.3.3. It is not practical for the Air Force to guarantee assignment at a particular base
       for a specified period of time.
       6.56.3.4. The civil authorities may consider permitting the airman to report, in writing
       rather than in person, when the terms of the probation or parole require reporting at
       certain intervals.
   6.56.4. Refers the case to HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2, if the problem cannot be resolved by:
       6.56.4.1. Termination or suspension of civil custody or restraint; or
       6.56.4.2. Modification of any requirement for reporting in person to a probation or parole
       officer or restrictions on departure from the jurisdiction of the court.
6.57. Civil Court Actions Under Appeal. Process a recommendation for discharge or waiver
of discharge even though the conviction is under appeal. It is, however, the general policy to
withhold execution of discharge, if approved, until the outcome of the appeal is known or the
time for appeal has passed. (Note: If only the sentence, and not the conviction, is being appealed
then discharge may be executed). If the appeal results in the conviction being set aside, the
airman may not be discharged due to civilian conviction.
   6.57.1. The respondent may request execution of the approved discharge while the appeal is
   pending. Make the request in writing and tell how separation would benefit the respondent. It
 126                                                                   AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


   must show that it was made with the advice and assistance of legal counsel. The separation
   authority asks the SJA to comment on the validity of the reasons given and to assess the
   possibility that the conviction will be overturned on appeal. The GCM authority acts on the
   request. Usually, approve the request if:
       6.57.1.1. There is an indication the respondent will benefit.
       6.57.1.2. The conviction is expected to withstand the appeal.
       6.57.1.3. No other circumstances exist requiring the return to military control of a
       member who is in civil confinement.
   6.57.2. A separation authority who believes that an approved discharge should be executed
   without waiting for the outcome of the appeal may ask for authority to do so. Route cases to
   HQ AFMPC/ DPMARS2 through the servicing MAJCOM/DP for comments and
   recommendations. If the respondent is a member of a tenant unit of another MAJCOM, the
   separation authority also sends the original and one copy of the case file to the parent
   MAJCOM/DP, who sends comments and recommendations to HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2. HQ
   AFMPC/ DPMARS2 refers the request for authority to discharge while an appeal is pending
   to AFPC for decision. The request must include:
       6.57.2.1. A complete review of the circumstances. State whether it is the conviction or
       the sentence that is under appeal.
       6.57.2.2. An indication whether or not the appeal is frivolous, or unlikely to result in
       reversal.
       6.57.2.3. An assessment by those in the best position to judge the validity of appeal.
       6.57.2.4. An explanation of any reason why the case should be treated as an exception
       prior to the completion of the appellate process.
       6.57.2.5. The estimated date action on the appeal will be finalized.
6.58. Execution of Discharge Based on Civil Conviction:
   6.58.1. An airman whose home of record is in the CONUS may be discharged in absentia if
   he or she:
       6.58.1.1. Is in civil confinement in the CONUS; or
       6.58.1.2. Has been released from confinement in the CONUS and is At home.
       Unlocatable since release. Absent without authority after having been returned to military
       control.
   6.58.2. An airman whose home of record is in the CONUS is not discharged while in civil
   confinement outside the CONUS. The discharge case may be processed; however, if
   discharge is approved, it may not be executed until the member has been released from
   confinement and returned to the CONUS.
   6.58.3. Airmen involved in civil court action outside the CONUS (for example, Alaska,
   Hawaii, or Puerto Rico) may be discharged in absentia if:
       6.58.3.1. The particular area is the member's home of record; and
       6.58.3.2. The member has requested discharge in that area.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                          127


   6.58.4. Do not discharge an airman in absentia if the GCM authority determines that return
   to military control for trial by court-martial is appropriate. In that case, the commander
   lodges a detainer with civil authorities to make sure the member returns to Air Force custody.
   The return of an airman to military control should not be requested unless serious charges are
   pending. In some cases the detainer may keep the airman from being considered for parole.
   Civil authorities may be reluctant to grant parole if the inmate will be subject to further
   confinement elsewhere. In this case, consider the type of military offense or offenses, the age
   of the airman, the military record, the airman's rehabilitation potential and the length of civil
   confinement.
   6.58.5. When an exception to any of the foregoing restrictions on discharge in absentia is
   considered appropriate, the case may be referred to HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2 for decision.
   The request for authority to discharge should include a complete explanation of the facts of
   the case. It must tell why they warrant an exception to policy.
   6.58.6. In some cases, the commander may decide to wait until the airman returns to the base
   before discharge is executed. This may happen when the time of confinement is short and the
   place of confinement is near the base of assignment. In other cases, where an airman was
   AWOL before the offense and the place of confinement is far from the base, the same
   consideration need not be given.
6.59. Cases Involving Foreign Courts.
   6.59.1. Do not discharge an airman while in a foreign penal institution. Withhold execution
   of an approved discharge until the airman is released from confinement and is returned to the
   CONUS. Only HQ AFMPC/ DPMARAS2 or higher authority may authorize exceptions.
   6.59.2. An airman confined in a foreign penal institution for a long term may be dropped
   from the unit rolls according to AFMAN 36-2125, Military Personnel Strength Accounting
   Methods (formerly AFR 35-40). This is an administrative action. It does not change the
   airman's status as a member of the Air Force. This status continues until discharge, if
   approved, is executed.
   6.59.3. You may retain an airman beyond ETS in some cases. When an airman who is
   present for duty is nearing ETS and is also awaiting action by foreign civil authorities,
   comply with paragraph 2.7.

Section 6K—Waiver Processing Requirements In Drug Abuse Cases.

6.60. Waiver of Discharge. An airman found subject to discharge for drug abuse under
paragraph 5.54 may warrant consideration for waiver of discharge. In deciding whether to
recommend a waiver, commanders must give full consideration to: The nature of the offense
involved, all the circumstances surrounding the offense, any matters in extenuation, the airman's
military record, the airman’s potential for future productive service, and an evaluation of the
retention criteria in paragraph 5.54.4.2.
   6.60.1. The commander must determine that the facts and circumstances of an airman's case
   meet the retention criteria in paragraph 5.54.2 and therefore warrant a recommendation for

6.61. Processing Recommendations for Waiver.
   6.61.1. A commander who initiates waiver of discharge action sends a recommendation to
   the SPCM authority. This provides the commander's reasons for recommending the waiver
   and must include:
       6.61.1.1. Evidence substantiating the airman's drug abuse - completed disciplinary or
       administrative action taken as a result of the airman's drug use (e.g. courts-martial orders,
       Article 15 actions, letters of reprimand).
       6.61.1.2. Any available investigation report, military or civilian, of the drug offenses.
       6.61.1.3. The commander’s statement explaining how the airman meets each of the
       seven retention criteria set forth in paragraph 5.54.4.2.
       6.61.1.4. Rehabilitative action taken in the airman's case and results.
       6.61.1.5. Any other relevant information.
   6.61.2. The SPCM authority may disapprove the waiver. If the SPCM authority recommends
   approval of the waiver action, it must be sent to the GCM authority for final action. If it is
   approved, no further action in the case is required. If it is disapproved, discharge processing
   must start at once (paragraph 6.2).

Section 6L—Waiver Processing Requirements in Sexual Assault Cases.

6.62. Waiver of Discharge. A member found subject to discharge for sexual assault or sexual
assault of a child under paragraph 5.55 may warrant consideration for waiver of discharge. In
deciding whether to recommend a waiver, commanders must give full consideration to: the
victim’s views on retention of the member, the nature of the offense involved, all the
circumstances surrounding the offense, any matters in extenuation, the member’s military record,
the member’s potential for future productive service, and an evaluation of the retention criteria in
paragraph 5.55.3.2.
   6.62.1. The commander must determine that the facts and circumstances of a member’s case
   meet the retention criteria in paragraph 5.55.3.2 and therefore warrant a recommendation for
   waiver action.
   6.62.2. Promptly process a waiver recommendation according to paragraph 6.63.
6.63. Processing Recommendations for Waiver.
   6.63.1. A commander who initiates waiver of discharge action sends a recommendation to
   the SPCM authority. This provides the commander’s reasons for recommending the waiver
   and must include:
       6.63.1.1. Evidence substantiating the member’s sexual assault or sexual assault of a
       child. This will typically be the completed disciplinary or administrative action taken as
       a result of the member’s sexual assault (e.g., courts-martial orders, Article 15 actions,
       letters of reprimand, etc.).
       6.63.1.2. Any available investigation report, military or civilian, of the sexual assault or
       sexual assault of a child offenses.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                          129


       6.63.1.3. The commander’s statement explaining how the member meets each of the
       retention criteria set forth in paragraph 5.55.3.2.
       6.63.1.4. Rehabilitative action taken in the member’s case, if any, and results.
       6.63.1.5. Any other relevant information.
   6.63.2. The SPCM authority may disapprove the waiver. If the SPCM authority
   recommends approval of the waiver action, it must be sent to the GCM authority for final
   action. If it is approved, no further action in the case is required. If it is disapproved,
   discharge processing must start at once (paragraph 6.2).

MEMORANDUM FOR (RESPONDENT GRADE, NAME, SSN) (date) (organization)
FROM: CC
SUBJECT: Notification Memorandum--Board Hearing

I am recommending your discharge from the United States Air Force for (cite the title of the
applicable part or parts of Chapter 5) according to AFPD 36-32, Military Retirements and
Separations, and AFI 36- 3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen, under the provisions of
(paragraph) (paragraphs) 5.XX. Copies of the documents to be forwarded to the separation
authority to support this recommendation are attached.

My reasons for this action are:

(Itemize the factual details of the actions that are the basis of the recommendation.)
This action could result in your separation with (see note 1). I am recommending that you
receive (see note 2) discharge. The commander exercising special court-martial jurisdiction or a
higher authority will make the final decision in this matter. If you are discharged, you will be
ineligible for reenlistment in the Air Force and will probably be denied enlistment in any
component of the armed forces. (See note 9)

You have the right to:
a. Consult legal counsel.
b. Present your case to an administrative discharge board (see note 3).
c. Be represented by legal counsel at a board hearing.
d. Submit statements in your own behalf in addition to, or in lieu of, the board hearing.
e. Waive the above rights. You must consult legal counsel before making a decision to waive any
of your rights.
f. If you have made an unrestricted report of sexual assault within the last 12 months and believe
this recommendation for discharge was initiated in retaliation for making that report, you have
the right to request review of this recommendation by the commander exercising General Court-
Martial (GCM) authority or first general officer in your chain of command if the GCM authority
is not a general officer, whichever is higher. If you request this review, the commander
exercising GCM authority or higher authority will review the circumstances of, and grounds for,
this recommendation for discharge and decide whether you will be discharged or retained in the
Air Force.

You have been scheduled for a medical examination. You must report to (medical facility), at
(time) on (date).

Military legal counsel (grade, name, duty address, and duty phone number) has been obtained to
assist you. An appointment has been scheduled for you to consult (him) (her) on (date, time,
place). Instead of the appointed counsel, you may have another, if the lawyer you request is in
the active military service and is reasonably available as determined according to AFI 51-201,
Administration of Military Justice. In addition to military counsel, you have the right to employ
 138                                                                  AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


civilian counsel. The Air Force does not pay expenses incident to the employment of civilian
counsel. Civilian counsel, if employed, must be readily available.

Confer with your counsel and reply, in writing, within 7 workdays, specifying the rights you
choose to exercise. The statement must be signed in the presence of your counsel who also will
sign it. If you waive your right to a hearing before an administrative discharge board, you may
submit written statements in your own behalf. I will send the statements to the discharge
authority with the case file to be considered with this recommendation. If you fail to respond,
your failure will constitute a waiver of the right to the board hearing. (See note 4.)

Any personal information you furnish in rebuttal is covered by the Privacy Act of 1974. A copy
of AFI 36-3208 is available for your use (say where) (see note 5).

If you request a board and you fail to appear without good cause, your failure to appear
constitutes a waiver of your right to be present at the hearing.

If you received advanced educational assistance, special pay, or bonuses, and have not completed
the period of active duty you agreed to serve, you may be subject to recoupment.

Execute the attached acknowledgment and return it to me immediately.

                                            Chapter 7

                      PROBATION AND REHABILITATION (P&R)

Section 7A—The Probation and Rehabilitation Program.

7.1. Program Objectives. The Air Force program of P&R for airmen subject to administrative
discharge gives airmen an opportunity to stay in the Air Force and get help so they may be able
to serve until ETS.
   7.1.1. Members who complete the program and return to a productive capacity within the
   Air Force represent the retention of a trained resource that might otherwise have been lost.
   The program includes suspension of approved discharges for specific periods of P&R and
   lengthy service probation. Members who complete the program may enhance their chances
   for a productive military or civilian career.
7.2. Rehabilitation Procedures:
   7.2.1. Concept: It is based on the principle of conditional suspension of administrative
   discharge for cause in deserving cases. Under the program, execution of the approved
   discharge for cause is conditionally suspended. This gives the member a chance to show that
   he or she is able to meet Air Force standards.
   7.2.2. Premise. In the right circumstances an airman can change a pattern of behavior. This
   assumption is consistent with the principles applied in the retraining program for airmen
   sentenced to confinement by court-martial. Civilian authorities take similar action in the
   disposition of persons who have committed a variety of civil offenses.
   7.2.3. Do not require the member to state whether P&R, if offered, would be accepted.
   Consideration of P&R will be automatic and based on the member's potential for
   rehabilitation and further useful military service. It should not be contingent on an intention
   stated before the outcome of the case is known.
   7.2.4. A recommendation for discharge may not be contingent on approval of P&R.
   7.2.5. A contingent waiver of board entitlement may not be conditioned on an opportunity
   for P&R.
   7.2.6. Airmen are not eligible for P&R if the reason for discharge is:
       7.2.6.1. Failure to comply with preventive medicine counseling, paragraph 5.53.
       7.2.6.2. Fraudulent entry, paragraph 5.15
       7.2.6.3. Entry Level Performance or conduct, paragraph 5.22
       7.2.6.4. Sexual assault, paragraph 5.55.
       7.2.6.5. In the interest of national security, paragraph 5.57
       7.2.6.6. In lieu of trial by court-martial. (Chapter 4)
       7.2.6.7. Drug abuse, paragraph 5.54.
 156                                                                   AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


   7.2.7. If the reason for separation is not listed in paragraph 7.2.6, the separation authority
   may offer P&R in any case where there seems to be a reasonable expectation of
   rehabilitation. For information about required consideration of P&R, see paragraph 7.4.
   7.2.8. Probation according to this chapter is not a substitute for preprocessing treatment. It is
   not to be confused with treatment for drug or alcohol abuse according to AFI 36-2701
   (formerly AFR 30-2).
7.3. Criteria for Suspension of Discharge. Consistent with Department of Defense policy, the
Air Force provides for the rehabilitation and return to duty of airmen whose conduct or
performance warrants their discharge. Offer airmen the opportunity for P&R when it is
reasonably possible to do so, for example those airmen:
   7.3.1. Who have demonstrated a potential to serve satisfactorily;
   7.3.2. Who have the capacity to be rehabilitated for continued military service or for
   completion of the current enlistment.
   7.3.3. Whose retention on active duty in a probationary status is consistent with the
   maintenance of good order and discipline in the Air Force?
7.4. Documenting Consideration of P&R. If the reason for discharge is unsatisfactory
performance or misconduct, the case file must show that P&R was considered by the initiating
commander, the board members if a hearing is involved, and the separation authority. If the
initiating commander does not recommend P&R, the reason must be given. A separation
authority who disapproves a recommendation of P&R must state the reasons for the decision.

Section 7B—P&R Procedures.

7.5. Authority To Suspend Execution of Discharge. Rests with the commander who approves
the discharge. For information about cases involving airmen with 16 years or more service, see
Chapter 6, Section 6F.
7.6. Action by the Separation Authority. When P&R is appropriate, the separation authority:
   7.6.1. Directs suspending execution of the approved discharge contingent on the successful
   completion of rehabilitation.
   7.6.2. Sets a specific period of rehabilitation. This period may not be less than 6 months nor
   more than 12 months.
   7.6.3. Sends a copy of the case file to the MAJCOM of assignment if the airman is assigned
   to another MAJCOM.
   7.6.4. Usually lets the airman stay with the current unit of assignment for the probationary
   period.
       7.6.4.1. Reassignment to another local unit, or within the MAJCOM of assignment, may
       be authorized if the circumstances of the case warrant.
       7.6.4.2. Reassignment to a unit of another MAJCOM during the probationary period is
       not usually authorized.
       7.6.4.3. In rare circumstances, the servicing MAJCOM/DP may determine that the
       airman should not be retained in the oversea area for the period of the probation. In these
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                        157


      cases, the MAJCOM/ DP requests the reassignment by message (includes MINIMIZE) to
      HQ AFMPC/DPMRPP2/ DPMARS2. If the oversea MAJCOM of assignment is not the
      servicing MAJCOM, make the MAJCOM of assignment an information addressee on the
      message.
      7.6.4.4. On receipt of the reassignment instructions from HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2, the
      oversea MAJCOM furnishes the gaining MAJCOM a complete file on the case. It
      includes copies of the administrative discharge proceedings with supporting documents,
      the correspondence effecting suspension of the approved discharge, and all related
      documents.
   7.6.5. Sends a memorandum to the airman's servicing MPF and immediate commander. For
   format, use Figure 7.1 More information may be included where it may be needed.
7.7. Action by the Immediate Commander. On receipt of notice from the separation authority
that an airman is to be offered P&R, the commander:
   7.7.1. Gives the airman a letter with information about the program. For fact sheet format,
   use Figure 7.2.
   7.7.2. Counsels the airman, emphasizing these points:
      7.7.2.1. The importance of an honorable discharge and how it helps the person who earns
      one.
      7.7.2.2. The possibility of difficulty in civilian life, if the approved discharge for cause
      were executed as it stands.
      7.7.2.3. The very remote chance that the type of discharge, once executed, would be
      changed. (For more information, see AFIs 36-3201, Air Force Discharge Review Board
      (formerly AFR 20-10) and 36-2604, Service Dates and Dates of Rank (formerly AFR 31-
      3).
      7.7.2.4. The offer of P&R does not excuse the airman's conduct.
      7.7.2.5. The airman can prevent execution of the approved discharge only by good
      conduct and duty performance.
      7.7.2.6. The commander will be the main judge of the airman's performance and conduct
      during the period of the P&R.
      7.7.2.7. The offer of P&R is not an attempt to keep the member in the Air Force
      involuntarily.
   7.7.3. Finds out whether the airman has enough retainability to complete the prescribed
   period of P&R. If necessary, gets the airman's voluntary request for extension of enlistment
   for the minimum time required.
   7.7.4. Determines whether the airman, if serving overseas, has enough time before date
   eligible for return from overseas (DEROS) to complete the P&R. If not, the airman must ask
   for an extension of the oversea tour or give up the P&R privilege. For more information, see
   AFI 36-2110 (formerly AFR 39-11).
   7.7.5. Requires the airman who accepts the offer of P&R to sign a statement of
   understanding and acceptance of the terms of the probation. These terms are set out in the
 158                                                                 AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


   letter from the separation authority and the fact sheet. The commander will countersign this
   statement.
   7.7.6. Requires the airman who does not accept the offer of P&R (or fails to satisfy the
   retention requirements) to sign a statement acknowledging an understanding of the
   rehabilitation privilege. The statement gives the date of the counseling by the commander. It
   also acknowledges understanding of the effects of the member's refusal to accept the
   opportunity for P&R. The statement and the letter from the separation authority (Figure 7.1)
   are returned to the separation authority. Then execute the approved discharge.
7.8. Airmen Undergoing Rehabilitation. During the prescribed probationary period or any
extensions of it, the procedures listed below apply:
   7.8.1. Afford airmen the opportunity to show they are:
       7.8.1.1. Capable of good conduct for a reasonable period of time and in varying
       conditions; and
       7.8.1.2. Able to perform their assigned duties well.
   7.8.2. Unit commanders are not required to set up a special rehabilitation program in the
   unit. Airmen on probation are given duties and on-the-job training appropriate to their grade,
   skill level, and experience.
   7.8.3. Airmen in P&R are not given special treatment, but their commanders and supervisors
   should recognize the factors responsible for their situation. Help from agencies or personnel
   reasonably available at the base should be sought when it is needed. You may ask personnel
   trained in rehabilitation techniques to help.
   7.8.4. The commander is the primary judge of the airman's performance. The rater prepares
   an EPR for each 90-day period. For more information, see AFI 36-2403 (formerly AFR 39-
   62).
   7.8.5. Promotion consideration is according to AFI 36-2502, Promotion of Airmen (formerly
   AFR 39-29).
   7.8.6. Do not select airmen in P&R for formal training. If the airman is in formal training at
   the time probation is offered and accepted, the separation authority decides whether the
   member will stay in the course of instruction during the probationary period.
   7.8.7. Usually airmen in P&R should not be placed on, or continued on, a control roster
   according to AFI 36-2907, Air Force Unfavorable Information File Program (formerly AFR
   35-32). If the airman's name is on the control roster, consider removing it when the member
   enters P&R.
   7.8.8. Reenlistment consideration is according to AFI 36-2606 (formerly AFR 35-16,
   volume 1).
   7.8.9. The status of airmen in P&R is not the same as that of a member placed under
   restriction or correctional custody according to Article 15, UCMJ. Neither is it the same as
   that of an airman undergoing rehabilitation training following a conviction by court-martial.
   Do not regard it as such.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                      159


7.9. Completion of Rehabilitation. When an airman completes a term of probation
successfully:
   7.9.1. The approved administrative discharge for cause is automatically and permanently
   canceled on the date the suspension expires.
   7.9.2. Future failure of the airman to maintain desired standards may be the basis of new
   discharge proceedings. NOTE: Basis of previous discharge may not be part of the basis of
   the new discharge proceeding.
   7.9.3. Eligibility for reenlistment will be according to AFI 36-2606 (formerly AFR 35-16,
   volume 1). None of the reasons for recommending discharge that existed before the date on
   which the P&R began may be the sole basis for denial of reenlistment.
   7.9.4. After the successful completion of P&R, characterize the ETS as honorable.
7.10. Other Options During Rehabilitation. As a rule, a member placed on P&R must serve
the full probationary period set by the separation authority. When P&R is completed
successfully, cancel the suspended discharge. Members who fail to meet the terms of the P&R
are usually discharged by execution of the suspended separation. However, there may be cases
where the probationary period should be changed. In such cases, the commander may send a
recommendation to the separation authority. It tells how and why the probationary period should
be changed. The separation authority under whom the member is serving when the
recommendation is made approves or disapproves the change. The commander may ask for:
   7.10.1. Cancellation of the Probation. This is done when the member's good conduct
   shows clearly that the goals of the P&R have been met. The separation authority may direct
   that:
       7.10.1.1. The probation be ended.
       7.10.1.2. Part of the remaining period be canceled; or
       7.10.1.3. Probation be continued for the entire time originally approved.
   7.10.2. Extension of the Probationary Period. This is done when the airman has made
   progress, but the commander is not sure that rehabilitation is complete. The airman's consent
   is required when the period is extended. The original probationary period and the proposed
   extension together must not exceed 1 year. The request must reach the separation authority in
   time for a decision to be made before the original probationary period ends. The separation
   authority may:
       7.10.2.1. Approve the requested extension.
       7.10.2.2. Disapprove the request and notify the member according to paragraph 7.12
       that discharge is to be executed.
       7.10.2.3. Direct that the probation continue until the date originally set.
   7.10.3. Discharge under Other Conditions. In some cases, a member who is making good
   progress in rehabilitation may ask for separation for a reason unrelated to the reason
   discharge for cause was approved. For example, a hardship may occur. The member's
   conduct during the period of P&R may have, to some extent, offset the conditions that led to
   the approved discharge for cause. The separation authority may:
 160                                                                 AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


       7.10.3.1. Approve the member's request, in which case the original discharge is set aside.
       7.10.3.2. Direct discharge for the reason originally approved, but with a more favorable
       type of discharge.
       7.10.3.3. Direct discharge as originally approved.
       7.10.3.4. Disapprove the member's request for voluntary separation.
7.11. Failure to Meet Goals of Rehabilitation. Good conduct and satisfactory duty
performance are required of airmen on P&R. Behavior similar to that for which discharge was
approved or other evidence of failure to meet Air Force standards shows the goals of the P&R
are not being met. In such a case, a commander may take more action against the airman.
   7.11.1. The commander may start new administrative or punitive action. It is not necessary
   to begin action to vacate the suspension of the approved discharge at the same time other
   action starts. The UCMJ will govern punitive action. Take administrative action according to
   the applicable part of this directive. This may involve a less favorable characterization of
   service.
   7.11.2. Suspension of the approved discharge may be vacated and the discharge executed as
   originally approved. For procedures, see paragraph 7.12.
   7.11.3. Action to vacate a suspension does not bar trial by court-martial.
   7.11.4. If action to vacate the suspension has been initiated before the probation ends, a
   suspended discharge is not automatically canceled. Action to vacate the suspension has been
   initiated when the notification memorandum required by paragraph 7.12 is delivered to the
   airman.
7.12. Vacating the Suspension of Discharge:
   7.12.1. The commander notifies the airman by memorandum of the proposal to vacate the
   suspension and execute an approved discharge. The memorandum gives:
       7.12.1.1. The reason or reasons for the action.
       7.12.1.2. The name, address, and telephone number of the military legal counsel named
       to help the airman.
       7.12.1.3. Advise that civilian legal counsel may be employed at the member's own
       expense.
       7.12.1.4. Instructions for replying within 7 workdays with a rebuttal or a waiver of the
       right to rebut. 7.12.2. The commander sends the case file through the MPF to the
       separation authority when the airman's reply is received. The case file will contain:
       7.12.2.1. A copy of the correspondence suspending the approved discharge and setting
       out the terms of the probation.
       7.12.2.2. A copy of the memorandum notifying the airman of the proposed vacation of
       the suspension.
       7.12.2.3. The airman's rebuttal or waiver of the right to rebut. A full statement of the
       actions the commander took to help rehabilitate the airman.
   7.12.3. The separation authority may:
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                      161


       7.12.3.1. Approve the recommendation and direct execution of the discharge with the
       type of discharge originally authorized or a more favorable one. EXCEPTION: If the
       airman has at least 16 years' service, referral to HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2 is required upon
       request of the member. For instructions, see Chapter 6, Section 6F.
       7.12.3.2. Disapprove the recommendation and direct that the P&R period be continued.
7.13. Unauthorized Absence During P&R. When an airman on probation has been AWOL for
15 days or more, the suspension may be vacated and the approved discharge executed. The
procedures in paragraphs 7.12.2 and 7.12.3 apply, except that the case file will not contain the
letter notifying the airman.
   7.13.1. An absentee whose whereabouts are unknown is not discharged under this procedure
   when other disposition would be more appropriate. For example, a member who should be
   returned to military control for trial by court-martial should not be discharged in absentia.
   When the GCM authority approves the discharge in absentia, the general procedures of
   paragraph 1.12 apply. EXCEPTION: If vacation of the suspension is approved for a
   member AWOL from an oversea unit, execution of the discharge must be delayed until the
   member is returned to CONUS.
7.14. Dual Status Airmen. When an airman who holds an appointment as a Reserve of the Air
Force commissioned officer accepts P&R, review the case to determine whether the member
should keep the Reserve appointment. Send the original and one copy of administrative
discharge board proceedings and copies of the letters offering and accepting P&R to HQ
ARPC/DP, Denver CO 80280-5000. The fact that the approved discharge has been suspended for
P&R will not, necessarily, influence the action on the member's Reserve status.

FACT SHEET FOR AIRMEN UNDERGOING PROBATION AND REHABILITATION


1. During probation and rehabilitation (P&R) your discharge will be suspended. During the
P&R period, you will be given every chance to show that you are capable of good conduct,
that you can perform your assigned duties well, and that you can adhere to Air Force
Standards.


2. If you complete the period of P&R successfully, at the end of your current enlistment:
    a. Your eligibility for reenlistment will be determined by the existing criteria for
reenlistment. The conditions that existed before the date you entered P&R will not be used
as the sole basis to deny you reenlistment.
   b. If you separate, you will receive an honorable discharge certificate.


3. The offer of P&R in no way excuses your behavior. P&R carries with it the discharge as
recommended and approved. You can, however, prevent this discharge by future good
conduct and duty performance. If you fail to maintain the high standards set for Air Force
personnel, one or more of these actions may be taken against you:
a. Cancellation of the suspension and execution of the approved discharge.
b. Initiation of new administrative discharge action.
c. Punitive action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.


4. If the action in paragraph 3b or c is taken, the result may be less favorable than the one
already approved and suspended.


5. This offer of P&R is not an attempt to keep you in the Air Force against your will. It is,
rather, a final effort to help you.

                                            Chapter 8

                        ADMINISTRATIVE DISCHARGE BOARDS

8.1. Purpose, Function, and Duties. An administrative discharge board is a fact finding and
recommending board. The functions and duties of a board appointed to consider an
administrative discharge case are purely administrative, not judicial. The board's first duty is to
develop and review all the information about the matter under consideration. It must reach clear,
logical findings of fact as to each allegation set out in the notification memorandum. It does not
make a finding concerning the member's medical qualification for worldwide duty. On the basis
of its findings, the board recommends one or more actions to be taken in the case. If the board
recommends discharge, it also makes separate recommendations as to:
   8.1.1. The type of separation.
   8.1.2. Whether the respondent should be offered an opportunity for probation and
   rehabilitation.
   8.1.3. DELETED.
8.2. Convening Authority. The SPCM authority convenes the board. The order of appointment
states that the board is appointed by authority of the Secretary of the Air Force. It also contains
the following paragraph:
   8.2.1. All commissioned and noncommissioned officers appointed will read and become
   familiar with the applicable parts of AFI 51-602, Boards of Officers (formerly AFR 11-31)
   and this instruction before acting as members of the board.
8.3. Composition of the Board. The convening authority must make sure the opportunity to
serve is given women and minorities. The mere appointment of, or the failure to appoint, a
woman or a member of a minority group to serve on a board is not a basis for challenging the
proceedings of the board.
   8.3.1. Voting Members. There must be at least three voting members according to the
   standards found in the UCMJ Article 25D (2). They must be experienced, unbiased persons
   of mature judgment. They must fully understand this regulation and the policies pertaining to
   the case. Usually, all board members will be commissioned officers. On the written request
   of the respondent, non-commissioned officers may serve as board members.
       8.3.1.1. The majority of the members must be commissioned officers. At least one must
       be a field grade officer. For the basic qualifications of board members for cases involving
       Regular and Reserve airmen, use Table 8.1.
       8.3.1.2. The quality of a board proceeding depends, to a great extent, on the knowledge
       and judgment of the board members. The officer making the commander's
       recommendation may not serve as a board member. No other officer or NCO having
       direct knowledge of the case may serve on the board.
   8.3.2. Nonvoting Members:
       8.3.2.1. The recorder assists the board and presents the government's case. The recorder
       must be a designated judge advocate, or, with the approval of the local staff judge
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                          165


       advocate, an officer of the Judge Advocate General's Department Reserve or another
       officer assigned full time legal duties in the Judge Advocate General's Department.
       8.3.2.2. The legal advisor, a judge advocate, presides in all open sessions. The
       responsibilities of the position make it necessary to select the best qualified (usually, the
       best trained and the most experienced) officer available.
   8.3.3. Challenges. The respondent and the recorder may challenge a voting member or the
   legal advisor for cause only. The legal advisor shall rule on all challenges except challenges
   to the legal advisor. The board will hear evidence on the challenge to the legal advisor and
   then, in closed session, the president of the board shall announce his ruling on the challenge.
   The president shall then poll the other voting members to see if they object to the president's
   ruling, and unless a majority of the voting members object, the president's ruling shall be
   final. The president shall announce the ruling on the challenge to the legal advisor in open
   session.
8.4. Reporter and Interpreter:
   8.4.1. A competent reporter or stenographer records the proceedings. For more information,
   see paragraph 8.17.
   8.4.2. An interpreter, if needed, translates the proceedings so the respondent can understand
   and take part in the proceedings.
8.5. Replacing Board Members. If, during a hearing, the board is reduced below a quorum of
three voting members, or there is no longer a majority of commissioned officers, the board is
recessed. A new voting member or members must be appointed. The respondent is given an
opportunity to challenge the newly appointed member or members for cause. After a new
member reads the verbatim transcript to that point, the hearing proceeds.
8.6. Functions of the Legal Advisor:
   8.6.1. Consults, as necessary, with the recorder and the respondent's counsel at any time
   prior to or after the convening of the board to:
       8.6.1.1. Prepare for the hearing.
       8.6.1.2. Clarify the issues.
       8.6.1.3. Rule on admissibility of evidence and other issues not requiring the presence of
       the voting members. Record and transcribe these sessions as part of the record of the
       action.
   8.6.2. Instructs the board on its functions, duties, and procedures in open session only.
   8.6.3. Advises the board at any and all stages of the proceedings, as appropriate, on request
   of the board, or on the legal advisor's own initiative.
   8.6.4. Rules finally on the admissibility of evidence and procedural matters.
   8.6.5. Authenticates the record of the board proceedings.
8.7. Duties of the Recorder:
   8.7.1. Assists the president of the board and the legal advisor as required.
 166                                                                 AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


   8.7.2. Reviews the case file as soon as it is received and prepares for the hearing. If more
   investigation, documentation, or information is needed for proper evaluation of the case, the
   recorder asks for it at this time.
   8.7.3. Arranges for the respondent and counsel for the respondent to review all the
   documents to be submitted in evidence.
   8.7.4. Provides the respondent and counsel the names, addresses, and statements of all
   witnesses.
   8.7.5. Interviews prospective witnesses and ensures their presence at the hearing.
   8.7.6. Takes affidavits from those who will not be available for the hearing. For more
   information about witnesses, see paragraph 8.10.
   8.7.7. Gives the respondent and counsel for the respondent timely notice of the time and
   place of the hearing. Includes in the notice that respondent's failure to appear without good
   cause at the hearing constitutes a waiver of respondent's right to be present at the hearing.
8.8. Review Before the Board Convenes. Voting members of the board do not review the case
before the hearing. The recorder and the legal advisor become familiar with all aspects of it.
8.9. Respondent's Rights. They have the right to:
   8.9.1. Personal Appearance or Representation. The respondent may appear in person,
   with or without counsel, at all open proceedings of the board.
       8.9.1.1. A respondent who cannot be present, or one who waives presence, must be
       represented by counsel.
       8.9.1.2. Counsel may be the Area Defense Counsel assigned to the installation or may be
       the counsel requested by the respondent, if the person requested is a member of the Air
       Force and is reasonably available as determined according to AFI 51-201 (formerly AFR
       111-1).
       8.9.1.3. Civilian counsel may be employed at the respondent's own expense.
       8.9.1.4. The respondent may be represented by either the designated or the requested
       military counsel, but not by both.
       8.9.1.5. Non-lawyer counsel may not represent a respondent before a board unless: the
       respondent expressly declines appointment of counsel qualified under Article 27(b)(1) of
       the UCMJ and requests specific non-lawyer counsel; or the separation authority assigns
       the non-lawyer counsel as assistant counsel.
   8.9.2. Challenge Board Members. The respondent and the recorder may challenge a voting
   member or the legal advisor for cause only.
   8.9.3. Presentation of Witnesses. A respondent may arrange for the presence at the hearing
   of any witness who agrees to testify without cost to the government. For information about
   how to arrange for other witnesses, see paragraph 8.10. The respondent or counsel may
   question any witness who appears before the board.
   8.9.4. Examination by the Board. All the rights granted by Article 31, UCMJ, are
   extended to the respondent. The respondent may testify under oath or submit an oral or
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                         167


   written unsworn statement personally or through counsel. A respondent may not be cross
   examined on an unsworn statement.
   8.9.5. Submission of Evidence. The respondent may, at any time before the board
   convenes, or during the proceedings, submit material for the board to consider. It may consist
   of sworn or unsworn statements, affidavits, certificates, or stipulations. This includes, but is
   not limited to, depositions of witnesses not deemed reasonably available, or unwilling to
   appear voluntarily.
8.10. Arranging for Witnesses. The recorder acts for the board to invite witnesses both for the
government and for the respondent. The legal advisor decides who to invite. The requesting party
must show that the desired witness' testimony can contribute materially to the case.
   8.10.1. Request for Personal Appearance. The request must contain:
       8.10.1.1. A brief summary of the testimony expected of the witness.
       8.10.1.2. An explanation of the relevance of such testimony to the issues of separation or
       characterization.
       8.10.1.3. An explanation as to why written or recorded testimony would not be sufficient
       to provide for a fair determination.
   8.10.2. Basis for Authorization. The legal advisor, on behalf of the convening authority
   may approve production of the witness if the legal advisor finds that:
       8.10.2.1. The testimony of the witness is not cumulative;
       8.10.2.2. The personal appearance of the witness is essential to a fair determination on
       the issues of separation or characterization;
       8.10.2.3. Written or recorded testimony will not accomplish adequately the same
       objective;
       8.10.2.4. The need for live testimony is substantial, material, and necessary for a proper
       disposition of the case; and
       8.10.2.5. The significance of the personal appearance of the witness, when balanced
       against the practical difficulties of producing the witness, favors the production of the
       witness. Factors to be considered in this decision include, but are not limited to the:
           8.10.2.5.1. Cost of producing the witness.
           8.10.2.5.2. Timing of the request for the witness.
           8.10.2.5.3. Potential delay in the proceeding that may be caused by producing the
           witness.
           8.10.2.5.4. Likelihood of significant interference with operational deployment,
           mission accomplishment, or essential training.
   8.10.3. Civilians and Members of the Armed Forces Not in the Active Military
   Service. Invitational travel orders are authorized for persons who are neither employees of
   the federal government nor members of the armed forces in the active military service. For
   more information about the travel of witnesses, see Joint Travel Regulation (JTR), volume 2.
 168                                                                 AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


   When invitational travel orders are authorized, the recorder sends a letter inviting the
   prospective witness to appear before the board.
   8.10.4. Civilian Employees of the Air Force and Members of the Air Force in the Active
   Military Service. If the board will meet at a place other than the prospective witness' duty
   station, the recorder will ask the major command (MAJCOM) concerned to make the military
   member or the civilian employee available. The MAJCOM may deny the request if military
   requirements do not permit the member or employee to appear before the board as a witness.
       8.10.4.1. The travel of witnesses will be according to the provisions of JTR, volumes 1
       and 2. AFI 65-601, volume 1, US Air Force Budget Policies and Procedures (formerly
       AFR 172-1, volume 1), governs the funding of the travel.
          8.10.4.1.1. If the board is held at the witness' duty station, availability will be
          presumed.
   8.10.5. Civilian Employees of Other Federal Agencies and Members of Other Armed
   Forces in the Active Military Service. The recorder will determine the availability of the
   prospective witnesses.
   8.10.6. Rescheduling the Board Hearing. Continue or postpone the hearing.
       8.10.6.1. Permit the attendance of a witness if the legal advisor finds the personal
       testimony of the witness is essential.
       8.10.6.2. Provide the respondent with a reasonable opportunity to obtain a written
       statement from a witness if:
          8.10.6.2.1. The legal advisor determines that the personal testimony of the witness is
          not required;
          8.10.6.2.2. The commander of a military witness determines that military duties
          preclude the witness' attendance at the hearing; or
          8.10.6.2.3. A civilian witness declines to attend the hearing. A federal employee may
          not decline to appear as a witness if directed to do so.
8.11. Dual Status Airmen. If the respondent is a dual status airman:
   8.11.1. Refer to Table 8.1 for special board membership requirement.
   8.11.2. The legal advisor's explanation of the board's purpose must include advice that the
   proceeding is also directed toward arriving at a recommendation as to whether the member's
   status as an officer of the USAFR should be terminated or retained. For more information see
   Chapter 6, Section 6G.
   8.11.3. The record of the proceedings must show the airman was so advised.
8.12. Hearing Procedures. The president of the board is the ranking member and presides
when the board meets in closed session. Only the voting members are present during this time.
   8.12.1. Oaths. The recorder administers the oaths to the legal advisor, the reporter, the
   interpreter (if one is used), and the board's voting members. The legal advisor administers the
   oath to the recorder. Reporters who have been administered one time oaths for courts-martial
   need not be resworn.
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                          169


   8.12.2. Instructing the Board. The legal advisor instructs the board in open session in the
   presence of the respondent and respondent's counsel. When the respondent is not present for
   the hearing, give the instructions in the presence of the respondent's counsel. Give the
   introductory instructions before the taking of the evidence starts. They must include an
   explanation of the board member's responsibilities, the recorder's, and the legal advisor's
   responsibilities.
       8.12.2.1. Give the closing instructions before the board goes into closed session to arrive
       at findings and recommendations. The instructions summarize the requirements for
       establishing a basis for the proposed discharge and lists the options available to the board.
       The legal advisor gives the instructions to fit the case at hand.
   8.12.3. Closing Arguments. The respondent or counsel for the respondent and the recorder
   may present arguments before the board goes into closed session.
8.13. Presenting Evidence to the Board. Strict rules of evidence need not be observed;
however, the legal advisor may impose reasonable restrictions of relevancy, competency, and
materiality of matters considered. New or additional evidence may be developed at the hearing.
The board may, on its own or the recorder's motion, amend or supplement the notification letter
to conform to the new evidence. In considering the new or additional evidence, the board is
bound by the same rules of evidence and procedure generally applicable in the hearing.
8.14. Burden of Proof. This is on the government to establish each allegation in the original
and amended notification memorandums by a preponderance of the evidence. A preponderance
of the evidence means simply the greater weight of credible evidence. There is no requirement to
prove any allegation beyond a reasonable doubt. Boards may not enter findings contrary to
matters previously adjudicated in courts-martial and civilian court convictions; however, this
does not preclude the respondent from presenting matters in mitigation, extenuation, and
explanation.
   8.14.1. Without limiting the respondent's right to a full and fair hearing, the legal advisor
   may impose reasonable restrictions on evidence introduced by the respondent that conflicts
   with previously adjudicated matters.
8.15. Voting in Closed Session. After considering and evaluating all the evidence, the board
arrives at findings and recommendations through secret, written ballot. A majority vote
determines each issue. Tie votes result in findings or recommendations favorable to the
respondent. They are announced as majority votes. The board records the findings and
recommendations in writing. A minority report may be submitted.
8.16. Findings and Recommendations:
   8.16.1. The board makes a separate finding on each allegation set out in the original and
   amended notification memorandums.
       8.16.1.1. Each finding sets out dates, places, and events as specifically as possible.
       8.16.1.2. The findings must be written with great care to reflect accurately the board's
       evaluation of the evidence.
       8.16.1.3. They should be reviewed by the legal advisor in open session for administrative
       sufficiency prior to the announcement.
 170                                                                   AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


   8.16.2. The board is limited to making recommendations concerning separation or retention,
   type of separation, and suspension of discharge. The recommendations must be consistent
   with the findings.
   8.16.3. The president of the board announces the findings and recommendations to the
   respondent and counsel for the respondent before the board adjourns.
8.17. Recording the Board Proceedings:
   8.17.1. For a sample format for preparing the record of the board proceedings, see AFPAM
   36-3210, Procedural Guide for Enlisted Administrative Discharge Boards (formerly AFP 39-
   3). Board proceedings will generally be summarized but parts of the proceedings must be
   verbatim. For more information, use Table 8.2.
       8.17.1.1. Send the original of the record to the convening authority for action according
       to paragraph 6.18.
       8.17.1.2. MPF Personnel Relocation Element will retain three copies for other actions
       required.
       8.17.1.3. Give the respondent one copy of the record of the proceedings.
   8.17.2. The legal advisor authenticates the record of the proceedings. If, after the hearing,
   the legal advisor is not reasonably available, the president and the recorder authenticate the
   record. State the reason for the substitution on the authentication page.
   8.17.3. The reporter must retain all the notes of the hearing until all the action in the case is
   final.

                                     SEPARATION PAY

9.1. General Procedures. All the basic criteria below defining eligibility for separation pay
must be met before a member is eligible for payment.
   9.1.1. The member is on active duty (AD) and has completed at least 6 years, but fewer than
   20 years of active service; active service does not have to be continuous.
   9.1.2. The member must not separate at his/her own request. (However, after a member has
   been formally and officially denied reenlistment or continuation on active duty, the member
   may request an earlier separation from AD without loss of separation pay.) Consider as a
   separation at the member's own request, the following:
       9.1.2.1. A member who declines training for a new skill as a precondition to reenlistment
       or continuation on AD.
       9.1.2.2. A member who declines to test for promotion or declines the promotion and is
       subsequently separated under a high year of tenure program.
       9.1.2.3. A member who requests voluntary separation under any of the provisions in
       Chapter 2 or Chapter 3 of this directive, except when member has been denied
       reenlistment or continuation on AD.
       9.1.2.4. A member who declines to get the required retainability for permanent change of
       station.
   9.1.3. The member must not separate during the initial enlistment. Members who complete
   their initial enlistment of 4 or 6 years and who are involuntarily separated while on an
   extension of their enlistment and have more than 6 years of active service are eligible for
   separation pay.
   9.1.4. The member is not being dropped from Air Force rolls and is not eligible for
   retirement at time of separation.
   9.1.5. The member is not separated for "misconduct" or "unsatisfactory performance" as
   defined in Chapter 5, Section 5E and Section 5H.
   9.1.6. The member is not separated as a result of a court-martial sentence.
   9.1.7. The member is not separated with a service characterization of under other than
   honorable conditions.
   9.1.8. The member must agree in writing to serve in the Ready Reserve for at least 3 years
   following the separation from active duty. A member who qualifies for separation pay (see
   Figure 9.1), but is unqualified for the Ready Reserves still must agree in writing to serve in
   the Ready Reserve in order to receive separation pay (see paragraph 9.1.8 second bullet and
   Table 9.1).
       9.1.8.1. A member who enters into this written agreement and who is qualified to serve
       in the ready reserve will be released to the Air Force Reserve and his/her agreement
       mailed to ARPC/ XPX, Denver CO 80280-5000. The only members who, otherwise
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                        173


       qualify for ready reserve, will be accepted to enter into ready reserve are those who
       qualify for full separation pay or are separated for involuntary expiration of term of
       service. All other members will be discharged.
       9.1.8.2. If the member has a military service obligation that is not completed at the time
       the member is released from AD, the 3-year obligation will begin on the day after the day
       on which the member completes his/her obligation.
       9.1.8.3. A member who enters into this written agreement and is not qualified for
       continuation in the ready reserve will be discharged. A member need not be qualified for
       reserve duty to meet this condition of eligibility for separation pay.
9.2. Full Separation Pay (Nondisability). Members involuntarily separated from AD may be
entitled to full separation pay (computation described in paragraph 9.4) if they meet the criteria
in paragraph 9.1 and the following conditions:
   9.2.1. The member's characterization of service is "honorable" and the member fully
   qualified for retention, but is being involuntarily separated by denial of reenlistment or
   continuation on AD under one of the following specific conditions:
       9.2.1.1. Member is denied reenlistment under an Early Release/Date of Separation
       rollback program.
       9.2.1.2. Member is denied reenlistment under High Year of Tenure (HYT) policy. This
       applies only to the E-4 HYT program since members have 20 years or more of service in
       all other HYT programs.
       9.2.1.3. Member is being involuntarily separated under a reduction in force program.
9.3. Half Separation Pay (Nondisability). Members involuntarily separated from AD may be
entitled to half separation pay (computation described in paragraph 9.4), if they meet the
criteria in paragraph 9.1 and the following conditions:
   9.3.1. The member's characterization of service is "honorable" or "under honorable
   conditions (general)" and the member is being involuntarily separated through either the
   denial of reenlistment or denial of continuation on AD under one of the following specific
   conditions:
       9.3.1.1. Expiration of Service Obligation: Use expiration of term of service (ETS)
       separation program designators (SPD) with reenlistment codes 2, 3, or 4 with the
       following exceptions:
           9.3.1.1.1. Reenlistment codes 4F, 4G, and 4N may be waived to permit reenlistment
           or extension of enlistment. Do not authorize separation pay if the member did not
           request a waiver to reenlist or extend, or receive an approved waiver. Use the
           voluntary ETS SPD. Authorize separation pay if the member requested a waiver to
           reenlist or extend and the waiver was denied. Use the involuntary discharge ETS
           SPD.
           9.3.1.1.2. Reenlistment codes 2E, 2G, 2H, 2J, 2K, 2L, 4H, 4I, and 4J are authorized
           extensions of enlistment. If member does not request an extension, use voluntary ETS
           SPD; separation pay is not authorized. If the member requests an extension and is
 174                                                                 AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


           denied the extension then payment is authorized. Use the involuntary discharge ETS
           SPD.
           9.3.1.1.3. Reenlistment codes 3D, 3E, and 3J or assignment availability codes 08
           (declined training) and 09 (declined PCS) are not eligible for separation pay since the
           member took self-initiated action to cause the separation. Voluntary ETS SPD will be
           assigned in these circumstances.
       9.3.1.2. Involuntary Convenience of the Government Separations (see Chapter 5,
       Section 5B).
       9.3.1.3. Drug Abuse Treatment Failure (see paragraph 5.31).
       9.3.1.4. Alcohol Abuse Treatment Failure (see paragraph 5.32).
       9.3.1.5. DELETED.
       9.3.1.6. Discharge in Interest of National Security (see Chapter 5, Section 5I).
       9.3.1.7. (DELETED)
9.4. Computation of Active Service and Separation Pay. Separation pay for members
eligible for full payment will be computed at 10 percent of 12 times the amount of monthly basic
pay to which entitled at the time of separation from AD, times the number of years and fractions
of a year of active service when separated. Compute separation pay for members eligible for half
payment at one half times what the full payment would have been. Compute active service time
as follows:
   9.4.1. Qualifying years do not have to be continuous; however, the last phase of the
   qualifying term must end immediately before the separation from AD occurs.
   9.4.2. Compute fractions of years in the following manner: Count each full month of service
   that is in addition to the number of full years of active service as one-twelfth of a year.
   Disregard any remaining fractional part of a month.
   9.4.3. Count periods for which a service member previously has received separation pay,
   severance pay, or readjustment pay for eligibility purposes (to ensure the member meets the
   minimum required years of AD), but do not use them in the multiplier to determine the
   amount of separation pay for a subsequent separation.
   9.4.4. Count periods of active military service in a Regular or Reserve component. Include
   AD for training performed.
   9.4.5. Do not include periods of absence without leave, confinement time awaiting trial that
   results in conviction, confinement time while serving a court martial sentence, or time lost
   while not in the line of duty. Count time served to make good time lost.
   9.4.6. Do not include service as a cadet or midshipman while in a service academy or a
   Reserve officer training program.
9.5. Repayment of Separation Pay:
   9.5.1. Members who receive separation pay, based on service in the Armed Forces, and who
   subsequently qualify for retired pay will have deducted an amount equal to the total amount
   of separation pay. Recoup this amount from each payment of this retired pay until the total
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                      175


   amount deducted is equal to the total amount of separation pay. Recompute the monthly
   recoupment rate when gross retired pay is increased for cost of living adjustments. NOTE:
   Only the difference between the recoupment and gross retired pay is taxable.
   9.5.2. Members who receive separation pay based on active service, and become eligible for
   disability compensation administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs will have
   deducted from such disability compensation an amount equal to the total amount of
   separation pay received. However, such reduction will not apply to disability compensation
   in which the entitlement to that disability compensation is based on a later period of AD for
   which the separation pay was received.
9.6. Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) Determination:
   9.6.1. A member may be separated under an Air Force specific program established as a
   one-half or no payment level by SAF.
   9.6.2. Notwithstanding the provisions of this or any other directive, the SAF may direct, in
   extraordinary cases, because of the conditions under which a member is separated, that the
   member does not warrant separation pay. Use this discretionary authority sparingly and do
   not delegate it.
      9.6.2.1. Requests for SAF to deny separation pay to an otherwise qualified member will
      originate with the unit commander. The request will be in memorandum format and
      contain justification for denial of separation pay.
      9.6.2.2. Unit commanders requesting SAF action under this paragraph must notify the
      member of the request and justification for the request. The member will be given 3
      workdays to submit a rebuttal with the assistance of military legal counsel.
      9.6.2.3. The request and rebuttal will be reviewed by the SPCM's staff judge advocate
      and forwarded in original and one copy to HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2 with the concurrence
      of the SPCM and MAJCOM/DPA, for referral to the SAF (AFPC). Either the SPCM or
      MAJCOM/DPA may disapprove the request and return it to the unit commander.

 As a condition to receiving separation pay, I agree to serve in the Ready Reserve for a
 period of not less than three years following my separation from active duty. I understand if
 I have not completed my military service obligation (MSO) at the time of my separation
 from active duty, the three-year period I have agreed to serve in the Ready Reserve will
 begin on the date after the date I complete my MSO.


 I understand the Air Force is not under any obligation to offer me an enlistment in the
 Ready Reserve, and I understand that I may not necessarily be enlisted in the Ready
 Reserve.


 I understand that I will not be enlisted in the Ready Reserve if I am separated for reasons
 that make me ineligible for enlistment.


 I understand that if I later become eligible for retired or retainer pay under Title 10 or Title
 14, U.S.C., based on active duty service for which I receive separation pay, I will have an
 amount deducted from each payment of that retired or retainer pay until the amount
 deducted equals the total amount of separation pay. I understand that if I later become
 eligible (as a result of the service upon which my separation pay amount is based) for
 disability compensation administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA), the
 DVA will withhold such payment until the amount withheld equals the gross amount of
 separation pay.

                                         Chapter 10

       SRA (E-4) AND BELOW HIGH YEAR OF TENURE (HYT) SEPARATION
                              PROCEDURES

Section 10A—Policy and Procedures.

10.1. SrA (E-4) and below HYT Policy and Procedures. The program was developed to help
manage the force and correct the increasing seniority in the enlisted force structure. The HYT
policy was revised effective 4 January 2010, which changed the SrA (E-4) HYT from 12 years of
active service to 10 years of active service. The basic policy and procedures are:
   10.1.1. Every enlisted member is assigned an HYT date.
   10.1.2. The established HYT date for E-4 and below is the year and month an individual
   reaches 10 years total active federal military service (TAFMS).
   10.1.3. SrA (E-4) and below who fail to progress to SSgt (E-5) are separated upon reaching
   10 years of TAFMS.
   10.1.4. The Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) automatically projects these
   individuals for separation 180 days prior to their established date of separation (DOS).
   10.1.5. If the member’s established DOS is beyond the HYT month and year, for example, a
   member who is demoted and their DOS is later than the HYT month, the system will not
   automatically project these members for separation.
       10.1.5.1. One-hundred and eighty (180) days prior to their HYT month, the MPFs must
       manually project these airmen to separate.

Section 10B—SrA and Below Assigned to Base Closures or Unit Deactivations.

10.2. Assigned To An Overseas Closure Base or Unit Deactivation with 10 Years or More
of Active Service. The following adjustments to a member’s HYT date will be made for
individuals assigned to an overseas base or unit which is scheduled to close:
   10.2.1. For members with 10 years or more TAFMS, the HYT date will equal the new
   DEROS established on the individual provided that it does not affect promotion eligibility.
       10.2.1.1. If an individual is eligible for promotion and the new DEROS is established
       prior to the eligibility cutoff, the HYT date will be established 12 months beyond
       DEROS to allow member to PCS and still remain eligible for that promotion cycle.
          10.2.1.1.1. EXAMPLE: If the base is closing in June 2003 and the member’s current
          HYT date is November 2003, a new HYT date will be established as June 2004
          because based on member’s current HYT date, he or she is eligible for promotion in
          the current promotion cycle. If the HYT was to be established on the new DEROS
          month of June 2003, that person would lose a promotion opportunity.
10.3. Assigned To A CONUS or Overseas Closure Base or Unit Deactivation with Less
than 10 Years of Active Service. The following adjustments to a member’s HYT date will be
 180                                                                  AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


made for a member assigned to an overseas or CONUS base closure or unit deactivation who has
less than 10 years TAFMS:
   10.3.1. If member’s current HYT date renders them ineligible for promotion testing and they
   cannot obtain the required retainability for a PCS assignment, the member may be separated
   prior to the HYT date without forfeiture of separation pay (see paragraph 9.1.2).
       10.3.1.1. The member’s commander sends a request, in writing, to the base separation
       authority. The request asks the base separation authority for approval to separate the
       member early without loss of separation pay.
       10.3.1.2. The commander must also provide the date the member can no longer be
       effectively utilized.
       10.3.1.3. The base separation authority is the final approval authority.
   10.3.2. If the member’s current HYT date allows them another promotion opportunity, but
   does not provide them with enough retainability for a PCS assignment and the base is closing
   prior to the eligibility cutoff date, the member’s HYT date will be extended 12 months from
   date of base or unit closure. This extension provides retainability for a PCS assignment and
   the member does not lose the opportunity for a promotion consideration. Notify HQ
   AFPC/DPPRS by message, email or data fax of the specifics surrounding the case and ask us
   to extend the HYT.
   10.3.3. This paragraph pertains to those members identified in paragraphs 10.2.1.1 and
   10.3.2 whose promotion opportunities are exhausted.
       10.3.3.1. Once the promotion list is released and a member is not selected for promotion,
       they have the option to request early separation and still receive their HYT separation
       pay.
       10.3.3.2. The member makes the request on an AF Form 31, Airman’s Request for
       Early Separation/Separation Based on Change in Service Obligation, which goes
       through the unit commander, who endorses it to the base separation authority.
       10.3.3.3. The unit commander must give a recommendation as to the DOS.
       10.3.3.4. The base separation authority can approve the separation for the date requested,
       approve the separation for a later date due to needs of the Air Force, or disapprove the
       request.

Section 10C—Demotion Actions.

10.4. Demotion Actions: The following actions are taken when a member is demoted and
is affected by the HYT program.
   10.4.1. Members who are reduced to SrA or below and have 16 years of service (YOS) but
   less than 20 YOS are considered lengthy service qualified and their HYT date will be
   established at 20 YOS.
   10.4.2. A member reduced to SrA (E-4) after reaching 10 YOS will have their HYT date
   adjusted by HQ AFPC/DPSOE (Airman Promotion Management Section) to the fourth
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                    181


  month after the first SSgt promotion cycle for which they are time in grade (TIG) eligible
  (see AFI 36-2502, Airman Promotion Program, for TIG eligibility).
     10.4.2.1. A member is not required to be considered for promotion if they are ineligible
     for consideration according to AFI 36-2502, table 2.1.
     10.4.2.2. An HYT adjusted to provide one promotion opportunity will not be further
     reduced simply because the member has an ineligible promotion eligibility status (PES)
     code. The adjusted HYT will remain even though the PES code is projected to exist
     through the promotion eligibility cutoff date of the next cycle, or because the member is
     not expected to be recommended for promotion the next promotion cycle. There are no
     permanent PES codes that cannot be changed prior to promotion testing.
     10.4.2.3. If the member is made ineligible for consideration for promotion in the next
     promotion cycle, he or she will separate in the fourth month after the SSgt promotion
     cycle for which they are TIG eligible unless the member requests early separation (see
     paragraph 10.8). This includes members assigned to an overseas location.
  10.4.3. Member will separate on their adjusted HYT unless selected for promotion to SSgt
  prior to separation.
  10.4.4. Those members reduced to SrA or below before reaching 10 YOS will be allowed to
  remain in the Air Force until they reach 10 YOS, which is the normal HYT.
     10.4.4.1. Member who is reduced to SrA or below and has over 9 years, 8 months of
     service is given a maximum of 120 days after the demotion date before separation. This
     allows the member time for appeals, separation processing, terminal leave, and other
     actions.
         10.4.4.1.1. This may require the FSS to ask for a waiver to the HYT. For example, a
         member may have 9 years, 11 months and 2 days of service and would need 60 days
         or more to appeal an Article 15 action. Member would require an HYT extension.
         10.4.4.1.2. Member is not entitled to remain on active duty for one SSgt promotion
         cycle consideration unless they can qualify for promotion prior to reaching 10 YOS.
     10.4.4.2. Notify HQ AFPC/DPSOS by email, or data fax to update the adjusted HYT for
     those demoted on or before reaching 10 YOS.
  10.4.5. Members demoted to the grade to Airman First Class (E-3) or below and having 10
  YOS but less than 16 YOS, must be separated no later than 120 days after the effective date
  of the demotion or on DOS, whichever is earlier. If prior to being separated the member goes
  over 16 YOS, they are considered to be in a lengthy service category and are not separated
  under the HYT program. Their HYT is set at 20 YOS.
     10.4.5.1. Members whose current DOS will not allow them to remain on active duty up
     to 120 days after demotion date to allow for appeal processing, separation processing,
     terminal leave, etc., may extend their enlistment.
     10.4.5.2. If the member is not appealing the demotion and has no leave to use or is
     selling back leave, then the member should be separated within 30 days to allow for
     separation processing.
 182                                                                  AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


   10.4.6. Demoted SrA who are entitled to one SSgt promotion cycle and have their HYT
   adjusted according to paragraph 10.4.2 above and who subsequently go over 16 YOS, will
   also be considered to be in a lengthy service category and will not be separated under the
   HYT program. Their HYT will be set at 20 YOS.
   10.4.7. Members who are demoted to SrA or below and who are eligible for retirement (20
   YOS or more) must retire not later than the first day of the seventh month after the effective
   date of demotion. Reference AFI 36-3203, Service Retirements.

Section 10D—Members on Terminal Leave and Promoted

10.5. Members on Terminal Leave When Promotion List is Released. Members eligible for
promotion in the current promotion cycle who depart on terminal leave prior to release of the
promotion list must be briefed prior to departure about the following:
   10.5.1. The member’s squadron commander will contact member if he or she is selected for
   promotion to SSgt. Ensure member provides a telephone number and address where they
   may be reached.
   10.5.2. If member is selected for promotion, he or she must report back to their unit of
   assignment to accept the promotion. Once selected for promotion, their HYT separation is no
   longer valid.
   10.5.3. If member declines to return to his or her unit of assignment to accept the promotion,
   their separation will be considered a voluntary separation (not entitled to separation pay). Use
   Separation Program Designator (SPD) code KBK (see paragraph 10.11).

Section 10E—Members Not Entitled to Separation Pay (See Table 9.1.)

10.6. Member Not Entitled to Full Separation Pay. Member involuntarily separated from
active duty on their HYT date is only entitled 1/2 separation pay if any of the following
circumstances exist:
   10.6.1. The member is not eligible for promotion.
   10.6.2. The member is non-selected by the commander for retention.
   10.6.3. The member is not fully qualified for retention other than being denied continuation
   due to HYT.
10.7. Member Not Entitled to Separation Pay. In some instances, members take selfinitiated
actions to cause the separation. These members are not entitled to any separation pay. The
following examples are considered to be a separation at the member’s own request:
   10.7.1. Declines to test for promotion on the last promotion cycle for which they are eligible
   for promotion.
   10.7.2. Selected for promotion to SSgt and declines the promotion.
   10.7.3. Refused retainability for PCS, TDY, overseas assignment or tour (RE Code 3D,
   Assignment Availability Code 09).
   10.7.4. Refused retainability for PME, training or retraining (RE Code 3E or Assignment
   Availability Code 08).
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                           183


   10.7.5. Requests voluntary separation under any of the provisions in Chapter 2 or 3 of this
   AFI. NOTE: See paragraph 10.8 for instructions on separating early under HYT without
   loss of separation pay.

Section 10F—Separating Early Without Loss of Separation Pay.

10.8. Separating Early Under HYT Program Without Loss of Separation Pay. Members
who have exhausted all promotion opportunities can separate prior to their HYT month without
loss of separation pay (see paragraph 9.1.2).
   10.8.1. Once the promotion list to SSgt is released, those members not selected for
   promotion and who no longer have any promotion opportunities in future cycles may ask to
   separate anytime after the release date and still receive full separation pay.
   10.8.2. Example. A member is not on the SSgt promotion list that is released in August
   2003 and has an HYT date of July 2004. Since the member’s current HYT date will not allow
   him or her to test in the next promotion cycle, he or she can request to separate anytime after
   the promotion is released in August 2003.
   10.8.3. Procedures Used to Request An Earlier Date. The request to separate early must be
   on AF Form 31, Airman’s Request for Early Separation/Separation Based on Change in
   Service Obligation.
       10.8.3.1. The member states they have exhausted their promotion opportunities and want
       to separate early under the HYT program.
       10.8.3.2. The member states the separation effective date requested and the squadron
       commander makes a recommendation to the base separation authority that has final
       approval or disapproval authority.
       10.8.3.3. Brief the member that if they do separate earlier, it will result in a slightly less
       payment since the separation pay is calculated based on years and months of service.
   10.8.4. Member may separate on their normal DOS when the DOS is prior to the HYT
   month if the member no longer has any future promotion opportunities.
       10.8.4.1. Example: The SSgt list is released on 15 August 2003. SrA Jones decides she
       wants to separate on her normal DOS. Since SrA Jones no longer has any future
       promotion opportunities, she separates on her normal DOS provided the DOS is before
       the HYT month. SrA Jones is entitled to separation pay.

Section 10G—High Year of Tenure Extensions, Waivers and Separation Program Designator
(SPD) Codes.

10.9. Extending To HYT Month. Members whose current DOS is prior to their HYT month
can extend their enlistment to coincide with their HYT date if otherwise eligible. (See AFI 36-
2606, Reenlistment in the United States Air Force, table 4.1, rule 27.)
10.10. HYT Waiver Request. There are two types of HYT waivers, hardship and best interest
of the Air Force:
   10.10.1. Hardship Waivers. Members may submit requests for extension of an HYT date
   based on an extreme hardship not common to contemporaries.
 184                                                                   AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004


       10.10.1.1. The request is sent through the unit commander and base discharge authority
       to HQ AFPC/DPPRS for consideration on a case-by-case basis.
       10.10.1.2. Approval requires detailed evidence that the member must stay on active duty
       to resolve the hardship and can eliminate the problem within the extension period.
       10.10.1.3. The maximum extension period is 1 year.
       10.10.1.4. The base separation authority may disapprove requests not meeting these
       criteria.
       10.10.1.5. An approved HYT waiver does not automatically extend a person’s DOS. The
       member must request an extension in accordance with AFI 36-2606, table 4.1, rule 27, if
       otherwise eligible.
   10.10.2. Best Interest of the Air Force. Members initiate and submit requests for HYT
   extensions based on the best interest of the Air Force. Normally these requests are made
   when a uniquely qualified SrA (E-4) is filling a critical position and is essential to the success
   of a vital mission and a suitable replacement cannot be found.
       10.10.2.1. Although the member initiates the request, the wing or comparable level
       commander must support the request and show the member’s retention is essential to the
       success of the mission.
       10.10.2.2. Submit fully-justified request through command channels to HQ AFPC/
       DPPRS. The request must contain unit, wing, and MAJCOM recommendations and
       should be submitted no earlier than 1 year and no later than 6 months before the
       member’s HYT date.
       10.10.2.3. MAJCOMs may disapprove the request and send the request back to the
       originating base.
       10.10.2.4. The maximum extension period is 1 year.
       10.10.2.5. An approved HYT waiver does not automatically extend a person’s DOS. The
       member must request an extension in accordance with AFI 36-2606, table 4.1, rule 27, if
       otherwise eligible.
10.11. Separation Program Designator (SPD) Codes. The following SPD codes are used
under the HYT program:

10.12. Prescribed Forms.

AF Form 31, Airman’s Request for Early Separation Based on. Change in Service Obligation.

              WAR AND MOBILIZATION SEPARATION PROCEDURES

A2.1. When authorized by the United States President or Congress, the active force may be
expanded by the mobilization of the Reserve Forces to satisfy any emergency
required. Usually under these circumstances, it is necessary to minimize active duty losses.
This is achieved by suspending enlisted voluntary and involuntary discharges, releases, and
retirements.
A2.2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, during any period members of a
Reserve component are serving on active duty pursuant to an order to active duty under
authority of Title 10 U. S.C., Sections 672, 673, and 673b, the President may suspend any
provisions of law relating to promotion, retirement, or separation applicable to any member of
the armed forces who the President determines essential to the national security of the United
States.
 194                                                                    AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004

                      ADMINISTRATIVE DISCHARGE FACT SHEET

A3.1. Administrative Discharge. These are the types of administrative discharges from the Air
Force. A discharge is defined as a complete separation from all military status, duties,
obligations, and responsibilities that have been gained by enlistment in the Air Force. The type
of discharge a person receives could affect his or her ability to get a civilian job in the future. A
person may not be hired, simply because he or she did not have an honorable discharge. Airmen
should recognize that the type of discharge they receive is a serious matter and that if they
receive any discharge other than an honorable discharge, it may cause them difficulties. Also, as
a general rule, persons who entered the Air Force after 7 Sep 80 and are administratively
discharged from active duty before completing the shorter of 24 months of continuous active
duty, or the full period for which they were called or ordered to active duty, are not eligible for
any benefit administered by the Veterans Administration.
A3.2. Honorable Discharge. This type of discharge is separation from the Air Force with
honor. An honorable discharge means the person has served the Air Force well by meeting or
exceeding the required standards of duty performance and personal conduct. The honorable
discharge reflects to the world that the member has satisfactorily completed a commitment to
military service. All veterans’ benefits are given to an eligible person with an honorable
discharge.
A3.3. Under Honorable Conditions (General) Discharge. This is separation from the Air
Force with honor, but to a lesser degree than the honorable discharge. This discharge is given
when normally faithful service is marred by negative aspects of a person's duty performance or
personal conduct, but the negative aspects definitely outweigh the good. All veterans benefits are
given to an eligible person with an under honorable condition (general) discharge.
A3.4. Under Other Than Honorable Conditions Discharge. Separation from the Air Force
with the worst possible administrative discharge. A person receives an under other than
honorable conditions discharge when his or her personal conduct fall significantly below
acceptable military standards. This discharge may result from one or more acts, or failures to act,
which are considered to be an obvious departure from the high standards of conduct expected of
military members. This type of discharge may be given only after a person has had the
opportunity to request a hearing by an administrative discharge board. Usually, only acts, or
failures to act, which occur during the current enlistment may be used to separate a person with
this type of discharge. Significant veterans benefits are denied by the under other than honorable
conditions discharge.
A3.5. Entry-Level Separation. This type of separation is given only when the person is in his
or her first 180 days of continuous active military service or the first 180 days of continuous
active military service after a break of more than 92 days of active service. This is a discharge
that does not attempt to characterize the type of service as either good or bad. It is not the only
type of separation authorized during the first 180 days of military service, as it is possible for a
person to receive either an honorable or an under other than honorable conditions discharge as
well.
A3.6. Administrative Separations. Administrative separations may affect a person's ability to
reenlist in the Air Force. A person is not eligible to reenlist if he or she: A3.6.1. Has been
AFI36-3208 9 JULY 2004                                                                      195


separated from the Air Force with a general or under other than honorable conditions discharge;
A3.6.2. Has been involuntarily separated under AFI 36-3208. (If the reason for separation was
failure to meet minimum fitness standards, hardship or dependency reasons, or for minority, then
reenlistment is possible with a waiver.); A3.6.3. Is serving a period for probation and
rehabilitation under AFI 36-3208; or A3.6.4. Is under investigation for possible administrative
discharge or has been notified by the unit commander of AFI 36-3208 action.
