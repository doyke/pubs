This instruction implements AFPD 91-2, Safety Program and Lightning Protection Requirements
in AFMAN 91-201, Section H, by governing withdrawal of personnel from potential explosive
sites (PES’s) that do not have a properly maintained Lightning Protection System (LPS) before
the incidence of an electrical storm within 10-nautical miles. This instruction applies to all
personnel, government or contractor, operating in explosive areas required to have LPS on any
part of Eglin AFB, to include the Eglin Reservation and Duke Field. Refer recommended
changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)
using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from
the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of command. Ensure that all records created
as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air
Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision reflects changes made in office symbols and updated guidance in AFMAN 91-201,
Explosive Safety Standards, dated 17 November 2008. The 30-day grace period concerning the
repair of a deficient LPS has been deleted. This publication has been extensively revised and
must be completely reviewed.

Association (NFPA) 780, Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems; National
Electric Code, NFPA 70, reference (1), and MIL-HDBK-419.
2. Evacuation Policy.
     2.1. All explosive facilities/areas except licensed locations require lightning protection
     systems to be installed and properly maintained. When LPS is determined to be deficient,
     personnel will evacuate explosive facilities to an area outside public transportation route
     (PTR) distance IAW AFMAN 91-201 and determined by Air Armament Center Safety
     Office, Weapons Safety Division (AAC/SEW) when an electrical storm is in the vicinity. An
     electrical storm is considered “in the vicinity” if personal observation or official weather
     reports locate lightning flashes within 10 nautical miles (11.5 statute miles).
     2.2. Personnel will be evacuated from the following explosive locations:
        2.2.1. All storage locations (other than those locations that are licensed), operating
        buildings, open storage sites or loading docks without approved lightning protection
        systems, which contain explosives.
        2.2.2. Facilities containing exposed explosives, explosive dust or explosive vapor, or
        unpackaged electrically initiated explosive devices, even though equipped with approved
        lightning protection systems.
        2.2.3. Parked, explosives- laden vehicles not protected by an approved lightning
        protection system.
        2.2.4. All non-explosive locations within public traffic route (PTR) of facilities and
        carriers listed above.
3. Responsibilities.
     3.1. Responsible Commander(s) will:
        3.1.1. Ensure facilities requiring lightning protection is installed and properly
        maintained.
        3.1.2. Submit an AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineering Work Order, to 96 CES for
        repair of the lightning protection system.
        3.1.3. Monitor LPS repair status until repaired and certified by 96 CES.
        3.1.4. If personnel evacuations are required, prepare local OI for the evacuation of
        personnel; coordinate OI with AAC/SEW.
        3.1.5. Coordinate de-activation letter with AAC/SEW once LPS is repaired and certified.
     3.2. AAC/SEW will:
        3.2.1. Review status of lightning protection systems (LPS) throughout Eglin Main and
        the Eglin reservation to determine the need for personnel evacuations.
        3.2.2. Assist in prioritizing repair projects when LPS is found to be deficient.
        3.2.3. Prepare an activation memorandum signed by the Director of Safety (AAC/SE) to
        the Installation Commander (96 ABW/CC) activating evacuation of personnel to PTR
        distance due to deficient LPS.

      3.2.4. Prepare a de-activation memorandum (Attachment 2) when lightning protection
      systems meet standards.
   3.3. The Commander, 96th Air Base Wing (96 ABW/CC), Installation Commander, will:
      3.3.1. Sign activation memorandum (Attachment 1) upon notification from AAC/SE.
      3.3.2. Upon activation, direct the responsible commander to publish and implement
      evacuation procedures in an operating instruction (OI) to ensure the safety of personnel
      when lightning is determined to be within 10-nautical miles. Each commander will
      ensure that the OI is coordinated and approved by AAC/SEW.
      3.3.3. Ensure the Commander, 96th Civil Engineering Group (96 CEG/CC) conducts
      repair projects to ensure lightning protection systems meet standards, and coordinates
      repair priorities with AAC/SEW. The commander that is the custodian for affected
      facilities will champion the repair process.
      3.3.4. Sign the de-activation memorandum (Attachment 2) upon notification from
      AAC/SE stating the lightning protection system has been repaired and certified and
      evacuation of personnel within PTR of the affected facility is no longer required.

MEMORANDUM FOR 96 ABW/CC
FROM: AAC/SEW
SUBJECT: Activation of Evacuation Procedures in EAFBI 91-207, Lightning Protection
Deficiency Risk Acceptance and Evacuation of Eglin AFB Explosives Areas
1. AFMAN 91-201, paragraph 5.22 states: “Properly maintained lightning protection systems
(LPS) are required for all explosives facilities (to include open locations), except as noted in
paragraph 5.25. The DoD has selected the LPS criteria of NFPA 780, Standard for the
Installation of Lightning Protection Systems, including Annex K (Protection of Structures
Housing Explosive Materials), Annex D (Inspection and Maintenance of Lightning Protection
Systems), and Annex E (Ground Measurement Techniques) for AE facilities. Annex criteria shall
supersede main body criteria. If LPS test methods or designs other than prescribed in this section
are used, they shall offer equivalent protection to those prescribed in this section and be
approved via the explosives site plan.”
2. Describe the details of the facility operations, why the LPS is deficient, and why the LPS
cannot be immediately repaired.
3. A Public Transportation Route (PTR) evacuation arc will be determined. Personnel will be
evacuated to PTR distance as determined by AAC/SEW whenever lightning is determined to be
within 10-nautical miles of explosive area as described by AFMAN 91-201 and this instruction.
4. AAC/SE recommends that you activate the procedures contained in EAFBI 91-207 due to
deficient lightning protection until LPS is determined to be sufficient by 96 CES and AAC/SEW.
The evacuation of personnel will remain in effect until the LPS is repaired, certified IAW NFPA-
780 and AFI 32-1065, and a de-activation letter is issued.

The procedures outlined in EAFBI 91-207 are now activated. Personnel will evacuate to PTR
distance as determined by AAC/SE Director of Safety when lightning is declared to be within
10-nautical miles of Eglin Main. The evacuation procedures will remain in effect until LPS is
repaired and certified and you receive a de-activation memorandum.

MEMORANDUM FOR 96 ABW/CC
FROM: AAC/SE
SUBJECT: De-activation of Risk Acceptance/Evacuation Procedures Outlined in EAFBI 91-
207, Lightning Protection Deficiency Risk Acceptance and Evacuation of Eglin AFB Explosives
Areas
1. Reference AAC/SE Memorandum, [date], Activation of Risk Acceptance and the procedures
outlined in EAFBI 91-207, Lightning Protection in the Munitions Storage Area (attached).
AAC/SEW has determined the Lightning Protection System(s) (LPS) in question has been
repaired and certified IAW NFPA 780 and AFI 32-1065. Therefore, personnel evacuation when
lightning is within 10- nautical miles is no longer required.
2. Recommend you deactivate the procedures outlined in EAFBI 91-207.

MEMORANDUM FOR AAC/SEW
I now de-activate the evacuation requirement outlined in EAFBI 91-207 due to deficient
lightning Protection. Personnel evacuation during 10- mile lightning advisories is no longer
required.
