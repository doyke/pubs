This instruction implements AFPD 21-1, Air and Space Maintenance, 25 Feb 03. It is applicable
to all organizations tasked with responding to, or with responsibilities relating to, hydrazine
incidents. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of
Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of
Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through the appropriate functionalâ€™s chain of
command. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information Management
System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
af61a/afrims/afrims/.

1. GENERAL: Hydrazine incidents can be categorized or defined as Emergency Start System
(ESS) activation in-flight, ESS activation on the ground, hydrazine spills or leakage, or crash of a
U-2S/T aircraft.
   1.1. For the purpose of hydrazine response, two distinct zones shall be defined:
       1.1.1. Hot Zone. A 150-foot perimeter around the aircraft or facility. Only Hydrazine
       Response Team (HRT) members will enter this area until the area is determined free of
       hydrazine leakage. The only exception to this rule will be for properly equipped fire and
       rescue personnel if it becomes necessary to extract the pilot/ground run operator. The
       security police will establish entry/exit control points (ECPs) to route non-participants
       from the Hot Zone.
 2                                                            BEALEAFBI21-180 8 JUNE 2011


        1.1.2. Cordon Area. A perimeter outward from the Hot Zone, only in the event of a
        hydrazine leak. All personnel will immediately evacuate the area to a minimum of 100
        feet upwind/500 feet downwind from the aircraft or facility. The Security Forces will
        establish an ECP and permit only the following agencies access: HRT, Fire Department,
        Crash Recovery, Bioenvironmental (BEE), Ambulance, Maintenance Squadron
        Supervision, and any other agency the Incident Commander (IC) deems necessary.
2. RESPONSIBILITIES:
     2.1. Maintenance Squadron (MXS):
        2.1.1. The Fuel Shop (MXMCF) will be the office of primary responsibility for the HRT.
            2.1.1.1. Will develop checklist for responding to hydrazine incidents.
            2.1.1.2. Will establish 24-hour procedures for manning and equipping an HRT, i.e.,
            recall procedures.
WARNING: Only HRT members shall attempt to contain or neutralize a hydrazine leak and or
spill, since specialized training and equipment are required.
     2.2. Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) will develop operating instructions and/or
     checklists for notifying all required organizations in the event of a hydrazine incident, leak,
     or spill.
     2.3. Security Forces Squadron (SFS):
        2.3.1. Will develop a checklist for establishing flightline ECPs, routing all non-essential
        personnel away from hydrazine incidents.
        2.3.2. Coordinate with local law enforcement agencies to secure crash scenes and
        minimize the danger of hydrazine contamination and ensure public safety.
        2.3.3. Will provide an individual to function as liaison with the Fire Chief, normally the
        Security Flight Sergeant.
        2.3.4. Will establish the appropriate cordon area in accordance with disaster response
        procedures when directed by the IC.
     2.4. Civil Engineering Squadron (CES):
        2.4.1. The Base Fire Department will act as IC for all hydrazine incidents.
        2.4.2. Environmental Management (CEV) will provide guidance for the disposal of
        neutralized hydrazine IAW applicable laws and regulations.
     2.5. Medical Group (MDG):
        2.5.1. Will approve all HRT personal protective equipment. They will respond to HRT
        incidents as requested by the HRT and/or Civil Engineering Flight (CEF).
        2.5.2. Flight surgeons from Aerospace Medical Services will develop operation
        instructions for responding to hydrazine medical emergencies.
     2.6. Wing Safety (SE):
        2.6.1. Respond as required.

3. HYDRAZINE INCIDENT RESPONSE:
  3.1. ESS activation in-flight or while taxiing:
     3.1.1. Pilot will accomplish checklist procedures for activated ESS/hydrazine leak and:
         3.1.1.1. Contact Beale tower and declare an emergency.
         3.1.1.2. If a hydrazine leak is noted, stop aircraft movement to avoid spreading
         contamination. Otherwise, fighters will taxi aircraft to Taxiway M during daylight,
         and Taxiway B or E during darkness or inclement weather (Taxiway M is unlit/closed
         at night). U-2 and other aircraft will taxi to Taxiway B or E.

         actions according to the hydrazine spill/clean-up checklist.
         3.1.1.6. If hydrazine is present, a firefighter will evacuate the pilot from the aircraft.
         The HRT will begin clean-up procedures IAW local checklist. BEE will ensure the
         hydrazine is properly neutralized and clear the area for reentry.
  3.2. ESS activation during ground run or maintenance (including activation prior to taxi):
     3.2.1. The ground run operator/pilot will notify Ground Control.
     3.2.2. Airfield Management will activate secondary crash net.

     appropriate action according to hydrazine spill/clean-up checklist (fuel shop).
     3.2.7. If a hydrazine incident occurs inside a facility, the structure will remain evacuated
     until cleared for reentry by BEE personnel.
