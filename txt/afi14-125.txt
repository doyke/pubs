                     CRYPTOLOGIC MISSION CERTIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. Upon assignment to any line flying unit, Airborne Cryptologic Linguists will enter Cryptologic Mis-
sion Certification Training. This training should be completed within 120 days from the date of arrival to
the line flying unit. (ANG will complete CMCT and initial CSPT at the Senior Scout FTU in conjunction
with MQT.)

2.2. CMCT. All Airborne Cryptologic Linguists, regardless of unit of assignment, will complete
area-specific CMCT before flying unsupervised on any operational sortie in a given area. CMCT pro-
grams are developed for all Airborne Cryptologic Linguist crew positions by designated lead units of pri-
mary responsibility and apply to all operators assigned in that position regardless of assigned unit. Each
CMCT plan will be coordinated with and approved by OG/CC designated office of primary responsibility
(OPR).
    2.2.1. CMCT for CTL linguist positions (see Paragraph 1.4.1.9.), at a minimum, include the follow-
    ing: target/area knowledge (vocabulary/terminology, target knowledge/order of battle, geography),
    and aural exercises (transcription).
    2.2.2. CMCT for LCTL linguist positions (see Paragraph 1.4.1.9.) will be determined by the squadron
    with the predominance of that particular LCTL asset and, at a minimum, include the following: target/
    area knowledge (vocabulary/terminology, target knowledge/order of battle, and geography), and when
    possible, aural exercises (transcription).
    2.2.3. CMCT for mission management (ie. AMS, AA, DLO) positions will, at a minimum, include
    the following: target academics (area specific order of battle/tactics, geo-political, analysis and report-
    ing, threat warning and SIGINT mission management).

2.3. Completion of CMCT is required to attain CMC status for the applicable area. Successful completion
will be validated through the administration of a comprehensive CSPT which will cover all areas of cryp-
tologic training. Completion of CMCT will be documented, with inclusion of CSPT score, on an AF Form
1381 USAF Certification of Aircrew Training, or equivalent, and placed in the member‚Äôs training folder.
The squadron operations officer will designate certifying officials.

2.4. Once an Airborne Cryptologic Linguist has achieved CMC for a given area, he or she will be
required to complete CMCT continuation training IAW Attachment 2.

2.5. RC-135 MDS Airborne Cryptologic Linguists will fly operational sorties in area a minimum of once
every 180 days in order to maintain CMC status for a given area. Reserve personnel may use simulated
operational missions to comply with this requirement. The first flight in area will occur within 180 days
of certification. Waiver authority for this requirement is AFISRA/A3 and will not be delegated lower than
AFISRA/A3.

                         CRYPTOLOGIC SKILLS PROFICIENCY TEST

3.1. All Airborne Cryptologic Linguists who successfully complete area-specific CMCT are required to
pass a CSPT at least once every 17 months to maintain CMC. Airborne Cryptologic Linguists, who fail to
successfully accomplish a CSPT event for any particular mission area, lose CMC for that area. Command-
ers will direct additional training, as necessary to ensure all Airborne Cryptologic Linguists attain and
maintain a state of proficiency which will permit immediate and successful completion of the unit‚Äôs
assigned mission.

3.2. CSPT. The CSPT measures the results of the CMCT process. It provides a snapshot on each area
trained and is used for overall process improvement. Each CSPT will be designed to measure the skills
attained through CMCT and should equally cover all areas provided in CMCT for that entity.
   3.2.1. Target knowledge tests will consist of any combination of target weapon system capability/tac-
   tics, subordination, location/areas, functional association, scenario identification, and general knowl-
   edge items.
   3.2.2. Aural skills evaluations methods may range from target specific transcription proficiency
   checks to aural recognition tests. Aural skills evaluation methods will be determined on specific unit
   mission requirements. Minimum passing scores for tests is 85%.

3.3. Units will administer the CSPT in accordance with the following guidelines:
   3.3.1. IAW the timelines/frequency specified in Attachment 2.
   ** Note: Depending on mission requirements, units may require more frequent testing, e.g., in con-
   junction with an individual‚Äôs qualification evaluation cycle to line up with area recertification require-
   ments.
   3.3.2. A no-notice CSPT will be administered annually for a percentage of qualified Airborne Cryp-
   tologic Linguists as determined by Wings and subordinate Groups. A no-notice testing program pro-
   vides commanders a sampling of daily airborne cryptologic linguist performance and an assessment
   of unit training effectiveness.
   3.3.3. CSPT for CTL linguist positions (see Paragraph 1.4.1.9.) will, at a minimum, include the fol-
   lowing: academic examination (vocabulary/terminology, target knowledge/order of battle, and geog-
   raphy), and aural skills evaluation (transcription/aural recognition).
   3.3.4. CSPT for LCTL linguist positions (see Paragraph 1.4.1.9.) will be determined by the squadron
   with the preponderance of the particular LCTL assets and, at a minimum, includes the following: aca-
   demic examination (vocabulary/terminology, target knowledge/order of battle, and geography). If a
   complete CSPT battery exists for a LCTL, then the full test will be administered. If there is no CSPT
   for a specific language, the unit commander may waive any or all of the CSPT requirements for that
   language and appoint individuals as initial cadre, for CSPT purposes. Initial cadre individuals will be
   considered CMC until sufficient CSPT material is available. Document waivers on a Memorandum
   for Record (MFR), and place in the individual‚Äôs training folder.
   3.3.5. CSPT for 1A8X1 mission management (ie AMS, AA, DLO) positions will include an academic
   examination of the following material: area-specific order of battle/tactics, geo/political, analysis and
8                                                                              AFI14-125 30 JULY 2008


    reporting, threat warning, and SIGINT mission management (cryptanalysis, signals analysis, language
    analysis, and intelligence analysis). CSPT for these positions will also include an aural skills evalua-
    tion in the crewmember‚Äôs primary Resource Language Allocation (RLA) code. Aural skills evaluation
    requirements will be as directed by the OG.
    3.3.6. CMC operators who have completed certification in multiple areas may take combined aca-
    demic tests when practical. However, a separate aural skills evaluation must be completed for each
    area of certification. In order to maintain CMC status, operators must be certified in at least one area.
    More specifically, an operator who is CSPT certified in more than one area need only take one CSPT,
    according to the frequency listed in Attachment 2, in order to maintain CMC status.
    3.3.7. Failure to pass a CSPT will result in loss of CMC status for that language/area certification. The
    affected individual will not participate as a crew member on operational missions in that language/
    area, unsupervised unless specifically waived. Place waiver in the individual‚Äôs training folder.
    3.3.8. Restore CMC status by re-testing and successfully completing the CSPT.
       3.3.8.1. Re-testing will be accomplished no sooner than three duty days after the first failure. In
       the event of second failure, a third CSPT will be administered. In this situation the squadron com-
       mander will determine a sufficient period of time for study and additional training/preparation and
       will be documented in the member‚Äôs training folder.
       3.3.8.2. Document additional training/preparation time in the individual‚Äôs training folder. Detail
       what additional training was accomplished, time spent accomplishing the training, and the total
       number of hours spent completing additional training and study, and any extenuating circum-
       stances.
       3.3.8.3. Individuals failing to successfully complete the CSPT after three attempts are no longer
       certified to perform the cryptologic operational duties of an airborne cryptologic linguist. The unit
       will convene a special board chaired by the unit commander to review the case and: (1) make a
       recommendation to re-enter the individual into additional training; (2) seek a waiver, or (3) request
       a Flight Evaluation Board (FEB) in accordance with AFI 11-402 Aviation and Parachutist Ser-
       vice, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, paragraph 4.3.5.
    3.3.9. Completion of the CSPT requirement will be documented in Aviation Resource Management
    System (ARMS), and individual training folders. ARMS documentation procedures and event code
    descriptions are located in Attachment 2.

Terms
Aircrew‚ÄîThe total complement of rated, career enlisted aviators (1AXXX Air Force Specialty Codes),
and nonrated aircrew (K-, Q-, or X-prefixed Air Force Specialty Code) personnel responsible for the safe
ground and flight operation of the aircraft and onboard systems, or for airborne duties essential to
accomplishment of the aircraft‚Äôs mission. Includes members in initial formal training for immediate
assignment to an authorized operational flying position. Individuals must be on aeronautical orders and
assigned to an authorized position according to AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Factors, or
nonrated aircrew not in an aircraft‚Äôs basic crew complement, but required for the mission. Aircrew
members perform their principal duties inflight and their presence is required for the aircraft to
accomplish its primary tasked mission. Duties must be essential to operating the aircraft or mission
systems and equipment used for completing a mission, or other duties essential to the aircraft‚Äôs mission.
Airborne Cryptologic Skills Proficiency‚ÄîContinuation Training consisting of select, entity specific,
cryptologic training used to attain, maintain and improve cryptologic skills in the assigned, or previously
assigned, target entity or RLA. Cryptologic Skills Proficiency consists of Target Academic Knowledge
(Vocabulary/Terminology, Target Knowledge/Order of Battle, Geography), and Aural Exercises
(Transcription). While target academic knowledge is key, and a building block for cryptologic
proficiency; for linguists, language transcription exercises are essential and should be the basis of every
Cryptologic Skills Proficiency program.
Commonly Taught Language (CTL)‚ÄîLanguages where there are higher numbers of requirements and/
or throughput in the training pipeline. Current list includes: Arabic, Chinese, Korean, Persian-Farsi,
Russian, and Spanish. Designation of languages as CTL or LCTL may be revised by the 1A8XX Career
Field Manager.
Continuation Training‚ÄîThe continuation training program provides crew members with the volume,
frequency, and mix of training necessary to maintain proficiency in the assigned qualification level or
certification.
Cryptologic Skills Experienced‚ÄîLinguists CMC in their RLA for more than 1 year and with more than
250 hours in the applicable RLA, for the purpose of Airborne CSP will be considered experienced.
Non-experienced/Experienced status for Airborne CSP is based on total hours as an Airborne Cryptologic
Linguist in the applicable RLA, not total MDS specific hours.

required to conduct or support cryptologic operations contained in the Direct Cryptologic Program or the
Consolidated Cryptologic Program.
Less Commonly Taught Language (LCTL)‚ÄîAll languages not designated as a Commonly Taught
Language (CTL). Designation of languages as CTL or LCTL may be revised by the 1A8XX Career Field
Manager.
No-Notice Evaluation‚ÄîAn evaluation where the examinee is notified of the evaluation at or after the
beginning of the normal preparation for the mission.
Primary Resource Language Allocation‚ÄîFor the purposes of this instruction Primary RLA is the
language an Airborne Cryptologic Linguist is billeted for. For linguists in slick billets the Primary RLA is
the language most recently trained in.
Resource Language Allocation‚ÄîDigraph or code used to indicate an authorized language identity is
required. Language, other than English, is required to perform the duties of the position.
Subject Matter Expert‚ÄîPerson serving as the content expert, responsible for ensuring the accuracy of
course or module content.
Transcription‚ÄîThe action of turning audio into text. Transcription may be done on- or off-line.
Transcription vehicles include, but are not limited to a hand-scan, gist, edited-transcript, and
verbatim-transcript. IAW 1A8X1 CFETP, Paragraph 4.2.8. Duties and Responsibilities: Maintain skills
