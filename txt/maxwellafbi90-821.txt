SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This rewrite aligns the numbering convention with the Air Force Instruction, addresses
Hazardous Communication (HAZCOM) training changes and various point of contact updates.

1. General Information. Each work area will maintain a workplace written hazardous
communication program which will include the following: a copy of this instruction, AFI 90-
821, the work area hazardous chemical inventory, Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for each
item listed on the inventory and a list of the non-routine tasks performed in the work center that
involve hazardous materials. A work area is defined as a room or defined space in a workplace
where hazardous materials are produced or used and where employees are present. This written
program provides information specific to the implementation of AFI 90-821 at Maxwell AFB
and associated mission partners. The workplace written hazardous communication program will
be maintained at each work area and include the following:
2                                                 MAXWELLAFBI90-821 18 MARCH 2014

    1.1. A copy of this written workplace plan to include a copy of AFI 90-821 as Attachment 1.

    1.2. The work area hazardous chemical inventory as Attachment 2.

    1.3. A list of the non-routine tasks performed in the work center involving hazardous
    materials as Attachment 3.

2. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS)/Safety Data Sheets (SDS).

    2.1. MSDS/SDS information will be readily available to all workers through the Hazardous
    Material Information Resource System (HMIRS) Online Web Application
    (http://www.dlis.dla.mil/hmirs/) — a web-based system used by workers at industrial
    facilities to access electronic hazardous material documents assigned to specific work
    locations in each facility.

    2.2. Workers desiring additional MSDS/SDS information will contact Bioenvironmental
    Engineering (BE) to establish a mutually acceptable time during the current work shift to
    review the MSDS/SDS. A BE Flt member will review the MSDS/SDS with the employee
    and provide an explanation of the MSDS/SDS information.

    2.3. Supervisors will notify BE before a new chemical is introduced into the work area. If
    BE personnel determines HMIRS, MSDS/SDS or equivalent information is not available, BE
    will attempt to obtain the MSDS/SDS using established procedures.

3. Employee Information and Training.

    3.1. Unit commanders will ensure supervisors of work areas using hazardous materials
    receive training using guidance found in AFI 90-821, paragraph 2.7. Public Health (PH) is
    the point of contact for occupational health education and provides consultation on training
    and technical matters to work area/shop supervisors on the Air Force Hazard Communication
    (HAZCOM) Program. While primary responsibility for performing HAZCOM training rests
    with the work area/shop supervisor, HAZCOM training can also be obtained online at the
    following website http://www.free-training.com/osha/hazcom/hazmenu.htm.

    3.2. Supervisors will ensure subordinate workers are trained IAW AFI 90-821, paragraph
    2.7, “Employee Information and Training.” This training may be provided by the supervisor,
    the organization occupational health coordinator or other formal organization training
    structure (i.e., maintenance trainers). Supervisors should supplement this training to provide
    information on work-area specific chemical hazards. Before presenting supplemental
    training, the supervisor will ensure the following appropriate agencies review the information
    for technical accuracy:

       3.2.1. BE (42 AMDS/SGPB, 953-5848)

       3.2.2. PH (42 AMDS/SGPM, 953-5616)

       3.2.3. Safety (42 ABW/SE, 953-2001)
MAXWELLAFBI90-821 18 MARCH 2014                                                               3

      3.2.4. Fire Department Technical Services (42 CES/CEF, 953-5870)

      3.2.5. Environmental Coordinator (BOS Contractor, 953-5260)

4. Hazardous Chemical Inventory.

   4.1. The hazardous chemical inventory for the workcenter will be developed by the work
   area supervisor. BE will review this inventory IAW the workplace priority established in
   AFI 48-145, Occupational and Environmental Health Program, or as necessary.

   4.2. The supervisors will maintain the hazardous chemicals inventory in the work area and
   update it as necessary. Prior to introducing new chemicals into the workplace, the supervisor
   will consult with the Hazardous Materials Pharmacy (953-5196) to initiate an AF Form 3952,
   Chemical/Hazardous Material Request Authorization Form.

   4.3. The written work area/shop hazard communication program must include a list of
   hazardous chemicals known to be present in a work area/shop (the list may be compiled for
   the work area/shop as a whole or for specified and readily distinguishable portions of a work
   area/shop). The identity used on the MSDS must be cross-referenced to the inventory.
   Where accessible, the inventory may be maintained in the Environmental, Safety and
   Occupational Health – Management Information System (ESOH-MIS).

5. Contractor Operations.

   5.1. The Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO), (42 CONS/LGCA, 953-3525), with
   assistance from BE and work area supervisor, if requested, will advise contractors of
   hazardous chemicals they may encounter in the normal course of their work in the applicable
   work area. The ACO will also inform the contractor MSDS information is available through
   the HMIRS (http://www.dlis.dla.mil/hmirs/).

   5.2. At the pre-performance conference, and subsequently during the contract performance
   period, the requiring activity quality assurance evaluator will advise work area supervisors
   and AF employees monitoring the performance of contractors of hazardous chemicals
   introduced by the contractor. The contractor is required to submit information on the use of
   hazardous materials according to Federal Acquisition Register clause 5352.223.9002,
   Hazardous Material Identification and Material Safety Data.

6. Non-Routine Tasks Involving Hazardous Materials.

   6.1. Non-routine tasks are:

      6.1.1. Those tasks included within a work area’s normal activities but performed
      infrequently; for example, a medical technician performing preventive maintenance on
      the shop’s lawnmower, to include changing oil.

      6.1.2. Temporary duties outside an individual’s normal Air Force Specialty Code or job
      series.

    6.2. The work area supervisor will list all non-routine tasks performed in the work area
    which involve hazardous material and file as Attachment 3 in the workplace specific written
    hazardous communication program as specificed in paragraph 1. The supervisor will ensure
    work area operating instructions (OI) thoroughly describe non-routine tasks, associated
    hazards and controls for the infrequent tasks performed in this work area. OIs do not need to
    be prepared if technical orders or other official documents adequately describe these tasks.
    Supervisors will ensure workers review these procedures before performing any non-routine
    tasks.

    6.3. When workers temporarily perform duties outside their normal jobs, the supervisor of
    the activity will ensure these workers receive the following training prior to beginning the
    activity:

       6.3.1. The initial Employee Information and Training Program described in paragraph
       2.7. of AFI 90-821 for workers not previously trained.

       6.3.2. Supplemental training, as necessary, on work-area specific chemical hazards and
       associated controls.

    6.4. The supervisor of the activity will forward a letter to the worker’s formal supervisor
    describing the training conducted so the individual’s AF Form 55, Employee Safety and
    Health Record, or equivalent product (e.g. AFFORMs, CAMs, CAS-B, GO81) can be
    updated.

7. Container Labeling Procedures and Requirements.

    7.1. Labeling of hazardous chemical containers will be done according to 29 CFR
    1910.1200(f) and DoDI 6050.05, DoD Hazard Communication (HAZCOM) Program.

    7.2. Refer to AFI 90-821, section 2.6, for additional information.

8. Work Area/Shops Producing Hazardous Chemicals. Work area/shops producing
hazardous chemicals will comply with AFI 90-821, section 2.4.
